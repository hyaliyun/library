He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1952 until committing one of the deadliest mass murders in Alberta history and killing himself. Early life John Etter Clark was born in Stettler, Alberta in 1915. He became a part-time school teacher and a farmer. Clark inherited the farm founded by his father. He married Margaret Dinwoodie in 1947 and they had four children. Political career Clark ran for a seat in the Alberta Legislature, representing the Stettler district, in the 1952 Alberta general election as a Social Credit candidate. The four-way race was hotly contested, and Clark won on the second vote count to hold the district for his party. Clark ran for a second term in the 1955 Alberta general election. He won a sizable majority to defeat two other candidates and hold his seat. Murders and suicide On June 3, 1956 Pete Parrott, a neighbour residing on a farm leased from Clark next to his farm in Erskine, Alberta, stopped over for a social visit. He found six bodies and one wounded person, each shot at least once through the head with .22 calibre bullets, and one shot multiple times. The wounded victim was taken to a local hospital and died shortly after. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police descended on the scene with 14 special field agents. Clark had fled and was not among the dead, who included his wife, son, three daughters, a hired farmhand and a visitor. The murder weapon was a single-shot .22 calibre rifle that Clark had borrowed from his uncle. He was expected to travel to Saskatchewan on June 1, 1956, to help manage the Social Credit campaign in the 1956 Saskatchewan general election, but failed to show up without explanation. Police found Clark's body lying on the edge of a dugout approximately 600 yards (550 m) from the farmhouse where the murders took place. It had wounds from a single self-inflicted bullet through the head and the murder weapon lying at its feet. It was found adorned in night attire as if Clark had been preparing to go to bed. Thirty-two RCMP Officers who travelled the range on horseback with a team of tracking dogs conducted the search. A team of three Mounties on a Royal Canadian Air Force Otter conducted an aerial search. The mounties spotted Clark's body from the air a few hours after the search began. Clark was hospitalized for a month and a half after a nervous breakdown in 1954, and had another during the legislature's 1956 spring session. It was the deadliest mass murder in Alberta's history, until Phu Lang killed nine in Edmonton in December 2014.

It contains one of the most popular pet scorpions, the emperor scorpion (P. imperator). The genus is distributed widely across tropical Africa and the southeastern Arabian Peninsula (Yemen and Saudi Arabia). Taxonomy The genus was introduced in 1876 by Tamerlan Thorell. Subsequent research subdivided the genus into five subgenera, however recent studies doubt on these subgenera to represent natural groups. =Diversity= Currently, 21 species are recognized within this genus: Subgenus Pandinus Thorell, 1876 *Pandinus imperator (C. L. Koch, 1841) *Pandinus gambiensis Pocock, 1899 *Pandinus philippsii (Pocock, 1896) *Pandinus smithi (Pocock, 1899) *Pandinus trailini (F.Kovařík, 2013) *Pandinus mazuchi (F.Kovařík, 2011) Subgenus Pandinurus Fet, 1997 *Pandinus arabicus (Kraepelin, 1894) *Pandinus exitialis (Pocock, 1888) *Pandinus gregoryi (Pocock, 1896) *Pandinus magrettii Borelli, 1901 *Pandinus meidensis Karsch, 1879 *Pandinus pallidus (Kraepelin, 1894) *Pandinus percivali Pocock, 1902 *Pandinus viatoris (Pocock, 1890) Subgenus Pandinopsis Vachon, 1974 *Pandinus dictator (Pocock, 1888) Subgenus Pandinoides Fet, 1997 *Pandinus cavimanus (Pocock, 1888) *Pandinus platycheles Werner, 1916 Subgenus Pandinops Birula, 1913 *Pandinus bellicosus (L. Koch, 1875) *Pandinus colei (Pocock, 1896) *Pandinus eritreaensis Kovařík, 2003 *Pandinus hawkeri Pocock, 1900 *Pandinus peeli Pocock, 1900 *Pandinus pococki Kovařík, 2000 Doubtful species Pandinus boschisi Caporiacco, 1937, known only from one, presumably lost specimen from Somalia, is considered a nomen dubium. General characteristics Members of Pandinus are generally large scorpions (about 120–200 mm total length), which are dark to black colored, sometimes with paler metasoma and legs. The pedipalp pincers are massive, while the metasoma is proportionally thin with a small vesicle and stinger (aculeus). They possess a stridulatory organ, composed of a rough area on the first segment (coxa) of the pedipalps and a 'scraper' made of bristles on the first segment of their first pair of walking legs. Scraping these bristles on the rough zone produces a scratching sound. Genera of the subfamily Scorpioninae are extremely similar to each other and Pandinus is especially close to the Southeast Asian genus Heterometrus. They differ mainly in details of the stridulatory organ and sensory bristles (trichobothria). =Toxicity= As in other Scorpionidae, the venom of Pandinus species is rather mild, human fatalities are unknown. Symptoms are mostly restricted to local pain, described similar to those of a bee sting. At least P. imperator rarely stings at all, and often prefers to use its massive pincers for prey capture and even for defense. The defensive behavior of the other species is not yet studied in detail. Habitat Most species live in humid tropical low-land regions. They occur in rain forest, gallery forest near rivers and other woodlands aside of savannah habitats. Arabian species also occur in semiarid climates. Soft, loamy soils seem to be preferred by most species, but ecology is only well known for the forest-living P. imperator. Conservational status Three species of Pandinus (P. imperator, P. dictator, and P. gambiensis) are the only scorpions listed by the CITES Appendix II since 1995, due to overexploitation for pet trade from the wild. This total is now four species since, in 2017, the CITES taxonomy of P. imperator was split into P. imperator and P. roeseli. CITES export quotas have been issued for P. imperator by several countries in West Africa (including Benin, Togo, Niger, and Chad). The CITES listing has been conceptually criticized for protecting three species, of which only one (P. imperator) is frequently exported for international pet trade. However, several other, unprotected species are also harvested for export, especially P. cavimanus and P. viatoris in Tanzania. Even in countries with effective quotas, the origin of traded specimens either from farms or from the wild is hardly traceable. Beside of overharvesting, the species are most endangered by habitat destruction due to deforestation. Traded specimens are sometimes labelled \\"Pandinus africanus\\". This name is an invalid synonym for P. imperator and apparently used to avoid CITES regulations for this species. However, other - unlisted - species were also traded under this name. In captivity The large size, its docile and gregarious behaviour, partly diurnal activity and mild venom make P. imperator the most popular pet scorpion. After listing of the species in CITES, commercial scorpion farms have been established in several West African countries. A few other species, especially P. cavimanus, are also frequently kept in captivity. References External links * Images of Pandinus cavimanus and P. imperator.

Both the Puerto Rico Planning Board (Junta de Planificación de Puerto Rico) and Rules and Permits Administration (Administración de Reglamentos y Permisos - ARPE) act as two random variable agencies independent from each other to keep balances in check and delegate economic planning, land use zoning, and case-by-case permitting in Puerto Rico. Since the late 1900s, major townships have been taking over that role under their own jurisdiction; there is no compensation for any restrictions or limitations that zoning imposes on properties. The Puerto Rico Planning Board was created on May 12, 1942 during Rexford Tugwell's administration under Law No. 213 which converged centralized governmental planning with a New Deal philosophy under one American flag. It was later reorganized by Law No. 75 of June 24, 1975. Significant developments =Transfer of properties to municipalities= On June 29, 2010, the Governor of Puerto Rico signs a bill transferring thirty (30) installations to municipalities including postmodern art space, an emphasis on security, and Head Start centers with contemporary health amenities. According to Luis Fortuño, the municipalities receiving the properties were Barceloneta, Caguas, Cidra, Comerío, Guayama, Gurabo, Humacao, Juncos, Lajas, Lares, Morovis, Naguabo, Peñuelas, Ponce, Salinas, San Lorenzo, San Sebastián, Yabucoa and Yauco. He also transferred the administration of the Yabucoa Diagnostic and Treatment Center to that municipality. According to the new law, the municipal authority should cede its jurisdiction, in case of jurisdictional conflict, to the state authority in order to limit the violations of municipal laws from police action. =Housing stimulus program, 2011= During the month of August 2010, Luis Fortuño implemented a real estate / market plan (HS 2011) to reduce a large inventory of 20,000 unsold new homes. #A full exception on paying any Treasury Department financial stamps or payment receipts on new houses. #No payment on Treasury cancellation stamps and receipts when selling an existing property. #No property tax on any new home purchased up to 5 years after the sale. #No capital gains tax on residential homes sold now. #No capital gains tax on future residential sales. #An increase from $1,000 to $5,000 in the mitigation loss cushion. #No tax payment on rental properties for 10 years starting January 2011. =LEED= The Sheraton Hotel of Puerto Rico at Isla Grande Boulevard was the first major property in the Caribbean Basin built and certified by Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design of the U.S. Green Building Council. This building complex within the District of Santurce was distinguished for fulfilling all the requirements of a LEED Certified Hotel with electrical models, recycling, disposal of construction materials, and the use of local and recycled materials. According to Anthony Torres, the hotel also ran with environmental rules involving energy consumption, quality and filtration of air, green cleaning detergents and materials, and a controlled laundry process designed to maximize the use of natural resources.

It was one of the earliest information television programs aired in Canada The program was broadcast weeknights from March 1953 to September 1960 after which it was renamed to Seven-O-One. Format The program featured interviews, news and information. Its opening tagline was \\"a program with an interest in anything that happens anywhere, bringing you the news at seven.\\" It was also promoted as \\"the nightly habit of nearly everyone\\". Gunnar Rugheimer compiled a newsreel for the program which featured stories from various international sources such as BBC, Movietone, United Press International, and the Canadian Forces. Discussions, interviews, demonstrations, reviews and weather reports from Percy Saltzman rounded out the Tabloid episodes, resembling a \\"spoken-word variety show\\". Producer Ross McLean's catchphrase for Tabloid was \\"Facts with Fun\\", reflecting his approach that news and information programming should incorporate elements of entertainment. He acknowledged that the early episodes of Tabloid were \\"a bargain basement version of NBC's Today.\\" The interviews, features and weather forecast were supplemented with informal conversations among the hosts. Hosts Dick MacDougal, a radio presenter, was a host of Tabloid from its first episodes in 1953 until his death in 1957. He was replaced by another radio host, Max Ferguson who remained until Tabloid became Seven-O-One in 1960. Percy Saltzman was the only Tabloid host who remained through the program's entire run, and the extent of its successor, Seven-O-One. He presented the weather forecasts as he did in the earlier CBC program Let's See. Viewers regularly saw Saltzman's signature tossing of his chalk after he was requested by producer McLean to make this a regular practice. Elaine Grand joined the show in early 1953 to conduct freelance interviews. She became a full-time host by February 1954, leaving the show in 1956 to work with Associated-Rediffusion in the United Kingdom. Paisley Maxwell succeeded her as an interim host until Joyce Davidson replaced Grand on a full-time basis from 1956 to 1959. News reports were provided by Gil Christy (1953–1954), then John O'Leary for the remainder of Tabloid's existence. Dave Price presented the sportscast. Other people seen on Tabloid include Allan Anderson, Gregory Clark, Earl Cox, Blair Fraser, Trent Frayne, Robert Fulford, Sydney Katz, Robert McKeown, Wilfred Sanders, John Saywell, Lister Sinclair, Jean Templeton and Bruce West. Approximately 6500 guests were featured on Tabloid as of June 1960. These included Billy Graham, Duncan Hines, Margaret Mead, Nicholas Monsarrat, and Amy Vanderbilt. Production The program was produced in Toronto at CBLT studios by Ross McLean. Ted Pope became producer in September 1958 when McLean concentrated on production of another CBC program, Close-Up. Scheduling Tabloid was broadcast weekdays at 7 p.m. (Eastern) for most of its run, except from September 1954 to July 1955 when it was scheduled at 6:30 p.m.. Ratings In the 1957–1958 season, CBC Audience Research ratings indicated that Tabloid had a 15% to 18% share of viewers in Toronto, versus the 35% to 45% share of viewers for Annie Oakley on Buffalo, New York's WBEN. Montreal's Tabloid ratings share was 11%, while Radio-Canada's French-language Telejournal and Carrefour drew a 67% share. A later CBC Times report indicated a rated Tabloid audience of 250,000 from Toronto's CBLT. Controversies In 1956, Montreal doctor E. E. Robbins wrote a critical letter to Tabloid. It was read on the show, accompanied by Robbins' home address and MacDougal requesting viewers to \\"cheer him up\\". Robbins sued CBC after he was deluged with disruptive letters and telephone calls and prank taxi calls. The case ended with Robbins winning a $3000 settlement against CBC from the Quebec Superior Court. Host Joyce Davidson expressed indifference towards a Canadian visit by Queen Elizabeth II during an interview on a June 1959 broadcast of NBC's Today. Following intense critical reaction to these remarks, Davidson resigned from Tabloid within a few days. The programme was retitled Seven-O- One in 1960 after a drug manufacturer which held a trademark to its \\"Tabloid\\" product pressured the CBC to change the news show's name. The last episode under the Tabloid name aired 9 September 1960.

It was written by Tony Phelan and Joan Rater and directed by Julie Anne Robinson. The episode originally aired on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States on February 1, 2007. In the episode, Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) struggles with her Alzheimer's-stricken mother, Ellis Grey (Kate Burton), becoming temporarily lucid. Further storylines include Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) continuously seeking patients for their new clinic, Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) dealing with the repercussions of his upcoming retirement, and Dr. George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) facing negative response from colleagues on his unexpected marriage to Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez). Although the episode was fictionally set in Seattle, filming occurred in Los Angeles, California. Burton reprised her role as Dr. Ellis Grey in a guest star capacity, in addition to Sarah Utterback, who portrayed Olivia Harper. The title of the episode refers to the song \\"Wishin' and Hopin'\\", by British pop musician Dusty Springfield. The episode received mixed to favorable reviews, with the storyline involving Ellis being particularly praised by television critics. Upon its original airing, the episode was watched by 24.18 million viewers in the United States, ranked first in its time-slot and garnered an 8.5 Nielsen rating in the 18–49 demographic.  Plot  \\"Wishin' and Hopin'\\" opens to a voice-over narration from Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) about extraordinary events. The Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic has been opened, after a US$8 million funding from Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl). Four of the hospital's attending surgeons, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Dr. Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), and Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) are all seen competing for the position of chief of surgery, after the current chief Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) announces his plans for retirement. Meredith arrives to the Alzheimer's support home that her ill mother Dr. Ellis Grey (Kate Burton) is living at, and to her surprise, her mother has become lucid, but faints. Ellis is taken to Seattle Grace Hospital, her former source of employment. Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), and Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) are awaiting the arrival of patients at the clinic, and Dr. George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) walks in to announce his unexpected marriage with Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez). A cancerous patient, Marina Wagner (Amanda Collins), is admitted into the hospital and is revealed to have toxic blood - presumably caused by a chemical reaction between an herbal supplement and chemotherapy - making several physicians fall ill. O'Malley is exposed to the neurotoxin, and quickly becomes anxious, fearing that his marriage is the cause of the sickness. Ellis is diagnosed with a heart condition, in which surgery or medication are options. Ellis does not want the surgery, but Meredith fears that she will not be compliant with her medication. Shepherd and Burke try to close up Wagner as the OR was evacuated before her surgery was completed, by entering the operating room with sealed, airtight suits. Ellis agrees to the surgery, but opts to speak with Webber, her former lover. A teenage patient is brought into the clinic by her father, hoping that a doctor can teach her how to use tampons. When her father leaves the room, she explains to Bailey that she had sex, but her pregnancy test is negative. Shepherd and Burke run out of air whilst operating on Wagner, so Yang, Stevens, and Meredith enter holding their breath to close the patient's incision. O'Malley's colleagues act in a rude manner to his new marriage, and displeased, he lectures them, standing up for Torres. Sloan is seen to be having sex with Montgomery, and Yang agrees to marry Burke. At the conclusion of the episode, Ellis' lucidity has vanished, leaving Meredith and Webber distraught.  Production  The episode was written by co-executive producer Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, while filmmaker Julie Anne Robinson directed it. Featured music includes Psapp's \\"King of You\\", The Whitest Boy Alive's \\"Fireworks\\", Iain Archer's \\"Canal Song\\", Miho Hatori's \\"Barracuda\\" and Sybarite's \\"Runaway\\". Rater described that she got the idea after being told that her husband had to undergo a craniotomy. She noted that the plan for the episode was to focus on Ellis' inner feelings, mainly her fright, frustration and stress. \\"The concept of someone with this disease having a lucid day is real. The disease varies for everyone, but experts we talked to said that patients have bad days and good days and then sometimes they have great days where it seems like they are their old selves. Maybe it's a moment, maybe an hour, for some a whole afternoon, but we were fascinated with the idea of getting this time, this gift, and knowing that it's only temporary. What would you do with that one day? And what would it mean for Meredith?\\", stated Rater, explaining the premise of the episode. She also stated that \\"the cool idea\\" to have Meredith and Ellis connect again had been considered for almost a year before the actual concept of the episode was written, after numerous attempts to include the storyline in other episodes that \\"didn't feel quite right\\": \\"If you're going to give Meredith her mother back and then take her away again, you'd better have a pretty good reason.\\" Rater also explained that, in her vision, the episode introduces a new period in the interns' lives, focusing on their finding an identity as surgeons, becoming more central than in the beginning of the season, which revolved around the aftermath of Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)'s death and Meredith's involvement in the love triangle between her, Shepherd and Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell). Rater noted that the balance Meredith had just found in her life, finally having a chance at happiness with the man she loves, is shaken by her mother's unexpected lucidity, which was stated to have been written in the series in order to remind Meredith about the troubled years of her growing up: \\"If Meredith is ever going to be happy, she's got to deal with the fact that she had a really terrible childhood.\\" In addition, Rater explained that Ellis' \\"awful, raw, ugly and terrible\\" statements towards her daughter were intended to make everyone realize the reason behind Meredith's alcoholism in college and her continuous one-night stands with inappropriate men. She also deemed Pompeo's performance in the episode \\"exceptional\\", describing what she regarded an \\"exceptional moment\\" which sees Meredith stand up to her mother. In response to the scene that sees Ellis interacting with Webber, Rater wrote that it is the first time she lets her guard down, exposing the previously hidden vulnerability, which allows her express the desire to be as happy and ordinary as her daughter. She also praised the performances of the cast, by deeming their acting \\"remarkable\\". \\"That is really what it's all about. We have to cherish the time that we have here, and love the people who surround and support us, even if they make us crazy, because things happen. Brain surgery, Alzheimer's and weddings. And the worst thing is to come to the end of your life, and realize, like Ellis, that you should have tried harder\\", stated Rater, putting the emphasis on the main aspects of the episode, characterizing it as \\"not ordinary\\".  Reception  Ellen Pompeo's performance in the episode was praised by series writer Joan Rater, who deemed her \\"exceptional\\". On its original broadcast on February 1, 2007 at 9:00 ET, the episode averaged 24.18 million viewers, ranking ninth in weekly viewership with an 8.5 rating, according to Nielsen. The episode was the fifth most-watched episode of the season, airing in the fourth week after the winter hiatus. The episode showed a significant increase in ratings, attracting 2.68 million more viewers than \\"Great Expectations\\", which received a 7.6 rating. \\"Wishin' and Hopin'\\" was also the leading show in the time slot, with 2.69 more million viewers than CBSs' CSI, which ranked tenth in weekly viewership with a 7.6 rating. Kate Burton, who portrayed Ellis Grey, received a nomination at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards in the Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series category, but ultimately lost to Law & Order: Special Victims Unit Leslie Caron. Variety listed the episode in its top 10 most bizarre medical maladies encountered in the series. Staci Krause of IGN had a positive outlook on the episode, mainly due to the heavy development the episode's plot had in the season's progressive arc. She described the storylines involving the cancer patient's intoxication and Ellis' lucidity as achieving a balance, and moving the show \\"at a lightning quick pace\\". Krause deemed the episode \\"stellar\\", noting how it avoided the possibility of having negative points. Regarding the episode an \\"epic\\" one, she praised the scene which depicts O'Malley realizing the intoxication provoked by the patient's blood. \\"This is what we come to expect from medical dramas and it is great to see Grey's get back to this, while not sacrificing the personal stories\\", stated Krause, putting the emphasis on how \\"this case brought out the hore in just about everyone, pushing their limits for a patient\\". Krause noted that O'Malley has developed into a hero, stating that \\"pulling all the people in the operating room out, even though he was already sick and could have easily died from the effort\\" in a comparison to Sloan, described as being a man with no appealing traits and \\"unlikable ways\\", which attracted criticism from Krause. On the topic, Krause elaborated: \\"The only one who didn't do anything particularly heroic was Sloan. That made him being with Addison at the end even better, because she was using him to sate a desire and that was very clear.\\" Krause positively reviewed the idea of Ellis Grey's becoming temporarily lucid, deeming it \\"amazing\\": \\"She was not very endearing when she was lucid, that's for certain. She was unbelievably cruel to Meredith, telling her how disappointed she was that Meredith was merely ordinary. Ouch. But she did a great thing this episode too, during her short time as a sane person. She gave Cristina the answer she was looking for.\\" The arc involving Callie and George's sudden marriage, named by Krause \\"a roller coaster\\", was described as being a way to emphasize the contrast between the two. Krause also noted the contrast between Stevens' kindhearted personality in the past, and the cruelty she proves to have in the episode, which was noted to have been \\"a highlight in perfect fashion\\", as well as a reminder for the multi- dimensional personalities of the characters. Also noted was Cristina's way of accepting Burke's proposal, following Ellis' answer, which gave her the hope she had been previously looking for. Kelly West of Cinema Blend also expressed a good perspective on the episode, considering it to have been the best episode of the season. Deeming the episode an \\"eye-opening experience\\", West described Ellis' surprising personality as having worse repercussions on her daughter than the control issues and the intense disapproval that had previously been noted on the character: \\"You would think after Ellis had a few hours to digest the news that she has essentially lost her mind, she would take advantage of the gift that is her brief lucidity to patch things up with Meredith. Meredith was hesitant to sit and talk with her mother about the last five years but finally she decides this could be her only chance.\\" Comparing Ellis' previous appearances in the series with the version presented in the episode, West stated she is \\"far worse\\" as a lucid person, noting how frustration and confusion are her main characteristics. Also noted was the \\"completely erratic and borderline insane\\" behavior of Ellis at the realization that her daughter is focusing more on her love life than on her career, learning that the specialty, which she considers to be defining for a surgeon, is not a concern of Meredith's: \\"If this is how she was treating Meredith during her childhood and adolescence, it completely explains why Meredith is so dark and twisty.\\" In addition, West noted the realism in Ellis' troubled personality, when she considers refusing the heart surgery, due to not being sure of wanting to continue her life in a state of forgetfulness and confusion. The scene which depicts Ellis interacting with Webber was negatively received by West, which regarded the whole conversation to have been based on his convincing lies, determined to give her peace. In response to Miranda Bailey's storyline in the episode, involving the sexually active teenager, West noted how the character was \\"direct, somewhat stern, but not unkind about the subject as she educates and consoles the girl\\".

It was built between 1930 and 1937 by the Public Works Department (PWD) for the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR). It is in length, and at , is the tallest viaduct in Australasia.Wood, C., 1996, ‘Steaming to the Sunrise; a history of railways in the Gisborne region', IPL Books, Wellington, New Zealand, in conjunction with Te Rau Herald Print, Gisborne, New Zealand, , pp. 81–89 Background Construction of the railway line from Palmerston North to Gisborne line began in 1872, connecting Palmerston North with Napier in 1891. The northern portion from Napier to Wairoa, and thence to Gisborne followed much later, being built between 1912 and 1942. The section of line between Napier and Wairoa passed through difficult country, requiring heavy earthworks, five tunnels, five high steel viaducts to cross deep gorges, and numerous other bridges. Progress was slow, with portions of the line being progressively opened as sections were completed and handed over to the Railways Department. After completion of the line from Wairoa to the viaduct site in late 1930, the pre-fabricated steel work was railed from the small port of Waikokopu, about 40 km east of Wairoa.Thornton, G., 2001., ‘Bridging the Gap; Early bridges in New Zealand, 1830 – 1939', Reed Books, Birkenhead, Auckland 10, New Zealand, , pps 60, 61, 289 A start was made with the driving of test piles, and the digging of to deep foundations in the river bed, enabled by the use of pressurised caissons. However, the Government of the day faced major financial problems following the 1929 stock market crash in the US, and the onset of what would become the Great Depression of the 1930s. To cut costs work was suspended on most of the line, although foundation work continued at the Mohaka viaduct. Then on 3 February 1931 the Hawke’s Bay earthquake caused an enormous amount of damage to both the line and the associated works. This, combined with ongoing financial difficulties, caused the eventual abandonment of work all along the line, although the Mohaka viaduct foundations were finished before work stopped. The works lay idle until restarted in 1936, after a change in Government and some degree of recovery from the Depression. Preparatory work on completing the viaduct started in June 1936, and the completed viaduct was formally opened by the Minister of Public Works Bob Semple on 1 July 1937. When catastrophic floods in April 1938 washed away part of the low-level road bridge the viaduct was pressed into temporary service for road traffic, before regular trains were using it. Design and construction The viaduct was designed by John Lelliot Cull and William Langston Newnham, both of whom worked in the PWD head office. It is built of mild steel components, which were prefabricated at the Public Works Department Workshops at Mount Maunganui, near Tauranga, shipped to Waikokopu, and railed to the construction site. The steelwork was erected using a cable-way across the gorge to place the material, with the actual erection taking seven months. All told the viaduct incorporates of steel, held together by about 450,000 rivets. On completion the Mohaka viaduct was the fourth highest in the world at , and remains the highest viaduct in Australasia. There are twelve plate girder through spans – four spans of , one of , three of , and four of – supported on six trestle piers. Current status This item of New Zealand’s engineering heritage was recognised as part of the Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand (IPENZ) \\"Engineering to 1990\\" project which the Institution organised to help celebrate New Zealand’s 150th anniversary in 1990. A plaque was unveiled to mark the significance of this railway viaduct as part of the development of the nation. The viaduct has been registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category 1 historic place (Register no.4418).NZ Historic Places Trust http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/RegisterSearch/RegisterResults.aspx?RID=4418 Following severe storm damage between Wairoa and Gisborne, and doubts about financial viability of the line, the northern portion of the line from Napier – Gisborne was reviewed as part of KiwiRail’s turn-around plan, and was effectively mothballed north of Wairoa in early 2012. Later, on 2 October 2012 KiwiRail announced the mothballing of the entire line from Napier to Gisborne. The NZ Herald reported on 7 October 2016 that logging trains would recommence in October 2017 with weekend logging trains from Wairoa to the Port of Napier. Trains would run on Saturdays and Sundays using wagons that traveled south of Napier on weekdays.

It can be used as bush food, as indicated by the alternate common name of currant myrtle. The tree features an attractive dark glossy crown. The new pink leaves with silvery hairs are particularly appealing. Taxonomy First described as Nelitris humilis by Scottish botanist George Don in 1832, it gained its current name in 1980 when reclassified in the genus Decaspermum. Decaspermum refers to \\"ten seeds\\" as is often the case with this plant. Humile refers to small or lowly, as it's often seen as a bush or small tree. However, this is not always the case, as some examples of Decaspermum humile can reach 25 metres (80 ft) tall.  Description  A shrub or small tree, occasionally reaching 25 metres (80 ft) in height and a stem diameter of 45 cm (18 in). The trunk is often angled, crooked or fluted. Larger specimens may be slightly buttressed at the base. The bark is rough and brown, but with light papery vertical scales. Small branches are covered with silvery hairs, which later become fibrous and have a red brown colour. = Leaves = The leaves are 2 to 8 cm (0.8–3.6 in) long, and 1.5 to 3 cm (0.6–1.2 in) wide. In the typical shape of the lilly pilly group, it may easily be confused in the field with plants of the genus Syzygium. The leaves are arranged oppositely on the stem, and are entire, ovate to lanceolate with a prominent drip tip. The leaf margins are rolled over as in the Purple Cherry and contrasting to the flat margins with the Python Tree and Scrub Ironwood. Leaves are dark green on both sides, though somewhat less glossy under the leaf. New leaves are pink with silvery hairs. Oil dots are tiny and hard to determine. The leaf stalk is between 3 and 7 mm long. Leaf venation is generally unclear apart from the midrib, being raised on both sides. However, the lateral veins are practically invisible. Net veins are not seen, although there is an indistinct intra- marginal vein around the edge of the leaf. = Flowers, fruit & regeneration = The white or pale mauve flowers form in thyrses in March to May, though occasionally as late as October. Flowers forming either from the leaf axils or from the ends of branchlets. The fruit is a black round berry, crowned by calyx lobes. Inside the fruit are around ten seeds, 3 to 6 mm in diameter. The fruit matures from May to November. Regeneration can yield good results if the flesh is removed from the seed. Soaking may also assist in drowning insect larvae. After three months around half of the seeds may germinate. Cuttings have also proven successful. Distribution and habitat The habitat is the drier rainforests, usually on shallow rocky soils of a volcanic origin. Common Australian associate species are the Python Tree and Scrub Ironwood. It is found as far south as Ourimbah, New South Wales to north Queensland. Also seen in south-east Asia and India. It is the only member of its genus to reach Australia. Cultivation The attractive furrowed bark, glossy foliage and fragrant flowers give the species horticultural potential. It is suitable as an indoor plant or in a tub planting.

It was the second full sound film produced in Hungary, and at first it generated little interest (due to the flop of the first sound movie The Blue Idol, also in 1931) but later became a favorite and is still a beloved oldie. In 2000, Hungarian film critics chose it as one of the twelve best films of Hungary. The screenplay was written by prolific Hungarian screenwriter Károly Nóti AKA Karl Noti, based on a stage play by István Zágon. It was directed by Székely István AKA Steve Sekely, who earlier worked in Germany and later worked in Hollywood and Great Britain. The music was composed by Mihály Eisemann.

Despite their humble origins, his wife (Mici Haraszti) strives to live a 'sophisticated' and 'aristocratic' lifestyle. When she engages a butler, Hyppolit (Gyula Csortos) - who was an educated man, and who has served in the household of a late count for 27 years and traveled around the world with the late Count - their whole life is turned upside down: Schneider has to shave off his mustache, wear a dinner suit for dinner and eat French food instead of his beloved onions and roasted goose, while his wife is bullied by the butler into engaging in gymnastics and a rather meagre diet. In the meantime, the Schneiders' spirited daughter, Terka (Éva Fenyvessy), falls for their good-looking manager, the former driver István Benedek (Pál Jávor), who keeps secret that he is in fact an engineer with a college diploma. Her mother, however, would prefer the good-natured, but quite stupid Makáts (Gyula Gózon) as a suitor, because Makáts's uncle (Sándor Góth), a city councillor, may help them to get a lucrative contract. Things begin to turn upside down, when Schneider follows Hyppolit's suggestions to start dating Mimi (Mici Erdélyi), a singer and dancer at a sleazy night club. When he fails to show up at a date with her, the girl enters the Schneiders' villa, where a dinner party with important guests - including Makáts's uncle - is taking place, and causes a scandal. Meanwhile, Terka follows her own plans to get the man she wants... Subsequent history The film was shown again in Hungarian cinemas in 1945, 1956 and 1972.According to the booklet of the DVD edition of the restored version (2008). It is also shown regularly on the small screen and is still popular with viewers. Almost eighty years after its premiere, in 2008, the original film was digitally restored by the Hungarian National Film Archive.

It is the smallest of the three rivers joining the Euphrates in Syria, and the only one that joins the Euphrates on its right bank. Occupation in the Sājūr basin started in the Lower Palaeolithic period and continues until today. Course The Sājūr River is long, of which in Turkey and in Syria. It is fed by two streams which join south of Gaziantep. From there, the Sājūr flows southeast until it crosses the Syria–Turkey border. The river then continues in a roughly easterly direction until it joins the Euphrates on its right bank in the area that is flooded by the Tishrin Dam reservoir. In Syria, the river cuts a valley into the Manbij Plain that is between below the level of the plain, and up to wide. Average discharge is per second. Maximum discharge, occurring in the months February and March, is per second, while minimum discharge, recorded for June–October, is per second. Average annual discharge is . Both in terms of length, as well as discharge, the Sājūr is the smallest of the three rivers that join the Euphrates on Syrian soil – the other two being the Balikh and the Khabur. The Sājūr is also the only river in Syria that enters the Euphrates on its right bank; both the Balikh and the Khabur flow into the Euphrates on the left bank. Drainage basin The Sājūr drains a total area of . The Syrian part of the Sājūr basin – the Manbij Plain – has been particularly well-studied. This area is bounded on the north by the Syro–Turkish border and extends as far south as Manbij. To the west, the Manbij Plain is bordered by basalt outcrops; probably the remains of a Pliocene volcano. In the southeast of the plain, limestone outcrops force the Euphrates into the gorge of Qara Quzaq. These outcrops reach a height of over the plain. Reaching heights of amsl in the north, west and south, the Manbij Plain slopes down to amsl toward the east. In the western part of the drainage basin, flat grounds with fertile red-brown soils can be found, and this area is suitable for agriculture. Toward the east and along the Sājūr, the plain is dissected by numerous wadis, making these parts of the area less suitable for human occupation and agriculture. The Manbij Plain experiences a continental climate. Average temperatures range from in January to in July. Annual average precipitation is , but ranges from a minimum of per year in dry years to per year in exceptionally wet years. Although much of the area is cultivated today, combined palaeobotanical, climate and vegetation research suggest that the basin would support a xeric woodland vegetation with open oak forest and Rosaceae (rose/plum family) in the absence of human activity. History Occupation of the Sājūr river basin started as early as the Lower Palaeolithic period, as evidenced by Acheulean stone artefacts. Middle Palaeolithic artefacts have been found as well. Economy Both Turkey and Syria use water from the Sājūr for irrigation purposes. Since the 19th century, occupation in and cultivation of the Sājūr basin have steadily increased, especially in the western, more fertile part of the area. The introduction of motorized pumps has led to a considerable decrease of the groundwater table, with the effect that many wells have dried up. Turkey has built the Kayacık Dam on the Ayfinar Deresi, one of the two streams that join to form the Sajur. This high dam creates a reservoir with a surface area of . From this reservoir, an area of is irrigated. A dam with a planned reservoir capacity of is under construction on the Syrian part of the Sajour.

She has also been a candidate for public office. Her scholarly work on Canadian literary theorist, Northrop Frye, has focused on the social function of literature and the role that metaphorical language plays in process poetics. She has written and presented on the links between process theology and process poetics. Cotrupi's book, Northrop Frye and The Poetics of Process, was the first major work to explore how Longinian poetics, the theories of Giambattista Vico, and process thinking influenced Frye's writing. Taking her cue from Frye's notion that cultural and literary works function as the laboratory for fashioning new and hopefully, better worlds, she explores the notion that some literature does indeed function as a secular scripture, carving out a path for individual and collective moral acts. In 2002 she delivered the keynote address to the Northrop Frye Festival titled \\"Process and Possibility: Northrop Frye’s Spiritual Vision\\". Cotrupi was a candidate for political office in the riding of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, during one provincial election and one federal election. Called to the Ontario bar in 1980, she practiced law in a Toronto legal clinic providing services to low income and immigrant groups in the 1980s and later, in the 1990s with a Toronto law firm specializing in not-for-profit and charity law. During this time she served on the board of A-Way, a Toronto-based company founded and staffed by individuals who had experienced mental health challenges. Throughout the period of her legal practice, and more currently during her business involvements in the field of continuing professional and legal education, Nella Cotrupi has continued to teach and make presentations on subjects associated with literature and the social and moral processes literature fuels.

The park just north of Durant, Florida was the site of phosphate mining in the 1960s by the American Cyanamid Company, before the land was donated (largely in 1969). A dike and reservoir were created in 1970 to provide flood protection along the Alafia River. The lake has a very extensive and irregular shoreline, and great variation is found in the lake bottom as well. The park is maintained by the Hillsborough County Parks and Recreation Department, and has camping, picknicking, and other facilities. Three long piers offer the ability to launch fairly large vessels, although the lake has a no-wake restriction. Additional opportunities for various sports and aquatic activities are available at the popular spot which attracts approximately 250,000 visitors a year.Edward Medard Park and Preserve Southwest Florida Water Management District Reconstruction and restocking In the early 2000s, the Alafia Basin Board determined that the aging dam was a threat to downstream residents. The lake was almost completely drained in 2010 and closed to fishing for three years due to reconstruction work designed to strengthen the dam and decrease erosion, as well as to add additional amenities including a new boardwalk and a new dock. After the lake was drained, at the urging of state senator Ronda Storms, the tons of tilapia and catfish removed from the reservoir were filleted and distributed to America's Second Harvest, which provided the fillets to local charities to feed the hungry. When the lake reopened in December 2012, it was designated a Fisheries Management Area (FMA) by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), with special limits on the number and size of fish that could be taken, and with commercial fishing of tilapia, sailfin catfish, and armored catfish limited to Tuesday through Thursday. During the construction process, several artificial reefs were installed. During this time, the lake was stocked with 1.2 million fingerling sportsfish, including a quarter-million Florida-strain largemouth bass, plus an additional 6,600 large fish that were relocated from area lakes in 2012. Features The park also features a 40 feet tall observation tower overlooking the lake from the Northeast, 42 campsites, and a disc golf course. The park contains several trails, including both hiking and equestrian trails. Horses may be rented at the adjacent Turkey Creek Stables. The park levies a $2.00 per vehicle entrance fee, a $5.00 boat launch fee, and a $25.00 canoe/kayak rental fee, with additional fees for camping. Vegetation Floating leaf aquatic plants include American Lotus, Water Lettuce, Marsh pennywort, Water spangles, Common Duckweed, Giant Duckweed, and Water Hyacinth. A wide variety of emergent zone plants thrive here, including Wild Taro, Egyptian Paspalidium (watercrown grass), Laurel oak, Muscadine grape, Peruvian Primrose Willow, cattails and many more.

A passenger train travelling from Oran to the capital Algiers and consisting of a locomotive and eight carriages stalled on a steep gradient leading to a mountain pass a few kilometres beyond the town of Bouhalouane in the Chlef Province of Algeria. The locomotive was uncoupled leaving the carriages unsecured; the brakes failed on the carriages and they rolled back down the slope to Bouhalouane where they collided with a freight train in the station.

The passenger carriages were split open and stacked upon each other; screams of the wounded could be heard. Motorists passing the station were stopped and their cars became makeshift ambulances taking the injured to nearby hospitals. Heavy lifting equipment and cutting torches were used as police and army worked to rescue the injured, illuminated by spotlights. By dawn 100 bodies had been recovered.

Early years Jordan was born in Los Angeles, California, USA. His parents are Charles Jordan, Sr. and Roxie Jordan. Retired NFL wide receiver Curtis Conway is his cousin. In addition to playing football at Morningside High School in Inglewood, California, he was a wrestler and a track star. Jordan set a CIF Southern Section 2-A State track record in the 200-meters at 21:59 in 1987, the year he graduated. He planned on playing college football at the University of Utah but felt the student/athlete challenge wasn't a good match, so he enrolled at Long Beach City College in Long Beach, California. Surgery put him on the injured reserve list, and with LBCC running an option offense that didn't match Jordan's talents, he left the program in 1988 with fellow Morningside wide receiver Alex Williams. Jordan became a member of the Family Swans, a Bloods set. He was shot four times, and he spent time in county jail. At one point, he was charged with murder, though the charges were later dismissed. Jordan also worked as a cook at Little Rascals, his uncle's soul food restaurant in South Central Los Angeles, and assisted at his aunt's beauty salon. Eventually, Jordan decided to return to college and play out his eligibility. Career Invited to the Los Angeles Raiders' mini-camp for draft choices in 1993, he made the team, though he didn't play a single game for the Raiders that season. In 1994 and 1995, he played for the Green Bay Packers. In 1996, he was signed by the Miami Dolphins as a restricted free agent, receiving a three- year, $2.6 million contract. Coach Jimmy Johnson cut Jordan in the last of the three seasons following a November 1998 arrest after a nightclub fight that included charges of trespassing, battery on a law enforcement officer, and resisting arrest with and without violence. In his final NFL season, 1999,.he first played for the Seattle Seahawks and then returned to Green Bay. In 2001, he joined the Memphis Maniax, an XFL team.

With a focus on daily choices, Otesha strives to make clear the connection between individuals and large-scale global issues, and to positively impact communities and the planet. All of Otesha's programs are a part of their broad vision to bring sustainable consumption in the mainstream of Canadian culture. Using a variety of programs, including theatre, workshops, cycling tours, and written word, The Otesha Project has engaged over 150,000 Canadians and has trained over 500 sustainability advocates since 2002. The Otesha Project is defunct as of December 31, 2015. History The Otesha Project was founded in 2002 by Jocelyn Land-Murphy and Jessica Lax. During time spent studying sustainable development in Kenya, the two women were struck by the disparity that they witnessed between the lifestyles that many enjoy in North America, and the lifestyles of many Kenyans. Particularly, they were disturbed by the relative excess of wealth and consumption among North Americans, and were inspired to do something about it. Their dream of a world without such stark inequality became manifest as The Otesha Project – “otesha” is a Swahili word which translates as “reason to dream”. From the beginning, The Otesha Project took a grassroots approach to addressing environmental and social sustainability, focusing on the potential for individual choices to impact the planet. Their vision for a movement became reality in October 2003, when they launched the first, coast-to-coast Otesha bicycle tour. During this tour, over 250 presentations were delivered to over 12,000 people. Since this first tour, the organization and the movement has continued to grow. Since 2002, The Otesha Project has connected with over 150,000 Canadians through creative and energizing performances, workshops, and keynote presentations, and trained over 500 sustainability advocates through their unique cycling tour program. The organization announced that, as of December 31, 2015, it was shutting down because it was no longer financially sustainable. Programs =Presentations= The Otesha Project uses a variety of tools to put together presentations that share with their audiences the ways in which individual choices can make a difference, both environmentally and socially. These tools include theatre, multi-media, storytelling, motivational speaking, games, facilitation tools and workshops. Otesha facilitators take up to 30 participants through energizing activities that bring fresh information to the table, generate discussion, and allow participants to use their own experience to problem-solve. Otesha presentations are positive, humorous, informative, and accessible to everyone, and allow participants to move from exploration to action in 30–60 minutes. =Bicycle Tours= Every year, The Otesha Project runs several bicycle tours throughout Canada, each of which takes their message of environmental sustainability on the road. Tours range in length from 9 days to 2 months and typically have between 12 and 18 tour members. The goal of Otesha tours is to spread the message to as many individuals and communities as possible, while tour members live by the terms of their own community mandate. This means that groups continually strive to live as sustainably as possible while on tour. Tour life is largely self-directed; decisions are made by consensus. Each tour member plays a role in determining what types of food the group will and will not eat, how they will limit their water consumption, etc. As with the presentations, Otesha's bicycle tours are meant to be accessible to everyone, regardless of individual levels of cycling experience. In order to cover some of the costs associated with participating in an Otesha bike tour, members are responsible for fundraising. Tour costs range from $925.00 to $2350.00, depending on tour length. The Otesha Project supports all tour members by providing them with a variety of fundraising ideas and resources to use as a starting point. In addition, bursaries are available to riders that are unable to reach the fundraising goal, or unable to cover the cost of equipment required for the tour. =Triple H Program= In addition to the bicycle tours, The Otesha Project also regularly put on presentations as a part of their Hopeful High school Hooligan (Triple-H) program. This is a program that is meant to involve high school students in sharing Otesha's message of environmental sustainability. This project brings together teams of 10-15 high school students to learn, and present, The Otesha 'Choices' play to their own schools. Through this program, 'Choices' has been presented to over 9,000 high school students. =The Otesha Book= The Otesha Book: From Junk to Funk provides an in-depth look at the many ways that individual actions can impact the world. Representing the collaboration of over a dozen authors, The Otesha Book is divided into six issue areas: Water, Clothing, Media, Coffee, Food, and Transportation. Within each chapter there are four sub-sections: Removing the Blinders, which is about identifying the problems in many common North American lifestyles; Holding up the Mirror, which is about identifying the ways in which we all do, or don't, contribute to these problems; Empowerment, which is about recognizing the potential that all individuals have to make lessen their impact on the planet; and Action, which is about fulfilling one's potential to lessen their impact. These four subcategories provide the lens through which each chapter's focus area is examined. As a key resource for anyone interested in creating positive change – educators, parents, students, and concerned citizens alike - The Otesha Book can be ordered with a Teacher's Insert that allows teachers, workshop facilitators, and students themselves to easily construct lesson plans and workshops according to curriculum requirements and/or individual interests. Paperback copies of The Otesha Book are printed by Warren’s Waterless, a Toronto-based printer that uses non-toxic vegetable-based inks and a revolutionary waterless printing process. The paper is recycled (100% post-consumer waste), chlorine-free, and produced by a mill powered with bio-gas from a nearby landfill. Hand-bound copies are also available, and The Otesha Project strives to make their book a very embodiment of their vision for sustainability by encouraging all those interested in the book to make their own covers from reused materials. =International Chapters= The Otesha Project has also inspired sister organizations across the globe, including Otesha UK, O.P.E.N. (Otesha Pan European Network), and Otesha (Australia). Each organization offers cycling tours, workshops, experiential learning and training for youth to become sustainability advocates. The UK organisation used interns to promote imports to the UK from countries that had no comparable social insurance system, and so contributed to the high unemployment of garment workers in the Tower Hamlets area where Otesha shared a subsidised office with similar organisations that have also since closed. \\"Like often criticised unpaid internships\\", that Otesha managed for PR to promote imported products \\"unintentionally reinforcing the same social divides we were trying to undo – increasing division between people who had the privilege to do these things, and those who didn’t.\\" None of the clothing and fair trade related organisations advocated social insurance systems in Africa, India or the far east. The group of related organisations (Ethical Fashion bloggers, Ethical Fashion Forum, Pants to Poverty) lost their subsidised office space about the same time, after a political change in Tower Hamlets, and most then closed.

Early history The original fortress, known as Gyel-khar-tse was attributed to Pelkhor-tsen, son of the anti-Buddhist king Langdharma, who probably reigned from 838 to 841 CE. The present walls were supposedly built in 1268, after the rise in power of the Sakyapa sect. A large palace was built in 1365 by a local prince, Phakpa Pelzangpo (1318–1370), who had found favour campaigning for the Sakyapas in the south. He also brought a famous Buddhist teacher, Buton Rinchendrub of Zhalu, to live in a temple there. Later in the 14th century Phakpa Pelzangpo's son, Kungpa Phakpa (1357–1412), she expanded the Gyantse complex and moved the royal residence here from the palace and fort her father had built at the entrance to the Gyantse valley. she also built Samphel Rinchenling, the first hilltop temple, beside the castle. Although the walls are mostly ruined, they still contain some 14th-century murals in Newari style as well as in the Gyantse style which grew from it.Dorje (2009), p. 308. British invasion, 1903–1904 Gyantse is often referred to by the Chinese as the \\"Hero City\\" because of the determined resistance of the Tibetans against far superior forces during the British expedition to Tibet of 1903 and 1904. There was a slow but bloody advance from Sikkim and a massacre of several hundred Tibetan troops equipped with antiquated \\"matchlock guns, swords, spears and slingshots\\"French (1994), p. 212. at the crude fortifications they had built below the village of Guru and at nearby Chumik Shenko (or Chumi Shengo), with the Tibetans facing far more deadly weapons including Maxim machine guns and BL 10-pounder mountain gun for the first time.Allen (2004), pp. 120–122.French (1994), p. 226. The British then pushed on to Gyantse which they reached after a couple more unequal skirmishes, on 12 April 1904. As most of the defenders had fled, the British took the Dzong, raised the Union Jack, but considering it difficult to defend, they retired to an aristocrat's compound about a mile south near the Nyang River at Changlo. About a week later General Macdonald withdrew down the Chumbi Valley to secure supply lines, leaving Younghusband with about 500 men who began pillaging neighbouring monasteries and villages.French (1994), pp. 227–230. Before dawn on 5 May hundreds of Tibetans attacked the camp at Changlo and, for a while, held the advantage before being overcome by the superior weapons and losing at least 200 men. On 7 May a small detachment of infantry arrived from General Macdonald who had been ambushed by the Tibetans at the Karo Pass, nearly east of Gyantse, where four of their men had been killed and thirteen badly wounded.French (1994), p. 231. A few days later the camp at Changlo came under siege as the Tibetan \\"troops had gained control of surrounding villages, and taken to firing miniature lead and copper cannon-balls into the camp from Gyantse Dzong.\\"French (1994), p. 232. There were even rumours that the Khory Buryat Gelug priest Agvan Dorzhiev, born not far from Ulan-Ude, east of Lake Baikal,Red Star Travel Guide , then under Russian control, was in charge of the Lhasa arsenal or even directing operations at Gyantse.French (1994), p. 233. He had become one of the 13th Dalai Lama's teachers and was suspected by the British of being a Russian agent.French (1994), p. 188. After a flurry of communications between Younghusband and the British authorities in India, Younghusband was temporarily recalled to the Chumbi Valley. Younghusband returned with more than a hundred mounted soldiers, more than two thousand infantry, eight big guns, two thousand coolies and four thousand yaks and mules. They arrived on the 28th of June and raised the siege of Changlo. Attempts to negotiate a settlement failed, with the Tibetans not responding to threats from Younghusband.French (1994), pp. 235–237. Also on 28 June, the nearby \\"seemingly impregnable\\" Tsechen Monastery and Dzong was stormed shortly before sunset, after a heavy bombardment by the British ten-pound cannon. Brigadier-General Macdonald, who had just arrived that day, concluded that Tsechen, which guarded the rear of the Gyantse Dzong, would have to be cleared before the assault could begin.Allen (2004), p. 207. An assault was therefore made on the Gyantse fortress on 5 July and, the following day, after a spirited defence by the Tibetans which lasted until sometime after 2 pm, a heavy artillery bombardment blew a hole in the wall followed by a direct hit on the powder magazine, causing a large explosion after which some Gurkha and British troops manage to climb the rock face, scramble inside, and take the fort in spite of a heavy hail of boulders and stones thrown down upon them by the few defenders left on what remained of the walls.Allen (2004), pp. 214–220.French (1994), pp. 236–237. John Duncan Grant was awarded the Victoria Cross and Havildar Karbir Pun was awarded the Indian Order of Merit for their joint actions along with other members of the 8th Gurkha Rifles on July 6. The victory was followed by widespread and sanctioned looting and plundering the dzong and nearby monasteries by the British troops. The \\"sanctioned plundering was subsequently hushed up\\".Allen (2004), pp. 227–228. The dead Tibetan defenders were \\"lying in heaps,\\" and it took a major effort using prisoners to drag all the bodies away. For several days the sappers were kept busy blowing up what remained of the defences at Gyantse, Tsechen and other places and finding hidden stores. Between Gyantse and Tsechen: \\"Our way was strewn with corpses. The warriors from the Kham country, who formed a large part of the Tibetan army, were glorious in death, long-haired giants, lying as they fell with their crude weapons lying beside them, and usually with a peaceful, patient look on their faces.\\" The way was now open to Lhasa. The troops began the march to the capital on 14 July.Allen (2004), PP. 228–229. Since the arrival of the Chinese The walls were dynamited again by the Chinese in 1967 during the Cultural Revolution, but little more seems to have been recorded about this turbulent period. However, the dzong has gradually been restored, and \\"still dominates the town and surrounding plains as it always did.\\" There is now a small museum there outlining the excesses of the Younghusband expedition from the Chinese perspective.Dorje (2009), pp. 5, 308, 312.

FXCM allows people to speculate on the foreign exchange market and provides trading in contract for difference (CFDs) on major indices and commodities such as gold and crude oil. It is based in London. The company was banned from United States markets for defrauding its customers. Its former parent company, Global Brokerage, Inc. filed for bankruptcy on December 11, 2017. The operating company, known as FXCM Group, is now owned by Jefferies Financial Group, which changed its name from Leucadia National Corporation in 2018. Global Brokerage shareholders lost over 98% of their investment since January 2015. On February 6, 2017, the firm agreed to pay a $7 million penalty to settle a suit from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) involving fraudulent misrepresentation by FXCM to its customers and to regulators. FXCM withdrew its CFTC registration and agreed not to re-register in the future, effectively banning it from trading in the United States. Three top managers resigned under regulatory pressure and the majority owner of the firm changed its name to Global Brokerage Inc., effective January 27, 2017. Global Brokerage filed for bankruptcy in November 2017, but officially reorganized in February 2018. While the company technically owns a 51% equity stake in FXCM Group, its agreement with Leucadia (now Jefferies Financial Group) and FXCM about future distributions of cash flows places its real economic interest in FXCM at 10 to 50%. Jefferies Financial Group remains the de facto parent company of the FXCM Group. A Managing Director of Jefferies Financial Group, which before the bankruptcy held a 49.9% equity stake in the operating company, was appointed chairman of the FXCM Group board. Its U.S. accounts were sold to Gain Capital. About 40,000 customer accounts were sold at about $375 each. History =1999–2008: Founding and Refco stake= Forex Capital Markets was founded in 1999 in New York, and was one of the early developers of and electronic trading platform for trading on the foreign exchange market. Initially, the firm was called Shalish Capital Markets, but after one year, rebranded as FXCM. In 2003, FXCM expanded overseas when it opened an office in London which became regulated by the UK Financial Services Authority. In January 2003, FXCM entered into a partnership with Refco group, one of the largest US futures brokers at the time. Refco took a 35% stake in FXCM and licensed the FXCM software for use by its own clients. Refco filed for bankruptcy on October 17, 2005, a week after a $430 million fraud was discovered, and two months after its initial public offering. Refco's CEO Phillip R. Bennett was later convicted of the fraud. In November 2005, Refco agreed, in part, to sell its 35% stake back (which included 15,000 customer accounts) to FXCM for $110 million. In March 2006, however, Refco's creditors disallowed the deal and, later, denied a separate $130 million bid by FXCM. Refco's stake in FXCM was eventually sold to a consortium of buyers, including Lehman Brothers Holdings. =2009–2014: Legal issues and initial public offering= In May 2010, FXCM, Inc. purchased the UK-based, ODL Group. FXCM had previously acquired ODL's U.S. business in January 2009. The 2010 acquisition made FXCM the largest retail forex broker in the world with over 200,000 clients and assets of around $800 million. In December 2010, FXCM completed an initial public offering and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol, FXCM. Share prices started at $14 with 15,060,000 shares for a total share capital of $211 million. In its IPO prospectus, FXCM described its no dealing desk trade execution. In August 2011, the National Futures Association (NFA) issued a $2-million fine to FXCM for slippage malpractice. All clients affected by price slippage were compensated within 30 days as part of the terms of the NFA deal. In October of that year, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) ordered FXCM to pay $14.2 million in restitution to clients who had not been awarded positive slippage gains. The following year, in February and March 2011, several class actions lawsuits were filed against FXCM, alleging fraud and racketeering from deceptive and unfair trade practices, and misleading shareholders during the 2010 IPO. From 2005-January 2017, FXCM faced a total of 13 CFTC reparations cases, 17 NFA arbitration decisions, and 8 other regulatory actions in the U.S. In June 2012, FXCM purchased a controlling stake in Lucid Markets, a London-based automated trading group focused on currency trading. FXCM also entered into a deal with Credit Suisse to develop the FastMatch electronic communication network (ECN). In 2013, FXCM bought a $12-million note issued by Infinium Capital Management, a high-speed trader based in Chicago. FXCM later purchased five trading desks and some physical assets from Infinium in March 2014. In February 2014 the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) fined FXCM and FXCM Securities Ltd (\\"FXCM UK\\") £4 million for slippage violations and for failing to inform the FCA of the CFTC investigation of the same practices. About £6 million was also paid in restitution to FXCM UK’s clients for a total of £10 million ($16.9 million) in fines. =2015–2017: Swiss franc jump and U.S. license loss= On January 15, 2015 following a large increase in the price of Swiss francs, FXCM lost $225 million and was in breach of regulatory capital requirements. The following day, the company received a $300-million bailout loan with a 10% interest rate from Leucadia in order to meet its capital requirements. Details of the deal showed that the interest rate could go as high as 17%. Later in January, FXCM announced that it would be forgiving 90% of its accounts that incurred negative balances as a result of the unexpected Swiss franc price movement. In September 2016, Leucadia extended the original two-year loan by one year. In February 2017, the CFTC fined FXCM, Inc. and three founding partners (including Drew Niv) $7 million for engaging in fraudulent activities. The CFTC found that the company's \\"no dealing desk\\" model (known as a direct market access system) routed trades through a market maker, Effex Capital, that was allegedly supported and controlled by FXCM. FXCM was then barred by the CFTC and the NFA as were the three founding partners. In response, FXCM, Inc. changed its name to Global Brokerage, Inc. and named Brendan Callan the interim CEO, replacing Drew Niv. The company also named Jimmy Hallac, a managing director at Leucadia, the chairman. All 40,000 of FXCM's U.S. accounts were sold to Gain Capital. Global Brokerage, Inc. remained listed on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol, \\"GLBR.\\" In May 2017, Global Brokerage was notified by NASDAQ that the market value of its stocks were not sufficient for continued listing. In August of that year, FXCM sold its stake in the FastMatch ECN for $46.7 million and used that money to repay part of the Leucadia loan. At that point, FXCM still owed $66.8 million on the loan. In October 2017, the FXCM Group terminated a management agreement with Global Brokerage. The following month, FXCM clarified that, while Global Brokerage held a 50.1% equity interest in the company, it held a minority economic interest. Leucadia owned a 49.9% equity share with a 65% economic interest. =2017–present: Bankruptcy and ownership by Jefferies= Global Brokerage, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2017 and was delisted from NASDAQ in December 2017. Global Brokerage later reorganized out of bankruptcy in February 2018. At that time, however, Global Brokerage's real economic interest in the FXCM Group was between 10 and 50% depending on the amount of distributions FXCM makes. Also in February 2018, FXCM rebranded itself as \\"FXCM: A Leucadia Company\\". As of March 2018, FXCM remained the second-largest retail forex broker outside of Japan.

They disbanded before achieving commercial success. The Metromen rose out of the new wave period which was typified at the time by acts such as Joe Jackson, The Police, and Elvis Costello, all of whom were a large influence on the music and style of the band. The Metromen circa 1980 History In late 1979 singer-songwriter Tom Teeley teamed up with longtime collaborator Russ Velazquez to start writing pared-down songs for a new project, bassist Bill Teeley joined, and finally multi-instrumentalist- drummer-songwriter Bob Miller was brought in to replace the first drummer Bennet Gale, thus creating 'The Metromen'. Miller, Velazquez and Tom Teeley had worked together previously in 1975-1976 as part of a five-piece pop-fusion band Jester, which emulated the more complex musical acts of the day such as Gentle Giant, Frank Zappa, and Mahavishnu Orchestra. Little of the fusion roots carried over into the new project, but the Zappa-style humor was kept intact. Shortly after their formation, the band signed a recording contract with Genya Ravan, most well known for her late 60's band Ten Wheel Drive. Ravan was starting an independent record label called Polish Records [as in polish the car]. The label would feature other up-and-coming NYC-based new wave bands,Ravan-credited productions for Polish records as well as perennials such as Ronnie Spector who was also signed to the fledgling label. Recordings In mid 1980 The Metromen went into the studio, holing up at the famous Mediasound studios on West 57th St. under the engineering skills of Harvey Goldberg. After completion of the album, the band began performing and showcasing the material in the New York club scene. Polish Records failed to launch as a viable label as a result of the label not being able to secure distribution of its product, and by 1981, the band and Polish Records went their separate ways. Without a recording deal, the Metromen set about producing and recording in their own facility, a catalog of new material which was meant to secure another recording contract for the band. To date, none of these Metromen recordings or albums have ever had commercial release. Performances In August 1980, the Metromen debuted their act at the then newly opened Ritz ballroom on 11th St. in New York. The band surprised the crowd by presenting a self-directed 8-minute opening film The Metromen Take The Ritz which set the stage for their entrance to the Ritz stage as well as New York club scene. They continued building their reputation over the next year and a half as a tight band with a quirky take on pop and rock songwriting and powerful arrangements. The group built a strong following playing Mudd Club, Great Gildersleeves, Snafu and their mainstay, Trax, which is where they played their final show in December 1981. The Metromen reunited for a single performance in November 2007 at Maxwell's in Hoboken, NJ and were joined onstage by old friends Marshall Crenshaw, Glen Burtnik, and others. Aftermath As the band entered 1982, the interest and fanbase grew, but internal dissent and other musical ventures outside the band caused the band to dissolve by mid 1982. Ironically, The Metromen quickly found themselves working together on the Broadway stage in the summer of 1982 portraying various rock icons in Dick Clark's Rock and Roll, The first 5000 Years.New York Times review In the years that followed the breakup the Metromen members went on to various successes. Bill Teeley went on to collaborate with Marshall Crenshaw on the hit Whenever You're On My Mind Tom Teeley released a solo album produced by Neil Kernon and was released on A&M; Records Tales Of Glamour and Distress and went on to play alongside other artist such as Joe Jackson..Joe Jackson Archive Mr. Velazquez went on to become a successful session singer in New York, writing and singing the themes to many commercials and TV series such as Pokémon.

Major archaeological sites of this period include Nakbe, Uaxactun, Seibal, San Bartolo, Cival, and El Mirador]Civilization: Ritual and Power Before the Classic Perioddate=2011publisher=Routledgelocation=London}} Maya society underwent a series of profound transformations between c. 100 AD and 250 AD, which resulted in the cessation of monumental building at many Preclassic cities and the inferred collapse of their political and economic systems, often characterized as the \\"Preclassic Collapse.\\" History =Early Preclassic (2000 BC–1000 BC)= The roots of Maya civilization remain obscure, although broad parameters are increasingly well known. Paleo-environmental data indicate the presence of agriculturalists in the Maya lowlands by c. 3000 BC, although permanent agricultural settlements seem to have developed only gradually. Analysis of bones from early Maya grave sites indicate that, although maize had already become a major component of the diet (under 30% at Ceullo, Belize) by this time, fish, meat from game animals, and other hunted or gathered foods still made up a major component of the diet. Along with the gradual development of agriculture, basic forms of pottery began to appear, with simple designs and some slipped vessels. Around this time, the Olmec culture began to emerge in nearby Tabasco, granting the early Maya an important trading partner and beginning a period of prolonged contact that would have profound effects on Maya society. =Middle Preclassic (1000 BC–400 BC)= Southern Maya area sites By around the year 1000 BC, centuries of agricultural village life had begun to form the beginnings of a complex society: Prestige goods such as obsidian mirrors and jade mosaics began to appear, increasing the demand for more extensive trade. Canals and irrigation schemes demanding coordinated human effort began to appear with increasing complexity and scale. Gradually, villages began to include central plazas and earthen mounds, occasionally enhanced by masonry. For instance, the site of La Blanca featured a central mound more than seventy-five feet tall and contained a masonry fragment strongly resembling a head in the distinctive Olmec style. Carved stone stele also began to appear during this period, adorned with portraits of rulers but still devoid of writing. Warfare appears to have intensified during this period, as evidenced by advanced weaponry, rulers beginning to be portrayed as warriors, and the appearance of mass graves and decapitated skeletons. Beginning around 900 BC, the Pacific coastal region fell under the dominance of the La Blanca statelet, which collapsed around 600BC, to be replaced by a polity centered on the El Ujuxte site. Another early statelet was probably based at the site of Chalchuapa, a town with extensive earthen mounds arranged around several plazas. However, it was likely ruled by the first true Maya city-state, Kaminaljuyu. Lying within modern-day Guatemala City on the shores of Lake Miraflores, Kaminaljuyu developed a powerful government structure that organized massive irrigation campaigns and built numerous intricately carved stone monuments to its rulers. These monuments clearly depict war captives and often show the rulers holding weapons, indicating the Kaminaljuyu polity engaged in active warfare, dominating the Guatemalan highlands for centuries. Kaminaljuyu's main export was the essential resource obsidian, a beautiful volcanic glass that easily fractured into sharp edges, providing arrowheads, knives, and other weapons as well as prestige goods like mirrors. Although it is difficult to firmly identify the ethnicity of a people from meager archeological remains, it appears that during this period the Maya began a systematic northward expansion, occupying the Petén Basin where such cities as El Mirador, Tikal, Calakmul, and Tayasal would be built. The dominant site of these early colonists was Nakbe in the El Mirador basin, where the first attested Maya ballcourt and sacbeob (stone causeways) were built. The rulers of Nakbe constructed several stone platforms and erected intricately carved stone and stucco monuments. During this period, the Olmec culture reached its zenith, centered on the capital of La Venta in modern-day Tabasco near the early Maya centers. Speakers of a Mixe–Zoquean language, the Olmec are generally recognized as the first true civilization in the Americas. Their capital city of La Venta contains extensive earthworks and stone monuments, including several of the distinctive Olmec stone heads. The Olmec share several features with later Maya culture, including extensive jaguar-worship, a diet dominated by maize, and the use of the cacao plant. Several words entered Mayan from a Mixe–Zoquean language, presumably due to Olmec influence. Many of these borrowings relate to prestige concepts and high culture, indicating that the Middle Preclassic Maya were deeply impressed and influenced by their northwestern neighbors. =Late Preclassic (400 BC–100 AD)= The Late Preclassic saw the rise of two powerful states that rival later Classic Maya city-states for scale and monumental architecture, Kaminaljuyu in the highlands and El Mirador in the lowlands. =Terminal Preclassic (100 AD–250 AD)= The late or terminal Preclassic murals found in San Bartolo provide important information regarding mythology and royal inauguration ritual around 100 BC. =Preclassic Collapse= The story of the mysterious lost civilization that suddenly collapsed for an unknown reason has captured the popular imagination for well over a century. What is not as widely known is that there were two such \\"collapses\\", the first at the end of the Preclassic, and the more famous Classic Maya collapse. The \\"Preclassic collapse\\" refers to the systematic decline and abandoning of the major Preclassic cities such as El Mirador around 100 AD. A number of theories have been proposed to explain this collapse, but there is as little consensus here as there is for the causes of the more famous collapse leading to the Postclassic period. Culture =Social structure= The archaeological site of Kʼo, associated with the Classic Maya city of Holmul located in modern-day Guatemala, boasts what may be the royal tomb of the earliest known Mayan ruler.John Tomasic and Steven Bozarth (2011), New Data from a Preclassic Tomb at Kʼo, Guatemala. Kansas.academia.edu p9 This tomb has been dated to 350–300 BC, and it contains the earliest evidence of the institution of ajaw (ruler) in the Maya Lowlands. =Writing= =Art and architecture= Early Maya architecture is based on the general Mesoamerican architectural traditions. The stepped pyramids were constructed from the Terminal Pre-classic period onwards. In 2010, archaeologists at Chiapa de Corzo, southern Chiapas, Mexico, announced they have found a dignitary's tomb inside a pyramid that may be the oldest type of burial discovered in Mesoamerica. The grave dates from about 2,700 years ago.

He previously played for the San Diego Padres, St. Louis Cardinals, and Los Angeles Dodgers. Gyorko attended University High School in Morgantown, West Virginia. Playing for the school's baseball team as a shortstop, he was named one of the best baseball players in the state. He then enrolled at West Virginia University, and set numerous school records for the West Virginia Mountaineers baseball program. Gyorko won the 2010 Brooks Wallace Award as the best shortstop in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I. The Padres selected Gyorko in the second round of the 2010 MLB draft. Playing in minor league baseball, Gyorko shifted to third base, and developed into one of the best prospects in baseball. He made the Padres' Opening Day roster as their starting second baseman in 2013. The Padres signed Gyorko to a five-year contract extension worth $35 million early in the 2014 season, but traded him to St. Louis after the 2015 season. The Cardinals traded him to the Dodgers in 2019. On January 10th, 2020 he signed a 1 year contract with the Milwaukee Brewers with a Club Option for 2021. Early life Gyorko was born on September 23, 1988, in Morgantown, West Virginia, to Randall and Penny Gyorko. His family also had a home on Cheat Lake, where he stayed often in his youth. He was a fan of the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball (MLB). When he was five years old, his father, Randall, and Jerry Mahoney, a former college baseball player at West Virginia University (WVU) and WVU employee, began to train Gyorko to become a baseball player through various instructional drills. They trained at WVU's Shell Building, which Mahoney had access to, when the weather was too cold to train outdoors. In youth baseball, Gyorko played as a second baseman. Amateur career Gyorko attended University High School in Morgantown. He played for the school's baseball, American football, and basketball teams. He was an infielder for the baseball team, but primarily played shortstop. In baseball, Gyorko was named to the All-Conference team all four years of his high school career. He was also named to the All-State team three times. Gyorko also played American Legion baseball for four years. He led his American Legion teams to state championships in 2004 and 2007. Gyorko played quarterback and wide receiver for the football team, and shooting guard and point guard for the basketball team. In basketball, Gyorko was named All- Conference as a sophomore. University won the conference championship in Gyorko's junior year, as he averaged 17.4 points per game (PPG), second best in the conference. He was named his conference's Player of the Year and to the All-State second team. In his senior year, he averaged 18.2 PPG and was named to the All-State first team. After weighing scholarship offers to play college baseball from WVU, St. John's University and Clemson University, Gyorko chose to remain near home, enrolling at WVU in order to play college baseball for the West Virginia Mountaineers baseball team, which competed in the Big East Conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division I. Gyorko shifted to second base for his freshman year to accommodate senior Tyler Kuhn, who played shortstop. He had a 21-game hitting streak to start his tenure with the Mountaineers, registering a .500 batting average during the streak. As a freshman, Gyorko finished the season with a .409 batting average with eight home runs and 63 runs batted in (RBIs), winning the Big East Rookie of the Year Award. He was also named to the All-Big East's second team, and the Freshman All-America teams of Louisville Slugger and the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association. He agreed to play collegiate summer baseball for the Brewster Whitecaps of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) after the college season, but he required shoulder surgery and was unable to play. Following Kuhn's graduation, Gyorko returned to shortstop for the Mountaineers. In his sophomore season, Gyorko batted .421 with eight home runs and 58 RBIs. He set a Mountaineers single-season record with 28 doubles. He was named First Team All-Big East and Second Team All-American by Louisville Slugger. After the season, he joined the United States national collegiate baseball team, but did not make the final roster. He joined Brewster for the CCBL season, playing second base. He was named to the CCBL All-Star Team, and he competed in the home run derby, held at Fenway Park. Prior to Gyorko's junior season, in 2010, he was named the preseason Big East Player of the Year and a Third Team All-American by Baseball America. Continuing to play as a shortstop, Gyorko batted .381 with 19 home runs and 57 RBIs in his junior year. He won the 2010 Brooks Wallace Award as the best shortstop in NCAA Division I. By the end of his junior season, Gyorko established himself as the Mountaineers career leader in batting average (.404), doubles (73), extra-base hits (113) and the single-season leader in walks (43), doubles (28), extra- base hits (48), and total bases (192). He also tied the WVU records for career home runs (35) and single-season home runs (19). Gyorko was considered a potential first or second round pick in the MLB Draft following his junior year, Though he had one more year of eligibility remaining at West Virginia, Gyorko said \\"it has always been my dream to play professionally\\" and that he would \\"go and play for a living\\" after his junior year. Professional career =San Diego Padres= Minor leagues Gyorko with the Lake Elsinore Storm in 2011 Professional teams coveted Gyorko for his hitting ability, though they did not expect him to play shortstop at the professional level. Though his throwing arm was viewed as strong enough to allow him to play at any position in the infield, analysts believed that Gyorko would not have sufficient range or speed to play shortstop professionally, and Gyorko understood he would likely change positions. Regarding his defense, Gyorko said \\"where I play [on defense] isn't a big concern for me. I'm just ready for this chance to live a dream and it will all work out.\\" The San Diego Padres drafted Gyorko in the second round, with the 59th overall selection, of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft. They selected Gyorko as a third baseman. Gyorko signed with the Padres quickly, receiving a $614,700 signing bonus, while other draft selections held out for higher signing bonuses. After signing with the Padres, Gyorko was assigned to the Eugene Emeralds of the Class A Short Season Northwest League, where he hit .330 with five home runs, 18 RBIs, and 35 hits in 26 games. He was then promoted to the Fort Wayne TinCaps of the Class A Midwest League. He hit a home run in his first at-bat with the TinCaps. Gyorko batted .284 with 46 hits in 42 games. Gyorko began the 2011 season with the Lake Elsinore Storm of the Class A-Advanced California League. He split time between third base and designated hitter, as fellow third base prospect Edinson Rincon was also a member of the Storm. Gyorko appeared in the California/Carolina League All-Star Game, and was named the Top Star as he batted 2-for-4 with a run scored and one RBI. Gyorko batted .365 with 18 home runs and 74 RBIs for Lake Elsinore before he was promoted to the San Antonio Missions of the Double-A Texas League, following the promotion of Missions third baseman James Darnell. In 576 at-bats for Lake Elsinore and San Antonio, Gyorko had 192 hits, 25 home runs, 114 RBIs, a batting average of .333 and a .400 on-base percentage (OBP). Following the season, he competed in the Arizona Fall League. He was named the 10th best prospect in the AFL that year, after he led the league with a .437 batting average. Gyorko began the 2012 season with San Antonio, where he batted .262 with six home runs and 17 RBIs in 34 games. He was promoted to the Tucson Padres of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League (PCL) in mid-May, as the Padres promoted Everth Cabrera and Alexi Amarista from Tucson, released Orlando Hudson, and placed Jason Bartlett on the disabled list. He continued to split his time between second base and third base at each level after playing third in his previous minor league seasons. Baseball America ranked Gyorko as the 50th best prospect in their midseason ranking of prospects, after ranking him 98th coming into the 2012 season. With Tucson, Gyorko hit .328 with 24 home runs and 83 RBIs. He finished the season with a combined .311 batting average, .373 OBP, and .547 slugging percentage (SLG), with 30 home runs. In 410 plate appearances, he struck out only 68 times. Baseball America named Gyorko the best third baseman in Triple-A. San Diego Padres in 2013 2013 season The Padres invited him to spring training in 2013, giving him a chance to win a job as the starting second baseman for the 2013 Padres. Gyorko impressed Padres' manager Bud Black with his hitting ability and defense at second base. With injuries to infielders Chase Headley and Logan Forsythe, Gyorko made the Padres' Opening Day roster, with the opportunity to alternate between second and third base. In his MLB debut, on April 1, 2013, Gyorko started at second base, but later shifted to third base. He also recorded his first MLB hit, a double off of Jonathan Niese. He hit his first major league home run off of Scott Feldman of the Chicago Cubs on May 1, 2013. His six home runs in May tied Evan Gattis for the most among MLB rookies. Gyorko had a .280 batting average through June 10, and missed the next 30 games due to a groin injury. Gyorko batted .100 in July, but he improved his on-base percentage and on-base plus slugging in August, and passed Gattis with 16 home runs. He continued to swing at pitches outside of the strike zone and not draw enough walks. Gyorko finished the season as the team leader in both home runs (23) and RBIs (63). He led all MLB rookies that season in OBP (.301), SLG (.444), and home runs, and his home run total was the third-most ever by an MLB rookie second baseman. He broke the Padres' record for home runs by a second baseman, passing Bret Boone's 19 in 2000. Gyorko was also the first MLB rookie second baseman to lead his team in RBIs. Additionally, he became just the second rookie to lead the Padres in either category since Nate Colbert in San Diego's inaugural season in 1969. He was named to Baseball Americas All-Rookie Team, and finished sixth in NL Rookie of the Year balloting. 2014 season Going into spring training in 2014, Gyorko began focusing on improving his plate discipline, while maintaining his aggressiveness in swinging at hittable pitches. He also lost weight in an effort to improve his flexibility. Gyorko agreed to a $510,900 salary for the 2014 season. On April 14, Gyorko signed a five-year extension with the Padres worth $35 million, which was the third largest for a player with only one year of service in the majors. After committing four errors in his first 25 games, Gyorko increased his infield practice with Glenn Hoffman, the Padres' third base and infield coach. After struggling to start the season, with a .162 batting average, the Padres placed Gyorko on the 15-day disabled list on June 6 due to plantar fasciitis in his left foot. After missing 44 games, Gyorko was activated off the disabled list on July 28. With his 31st career home run on August 16, Gyorko succeeded Mark Loretta for most home runs as a Padres' second baseman. He batted .260 in his final 222 plate appearances of the year, but ended the season with disappointing numbers: a .210 batting average, .280 OBP, .333 SLG, and ten home runs. 2015 season Gyorko (left) and a sliding Bryce Harper, 2015 During the 2014–15 offseason, Gyorko worked to regain the muscle he lost during the previous offseason. With Matt Kemp and Justin Upton added to the Padres' lineup, Black hoped to reduce the pressure on Gyorko to perform. By late April, with Gyorko off to a 7-for-47 (.147) start to the season, he began to lose playing time to Yangervis Solarte, and to Cory Spangenberg in May and June as he continued to struggle. On June 10, after hitting .210 with two home runs in 46 games, the Padres demoted Gyorko to the El Paso Chihuahuas of the PCL. Gyorko hit .279 with four home runs in 16 games, before the Padres recalled him on June 30. Gyorko made his first appearance at shortstop as a professional on August 17, and continued to play shortstop throughout the remainder of the season. Gyorko finished the season with a .247 batting average and 16 home runs in 128 games. =St. Louis Cardinals= Gyorko playing third base in 2017. On December 8, 2015, the Padres traded Gyorko to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for Jon Jay, while also agreeing to pay $7.5 million towards the remaining $33 million guaranteed by Gyorko's contract. The Cardinals intended to use Gyorko as a backup for second baseman Kolten Wong, third baseman Matt Carpenter, and shortstop Jhonny Peralta. He opened the season as the Cardinals' starting shortstop due to an injury to Peralta. While playing the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 5, he hit his first home run for the Cardinals. Due to the emergence of Aledmys Díaz at shortstop and Wong's struggles, Gyorko received most of his playing time at second base. In his first five games against the Padres, Gyorko homered in each game, totaling six, and also had 13 hits in 21 at bats with 10 RBIs. He reached 30 home runs for the first time on October 1, 2016, against the Pittsburgh Pirates, also a game-winning hit. In 2017, the Cardinals shifted Carpenter to first base, with Peralta and Gyorko playing third base. Gyorko became the Cardinals' regular third baseman after the Cardinals designated Peralta. Gyorko hit 13 home runs in the first half of the season, but only six after the All-Star break. He finished the year batting .272 with twenty home runs and 67 RBIs in 125 games. Despite two stints on the disabled list in 2018, Gyorko still appeared in 125 games, hitting .262 with 11 home runs and 47 RBIs. Gyorko returned to a utility role in 2019 after the Cardinals acquired Paul Goldschmidt. He played in 38 games for the Cardinals in 2019, batting .194 with two home runs and seven RBIs, before going on the injured list with a strained back. His rehabilitation was complicated by calf and wrist injuries. =Los Angeles Dodgers= On July 31, 2019, the Cardinals traded Gyorko to the Los Angeles Dodgers along with international signing bonus space and cash considerations in exchange for Tony Cingrani and minor leaguer Jeffry Abreu. He began a rehabilitation assignment with the Tulsa Drillers of the Texas League on August 3.https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2019-08-01/joc-pederson-first- base-experiment-ends-dodgers Gyorko debuted with the Dodgers on August 18 against the Atlanta Braves, playing first base and going two for four at the plate. He appeared in 24 games for the Dodgers, with five hits in 36 at-bats (.139). In 2019, he had the slowest sprint speed of all major league third basemen, at 23.8 feet/second. The Dodgers declined Gyorko's contract option following the 2019 season, making him a free agent. =Milwaukee Brewers= On January 10, 2020, Gyorko signed a contract with the Milwaukee Brewers, with a club option for 2021. Personal life Gyorko is the youngest of three sons. His older brother, Scott, attended WVU and played college football for the West Virginia Mountaineers football team as a linebacker. Jedd attends all Mountaineers football games. Gyorko used the money he received in his signing bonus to build a house in Morgantown near his parents' house. Gyorko intends on finishing his bachelor's degree in business. Gyorko married his wife Karley in 2011. While he played with the Padres, the couple lived within walking distance of Petco Park, the home stadium of the Padres, during the season, and returned to Morgantown during the offseason. Karley gave birth to twin sons in April 2014. They were born premature, and one remained in the hospital for a few extra days for observation. The couple's third child, a daughter, was born in May 2017.

Ford, a number eight, was born in Sheffield, Tasmania and claimed a total of 11 international rugby caps for Australia. His brother Eric was also an Australian rugby union representative player.  Family and early life  One of three children, his publican father died when Jack was aged four and the family moved from Tasmania to Sydney. Together with his brothers Eric and Percy, Jack Ford became a boarder at St Joseph's CollegeHowell pp226 where he learned his rugby under the guidance of the legendary Brother Henry. He was a good student and won a College bursary which allowed him to attend College for a total of eight years. He was an outstanding cricketer and boxer while at school and matured to an ideal physique for all these sports.  Rugby career  After leaving school, he joined the Glebe-Balmain Club with his brothers. At 20 he made his debut for NSW against New Zealand and made an immediate impression with his explosive running, which led to his selection in the 1927–28 Waratahs tour of the British Isles, France and Canada. On that tour, among a veritable firmament of rugby stars, Ford stood out for his great vision, which identified opposition weaknesses. When the Waratahs were within striking distance, canny captain Johnnie Wallace, Ford's team-mate at Glebe-Balmain, invariably pulled Jack Ford out of the pack to play at second five-eighth. With his flashing speed, immense strength and sheer size (he was by far the biggest man in the Waratah team), he was virtually unstoppable and scored twelve tries from this tactic in twenty-four matches on tour as well as setting up many more for others to score after he had made the break. Jack Ford's career continued in 1929 when he played for the first Australian team to win all internationals against New Zealand. In a great Australian pack, his was the stroke of genius and he scored tries in each of the final two Tests with his pace, strength and uncanny ability to read the game. He retired in 1930, a winner in eight of his last nine Tests after Australia's win over the 1930 British Lions. He had played in addition to all his representative games, a total of 65 games for Glebe-Balmain and Drummoyne. The Welsh Rugby Union sent him a set of scarlet red jumpers to mark the change in the Club name from Glebe-Balmain to Drummoyne and the Club still plays in those scarlet colours to this day.  Recognition  In 1999, for the 125th Anniversary Celebration of the foundation of the New South Wales Rugby Union in the Southern Hemisphere, a panel of experts was asked to select the best XV that had ever appeared for New South Wales and Australia. Without exception, Jack Ford's name came up as the greatest ever number eight. He was inducted into the Australian Rugby Hall of Fame in 2016.

Australian official war artists are those who have been expressly employed by either the Australian War Memorial (AWM) or the Army Military History Section (or its antecedents). These artist soldiers depicted some aspect of war through art; this might be a pictorial record or it might commemorate how war shapes lives.Imperial War Museum (IWM), About the Imperial War Museum War artists have explored a visual and sensory dimension of war which is often absent in written histories or other accounts of warfare. Official war artists have been appointed by governments for information or propaganda purposes and to record events on the battlefield;National Archives (UK), \\"'The Art of War,' Learn About the Art.\\" but there are many other types of war artist. A war artist creates a visual account of war by showing its impact as men and women are shown waiting, preparing, fighting, suffering, celebrating,Canadian War Museum (CWM), \\"Australia, Britain and Canada in the Second World War,\\" 2005. The works produced by war artists illustrate and record many aspects of war, and the individual's experience of war, whether allied or enemy, service or civilian, military or political, social or cultural. The rôle of the artist and his work embraces the causes, course and consequences of conflict and it has an essentially educational purpose. For example, C.E.W. Bean's Anzac Book influenced the artists who grew up between the two world wars; and the war art of their childhoods provided a precedent and format for them to follow as war artists of the Second World War.Reid, John B. (1977). Australian Artists at War, Vol. 2, p. 5. The AWM have appointed war artists to record the activities of Australian forces in Korea, Vietnam, East Timor and Afghanistan; and both the AWM and the Australian Army have appointed official war artists to depict Australian forces in Iraq. First World War Artworks by Arthur Streeton and sculptures by Web Gilbert on display at the Australian War Memorial in 2012 The Australian tradition of war artists started with the First World War. Will Dyson, an expatriate Australian artist living in London petitioned the Australian government to allow him to travel to the Western Front where Australian forces were fighting. In 1917 he was finally granted permission to accompany the Australian Imperial Force to record the activities of its soldiers and thus became the first Australian official war artist. This early scheme was expanded upon and other Australian artists were commissioned to undertake forays to the front lines to record the Australian experience of war. Artists who had already enlisted and were fighting with the AIF, were appointed official war artists for the Australian Army. Second World War During the Second World War, the Australian War Memorial, continued the scheme and appointed war artists whilst the Australian Army, Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force appointed their own official war artists from within their ranks. Other venues have honored Australian participation in the war.CWM, \\"Interpreting the war: Australia's Second World War art\\" by Lola Wilkins, 2005.

Robusta is mainly used for regular coffee as well as a typical coffee drink in Laos where it is sweetened with condensed milk. The latter, Arabica, is of a higher quality due to its mild taste, and it is used for espresso. For the 20,000 tons of coffee that Laos produces a year, 5,000 tons are Arabica beans and 15,000 tons are Robusta.  Laotian coffee  The Arabica beans produced in Laos “are known for their medium body and a combination of mild citrus and floral tones.” Laos produces Robusta coffee at high altitudes (1300 m.a.s.l.) unlike other countries. 95% of its coffee is harvested in the Bolaven Plateau. Coffee is Laos’ fifth largest export product. The Bolaven Plateau, where coffee was first planted in Laos during the French colonial times, is the primary region of production for Laos. Several species were planted including Arabica, Robusta, and Liberica. While Laos is one of the few countries in the world able to boast about its high quality coffee beans, production serves as much more than a simple bragging right. The coffee industry proves to be vital to Laos' economy and its standard of living. Most farmers in Laos would be earning a significantly lower income if they were to produce common crops such as soy, rice, corn, etc. However, coffee production allows them to earn a salary that is sufficient to educate their families. Coffee also serves as Laos' main export commodity. Laos' abundant farmers, land resources and suitable climate make for a high probability of producing Arabica coffee in large quantities.  History of coffee production in Laos  The first few coffee plants were introduced to the country and soils of Laos by French colonists around 1915. After trial and error of trying to harvest coffee beans in the north, the French realized that southern Laos was ideal for plantations. Millions of years ago there was a volcanic eruption in the south, causing the southern soils to contain rich minerals ideal for coffee production. The south is also where the Bolaven Plateau is, which remains as Laos’ primary region of production. The Bolaven Plateau is located in the area known as Paksong, where vegetation is verdant all year around. Not only does its rich soil serve as the reason for ideal coffee production, but so does its high altitude of 800 to 1350 meters and cool climate. For the past twenty years and continuing, the government of Laos has been working with coffee harvesters to plant more Arabica plants, since it yields a higher price, thus, increasing the income of farmers. There are 20,000 coffee growing communities in 250 villages in Laos and many of these families depend on coffee farming as a living.

Early life Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on 11 April 1921, John Laboon attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology for one year after high school. In 1939, he entered the United States Naval Academy, where he excelled in both athletics and academics. In 1942, he was a member of the All-East Football Team, and in 1943, \\"jumped ship\\" to college lacrosse, where he was selected for the Intercollegiate National Championship Navy Lacrosse Team, defenseman on the All-American Lacrosse Squad, and participated in the North-South All-Star game. He also served as president of the Newman Club, a Catholic campus ministry group. World War II After accelerated graduation in 1943, he trained as a submarine officer at New London, Connecticut, and upon completion, was assigned to USS Peto (SS-265). During his tour, Laboon served as Communications Officer, Gunnery and Torpedo Officer, and Executive Officer. Lieutenant Junior Grade Laboon was awarded the Silver Star for his heroic actions on Peto's tenth war patrol. Following pick- up of a downed American pilot near Honshū, the crew searched for his wingman. The second aviator was soon spotted, but the water was shallow and mined, preventing Peto from maneuvering closer. To make matters worse, they were under intense enemy fire from a Japanese shore battery. The submarine's commanding officer called for a volunteer, and without hesitation, LTJG Laboon dove off the submarine. Swimming through the mined waters, he rescued the pilot. Priesthood Lieutenant Laboon resigned from naval service shortly after the end of World War II, and entered the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) on 31 October 1946. On 17 July 1956, Father Jake was ordained a Jesuit priest at Woodstock, Maryland. Father Laboon then applied for a commission in the U.S. Naval Reserve Chaplain Corps in February 1957, and in December 1958 was recalled to active duty. Over the course of the next 22 years, \\"Father Jake\\" served in various duty stations around the world, including Alaska, Hawaii, Japan, and Vietnam. While in Vietnam, he was awarded the Legion of Merit with Combat \\"V\\" for his fearless actions as battlefield Chaplain with the 3rd Marine Division in April 1969. Other notable milestones in a distinguished career, include the honor of nomination for promotion to the rank of admiral and service as chief of chaplains. The Polaris submarine program was also blessed with having Father Jake as its first chaplain. The U.S. Naval Academy was likewise honored with his services as the Senior Catholic Chaplain. On 31 October 1980, Captain Laboon retired as Fleet Chaplain, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. After retirement from the navy, Father Laboon returned to Annapolis, Maryland, to oversee the construction of the Jesuit-retreat facility, Manresa-on-Severn, within view of the U.S. Naval Academy. His final assignment was pastor of St. Alphonsus Rodriguez Church in Woodstock, Maryland. He served there until his death on 1 August 1988. In 1993, the destroyer USS Laboon (DDG-58) was named in honor of Father Laboon. The Chaplain's Center at the Naval Academy is also named in his honor.

The elder brother of perhaps the more famous Jack Ford, Eric Ford was himself a star for both New South Wales and Australia in his own right.  Family and early life  Eric Ford was the son of a publican father who died when Eric was only six years of age, when the family had to move to Sydney. He began his early football career playing Australian Rules but switched to rugby when he and his brothers Jack and Percy went to St. Joseph's College at Hunters Hill in Sydney. They all had the unique benefit of learning the game from the remarkable Brother Henry.  Rugby career  On leaving school, with his brothers, he joined the Glebe- Balmain Club and was a member of the club's 1925 Sydney Premiership winning team. He was first selected for New South Wales in 1926. Troubled by frequent knee problems throughout his career, he nevertheless played on without demur and in 1929 won the New South Wales Rugby Union Sprint Championship. Eric Ford was selected for the 1927–28 Waratahs tour of the British Isles, France and Canada and appeared in all five internationals. Like brother Jack, he was an intuitive 'reader' of the game, coupled with a fine positional sense which allowed him to always be on hand to finish in fine style any break which had been made. He was good under the high ball and had splendid hands. He played his last two Tests in 1929 when the Australians won all three games against the All Blacks. Eric Ford, a modest man and quiet achiever, additionally played 68 first grade games for his club and featured in two premiership finals.  Recognition  Quiet and reserved, he was one of the great achievers in the famous 1927-28 Waratah tour to Great Britain, France and North America, with a total of 15 tries from 21 matches, equalled only by the great Cyril Towers.

It was the first of only two films directed by Roome (the other being the following year's comedy It's Not Cricket) during a long career as a film editor. The film stars Jack Warner and George Cole and was produced by Sydney Box. The title is taken from the story of Cain and Abel in the King James Bible: \\"am I my brother's keeper\\". Plot Handcuffed together, George Martin (Jack Warner) and Willie Stannard (George Cole) are two prisoners being transported to prison. Martin is a hardened, cynical career criminal, while Stannard is a naïve, rather dull-witted youth who has never previously been in trouble with the law, maintains his innocence of the rape for which he has been accused and is terrified by the prospect of prison. During the journey the pair manage to escape. Martin steals an army corporal's uniform and passes Stannard off as a deserter in his charge, being returned to face a military tribunal. In this manner, it cleverly explains why they are handcuffed together. The escape location has been chosen by Martin for its proximity to a garage run by his mistress Nora Lawrence (Jane Hylton), who provides the pair with overnight shelter. The following day Martin and Stannard take refuge in a derelict isolated cottage. While trying to file their handcuffs apart they are surprised by a hunting man with a gun. A struggle ensues, during which Martin strikes and kills the man. Shortly thereafter they manage to separate the handcuffs and Martin abandons Stannard, going on the run alone while Stannard gives himself up and is promptly charged with murder. Martin manages to contact his wife in London, asking if she can find a way to get money to him. She arranges to travel in a taxi driven by a friend of hers to the locality where he is hiding and to leave clothes and money for him at the barber's shop. Just as she arrives, the police have tracked Martin down and have him cornered, halting her progress. Rather than give himself up, Martin makes a final doomed attempt to escape through a warning-signed minefield, watched by police, reporters, his wife and mistress and a crowd of sensation-seeking gawkers.

Heatherly * Ben Williams as Policeman at Nora's Garage * Christopher Lee as Second Constable Production The film was originally known as Double Pursuit. It was produced by Sydney Box who had just taken over as head of production at Gainsborough Studios and was keen to develop new talent via lowered budgeted movies. The film was based on a story by journalist Maurice Wiltshire, his first for the movies; it was the first screenplay for Frank Harvey, first credit as full producer for Anthony Yarnborough, first film for Alfred Roome, first film for the editor and cinematographer, and first starring role for George Cole. Filming started in December 1947. Gainsborough had meant to make another movie that month called Roses Her Pillow, but production on that was postponed when Margaret Lockwood refused to star and Sydney Box could not find anyone he felt was suitable to replace her, so brought forward Double Pursuit on the studio's schedule. The original stars announced were Jack Warner, John McCallum and Peter Hammond. McCallum and Hammond did not appear in the final movie. The film was shot in 45 days, nine ahead of schedule and £20,000 under budget. My Brother's Keeper's exterior location sequences were filmed in the Buckinghamshire/Oxfordshire border area, including scenes shot at the now abandoned Aston Rowant railway station. Several people who worked on the film were rewarded with long-term contracts at Gainsborough. Reception My Brother's Keeper is a well-regarded film, with a reputation as a tight, tense and fast-moving thriller with Roome's previous editing experience being well utilised. The characterisation of the two main protagonists is praised for going deeper than the stereotypes of the tough, reckless criminal and the dim, hapless innocent. Via the 1950 film The Blue Lamp, and Dixon of Dock Green, the TV series developed from it which ran until the mid-1970s, Warner became forever engrained on the British consciousness as George \\"Evenin' all\\" Dixon, the avuncular upholder of law and order. My Brother's Keeper is often cited as an example of the dramatic range of which Warner was capable, before he became typecast. Cole's performance too is credited as one of the factors in his unusually smooth transition from child star to adult actor. The film's main weakness is cited as the interpolation of a pseudo-comic and largely irrelevant subplot involving a newspaper reporter trying to cover the story while on honeymoon in the area; although this 'framing device' could also be likened to the 'comic relief' interludes found in Shakespearian – and other – tragedies which somehow both enhance and make bearable the serious 'meat' of the drama. =Box Office= The film recorded a loss of £9,400.

Two hundred and thirty-two of these builds contribute to its historical value. The district was platted by William Robbins in the 1860s and 1870s following the completion of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Wealthy entrepreneurs moved to the district beginning in the 1890s due to its natural beauty and proximity to major golf resorts. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008 and features two houses previously honored by the register. History The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q;) was opened in 1862 and added a station in modern-day Hinsdale, Illinois two years later. Before the station was built, real estate developer William Robbins purchased , the first land in Hinsdale, including a lot for his own home. He platted the Town of Hinsdale in 1866, almost all of which was south of the railroad tracks. Robbins advertised the land in Chicago newspapers and built cottages and a school to promote residential development. He added land to the town later in 1866 and in 1871. Horace W. S. Cleveland was hired to plat the 1871 addition, which was in the emerging curvilinear style instead of the predominant gridiron plan. Curvilinear plans spared the local environment, maneuvering around large trees and hills. The Robbins Parks Addition was one of Cleveland's first ventures in the Midwest. The Great Chicago Fire caused many Chicago residents to reconsider a move to the suburbs, resulting in a population boom. The Highlands train station, just north of the Robbins Park district was added to the CB&Q; in 1873. By this time, the population of Hinsdale was 1,500. Hinsdale issued bonds to improve its public works, resulting in running water, electricity, and a sewage system for the town. Streets were paved with asphalt and brick. The Hinsdale Golf Club, opened west of Hinsdale in 1899, prompted wealthy patrons to move near the club. Hinsdale's reputation grew as one of Chicago's most beautiful suburbs of Chicago, and several publications heralded the architectural styling of the town. Local entrepreneurs flocked to the Robbins Park district. William Whitney was a member of the Illinois House of Representatives and first proposed legislation to incorporate Hinsdale. His house is independently listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). William Gibson Barfield was a local architect who designed the Hinsdale Theater and the Hinsdale State Bank, as well as many of the Robbins park residences. Howard George Hetzler was the President of the Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad and the Superintendent of the Chicago division of the CB&Q.; Charles G. Root was a partner of the United States Gypsum Corporation. Orland P. Bassett, whose house is also on the NRHP, was the first to commercially sell the American Beauty rose. Architecture Location of Robbins Park Historic District (red) within Hinsdale. The Downtown Hinsdale Historic District is in blue. The earliest homes in the district represent the Gothic Revival style, including Robbins' own. The most popular style of building in the district is Colonial Revival (sixty-three buildings). Most structures are from the Late Victorian era, but there are a few examples of more modern American Craftsman and bungalow designs. Four contributing houses are of Italianate design and thirty-two are Queen Anne style. The district is almost entirely residential, with the exception of four churches and two non-contributing businesses. The Boston, Massachusetts firm of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge designed the George H. and Carrie R. Mitchell House at 244 E. First Street in 1893. Eben Ezra Roberts designed the 1910 Prairie School Albert Wilson True House at 231 E. Third Street. Fellow Oak Park native John S. Van Bergen was the architect of the 1923 Harold Klock Residence at 306 S. County Line Road. Schmidt, Garden and Erickson was responsible for two Colonial residences, built in 1934 and 1937. Solon Spencer Beman, who designed the first company town of Pullman, Illinois, also designed the Church of Christ, Scientist building in the district in 1951.

Ransome devised the most sophisticated concrete structures in the United States at the time. Ernest was the son of Frederick Ransome, who had patented a process for producing artificial stone in 1844. Ernest was apprenticed to his father's factory in Ipswich. By the 1870s Ernest had moved to the USA and was the superintendent of the Pacific Stone Company in San Francisco. In 1884 after experimenting with reinforced concrete sidewalks, he patented () a system of ferro-concrete with the iron rods twisted to improve the bond, then developed a patented Ransome system for practical reinforced concrete construction. In 1886 Ransome built two small underpass bridges in the Golden Gate Park in San Francisco which survive today, and which are the first reinforced concrete bridges in North America, and among the first three or four in the world. After a long string of accomplishments Ransome continued to meet with skepticism and resistance. His techniques were vindicated when his 1897 Pacific Coast Borax Refinery in Bayonne, NJ in 1902 went through a massive building fire hot enough to melt brass; the concrete frame was only slightly damaged and thereby concrete framed industrial architecture was shown to have a key superiority over competing steel and iron framed structures. Likewise Ransome's two experimental buildings at Stanford survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake essentially without damage while the university's newer, conventional brick structures literally crumbled around them. The published analysis of these two buildings by fellow engineer John B. Leonard did much to advance the safety of buildings in post-1906 San Francisco and nationwide. In his later career Ransome focused on mixing equipment, formwork, and integrated building systems. In 1912 Ransome and Alexis Saurbrey co-authored Reinforced Concrete Buildings. Ransome's son was the notable American geologist Frederick Leslie Ransome (1868-1935).

In its simplest and original form, it asks under what conditions may a set E in two-dimensional Euclidean space \\\\mathbb{R}^2 be contained inside a rectifiable curve of finite length. So while in the original traveling salesman problem, one asks for the shortest way to visit every vertex in a graph with a discrete path, this analytical version requires the curve to visit perhaps infinitely many points. β-numbers A posteriori, for E to be contained in a rectifiable curve Γ, since Γ has tangents at H1-almost every point in Γ (where H1 denotes one- dimensional Hausdorff measure), E must look flat when you zoom in on points in E. This suggests that a condition that would tell us whether a set could be contained in a curve must somehow incorporate information about how flat E is when we zoom in on points of E at different scales. This discussion motivates the definition of the following quantity: :\\\\beta_{E}(Q)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\ell(Q)}\\\\inf\\\\\\\\{\\\\delta:\\\\text{ there is a line }L\\\\text{ so that for every }x\\\\in E\\\\cap Q, \\\\; \\\\text{dist}(x,L)<\\\\delta\\\\\\\\}, Where Q is any square, \\\\ell(Q) is the sidelength of Q, and dist(x, L) measures the distance from x to the line L. Intuitively, 2\\\\beta_E(Q)\\\\ell(Q) is the width of the smallest rectangle containing the portion of E inside Q, and hence \\\\beta_E(Q) gives us a scale invariant notion of flatness. Jones' traveling salesman theorem in R2 Let Δ denote the collection of dyadic squares, that is, : \\\\Delta=\\\\\\\\{[i2^{k},(i+1)2^{k}]\\\\times[j2^{k},(j+1)2^{k}]: i,j,k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\\\\\}, where \\\\mathbb{Z} denotes the set of integers. For a set E\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R}^2, define :\\\\beta(E)=\\\\text{diam} E+ \\\\sum_{Q\\\\in\\\\Delta}\\\\beta_{E}(3Q)^2 \\\\ell(Q) where diam E is the diameter of E. Then Peter Jones' analyst's traveling salesman theorem may be stated as follows: * There is a number C > 0 such that whenever E is a set with such that β(E) < ∞, E can be contained in a curve with length no more than Cβ(E). * Conversely (and substantially more difficult to prove), if Γ is a rectifiable curve, then β(Γ) < CH1(Γ). Generalizations and Menger curvature =Euclidean space and Hilbert space= The Traveling Salesman Theorem was shown to hold in general Euclidean spaces by Kate Okikiolu, that is, the same theorem above holds for sets E\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R}^d, d > 1, where Δ is now the collection of dyadic cubes in \\\\mathbb{R}^d defined in a similar way as dyadic squares. In her proof, the constant C grows exponentially with the dimension d. With some slight modifications to the definition of β(E), Raanan Schul showed Traveling Salesman Theorem also holds for sets E that lie in any Hilbert Space, and in particular, implies the theorems of Jones and Okikiolu, where now the constant C is independent of dimension. (In particular, this involves using β-numbers of balls instead of cubes). =Menger curvature and metric spaces= Hahlomaa further adjusted the definition of β(E) to get a condition for when a set E of an arbitrary metric space may be contained in the Lipschitz-image of a subset A\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R} of positive measure. For this, he had to redefine the definition of the β-numbers using menger curvature (since in a metric space there isn't necessarily a notion of a cube or a straight line). Menger curvature, as in the previous example, can be used to give numerical estimates that determine whether a set contains a rectifiable subset, and the proofs of these results frequently depend on β-numbers. = Denjoy–Riesz theorem = The Denjoy–Riesz theorem gives general conditions under which a point set can be covered by the homeomorphic image of a curve. This is true, in particular, for every compact totally disconnected subset of the Euclidean plane. However, it may be necessary for such an arc to have infinite length, failing to meet the conditions of the analyst's traveling salesman theorem.

As such, he frequently sent prisoners to Auschwitz for incarceration or execution. He visited Auschwitz on several occasions. In December 1944, he was appointed chief of the SiPo, Gestapo and SD in Vienna. After the war, Mildner testified at the Nuremberg Trials and remained in custody until 1949. Early life Born in Johannestal, Austrian Silesia, Mildner served as a volunteer in the Austro-Hungarian Navy during World War I. After the war, Mildner served in the Freikorps Sudetenland. Mildner trained to become a police officer in Salzburg. In 1925, he entered the Austrian police service. During that time Mildner furthered his education by attending night school. Nazi career He became a member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in 1931 with number 614,080. He achieved a doctorate of law at the University of Innsbruck in 1934. In 1935 he was forced to leave Austria and move to Germany. There he became a German citizen and entered the SS (number 275,741). Milder obtained a position in the political police department in Munich. After the 1938 Anschluss, Mildner became chief of the Gestapo in Linz and in 1939 in Salzburg, Austria. From December 1939 to early 1941 he led the Gestapo at Chemnitz. In March 1941 he was named as the head of the Gestapo in Katowice. It was through this office that Mildner became connected with the Auschwitz concentration camp and served as head of a \\"kangaroo court\\", which sentenced some 2,000 Poles to death. In 1942, he received the War Merit Cross, 2nd class for fighting the enemies of the Reich. In September 1943, Mildner was transferred to occupied Denmark as Gestapo chief to fight the Danish resistance movement and organize the deportation of the Danish Jews. Mildner oversaw security in Denmark in 1943 when the deportation of the Jews failed. 95% of them succeeded in sailing safely to neutral Sweden. Mildner tried to regain status by participating in the killing of Danish playwriter, priest and nazi opponent Kaj Munk. However, the failure in deportation of the Danish Jews was held against Mildner and he was transferred out of Denmark in January 1944. He then served as Inspector of the SiPo and SD in Kassel. From March 1944 to June 1944 he was Deputy Chief of sub-offices IVA and IVB (Enemies of the Regime & Activities of the Sects and Churches) in the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA). In December 1944, he was appointed the successor of Franz Josef Huber as chief of the SiPo, Gestapo and SD in Vienna. In this capacity, he was responsible for the court-martial and subsequent execution of resistance fighters Major Karl Biedermann, Captain (Hauptmann) Alfred Huth und First Lieutenant (Oberleutnant) Rudolf Raschke, who had tried to save Vienna from destruction by handing the city over to the Allies. After Vienna was captured by the Soviets, Mildner returned to Linz where he was the deputy of Franz Josef Huber. In May 1945, he escaped to the west and was arrested by the American army and testified at the Nuremberg Trials. The U.S. Army detained Mildner and \\"saved him from landing in the hands of war crimes investigators, because his knowledge of communist subversion was considered useful.\\"Salazar, Christian and Herschaft, Randy (2010-12-11) Declassified CIA Files Detail Ties Between U.S. And Ex-Nazis, Associated Press Nuremberg trials At Nuremberg he testified with regards to RSHA chief Ernst Kaltenbrunner. Mildner declared that while he was Gestapo leader at Katowice he frequently sent prisoners to Auschwitz for imprisonment or execution. He visited Auschwitz on several occasions and was shown the extermination installations. Mildner stated that he had tried to prevent the Jewish persecution in Denmark, but was overruled by Himmler. He was released in 1949 and disappeared to escape prosecution. His place and date of death are unknown; Adolf Eichmann claimed to have met Mildner in Argentina in 1958, but this claim has not been verified.

Wilson, directed by Montgomery Tully and starring Tony Wright, Patricia Dainton and Sandra Dorne. The plot centres on a benevolent poltergeist in a country home who protects a woman from her homicidal husband. It may be one of the first films to use the word 'poltergeist' in reference to a spirit or ghost. The film was never released to theatres in the US, and instead went straight to television. The screenplay, also by Wilson, is based on the 1955 novel The House in Marsh Road by Laurence Meynell. Plot Jean Linton (Dainton) has inherited £1000 and a country house, Four Winds, from her late aunt. She and her husband David (Wright), an alcoholic would-be novelist, move there, and are told by housekeeper Mrs. O'Brien (Anita Sharp-Bolster) that the home is already inhabited - by a poltergeist she has named 'Patrick', after her late husband. Patrick makes his presence known to Jean by moving furniture about, breaking mirrors, etc. Unhappy living in the country, David meets an estate agent at the local pub, who offers him £6000 for the house and land. David, however, can do nothing as they are in Jean's name and he is unable to convince her to sell. He hires local sexpot Valerie Stockley (Dorne) - she calls herself 'Mrs.' but her true marital status is questionable - as his typist and they begin an affair. Valerie tells David that once her divorce comes through, she'll be free to marry him, as he has proposed. But when she learns that Jean controls the property and the money, she angrily suggests that David kill Jean so that he can inherit. Patrick becomes quite protective of Jean after she discovers the affair. David makes attempts on Jean's life - trying to push her down the lift shaft in the house, dissolving an overdose of sleeping pills in her glass of hot milk - but each time, Patrick intervenes. He slams shut the lift gate before Jean can fall and causes a loud alarm to ring just as Jean is about to drink the doctored milk, which makes her realise that there is something wrong with it. Jean consults a solicitor in London about a divorce, but he tells her that her argument that a poltergeist is the only thing preventing David from murdering her 'won't hold water' in court. With Jean in London, David is free to have Valerie spend the night with him. Patrick takes the opportunity to punish them. As they're lying in bed, Patrick locks them in the bedroom and sets Four Winds aflame. When Jean returns later that night, having been driven home by her close friend and confidant Richard Foster (Derek Aylward), she learns that both David and Valerie have perished in the fire, trapped behind the bedroom's barred windows.

The House in Marsh Road was granted an A-certificate by the British Board of Film Censors on 26 July 1960. The A-cert meant that the film was considered to be 'more suitable for adults'.  Distribution  Theatrical distribution in the UK of The House in Marsh Road was by Grand National Pictures. The film was never distributed theatrically in the US. But under the title Invisible Creature, it was released to television in 1964 as part of American International Television's Amazing '65 syndication package, an 'eclectic assortment of 65 genre features' sold to individual TV stations around the US. As such, the movie was 'one of the earliest AITV releases', and was given an on-screen copyright date of 1964 and listed as an Alta Vista Production 'with UK production' by Merton Park Studios. Invisible Creature was broadcast, for example, in the 1960s on WIIC-TV in Pittsburgh on the 'monster movie' programme Chiller Theater on 23 July 1966 and 2 August 1969. It was also shown on WFLD-TV in Chicago numerous times during the 1970s: on Screaming Yellow Theater on 27 October 1972 and 2 March 1973; on WFLD Chiller Theater on 29 June 1975, 4 April 1976 and 15 August 1976; and on Monstrous Movie on 16 April 1977. More recently, the film was shown as The House in Marsh Road, its British title, on Talking Pictures TV in the UK on 11 October 2019. The House in Marsh Road was teamed with The Monkey's Paw (1948) for video distribution in the UK by Video Renown Productions Ltd. The video was given a PG rating on 8 May 2013 under the 1985 ratings guidelines issued for videos by the British Board of Film Classification, which defines PG as 'Parental Guidance - general viewing but some scenes may be unsuitable for young children'. Critical reception British film critic Phil Hardy is unimpressed by The House in Marsh Road, calling it 'a rather tame supernatural thriller' and describing Tully as 'a veteran of medium- and low-budget British programme fillers'. He notes, however, that instead of the people who usually do so in horror films, it is Patrick the poltereist who 'appears to be responsible for the house catching fire during a storm, trapping the adulterous couple in the flames'. American academic critic Rob Craig views the film in a more positive light. He calls it 'a cracking good drama with surprisingly adult themes', such as 'infidelity, alcoholism, paranoia and conspiracy'. And while it is 'essentially an old-fashioned ghost story', Craig writes that The House in Marsh Road 'comes to life due to an insightful screenplay, excellent characterizations and an abundance of atmosphere'. He also notes that the movie is perhaps one of the first to use the much-used-in-horror-films word 'poltergeist'. Steve Chibnall and Brian McFarlane, also British critics, point out that the four-way relationship of Jean, Richard, David and Valerie is somewhat unusual for its time in that it shows them living 'at some remove from the safety of quotidian middle-class mores'. The film offers 'an unusually frank picture of a grim marriage (...) with a suggestion of adultery', they write, also noting that for 'a haunted house mystery', it is one 'with (not rare in British Bs) a downbeat ending'. Wheeler W. Dixon, an American academic critic, pays special attention to the 'grim conclusion' of The House in Marsh Road. In line with Chibnall and McFarlane, he writes that 'in the stern moral universe the film inhabits, [David and Valerie's] violent deaths are seen as entirely deserved. Jean, it is implied, will move on through life with her new love, Richard'. A reviewer at Britmovie writes that 'this entertaining and atmospheric low-budget feature rises above the standard expected from the much-maligned b-movie.'

Geography  It is not obvious from a glance at a map that the Deister-Süntel valley extends northwards over the Süntel region to the Rodenberg Bowl (Rodenberger Mulde) east of the Bückeberg and the Aue valley, and southwards as far as the Hachmühle Basin (Hachmühle Becken), with the Kleiner Deister to the east, a distance of some 25 km. The rivers Hamel (which drains south into the Weser) and Rodenberger Aue (running north into the Leine), both rise on the watershed of the Deister-Süntel valley north of Bad Münder. They are fed by some 20 streams from the Deister and Süntel.  Geology  The Deister-Süntel valley originated in the Cretaceous period when the Süntel and Deister were pushed upwards into anticlines. As a result, deep rock strata from the Jurassic period were brought to the surface. Until the last ice age the Weser river flowed through the valley. When the ice masses impounded it, however, it looked for another route to the North Sea through the Porta Westfalica (gorge). Deposits of the Zechstein Sea from the Jurassic period, and later the Weser, as well as quantities of glacial sediment and fossilized vegetation from the Cretaceous period left many natural resources in the Deister-Süntel valley. Today, Wealden sandstones of the best quality are found here along with fossilized marine animals and coal beds. Gypsum, rock salt, gravel and sand occur, as well as salt and sulphur springs and glacial erratics. The wet and swampy landscape that persisted well into the 19th century is now fertile terrain covered with loess soils. Two geological strata from the Malm epoch are named after villages in the area: \\"Münden marl\\" (Münder Mergel) and \\"Eimbeckhausen Plateau Chalk\\" (Eimbeckhäuser Plattenkalk).  Flora und fauna  Windmills in Rodenberg Large areas of the Deister, Bückeberg and Süntel are covered in beech forest, interlaced with oak and spruce. Rare orchids occur wild in several places. European Holly (Hülse) is common here and gives its name to the village of Hülsede. A botanical feature of this region is the Dwarf Beech, known in German as the Süntelbuche. There are still several old examples of this rare tree to be found in the Deister-Süntel valley: in the Süntel near Hülsede, in the Deister near Feggendorf and Köllnischfeld, in Lauenau, Beber, Luttringhausen and Bad Münder. The last existing dwarf beech forest was cleared in 1843 near Hülsede wurde 1843. The amphibians, once common in the original swampy lowlands are still present in small numbers. To protect them, as well as birds of prey and songbirds, new ponds have been constructed, grasslands purchased and hedge shrubs planted to create a network of biotope habitats.  Settlements  The largest settlements in the valley are Apelern, Bad Münder, Hülsede, Lauenau, Messenkamp, Pohle and Rodenberg. Other villages include Algesdorf, Altenhagen I, Altenhagen II, Bakede, Beber, Böbber, Egestorf, Eimbeckhausen, Feggendorf, Flegessen, Groß Hegesdorf, Hachmühlen, Hamelspringe, Hasperde, Hemschehausen, Klein Süntel, Kleinhegesdorf, Luttringhausen, Lyhren, Meinsen, Nettelrede, Nienstedt, Reinsdorf, Rohrsen, Schmarrie, Sedemünde, Soldorf and Waltershagen.

Legislative history 2007–2008 On 20 September 2007, after consulting on policy options for climate change and energy, the Labour-led Government announced that it intended to establish an emissions trading scheme in order to respond to climate change. Prime Minister Helen Clark stated: \\"The Government believes that an emissions trading scheme which puts a price on emissions creates the right incentives across the economy to use fuel and energy more efficiently\\". On 4 December 2007, the Labour Government introduced the Climate Change (Emissions Trading and Renewable Preference) Bill into Parliament. The bill amended the Climate Change Response Act 2002 by inserting an emissions trading scheme including all sectors of the economy and all greenhouse gases. The bill also a restricted the commissioning of any new fossil-fuelled thermal power stations for 10 years. On 9 September 2008, the sections of the Climate Change (Emissions Trading and Renewable Preference) Bill establishing the NZ ETS were separated into the Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment bill. On 10 September 2008, the Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 had its third reading in Parliament and was adopted 63 votes to 57 with support from the Green Party and New Zealand First. The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008 received the royal assent on 25 September 2008. Summary of Labour NZ ETS The proposed scheme was to cover all six greenhouse gases specified in the Kyoto Protocol, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). It would be economy-wide, covering all sectors including agriculture. 'Participants' who must account for their emissions will be few and high in the production chain of each sector and will have to surrender one New Zealand unit (NZU) or one internationally tradable Kyoto-compliant unit for each tonne of emissions. New Zealand units will be capped in number and distributed to participants either by grandparenting (gifting) or auctioning. Sectors would enter the NZ ETS at staggered dates, from January 2008 (forestry) through until January 2013 (agriculture), and have differing allocations of free New Zealand units. In general, participants who can pass on costs of the ETS, such as fuel companies to motorists, would not be allocated free units. While participants whose produce is priced internationally, such as dairy exporters, would be allocated a level of free units. Lack of a cap In 2007, the Ministry for the Environment acknowledged that the NZ ETS would not have a binding, absolute limit on the total level of emissions allowed in New Zealand. While the quantity of NZ Units gifted to eligible emitters would be fixed, the quantity of international 'Kyoto-compliant' units that could be brought in to match emissions would not be limited. Unlike most other emissions trading schemes the NZ ETS has no limit on the volume of international emissions units (CERs and ERUs) that may be imported. Consequently, there is no cap or limit on the volume of emissions permitted in New Zealand provided that emissions units are imported into the country and surrendered. Ministry for the Environment Fact Sheet 16 stated: “There is no cap on the emissions that occur within New Zealand.” However, the Ministry for the Environment still regarded the NZ ETS as operating within the cap on emissions established by the Kyoto Protocol for the first commitment period of 2008–2012. Moyes (2008) describes this as a \\"flexible cap\\" where New Zealand sourced emissions regulated by the NZETS are constrained only by the international market price for GHG emissions. Greenpeace noted that the proposed NZ ETS placed no limit on the number of permits that could be imported into New Zealand and it did not include a domestic emission reduction target. Greenpeace considered that in operation the NZ ETS would be a carbon tax with the rate set by the world market price. Bertram and Terry (2008, p35) concluded that the NZ ETS is not a cap-and-trade scheme as described in the economics literature because it does not place a cap on New Zealand's emissions of greenhouse gases. Units of trade and international linkage The 2008 NZ ETS created a new emission unit, the New Zealand Unit (NZU), which the Ministry for the Environment described as being the 'primary domestic unit of trade'. The NZU is equivalent to one metric tonne of greenhouse gases in a one-year compliance period. The NZU is 'backed' by an assigned amount unit. It is the NZUs that will be allocated by 'grandfathering\\" to forestry, industry, energy, fishing and agriculture under an allocation plan. As noted in the previous paragraph, participants in the NZ ETS could also use most of the 'Kyoto Units' to meet their surrender obligations. The permitted units were: Assigned amount units (AAUs), Emission Reduction Units (ERUs), Removal Units (RMUs), and Certified Emission Reductions (CERs). However, temporary CERs and iCERS cannot be used, and neither can CERs and ERUs generated from nuclear projects. Consequently, compared to other emissions trading schemes, the NZ ETS is highly linked to the international markets and will be a price-taker. The Sustainability Council called for the existing international emission units established under the Kyoto protocol to be used instead of the New Zealand Units. Allocation of emission units Under the Labour Government's initial proposal, allocation of NZUs would have been by a mix of auctioning and \\"grandfathering\\" (free allocation to existing emitters based on historic emissions). Forestry, transport, energy and industry would have had to obtain units by auction. Industries defined as 'trade-exposed' would have received a free allocation of 90% of their 2005 emissions. Agriculture would have received an allocation of units equivalent to 90% of 2005 emissions. In the final version as set out in the Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008, forest owners with pre-1990 forests were to receive a fixed one-off free allocation of units. Transport (Liquid fossil fuels), stationary energy and industrial processes would not receive any free allocation of units. Trade-exposed industry & energy would receive a free allocation of 90% of 2005 emissions annually to 2018. From 2019 to 2029 the free allocation would phase out at the rate of a 1/12 (8.3%) reduction each year. Agriculture would receive a free allocation of 90% of 2005 emissions each year to 2018. From 2019 to 2029 the free allocation would phase out at the rate of a 1/12 (8.3%) reduction each year. Fishing would receive a free allocation of 50% of 2005 emissions each year from July 2010 to January 2013. Effectiveness of price incentive for emission reduction Professor Jonathan Boston, Director of the Institute of Policy Studies (New Zealand) at Victoria University of Wellington, commented that the 2008 NZ ETS will be less effective in reducing emissions because of political compromises such as the delayed sector entry dates and the extended period of free allocation of emissions units. Dr Suzi Kerr, an economist and Senior Fellow at Motu Economic and Public Policy Research, commented that the NZ ETS would be costly to tax payers as it provided for very high levels of free allocation of emission units to emitters. In August 2007, Infometrics economist Adolf Stroombergen wrote an opinion article about permit auctions and free allocation for the Dominion Post. Stroombergen noted that giving permits to emitters instead of selling them in an auction had very different wealth distribution effects, with major emitters the biggest beneficiaries. So he asked why allocate and not auction? One reason is to compensate firms for 'stranded' assets that have less value due to emissions trading. In that case the compensation should only be the loss in asset value. Stroombergen considered New Zealand was only likely to have a few 'stranded' assets. The second reason is to compensate firms who may be at competitive disadvantage with overseas firms whose emissions are without a carbon price. Stroombergen considered that only basic commodities competing entirely on price would face this competitive risk, and that he would expect to see most permits auctioned, not given away as there is no economic basis for ongoing free allocation of permits. In May 2008, Chris Schilling, an economist at the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER), argued that free allocation of emissions units to ‘at-risk’ firms competing in export markets was necessary to maintain their competitiveness. Schilling also argued that the assumption that allocation is a transfer of wealth from households to industry may also be incorrect. This is based on NZIER modelling which suggests that because allocation protects the competitiveness of New Zealand firms, it reduces the economic impact of the ETS. So the cost of allocation needs to be measured against the cost of not giving allocation. Finally Schilling states that allocation is needed to maintain the environmental integrity of the scheme. Allocation to efficient New Zealand firms reduces the risk that emissions will 'leak' offshore. Reducing the output of New Zealand firms, it is argued, will result in increased production in another nation, and perhaps a net increase in global emissions. Economist Geoff Bertram compared the price incentives of the 2008 NZ ETS with a carbon or greenhouse gas tax for Kyoto commitment period 1, 2008 to 2012. A tax of $NZ30 per tonne, on the 386 million tonnes of emitted greenhouse gases likely to be emitted from 2008 to 2012, would give a price signal (or government revenue) of $NZ11.6 billion. The exemptions and subsidies in Labour's ETS would have reduced that to about $NZ1 billion. In terms of the obligation to surrender emissions permits, Labour's ETS would have reduced the gross hypothetical surrender obligation of 386 million credits (one for each tonne) for the five years down to 35 million credits. Sector entry dates In the Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading) Amendment Act 2008, the sector entry dates were; * 1 January 2008 : Forestry * 1 January 2010 : Stationary energy, Industrial processes, Trade-exposed Industry & Energy, Fishing * 1 January 2011 : Transport (Liquid fossil fuels): * 1 January 2013 : Agriculture: Reactions In September 2008, National Party climate change spokesman Nick Smith described the NZ ETS as 'rushed', 'flawed' and 'riddled with errors'. Business New Zealand Chief Executive Phil O’Reilly described the legislation as \\"deficient\\",\\"a risk to our economy\\" and an \\"example of poor law-making\\". The Sustainability Council stated that farmers and big industries were being heavily exempted through gifted allocations of New Zealand Units which were effectively off-balance sheet subsidies. Jeanette Fitzsimons, the Co-Leader of the Green Party said that she thought the NZ ETS was a 'first step' and that New Zealanders should avoid thinking that the NZ ETS 'fixed' climate change. The Greens co-leader Russel Norman questioned the fact that agriculture would not enter the NZ ETS until 2013 and that the delay represented a $1.2 billion subsidy for the dairy industry. Norman said that existing technology allowed farmers to reduce emissions, and the agriculture sector should join the NZ ETS on the same timetable as fuel companies - in 2009, rather than 2013. Greenpeace Aotearoa described the 2008 NZ ETS as \\"weakened and watered down\\" and too generous to agriculture and other big polluters. Greenpeace considered that the NZ ETS would not drive the deep emission cuts needed to prevent global warming. Spokesperson Simon Boxer said: \\"This is very much a case of something being better than nothing.\\" To express opposition to the NZ ETS, the ACT Party put on a piece of street theatre where a \\"witch\\" whipped a \\"farmer\\" who was dragging an oversized cheque made out to Russia for $NZ 5 billion from the New Zealand taxpayer. During the development of the scheme, John Stephenson of NZIER commented that the Government should \\"Take a breath and have a cup of tea\\" before proceeding. In Stephenson's opinion the negative effect of ETS on economic growth was too great. NZIER economic modeling was reported to have shown the Labour ETS would take $3000 off individual household spending annually and cost 20,000 jobs. The modelling also showed that the Labour ETS would reduce the value of dairy land by 40 per cent and reduce dairy exports by 13 per cent. In April 2009, the Sustainable Energy Forum described the NZ ETS as an \\"almost completely ineffective means of reducing New Zealand's gross greenhouse gas emissions\\".

Constructing Excellence attempts to apply the reforms recommended in the 1994 Latham and 1998 Egan Reports, having absorbed several bodies established following those reports. In August 2016, Constructing Excellence became part of BRE, but retains its identity and core purposes. History Prior to its BRE merger, Constructing Excellence was itself the result of over a decade of UK construction industry reform initiatives. Its roots can be traced back to the establishment of the Construction Industry Board (a forerunner of the Strategic Forum for Construction), following the recommendations of the 1994 Latham Report,Latham, M. (1994), Constructing the Team, London: HMSO. to oversee industry reform, including the application of partnering by construction project teams.Ward & Crane, 2003 In parallel, industry reform group the Reading Construction Forum was developing guidance on partnering in construction,for example, Bennett, J. and Jayes, S. (1995) Trusting the Team, Reading: Centre for Strategic Studies in Construction, The University of Reading, with the partnering task force of the Reading Construction Forum. and the Design Build Foundation (DBF) was launched in 1997, drawing together construction industry customers, designers, contractors, consultants, specialists, and manufacturers representing the whole construction supply chain. In early 1998 the Construction Best Practice Programme (CBPP, and its sister programme, IT Construction Best Practice, ITCBP) was created to provide guidance, advice and support on implementing change to UK construction and client organisations, instituting regional best practice clubs and producing case studies. Following the October 1998 publication of the Egan Report, Rethinking construction,Egan, J. (1998) Rethinking Construction: Report of the Construction Task Force, London: HMSO. Movement for Innovation (M4i) and the Confederation of Construction Clients (superseding the Construction Clients' Forum, formed in 1994) were established, along with focused sector groups: the Housing Forum, a Local Government Task Force (LGTF) and a Central Government Task Force (a Government Construction Clients Panel, GCCP, had been established after the 1996 Levene Report, Efficiency Scrutiny into Construction Procurement by Government). In March 1999, the Office of Government Commerce launched an \\"Achieving Excellence\\" programme to improve the performance of government departments, as well as their executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies. This profusion of groups and initiatives proved unwieldy, and during the early years of the 21st century, several mergers took place: *In October 2002, the DBF and Reading Construction Forum merged to form a new supply chain body, Collaborating for the Built Environment, known as Be. *In 2003, M4i, the Construction Best Practice Programme, Housing Forum, LGTF and GCCP were combined as Constructing Excellence, which continued the best practice clubs and M4i demonstration project programmes. *In 2005, Constructing Excellence and Be merged. *In August 2007 Constructing Excellence took over the Network for Construction Collaboration Technology Providers, but this quickly became defunct. In August 2016, Constructing Excellence merged with BRE, with BRE set to maintain the Constructing Excellence brands and functions. Constructing Excellence was set to become a wholly owned subsidiary of BRE and retain its managing structure and CEO. The establishment of a Constructing Excellence Foundation, under the BRE Trust, would allow trading profit to be channelled into research and education for its member companies. Activities As well as continuing the best practice clubs network and demonstration projects work started by the CBPP and M4i, Constructing Excellence produced several industry reports including: *Be Valuable, an assessment of life-time cost approaches such as 1:5:200, written by Richard Saxon and published in 2005. *continued development since 2006 of the Avanti ICT research project including making Avanti part of the update of BS 1192.British Standards, BS 1192:2007 Collaborative production of architectural, engineering and construction information. Code of practice *the Wolstenholme Report (Never Waste a Good Crisis), written by Andrew Wolstenholme and published in 2009, which reviewed progress since the 1998 Egan Report and made further recommendations to the industry. *jointly with the JCT in 2009, Constructing Excellence launched the JCT Constructing Excellence collaborative contract (originally the Be Collaborative Contract developed by a Reading Construction Forum working group and published in September 2003). It also undertakes UK government consultancy work, including compilation (with BRE) of the industry's annual Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which are included in the ONS's Construction Statistics Annual. The first KPIs were produced in 1998 by M4i. Constructing Excellence provides administrative support to the Construction Clients' Group (formerly the Confederation of Construction Clients) and, where appropriate, works in partnership with the pan-industry government liaison body, the Strategic Forum for Construction (successor to the Construction Industry Board).

Lange \\"europeanized\\" Turkish military music and was one of the pioneers to bring German and European classical music to the Ottoman capital in the years between 1880 and 1920.  Life  Lange was born in Kartzow, Prussia, the descendant of an old Prussian teacher family. He was trained at the teacher's college in Neuruppin to become a school teacher. He graduated from that college in 1879 with honors. Because of his high musical skills, he was then admitted to the \\"Royal Academic Institute for Church Music\\" in Berlin, where he received training as church organist. In 1880, Lange moved to Constantinople, where he assumed a position as music teacher at the German School (Alman Lisesi) as well as organist of the Chapel of the German Embassy. Subsequently Lange also became music teacher at various other institutes of higher education in Constantinople, including several Greek and Armenian high schools (lycées) as well as American colleges such as Robert College and American College for Girls. Lange became a successful piano teacher and subsequently also formed his private conservatory, which however had to declare bankruptcy after two years. He transformed an existing Italian orchestra into a large German-style symphony orchestra with which he conducted the first performances ever of Beethoven symphonies and Wagner operas in the Ottoman Empire, with enormous success. Finally, during his visit to Constantinople in 1898, Kaiser Wilhelm II, who had already appointed him a \\"Kaiserlicher Musikdirektor\\" in 1894, became aware of Lange and helped him gain a position as head of a naval military orchestra of the Ottoman Navy. Subsequently, he took over several other military ensembles, before finally being appointed Director of the Sultan's music after the revolution in 1908. Since then Lange carried the Ottoman Court title \\"Bey\\". As a member of the Ottoman court, Lange was allowed to stay in Istanbul by the Allied Military Administration when all other Germans and Austrians were deported from the city. When Lange died in Üsküdar, Ottoman Empire, in December, 1919, he received a state funeral, and the British Embassy chaplain performed the funeral at Feriköy Protestant Cemetery. However, his widow and his youngest daughter, who had stayed with him in Istanbul, were deported to Germany only a few months later in May 1920. The German-American conductor Hans Lange (assistant of Arturo Toscanini in New York City, later conductor at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, best known for numerous recordings with the Wagner soprano Kirsten Flagstad) was the oldest son of Paul Lange. Paul Lange was a close friend of fellow German lecturer Dr Friedrich Schrader, also faculty member at Robert College in the 1890s.

History  thumb A previous church on the site was built in 1866 by the order of the Governor-General of the Northwestern Krai Konstantin von Kaufman for the needs of the local garrison and was consecrated in honour of the emperor Constantine I and his mother Helena. Usually referred to as the Iron church (Железная церковь, Dzelzs baznīca) because of its external cladding, it was dismantled and rebuilt at Tsargrad (now Jersika), where it still remains, following the decision to build a new garrison cathedral at the original site. The contemporary church was built in 1904–1905, the construction work being financed by the military. It was consecrated on in honour of the Holy Righteous Princes and Passion-bearers Boris and Gleb and Saint Alexius, Metropolitan of Moscow.  Architecture  View of the apse The church was built in the Neo-Russian style. It is a three-aisled masonry church, which on the plan forms an oblong rectangular with a polygonal apse and resembles a ship. The cathedral has ten towers with gilded cupolas. The interiors include murals and ceiling pieces. It has been suggested that the icons on the oak iconostasis in the cathedral are copies of works by Viktor Vasnetsov in St. Vladimir's Cathedral, Kiev.

This Baltasar the Younger established himself later as a portrait painter in Amsterdam and his works have been misattributed to his uncle. Work =General= Balthasar Beschey painted in the first half of his career mainly landscapes but later he switched to history and portrait painting. He also produced a number of genre paintings. He often followed and even copied the work of Rubens and van Dyck in his history paintings and that of Jan Brueghel the Elder in his landscapes.Balthasar Beschey: Die Ruhe auf der Flucht at Van Ham About Theobald Michau at Jean Moust A religious composition which is not derivative of Rubens is The liberation of St Peter from his chains painted for a clandestine church in Amsterdam. =Genre scenes= The Hermitage Museum has two genre paintings by Beschey which represent the five senses, a subject popular in Flemish art.Beschey’s works at the Hermitage Christie’s sold another pair of genre scenes at its 30 March 2015 sale in Paris (lot 15) representing respectively a fishmarket and a Commedia dell'Arte scene.Beschey’s genre works at the Christie’s sale Portrait of Jacques-Jean Cremers and his wife, dancing, on a garden terrace =Portraits= Balthasar Beschey painted single as well as group portraits.

He is working on a figure composition but it is not clear exactly which subject he is painting. It could be a Venus with Cupid or alternatively, an allegory, possibly of the fine arts. The work is very similar in style to French portraiture of that time.

It is ituated in the heart of the Lamington National Park, two hours by road south of Brisbane and 90 minutes by road west of the Gold Coast. Access to the mountain resort is via Canungra. O'Reilly's Rainforest Retreat consists of accommodation villas, picnic grounds and marks the starting point of a number of popular hiking trails. It is well known for its rainforest location, unique and diverse wildlife, and for being the home of the late Bernard O'Reilly, an Australian bushman and author, who is remembered for his efforts in locating the survivors of the 1937 Stinson plane crash.  History  In 1912, eight men of the O'Reilly family each started farming in the McPherson Range. They milked cattle and collected timber but the income was too little. In 1915 Lamington National Park was established around their land. O'Reilly's Rainforest Retreat was founded in 1926 by the O'Reilly brothers. The initial accommodation was very basic and in the early years access was only via horse and wagon along a precipitous mountain track. St Joseph's Catholic Church was the first Catholic church in the Logan River valley and was opened in 1876 on a site, then known as Tullamore Hill, later as Veresdale, and now within Gleneagle. In 1936 the church was lined and ceiled for the first time. By the early 1950s the small church was in poor repair and it had a very small congregation (St Mary's Catholic Church in Beaudesert was very large and by then the major town of the district). At that time, Mass was being held regularly at the O'Reilly Guesthouse in Goblin Wood, the private home of Bernard O'Reilly, so it was decided to relocate St Joseph's to the O'Reilly Guesthouse as a permanent church. It was dismantled, transported via Canungra and re-assembled. On 27 November 1955, Father Steele presided over the first Mass in the relocated church () and Archbishop James Duhig performed the opening ceremony. Although privately owned by the O'Reilly family, it is still strongly associated with the Beaudesert Catholic parish. Between 1990-1994 extensions to the resort designed by architect Maurice Hurst began updating the guesthouse accommodation and other buildings.  Attractions  Bird feeding is encouraged with seed available for sale to visitors. Bush walking is another popular activity in the area. =Birdlife= Crimson rosellas The forests of Lamington National Park provide excellent habitat for a range of birds. Some species have become unconcerned by close interaction with people at O'Reilly's, including the regent bowerbird, Australian king parrot and crimson rosellas. Wonga pigeons and the Australian brush turkey are also common. = 1937 Stinson crash site = Bronze statue at O'Reilly's Guesthouse depicting the rescue The Australian National Airways Stinson crash was an accident which occurred on 19 February 1937. The Stinson Model A airliner disappeared during a flight from Brisbane to Sydney, carrying five passengers and two pilots. Both pilots and two passengers were killed in the crash. One of the surviving passengers died while attempting to bring help to the other survivors. The wreckage was found by Bernard O'Reilly of the Lamington Guest House who went looking for the aircraft believing it had failed to cross the border. The aircraft had crashed in the McPherson Range on the border between Queensland and New South Wales.(4 October 2012). Stinson plane crash inquest . Queensland State Archives. Retrieved 15 October 2015. O'Reilly's is situated approximately 8.4 kilometres from the site of the 1937 Stinson plane crash. As a result, the site of the wreck has become a popular hiking destination with bushwalkers. O'Reilly's Rainforest Retreat infrequently organises guided treks to the wreck, but experienced bushwalkers are known to frequently attempt the hike. The hike is renowned for its difficulty due to the steep nature of the McPherson Range where the wreck is situated, and the thick, dense terrain of the rainforest. A memorial to Bernard O'Reilly is located in the grounds around the guesthouse. In the late 1980s, the Australian Army removed large portions of the wreck using a helicopter. As a result, only a small, skeletal section of the plane's hull remains. = Tree Top Walk = In 1987, O'Reilly's Rainforest Retreat opened the Tree Top Walk, a 180 metre long suspension bridge situated 20 metres above the rainforest floor. The Tree Top Walk provides a bird-eye view of the rainforest canopy and sweeping views of the McPherson Range. It was the first of its kind in Australia.

The dam was built between 1941 and 1943 and created San Vicente Reservoir for the purpose of municipal water storage, flood control and recreation. Although the reservoir is fed by run-off, its main source is the First San Diego Aqueduct. In June 2009, construction to raise the height of the dam by , in order to more than double its reservoir size, commenced. It is the largest dam raise in the United States and largest roller-compacted concrete dam raise in the world. The dam raise project was originally set for the end of 2012, but was completed in early 2014. Efforts to replace the water supply pipelines and prepare the reservoir for the public will be underway until 2015-2017. History San Vicente Dam under construction in 1942 In the late 19th century, San Diego began constructing dams to help supply municipal water, mitigate drought and control floods in the San Diego River Basin. In 1928, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California was created and charged with transferring water from the Colorado River to southern California but San Diego was excluded from the project. Construction of the Colorado River Aqueduct had begun in 1933 and was completed in 1941. However, construction on the San Vicente Dam began in 1941 with anticipation of San Diego receiving water through the Colorado River Aqueduct. San Diego residents had initially rejected proposals to build the San Vicente Dam in 1939 but after the realization of the city's growing population, voters quickly approved funding for the San Vicente Dam in 1940. Construction on the dam included pouring concrete into blocks measuring and incorporating a wide uncontrolled ogee-type spillway on the dam's downstream face. The outlet works, which release water for municipal use, connected the reservoir intake on the upstream side of the crest with San Vicente Pipelines 1 and 2 via three cast-iron pipes in diameter. In 1944, the San Diego County Water Authority (SDCWA) was formed and would soon begin construction on an aqueduct from the Colorado River Aqueduct called the San Diego Aqueduct to supply projected future water needs. Construction on the San Vicente Dam was completed in 1943 but construction on the First San Diego Aqueduct, which was supplied by the Colorado River Aqueduct, did not begin until 1945. It was not until 1947 that the First Aqueduct was complete and the San Vicente Reservoir began to receive its water. =Dam raising= As part of the SDCWA's $1 billion Emergency Storage Project which began in 2000, the San Vicente Dam Raise increased the height of the dam by to . This in turn will more than double the reservoir's original capacity of by increasing it to a total of . The original designers had predicted that raising the dam would be necessary in the future and positioned the dam in such a way that its height could be increased by as much as 120 ft along with ensuring its grout curtain was extended for a larger foundation. In 2006, the SDCWA awarded Montgomery Watson Harza (MWH) with a $20.4 million contract which included developing the raised-dam's design and other engineering services during construction. Construction on the roller-compacted concrete (RCC) dam raise is being managed by Black & Veatch and Parsons and was done in specific stages. The first stage began in June 2009 and consisted of preparing the dam's foundation and was completed in 2010 after which the dam raise began. The construction reached a milestone on October 2012 as the dam reached its final height of 337 feet. The new dam is 117 feet higher than the old one, the tallest dam raise in the United States. The dam raise was completed in early 2014. The reservoir's replacement pipeline will last until 2015. The reservoir, which was closed for recreation when construction began, will reopen between 2014 and 2017 depending on when it reaches normal levels. The San Vicente Dam Raise itself was estimated to cost $568 million and will be complemented with a new pumping facility and the San Vicente Pipeline which will connect the San Vicente Reservoir to the Second San Diego Aqueduct. The RCC raised-dam will be the tallest dam raise in the United States along with the tallest of its type in the world.

It is Regal Films' first offering for its 50th anniversary. This is also the last film appearance of actor AJ Perez, who died in a vehicular accident in Moncada, Tarlac on April 17, 2011 at the aged of 18.  Synopsis  Mamarazzi is the story of a mother who constantly pries into the lives of her three children, often resulting in riotous and hilarious situations. Fifteen years ago, Violy Langit (Eugene Domingo), an owner of a small funeral parlor, learns that she is suffering from a medical condition that requires her to undergo a hysterectomy. All her life, she’s wanted to have children; she realizes that she has to do it before the procedure. But Violy has no man in her life -- no husband, no boyfriend, no suitors. She seeks the help of her best friend, Mandy (John Lapus). Out of pity and love for Violy, Mandy offers his boyfriend Carlo (Diether Ocampo) to serve as a sperm donor. With Mandy’s blessing, Violy and Carlo share a night filled with romance, passion, and mystery -- for after that night, Carlo disappears completely from the lives of Violy and Mandy. But later revealed that he tried to steal Violy's money. Violy gets her wish. She is blessed with a set of triplets -- two girls, Peachy and Strawberry (Andi Eigenmann in a dual role), and one boy, Dingdong (AJ Perez) -- which she raises as a single mother. As the children gets older, Violy, with all her might, does all ways and means to have happy kids even to the extent of helping her son get the girl that he wants: Mimi (Carla Abellana). Being an extremely controlling and overly nosy mother makes her kids wonder about their mom’s intentions. Little do her children know that all she’s doing is to make her family happy. Adding to the children’s frustration is getting her mom to reveal the real identity of their father (revealed to be a bartender she knew during her drunken stupor). As tensions run high and emotions soar, their story explodes in a flurry of shocking, funny, and quirky revelations that forever change everyone’s life.

Invasion of Normandy on\\"D-Day, 6 June 1944. \\"No Smoking\\" sign on the ramp. Smoking in the United States military has been observed in previous wars, but smoking's close association with the United States military started in World War I when tobacco companies began to target military personnel through the distribution of cigarettes to servicemen and the eventual inclusion of cigarettes into rations. Although the military has attempted to implement tobacco control initiatives, the association between smoking and military personnel has persisted to the present day as smoking rates remain high, despite declines in civilian rates. Such high rates have led to questions about the effect of smoking from the apparent health risks to troop readiness and training costs. Smoking in the US military from 1917 to 1975 Wounded soldiers at Omaha Beach on D-Day With the entrance of the United States into World War I in 1917, cigarette use increased dramatically among United States military personnel as they were targeted by tobacco companies which touted cigarettes as a way for soldiers to psychologically escape from their current circumstances, boosting overall troop morale.Brandt, Allan M. 2007. The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product that Defined America. New York: Basic Books, pp. 50–53Goodman, J. (Ed.). (2005). Tobacco history and culture: An encyclopedia. Detroit: Scribner's. Tobacco was viewed as indispensable to the war effort; General Pershing said \\"You ask me what we need to win this war. I answer tobacco as much as bullets. Tobacco is as indispensable as the daily ration; we must have thousands of tons without delay.\\" Cigarettes became so integrated into life on the battlefield that these symbols of pleasure and comfort were also used as a form of currency. Although cigarettes had been regarded as a physical and moral hazard by early anti-tobacco movements around this time, by 1918, previously anti-cigarette organizations and the military began supporting efforts to distribute cigarettes to troops. The New York Times garnered support for these efforts by stating that cigarettes \\"lighten[ed] the inevitable hardships of war\\", and another popular periodical described cigarettes as the \\"last and only solace of the wounded.\\" With the rise of World War II, tobacco companies continued to foster this culture of wartime smoking by sending free cigarettes to troops and supporting the inclusion of cigarettes into the soldiers' rations. Advertisements also encouraged citizens back home to support the troops by sending cigarettes.\\"Stahl, R.\\" In 1965, first during the U.S. Army’s Basic Training Course and later in Pre-Airborne Infantry Training, while being allowed a break from P.T., or during a long march, it was commonplace for a Drill Sergeant to say \\"smoke ’em if you got ’em, do pushups if you don’t\\". Non-smoking soldiers would quickly \\"bum\\" a cigarette from a friend and they too would soon be smokers. Despite mounting evidence in the 1950s of the adverse health effects of smoking and tobacco use, the military continued to include cigarettes in rations until 1975. Attempts at tobacco control initiatives \\"Prevent\\" course booklet, participant workbook September 2003, including tobacco issues. With the scientific data about the health risks of smoking and information about the effect of smoking on troop readiness, in 1975, the United States Department of Defense discontinued the inclusion of cigarettes in K-rations and C-rations. By 1978, the Department of Defense had implemented basic smoking regulations, including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas. In 1985, the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel (47%) were significantly higher than that of US civilians (30%) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness. The report also cited an estimated tobacco-related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million, and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military, including the elimination of tobacco products from stores, raising tobacco prices to civilian levels, and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking. In 1986, the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who announced, \\"an intense anti- smoking campaign…at all levels of all Services.\\" It established a policy on smoking and other health risk behaviors such as alcohol consumption. The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training, increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas, and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty. The goal of the policy was to reduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians, and to reduce personnel and active duty rates from 52% to 25% by 1990. In 1992, the DeCA Directive 40-13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with promotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military personnel, and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back. In 1993, the became the first smoke-free Navy ship. By 1994, the Department of Defense had implemented Directive 1010.15 which banned smoking in workplaces, designated outdoor smoking areas, and created the precursor of an education program that sought to distribute information to new personnel on the health effects of smoking and to encourage smokers to quit. Executive Order 13508 in 1997 banned smoking in all government-owned, rented, or leased interior spaces, but the Department of Defense approved a three-year phase-in period for their facilities and eventually implemented the ban on December 7, 2002. Despite these attempts, by 1988, the smoking rate had only decreased to 42% and far exceeded the rate of civilians. And although prevalence did decrease to 29.9% from 1980 to 1998, it has increased since then and appears to still be increasing. =Tobacco industry's response= Vietnam War, 1969. Realizing the opportunities of a worldwide military market due to the young demographics of military personnel and the smoking initiation associated with new recruits, the Tobacco Institute, which served as the tobacco industry's lobbying organization, and Philip Morris perceived these new tobacco control initiatives as a threat and conceived strategies to circumvent the government policies. Another incentive for the tobacco industry to protect its military market was the recognized phenomenon that consumer product preferences developed during years serving in the military would later translate into civilian market profits as service members left the military or retired. After the implementation of Directive 1010.10 in 1986, the Tobacco Institute and Philip Morris immediately began seeking the support of tobacco-friendly politicians against the policy, citing that the policy would have a negative impact on military recruitment, retention, and morale. Furthermore, letters sent to Secretary of Defense Weinberger from politicians invoked rhetoric about the infringement of \\"personal rights\\" and \\"an individual's right to smoke.\\" Such political lobbying helped to limit the implementation and the further extension of Directive 1010.10. Although the Department of Defense had discontinued the practice of free distribution of cigarettes during wartime, tobacco companies began campaigns during the Gulf War (1990-1991) to distribute free cigarettes to soldiers stationed in Saudi Arabia, but would eventually be rebuffed by the Department of Defense. Regardless, Philip Morris then began a campaign of sales through direct mail, and extended promotions to deployed troops that included the delivery of branded goods such as playing cards and cup cozies. Curiously enough, the military actually assisted the tobacco companies in delivering shipments to military stores in Saudi Arabia at government expense. Another controversy arose when it was discovered that RJ Reynolds had placed their company name on the front and a Camel advertisement on the back of donated magazines from Operation Desert News, a civilian project to bring magazines to the troops. In spite of the initial rejection by the Department of Defense due to the advertisement, constant pressure from RJ Reynolds and politicians allowed the magazines to be delivered with the advertisement at government expense, violating military policy that forbade tobacco-branded promotions directed at military personnel. In addition, Philip Morris focused on promoting the Marlboro brand with the goal of fostering corporate good will by initiating the \\"Marlboro holiday voice card\\" program. Held on 10 military bases, they invited family of deployed personnel to record a message for onto a chip inserted into a greeting card, and later allowed bases to extend the recording of such messages to the public. Despite being in violation of Department of Defense policy concerning tobacco-branded programs directed at military personnel, Philip Morris had received permission to carry out the program from the Defense Logistics Agency, the Morale, Welfare and Recreation headquarters of the services, and base commanders. Furthermore, after troops were withdrawn from the conflict in 1991, tobacco companies sponsored \\"Welcome Home\\" events for returning troops featuring extensive brand promotion. Although the Department of Defense had enacted policies to reduce tobacco use amongst personnel, the successful efforts of tobacco companies as well as the cultural factors of smoking in the military have produced a mixed message of tobacco promotion and reduction to military personnel. Present-day smoking in the US military Naval Health Clinic, Hawaii, 2010. Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay Medical Clinic, 2010. In 2005, the smoking rate of military personnel was found to be 32.2%, compared to the civilian rate of 21%. The higher smoking rate suggests that certain aspects of military may foster smoking. These factors include the demographic most likely to volunteer for service (ie those who enter the service are more likely to already be smokers), peer influence, combat stress, boredom, and easy access to cheap tobacco products. Another factor that may lead to increased tobacco use is deployment. One study found that among nonsmokers, smoking initiation was observed in 1.3% of nondeployed personnel while 2.3% were observed in deployed personnel. Among past smokers, resumption of smoking occurred in 28.7% of non deployed personnel and 39.4% of deployed personnel, while smoking increased 44% among the former and 57% among the latter. US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan have been reported to smoke at twice the rate of other Americans. Even after leaving the service, many veterans continue to smoke as the prevalence of smoking among veterans has been reported to be 27% during 2003 to 2007, and military smoking is strongly associated with increased lifelong cigarette consumption. Such high levels of smoking have led to significant costs to the Department of Defense. The costs of smoking among US military health care system beneficiaries have been estimated to be more than $900 million per year in 1995, with $584 million in direct health care costs and $346 million in lost productivity among active duty personnel. Suicide, which accounts for 13% of fatalities in the military, has also been tied to smoking, as the risk of suicide among military men was found to increase significantly with the number of cigarettes smoked daily. Smoking also affects training costs as smokers are more likely to be discharged during training, and are associated with $18 million per year in excess training costs for the US Air Force, and over $130 million per year for all service branches. Note that the figures regarding smoking and suicide and manpower losses during training may represent more of a symptomatic relationship than a causative one. Many discharges during basic training result from a series of minor infractions, punished administratively as opposed to by courts-martial, which are seen as an indicator that the trainee cannot or will not adjust to military life, rather than any single incident or serious violation of regulations. With smoking now prohibited in basic training, being caught smoking, and perhaps even being caught in the possession of cigarettes, is such an offense which smokers are obviously at risk for while non smokers are not. Regarding suicide, the figures showing increased rates of smoking and resumption of smoking among those deployed indicates that smoking may be a reaction to and indicator or increased stress, and a person who is potentially suicidal would obviously be under a more than typical degree of stress, so increased smoking may be an indicator of that excessive stress rather than a cause for increased risk of suicide. Also, a higher rate of smoking among those discharged during training may also be indicative of individuals for whom training is more than normally stressful, and such persons would likely experience more difficulty in successfully completing training than one who is not unusually (compared to his/her peers) stressed by it. In 2008 unauthorized smoking and improper storage of chemicals caused major damage to USS George Washington (CVN-73). The Department of Defense hoped to lower rates of tobacco use to 12% by the end of 2010. To achieve their goal, Pentagon health experts urged then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates to ban the use of tobacco by troops and end its sale on military property. The Navy implemented a ban on smoking in submarines by the end of 2010 – highlighting one of the last loopholes in the indoor smoking ban imposed in 1994.

On his capacity as majority floor leader and party stalwart, he claims to be partly responsible for the economic turnaround caused by the Ramos Administration. Some of the major bills that he sponsored are the following: Republic Act No. 8424. Better known as The Comprehensive Tax Reform Program (CTRP). Millions of Filipino wage earners would receive significant tax breaks starting tax year 1998. Through this law, impoverished taxpayers could save up to one-month's take-home pay due to increased tax exemption levels. Also benefiting from this measure are millions of Overseas Filipino Workers whose income earned outside the Philippines would be totally exempt from taxes. Republic Act No. 8435. Also known as the Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization Act, RA 8485 allocates P120 billion spread over a period of seven years to finance various infrastructure projects and credit facilities for farmers and fisherfolk. Of this total, P6 billion would go to various irrigation projects throughout the country. This is the biggest allocation in the law, which aims to enhance agriculture production even with the onset of the El Niño phenomenon. Congressman Diaz has also marshaled support for the construction of the P16 billion (US$400 million) Casecnan tunnel, dam and power generation plant. This project will not only irrigate year round the 100,000 hectares of agricultural land under the Upper Pampanga River System (UPRIS) but an additional 53,000 hectares of new area mostly in the First District of Nueva Ecija as well. It would also generate 300 megawatts of electricity.

News of the incident received publicity in July, 2010 after Miller's daughter, Shirley Sherrod, revealed her version of the events shortly after the controversy surrounding her resignation as Georgia State Director of Rural Development for the United States Department of Agriculture. Sherrod reported that Miller, who owned in Baker County, Georgia on which he grew corn, cotton and peanuts, would sometimes argue with Hall, whose cows would wander into her family's pasture. She said that Hall confronted Miller about six or seven cows the Miller claimed belonged to him. According to Sherrod, when Miller told Hall that they could settle the matter in court, Hall shot Miller in front of three witnesses. The shooting occurred on the night of March 15, 1965 and, according to the death certificate, Miller died on March 25 from gunshot wounds to his chest, abdomen and liver. Hall, who claimed he killed Miller in self-defense, was charged at least three times in connection with Miller's death and a grand jury declined to prosecute him each time. Civil rights attorney C.B. King represented the Miller family in a civil suit against Hall seeking monetary damages for lost income, medical, and funeral costs. King, asserting that the jury panel was predominately white despite the 1960 census showing that the majority of the county's over 2,000 residents were black, attempted to have the Baker County Board of Jury Commissioners redraw jury lists. Judge Emeritus Carl E. Crow went forward with the proceedings and on September 12, 1966, the jury found in favor of Hall. Grace Miller, Hosie Miller's wife, said she was distantly related to Hall.

She later married Harold Bean, a soldier in the Royal Army Service Corps who briefly served in North Africa. After Harold left the army, he and Ivy went to work in service for the Lord and Lady Guinness at Greens Norton Hall in Northampton. It was during their time there that they had their only daughter, Sandra. After several years in Bedford, the family returned to Bradford and Bean began working for Arthur Crossland, a local mill owner. She had worked for Crossland for about 18 years when he died and she decided it was time to retire. A few months later, she began working for her former boss' daughter. Several years later, Bean retired for the second time, aged 73, a little while after her husband Harold died, aged 75. She would remain on her own until the age of 92, when she moved into a residential home, where she remained for ten years, until the home closed down and she moved into another care facility, just one week before her 102nd birthday. Later years and fame In 2007 she first accessed the internet via a computer given by social services to her care home. In 2008, at the age of 102, Bean joined Facebook, making her one of its oldest members. An inspiration to other residents, she quickly became more widely known, and several fan pages were made in her honour. Bean discussed her life in a care home, her favourite meal, and episodes of Deal or No Deal she had seen. Singer Peter Andre had a private meeting with Bean in September 2009 while in Bradford for a book signing. She visited Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his wife Sarah in Downing Street early in 2010. Some time after creating her Facebook page, Bean also joined Twitter, when she passed the maximum number of friends allowed by Facebook. At the time of her death, she had 4,962 friends on Facebook and more than 56,000 followers on Twitter. It is also known that her Facebook account is disabled. Illness and death In early July 2010, staff at Bean's care home reported on her Twitter account that she had been admitted to hospital, but that she was in good spirits and would be back online as soon as her health allowed. A week later it was reported that she was suffering from liver failure. On 23 July, Bean returned home but her condition worsened and at 12:08 am on 28 July, she died at the age of 104. Admirers Stephen Fry and Graham Linehan were saddened by the news. Family Bean was married to Harold Bean (d. 1978), and never remarried after he died. She had a daughter, Sandra.

It was also the official offering of the celebration of 60 Years of Pinoy Soap Opera. Plot =Book One: Epilogue= Right before the big feud between the Fortalejo and De Silva families, Alicia De Silva was deeply in love with Don Leon Fortalejo. Don Leon, already married to Kristine Esmeralda Lopez- Fortalejo, refused to be with her until one night when Alicia sneaked in his bedroom. That mistake lead to being pregnant and Ernesto De Silva (Alicia's father) calling it \\"disgracing the family\\". Since Alicia lied about Romano Fortalejo (Don Leon's favorite child) being the father of her child, the two business partners, Don Leon and Ernesto arranged a marriage for their children. Romano and Ana Marie Soriano, being in love together, escaped to live their own lives while leaving Alicia at the altar on the day of their marriage. This enraged Ernesto to a fight causing his life and Don Leon's left arm. Alfon De Silva, Ernesto oldest son seeking for revenge raped and killed Esmeralda. Due to the pain of losing his wife, Don Leon announced the feud and disowning Romano.'' Years later, Romano and Ana bore two children, Kristine Emerald Fortalejo and Kristine Jewel Fortalejo (not knowing of the feud). Romano died leaving a lot of hospital bills. A penny away to being poor, Ana told the whole story about their background telling her children to never take the inheritance left by Esmeralda. Emerald, not listening drove to Villa Kristine to receive the inheritance but accidentally drove to the Hacienda De Silva. There she met Marco De Silva who kidnapped her but later fell deeply in love with each other. Jewel almost dying of worry for her sister, went to Paso De Blas hoping to find Emerald. There, she met Jamie Reyes in a funny way and pretended to be his wife to be accepted in the Hacienda De Silva as a worker. Many days past of working in the sun and finding Emerald, but Jewel and Jamie fell in love with each other. After many conflicts with Alfon, Don Cesar Zaragoza, and Don Leon the Fortalejo family was reunited. Marco and Emerald were also broken hearted because a certain deal with Don Leon and Julia De Silva were made. Emerald vowed to be an enemy to Marco. Marco still tries to clear his name and prove that Margarita Fortalejo is a murderer. Although Don Leon wants Lance for Jewel instead of Jamie, his driver, many escapes by Jewel and Jamie were planned to be with each other. But when Don Leon learned that his son, Bernard Fortalejo is alive, he tries hard to find the lovers. Bernard Fortalejo was revealed to be Jamie Reyes a fact that will ruin Jewel and Jamie's lives. Meanwhile, Alfon De Silva showed up in a bar in Paso De Blas where Margarita was drinking, and made a deal to be partners.

Edward Alexander (b. Charles Edward Alexander Hedger, 18 September 1980, Colchester, Essex/ Guitars, Vocals, Orchestration), and David Bryan (Bass, Lyrics). The band's musical style embraces aspects of symphonic black metal and other extreme metal genres, with lyrical themes and imagery largely influenced by the British Empire period. After issuing a self-released four-track EP in early 2008 entitled \\"Death: August and Royal\\" the band signed a deal with Candlelight Records, and released their debut album \\"At The Going Down Of The Sun\\" in July 2009. The album's title track was also to feature spoken word from Harry Patch, providing extracts from Laurence Binyon's For the Fallen. During the following September, the band issued a video of the track \\"6th Airborne Division\\" which revealed a live line up of additional members consisting of Elle Torry- guitar, James Murray- Guitar, and James Last- Drums. Gigs followed, a notable appearance being at the Hellfire Festival at Birmingham's NEC. The band followed this with an EP that featured a cover of Madness 1979 song Night Boat to Cairo with a suitably eccentric video to accompany the release, inked a management deal with Rob Ferguson of Transcend Management, and moved labels from Candlelight in favour of the Transcend Music Group. 2010 saw the band begin outlining ideas for a second album, and in July issued a DVD that not only featured videos for both \\"6th Airborne Division\\" and \\"Night Boat to Cairo\\", but also included the filmed footage of the recording session with Harry Patch It was also announced that the title for this next work would be \\"Black Heart Of Empire\\" and would feature an appearance from the soprano Lori Lewis (Therion). A Penny dreadful style publication was issued in conjunction with the album. The band released Black Heart of Empire on 28 September 2011. Other artists that make appearances on the album include Therion soprano Lori Lewis, Vulture Industries vocalist, Bjørnar Erevik Nilsen, and Dave Courtney providing \\"the Voice of Old London.\\" The album was recorded and engineered by C. Edward Alexander and mastered by Russ Russell.

The reforms were started by reformists within the Chinese Communist Party—led by Deng Xiaoping—on December 18, 1978, during the \\"Boluan Fanzheng\\" period. They went into stagnation after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, but were revived after Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour in 1992. In 2010, China overtook Japan as the world's second-largest economy. Before the reforms, the Chinese economy was dominated by state ownership and central planning. From 1950 to 1973, Chinese real GDP per capita grew at a rate of 2.9% per year on average, albeit with major fluctuations stemming from the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. This placed it near the middle of the Asian nations during the same period, with neighboring capitalist countries such as Japan, South Korea and rival Chiang Kai-shek's Republic of China outstripping the PRC's rate of growth. Starting in 1970, the economy entered into a period of stagnation, and after the death of Mao Zedong, the Communist Party leadership turned to market-oriented reforms to salvage the failing economy. The Communist Party authorities carried out the market reforms in two stages. The first stage, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, involved the de-collectivization of agriculture, the opening up of the country to foreign investment, and permission for entrepreneurs to start businesses. However, a large percentage of industries remained state-owned. The second stage of reform, in the late 1980s and 1990s, involved the privatization and contracting out of much state-owned industry. The 1985 lifting of price controls was a major reform, and protectionist policies and regulations soon followed, although state monopolies in sectors such as banking and petroleum remained. In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). The private sector grew remarkably, accounting for as much as 70 percent of China's gross domestic product by 2005. From 1978 until 2013, unprecedented growth occurred, with the economy increasing by 9.5% a year. The conservative Hu Jintao's administration regulated and controlled the economy more heavily after 2005, reversing some reforms. On the other hand, a parallel set of political reforms were launched by Deng in 1980, but eventually ended in 1989 due to the Tiananmen Square protests. The success of China's economic policies and the manner of their implementation resulted in immense changes in Chinese society in the last 40 years, including greatly decreased poverty while both average incomes and income inequality have increased, leading to a backlash led by the New Left. In the academic scene, scholars have debated the reason for the success of the Chinese \\"dual-track\\" economy, and have compared it to attempts to reform socialism in the Eastern Bloc and the Soviet Union; as well as to the growth of other developing economies. Additionally, these series of reforms have led to China's rise as a world power and a shift of international geopolitical interests in favour of it over Taiwan. The reform era has been said to end during the leadership of Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping, who generally opposes the reforms and has rolled back many of the Deng-era reforms as the Communist Party reasserts control over different aspects of Chinese society, including the economy. In 2018, sinologist Minxin Pei argued that the Chinese economy is currently the least open since the reform era began in the 1980s. This de-liberalization is seen by one Hong Kong commentator as part of the subject of the present US–China trade war, in which the United States alleges the Chinese government is giving unfair and discriminatory competitive advantages to Chinese state-owned and private companies. Course of reforms = Origin = In September 1976, Mao Zedong died, and in October, Hua Guofeng together with Ye Jianying and Wang Dongxing arrested the Gang of Four, putting an end to the Cultural Revolution. Economic reforms began during the \\"Boluan Fanzheng\\" period, especially after Deng Xiaoping and his reformist allies rose to power with Deng replacing Hua Guofeng as the paramount leader of China in December 1978. By the time Deng took power, there was widespread support among the elite for economic reforms. As the de facto leader, Deng's policies faced opposition from party conservatives but were extremely successful in increasing the country's wealth. =1979–1984= The image of Deng Xiaoping in 250x250px In 1979, Deng Xiaoping emphasized the goal of \\"Four Modernizations\\" and further proposed the idea of \\"xiaokang\\", or \\"moderately prosperous society\\". The achievements of Lee Kuan Yew to create an economic superpower in Singapore had a profound effect on the Communist leadership in China. Leaders in China made a major effort, especially under Deng Xiaoping, to emulate his policies of economic growth, entrepreneurship, and subtle suppression of dissent. Over the years, more than 22,000 Chinese officials were sent to Singapore to study its methods.Chris Buckley, \\"In Lee Kuan Yew, China Saw a Leader to Emulate,\\" New York Times March 23, 2015 Deng's first reforms began in agriculture, a sector long mismanaged by the Chinese Communist Party. By the late 1970s, food supplies and production had become so deficient that government officials were warning that China was about to repeat the \\"disaster of 1959\\", the famines which killed tens of millions during the Great Leap Forward. Deng responded by decollectivizing agriculture and emphasizing the household-responsibility system, which divided the land of the People's communes into private plots. Under the new policy, peasants were able to exercise formal control of their land as long as they sold a contracted portion of their crops to the government. This move increased agricultural production by 25 percent between 1975 and 1985, setting a precedent for privatizing other parts of the economy. The bottom-up approach of the reforms promoted by Deng, in contrast to the top-down approach of the Perestroika in the Soviet Union, is considered an important factor contributing to the success of China's economic transition.Cited by Susan L. Shirk in The Political Logic of Economic Reform in China, University of California, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1993. Reforms were also implemented in urban industry to increase productivity. A dual-price system was introduced, in which (State-owned enterprise reform 1979) state- owned industries were allowed to sell any production above the plan quota, and commodities were sold at both plan and market prices, allowing citizens to avoid the shortages of the Maoist era. Moreover, the adoption of Industrial Responsibility System 1980s further promote the development of state-owned enterprise by allowing individuals or groups to manage the enterprise by contract. Private businesses were allowed to operate for the first time since the Communist takeover, and they gradually began to make up a greater percentage of industrial output. Price flexibility was also increased, expanding the service sector. At the same time, in December 1978, Deng announced a new policy, the Open Door Policy, to open the door to foreign businesses that wanted to set up in China. For the first time since the Kuomintang era, the country was opened to foreign investment. Deng created a series of Special Economic Zones, including Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Xiamen, for foreign investment that were relatively free of the bureaucratic regulations and interventions that hampered economic growth. These regions became engines of growth for the national economy. On January 31, 1979, the Shekou Industrial Zone of Shenzhen was founded, becoming the first experimental area in China to \\"open up\\". Under the leadership of Yuan Geng, the \\"Shekou model\\" of development was gradually formed, embodied in its famous slogan \\"Time is Money, Efficiency is Life\\", which then widely spread to other parts of China. In January 1984, Deng Xiaoping made his first inspection tour to Shenzhen and Zhuhai, praising the \\"Shenzhen Speed\\" of development as well as the success of the special economics zones. =1984–1993= Shenzhen, one of the first special economic zones of China and the \\"Silicon Valley of China\\". Notable high-tech companies such as Huawei, ZTE and Konka were all founded in Shenzhen in the 1980s. During this period, Deng Xiaoping's policies continued beyond the initial reforms. Controls on private businesses and government intervention continued to decrease, notably in the agrifood sector which saw relaxation of price controls in 1985, and there was small-scale privatization of state enterprises which had become unviable. A notable development was the decentralization of state control, leaving local provincial leaders to experiment with ways to increase economic growth and privatize the state sector. Township and village enterprises, firms nominally owned by local governments but effectively private, began to gain market share at the expense of the state sector. With the help of Yuan Geng, the first joint-stock commercial bank in China, the China Merchants Bank, and the first joint-stock insurance company in China, the Ping An Insurance, were both established in Shekou. In May 1984, fourteen coastal cities in China including Shanghai, Guangzhou and Tianjin were named \\"Open Coastal Cities (沿海开放城市)\\". Time is money, Efficiency is life\\" from Shekou, Shenzhen, representing the \\"Shenzhen speed\\". On the other hand, conservative elder opposition, led by Chen Yun, prevented many major reforms which would have damaged the interests of special interest groups in the government bureaucracy. Corruption and increased inflation increased discontent, contributing to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and a conservative backlash after that event which ousted several key reformers and threatened to reverse many of Deng's reforms. However, Deng stood by his reforms and in 1992, he affirmed the need to continue reforms in his southern tour. He also reopened the Shanghai Stock Exchange in November 1990 which was closed by Mao 40 years earlier, while the Shenzhen Stock Exchange was founded in December 1990. Although the economy grew quickly during this period, economic troubles in the inefficient state sector increased. Heavy losses had to be made up by state revenues and acted as a drain upon the economy. Inflation became problematic in 1985, 1988 and 1992. Privatizations began to accelerate after 1992, and the private sector grew as a percentage of GDP. China's government slowly expanded recognition of the private economy, first as a \\"complement\\" to the state sector (1988) and then as an \\"important component\\" (1999) of the socialist market economy. =1993–2005= The alt= In the 1990s, Deng forced many of the conservative elders such as Chen Yun into retirement, allowing radical reforms to be carried out. Despite Deng's death in 1997, reforms continued under his handpicked successors, Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji, who were ardent reformers. In 1997 and 1998, large-scale privatization occurred, in which all state enterprises, except a few large monopolies, were liquidated and their assets sold to private investors. Between 2001 and 2004, the number of state-owned enterprises decreased by 48 percent. During the same period, Jiang and Zhu also reduced tariffs, trade barriers, and regulations; reformed the banking system; dismantled much of the Mao-era social welfare system; forced the Chinese army (PLA) to divest itself of military-run businesses; reduced inflation; and joined the World Trade Organization. These moves invoked discontent among some groups, especially laid-off workers of state enterprises that had been privatized. The domestic private sector first exceeded 50% of GDP in 2005 and has further expanded since. Also in 2005, China was able to surpass Japan as the largest economy in Asia. However, some state monopolies still remained, such as in petroleum and banking.\\"China names key industries for state control\\" , China Daily, (2006) =2005–2012= Hu Jintao and his conservative administration began to reverse some of Deng Xiaoping's reforms in 2005. Observers note that the government adopted more egalitarian and populist policies. It increased subsidies and control over the health care sector,\\"China's New Healthcare could cover millions more\\" , Time magazine. halted privatization, and adopted a loose monetary policy, which led to the formation of a U.S.-style property bubble in which property prices tripled.Chovanec, Patrick (2009-06-08). \\"China's Real Estate Riddle\\" . Far East Economic Review. Retrieved 13 March 2010. The privileged state sector was the primary recipient of government investment, which under the new administration, promoted the rise of large \\"national champions\\" which could compete with large foreign corporations. China would finally surpass Japan's economy in 2010.https://www.bbc.com/news/business-12427321 =2012–present= Under Party general secretary Xi Jinping and his administration, the CCP has sought to increase its control over state-owned and private enterprises. At least 288 firms have revised their corporate charters to allow the Communist Party greater influence in corporate management, and to reflect the party line. This trend also includes Hong Kong listed firms, who have traditionally downplayed their party links, but are now \\"redrafting bylaws to formally establish party committees that previously existed only at the group level.\\" On 21 July 2020, the general secretary of China Communist Party, Xin Jinping made a speech to a group of public and private business leaders at the entrepreneur forum in Beijing. Xi emphasized that “We must gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic internal circulation as the main body and the domestic and international dual circulations mutually promoting each other.” Since then “internal circulation” became a hot word in China. Some Chinese worry that the emphasis of “internal circulation” signals returning to 1960s-era seclusion, and ending of Chinese economic reform. In September 2020, the CCP announced that it would strengthen United Front work in the private sector by establishing more party committees in the regional federations of industry and commerce (FIC), and by arranging a special liaison between FIC and the CCP.  Effects of the reforms  =Economic performance= GDP trend from 1952 to 2015. Note the rapid increase since reform in the late 1970s. After three decades of reform, China's economy experienced one of the world's biggest booms. Agriculture and light industry have largely been privatized, while the state still retains control over some heavy industries. Despite the dominance of state ownership in finance, telecommunications, petroleum and other important sectors of the economy, private entrepreneurs continue to expand into sectors formerly reserved for public enterprise. Prices have also been liberalized. China's economic growth since the reform has been very rapid, exceeding the East Asian Tigers. Since the beginning of Deng Xiaoping's reforms, China's GDP has risen tenfold.China has socialist market economy in place (People's Daily Online, 2005). The increase in total factor productivity (TFP) was the most important factor, with productivity accounting for 40.1% of the GDP increase, compared with a decline of 13.2% for the period 1957 to 1978—the height of Maoist policies. For the period 1978–2005, Chinese GDP per capita increased from 2.7% to 15.7% of U.S. GDP per capita, and from 53.7% to 188.5% of Indian GDP per capita. Per capita incomes grew at 6.6% a year. Average wages rose sixfold between 1978 and 2005, while absolute poverty declined from 41% of the population to 5% from 1978 to 2001. Some scholars believed that China's economic growth has been understated, due to large sectors of the economy not being counted. =Impact on world growth= China is widely seen as an engine of world and regional growth. Surges in Chinese demand account for 50, 44 and 66 percent of export growth of the Hong Kong SAR of China, Japan and Taiwan respectively, and China's trade deficit with the rest of East Asia helped to revive the economies of Japan and Southeast Asia. Asian leaders view China's economic growth as an \\"engine of growth for all Asia\\". =Effect on inequality= thumb350px Gini-coefficient of national income distribution around the world (dark green: <0.25, red: >0.60)alt= The economic reforms have increased inequality dramatically within China. Despite rapid economic growth which has virtually eliminated poverty in urban China and reduced it greatly in rural regions and the fact that living standards for everyone in China have drastically increased in comparison to the pre-reform era, the Gini coefficient of China is estimated to be above 0.45, comparable to some Latin American countries and the United States. Increased inequality is attributed to the disappearance of the welfare state and differences between coastal and interior provinces, the latter being burdened by a larger state sector. Some Western scholars have suggested that reviving the welfare state and instituting a re-distributive income tax system is needed to relieve inequality, while some Chinese economists have suggested that privatizing state monopolies and distributing the proceeds to the population can reduce inequality.Weiyin, Zhang, \\"Completely bury Keynesianism\\" , (February 17, 2009) Reforms in specific sectors =Agriculture= Production of wheat from 1961 to 2004. Data from FAO, year 2005. Y-axis: Production in metric ton. During the pre-reform period, Chinese agricultural performance was extremely poor and food shortages were common. After Deng Xiaoping implemented the household responsibility system, agricultural output increased by 8.2% a year, compared with 2.7% in the pre-reform period, despite a decrease in the area of land used. Food prices fell nearly 50%, while agricultural incomes rose. A more fundamental transformation was the economy's growing adoption of cash crops instead of just growing rice and grain. Vegetable and meat production increased to the point that Chinese agricultural production was adding the equivalent of California's vegetable industry every two years. Growth in the sector slowed after 1984, with agriculture falling from 40% of GDP to 16%; however, increases in agricultural productivity allowed workers to be released for work in industry and services, while simultaneously increasing agricultural production. Trade in agriculture was also liberalized and China became an exporter of food, a great contrast to its previous famines and shortages. =Industry= In the pre-reform period, industry was largely stagnant and the socialist system presented few incentives for improvements in quality and productivity. With the introduction of the dual-price system and greater autonomy for enterprise managers, productivity increased greatly in the early 1980s. Foreign enterprises and newly formed Township and Village Enterprises, owned by local government and often de facto private firms, competed successfully with state-owned enterprises. By the 1990s, large-scale privatizations reduced the market share of both the Township and Village Enterprises and state-owned enterprises and increased the private sector's market share. The state sector's share of industrial output dropped from 81% in 1980 to 15% in 2005. Foreign capital controls much of Chinese industry and plays an important role. From virtually an industrial backwater in 1978, China is now the world's biggest producer of concrete, steel, ships and textiles, and has the world's largest automobile market. Chinese steel output quadrupled between 1980 and 2000, and from 2000 to 2006 rose from 128.5 million tons to 418.8 million tons, one-third of global production. Labor productivity at some Chinese steel firms exceeds Western productivity. From 1975 to 1992, China's automobile production rose from 139,800 to 1.1 million, rising to 9.35 million in 2008.\\"China poised to be world’s largest auto market\\" . NBC News. 2009-02-04. Light industries such as textiles saw an even greater increase, due to reduced government interference. Chinese textile exports increased from 4.6% of world exports in 1980 to 24.1% in 2005. Textile output increased 18-fold over the same period. This increase in production is largely the result of the removal of barriers to entry and increased competition; the number of industrial firms rose from 377,300 in 1980 to nearly 8 million in 1990 and 1996; the 2004 economic census, which excluded enterprises with annual sales below RMB 5 million, counted 1.33 million manufacturing firms, with Jiangsu and Zhejiang reporting more firms than the nationwide total for 1980. Compared to other East Asian industrial growth spurts, China's industrial performance exceeded Japan's but remained behind South Korea and Taiwan's economies. =Trade and foreign investment= Global distribution of Chinese exports in 2006 as a percentage of the top market Some scholars assert that China has maintained a high degree of openness that is unusual among the other large and populous nations, with competition from foreign goods in almost every sector of the economy. Foreign investment helped to greatly increase quality, knowledge and standards, especially in heavy industry. China's experience supports the assertion that globalization greatly increases wealth for poor countries. Throughout the reform period, the government reduced tariffs and other trade barriers, with the overall tariff rate falling from 56% to 15%. By 2001, less than 40% of imports were subject to tariffs and only 9 percent of import were subject to licensing and import quotas. Even during the early reform era, protectionist policies were often circumvented by smuggling. When China joined the WTO, it agreed to considerably harsher conditions than other developing countries. Trade has increased from under 10% of GDP to 64% of GDP over the same period. China is considered the most open large country; by 2005, China's average statutory tariff on industrial products was 8.9%. The average was 30.9% for Argentina, 27.0% for Brazil, 32.4% for India, and 36.9% for Indonesia. China's trade surplus is considered by some in the United States as threatening American jobs. In the 2000s, the Bush administration pursued protectionist policies such as tariffs and quotas to limit the import of Chinese goods. Some scholars argue that China's growing trade surplus is the result of industries in more developed Asian countries moving to China, and not a new phenomenon. China's trade policy, which allows producers to avoid paying the Value Added Tax (VAT) for exports and undervaluation of the currency since 2002, has resulted in an overdeveloped export sector and distortion of the economy overall, a result that could hamper future growth. Foreign investment was also liberalized upon Deng's ascension. Special Economic Zones (SEZs) were created in the early 1980s to attract foreign capital by exempting them from taxes and regulations. This experiment was successful and SEZs were expanded to cover the whole Chinese coast. Although FDI fell briefly after the 1989 student protests, it increased again to 160 billion by 2004. =Services= Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) In the 1990s, the financial sector was liberalized.Haggard, Stevens et al (2008), 339 After China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO), the service sector was considerably liberalized and foreign investment was allowed; restrictions on retail, wholesale and distribution ended. Banking, financial services, insurance and telecommunications were also opened up to foreign investment. China's banking sector is dominated by four large state-owned banks, which are largely inefficient and monopolistic. China's largest bank, ICBC, is the largest bank in the world. The financial sector is widely seen as a drag on the economy due to the inefficient state management. Non-performing loans, mostly made to local governments and unprofitable state-owned enterprises for political purposes, especially the political goal of keeping unemployment low, are a big drain on the financial system and economy, reaching over 22% of GDP by 2000, with a drop to 6.3% by 2006 due to government recapitalization of these banks. In 2006, the total amount of non-performing loans was estimated at $160 billion. Observers recommend privatization of the banking system to solve this problem, a move that was partially carried out when the four banks were floated on the stock market. China's financial markets, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange, are relatively ineffective at raising capital, as they comprise only 11% of GDP. Due to the weakness of the banks, firms raise most of their capital through an informal, nonstandard financial sector developed during the 1980s and 1990s, consisting largely of underground businesses and private banks. Internal finance is the most important method successful firms use to fund their activities. By the 1980s much emphasis was placed on the role of advertising in meeting the modernization goals being promoted by Deng. Lip service was still paid to old Maoist ideals of egalitarianism, but it did not inhibit the growth of consumerism.Xin Zhao and Russell W. Belk, \\"Politicizing Consumer Culture: Advertising's Appropriation of Political Ideology in China's Social Transition,\\" Journal of Consumer Research (2008) 35#2 pp 231-244 =Government finances= In the pre-reform era, government was funded by profits from state-owned enterprises, much like the Soviet Union. As the state sector fell in importance and profitability, government revenues, especially that of the central government in Beijing, fell substantially and the government relied on a confused system of inventory taxes. Government revenues fell from 35% of GDP to 11% of GDP in the mid-1990s, excluding revenue from state-owned enterprises, with the central government's budget at just 3% of GDP. The tax system was reformed in 1994 when inventory taxes were unified into a single VAT of 17% on all manufacturing, repair, and assembly activities and an excise tax on 11 items, with the VAT becoming the main income source, accounting for half of government revenue. The 1994 reform also increased the central government's share of revenues, increasing it to 9% of GDP.  Academic studies  =Reasons for success= Discussion of \\"China's Next Global Agenda\\" during the World Economic Forum (2013). Scholars have proposed a number of theories to explain China's successful transition from a planned to a socialist market economy. This occurred despite unfavorable factors such as the troublesome legacies of socialism, considerable erosion of the work ethic, decades of anti-market propaganda, and the \\"lost generation\\" whose education disintegrated amid the disruption of the Cultural Revolution. One notable theory is that decentralization of state authority allowed local leaders to experiment with various ways to privatize the state sector and energize the economy. Although Deng was not the originator of many of the reforms, he approved them. Another theory focuses on internal incentives within the Chinese government, in which officials presiding over areas of high economic growth were more likely to be promoted. This made local and provincial governments \\"hungry for investment,\\" who competed to reduce regulations and barriers to investment to boost both economic growth and their careers. Such reforms were possible because Deng cultivated pro-market followers in the government. Herman Kahn argued that Confucian ethic was playing a \\"similar but more spectacular role in the modernization of East Asia than the Protestant ethic played in Europe\\". Taken together, Yuen Yuen Ang argues in Foreign Affairs that political reforms took place with economic reforms under Deng, except the former did not take Western forms. She writes, \\"To be sure, Deng's reforms emphasized brute capital accumulation rather than holistic development, which led to environmental degradation, inequality, and other social problems. Still they undoubtedly kicked China's growth machine into gear by making the bureaucracy results oriented, fiercely competitive, and responsive to business needs, qualities that are normally associated with democracies.\\" But this only applies to the Deng era. Ang notes that since 2012, when Xi Jinping took over, the new leader has reversed Deng's political reforms and limits to power, \\"just as political freedoms have become imperative for continued economic growth.\\" Roberto Azevêdo, Director-General of WTO, met with China’s Minister of Commerce Gao Hucheng in Qingdao (2014). China's success is also due to the export-led growth strategy used successfully by the Four Asian Tigers beginning with Japan in the 1960s–1970s and other Newly industrialized countries. In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). As of 2006, over 400 of the Fortune 500 companies had entered the Chinese market, while at the same time a considerable number of Chinese companies had opened their markets outside of China. Foreign aids to China, including those from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, also played an important role. Since the beginning of opening, China has received a significant amount of aid from major developed countries such as the United States, Japan, Germany, France and the United Kingdom. For instance, through its Official Development Assistance (ODA), Japan had offered China various forms of assistance worth 3.65 trillion Yen as of 2018. On the other hand, the assistance from the U.S. reached a total of US$556 million as of 2012, and has \\"helped Tibetan communities improve livelihoods, promote sustainable development and environmental conservation, and preserve cultural traditions...also supports targeted programs that strengthen cooperation on combatting the spread of HIV/AIDS and other pandemic and emerging diseases as well as rule of law programs.\\" The collapse of the Soviet Bloc and centrally planned economies in 1989 provided renewed impetus for China to further reform its economy through different policies in order to avoid a similar fate. China also wanted to avoid the Russian ad-hoc experiments with market capitalism under Boris Yeltsin resulting in the rise of powerful oligarchs, corruption, and the loss of state revenue which exacerbated economic disparity. =Comparison to other developing economies= Indian GDP (1950–2010) China's transition from a planned economy to a socialist market economy has often been compared with economies in Eastern Europe that are undergoing a similar transition. China's performance has been praised for avoiding the major shocks and inflation that plagued the Eastern Bloc. The Eastern bloc economies saw declines of 13% to 65% in GDP at the beginning of reforms, while Chinese growth has been very strong since the beginning of reform. China also managed to avoid the hyperinflation of 200 to 1,000% that Eastern Europe experienced. This success is attributed to the gradualist and decentralized approach of the Chinese government, which allowed market institutions to develop to the point where they could replace state planning. This contrasts with the \\"big bang\\" approach of Eastern Europe, where the state-owned sector was rapidly privatized with employee buyouts, but retained much of the earlier, inefficient management. Other factors thought to account for the differences are the greater urbanization of the CIS economies and differences in social welfare and other institutions. Another argument is that, in the Eastern European economies, political change is sometimes seen to have made gradualist reforms impossible, so the shocks and inflation were unavoidable. China's economic growth has been compared with other developing countries, such as Brazil, Mexico, and India. GDP growth in China outstrips all other developing countries, with only India after 1990 coming close to China's experience. Scholars believe that high rates of investments, especially increases in capital invested per worker, have contributed to China's superior economic performance. China's relatively free economy, with less government intervention and regulation, is cited by scholars as an important factor in China's superior performance compared to other developing countries. =Legacy and criticism= The government retains monopolies in several sectors, such as petroleum and banking. The recent reversal of some reforms have left some observers dubbing 2008 the \\"third anniversary of the end of reforms\\". Nevertheless, observers believe that China's economy can continue growing at rates of 6–8 percent until 2025, though a reduction in state intervention is considered by some to be necessary for sustained growth. Despite reducing poverty and increasing China's wealth, Deng's reforms have been criticized by the Chinese New Left for increasing inequality and allowing private entrepreneurs to purchase state assets at reduced prices. These accusations were especially intense during the Lang-Gu dispute, in which New Left academic Larry Lang accused entrepreneur Gu Sujung of usurping state assets, after which Gu was imprisoned.\\"The Lang-Gu debate: a debate that has not yet ended\\" , 30 October 2008 The Hu-Wen Administration adopted some New Left policies, such as halting privatizations and increasing the state sector's importance in the economy, and Keynesian policies that have been criticized by some Chinese economists who advocate a policy of deregulation, tax cuts and privatization. Other criticisms focus on the effects of rapid industrialization on public health and the environment. However, scholars believe that public health issues are unlikely to become major obstacles to the growth of China's economy during the coming decades, and studies have shown that air quality and other environmental measures in China are better than those in developed countries, such as the United States and Japan, at the same level of development.

First conceptualized in 2004 by the CEO of MAC Architects-Consultants Group Ltd., Mr. Soon Jo Lee, DAAM is currently undergoing construction after having its groundbreaking ceremony on December 21, 2009 and having received its architectural permit on June 23, 2010. The Grand Opening of DAAM is projected to be in 2013.  Concept of the apple  Apples have long been a theme used to depict ambition as well as innovation. Examples of this could be seen many times throughout history, such as the forbidden apple from The Garden of Eden, the apple from Snow White, Newton's discovery of gravity through the falling apple, the Swiss folk story of Wilhelm Tell and the apple placed on his son's head and even New York City, often dubbed the Big Apple. Following the long traditions of apples being used as a symbol for such historical advances, the theme of the building will be based on the theme of an apple as well. The building will feature two main sections: the apple core and the apple peel with each part having a different purpose.  Building facilities  DAAM will cover roughly 2.5 million square feet (~235,000 m2), with 7 above-ground floors on both the apple core part and the apple peel part respectively. It will contain 7 underground floors to be used as parking facilities as well as storage facilities. The other building facilities are: * 1,100 luxury hotel suites * 500 atelier units * 100 gallery and museum units * 2,500 seating capacity concert hall * 350 dormitory units * 18 restaurants * 1,000 seating capacity cafeteria * Library * 380 residential studio units * 33,000 m2 of public area * 6,000 m2 of sports facilities * 3,600 m2 of spa facilities * 300m canoe slalom stadium * 1,650 m2 canoe polo stadium  Neo-Bauhausian movement  The Bauhaus of the early 1900s was a school in Germany that combined crafts and the fine arts, and was famous for the approach to design that it publicized and taught. By incorporating art and music classes, along with seminars and lectures given by professionals and professors in their respective industry, DAAM has ambitions of creating a neo-Bauhausian movement. The furthering of the fine arts and the performing arts is to increase the awareness and participation among people of different ages and backgrounds. There are hopes to have international artists come to DAAM to work on their craft while having the capacity for also displaying their works and even having their works put up for sale.

Anthony, in which the author describes his \\"revised Kurgan theory.\\" He explores the origins and spread of the Indo-European languages from the Pontic-Caspian steppe throughout Western Europe, and Central and South Asia. He shows how the domesticated horse and the invention of the wheel mobilized the steppe herding societies in the Eurasian Steppe, and combined with the introduction of bronze technology and new social structures of patron-client relationships gave an advantage to the Indo-European societies. The book won the Society for American Archaeology's 2010 Book Award. Synopsis Anthony gives a broad overview of the linguistic and archaeological evidence for the early origins and spread of the Indo-European languages, describing a revised version of Marija Gimbutas's Kurgan hypothesis. Anthony describes the development of local cultures at the northern Black Sea coast, from hunter- gatherers to herders, under the influence of the Balkan cultures, which introduced cattle, horses and bronze technology. When the climate changed between 3500 and 3000 BCE, with the steppes becoming drier and cooler, those inventions led to a new way of life in which mobile herders moved into the steppes, developing a new kind of social organisation with patron-client and host-guest relationships. That new social organisation, with its related Indo- European languages, spread throughout Europe, Central Asia and South Asia because of its possibilities to include new members within its social structures. Part One covers theoretical considerations on language and archaeology. It gives an introductory overview of Indo-European linguistics (ch. 1); investigates the reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European (ch. 2); the dating of Proto-Indo-European (ch. 3); the specific vocabulary for wool and wheels (ch. 4); the location of the Proto-Indo-European homeland (ch. 5); and the correlation of these linguistic discoveries with archaeological evidence and the role of elite recruitment in language shift (ch. 6). Part Two covers the development of the Steppe cultures and the subsequent migrations out of the Pontic-Caspian region into Europe, Central Asia, and South Asia. The splitting of the major branches of Indo-European (except perhaps Greek) can be correlated with archaeological cultures, showing steppe influences in a way that makes sense chronologically and geographically in light of linguistic reconstructions. Anthony gives an introduction to Part Two (ch. 7); describes the interaction between Balkan farmers and herders and steppe foragers at the Dniestr River (in western Ukraine) and the introduction of cattle (ch. 8); the spread of cattle-herding during the Copper Age and the accompanying social division between high and low status (ch. 9); the domestication of the horse (ch. 10); the end of the Balkan cultures and the early migrations of Steppe people into the Danube Valley (ch. 11); the development of the steppe cultures during the Eneolithic, including the interaction with the Mesopotamian world after the collapse of the Balkan cultures and the role of Proto-Indo-European as a regional language (ch. 12); the Yamna culture as the culmination of these developments at the Pontic-Caspian steppes (ch. 13); the migration of Yamna people into the Danube Valley and the origins of the western Indo-European languages at the Danube Valley (Celtic, Italic), the Dniestr (Germanic) and the Dnieper (Baltic, Slavic) (ch. 14); migrations eastward which gave rise to the Sintashta culture and Proto-Indo-Iranian (ch. 15); migrations of the Indo- Aryans southward through the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological complex into Anatolia and India (ch. 16); and concluding thoughts (ch. 17). Contents =Part One: Language and Archaeology= Chapter One: The Promise and Politics of the Mother Language Anthony introduces the similarities between a broad range of languages and their common ancestor, Proto-Indo- European. He proposes that \\"the Proto-Indo-European homeland was located in the steppes north of the Black and Caspian Seas in what is today southern Ukraine and Russia.\\" Anthony gives a short overview of the history of the linguistical study of PIE and then presents six major problems that hinder a \\"broadly acceptable union between archaeological and linguistic evidence.\\" Chapter Three: Language and Time 1. The Last Speakers of Proto-Indo- European Using a mathematical analysis borrowed from evolutionary biology, Don Ringe and Tandy Warnow propose the following evolutionary tree of Indo- European branches: * Pre-Anatolian (before 3500 BCE) * Pre-Tocharian * Pre- Italic and Pre-Celtic (before 2500 BCE) * [Pre-Germanic] * Pre-Armenian and Pre-Greek (after 2500 BCE) * [Pre-Germanic] Proto-Germanic c. 500 BCE * Pre- Balto-Slavic * Proto-Indo-Iranian (2000 BCE) Chapter Four: Language and Time 2: Wool, Wheels and Proto-Indo-European Anthony proposes that the Proto-Indo-European emerged after ca. 3500 BCE. He bases that especially on his analysis of Indo-European terms for wool textiles and wheeled vehicles: Chapter Six: The Archaeology of Language Anthony, following the methodology of Ringe and Warnow, proposes the following sequence: * Pre- Anatolian (4200 BCE) * Pre-Tocharian (3700 BCE) * Pre-Germanic (3300 BCE) * Pre-Italic and Pre-Celtic (3000 BCE) * Pre-Armenian (2800 BCE) * Pre-Balto- Slavic (2800 BCE) * Pre-Greek (2500 BCE) * Proto-Indo-Iranian (2200 BCE), split between Iranian and Old Indic 1800 BCE A key insight is that early expansions of the area in which Indo-European was spoken were often caused by \\"recruitment\\", rather than only by military invasions. With the Yamna culture as a nucleus candidate, the original recruitment would be to a way of life in which intensive use of horses allowed herd animals to be pastured in areas of the Ukrainian / South Russian steppe, outside of river valleys. =Part Two: The Opening of the Eurasian Steppes= Chapter Eight: First Farmers and Herders: The Pontic-Caspian Neolithic Ukraine rivers According to Anthony, the development of the Proto-Indo-European cultures started with the introduction of cattle at the Pontic-Caspian steppes, which, until ca. 5200–5000 BCE, were populated by hunter-gatherers. The first cattle herders arrived from the Danube Valley at ca. 5800–5700 BCE, descendants from the first European farmers. They formed the Criş culture (5800–5300 BCE), creating a cultural frontier at the Prut-Dniestr watershed. The adjacent Bug-Dniester culture (6300–5500 BCE) was a local forager culture from which cattle-breeding spread to the steppe peoples. The Dniepr Rapids area was the next part of the Pontic-Caspian steppes to shift to cattle-herding. It was the most densely- populated area of the Pontic-Caspian steppes at the time and had been inhabited by various hunter-gatherer populations since the end of the Ice Age. From ca. 5800–5200, it was inhabited by the first phase of the Dnieper-Donets culture, a hunter-gatherer culture contemporaneous with the Bug-Dniestr culture. Chapter Nine: Cows, Copper and Chiefs At ca. 5200–5000 BCE, the non-Indo-European Cucuteni-Tripolye culture (5200–3500 BCE) appears east of the Carpathian mountains, moving the cultural frontier to the Southern Bug valley, and the foragers at the Dniepr Rapids shifted to cattle herding, marking the shift to Dniepr-Donets II (5200/5000-4400-4200 BCE). The Dniepr- Donets culture kept cattle not only for ritual sacrifices but also for their daily diet. The Khvalynsk culture (4700–3800 BCE), located at the middle Volga, which was connected with the Danube Valley by trade networks, also had cattle and sheep, but they were \\"more important in ritual sacrifices than in the diet.\\" According to Anthony, \\"the set of cults that spread with the first domesticated animals was at the root of the Proto-Indo-European conception of the universe\\" in which cattle had an essential role. The Samara culture (early 5th millennium BCE), north of the Khvalynsk culture, interacted with the same. The steppe cultures were markedly different, economically and probably linguistically, from the Danube Valley and Balkan cultures at their west despite trade between them, the foragers of the northern forest zone, and from the cultures east of the Ural river. Chapter Ten: The Domestication of the Horse and the Origins of Riding: The Tale of the Teeth The domestication of the horse had a wide-ranging effect on the steppe cultures, and Anthony has done fieldwork on it. Bit wear is a sign of horse-riding, and the dating of horse teeth with signs of bit wear gives clues for the dating of the appearance of horse-riding. The presence of domesticated horses in the steppe cultures was an important clue for Marija Gimbutas's development of her Kurgan hypothesis. According to Anthony, horseback riding may have appeared as early as 4200 BCE, and horse artifacts show up in greater amounts after 3500 BCE. Horseback riding greatly increased the mobility of herders, allowing for greater herds, but also led to increased warfare by the need for additional grazing land. Chapter Eleven: The End of Old Europe and the Rise of the Steppe The Sredny Stog culture (4400–3300 BCE) appears at the same location as the Dniepr-Donets culture but shows influences from people who came from the Volga River region. The Sredni Stog culture was \\"the archaeological foundation for the Indo-European steppe pastoralists of Marija Gimbutas,\\" and the period \\"was the critical era when innovative Proto-Indo- European dialects began to spread across the steppes.\\" Around 4200–4100 BCE, a climate change occurred, causing colder winters. Between 4200 and 3900 BCE, many tell settlements in the lower Danube Valley were burned and abandoned, and the Cucuteni-Tripolye culture showed an increase in fortifications and moved eastwards, towards the Dniepr. Steppe herders, archaic Proto-Indo- European-speakers, spread into the lower Danube valley in about 4200–4000 BCE, causing or taking advantage of the collapse of Old Europe. According to Anthony, their languages \\"probably included archaic Proto-Indo-European dialects of the kind partly preserved later in Anatolian.\\" According to Anthony their descendants later moved into Anatolia at an unknown time, maybe as early as 3000 BCE. According to Anthony, the herders, forming the Suvorovo- Novodanilovka complex, probably were a chiefly elite from the Sredni Stog culture at the Dniepr Valley. Chapter Twelve: Seeds of Change on the Steppe Borders. Maikop Chiefs and Tripolye Towns The collapse of Old Europe led to a decrease in copper grave gifts in the North Pontic steppes. Between 3800 and 3300, substantial contact took place between the steppe cultures and Mesopotamia via the Maikop culture (3700–3000 BCE), in the northern Caucasus. To the west, Tripolye pottery begins to resemble Sredni Stog pottery, showing a process of assimilation between the Tripolye culture and the steppe cultures and a gradual breakdown of the cultural border between the two. Between 3800 and 3300 BCE, five eneolithic steppe cultures can be discerned, and Proto-Indo-European dialects may have then served as a regional language. * Mikhaylovka culture (3600—3000 BCE), on the Black Sea coast between the Dniestr and the Dniepr. Mikhailovka I people looked less like the Suvorovo-Novodanilovka people and may have intermarried more with Tripolye culture people or people from the Danube valley. Mikhailovka II upper level (3300–3000 BCE) imported pottery from the Repin culture (see below) and is regarded as early western Yamna. In the steppes northwest of the Black Sea l, the Mikhailovka culture was replaced by the Usatovo culture after 3300 BCE. The Mikhailovka culture at the Crimea developed into the Kemi Oba culture. * Post-Mariupol culture (early phase 3800–3300 BCE, late phase 3300–2800 BCE): around the Dnieper Rapids, near the Donets River. According to Ina Potekhina, the people looked most like the Suvorovo-Novodanilovka people. * Late/Phase II Sredny Stog culture (Dniepr-Donets-Don), c. 4000–3500 BCE. * Repin culture (Don) and late Khvalynsk culture (lower Volga): the Repin culture developedby contact with the late Maikop-Novosvobodyana culture (Lower Don), which penetrated deeply into the Lower Volga steppe. Anthony also believes that Repin was highly significant to the establishment of the Afanasevo culture in eastern Siberia, c. 3700–3300 BCE. Chapter Thirteen: Wagon Dwellers of the Steppes. The Speakers of Proto-Indo-European Location of early Yamna culture The Yamna horizon (3300–2500 BCE) originated in the Don-Volga area, where it was preceded by the Middle Volga's Khvalynsk culture (4700–3800 BCE) and the Don-based Repin culture (ca.3950–3300 BCE), and late pottery from these two cultures can barely be distinguished from early Yamna pottery. The Afanasevo culture, at the western Altai Mountains, at the far eastern end of the steppes, was an offshoot from the Repin culture. The Yamna horizon was an adaptation to a climate change between 3500 and 3000 BCE. The steppes became drier and cooler, herds needed to be moved frequently to feed them sufficiently, which was made possible by the use of wagons and horseback riding, leading to \\"a new, more mobile form of pastoralism.\\" It was accompanied by new social rules and institutions to regulate the local migrations in the steppes, creating a new social awareness of a distinct culture, and of \\"cultural Others\\", who did not participate in the new institutions. The early Yamnaya horizon spread quickly across the Pontic- Caspian steppes between ca. 3400 and 3200 BCE. According to Anthony, \\"the spread of the Yamnaya horizon was the material expression of the spread of late Proto-Indo-European across the Pontic-Caspian steppes.\\" Anthony further notes that \\"the Yamnaya horizon is the visible archaeological expression of a social adjustment to high mobility – the invention of the political infrastructure to manage larger herds from mobile homes based in the steppes.\\" The Yamna horizon is reflected in the disappearance of long-term settlements between the Don and the Ural and the brief periods of usage of kurgan cemeteries, which begin to appear deep into the steppes between the major river valleys. The eastern part (Volga-Ural-North Caucasian) of the Yamna horizon was more mobile than the western part (South Bug-lower Don), which was more farming-oriented. The eastern part more male-oriented, and the western part was more female-inclusive. The eastern part also had a higher number of males buried in kurgans, and its deities were male-oriented. Chapter Fourteen: The Western Indo-European Languages Course of the Danube, in red According to Anthony, Pre-Italic, Pre-Celtic and Pre-Germanic may have split off in the Danube Valley and the Dniestr-Dniepr from Proto-Indo-European. The Usatovo culture developed in southeastern Central Europe at around 3300–3200 BCE at the Dniestr. Although closely related to the Tripolye culture, it is contemporary with the Yamna culture and resembles it in significant ways. According to Anthony, it may have originated with \\"steppe clans related to the Yamnaya horizon who were able to impose a patron-client relationship on Tripolye farming villages.\\" According to Anthony, the Pre-Germanic dialects may have developed in the culture between the Dniestr (western Ukraine) and the Vistula (Poland) in c. 3100–2800 BCE, and spread with the Corded Ware culture. Approximate extent of the Corded Ware horizon with the adjacent 3rd- millennium cultures (Baden culture and Globular Amphora culture, Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture) Between 3100–2800/2600 BCE, when the Yamna horizon spread fast across the Pontic Steppe, a real folk migration of Proto-Indo- European-speakers from the Yamna-culture took place into the Danube Valley, moving along Usatovo territory toward specific destinations, reaching as far as Hungary, where as many as 3000 kurgans may have been raised. Bell Beaker sites at Budapest, dated c. 2800–2600 BCE, may have aided in spreading Yamna dialects into Austria and southern Germany in the west, where Proto-Celtic may have developed. Pre-Italic may have developed in Hungary,l and spread toward Italy via the Urnfield culture and Villanovan culture. According to Anthony, Slavic and Baltic developed in the Middle Dniepr (Ukraine) in c. 2800 BCE, spreading north from there. The Corded Ware culture in Middle Europe probably played an essential role in the origin and spread of the Indo-European languages in Europe during the Copper and Bronze Ages. According to Anthony, the Corded ware horizon may have introduced Germanic, Baltic and Slavic into Northern Europe. Chapter Fifteen: Chariot Warriors of the Northern Steppes The expansion eastwards of the Corded Ware culture, north of the steppe zone, led to the Sintashta culture, east of the Ural Mountains, which is considered to be the birthplace of the Indo-Iranians. Anthony skips over the post-Yamna cultures in the steppe zone (Late Yamnaya, Catacomb (2800–2200 BCE), and Poltavka (2700–2100 BCE)) but gives an extensive treatment of the intermediate Middle Dniepr culture (3200–2300 BCE) and of the Corded Ware cultures in the forest zone (Fatyanova (3200–2300 BCE), Abashevo (2500–1900 BCE), and Balanovo (3200–2300 BCE). After ca. 2500 BCE, the Eurasian steppes became drier, peaking in ca. 2000 BCE, with the steppes southeast of the Ural mountains becoming even drier than the Middle Volga steppe. In ca. 2100 BCE, Poltavka and Abashevo herders moved into the upper Tobol and Ural river valleys, close to marshes which were needed for the survival of their herds. They build fortified strongholds, forming the Sintashta culture at the southern range of the Ural mountains. Via the BMAC, they stood in contact with middle eastern cities like Ur, and the Sintashta settlements reveal an extensive copper producing industry, producing copper for the Middle Eastern market. The Sintashta culture was shaped by warfare, which occurred in tandem with a growing long-distance trade. Chariots were an important weapon in the Sintashta culture and spread from there to the Middle East. Anthony notes that \\"the details of the funeral sacrifices at Sintashta showed startling parallels with the sacrificial funeral rituals of the Rig Veda.\\" Chapter Sixteen: The Opening of the Eurasian Steppes Steppe cultures between 2200–1800 BCE are the Multi-cordoned ware culture (2200–1800 BCE)(Dniepr-Don-Volga), Filatovka culture, and Potapovka. In the forest zone are the Late Middle Dniepr and the Late Abashevo cultures. East of the Urals are the Sintashta and the Petrovka cultures. East of the Caspian Sea is the non-Indo-European Late Kelteminar culture. The Catacomb, Poltavka and Potapovka cultures were succeeded by the Srubna culture, and the Sintashta and Petrovka cultures were succeeded by the Andronovo culture. Reception Anthony's work received generally positive reviews. The New York Times, noting the longstanding debate among scholars over the origins of the Indo-European language group, stated, \\"Anthony is not the first scholar to make the case that Proto-Indo-European came from [the steppes of southern Ukraine and Russia], but given the immense array of evidence he presents, he may be the last one who has to.\\" Geographer Arthur Krim discussed the work in Geographical Review. According to Krim, Anthony's \\"debate is with the archaeologist Colin Renfrew\\" and his Anatolian hypothesis, which proposed that early Proto-Indo-European developed by around 6500 BCE, originating in the famous Neolithic site at Çatalhöyük in Turkey. According to Krim, The Rocky Mountain Modern Language Association's Rocky Mountain Review called the work \\"an archaeological feat\\" that \\"bridges the stubborn gap between linguists and archaeologists.\\" The review noted with approval Anthony's drawing upon Soviet and Eastern European studies that had previously been unknown to western researchers. The most critical review was Philip Kohl's \\"Perils of Carts before Horses: Linguistic Models and the Underdetermined Archaeological Record\\" in American Anthropologist. Kohl argues that Anthony's linguistic model is overly simple on the development of the Indo-European languages as products of divergence, originating from one single source. Though Kohl admits that Anthony pays attention to loanwords and the influence of neighboring cultures. Kohl is critical that Anthony's linguistic model guides \\"the archaeological interpretation rather than the reverse.\\" According to Kohl, \\"such a procedure almost necessarily means that the archaeological record is consistently manipulated to fit the linguistic model that it is meant to confirm; the reasoning is circular.\\" Kohl further notes that Anthony's reconstruction is bold and imaginative but is also \\"necessarily selective\\" and sometimes misleading when it relies on a rather limited number of items. According to Kohl, Kohl cautions about Anthony's proposal that horseback riding developed very early in the Chalcolithic in the Proto-Indo- European homeland. According to Kohl, horseback riding was almost invisible in the Ancient Near Eastern pictorial record until practically the end of the 3rd millennium BCE. Finally, Kohl notes that past fantasies about superior Aryans are dismissed by Anthony but that his descriptions of the influence of the Indo-European cultures on the Eurasian world may nevertheless feed into \\"fantasies about peculiarly gifted and creative Indo-Europeans–Aryans.\\" Nonetheless, Kohl also called the book a \\"magisterial synthesis of steppe archaeology\\" and stated that Kohl's critique was challenged by others, who noted that Anthony's extensive review of archaeological evidence suggested that he was using the linguistic model not to \\"'confirm' the 'archaeological record'\\" but \\"to interact with and help to explain [the archaeological record].\\" Awards * The Society for American Archaeology's 2010 Book Award.

History Orthodox Christian Theological education began in 1718 in Kazan with the setting up of a school for education of children of the clergy in the Kazan area. This was then followed by the opening of the Kazan Slavonic-Latin School in 1723. In 1732 this in turn, was reorganized as the Kazan Theological Seminary. In 1798 an attempt was made to provide higher education through the Kazan Theological Academy in 1798. However this proved unsustainable and in 1818 it reverted to the Kazan Theological Seminary. But in 1842, the Theological Academy was revived and continued to function until the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917. During this period it became the fourth theological academy in the Russian Empire. In 1847, the Kazan academy supported the missionary efforts of the Kazan Diocese among the non-Christian peoples by organising a committee to oversee translation of texts. While Grigory Postnikov was the bishop of the Kazan Diocese (1848 to 1856) that the Academy received an old library from the Solovetsky Monastery on the White Sea greatly enriching the library. While Anthony of Kiev was rector (1895 to 1900), the theological education at the academy reached its fullest flower.

It encompasses of mountainous terrain, with numerous lakes, dense deciduous and coniferous forests and alpine landscapes. The park was established to protect its ecosystems and biodiversity, as well as the cultural and historical heritage. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the park as Category II. Notably, the park has been recognised as an important bird area of international importance by designation under the BirdLife International Convention. It borders the Valbonë Valley National Park in Albania to the south. The Prokletije mountains are the southernmost geological continuation of the Dinaric Alps. The portion within the country's territory extends approximately from east to west, and from north to south. Rising to an elevation of , the Đeravica mountain peak is the second highest natural point of the mountain range, as well as in the country. The wide range of elevations and rugged topography of the mountains has created favorable conditions for a diverse vegetation and biodiversity. Large mammals such as wildcats, chamoises, roe deers, grey wolves, as well as rare or endangered species like lynxes and brown bears can be found within the forests of the park. A high number of species of birds, more than a dozen fish species, and a few reptile and amphibian species have been reported. Almost 37 species of mammals, 148 species of birds, 10 species of reptiles, 13 species of amphibia and 129 species of butterflies have been documented within the boundaries of the park. In terms of phytogeography, the park falls within the Balkan mixed forests terrestrial ecoregion of the Palearctic temperate broadleaf and mixed forest. The flora is diverse and is characterized with high endemism. A total of over 1,000 plant species have been identified parkwide. The vegetation is vertically divided into six distinct elevation zones. The oak forest zone, reaching approximately altitude of 800 metres, is dominated, among other by italian oak, austrian oak, and cornish oak. The beech forest zone can be found on the eastern part of the park at an altitude between 900 metres up to 1,320 metres. These include forests of silver fir, sycamore, south european flowering ash and bosnian pine. The mixed oak forest zone is mainly covered with silver fir, norway spruce and european hornbeam, between 1,200 and 1,540 metres. Within the dark coniferous forest zone, the most widespread floral communities of that type are dominated as well as by Bosnian pine, Macedonian pine and Norwegian spruce. The composition extends from an altitude between 1,540 metres up to 1,800 metres. The breeding of fir forests zone, lying at an altitude of 1850–1930 metres, is characterized by endemic species such as the Balkan pine. The shrub zone, at an altitude of 1850 to 2050 metres, is covered with grass, moss, lichen, and 55 species of herbaceous plants. The most common types include wood cranesbill, wild strawberry, willow gentian and wood forget-me-not.

The name Çelebi is an honorific title meaning gentleman (see pre-1934 Turkish naming conventions).  Background  Musa was one of the sons of Bayezid I, the fourth Ottoman sultan.Kastritsis, Dimitris (2007), The Sons of Bayezid: Empire Building and Representation in the Ottoman. Civil War of 1402-1413, Brill, There is no consensus about his mother's origin; she was either the daughter of the bey of the Turkish Germiyanids or a Byzantine princess. After the Battle of Ankara, in which Beyazıt I was defeated by Tamerlane, Musa and Bayezıd were taken prisoners of war by Tamerlane. However, after Bayezıd's death in 1403, he was released. He returned to the Ottoman Empire, which was now in turmoil, and tried to access the throne in Bursa, the Anatolian capital of the empire in 1403. However, three of his brothers were also claimants to the Ottoman throne: İsa Çelebi in Balıkesir and Mehmet Çelebi in Amasya (both in the Anatolian portion of the empire)), Süleyman Çelebi in Edirne, the European capital. (the Ottoman Empire at the time had two capitals, since the declining Byzantine Empire in Constantinople separated the two parts of the Ottoman lands).  Ottoman Interregnum  İsa defeated Musa and captured Bursa. Musa took refuge in Germiyanid territory, where he waited for a suitable moment to try again. In 1406, Mehmet, who had defeated İsa, became the sole ruler of the Anatolian portion of the empire, but he was no match for Süleyman of the European portion. Mehmet and Musa met in Kırşehir in central Anatolia and formed an alliance against Süleyman.Encyclopædia Britannica Evpo 70 ed., Vol. 22, p. 368 Most of the beyliks in Anatolia also supported this alliance. According to the terms of the alliance, Musa was transferred to the European part over the Black Sea where he allied himself with Mircea of Wallachia. Süleyman now had to fight on two fronts, against Mehmet in Anatolia and against Musa in Europe. This strategy was partially successful, as Süleyman gave up his hopes to conquer the Anatolian portion of the empire. However, he was able to defeat Musa at the battles of Kosmidion and Edirne. Despite his defeat, Musa continued with hit-and-run tactics against Süleyman up until 1410. Meanwhile, Süleyman had lost most of his previous allies due to his uncontrollable temper. In 1411, Musa's tactics finally gave victory and he captured Edirne. The defeated Süleyman, while attempting to escape into Byzantine territories, was killed by villagers on February 18, 1411, and Musa found himself as the co-sultan of the empire.Prof. Yaşar Yüce-Prof. Ali Sevim: Türkiye tarihi Cilt II, AKDTYKTTK Yayınları, İstanbul, 1991 p 74-75  As a co-sultan  The details of the previous Mehmet–Musa alliance are not clear. Musa declared himself the sultan of the European portion of the empire, while Mehmet viewed Musa as his vassal. Musa besieged Byzantine Constantinople (modern Istanbul) as retribution for Manuel II Palaiologos's support for Süleyman during the previous battles between Musa and Süleyman. Manuel II Palaiologos turned to Mehmet for support, who betrayed Musa and set up a new alliance between himself and the Byzantines against Musa. In 1411 and in 1412, Mehmet's forces clashed with Musa's, and in both cases Mehmet was defeated. In 1413, Mehmet gained the support of Serbian monarch Stefan Lazarević and the bey of the Turkish Dulkadirids, as well as some of the generals in Musa's army. He defeated Musa's forces in the Battle of Çamurlu near Samokov, Bulgaria. Injured and trying to escape, Musa was spotted and killed on July 5, 1413.Joseph von Hammer: Osmanlı Tarihi cilt I (condensation: Abdülkadir Karahan), Milliyet yayınları, İstanbul. p 58-60.  Aftermath  Musa's death ended the Ottoman Interregnum. His brother Mehmet Çelebi became Sultan Mehmet I. However, in 1416, Sheikh Bedreddin, one of Musa's former allies (chief military judge, the kazasker), led an unsuccessful revolt against Mehmet I.Encyclopedia of Islam, Vol. 7, Ed. C.E. Bosworth, E. Van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs AND CH. Pellat, (E.J. BRILL, 1993), 699. Other events that may be viewed as the continuation of the interregnum were the two rebellions of Düzmece Mustafa Çelebi, another one of Beyazıt's sons and one of Musa's, Mehmet's, and Süleyman's brothers who had been hiding in Anatolia. Mustafa was a fifth claimant to throne and he fought against both his brother Mehmet in 1416 and his nephew Murat II in 1421 unsuccessfully.

It uses the same systems as the standard Mastercard credit card but does not use a line of credit to the customer, instead relying on funds that the customer has in their bank account.  Algeria  Several banks offer Credit and Debit Mastercard in Algeria (Algeria Gulf Bank, Banque de Développement Local, Crédit Populaire Agricole).  Argentina  In 2011, Banco de Córdoba started offering Debit Mastercard to its clients, as a direct competitor to the Visa Débito card. However, this would not be a direct replacement of all Maestro cards in the Argentine market, since it will be analyzed with each bank.  Australia  As in the UK, in Australia the Debit Mastercard is a competitor to the Visa Debit cards provided by Visa Inc. The Debit Mastercard was first launched in Australia by Westpac in 2006 as an alternative card for the bank's Cirrus cardholders. The Commonwealth Bank, ME Bank and Westpac are notable for being the only banks in Australia to issue a Debit Mastercard to any account holder age 16 and older,westpac.com.au Retrieved 2012-09-12 whereas other institutions require cardholders to be age 18 or older. Notably, Bendigo Bank offer a debit MasterCard for students aged 12 years plus.  Baltic states  Swedbank has offered Debit Mastercard in Estonia since 2011, Latvia and Lithuania since 2012. Nordea has offered Debit Mastercard in Latvia since 2016. SEB has offered Debit Mastercard and Visa Debit for years equally in the Baltic states, but since March/April 2014 SEB decided to prefer Debit Mastercard as their main debit card, still somewhat offering also Visa Debit.  Canada  Debit Mastercard was launched in Canada in July 2016 with Bank of Montreal. Similar to most Canadian Visa Debit cards, BMO's Debit Mastercard is co- branded with Interac and operates solely over that network for point-of-sale transactions in Canada, but uses the Mastercard network for Internet and international transactions.  Germany  Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, Norisbank, Consors Finanz, MLP, netbank, KT Bank, O2 Banking, Fidor Bank and N26 offer Debit Mastercards to their customers. In Germany, the Debit Mastercard is a competitor to the national Girocard.  Greece  As of March 2015, all four major Greek banks offer a contactless Debit Mastercard to their clients. Eurobank Ergasias is replacing its Maestro line of debit cards with a new Debit Mastercard. The National Bank of Greece (NBG) started replacing its Maestro debit card with a new Debit Mastercard in March 2015. NBG is the last one of the four major Greek banks to offer a Debit Mastercard to its customers, and like Eurobank it only offers this debit card. The other two major Greek banks offer Debit Mastercard cards as well, but not exclusively. Piraeus Bank has added the option for a Mastercard Debit card alongside the Visa Debit (formerly Visa Electron) card that it had been offering in the past as the exclusive option. Also Alpha Bank offers Debit Mastercard and Debit Mastercard Contactless as one of three options for a debit card. It is not clear which debit card these two banks promote the most to customers that do not have a specific preference.  Netherlands  bunq bank issues a Debit Mastercard to its premium customers. Additionally, ICS issues MasterCard and VISA debit cards including 180-day insurance, which is normally not available on debit cards in the Netherlands.  Philippines  Major banks like BDO, Metrobank, Security Bank, and PNB issue Debit Mastercard. The country's largest bank, BDO is the first bank to roll out the first-ever Debit Mastercard with an EMV chip in the Philippines. This is for the enhancement of the security features and also for the safety and security of its cardholders. Debit Cards like Mastercard are also accepted in several Point of sales in the Philippines.  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, the Debit Mastercard operates alongside Mastercard's established Maestro debit card scheme, which previously were the only debit cards provided by Mastercard. However, almost all providers have switched to issuing Debit Mastercard instead, as the previous Maestro debit cards are not accepted as widely worldwide, unlike the Debit Mastercard which is accepted worldwide wherever Mastercard is accepted. Although, currently, the Maestro scheme still remains in place.

It takes place before the famous horse race known as the Palio on the 2nd of July and on August 16, each year.  Description  The parade has always occurred before the Palio since the race’s inception. It is a formally choreographed triumphal march that commemorates the ancient institutions, customs and greatness of the Republic of Siena. Special attention is given to the Contrade whose participants form the main part of the parade. The parade takes place in the Piazza del Campo with 14 groups and a total of almost seven hundred participants. In the early afternoon, on the day of the Palio, members of the town gather in the courtyard of the Palace of Justice and under the command of the field marshal, line-up in Piazza del Duomo next to the Cathedral. They parade between the crowd on both sides of the streets called: Via del Capitano, Piazza Postierla, Via San Pietro, Via del Casato di Sopra and Via del Casato di Sotto where they join the other members of the parade. The procession enters the Piazza del Campo on the first toll of the bell (the \\"Sunto\\") on the Torre del Mangia. Seventeen pairs of flag-bearers stop at the various points in the Piazza and in synchrony with the drum roll perform a spectacular flag-waving exhibition culminating with the throwing of the flag at the end. The parade marches to the \\"passo della Diana\\" (\\"passo\\" means step), the musicians of Palazzo play the march of the Palio of the maestro Formichi while the city trumpeters play on silver trumpets. The central focus of the procession is the passing of the Carroccio, the modern counterpart of the Republic's ancient triumphal chariot on which the silken colourful Palio banner is hoisted. After circling the square, the parade members take their places. The Palio is hoisted on to the judges stand while the seventeen flag- bearers perform their own drum roll, \\"la sbandierata della Vittoria\\" (the flag-waving of Victory), so called because it was introduced at the end of World War I. Composition of the Parade *The parade starts with 6 Mazzieri (Pole-bearers). *A Horse follows the standard-bearer on the \\"Balzana\\" icon accompanied by four of Siena's commanders. *Then the musicians of Palazzo advance, preceded by drums and silver trumpets that set the pace of the procession. *These are followed by the insignia of the city, \\"potesteria\\", that represent the lands and castles of the ancient Sienese state above the standard-bearers and their replacements from the municipality of Massa Marittima and the municipality of Montalcino, which guard this historical privilege. *The captain of the people rides with a page, preceded by a standard-bearer, 3 dagger bearing pages, with helmets and swords, followed by 3 gonfaloniers, the \\"Terzi\\" on horseback, and three centurions of \\"Masse dei Terzi\\", also on horseback, all accompanied by grooms. *In the next group is represents the Studio Senese (Senese means from Siena), it includes two drummers, a standard-bearer, a rector, four teachers and four students. *The standard-bearer and 3 of the Magistrates Merchandise preceded by two drummers followed by six representatives of each Contrada preceded by a standard-bearer who rears the banner of each of the guilds of each Contrada: **Tailors Valdimontone (Valley of the Ram)), **Pharmacists Pantera (Panther), **Sculptors Tartuca (Tortoise), **Weavers Selva (Forest), **Dye makers Oca (Goose), **Bankers Drago (Dragon), **Potters Nicchio (Seashell), **Goldsmiths Leocorno (Unicorn), **Notaries Aquila (Eagle), **Silk Makers Bruco (Caterpillar), **Cobblers Civetta (Little Owl), **Wool makers Torre (Tower), **Painters Giraffa (Giraffe), **Carpenters Onda (Wave), **Bakers Lupa (She- Wolf), **Tanners Chiocciola (Snail), **Smiths Istrice (Crested Porcupine). *A page bearing the \\"Masgalano\\" (prize for the best \\"pop\\") with two pages following. *Contrada parade of the ten in the race.

Founded in 1886, by 1900 it was the largest carriage manufacturer in the country. This very successful business made the partners rich men and it became the core on which William C. Durant and J. Dallas Dort began to build General Motors. Durant sold out of this business in 1914 and it stopped manufacturing carriages in 1917. Durant-Dort Carriage Company was dissolved in 1924. The premises were taken over by J Dallas Dort's Dort Motor Car Company which he closed in 1924.

Impressed with the smoothness of the ride Durant went to Coldwater and bought the road-cart's patent and manufacturing rights from Schmedlin and O'Brien for $1500. With Josiah Dallas Dort as an equal partner he founded Flint Road-Cart. Dort as president handled administrative details for the firm and manufacturing arrangements — to begin with the carts were made for them by William A. Paterson — while Durant handled sales and promotion. Their first office was in Durant's fire insurance agency in downtown Flint.Burton W. Folsom Jr. Empire Builders; how Michigan entrepreneurs helped make America great. 1998 Rhodes & Easton, Traverse City, Michigan 49684. He had bought the rights to the road- cart with borrowed money so newly married Durant immediately left Flint and set up a chain of jobbers to sell the carts as far away as Madison, Milwaukee and Chicago. With just one finished cart at home he returned from his first trip with orders for 600 road-carts. Flint Road-Cart sold 4000 carts its first year, and grew quickly from there. In 1893 they incorporated Flint Road-Cart Company with a substantial capital, much of it raised from local investors, and leased a factory on Water Street originally used by the Flint Woolen Mills. There they assembled their road-carts from bought-in components. After that Flint Road-Cart expanded by starting or buying other businesses that produced not only vehicles, but the components for vehicles as well. They marketed them as \\"Blue Ribbon Vehicles\\". Durant-Dort Carriage Company Flint Road-Cart Company changed its name to Durant-Dort Carriage Company in November 1895. By 1900 they were building 50,000 vehicles each year, from around 14 locations and they were a major rival of Flint Wagon Works. In 1906 they were making 480 vehicles each day with 1,000 workers. Durant-Dort owned not just the Flint manufacturing works, but also other vehicle assembly plants in Michigan, Georgia, and Ontario, together with timberland, lumber mills, a wheel manufacturer, the Flint Axle Works, and the Flint Varnish Works. =Diamond Buggy Company= A separate business named Diamond Buggy Company was established in 1896 to built low-priced carts sold for cash only. The first plant manager was A.B.C. Hardy. =Manufacture of own components= *1897: established Flint Gear and Top Company *1898: bought Imperial Wheel Company, Jackson. Imperial Wheel was later moved to Flint and Buick took over the Jackson plant *1900: established Flint Axle Works on a farm just north of Flint where the unavoidable noise would give less offence *1901: Flint Varnish Works Durant decided making their own components instead of buying them in would give Durant-Dort better control over costs and the ability to improve efficiency. All component factories were relocated to Flint to further speed production. These extra activities placed a lot of pressure on Durant's friends. Dallas Dort left the business in 1898 and didn't return until 1900. Hardy was sent on a tour of Europe in 1901. On that holiday he became fascinated by automobiles. In 1902 he established his Flint Automobile Company and built over fifty cars with Weston-Mott axles and W F Stewart bodies. The Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers demanded a licence fee of $50 for each engine Hardy had built so he ended production and \\"moved to Iowa\\". Dort Motor Car Company Durant-Dort continued making horse-drawn vehicles until 1917 but from 1915 the factory and office buildings refocused on the manufacture of Dort Motor Car Company automobiles. J. Dallas Dort began his own independent automotive business, Dort Motor Car Company, in 1915. Dort used the old Durant-Dort buildings but added more to them. Dort shipped 9000 cars in its first year. J Dallas Dort decided to retire and liquidated Dort Motor Car Company in 1924 and died the following year.Alan Naldrett, Lost Car Companies of Detroit, History Press, Charleston S C, 2016 Associates =A.B.C. Hardy's Flint Automobile Company= Alexander Brownell Cullen Hardy (1869–1948) began working at Durant-Dort in 1889. By 1895, he was supervising production of the Diamond, a low-cost buggy. In 1898, J. Dallas Dort took a two-year leave of absence from his position as president of Durant-Dort, and Hardy stepped into his place. After Dort's return in 1900, Hardy took his own leave of absence, and while touring Europe discovered the automobile. On his return, he supposedly told Durant to \\"get out of the carriage business before the automobile ruins you.\\" Although Durant didn't act at the time, Hardy struck out on his own and established the Flint Automobile Company, Flint's first automotive manufacturer, in 1901. However, the company's Roadster failed to distinguish itself from the popular, lower-priced Oldsmobile, and in 1903 the Flint Automobile Company folded. Hardy returned to Durant-Dort and wound up as vice-president of General Motors until his retirement in 1925. =Flint Wagon Works and Buick= Durant began to lose interest in Flint activities and set up an office in New York. A.B.C. Hardy tried to interest him in automobiles. Eventually James Whiting of Flint Wagon Works persuaded Durant to take what became a consuming interest in Flint Wagon Works' Buick automobile venture. Durant used his own capital and that of Durant-Dort to buy control of Buick. David Buick, already a minority partner in his own business, was left with a single share of his enterprise.

With thirteen seats in the Saeima, the National Alliance is the fourth-largest party in the national parliament and the third-largest party in the government. The party is a coalition of conservatives, Latvian ethnonationalists, and economic liberals. Formed as an electoral alliance for the 2010 election, the National Alliance brought together For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK and All for Latvia!. It won eight seats, placing it fourth among all parties. It merged into a single political party in July 2011 under the leadership of Gaidis Bērziņš and Raivis Dzintars. In the October 2014 election, it again increased its seats to seventeen, and entered a centre-right coalition, along with Unity and the Union of Greens and Farmers under Prime Minister Laimdota Straujuma. The Party has participated in every government of Latvia since the 2011 parliamentary election to prevent Harmony Centre, a centre-left, pro-Russian interests political party from entering the leading coalition. It is a member of the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe, and its two MEPs, Roberts Zīle and Dace Melbārde, sit in the European Conservatives and Reformists group in the European Parliament. The party controls the town and city governments of Ogre, Smiltene, Iecava, Aizpute, Priekule, Engure, Saulkrasti, Koceni and Rundale. In 66 municipalities the party is represented by 166 deputies. History It was founded as an electoral alliance in 2010 by the national- conservative For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK and the far-right All For Latvia! after the two parties were refused entry into the Unity alliance. The loose alliance was transformed into a unitary party on 23 July 2011. In the 2010 election to the Saeima, the alliance won 8 seats. As part of the outgoing government it was involved in negotiations after the election to renew the coalition, but was vetoed by the Society for Political Change, which had not been part of the government but had joined the Unity alliance. In May 2011, the party supported the re-election of Valdis Zatlers as President of Latvia in the 2011 election. The alliance became a single united party on 23 July 2011. At the 2011 parliamentary election, the National Alliance won fourteen seats – an increase of six on the previous year – making it the fourth-largest party. After extensive negotiations with an aim to avoid Kremlin supporting powers from gaining seats in government, it joined a centre-right government with Unity and Zatlers' Reform Party, with the party's Gaidis Bērziņš as Minister for Justice and Žaneta Jaunzeme-Grende as Minister for Culture. On 23 August 2013, All for Latvia! wing of National Alliance signed the Bauska Declaration together with Conservative People's Party of Estonia and Lithuanian Nationalist Union calling for a new national awakening of the Baltic states and warning about threats posed by cultural Marxism, \\"postmodernistic multiculturalism\\", \\"destructive liberalism\\" and Russian imperial ambitions. The merging period of the two founding parties was ended on the National Alliance's third congress on 7 December 2013, finally creating one unitary party. In October 2014 Saeima election, Party gained 17 seats in Parliament, and entered a centre-right coalition, along with Unity and the Union of Greens and Farmers under Prime Minister Laimdota Straujuma. The party succeeded to include several points in the Declaration of the government and coalition treaty: to begin gradual Latvianisation of the bilingual educational system starting from 2018; to limit the residence permit trading programme established in 2010, increase state support to family values and the demography programme; to make national identity, Latvian language and culture as a priority as it is defined in the Constitution of Latvia; opening of natural gas market in order to end the Gazprom monopoly in the Latvian energy market; veto rights to any decision which could weaken the positions of the Latvian language. Since the beginning of the Russian military intervention in Ukraine in 2014, the Party takes a very pro-Ukrainian position regarding the conflict and has suggested a stricter anti-Kremlin position for the Latvian government and Council of Europe. The Party actively opposes immigration – both the residence permit selling programme and the refugee quota system intended by EU, emphasizing the already large number of Soviet-era settlers in Latvia. It has compared the modern advocates of immigration with collaborators, who supported the planned mass immigration under the Soviet occupation. The Party was the only one of the leading coalition partners which completely refused both the refugee quota system, as well as voluntary acceptation of refugees. In August 2015, the Party took part in organizing the massive anti-immigration rally in Rīga. This anti-immigration position was accented in the annual foreign affair debates in Saeima, also turning against liberal immigration policy and political correctness in EU.

Like most of the Albanian Alps, the park is dominated by limestone and dolomite rocks and shows major karst features such as the Grunas Canyon and the southern wall of Arapi, which is considered the highest rock face in the Balkans. Despite of its limited area, the park is distinguished by a highly diverse flora with estimates which vary between 1500 and 1650 species of plants among which 70 species are endangered. Theth is part of a large preserved ecosystem all of which is primarily untouched with pristine quality. Biogeographically, the Dinaric Mountains mixed forests terrestrial ecoregion of the Palearctic temperate broadleaf and mixed forest biome occur in the park. There are three types of forest found at the park. The oak floor extends from an altitude between 600 metres up to 800 metres and is dominated, among other by austrian oak, oriental hornbeam, hophornbeam, cornel and flowering ash. The beech floor is mainly covered with common beech, silver fir and sycamore, between 900 metres and 1,900 metres. The alpine floor, lying at an altitude which ranges between 1,900 metres to 2,300 metres, is characterized by herbaceous plants and shrubs most notable amongst them is the juniper and willow. Moreover, the most important plants of this floor include the alpine bluegrass, alpine aster, trefoil and common bird's-foot trefoil. Only 20 species of mammals has been recorded within the park's land area. Additionally, large mammals such as brown bear, roe deer, chamois as well as rare or endangered species like the gray wolf, lynx, and wild goat inhabit the park. 50 species of birds have been observed, with raptors such as the golden eagle, lesser kestrel, nuthatch, robin, blackbird, red-backed shrike, western capercaillie and rock partridge. Due to the harsh winters, the park has few reptile and amphibian species.

It extended previous legislation by also making it illegal for UK nationals to perform female genital mutilation outside the borders of the UK. There have been no known cases of girls from Scotland being sent abroad for the procedure. The Act also increased the maximum penalty from five to 14 years. It replaced the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985. The corresponding legislation for the rest of the United Kingdom is the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003. Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) has been illegal in the United Kingdom since 1985 when the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985 was passed in Scotland. The rest of the United Kingdom quickly followed suit with each country creating its own version of the law. Over the decades that this law was in place, no conviction could be mounted as the law itself was too vague to be enforced properly. In order to protect the women of the British Isles the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985 was replied and replaced in 2003 when the United Kingdom passed the stricter Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 and Scotland’s corresponding Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Act 2005. The Scottish Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Act 2005 strengthens the original Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985 by defining Female genital mutilation in multiple forms. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is defined in section 1 of the act is \\"to excise, infibulate or otherwise mutilate the whole or any part of the labia majora, labia minora, prepuce of the clitoris, clitoris or vagina of another person\\". While this was useful to draw convictions originally, the wording in advertently also prohibited doctors and other people in the medical professions from giving several types of operations that may be necessary during and after child birth. The law was soon revised to say that no crime may be committed by an approved individual if the operation or procedure on another person is necessary for their physical or mental health; or if the surgical operation in question takes place during any stage of labor, or child birth, or if the operation takes place immediately after child birth for a purpose connected with said child birth or labor. The Scottish Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Act 2005 continues to surpass the original Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985 in preventing mutilation on a further level by adding the \\"Aiding and abetting female genital mutilation\\" clause to the act. The Aiding and abetting clause as well as related article define aiding and abetting as \\"To plan, help, assist, brainwash, intimidate, persuade, encourage or to be involved in any way in circumcising any girl or woman. This includes fathers and grandfathers who demand that their daughter or granddaughter is circumcised, even if they do not arrange the ritual to be involved in any way in getting any woman or girl to circumcise herself.\\" The clause was crucial in the process of mounting convictions for female genital mutilation as the original Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985 only prohibited the actual act of the mutilation by whoever commits the procedure, but not the people who would arrange the procedure or those who convinced the woman in question to have her genitals mutilated. Mutilation (Scotland) Act was further strengthened the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985, by outlining the punishments for committing Female genital mutilation of aiding and abetting female genital mutilation. Anyone convicted of Female genital mutilation or related offenses will be jailed for up to 14 years as well as a non-disclosed fine, and have their children sent to live with relatives. If the convicted does not have a visa or necessary documentation to remain in Britain, the convict in question as well as their immediate family will be deported to their country of origin and punished to the full extent of the law, as well as the possibility of being banned from working with children or returning to Britain. If the woman who has been mutilated is under the age of 17, she may be removed from the custody of her parents and be given medical treatment, while her parents or Care takers will be given strict conditions that they must comply with for the girl in question's health and protection. Furthermore any United Kingdom national or United Kingdom resident found attempting to leave the United Kingdom for the purpose of female genital mutilation will be treated as thought the offence was committed in Scotland, regardless of the actual location or destination. There was controversy over the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act (Scotland) 2005, as some claim the law discriminated against African immigrants; to which the Scottish government responded \\"This new law applies to everyone in Scotland, no matter where they are from. Many communities which circumcise girls are African, but female circumcision also happens in other countries, including in some parts of the Middle East, India, Sri Lanka and Australia.\\" References External links * Category:Acts of the Scottish Parliament 2005 Category:Female genital mutilation in the United Kingdom Category:Scottish criminal law Category:Women's rights in Scotland Category:2005 in women's history ","title":"Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Act 2005"},{"id":"28179722","text":"The Bethlehem Housing Authority is a municipal authority which provides public housing in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

These exhibitions were in the form of a competition, established by a Royal Decree from Queen Isabella II in 1853. It was the largest official exhibition of Spanish art. It was initially divided into five categories: Painting, Sculpture, Engraving, Architecture, and Decorative Arts. Painting was always considered the most prestigious category, however, and Decorative Arts was only occasional. Although the decree specified that they were to be held biennially, this was not always strictly observed.  Origins and proposals  The process began when it was noted by many critics that Spain was underrepresented in most international exhibtions. There were also widespread feelings that Spanish art had become decadent since the old patronage system, supported by the Catholic church and the aristocracy, had disappeared; due in large part to the continuing Confiscation. Then, in 1851, the Parisian cultural journal, L'Illustration, ran an article on the International Exposition of Fine Arts in Brussels with the headline, \\"L'Espagne n'existe plus!\\" (Spain no longer exists).Jesús Gutiérrez Burón, Exposiciones nacionales de Bellas Artes, Historia 16, Cuadernos de arte español, 1992, At that time, the recognized model for art exhibitions was the Paris Salon, with its regulations, juries, formal critiques, public exposure, established hierarchies of prize categories and opportunities for acquisition. In a proposal sent to the Congress of Deputies by the painter, José Galofré y Coma, the need for establishing such an exhibition was strongly argued. His proposition was accepted and forwarded to , the Minister of Development. After the questions of organization and funding had been settled, it was presented to the Royal Family for final approval. The exhibition was maintained in largely the same form until the 1920s, although the frequency became erratic; sometimes every two years, sometimes every three. There were also longer intervals due to political and social disruptions; notably the Spanish Civil War. The original concepts and criteria slowly became obsolete, and the last exhibition was held in 1968.

It became one of the most significant Greek educational centres in the region of Thrace, attracting teachers from Greece and Western Europe and existed until 1906. The Zariphios was one of the first schools of the Greek diaspora that introduced primary and secondary education for girls. Background Until the early 20th century, the Greek community was one of the three most numerous ethnic communities in Plovdiv, behind Bulgarians and Turks. Greek education was thriving during the 19th century and reached a peak in the 1880s. At that time the city hosted eight Greek language schools: one boys' school, three mutual education schools, one central, one district girls' schools and two pedagogical academies. There were also two private parish schools with clerics as teachers. History Zariphios was established in 1875 owing to an initiative of the Greek Education Committee of Thrace and the sponsorship of the banker and benefactor from Istanbul Georgios Zariphis, one of the prominent personalities in the Ottoman capital's business life at the time. Additionally, Zariphis offered an annual amount of 1,000 pounds for the school's needs. The school soon became a well known educational institution for Greek communities inside and outside the region of Eastern Rumelia (an autonomous province under Ottoman control, established in 1878 and united in 1885 with the Principality of Bulgaria) and Thrace. To increase its authority and prestige, the Zariphios increased its contacts with prominent educational institutions in Greece and Western Europe. Moreover, it attracted university teachers in the fields of philology, mathematics and theology from the capital of the Greek state, Athens, as well as music teachers from France and Germany. From 1881, the Zariphios and the rest of the Greek schools in the city synchronized their curriculum with the schools in Greece, while from 1885 they issued certificates identical to those of high schools in Greece. In 1906, Greek-Bulgarian antagonism over the Macedonian Question led to the departure of the majority of the Greek community. Their schools had to close, and the remaining female students of the Zariphios attended the local French college of Saint Augustine.

Hapljapyx are described as the most robust members of the family Japygidae.http://www.ento.csiro.au/education/hexapods/diplura.html Biology Fertilisation is similar to that of the Collembola where the male deposits a spermatophore on the ground. This is taken up by a female, who then lays her eggs in clumps in rotting vegetation or in crevices in the soil.http://www.ento.csiro.au/education/hexapods/diplura.html Some species are known to guard their eggs and young. Young diplurans resemble adults. Moulting continues throughout life and an adult may moult up to 30 times during its lifespan of about a 1 year.

Pakistan has deposits of several minerals including coal, copper, gold, chromite, mineral salt, bauxite and several other minerals. There are also a variety of precious and semi-precious minerals that are also mined. These include peridot, aquamarine, topaz, ruby, emerald, rare-earth minerals bastnaesite and xenotime, sphene, tourmaline, and many varieties and types of quartz .http://www.palagems.com/pakistanoverview.htm The Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation is the responsible authority for the support and development of the mining industry. The Gemstones Corporation of Pakistan looks after the interests of stake holders in gemstone mining and polishing as an official entity. Baluchistan has the most mineral deposits among the provinces of Pakistan, with Sindh rich in coal deposit and Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa rich in gems. Oil, gas and minerals used in nuclear energy purposes are mined by the federal government. The mining of other minerals is a provincial concern. Currently around 52 minerals are mined and processed in Pakistan.  Mineral salt  Rock salt makes for some beautiful texture on the walls and the ceiling Salt has been mined in the region since 320 BC. The Khewra Salt Mines are among the world's oldest and biggest salt mines. Salt is mined at Khewra in an underground area of about . Khewra salt mine has an estimated total of 220 million tonnes of rock salt deposits. The current production from the mine is 325,000 tons of salt per annum. Copper and gold In Reko Diq, Balochistan, deposits of copper and gold are present. Antofagasta, the company which possesses the Reqo Diq field, is targeting an initial production of 170,000 metric tons of copper and 300,000 ounces of gold a year. The project may produce more than 350,000 tons a year of copper and 900,000 ounces of gold. There are also copper deposits in Daht -e- Kuhn, Nokundi, Located in Chaghi district.  Iron ore Iron ore is found in various regions of Pakistan including Nokundi, Chinot and the largest one in Kalabagh (Less than 42% quality), Haripur and other Northern Areas. 11 February, 2015 The reserves were found in Chiniot, around 160 kilometres northwest of Lahore, by Chinese group the Metallurgical Cooperation of China. A senior provincial administrative official told AFP that initial estimates indicated 500 million tonnes of iron ore, a primary ingredient in steel making, had been discovered. The extracted iron had been tested in Swiss and Canadian laboratories, which were successful in finding 60-65 percent of it to be high grade.  Gems and other precious stones A number of precious stones are mined and polished for local as well as export purposes. The centre point of this operation is Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa and most recently Gilgit-Baltistan. These include actinolite, hessonite, rodingite, agate, idocrase, rutile, aquamarine, jadeite, ruby, amazonite, kunzite, serpentine, azurite, kyanite, spessartine (garnet), beryl, marganite, spinel, emerald, moonstone, topaz, epidote, pargasite, tourmaline, garnet (alamandine), peridot, turquoise, grossular, quartz (citrine & others) and vesuvianite. The export earned from these gems is more than 200 Million dollars.  Accidents in mining  Mining in Pakistan is a dangerous job, especially coal mining, as safety procedures are often neglected and accidents are quite common. There is air pollution with no modern safety equipment such as breathing equipment or ventilation. Nearly all miners have lung problems and many suffer from carbonmonooxide poisoning. But the main causes of death and injury are falls from cliffs, being buried when mines collapse and being hit by falling rocks. * On 27 January, 2019, two miners died after being hit by a trolley inside a coal mine in Balochistan's coal-rich Dukki district on Sunday morning. *On 21 March 2011 at least 45 miners died due to an explosion in a coal mine in Surran range, some east of the provincial capital, Quetta. * On 14 of February 2011, 2 Chinese engineers died in a chromite mine collapse in Qila Saifullah, Pakistan * On 27 May 2004, 15 miners died after a gas explosion at a coal mine in Balochistan.

Built in 1881 it was originally called the Ouvrage du Bois des Gasquets, it was the third and final fort built near Briançon as part of the Séré de Rivières system of fortifications in the 1870s and 1880s. Location Located at an altitude of , the Fort de l'Olive overlooked the valley of the Clarée above the village of Plampinet from a height of with a view of the Italian frontier. It specifically controlled the Col de l'Echelle, the Col des Thures and the Col des Acles. The rectangular walled fort extends over an area of about . History The Fort de l'Olive was armed in the 1880s with fourteen 120mm guns. It was initially linked to the Fort de l'Infernet by optical telegraph, and later by telephone. A cableway provided a means of resupply from the valley below, particularly in the winter when road access was difficult. The Batterie du Lenlon was a subsidiary position, as was the Batterie du Sapey. The fort was modernized in the 1930s with an infantry shelter or abri, known derisively as the Fort des Nuages (fort of the clouds), which was equipped with two casemates for guns. While being fired on by Chaberton in June 1940, the Fort de l'Olive in turn fired on the Italian fort Jaffereau in Bardonecchia. The construction of Fort Chaberton on an even higher peak on the Italian side of the frontier rendered the Fort de l'Olive vulnerable to artillery from Chaberton, which was higher. The position was used by the French Army in the defense of Briançon until 1940, when it was part of the Fortified Sector of the Dauphiné. The fort took artillery fire from Chaberton during the Italian invasion of France in 1940. The site is abandoned but in good condition, and is freely accessible.

Iranian Jews believe it houses the remains of the biblical Queen Esther and her cousin Mordechai, and is the most important pilgrimage site for Jews in Iran, and was declared a World Heritage Site by the Iranian government in 2008.'Outcry as Tomb of Mordechai and Esther in Iran reportedly set ablaze,' The Times of Israel 15 May 2020. There is no mention of it in either the Bavli or the Jerusalem Talmud and the Iranian Jewish tradition has not been supported by Jews beyond Iran. History A tomb of Esther and Mordechai is at Hamadan, within a mausoleum believed to have been built in the 1600s, and is first attested in the 11th century. Benjamin of Tudela visited the city, in which he reckoned there were 50,000 Jewish inhabitants, and described the tomb as in front of the synagogue. Benjamin of Tudela, The Itinerary of Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela, ed. and tr. A. Asher, New York, 1840, p 57. Shahin Shirazi, in his 14th century Ardashir- nāmah, was the first known Persian Jew to write of the dreams of Esther and Mordechai and of a journey they made to Hamadan, stating they died in the synagogue and within an hour of each other. The narrative of Shirazi may derive from earlier Judaeo-Persian sources, now vanished.W. Bacher, “Le Livre d’Ezra de Schahin Schirazi,” Revue des études juives 55, 1908a, pp. 280-313; Idem., Zwei jüdisch-persische Dichter Schahin und Imrani, Strasbourg, 1908b. According to the National Library of Israel, a French explorer at the outset of the 20th century discovered jewels in a niche located in the mausoleum's ceiling, and deposited them in the Louvre. A crown among the cache, it adds, are believed by the Hamadan Jewish community to have belonged to Esther. In 1850 J. J. Benjamin visited the place, writing that some 500 Jewish families lived there, with three synagogues. The tombs he described as situated in a magnificent building just inside the city walls, which the local Jews visited monthly, and where on Purim the Book of Esther was read and the tombs were stuck with the faithful's palms.Israel Joseph Benjamin II, Cinq Années de Voyage en Orient 1846-1851, Paris 1856, pp. 153-56. Ten years later, Yehiel Fischel Castelman also praised the tombs' magnificence, quoting the locals' tradition that it was built by one Cyrus, Esther's son; a date was inscribed on the dome, but he was unable to read it.Y. F. Castelman, Masaʿot šaliyaḥ ẓefat be-arẓot ha-mizraḥ, Jerusalem, 1942, pp. 71-72. Jakob Eduard Polak, in the same decade, described the shrine as the only place to which Persian Jews made pilgrimages and wrote of it as the centre of the Jewish quarter and their sole national holy place in Persia. He recorded inscriptions on the oaken coffins inside: the final sections of the Book of Esther, together with names of three donors who had contributed to refurbishment, and a date of 1309/10 CE. In a separate room, the date 1140 CE was inscribed.J. E. Pollak, “Die Juden in Persien und Mordechais und Esthers Grambal,” Jahrbuch für Israeliten, Wien, 1856, pp. 142-52. The Irani government maintains that the current structure dates back to the Ilkhanate, and a Hebrew inscription dating the construction of the structure to \\"1-4-5-7\\" (albeit written incorrectly) was recorded by a traveler in 1910.Ephemera Collection - The National Library of Israel In 1891, the tomb was described as consisting of an outer and inner chamber surmounted by a dome about high. The dome had been covered with blue tiles, but most of them had fallen away. A few tombs of worthy Jewish individuals were located within the outer chamber.Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan: Including a Summer in the Upper Kabun Region and a Visit to the Nestorian Rayahs, Mrs Bishop, 1891. pg. 133-134. Menahem ha-Levi, a rabbi of Hamadan, wrote in 1932 that the building was 20 m high, that there was an inscription of Isaiah 26 on the doorway, that the first room had been built two centuries previous above the graves of a physician and a messenger from Hebron, and that a 19th century Hamadan chief rabbi was buried in the centre of the room. Between the main tombs he described an opening into a cave beneath, which could be accessed for maintenance.M. ha-Levi, Mordechai ve- Ester be-šušan, Jerusalem, 1932. The archaeologist Ernst Herzfeld rejected the notion that the cenotaphs were connected with Esther and Mordechai, arguing that they were buried in Susa, and argued instead it was the tomb of Shushandukht, daughter of the late antique Exilarch Huna bar Nathan, wife of Yazdegerd I, and mother of Bahram V.E. E. Herzfeld, Archaeological History of Iran, London, 1935, pp. 104-7. According to Stuart C. Brown, the site is indeed more probably the sepulchre of Shushandukht, Jewish consort of the Sasanian king Yazdegerd (399–420). Local legend has it the pit between the two tombs opens into a way that leads directly to Jerusalem. However, the city of Hamadan in which the shrine is located, is the ancient Hagmatana/Ecbatana, the capital of the Median Empire which also served as one of the three, simultaneous capitals of the succeeding Achaemenid Empire. This is the dynasty to which the Bible assigns the story of Esther and Mordechai, the event that serves as the basis of the Jewish feast of Purim today. The tomb was the target of an arson attack in mid-May 2020. Destruction was minimal and limited to smoke damage, the blaze itself reportedly resulted in no significant injury to the structure. Although multiple Jewish organizations around the world condemned the incident and demanded a swift investigation, Iran's government did not respond to the report or the calls for arrests.Holy Jewish site of Esther and Mordechai set ablaze in Iran - reports Investigation by Hamadanian officials confirmed minor smoke damage and announced restoration work would commence the same week, but refrained from commenting on the cause of the fire. Images of the complex's entrance revealed a Star of David located in the entryway's transom had been partially destroyed and two small graffitos on either side of the doorpost — one a picture of Qasem Soleimani captioned \\"hard revenge\\" and the other a picture of Hezbollah general-secretary Hassan Nasrallah captioned \\"the promise, fulfilled\\" — although the damage to the Star of David dated to 2017.Anti-Semitism and Hatred Organized in the Islamic Republic + Photo (Persian) Alternative location Another tradition first recorded during the Middle Ages places the graves of Esther and Mordechai in the Galilean archaeological site of Kfar Bar'am, close to the kibbutz of the same name, Bar'am, along Israel's northern border with Lebanon.Michael Freund, Where is the Tomb of Mordechai and Esther? Home and Family: Who is Buried in Queen Esther's Tomb?, Dei'ah veDibur, February 28, 2001. It is, however, unlikely that a queen of the Persian Empire would have been buried in such a remote and unimportant place as a village in the Galilee instead of the summer capital of the Achaemenid Empire, namely the city of Hamadan where the current tomb is located. Artistically, the tombs of Esther and Mordechai are clearly much older than the shrine structure that dates only to the 12th-13th century. They are marked by a pair of large stones similar to the types that sealed off graves in ancient Israel and later Judea. Copious inscriptions in Hebrew identify the two tombs as those of Esther and Mordecai.

It was the first engagement between the two fleets in the River Plate region since the revolution, and a royalist victory.  Background  On 25 May 1810 the River Plate colonies revolted against the Spanish Viceroy at the May Revolution in Buenos Aires, claiming the necessity of assuming local government due to the difficult situation in Spain, which was occupied by Napoleonic troops. The royalist authorities in Montevideo opposed the measure and declared a naval blockade of Buenos Aires. In the city of Montevideo, there was a navy base serving as port for the royal Spanish fleet in the South American Atlantic coast. The local Junta Grande (Buenos Aires' revolutionary government) decided to establish a fleet to contest the Spanish dominion of the local waters.  Creation of the rebel fleet  The Junta Grande which took control of the government in Buenos Aires named Francisco de Gurruchaga, as secretary of the Navy. He immediately set to work to create a small naval fleet. With effort, Gurruchaga bought five vessels of different types from local owners, and equipped three of them with artillery, which had been taken for the most part out of service as obsolete. He obtained a schooner, a brigantine and a sloop, christened respectively \\"Invencible\\", \\"25 de Mayo\\" and \\"América\\". Recruiting of the crew was another difficult endeavor, as the inhabitants of the pampas were not used to a sailor's life. The solution was to hire foreigners, who for the most part did not speak Spanish. The rank and file was filled with locals. Command of the flotilla was given to a Maltese privateer, Lieutenant Colonel Juan Bautista Azopardo. This sailor had arrived in the River Plate at the beginning of the 19th century, and had participated in the British invasions of the Río de la Plata of 1806 and 1807. Azopardo commanded the \\"Invencible\\", seconded by Hipólito Bouchard on \\"25 de Mayo\\", and Ángel Hubac, on \\"América\\".  The first mission  At the beginning of 1811 the Junta Grande was immersed in armed conflicts in various fronts against counter-revolutionary (royalist) forces. A small army under the command of Manuel Belgrano had been sent to Paraguay to help the locals join the revolution, but after an initial victory at the Battle of Campichuelo, he was defeated at the Battle of Paraguarí and was forced to retreat. The Junta decided to respond to the reinforcement request from Belgrano, and tasked Azopardo with the transport by river of the reinforcement troops and artillery to Paraguay. The Maltese raised his flag in the \\"Invencible\\", while the Frenchman naturalized Argentine Hipólito Bouchard was put in charge of the brigantine \\"25 de Mayo\\". Lastly, the sloop \\"América\\" was put under the command of the Frenchman Abel Hubac. The royalist authorities in Montevideo learned of these plans and detached a flotilla to intercept the rebels. The mission was given to Jacinto Romarate, an able officer, who could deploy seven small warships of superior quality, and firepower than his enemy's.  The Battle of San Nicolás  Drawing of the battle of San Nicolás, after a sketch by Azopardo. Azopardo's flotilla left Buenos Aires, going upriver on the Paraná. Arriving near San Nicolás they saw the royalists and Azopardo decided to do battle. The rebel commander order a battery of cannons were removed from the ships and installed on the coast, and that a regiment of sailors and militias made ready to fight from the river coast. On 2 March they fought, when the royalist ships closed in the rebels. In the first encounter, two royalist brigantines (\\"Belén\\" and \\"Cisne\\") became groundned near the coast and were made targets for the coastal cannons and the rebel infantry. Nonetheless, Azopardo could not get to board them and the ships finally freed themselves and retreated. After several hours the royalists tried a new attack, and shot at the \\"Invencible\\". The \\"América\\" was hit several times, with a gash opening on her prow, beginning to take on water, and had to be abandoned by the crew. The royalists then concentrated on the \\"25 de Mayo\\", which they tried to board; the poorly trained crew became panicked and abandoned ship jumping overboard, against the attempts of Bouchard to stop them. The royalist vessels closed in on the \\"Invencible\\", which was by now fighting on her own, and boarded her. The crew fought valiantly for almost two hours until the situation became unsustainable. Azopardo tried to blow up the munitions depot, but the wounded begged him not to do it, so he was forced to surrender.  Consequences  The defeat caused the destruction of the rebel fleet and the taking control over the Rio de la Plata, Paraná and Uruguay rivers by the royalist fleet from Montevideo; which would last until 1813 with the creation of a new naval squadron and the victories of William Brown. In the short term, the reinforcements requested by general Belgrano did not arrive; few days after the battle at San Nicolás, Belgrano's army was attacked and defeated at the Battle of Tacuarí (9 March 1811). Juan Bautista Azopardo became a prisoner of the royalists and was taken to Ceuta, Spain. The revolutionary government in Buenos Aires, still started a judicial process in absentia to determine his involvement in the defeat. The report obtained recognized Azopardo's courage, but concluded he had demonstrated lack of experience in command and that he had allowed lack of discipline on his crew. The sentence given was the indefinite removal of command in the armed forces, establishing that he could only serve as a subordinate officer. Azopardo confronted while imprisoned in Spain charges of adhering to the revolutionary cause; and was condemned to death to later have his sentenced commuted. Finally in 1820, the liberal movement in Spain headed by general Rafael de Riego freed all political prisoners including Azopardo allowing him to return to South America. The following year, Buenos Aires rescinded his order and allowed him to return to military life in the Argentine Navy. The governing Junta communicated to the people the news of the defeat in a public proclamation on 4 March 1811:  Bibliography  * *  References   See also  * Argentine Navy * Juan Bautista Azopardo *Action of 14 May 1814 *Battle of Martín García (1814) Category:Conflicts in 1811 Category:Naval battles of the Argentine War of Independence San Nicolas Category:March 1811 events ","title":"Battle of San Nicolás"},{"id":"28180022","text":"Japyginus is a genus of diplurans in the family Japygidae.Sandra, Alberto, ed.

It was historically nicknamed \\"Skulltown\\" for its three large cemeteries: Loudon Park, Mount Olivet and New Cathedral. More than 50 percent of the homes in Irvington were built before 1950. Its population in 2008 was estimated at 4,548. The community's boundary with the Gwynns Falls neighborhood is drawn by Caton Avenue and the MARC Penn Line. Its boundary with Yale Heights follows Maiden Choice Run from Frederick Avenue (north) to Loudon Park Cemetery (south). Irvington's southwest corner encompasses Loudon Park Cemetery, ending at Beechfield Avenue (west), where it meets the Beechfield neighborhood and Wilkens Avenue (south). Founder of Irvington thumb On September 26, 1838, Cyrus \\"Irving\\" Ditty was born in West River, Anne Arundel County, Maryland. He was the youngest of two children of George Ditty of Virginia and Harriet nee Winterson. His sister was Sally. His parents lost three children in infancy, Roberta, Juliet & Georgianna. Irving's father was a descendant of Sir Jeremiah Jacob, one of Lord Baltimore's descendants. Irving preferred to be called by his middle name and used \\"C. Irving Ditty\\" legally throughout his life. Irving entered Dickinson College, Carlisle, PA in 1854 & graduated in 1857 (photo). In 1859, he was admitted to the Baltimore bar. In 1861, he joined Confederate Service, Company F of First Maryland Calvary where he met Augustus Schwartze. Irving quickly rose to Captain. In 1869, he married Sophia Leypold Schwartze, sister of Augustus. The couple had five children, Augusta, Sophia, Roberta, Henry & George Irving (twins). Augustus owned most of the land in Irvington. In 1874, Irving purchased a large amount of this land, between Frederick Avenue and Old Frederick Road, from his brother-in-law. Mr. Ditty had three dirt streets laid out, running north and south between the two turnpikes. He commissioned contractor A.S. Potter to build four houses on the avenue farthest west. He named this street Augusta, after his eldest daughter. The other two streets today are Collins and Loudon. The neighborhood, Irvington, first appeared on an 1877 map. The Ditty family resided at 4206 Euclid Avenue in Irvington. Irving maintained his law office in downtown Baltimore. He died on October 3, 1887 at age 49. He is buried in Loudon Park cemetery. After his death, Sophia moved away from Irvington to West Lanvale Street in Bolton Hill. She lived to be 86 & died in 1932. She is buried in Greenmount Cemetery in a plot with her parents. *Sources: ancestry.com, Oct. 1950 article The Baltimore Sun, Baltimore Census Reports, Google Books Public transportation MTA Route 10 passes through Irvington as it travels between Dundalk and Catonsville.

It was founded in 1876 by the Xavarian Brothers on the former Lusby estate. St. Joseph Monastery School originally consisted of only Whiteford Hall. This addition was added in 1955 due to increasing enrollment. St. Joseph Monastery School, founded in 1889 by the Passionists Priests of St. Joseph's Monastery, was established as a parish school on the property known as Cedar Lawn. The School Sisters of Notre Dame assumed responsibility for teaching at the school and on August 22, 1890, the first three Sisters arrived. Forty students were enrolled at its opening. As enrollment grew rapidly, a separate school building was constructed in Irvington at 3601 Old Frederick Road. On February 22, 1893, St. Joseph's Monastery School was dedicated by Cardinal Gibbons. In 1923, a new convent was completed to house the growing community of Sisters. Enrollment continued to increase and on October 3, 1954, ground was broken for a new 12-classroom addition to the school, offering enrollment from first through eighth grades. On September 18, 1955, the two-story brick addition to the school was blessed by Archbishop Keough. The school had steady enrollment until an increasing number of families began moving to the suburbs. St. Bernardine's Catholic School, previously St. Joseph's Monastery School, opened in 1997 at 3601 Old Frederick Road, offering enrollment to kindergarten through grade 8. It closed its doors on June 4, 2010. The school was one of 13 in the archdiocese selected for closing at the end of the 2009/2010 school year.St. Bernardine Catholic School to close. Letter from Rev.

After remodeling in 1967, it was renamed the Irvington Cinema and began screening classic and foreign films. The cinema's marquee became a somewhat less welcome presence, in a predominately Catholic neighborhood, when the cinema began screening adult films in 1969. It closed in May 1971 in response to local protests. In September 1971, the building was converted into a church. A marquee sign is no longer attached to the building.\\"Irvington Theatre\\".

The Passionist Order was invited to Baltimore in 1865 by Archbishop Martin John Spalding. In 1868, the Passionists built a small wooden church on a tract of land along Frederick Avenue, opposite Loudon Park Cemetery. This building became known as the \\"Church of the Passion\\", marking the beginning of St. Joseph's Monastery Parish.Parish History. St. Joseph's Monastery Parish website. Retrieved 2010-07-28. Construction of a new, larger church began in 1881 and was completed in 1883. Its cornerstone was placed by Cardinal James Gibbons. The original monastery, beside the church, burned down in 1883. A new monastery was completed in 1886. The monastery chapel is extant and contains an 1887 Niemann pipe organ. The congregation of St. Joseph's Monastery Parish outgrew their church building in the following century. In 1931, Archbishop Michael Joseph Curley placed the cornerstone for the parish's current church building. It was completed on October 2, 1932. In April 2014, Father Thomas McCann, administrator of St. Joseph's, announced that the Passionist Priests would \\"no longer shepherd\\" St. Joseph's Monastery Church after 149 years of residence. The order's departure date was scheduled for June 30, 2014. The Very Rev. Robert Joerger, the provincial of the Passionists, reflected on the advanced age of many members of his religious order, as well as the declining numbers of that order, in the decision to leave Baltimore for other places.

Olympiapark Schwimmstadion Berlin () is an aquatics venue located at Olympiapark Berlin in Berlin, Germany constructed for the 1936 Summer Olympics. Located north of the Olympic Stadium it hosted the diving, swimming, water polo, and the swimming part of the modern pentathlon events. A total of 140,231 attended during all competitions. It hosted the World Aquatics Championships in 1978 as well and was a venue of European Maccabi Games 2015. The stadium's ground level was constructed lower than the top part of the Olympic Stadium. Its swimming pool was 50 m long by 20 m wide, separated into eight lanes. Men's dressing rooms were located under the east stands while women's dressing rooms were located under the west stands. From the swimming pool's north end to the south end, the pool depth increases from 2 m to 2.30 m. The stadium is constructed of natural limestone. It is still in use (as of July 2016). The state certified technician Gregor Röß was responsible for the planning and conception, but also the manufacturing processes of the stainless steel pool.
