They began performing as Xerox Teens but with a growing fan base, an eponymous club night and airplay from Zane Lowe, Marc Riley, Jon Kennedy and Steve Lamacq the band came to the attention of the Xerox Corporation, and after some discussion they decided to change the name to XX Teens. They made four videos with the Sheffield filmmaker Simon Green, a creative relationship that has continued with Anthony Silvester writing the soundtrack to the 2012 short film Albatross: A Love Story. Videos for their songs were also created by the artist Juliette Blightman and the BBC New Music Shorts competition winner Kirk Hendry. The band's live shows included contemporary dancers, a uniformed brass section and special guests. Such performances, combined with their distinctive videos and comically recalcitrant radio and press interviews, were hallmarks of the band's early years and gained them a following in the art world. They collaborated with Cerith Wyn Evans to mark Modern Art Oxford's 40th anniversary, were photographed by Hedi Slimane and performed for Martin Creed at Tate Britain. Other notable performances included the Royal Festival Hall for Jarvis Cocker's Meltdown and a landmark show at Studio Voltaire where they performed with dancing dogs. The show featured Richard Curtis and his dog dancing display team dancing to a special set on the evening of a lunar eclipse. It was broadcast on Resonance 104.4 FM and raised a significant sum towards the upkeep of the radio station. In 2007, they signed to Mute Records and re-released the underground hit \\"Darlin'\\" as a limited edition 12\\" vinyl. The single had remixes by Andrew Weatherall and Ben Trucker and was listed as one of NME's Tracks of the Year. They recorded the album Welcome to Goon Island at Rockfield Studios in Wales. Silvester and the singer Rich Cash then re-recorded the LP at producer Ross Orton's studio in Sheffield. In the same year, the line-up changed with the bass guitarist Rich Nuvo and the drummer Seb Craig leaving; they were replaced by Jorgen Raa and Macks Faulkron. Following a succession of singles, including \\"How to Reduce the Chances of Being a Terror Victim\\", a satirical recital of Fox News' advice for U.S. citizens, and \\"The Way We Were\\", used in an advert for Harley Davidson, the album was released in June 2008 to mixed reviews. A spoken word coda from the political activist Brian Haw concludes the LP with an explanation of the motives behind his long-running peace campaign in Parliament Square. The band toured with The Kills, Frank Black and The Horrors, amongst others. They appeared on the front cover of Artrocker magazine in May 2007 and again in August 2008. Cerith Wyn Evans, Giles Round, Richard Birkett and Adam Latham designed four separate sleeves for the band's first single; the artwork and design for all subsequent releases was by Latham. Silvester and Cash continue to collaborate but have moved on to new projects, Silvester forming Technology and Teamwork with XX Teens drummer Sarah Jones and Cash forming The Skinjobs with Latham.

Although Clarke was a prolific composer, he is best remembered as an associate of Arthur Sullivan, for whom he arranged music and compiled overtures for some of the Savoy Operas, including Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado. Clarke began as an organist, pianist and theatre conductor, becoming a musical director for Gilbert and Sullivan, among others. While conducting at London theatres, he also composed a tremendous volume of church music, organ solos, songs, operettas and orchestral works. Beginning in the late 1870s, he composed incidental music as musical director for many of Henry Irving's spectacular productions at the Lyceum Theatre. He also composed music for many of the German Reed Entertainments and conducted at many other London theatres in the 1870s and 1880s. Clark published a Manual of Orchestration and music criticism, as well as some fiction. In 1889, he took charge of the Victorian National Orchestra in Australia, returning to England in 1892 and soon becoming conductor of the Carl Rosa Opera Company for several years. Biography Clarke was born in Birmingham, the son of an amateur organist.\\"Death of Mr. Hamilton Clarke\\", The Musical Herald, 1 August 1912, p. 237 He began playing the piano at age four, and by six had improvised a tune that he reused in one of his mature works forty years later. He took up the violin when he was eight and played in an orchestra at twelve. In the same year, he became the organist at his church and was composing music by age 19.Moratti, Mel. Clarke's profile from Argus, 20 May 1889, reprinted at the Gilbert and Sullivan Australia site His parents did not approve of his taking music up as a profession, and he was sent to work first with an analytical chemist and then with a land surveyor. According to The Musical Times, he did not take up music as a profession until he was in his twenties.The Musical Times, 1 August 1912, p. 521 In 1864 he was awarded the first prize for anthems by the College of Organists. =Early career= Clarke held posts as organist in IrelandMackerness, E. D. \\"Clarke, Hamilton\\", Grove Music Online, accessed 10 January 2009 and was conductor of the Belfast Anacreontic Society.

He left that post soon, however, to become a theatrical conductor. Richard D'Oyly Carte engaged Clarke as conductor in 1874 Clarke was Richard D'Oyly Carte's musical director and conductor at the Opera Comique in 1874 for The Broken Branch adapted from La Branche Cass√©e.\\"Amusements\\", Le Follet: Journal du Grand Monde, Fashion, Polite Literature, Beaux Arts &c.; &c.;, 1 September 1874 Clarke interpolated into the operetta a ballet of his own composition, \\"Les Pr√®tresses de l'Amour\\".\\"Music and Drama\\", Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle, 26 September 1874 In October 1875, Sullivan hired Clarke as a replacement musical director of Trial by Jury at the Royalty Theatre, London, when Charles Morton succeeded Carte as general manager of the opera's original production. Clarke then moved with the production to the Opera Comique in January 1876, where it ran until May. In 1876 Clarke was reported to be suffering from \\"a long and painful illness\\", and Carte organised a benefit concert for him at the Langham Hall.The Observer, 9 July 1876, p. 6 By December of that year, Clarke was working again, adapting the score and providing new choruses and ballet music for the first English performances of Die Fledermaus at the Alhambra Theatre.The Observer, 10 December 1876 The reviewer of The Observer found Strauss's music \\"thin and commonplace\\" and thought Clarke's additional music much superior: \\"in remarkable contrast to that with which it is associated, being full of bright, characteristic melody, well harmonised and enriched by masterly orchestration.\\"The Observer, 24 December 1876, p. 5 In 1877, Clarke participated in a very early experiment with telephony, with his organ playing being sent a distance of four miles down a wire.The Observer, 15 July 1877, p. 3 Clarke performed on the piano as an accompanist at the promenade concerts at Covent Garden that year,The Times, 22 September 1873, p. 12 and in 1878, encouraged by Sullivan, who was then in charge of the concerts, he conducted a major orchestral work of his own, a symphony in F major. The Times reported this concert thus: =Theatre work= Clarke conducted at ten or more London theatres,Scowcroft, Philip L. \\"Some British Conductor-Composers, Part 6 (conclusion)\\", MusicWeb, February 1994 including the Lyceum Theatre, where he composed music for a number of Henry Irving's productions, including Hamlet and The Merchant of Venice. Irving's co-star, Ellen Terry, wrote in her memoir, The Story of My Life, \\"No one was cleverer than Hamilton Clarke, Henry's first musical director, and a most gifted composer, at carrying out [Irving's] instructions. Hamilton Clarke often grew angry and flung out of the theatre, saying that it was quite impossible to do what Mr. Irving wanted. 'Patch it together, indeed!' he used to say to me indignantly.... 'Mr. Irving knows nothing about music, or he couldn't ask me to do such a thing.' But the next day he would return with the score altered on the lines suggested by Henry, and would confess that the music was improved. 'Upon my soul, it's better! The 'Guv'nor' was perfectly right.'\\"Marshall, Christabel. reprinted in Ellen Terry's Memoirs, pp. 121‚Äì22 He was one of the many composers recruited to write German Reed Entertainments at St. George's Hall.Woodbridge Wilson, Fredric. \\"Thomas German Reed\\", Grove Music Online, accessed 10 January 2009 These included Castle Botherem: or An Irish Stew (1880), Cherry Tree Farm (1881), and Nobody's Fault (1882) to texts by Arthur Law,The Observer, 15 February 1880, p. 1The Times, 2 June 1881, p. 8The Times, 13 July 1882, p. 1 and Fairly Puzzled (text by Oliver Brand) in 1884The Times, 14 June 1884, p. 1 and A Pretty Bequest (text by T.

In 1878, at Sullivan's instance, he was engaged by Carte as musical director of his touring Comedy-Opera Company from March to November 1878, while the Company presented a revival of Trial, the first provincial production of The Sorcerer, and, from September 1878, the first provincial production of H.M.S. Pinafore. He assisted Sullivan by arranging musical selections from H.M.S. Pinafore for the promenade concerts at Covent Garden in 1878 that stimulated audience interest in that opera. Sullivan described Clarke's arrangement as \\"most spirited\\" and conducted it at several of the promenade concerts in late August.Jacobs, p. 122Ainger, pp. 162‚Äì63 Clarke also made an arrangement from The Pirates of Penzance for the promenade concerts in 1880.The Times, 21 September 1880, p. 8 Clarke later arranged the overtures for Gilbert and Sullivan's operas The Sorcerer (for its 1884 revival), The Mikado (1885) and Ruddigore (1887). He also assisted in the piano arrangement of Sullivan's 1886 cantata, The Golden Legend and helped prepare the score for printing.Jacobs, p. 238 Sullivan biographer Gervase Hughes later strongly criticised Clarke's work, finding the Mikado overture carelessly constructed and his Ruddigore overture a \\"jumble\\" and \\"a crude selection, hardly redeemed by its spirited ending\\". Hughes also criticised Clarke's overture to The Sorcerer, though misattributing it to Alfred Cellier.Hughes, pp. 131‚Äì32 Sullivan considered rewriting the Mikado overtureShepherd, Marc. \\"The Sadler's Wells Mikado (1962),\\" A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography and was thought to have sketched out a new overture on more symphonic lines, but no trace of it survives.Hughes, pp. 136‚Äì38 Clarke's Ruddigore overture was dropped by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1919 in favour of a wholly rewritten overture by Geoffrey Toye.The Times, 25 October 1921, p. 8 In 1882 Clarke provided the music for Lord Tennyson's play The Promise of May, which was \\"a miserable fiasco\\", though Clarke's music was praised.The Observer, 12 November 1882, p. 6 He provided additional music, in 1883, for the English adaptation of Edmond Audran's Gillette de Narbonne.\\"The Royalty\\", The Era, 24 November 1883, p. 6; \\"Royalty Theatre\\", The Daily News, 21 November 1883, p. 6; and \\"A New Comic Opera\\", The Pall Mall Gazette, 21 November 1883, p. 4 He also contributed to the music of the successful 1885 burlesque Little Jack Sheppard. In 1887, he accepted the post of musical director at the Comedy Theatre under the management of Herbert Beerbohm Tree.The Times, 18 April 1887, p. 12 =Publications and compositions= 1898 production of Clarke's operetta for boys, Hornpipe Harry Clarke composed over 600 musical works, of which some 400 were published. His second symphony, in G minor, premiered in 1879,The Observer, 7 September 1876, p. 6 and he composed the music for some half dozen ballets and at least eleven operas. Compositions by Clarke mentioned over the years in The Musical Times showed the breadth of his interests, from part- songs, to organ works, to comedy: \\"Love and Gold\\": Four-Part Song;The Musical Times, Vol. 40, No. 671 (1 January 1899) \\"Original Compositions for the Organ\\": No. 110;The Musical Times, Vol. 30, No. 553 (1 March 1889), p. 170 Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis in B Flat;The Musical Times, Vol. 18, No. 414 (1 August 1877), p. 393 \\"Sonatina for the Pianoforte\\";The Musical Times, Vol. 18, No. 413 (1 July 1877), p. 347 \\"God so Loved the World\\";The Musical Times, Vol. 15, No. 353 (1 July 1872), p. 533 \\"To the Audience: Humorous Four-Part Song;The Musical Times, Vol. 34, No. 599 (1 January 1893), pp. 29‚Äì35 \\"They That Go down to the Sea in Ships\\";The Musical Times, Vol. 43, No. 709 (1 March 1902), p. 172 Romance for Violin and Pianoforte;The Musical Times, Vol. 38, No. 658 (1 December 1897), p. 824 and \\"To a Red Rose\\".The Musical Times, Vol. 42, No. 706 (1 December 1901), p. 818 In 1894, Clarke published The Daisy- Chain (Op. 352), an operetta for children in two acts, for which he wrote both words and music.British Library catalogue He also wrote both the libretto and the score for Hornpipe Harry, in 1897, a well-reviewed show depicting the adventures of sailors cast ashore on a remote island.Kidner, Walter J, \\"Hornpipe Harry at Bristol\\", School Music Review, September 1898, p. 70 One of his last compositions was the one-act operetta The Outpost, first produced by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Savoy Theatre in July 1900. It was produced as a curtain raiser to The Pirates of Penzance and Patience until December 1900 and also ran on tour in 1901‚Äì02. In 1888 Clarke published his Manual of Orchestration described by The Musical Times as an excellent little book. \\"As far as can be gathered, either from direct statements or implied directions, Gounod would be the model suggested for imitation, Wagner for avoidance.\\"The Musical Times, 1 August 1888, p. 486 Clarke's conservatism caused comment from other reviewers; The Musical Standard mocked him for denying that Wagner was a master of orchestration: \\"Mr. Clarke should re-edit his work, cutting out all this nonsense. It might then form an admirable book for the beginner\\".\\"The Study of the Orchestra\\", The Musical Standard, 2 January 1897, p. 15 Clarke also wrote several other books and articles about orchestration, as well as some fiction and song lyrics. =Later life= In 1889, Clarke went to Australia, where he succeeded Frederick Cowen as conductor of the Victorian National Orchestra in Melbourne. He was also made inspector of Australian army bands, and given the honorary rank of Captain.The Observer, 22 February 1891, p. 6 He did not enjoy Melbourne; after returning to England in 1892, he gave a talk describing his experiences, giving \\"many valuable hints ‚Ä¶ to those who might think of accepting appointments in the Australian Colonies\\".\\"Royal College of Organists\\", Musical News, 9 December 1893, p. 500 His comments drew a rejoinder from an Australian writer who accused him of \\"incompetence and lack of interest\\" while in Melbourne.G.

In later life, Clarke suffered from health problems that affected his mind. According to Ellen Terry, Clarke's \\"brilliant gifts... 'o'er-leaped' themselves, and he ended his days in a lunatic asylum.\\" Clarke died at Banstead Asylum in Surrey in 1912, aged 72.

History Late in 2005 enquiries were made as to the potential usage of Somerset County Council's logoSomerset Logo as a flag of the county either in its current form or in a modified form without the mace (the symbol of the Council's authority). The response was that the people of Somerset could fly the Council's flag to show their support for both their council and county. This reaffirmed the position that the logo is the property of Somerset County Council and not the county at large. Strong support for a flag subsequently came from David Heath, Lady Gass, as well as coverage from the Western Daily Press, Somerset County Gazette,Flag for Somerset and BBC SomersetDoes Somerset need its own flag? in addition to Orchard FM and Ivel FM. In 2006, resident Ed Woods set up a website proposing a flag for the county. This version entailed a red wyvern on a yellow background with no mace. However, as of December 2009, the website ceased and the campaign was taken over by the Association of British Counties as part of a wider effort to recognise more county flags. Early in 2013, the Somerset County Gazette reported that local law firm Pardoes had begun flying the county flag from their premises in Taunton. This prompted a response from long time Somerset campaigner Adam Thomas. In his letter, he pointed out the Somerset did not have a county flag, and that the one being flown was in fact the flag of Somerset County Council. As a direct result of this in May 2013, the Somerset County Gazette together with Pardoes, announced a county-wide competition for residents to design a new flag for Somerset, which was subsequently won by the design submitted by Ed Woods.Design a flag for Somerset Somerset County Council Armorial Banner Somerset Council Armorial Banner Commercially available variant flag Somerset County Council was awarded its coat of arms by the College of Heralds in 1911. The blazon or heraldic description of Somerset County Council's coat of arms is \\"Or, a Dragon Rampant Gules holding in the claws a Mace erect Azure\\". Meaning a red upright dragon on a gold background holding an upright blue mace. It has superficial similarities to the gold wyvern on a red background traditionally associated with Wessex (of which Somerset was part). With local government reorganisations, Somerset County Council no longer controls the whole of Somerset. This means that the coat of arms not only do not represent the whole county, but are not for public use. The logo that is based on the coat of arms is available for sale, but technically as it bears the mace it still represents the County Council. A commercial version of this armorial banner still currently exists, on a white background with 'Somerset' stenciled on the top of the flag.

He was Principal Physician of the Bethlem Royal Hospital and one-time consulting physician to George III. Physician Thomas Monro was born 1759, in London, youngest son of Dr John Monro (9th of Fyrish) and Elizabeth Culling Smith. He was educated at Harrow under Samuel Parr and attended Oriel College, Oxford where he graduated as a Doctor of Medicine in 1787. Admitted as a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1791, and acted as Censor on three separate occasions. He delivered the Harveian Oration in 1799. In 1811, he was named as an Elect of the College. Like his father and grandfather he was employed at Bedlam starting as Assistant Physician in 1787. He attended on George III in a joint consultation of specialists during the king's second illness in 1811‚Äì12, although Queen Charlotte ensured that his further involvement did not extend beyond that of a passive observer.Jonathan Andrews, ‚ÄòMonro, Thomas (1759‚Äì1833)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 In 1792 he became Principal Physician as successor to his father.

Patron Monro was also known as a patron to numerous artists (including Peter De Wint, Thomas Girtin, John Sell Cotman and William Turner). The group of artists around him was known as 'The Monro Circle' and included students from his ‚ÄòAcademy‚Äô in London, where evening classes were given.

It aired on CBS Radio from November 7, 1937 to January 6, 1954. In 1956, the series was adapted for television where it aired in syndication until 1957. Hersholt had portrayed the character Dr. John Luke, based on Dr. Allan Roy Dafoe, the obstetrician who delivered and cared for the Dionne Quintuplets, in the 20th Century Fox movie The Country Doctor (1936) and its two sequels. He wanted to perform the same role on radio but could not get the rights. He decided to create his own doctor character for radio, and since he was a Hans Christian Andersen enthusiast, he borrowed that name for his character of philosophical Dr. Paul Christian. Overview The program debuted as The Vaseline Program: Dr. Christian of River's Bend. Dr. Christian practiced in the Midwest town of River's End with the assistance of Nurse Judy Price (Rosemary DeCamp, Lurene Tuttle, Kathleen Fitz, Helen Claire). With the opening theme music of \\"Rainbow on the River,\\" Dr. Christian was introduced on CBS November 7, 1937, on The Vaseline Program, aka Dr. Christian's Office and later Dr. Christian, sponsored by Chesebrough Manufacturing Company's Vaseline. The small-town physician's good humor, innate common sense and scientific training helped drive off a series of villainous types who tried to interfere with the peaceful lifestyle of River's End, as well as dealing with personal problems among his many patients and the majority of those who lived in town. The program was also unique in that, by the mid-1940s, listeners contributed the majority of the scripts (some were \\"professionally polished\\" before they were used), and an annual script-writing competition introduced in 1942 was the highlight of every season- top prize: the $2,000 \\"Dr. Christian Award\\" {with several $500 \\"runner-up\\" prizes}; among the later winners were Rod Serling and Earl Hamner, Jr.. Produced by Dorothy McCann, the radio series became a popular success, continuing on CBS until January 6, 1954. KIRO Hersholt was so strongly identified with the role that he received mail asking for medical advice. There were various spin-offs; Hersholt co-wrote a Dr. Christian novel and made a series of six family films as Christian for RKO from 1939 to 1941. Films In release order: * Meet Dr. Christian (1939) * The Courageous Dr. Christian (1940) * Dr. Christian Meets the Women (1940) * Remedy for Riches (1940) * Melody for Three (1941) * They Meet Again (1941) Television In 1956, the Dr. Christian character made the transition to television in a 39-episode syndicated Ziv Television series, scripted by Gene Roddenberry, with Macdonald Carey as his nephew Dr. Mark Christian. Jean Hersholt appeared for the last time as Dr. Christian in the first episode, officially turning his medical practice over to his nephew.

Ace Centre offer assessment, training and information services in England and Wales, with a focus on Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) and Assistive Technology (AT). The ACE Centre have two offices, in Oldham and Abingdon.  History  The first ACE Centre was started in 1984 through UK government funding as part of the new initiative to introduce information technology into schools, in England and Wales following the end of the Micro-Electronics Project MEP. During MEP four Special Education Micro-technology Resource Centres (SEMERCs) were set up in London (Redbridge), Manchester, Bristol and Newcastle. A special education software development centre was also established in Manchester. It was felt that those pupils with severe language or physical disabilities required more specialist support. This idea for the first ACE centre to support these students came from Tim Southgate (Head of Ormerod Special School) and Prue Fuller, a teacher at the school. They were inspired by the computer research of Patrick Poon at the school. The original staff at the opening of the Centre in May 1984 were Prue Fuller (Director), Andrew Lysley (SEN Teacher), David Colven (Technical Officer) and Pauline Paine (Administrator). The Centre was managed by Mary Hope at MESU, a post that was later taken over by Tina Detheridge now of Wigit Software. It was essentially a project under the management of MESU (Micro Electronics Support Unit) a government quango which later merged with CET (Centre for Educational Technology) to become NCET (the National Centre for Educational Technology). This eventually became Becta (British Educational Communications and Technology Agency) in 1998.ACE Centre: History of the ACE Centre. (Source for part of the \\"Founcation\\" section.) In 1985 a second Centre was opened in Oldham at Park Dean School It was managed by the head teacher Rhys Williams, who later became principal of Hereward College, and Roger Bates (now of Inclusive Technology). The first Director proper of ACE Oldham as it was then was Steve Broadbent. The two Centres in Oldham and Oxford service the north and south of England and Wales respectively. Location The ACE Center was housed in a spare classroom at Ormerod special school in Headington, Oxford. Later it moved to temporary buildings on the same site and remained there until the new 'Wooden Spoon' building was erected on Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre site in 1998. The new 'Wooden Spoon' building was largely funded by the Wooden Spoon SocietyWooden Spoon: Project History . and was officially opened by Princess Anne in April 1999. The new building has custom built facilities for assessment and training. Staff It has occupational therapists, speech and language Therapists, special needs and mainstream teachers, assistive technology specialists and support staff. Early members of staff were Caroline Gray (occupational therapist), Gillian Hazell (the Nelms, Speech and Language Therapist) and Mark Saville (web page and publications creator). Prue Fuller retired as director in 1999 and was later awarded an MBE for her services to Assistive and Alternative Communication. She was also bi-annual president of ISAAC 1998 - 2000. Caroline Grey became director of the ACE Centre following Prue's retirement until she retired in 2007. Liz Tapper took over as temporary director until September 2008 and Dr Ben Janubi has been in post since January 2009.ACE Centre: Staff Profiles (incomplete source). The CAP Project This was a government initiative to boost the support and provision of communication aids to school students.Teach Training Resource Bank: Evaluation of the Communication Aids Project. The ACE Centres were two of the organisations involved with assessment for this project. It initially had a two-year timetable and a ¬£10M budget but was extended for a further two years on the same funding basis. During this time the staffing in the centre increased to cope with the assessment demand.  Software developments  The first software developments at the ace centre was to re-write Sentence Scan and Start-Write for the increasingly popular BBC Micro. Sentence scan was a switch or keyboard accessible sentence builder with speech support. Sentences could be built up from sets of stored words or phrases. Start-Write was a letter/keyboard based program with speech support and sophisticated user support configurations. Staff from the Centre also contributed to the design of the programs such as 'Prompt Writer' and 'Concept', being created by the Special Needs Software Centre based at the Manchester SEMERC managed by Dave King. The advent of the IBM compatible computer lead to more graphics based programs being developed for switch users such as 'Plocka' (Swedish for 'pick up'). Plocka has facilities for creating sorting and matching scenarios for switch users and has a built in graphics library. * AccessMaths is a program developed for students that need to create geometric drawings but cannot manipulate a mouse. Users can use a laptop keyboard only to produce accurate and detailed mathematical constructions and drawings. * SAW (Special Access to Windows) is a program that was created from a grant from the then Department of Trade and Industry to enable switch users to manipulate mathematical equations on screen. These programmable on-screen keyboards (selection sets) are now available for a number of very different applications. SAw 5 is now an open source program available from the Oatsoft web site. * Hotspots - This program has similar user characteristics to SAW, but is designed for point and click environments. In addition to scanning user defined spots on the screen it can annotate these with sounds, images and text.  Publications  The Ace Centre has published a number of reviews, guides, and 'how to' documents over the years. as well as contributing articles to conferences and peer reviewed journals. They have shared papers at conferences such as the ISAAC conference.  Research and projects  Ace Centre works with companies, universities and other charities to: * Investigate health and education issues for children and adults with complex disabilities * Support companies to trial new products and develop progressive technology * Find solutions for an individual or a sector Research and development projects enhance achievement and good practice in the field; directly, through the development of AT & AAC, and indirectly through awareness raising, skills building and informing government policy. Service- users with communication disabilities are involved throughout.

There she later found work as a domestic servant, though she was also interested in the war against Napoleon from an early age. During these wars Prochaska disguised herself as a man and registered for 1 J√§gerbataillon of the L√ºtzow Free Corps under the name August Renz in 1813, serving first as a drummer, then later in the infantry. She was severely wounded at the Battle of the G√∂hrde and field surgeons, rushing to treat her wounds, discovered she was a woman and took her to Dannenberg, where she succumbed to her wounds three weeks later. Legacy In retrospect, Prochaska was strongly idealized as a chaste heroine and honoured as \\"Potsdam's Joan of Arc\\" (\\"die Potsdamer Jeanne d'Arc\\"). Various plays and poems were written on her life (including those by Friedrich R√ºckert and Emil Taubert), whilst Ludwig van Beethoven began a \\"B√ºhnenmusik\\" (WoO 96) on her, with a libretto written by Friedrich Duncker. In 1863, a commemorative marker was erected over Prochaska's grave at St.-Annen-Friedhof in Danneburg and in 1889 her home town of Potsdam created a monument to her memory (\\"Der Heldenjungfrau zum Ged√§chtnis\\", or \\"In memory of the maiden-heroine\\"), which still survives in the almost completely cleared Alten Friedhof (old cemetery). =In music and literature= Ludwig van Beethoven composed incidental music for a play by Johann Friedrich Duncker about Prochaska, entitled Leonore Prohaska. Duncker was Cabinet Secretary for the King of Prussia whom he accompanied to the Congress of Vienna. Despite Duncker's hopes, Leonore Prohaska was not performed in Vienna, which may have been due to the fact that the material had already been treated in Piwald's Das M√§dchen von Potsdam which did have a performance in 1814. Context Prochaska was one of many German women to fight in the Napoleonic Wars, though almost all of them were ejected from the army when it was found out that they were women. The only known exception was Friederike Kr√ºger (1789‚Äì1848), who (thanks to the protection of her brigade commander) became the only known female corporal in the Prussian army. Finally she served in 2nd Garde-Regiment zu Fu√ü. Her request to retire was accepted in 1816 and she returned to civilian life. Johanna Stegen (1793‚Äì1842), from L√ºneburg, fought as a civilian for the rifle battalion of the 1st Pommerian Infantry Regiment in a battle at L√ºneburg where she provided the troops with ammunition. Anna L√ºhring (1796‚Äì1866) joined the L√ºtzower J√§ger in 1814 under the name Eduard Kruse and survived the Napoleonic Wars, though her public fame faded quickly.

Robert Vin√ßotte (Borgerhout, 1844-Schaarbeek, 1904) was a Belgian engineer who laid the basis for industrial workplace safety in his native country. He was involved in the founding of the two companies that would dominate the Belgian inspection and certification market during the twentieth century. He was also the brother of Thomas Vin√ßotte, a famous Belgian sculptor. Early years Vin√ßotte was born in Antwerp. His father was Jean-Henri Vin√ßotte (1807-1890), a man who started out as a communal teacher but eventually, through studies in Leuven and Li√®ge, became first a professor in Antwerp, then Ghent, and ended his career as a high school inspector (a function that was brand new and very prestigious at the time). Vin√ßotte Sr. was a highly respected man, once described as \\"la personnification du devoir et du devoir aust√®re. Ses inspections √©taient conduites de la fa√ßon la plus consciencieuse\\"Quoted in Jaumotte, page 11. Translation: ...\\"the personification of duty and austere duty. His inspections were performed in the most meticulous way\\". Robert Vin√ßotte also attended school in Li√®ge and in 1865, gaining the titles of \\"ing√©nieur honoraire des mines\\" (honorary mining engineer) and \\"docteur en sciences physiques et math√©matiques\\" (doctor in physical and mathematical sciences). In addition, he was allotted a post as a mathematics teacher at the AtheneumIn Belgium, the term \\"Atheneum\\" refers to a secondary school organised by the state, in opposition to those schools linked to Catholicism of Brussels, a great honour in those days. While teaching, Vin√ßotte deepened his explorations of the explosion of steam boilers. In 1872 Maurice Urban, a director of the National Railway Company of Belgium, asked him to take charge of a new organisation, which would be created for the purpose of inspecting steam boilers in factories. At the time, Vin√ßotte expressed the problem the new association (and the whole of the industrialized world) faced as follows: > Les explosions de chaudi√®res sont l'un des c√¥t√©s f√¢cheux de notre situation > industrielle. D√©sastreuses par les d√©g√¢ts et les ch√¥mages qu'elles > occasionnent, odieuses en ce qu'elles montrent la vie humaine pesant moins > dans la balance que les d√©penses pr√©ventives, elles sont, avec les autres > dangers du travail, l'une des causes le plus actives √† la d√©saffection des > ouvriers.Quoted in Lecocq, page 2. Translation: \\"Steam boiler explosions are > one of the regrettable aspects of our industrial environment. Disastrous > because of the damage and unemployment they cause, hateful because they show > human life as less expensive than preventive spending, they are, together > with the other dangers of work, one of the most biggest causes of > disaffected workers\\". Vin√ßotte went on to point out that, whereas in Great Britain there was on average one explosion for every 6000 boilers in service, for Belgium this rate was one in 1000 to 1200. He identified the main causes for this discrepancy as construction or design errors, coupled with bad maintenance, and concluded that regular inspections, as they were being performed in Britain, could decrease the number of boiler explosions in Belgium with at least 75 percent. Director of the association Front of a handwritten inspection report, addressed to Robert Vin√ßotte In August that year, 13 captains of industry and engineers gathered and set up the provisional organisation that they named the \\"Association pour la surveillance des chaudi√®res √† vapeur\\" (\\"Association for the Surveillance of Steam Boilers\\"). Its purpose was to prevent steam boilers from exploding through safety inspection and to promote a more efficient use of power. In return for a membership fee, it would provide semiannual safety inspections and staff instruction. According to the introductory letter, the association was non-profit. > Fond√©e dans un but philantropique, l'Association a exclu l'id√©e de faire des > b√©n√©fices; les ressources de l'Association seront enti√®rement consacr√©es √† > rendre le service aussi complet que possible.Quoted in Lecocq, page 4. > Translation: \\"Founded for a philanthropic purpose, the association has > excluded the notion of making profit; the resources of the association will > be entirely devoted to giving the most complete service possible. Middle of the same inspection report. Note the underlined big \\"Explosion de 1895\\" in the middle. The association had near to five hundred members by the end of 1872. By 1910, it would inspect more boilers than the combined inspection organisations of Germany and France.Lecocq, page 10 However, this success was still far away at the time: in 1873, the association only had three engineers at its disposal, one of whom was its director, Robert Vin√ßotte, himself. In that year, Vin√ßotte combined his function of director with inspecting 250 steam boilers (half of the number of steam boilers the association had registered at the end of the previous year). Vin√ßotte went abroad the next years, to D√ºsseldorf and the United States, to follow the latest innovations in steam engine and vessel technology. In 1875, he pressed the Belgian government to make inspections such as his company performed obligatory by law, something that resulted in the revised police regulations of 1884. Vin√ßotte's close cooperation with the state would continue in 1881 when he travelled to the United States again, this time on request of the Belgian government to bring back knowledge of the safety measures for steam boilers of the burgeoning American industry. The result was a compilation of rules for calculating the reliability and strength of the key parts of steam boilers, later published in a textbook. Also in 1881, the association announced that, after ten years, its amount of biannually inspected steam boilers had more than quadrupled, while only 0.17 percent of them had failed in the same period. For these and his earlier contributions to Belgian industrial safety, Vin√ßotte was awarded the rank of Knight in the Order of Leopold II in 1885. In 1887, a budget surplus allowed every one of its employees a life insurance, a fund that could also be accessed upon retirement. Death Robert Vin√ßotte died in 1904 after returning from a study trip to Italy, and would be replaced as a director of AV in 1909 by his son, whose first name was the same as his. He is buried in Schaarbeek. In that same year, AIB was given its second golden medal for its participation at the world exhibition in Paris. As a tribute, the \\"Association pour la surveillance des chaudi√®res √† vapeur\\" would be rebaptised in 1922 as \\"Association Vin√ßotte pour la surveillance des chaudi√®res √† vapeur\\", as it had already been known for some time abroad.

History Along with Sweden and Denmark, Finland was one of the first Western countries to recognize the People's Republic of China and form diplomatic relations with the country in 1950. The embassy in Beijing was opened in April 1952, and the first resident Finnish ambassador to China, Helge von Knorring, presented his letter of credence to Mao Zedong on 9 May 1952. Later that same year, an economic department headed by Olavi J. Mattila was opened at the embassy to foster the development of trade relations. As a consequence, Finland became the first capitalistic country to sign a bilateral trade agreement with the People's Republic of China in 1953. These steps, as well as Finland's staunch support for PRC's membership in the UN, formed a solid basis to the nations' relations well into the 1980s. Since the early 1990s, there has been at least one official minister-level state visit from Finland to China each year. Human rights =Hong Kong national security law= In June 2020, Finland openly opposed the Hong Kong national security law Trade Finland and China have had an agreement on economic, industrial, scientific and technological co-operation since 1973, and the agreement was last revised in 2005. The two principal trade organizations between the countries are Finland-China Trade Association and the China Council for Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT). One of the fastest growing areas of trade between the two countries are in environmental protection and information technology. =Information technology= Linux, the open source code first developed by Finnish software engineer Linus Torvalds, is playing a major role in the development of China's IT sector ‚Äì and in the country's rapid industrial development as a whole. Researcher, investor and open source code promoter Mikko Puhakka believes that Linux has established a good foundation for Finnish-Chinese cooperation. The roots of the Chinese open source code are in Finland. Professor Gong Min started using and developing Linux when he was doing his PhD research at the Helsinki University of Technology in the early 1990s. Returning to China in 1996, Professor Gong Min took Linux with him on 20 floppy disks. This is seen as the birth of Chinese open source code development and Professor Gong Min is now among the 20 most influential people in China. The first Linux server was started in May 1997 in Changzhou. Its domain name was cLinux.ml.org. Today a local distribution of Linux, the Red Flag Linux, is a compulsory subject in 1,000 Chinese universities by 2008. The Chinese view open source code as a critical factor in the country's development. Nokia is the largest Finnish investor in China. =Medical equipment during Coronavirus crisis= During the Coronavirus crisis, on 8 April 2020, Finland reported that 2 million surgical masks and 230,000 respirator masks it had purchased from China to fight the Coronavirus, had been found to be defective and unsafe for use. Sister cities =Shanghai-Espoo= The cities of Espoo and Shanghai are sister cities since 1998. Ever since, various collaboration programs have been carried out in areas of science and technology, urban development, culture, education, health care and environmental protection. The last high-level meeting was in June 2012 when the Mayor of Espoo, Mr Jukka M√§kel√§, met the Mayor of Shanghai, Mr Han Zheng, during a visit to China. In recent years, Finland-China relations have been strengthened by various Espoo-Shanghai actions.

On October 31, DeMarco unsuccessfully competed in a six-man elimination match to crown the first ever Iron Man Champion. =World of Wrestling (2008)= DeMarco made two appearances for World of Wrestling in 2008. On October 10, he wrestled against Mysterious Q for the Cruiserweight Championship in a two out of three falls match, which ended in a draw. His second and last appearance occurred on November 14, where he wrestled against Michael Faith in a losing effort for the Heavyweight Championship. =Total Championship Wrestling (2009‚Äìpresent)= In early 2009, DeMarco began working for the Austin-based Total Championship Wrestling. After appearing on the company's first ever show, he cut a program welcoming the fans in attendance to \\"The Lucha Lounge\\", a nod to his YouTube online show of the same. Later on in the night, he became the promotion's first Heavyweight Champion after defeating Dark Star.

After the war, she was in commission in the United States Coast Guard as the cutter USCGC Chincoteague (WAVP-375), later WHEC-375, from 1949 to 1972. She was transferred to South Vietnam in 1972 and was commissioned into service with the Republic of Vietnam Navy as the frigate RVNS L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát (HQ-16), seeing combat in the Battle of the Paracel Islands in 1974. When South Vietnam collapsed at the conclusion of the Vietnam War in 1975, she fled to the Philippines, where she was commissioned into the Philippine Navy, serving as the frigate RPS (later BRP) Andr√©s Bonifacio (PF-7) from 1976 to 1985. Construction and commissioning Chincoteague was launched on 15 April 1942 by Lake Washington Shipyard at Houghton, Washington, sponsored by Mrs. Doris Winden Rowe. She was commissioned on 12 April 1943 with Commander I. E. Hobbs in command. United States Navy service =World War II= New Guinea campaign Chincoteague departed San Diego, California, on 13 June 1943 for Saboe Bay in the Santa Cruz Islands, where she arrived on 6 July 1943 to support the New Guinea campaign as tender for Fleet Air Wing 1 (FAW-1). On 16 July 1943 the Japanese launched eight air attacks at Saboe Bay, killing nine of Chincoteagues crew and damaging the ship badly with one direct bomb hit and two near misses. Taken in tow first by the seaplane tender and then by the tug , Chincoteague reached Espiritu Santo on 21 July 1943 for emergency repairs, and later was towed to San Francisco, California, for a thorough overhaul. Central and Southwest Pacific operations After completion of repairs, Chincoteague put out from San Diego on 27 January 1944 for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and operations in support of the consolidation of the northern Solomon Islands, the occupation of the Marshall Islands, and air action in the Treasury Islands. She tended seaplanes at Kwajalein, at Eniwetok, in the Treasury Islands, and at Green Island. In addition, she carried freight, mail, and passengers among the Solomon Islands, Marshall Islands, Gilbert Islands, Mariana Islands, New Hebrides, and Phoenix Islands, and voyaged from Guadalcanal to Auckland, New Zealand, returning with aircraft engines. Escorting a convoy, Chincoteague sailed from Eniwetok on 24 September 1944 for Pearl Harbor and an overhaul. She returned to active operations on 6 December 1944 at Kossol Roads in the Palau Islands, where she conducted salvage and rescue operations for the next two months. Iwo Jima campaign and operations at Ulithi Atoll Chincoteague arrived at Guam on 13 February 1945 to join the assault force bound for Iwo Jima, and on 20 February 1945, arrived off the bitterly contested island to tend seaplanes until 8 March 1945. Similar operations at Ulithi Atoll followed until 8 June 1945, when she sailed for an overhaul on the United States West Coast, where she was when World War II ended with the cessation of hostilities with Japan on 15 August 1945. Honors and awards Chincoteague received six battle stars for World War II service. =Post-World War II= On postwar occupation duty, Chincoteague sailed to the East Asia to care for seaplanes at Okinawa and Tsingtao, China, between 18 October 1945 and 16 March 1946. She then sailed for San Diego; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Beaumont, Texas. =Decommissioning= On 21 December 1946, Chincoteague was decommissioned and placed in reserve. United States Coast Guard service Coast Guards adoption of the \\"racing stripe\\" markings on its ships. Barnegat-class ships were very reliable and seaworthy and had good habitability, and the Coast Guard viewed them as ideal for ocean station duty, in which they would perform weather reporting and search and rescue tasks, once they were modified by having a balloon shelter added aft and having oceanographic equipment, an oceanographic winch, and a hydrographic winch installed. After World War II, the U.S. Navy transferred 18 of the ships to the Coast Guard, in which they were known as the Casco-class cutters. The Navy loaned Chincoteague to the United States Coast Guard on 7 March 1949. The Coast Guard commissioned her as USCGC Chincoteague (WAVP-375) the same day. =Service history= Chincoteague was home-ported in Norfolk, Virginia, throughout her Coast Guard career. Her primary duty was to serve on ocean stations in the North Atlantic Ocean to gather meteorological data. While on duty in one of these stations, she was required to patrol a 210-square-mile (544-square-kilometer) area for three weeks at a time, leaving the area only when physically relieved by another Coast Guard cutter or in the case of a dire emergency. While on station, she acted as an aircraft check point at the point of no return, a relay point for messages from ships and aircraft, as a source of the latest weather information for passing aircraft, as a floating oceanographic laboratory, and as a search-and-rescue ship for downed aircraft and vessels in distress, and she engaged in law enforcement operations. In December 1955, Chincoteague took the disabled merchant ship Canadian Observer under tow to keep her from going aground off the south coast of Newfoundland in Canada. On 30 October 1956, Chincoteague rescued 33 crewmen from the West German merchant ship Helga Bolten in the North Atlantic by using two inflatable lifeboats during heavy seas. She then stood by distressed vessels for seven days until they could be towed to the Azores by commercial tug. On 1 May 1966, Chincoteague was reclassified as a high endurance cutter and redesignated WHEC-375. On 26 September 1966 her long-term loan from the Navy to the Coast Guard came to an end when the Navy transferred her outright to the Coast Guard. Chincoteague took the disabled merchant ship Kenyon Victory under tow south of San Salvador Island in the Bahamas on 5 October 1969 until relieved of the tow by a commercial tug. =Decommissioning and transfer to South Vietnam= In April 1972, Chincoteague and two of her sister ships, the Coast Guard cutters and , were deployed as Coast Guard Squadron Two, with crews composed mainly of members of the United States Coast Guard Reserve. They were originally scheduled to sail to Subic Bay in the Philippine Islands, but were diverted to the U.S. Navy base at Apra Harbor, Guam. Eventually the three cutters had their antisubmarine warfare equipment removed and were decommissioned, transferred to the U.S. Navy, and then transferred to South Vietnam. For Chincoteague, all three of these events occurred on 21 June 1972. Republic of Vietnam Navy service After Chincoteague was transferred to South Vietnam, she was commissioned in the Republic of Vietnam Navy as the frigate RVNS L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát.An alternative spelling encountered widely among this articles sources is Ly Thoung Kiet. (HQ-16)Per Janes's Fighting Ships 1973‚Äì1974, p. 592, \\"HQ\\" is an abbreviation for \\"Hai Quan,\\" Vietnamese for \\"Navy\\", used for all Republic of Vietnam Navy ships.This article assumes that the authoritative Janes Fighting Ships 1973‚Äì1974, p. 592, is correct about the ships lineage (i.e., that she was the former USS Chincoteague (AVP-24) and USCGC Chincoteague (WAVP-375/WHEC-375) and was designated HQ-16 in South Vietnamese service. However, extensive confusion exists on these points in print and on the Web. The Naval Historical Center Online Library of Selected Images entry for Chincoteague (see http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh- usn/usnsh-c/avp24.htm) and the United States Coast Guard Historians Office (see http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Chincoteague1949.asp) both agree that L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát was the former Chincoteague, but neither site mentions her South Vietnamese \\"HQ\\" designation. NavSource.org in its entry on Chincoteague (see http://www.navsource.org/archives/09/43/4324.htm) states in the ships history that Chincoteague instead became the South Vietnamese ship , but in photo captions posted below that in the Chincoteague entry states that Chincoteague became both L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát (HQ-16) and Tr·∫ßn B√¨nh Tr·ªçng (HQ-05). (Meanwhile, NavSource.orgs entry for and USCGC Castle Rock (WAVP-383/WHEC-383) (see http://www.navsource.org/archives/09/43/4335.htm) states that it was also Castle Rock that became Tr·∫ßn B√¨nh Tr·ªçng (HQ-05)). Conways All the Worlds Fighting Ships 1947‚Äì1982 Part II: The Warsaw Pact and Non-Aligned Nations, p. 369, agrees with Janes that L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát was the former Chincoteague, but also states that L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªáts designation in South Vietnamese service was HQ-05, a designation that Jane, p. 592, and NavSource.org (in both its Chincoteague and Castle Rock entries) state was the designation for Tr·∫ßn B√¨nh Tr·ªçng. To complete the confusion, the Inventory of VNNs Battle Ships Part 1 (see Part 1 at http://www.vnafmamn.com/VNNavy_inventory.html) claims that Chincoteague became Tr·∫ßn B√¨nh Tr·ªçng (HQ-05) and in its Part 2 (see Part 2 at http://www.vnafmamn.com/VNNavy_inventory2.html) contradicts all the other sources by stating that it was yet another ship, /USCGC Bering Strait (WAVP-382/WHEC-382), that became L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát (HQ-16). The Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships entry for Chincoteague (see http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c8/chincoteague.htm) apparently was written before the ship was transferred to South Vietnam and has not been updated, and therefore makes no mention at all of her South Vietnamese service. She was among seven Barnegat- and Casco-class ships transferred to South Vietnam in 1971 and 1972. Known in the Republic of Vietnam Navy as the s, they were the largest warships in the South Vietnamese inventory, and their 5-inch (127-millimeter) guns were South Vietnam's largest naval guns. =Service history= L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát and her sisters fought alongside U.S. Navy ships during the final years of the Vietnam War, patrolling the South Vietnamese coast and providing gunfire support to South Vietnamese forces ashore. The Battle of the Paracel Islands Possession of the Paracel Islands had long been disputed between South Vietnam and the People's Republic of China. With South Vietnamese forces stationed on the islands drawing down because they were needed on the Vietnamese mainland in the war with North Vietnam, China took advantage of the situation to send forces to seize the islands. On 16 January 1974, L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát spotted Chinese forces ashore on the islands. She and the Chinese ordered one another to withdraw, and neither side did. Reinforcements arrived for both sides over the next three days, including L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªáts sister ship , which appeared on the scene on 18 January 1974 with the commander of the Republic of Vietnam Navy, Captain H√† VƒÉn Ng·∫°c, aboard. By the morning of 19 January 1974, the Chinese had four corvettes and two submarine chasers at the Paracels, while the South Vietnamese had L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát, Tr·∫ßn B√¨nh Tr·ªçng, the frigate , and the corvette on the scene. Tr·∫ßn B√¨nh Tr·ªçng landed South Vietnamese troops on Duncan Island (or Quang Hoa in Vietnamese), and they were driven off by Chinese gunfire. The South Vietnamese ships opened fire on the Chinese ships at 10:24 hours, and the 40-minute Battle of the Paracel Islands ensued. Nh·∫≠t T·∫£o was sunk, and the other three South Vietnamese ships all suffered damage, L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát being one of the most heavily damaged ships; Chinese losses were more difficult to ascertain, but certainly most or all of the Chinese ships suffered damage and one or two may have sunk. Not equipped or trained for open-ocean combat and outgunned, the South Vietnamese ships were forced to withdraw. The Chinese seized the islands the next day, and they have remained under the control of the People's Republic of China ever since. Flight to the Philippines When South Vietnam collapsed at the end of the Vietnam War in late April 1975, L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát became a ship without a country. She fled to Subic Bay in the Philippines, packed with South Vietnamese refugees. On 22 and 23 May 1975, a U.S. Coast Guard team inspected L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát and five of her sister ships, which also had fled to the Philippines in April 1975. One of the inspectors noted: \\"These vessels brought in several hundred refugees and are generally rat-infested. They are in a filthy, deplorable condition. Below decks generally would compare with a garbage scow.\\"This quote, from the U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office at http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/McCulloch_1946.pdf, is unattributed. After L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát had been cleaned and repaired, the United States formally transferred her to the Philippines on 5 April 1976.

The Sperry SPS-53 surface search and navigation radar also was installed, replacing the AN/SPS-23 radar, although the ship retained both its AN/SPS-29D air search radar and its Mark 26 Mod 1 Fire Control Radar System. The Philippine Navy made plans to equip Andr√©s Bonifacio and her sister ships with new radar systems and long-range BGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship cruise missiles, but this upgrade did not materialize due to the worsening political and economic crisis in the Philippines in the mid-1980s.Harpoon Database Encyclopedia AVP-10 Barnegat class =Service history= After nine years of active service, Andr√©s Bonifacio reportedly was decommissioned in June 1985,NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive USS Chincoteague (AVP-24) although she was still listed as \\"active\\" as of July 1993.

He was portrayed by John Francis Daley. Daley first made three guest appearances as Sweets during the first eight episodes of Season 3, first appearing in \\"The Secret in the Soil\\". He was promoted to a series regular and appeared in the opening credits beginning with the episode \\"The Santa in the Slush\\". He also guest-starred on the spin-off The Finder. The character is killed off in the first episode of the show's tenth season, \\"The Conspiracy in the Corpse\\", making him the first main character of Bones to die. Little is revealed about Sweets' birth parents. In \\"Double Trouble In The Panhandle\\", Sweets reveals that his birth mother was a psychic working in a circus in South Florida; upon reaching the age of majority he attempted to track her down, but could gain no information from the insular circus community. Before being adopted he was in foster care. He lived in four foster homes by the time he was adopted at age six by the Finleys. He mentioned that he was beaten by a foster dad \\"for sport\\" and the whip scars are still visible on his back. His loving, but elderly, adoptive parents died shortly before Dr. Sweets began working with Booth and Brennan, leaving him without a family. Sweets' relationship with his adoptive parents, however, left him with the belief that broken people can be saved by people with good hearts, inspiring him to become a psychologist. Most of this was uncovered by Dr. Gordon Wyatt in reading Sweets' manuscript on Booth and Brennan's working relationship, stating that works like his often reveal more about the writer than the subject matter. He correctly deduces that Sweets was adopted as a child and suffered some sort of abuse. Details about his life as a teenager are few; but the episode \\"Mayhem on a Cross\\" reveals that he had been a fan of death metal as a teenager, which he still listens to after a bad day. Sweets is highly educated and intelligent despite his youth, holding two doctorates despite only being 22 years old when he made his first appearance in the show. He completed his undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto and has a master's degree in Abnormal Psychology from Temple University and two doctorates (Clinical Psychology and Behavioral Analysis) from Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania. To have reached this level of education, Sweets must have begun college at age 14 or 15, attending for three years before obtaining his master's degree in (roughly one or two years) and then his doctorates within three years. This has led some members of the team to doubt his degrees' validity, and Sweets has admitted to Brennan that he earned money for graduate school by teaching psychological techniques to car salesmen ‚Äî a fact that he is not proud of. Sweets began seeing Brennan and Booth in \\"The Secret in the Soil\\". Through Fox Online Special Features, it is implied Booth and Brennan continue to see Dr. Wyatt through \\"The Soccer Mom and the Mini-Van\\" before seeing Sweets solely. Initially, the pair do not regard Sweets seriously, Booth for his youth and Brennan for his profession. Over time, however, they recognize his skill in profiling and even develop a friendship with him, comforting him after his girlfriend April breaks up with him and later recognizing that Sweets wishes to continue studying them because he likes them. The relationship of Booth and Bones with Sweets continued to grow, and he developed a father/son relationship with Booth. He becomes closer to Booth and Brennan after a moment during \\"Mayhem on a Cross\\" when they share their traumatic pasts, eventually becoming a surrogate family and hiding their emotional bond with banter. Sweets has also started appearing more frequently in the field; notably, undercover as Angela's aspiring-fireman-husband-with-a- bad-back, to gain information on a suspect without a warrant. During his study of Booth and Brennan, Sweets began to write a book about them. In the episode \\"Mayhem on a Cross\\", Dr. Sweets received a review by Dr. Gordon Wyatt of his book on the relationship between Booth and Brennan. Dr. Wyatt explained that he felt Sweets had misinterpreted the relationship between Booth and Brennan by looking on a somewhat superficial level. The work primarily focused how Booth and Brennan are opposites and that their sexual attraction is limited because their primary responsibility is to their careers. Dr. Wyatt explains he feels Booth and Brennan are much more similar than Sweets understands and that one of the two is, in fact, aware of the underlying sexual tension between them and struggles with it daily. After learning about Booth and Brennan's backgrounds, he concludes that Sweets' \\"near obsession\\" with them and writing the book was a way of finding his place in the world and that he has created his emotional connection with them as a way of finding a family, something Brennan compares to \\"imprinting\\" like a baby duck. It is revealed in \\"The Dwarf in the Dirt\\" that Sweets has not published his book, because he fears how Booth and Brennan would respond to the book's conclusion that they are in love with each other. He asks Wyatt, now a chef, if he has the right to publish his book when Booth and Brennan cannot even admit to themselves that they are in love, but Wyatt tells him he left psychiatry so he would not have to deal with a dilemma like this. Work It is not known when Sweets officially joined the FBI or what his previous occupation, if any, was prior to joining the Bureau. He did mention that he was an intern at a mental health facility in Philadelphia, possibly coinciding with his time as a graduate student at Temple University or the University of Pennsylvania. Like his colleague FBI agent Seeley Booth, he is based at the J. Edgar Hoover Building and can be usually found in his consultation room. He occasionally accompanies Booth to interview victims' family members or analyze a crime scene for insight into a suspect. Sweets' young age and youthful appearance has posed a problem for him at work as other agents sometimes do not take him seriously. When they first met each other Booth conjectured that the worst thing that had ever happened to Sweets was that he \\"lost at Mortal Kombat\\". He is usually known to other agents, including Booth, as \\"the shrink\\". When he and Booth first worked together, Booth often treated him in a condescending manner and would refer to or address him as \\"The Shrink\\", amongst other humorous variations, instead of his actual name. Likewise, Agent Olivia Sparling, a rookie agent he was paired with when Booth was unavailable, viewed him with disdain upon their first meeting but was also won over by his skill. On occasion Booth will pull rank and trick Sweets into doing an interrogation or unwanted tasks (mostly paperwork, going over documents or speaking to annoying suspects) for him, much to Sweets' chagrin. After Sweets received his badge in season 7, Booth still introduced him as \\"Dr. Sweets\\" so that the latter would be taken seriously. Sweets appears to be formally trained as a psychoanalytic psychologist, often referencing Freudian theories and approaches, even describing the psychosexual stages of childhood development to Booth. Ironically, Dr. Wyatt notes that \\"Freud has been largely discredited\\" in \\"Mayhem on a Cross\\", but still shows a great amount of respect and support towards Sweets. Despite his age, Sweets' expertise is recognized and, often grudgingly, appreciated by Booth and the team. In more complicated cases or when dealing with difficult suspects he has been the only one able to offer any insight or get through to the suspect. He was also the first to correctly deduce murderer Christopher Pelant's real motives after the Jeffersonian team kept hitting dead ends with the physical evidence. During the time frame between Seasons 5 and 6 Sweets takes a sabbatical from the FBI while Dr. Brennan and Daisy went to the Maluku Islands, Booth was deployed to Afghanistan and Angela and Hodgins traveled to Paris. He was reluctant to return after calling off his engagement with Daisy but prosecutor Caroline Julian tricked him into returning by calling him up saying that Booth had returned with \\"posttraumatic stress syndrome\\" and needed psychological help (which was not true). In Season 9 he takes a brief sabbatical but returns in several episodes to assist with Booth's cases. After Booth kills Pelant, Sweets returns permanently, only to find that the department has acquired a new computerized profiling system called VAL and linked it to Dr. Camille Saroyan's office at the Jeffersonian. Throughout the episode \\"The Lady on the List\\", he makes his displeasure known to Booth and Cam, who comments to Sweets that he \\"may as well hate a transistor radio\\". Booth eventually shuts his VAL down when physical evidence disproved its analysis, stating that he still prefers Sweets to a computer. In Season 7, Sweets decided to earn his firearms qualifications, which likely meant that he was not a sworn special agent as FBI regulations require special agents to be armed.FBI - About Us - Frequently Asked Questions He stated that he wanted to back Booth up in light of the number of violent suspects Booth has to deal with on a regular basis and the fact that he also regularly accompanies Booth out into the field. At first Booth was skeptical and told Bones, \\"it's crazy for [Sweets] to own a gun\\". Unable to dissuade him, Booth \\"called in a favor\\" to take over as range master for Sweets' test stating that since Sweets wants to back him up, he needed to see for himself that he could trust Sweets with his back. Sweets was grazed by a bullet during the test but passed. In Season 9 he makes his first arrest, indicating that he has special agent status even though he is never addressed as a such. Relationships Sweets had a relationship with Daisy Wick, an intern at the Jeffersonian. He asked her to marry him and later they broke up. At the beginning of the program's tenth season, Sweets is revealed to have impregnated Wick sometime prior to the first episode. =Colleagues= As a psychologist, Sweets' initial relationships with the main cast are as that of an advisor and he often tries to help others, even when his aid is unwanted. Despite this, all of the main characters have gone to him for advice, usually more than once and have developed some sort of friendship with him, although some (particularly Hodgins and Booth) view him as annoying. Sweets confesses that he had a secret thing for Angela at one point, mentioning in Booth's coma about Daisy, but Hodgins misinterprets it as love for Angela and replies: \\"Angela? You don't have a chance with Angela\\" but, after being intimidated by her father in \\"The Science in the Physicist\\" he loses interest. Despite his aptitude for behavioral analysis, he believed for a time that all the members of the team hated him and found him annoying due to their behavior toward him. However, all of them have come to him for advice at least once, a fact reaffirmed by Cam. After Zack Addy was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for committing a murder, Sweets became his therapist and until his death, saw him on a regular basis. Initially, Sweets believes that Zack does not feel guilty enough about murder and that he should feel less guilty about being taken in by Gormogon's rhetoric. However, in \\"The Perfect Pieces in the Purple Pond\\", Zack reveals that he is innocent of murder and simply provided Gormogon with information. Although Sweets wishes to reveal this to Brennan and Booth, Zack invokes patient confidentiality, knowing that he would be prosecuted as an accessory to murder and believes that he would not fare well in prison. Seeley Booth Although Booth is initially disrespectful of Sweets due to his youth, the two eventually develop a friendship, albeit one that is, for a time, pressed by Sweets' interest in Booth's past as an abused child and Booth's dismissive treatment of Sweets. Booth does, however, recognize Sweets' skill as a profiler and often takes Sweets along to conduct interrogations and analyze a victim or suspect's personal effects for some insight. Throughout the fourth season, the two develop a father/son relationship, something that is especially obvious when Sweets turns to Booth for advice about his girlfriend in \\"The Cinderella in the Cardboard\\". This is again apparent when Sweets doubts Booth's trust in him when Booth consults Dr. Wyatt over himself when he discovers that, following his operation, he is no longer the expert marksman he once was. However, Wyatt points out that Booth taking Sweets into interrogations was evidence of Booth's implicit trust in him, while Booth merely avoided discussing his potentially work-related issue with Sweets because Sweets' first loyalty would be to the FBI and he did not want to create a conflict of interest for him because he was too fond of him. In \\"The Critic in the Cabernet\\" when Booth is in the hospital, Sweets is visibly upset and emotional about Booth's predicament. Booth also seems to have a grudging respect for Sweets's skill as a psychologist. Although Booth is unenthusiastic about their regular appointments, he occasionally seeks Sweets's advice and even asked him for help with Parker. On other occasions, Booth has asked for Sweets's help during investigations, even explicitly recommending him to Cam on one occasion. In the beginning of the fifth season, Sweets observes that Booth is in love with Brennan, but Sweets intervenes, believing that his attraction is a by-product of the alternate world he experienced during his coma. He warns Booth that the attraction may not be real and that he should not act on his feelings as he may later fall out of love and hurt Brennan. Although Booth initially disregards him, he later seems to realize the validity of his advice and ultimately decides not to tell Brennan that he is in love with her. Temperance Brennan Sweets has a good friendship with Brennan, despite her disdain for his profession. When Brennan sees Sweets' girlfriend, Daisy, trying on a bridal gown with another man, Brennan states that she likes Sweets and can't bring herself to lie to him because she thinks she can spare him some emotional pain.The Cinderella in the Cardboard Later, after learning that Sweets was abused as a child, she shares a part of her own pained childhood with him in an attempt to connect with him. Prior to this, Sweets has made his own attempts to develop a friendship with Brennan, even asking on one occasion to call her \\"Bones\\" after she protects him from an attacker, although his request is promptly denied as the moniker was reserved exclusively for Booth. Later on, during \\"The Night in the Bones Museum\\", Brennan agrees to rehire Daisy when Sweets says he would take it as a personal favor, possibly as a result of her affection for him. Brennan's dislike of psychology does, however, occasionally cause friction in their relationship. Like Booth, she eventually, and grudgingly, developed a respect for Sweets' profession. In \\"The Beaver in the Otter\\", Sweets notices three frat boys that were feigning their grief for their late frat brother. When Brennan learns he used psychology to deduce this, she says that he had simply 'guessed', upsetting Sweets. At the end of the episode, Sweets is able to uncover the killer, but when Brennan again asks him how, he simply says that Brennan won't believe him and that he 'guessed', revealing that her words had hurt him. On occasion, however, Brennan will admit to the uses of psychology, such as when she asked Sweets to help her learn to read people the same way Booth does. Additionally, in the episode \\"The Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\\", Sweets attempts to understand why three people killed their neighbor. He explains that, although it is not necessary to the case, he wants that insight into the human mind, something that Brennan accepts and respects. There is, however, one aspect of Sweets' psychological training that Brennan seems to continually respect: his ability to discern lies, acknowledging that physical reactions can indicate dishonesty. Her respect for this ability is most apparent at the end of \\"The Tough Man in the Tender Chicken\\", when she suggests using Sweets as a \\"human polygraph test\\" in Booth's place when they realize that Booth's own ability to detect dishonesty has been compromised since his coma. When Booth tells Brennan that his marksmanship skill has fallen since his coma, she immediately suggests talking to Sweets and later tells Sweets of the many discrepancies in Booth's behavior since the coma. Brennan continued to see Sweets as a family friend even after starting a family with Booth. He stayed with them for several months after he broke up with Daisy and when he was about to move into his new apartment, Brennan expressed her sadness that Sweets would no longer be there to help babysit Christine or share his recipes. When Booth was wrongfully imprisoned after the season 9 finale, Sweets took over Booth's fatherly duties and regularly took Christine to the park and also helped Brennan move into the new house.  Dr. Gordon Wyatt  Sweets has developed a friendly relationship with Dr. Gordon Wyatt, who in turn mentors Sweets and offers him guidance at times. Gordon has shown great respect for Sweets and his skill as a psychologist. Gordon also seems to be fairly protective of Sweets, particularly during \\"Mayhem on a Cross\\". Through Sweets' manuscript, Gordon was able to deduce that Sweets himself had been abused as a child and was adopted by an elderly couple who had recently died. He tells Sweets that he has a good heart and a genuine desire to help others that makes psychology his true calling, something that Gordon himself does not have. Later in the episode, while he is preparing a dinner for Brennan and Booth, he tells them of Sweets' past and encourages them to include him in their surrogate family. =Romances= Sweets dated April, a tropical fish specialist, until she broke up with him in \\"The Man in the Mud\\". Daisy Wick Sweets begins dating one of Dr. Temperance Brennan's interns, Daisy Wick, after meeting her during a case. He is initially drawn to her by the fact that she minored in psychology and later, after Booth and Brennan avoid another therapy session, calls her. At the end of \\"The Skull in the Sculpture\\", Sweets insists on personally breaking the news to her when Cam decides to fire her, telling Daisy that the upside of it is that they no longer must be discreet about their relationship. When Daisy confesses she thought that Sweets was ashamed of her, he kisses her in front of the entire team, surprising them all greatly. In \\"The Cinderella In The Cardboard\\", Daisy is viewed fitting a wedding dress with an unknown male by Booth and Brennan. After much deliberation, Sweets confronts her, at which point they quickly resolve the fact that Daisy is not having an affair, and she was simply fitting the dress for her cousin, and the unknown male was her cousin's fianc√©. At that point, Daisy closes the blinds to Sweets's office and they begin disrobing as the camera pans to another point of view. In \\"Night in the Bones Museum\\", Sweets intercedes on Daisy's behalf and persuades Dr Brennan to offer Daisy another chance at the internship although she has been fired twice already; although not from lack of ability but rather the fact that she is \\"annoying\\". He teaches her breathing techniques to make her less so, but she begins to resent his constant presence at the lab. He realizes that his trying to change her was insulting, and resolves that if she ever fails in future, he will just \\"give [her] a hug\\". Daisy and Sweets then have sex in the Egyptology department. In \\"The Bones On The Blue Line\\", Sweets proposes to Daisy, and she accepts. Though when she decides to go to the Maluku Islands on a year-long anthropological dig, they break up when he refuses to join her. However, in the episode \\"The Shallow in the Deep\\", Daisy and Sweets are revealed to have been having casual sex; Booth and Brennan accidentally stumbled on them having sex in Sweets' office as Booth needed Sweets to sign his ready-for-duty form. Sweets realizes that he wants a stable relationship, and he and Daisy reconnect in a bar by realizing that they are not so different after all. They are shown near the end of the episode kissing. Later on in the season it is revealed that Sweets is planning on proposing to Daisy again. Daisy's nickname for Lance is her \\"Sweet Lancelot\\", a reference to his name, Lance Sweets, and to the romantic character, Lancelot, of Arthurian myth. Sweets also sometimes refers to Daisy as \\"Miss Daisy\\", also using the phrase \\"What are you driving at, Miss Daisy?\\" in reference to the film, \\"Driving Miss Daisy\\". In the Season 8 episode \\"The Gunk in the Garage\\", Sweets turns down a fellow FBI agent, Olivia Sparling, who is obviously interested in him, citing his serious relationship with Daisy; however, in the following episode, \\"The Tiger in the Tale\\", he and Daisy encounter trouble in their relationship. Sweets and Daisy plan to finally move in together and rent an apartment. Though both are excited about this at first, after talking with both Angela and Booth, Sweets begins to second-guess living with Daisy, realizing that, though she wants to eventually get married, and even someday start a family; all the things he wasn't entirely sure about yet. As a result, Sweets, despite feeling bad, breaks off their relationship, and allows Daisy to keep the apartment. Though the two had a moment of reminiscing, they remained friends. Before the end of the season, Sweets actually thought Daisy missed him. She was flattered and admitted she missed him and the sex, a little. In the Season 10 premiere, it is revealed that he and Daisy reconnected over the past year. The reconciliation of their relationship resulted in her pregnancy. She's seen approximately 5 months pregnant with their son; whom she calls \\"Little Lance\\" affectionately. Sweets is killed later in the episode. One of his last thoughts was of Daisy and he requested Dr. Brennan to tell her \\"not to worry\\", stating she worried too much. Prior to his death, Sweets and Daisy ask Booth to be their unborn son's godfather, and Sweets even wanted to name the baby 'Seeley'. Characterization Lance Sweets is brought into the series early in the third season (\\"The Secret in the Soil\\") as a psychologist to Seeley Booth and Temperance Brennan. The FBI forced them to seek therapy because Booth had arrested Brennan's father and the FBI was considering severing their partnership. Sweets' presence provides a bit of comic relief, as he is often the target of insults from both his clients, though they do show sympathy for him on occasion. His youth (according to Angela, Sweets needs to show his ID at bars to drink) and inexperience with police work also prove to be a challenge for him in the series, as many don't take him seriously, although his psychological analysis of Booth and Brennan is typically quite accurate. Booth is very suspicious of his ability to predict behavior using psychoanalysis, calling it \\"Jedi mind tricks\\". Also, while able to quickly recognize when someone is lying (Booth has described him as a \\"portable polygraph\\"), he himself does not appear to be very good at lying; when he lied about his personal life in \\"Double Trouble in the Panhandle\\", both Booth and Brennan were able to tell easily. Sweets is characterized as extremely intelligent and he has often been able to provide much-needed insight into a case when the Jeffersonian team hit a dead end with physical evidence. He is generally well-liked and valued by the \\"squints\\" despite Brennan's dislike of psychology and Hodgins' incessant jibes about his youthful appearance. Hodgins, Angela and Cam have all asked him for advice at least once in the show. Besides his academic intellect and skill as a profiler, Sweets has various interests outside of psychology. A skilled chess player, he was also one of the youngest chessmasters in the federation which he was a member of during his college days. He is musically-inclined and plays the piano (as does actor John Francis Daley); in during the time frame between Seasons 5 and 6 he takes a sabbatical when Booth, Brennan, Angela, Hodgins and Daisy leave Washington DC for a year and becomes a freelance pianist. He is also well-read and familiar with William Shakespeare. In the season 4 finale, \\"The End in the Beginning\\", he is presented as a bartender (\\"practically a psychologist\\") and the lead singer and keyboardist of a band called \\"Gormogon\\", a reference to a character in a previous story arc. He states he is not Gormogon and that it is simply a name; this may be a nod to a belief that many fans held that Sweets was, in fact, Gormogon. Even in this alternate world, Booth is still a father figure to Sweets, giving him the opportunity to audition at the nightclub, and Sweets is still in a relationship with Daisy. He is also protective of Brennan, having burnt evidence that he thought would implicate her. Death In the final moments of the premiere episode of season 10, \\"The Conspiracy in the Corpse\\", Booth and Bones arrive to a parking garage after Booth received a distress call from junior FBI agent James Aubrey. They arrive to find Sweets lying on the ground, bloodied and bruised. Also on the scene is Aubrey, who arrived moments after the incident, after hearing the shots Sweets fired at his assailant. After a brief discussion between Booth, Bones and a fading Sweets, he finally succumbs to his wounds and dies as an ambulance is heard arriving in the background. His last words to Brennan and Booth, are \\"The world is a lot better than you think it is.

Records in 1992. It was Khan's first studio album since 1988's CK and due to artistic differences between Khan and Warner Bros. Records it was also to be her final full-length release for the label. The entire album is dedicated to her friend Miles Davis, who died the previous year. Composition The album mainly focuses on material from the contemporary R&B;, soul and funk genres and was Khan's debut as executive producer in charge of production. The main producer on the album was the Grammy Award winning jazz multi-instrumentalist Marcus Miller but it also includes Khan's first collaborations with Arif Mardin since 1986's Destiny; \\"This Time\\" and the closing track \\"Don't Look at Me That Way\\", both co- produced by Mardin's son Joe Mardin. \\"Love You All My Lifetime\\" saw Khan teaming up with Scritti Politti's David Gamson ‚Äì who incidentally had also produced the opening track on Destiny with its confusingly similar title; \\"Love of a Lifetime\\". The single track \\"I Want\\" features a guest appearance by William Galison on harmonica and the suggestive ballad \\"You Can Make the Story Right\\" was recorded with bassist and producer Wayne Braithwaite, best known for his work with Will Downing and Kenny G. Singles The Woman I Am includes six single releases; \\"Love You All My Lifetime\\" written by German composer duo Klarmann/Weber which became a number one on Billboard's Dance Singles chart as well as #2 on R&B; (Pop #68, UK #49), \\"You Can Make the Story Right\\" written by Gabrielle Goodman & Wayne Bathwaite reached #8 on the US R&B; Billboard charts, \\"I Want\\" (US R&B; #62), \\"Give Me All\\", \\"Facts of Love\\" and the Diane Warren-penned ballad \\"Don't Look at Me That Way\\" (UK #73). Both lead single \\"Love You All My Lifetime\\" and \\"Give Me All\\" were issued in a wide variety of dance remixes by among others Frankie Knuckles. Commercial success The Woman I Am became Khan's highest-charting album on the US R&B; Albums chart since 1984's I Feel for You, peaking at #9. The album won Khan a Grammy Award for Best R&B; Vocal Performance, Female in 1993. Since Khan's 1995 album Dare You to Love Me was shelved by the Warner Bros. Records label and instead only partly made available on greatest hits compilations and movie soundtracks, it was to be six years before she released another full-length album, the Prince co-produced Come 2 My House on his label NPG Records. As of 2005, The Woman I Am has sold 197,000 copies in United States according to Nielsen SoundScan. Critical reception In his review of The Woman I Am, AllMusic's Alex Henderson describes the album as \\"high-tech, yet warm instead of mechanical. And on songs ranging from the melancholy \\"Telephone\\" to the introspective title song and the appealing single \\"Love You All My Lifetime,\\" it's clear that Khan was given strong material to work with.\\"[ AllMusic review, Alex Henderson] Track listing #\\"Everything Changes\\" (Khan, Ben Marguiles) ‚Äì 4:38 #\\"Give Me All\\" (Jerry Barnes, Katreese Barnes) ‚Äì 4:24 #\\"Telephone\\" (Hans-J√ºrgen Buchner, Khan) ‚Äì 4:21 #\\"Keep Givin' Me Lovin'\\" (Camus Mare Celli, Khan, Andres Levin, Mica Paris) ‚Äì 4:32 #\\"Facts of Love\\" (Werner Hammer, Khan, Harald Schneck, Ralf Zang) ‚Äì 4:35 #\\"Love You All My Lifetime\\" (Irmgard Klarmann, Felix Weber) ‚Äì 4:43 #\\"I Want\\" (Donald D.

It is notable for being the first museum to be established in the province of Negros Occidental. History The Balay Negrense was originally the ancestral house of Victor F. Gaston, a son of Yves Leopold Germain Gaston and Prudencia Fernandez. The elder Gaston is credited as one of the pioneers of sugarcane cultivation in this portion of the Philippine archipelago. A native of Normandy in France, he married a Filipina from Batangas where he initially began experimenting with sugar production before relocating to Negros. Built in 1897, the house was constructed when Victor Gaston's wife died and during the time when he was residing in his father's hacienda, Hacienda Buen Retiro. The structure housed Victor Gaston and his twelve children from 1901 until his death in 1927. Left unused by the family, the structure was abandoned in the mid-1970s and fell into disrepair until one of the heirs, Msgr. Guillermo Ma. Gaston, together with a group of concerned Negrenses formed what would later become the Negros Cultural Foundation. In 1992, Msgr. Guillermo Ma. Gaston donated the Victor Gaston house to the Philippine Tourism Authority (now known as the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority). With donations from prominent individuals and a PhP5,000,000.00 assistance from the Philippine Tourism Authority, the structure was repaired and furnished with period furniture and fixtures. The museum was officially inaugurated on October 6, 1990. Pursuant to Board Resolution No. 1 dated March 8, 1994 of the National Historical Institute of the Philippines (National Historical Commission of the Philippines), it was listed as a heritage house. Architecture The house is of the type called Bahay na bato, literally \\"house of stone\\", however, reflecting American colonial influences, the lower storey is not constructed of stone but of concrete. The foundation posts are made out of trunks of the balayong tree, a local hardwood; the floorboards are of the same material. The house's upper storey is constructed of wood topped with a roof of galvanized iron instead of tile (reflecting the late-19th century trend started in Manila owing to a rule discouraging the use of tiles in favor of then-novel hiero as roofing material in the aftermath of the 1880 Luzon earthquakes). Second Floor of Balay Negrense The marker of Balay Negrense. The house has a four-metre high ceiling and large windows with ventanillas, smaller windows beneath the large windows with sliding panels that can be opened to admit the wind. The lower storey itself is elevated from ground level by a metre-high crawlspace, allowing the wooden foundations to be aired, preventing dampness from rotting the wood.

Use of these materials constitutes the next level of difficulty after those of practical life. Like many other materials in the Montessori classroom, sensorial materials have what is called \\"control of error\\", meaning that the child not only works with the material, but has a way to check their work rather than seeking out the teacher if they have a question on whether or not they did it right. This is done to help promote independence and problem solving on the part of the child.  Cylinder blocks  The cylinder blocks are ten wooden cylinders of various dimensions that can be removed from a fitted container block using a knobbed handle. To remove the cylinders, the child tends to naturally use the same three-finger grip used to hold pencils. Several activities can be done with the cylinder blocks. The main activity involves removing the cylinders from the block and replacing them again in the spot that one got them from. The control of error is constituted in the child's inability to replace a cylinder in the wrong hole.  Pink tower  The pink tower has ten pink cubes of different sizes, from 1 centimeter up to 10 cm in increments of 1 cm. The work is designed to provide the child with a concept of \\"big\\" and \\"small.\\" The child starts with the largest cube and puts the second-largest cube on top of it. This continues until all ten cubes are stacked on top of each other. The control of error is visual. The child sees the cubes are in the wrong order and knows that they should fix them. The successive dimensions of each cube are such that if the cubes are stacked flush with a corner, the smallest cube may be fit squarely on the ledge of each level  Broad stair  The broad stair (also called Brown Stair) is designed to teach the concepts of \\"thick\\" and \\"thin\\". It comprises ten sets of wooden prisms with a natural or brown stain finish. Each stair is 20 cm in length and varies in thickness from 1 to 10 cm. When put together from thickest to thinnest, they make an even staircase. As an extension, the broad stairs are often used with the pink tower to allow the child to make many designs. Image:PinkTowerandBroadStairs.jpgThe pink tower and the broad stair are shown here together in an extension activity. Image:BrownStairsAndPinkTower2.JPGThe child can make a variety of designs limited only by his or her imagination and the constraints of the material.  Red rods  The red rods are rods with a square cross section, varying only in length. The smallest is 10 cm long and the largest is one meter long. Each rod is 2.5 cm/1inch square. By holding the ends of the rods with two hands, the material is designed to give the child a sense of long and short.  Colored cylinders  Also called the knobless cylinders, the colored cylinders are exactly the same dimensions as the cylinder blocks mentioned above. There are 4 boxes of cylinders: * Yellow cylinders that vary in height and width. The shortest cylinder is the thinnest and the tallest cylinder is the thickest. * Red cylinders that are the same height, but vary in width. * Blue cylinders that have the same width, but vary in height. * Green cylinders that vary in height and width. The shortest cylinder is the thickest and the tallest cylinder is the thinnest. The child can do a variety of exercises with these materials, including matching them with the cylinder blocks, stacking them on top of each other to form a tower, and arranging them in size or different patterns. When the yellow, red, and green cylinders are placed on top of each other, they all are the same height. Image:ColoredCylinders2.JPGColored Cylinders laid out in a design. Image:ColoredCylinders1.JPGThe green, yellow, and red cylinders are stacked on top of each other. Image:ColoredCylinders3.JPGHere, the knobless cylinders are used with the cylinders from the cylinder block.  Binomial cube  The binomial cube is a cube that has the following pieces: one red cube, three black and red prisms, three black and blue prisms, and one blue cube. A box with eight prisms represent the elements of (a+b)^3 or: a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3 The pieces are stored in a box with two hinged opening sides. The color pattern of the cube is painted all around the outside of the box (except the bottom). The material is not designed for math education until the elementary years of Montessori education. In the primary levels (ages 3-6), it is used as sensorial material. File:Binomokubo.JPGThe Binomial Cube  Trinomial cube  The trinomial cube is similar to the binomial cube, but has the following pieces instead: *1 red cube and 6 black and red prisms (varying in size) *1 blue cube and 6 black and blue prisms (varying in size) *1 yellow cube and 6 black and yellow prisms (varying in size) *6 black prisms (same size) This is similar to the binomial cube, but is a physical representation of this formula: (a+b+c)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3a^2c + b^3 + 3ab^2 + 3b^2c + c^3 + 3ac^2 + 3bc^2 + 6abc  Other materials  There are many Montessori sensorial materials, and more are being investigated and developed by teachers around the world. Other popular Montessori sensorial materials include: ; Monomial cube : A cube similar to the binomial and trinomial cube. The child has a sensorial experience of the power of multiplying by two and developing that into a cube. ; Geometric cabinet : Several different shapes are inset into wood and placed in drawers. The child distinguishes the different shapes, learns their names, and learns how to discriminate from the shapes. ; The constructive triangles : Different triangles are put together to form various shapes. Shapes made with the triangles include the parallelogram, hexagon, rhombus, and trapezoid. ; Color tablets : Boxes with tablets inside. The sides are usually made of wood or plastic. The middle is painted wood or plastic. The only difference between them is the colors in the middle. There are three color boxes. The first has the three primary colors (red, blue, and yellow). The second has 12 different colors. The third box has nine colors, but in different grades from light to dark. ; Geometric solids : Ten Geometric three- dimensional shapes made from wood and usually painted blue. The shapes are: :* Sphere :* Cone :* Ovoid :* Ellipsoid :* Triangle-based pyramid :* Square-based pyramid :* Cube :* Cylinder :* Rectangular prism :* Triangular prism ; The mystery bag : The mystery bag contains various object that the child feels and sorts without looking into the bag. The object is removed after the child has decided how to sort it and a visual check is done. (Though this may also be done blindfolded to add to the experience). ; Rough and smooth boards : Sandpaper is glued onto a smooth wood board. Various grading of sandpaper are used later as an extension of this activity to help the child discriminate between them. ; Fabric box : Different fabric materials are used that the child must feel and match. A blindfold is usually used so the child cannot see the materials. ; Thermic bottles: Water of different temperatures is added to metal bottles. The child lines them up from hottest to coldest. ; Baric tablets : Wooden tablets of various weight to help the child discriminate between weight. ; Sound cylinders : Two boxes, each containing six cylinders. One set has a red top and the other a blue top. When shaken, each cylinder of the same color gives off a different sound. The sound from the red cylinder is matched with the same exact sound from the blue cylinder. ; Bells : Twenty-six bells are used to help develop a sense of musical tones.

They consist of a steel pipe, an insulating layer, and an outer casing. The main purpose of such pipes is to maintain the temperature of the fluid in the pipes. A common application is the hot water from district heating plants. Most commonly used are single insulated pipes, but more recently in Europe it is becoming popular to use two pipes insulated within the same casing. By using insulated pipe supports, direct heat transfer between pipes and their supports are prevented.Insulated Supports Piping Technology & Products, retrieved March 2012 The insulating material usually used is polyurethane foam or similar, with a coefficient of thermal conductivity k=0.033-0.024 W/mK (thermal conductivity). Outer casing is usually high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Production of preinsulated pipes for district heating in the European Union is regulated by the standard EN253. According to EN253:2003, pipes must be produced to work at constant temperature of for 30 years, keeping thermal conductivity less than or equal to 0.033 W/mK. There are three insulation thickness levels. Insulated pipelines are usually assembled from pipes of , , or in length, laid underground in depth . Efficient working life of district heating pipelines networks is estimated at 25‚Äì30 years, after which they need to be replaced with new pipes.

He rose through the ranks to command a division in the Cavalry Corps of the Army of Tennessee in the last days of the war. Early life and career William W. Allen was born in New York City, New York to Wade Hampton Allen, a successful businessman with agricultural interests in the South, and Eliza Sayre Allen on September 11, 1835.Warner, Ezra J. Generals in Gray: Lives of the Confederate Commanders. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1959. . p. 5. Shortly after his birth, the family moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where he was educated before entering Princeton College in New Jersey. After graduation in 1854, he studied law, but chose instead to return to plantation life. On August 13, 1857, in Montgomery, he married Susan P. Ball (1840‚Äì1915), and they raised eleven children.Banta, Theodore M., Sayre Family: Lineage of Thomas Sayre, a Founder of Southampton. New York: De Vinne Press, 1901. p. 502. Civil War service After Alabama passed its Ordinance of Secession and Fort Sumter was fired upon, Allen enlisted in the newly raised Confederate army and was elected as a lieutenant in Company A, Montgomery Mounted Rifles. The following year, when the state organized the 1st Alabama Cavalry, Allen became its first major on March 18, 1862, and saw action at the Battle of Shiloh in April along the Tennessee River. He was subsequently promoted to colonel of the regiment before the Kentucky Campaign, and led the 1st Alabama Cavalry at the Battle of Perryville, where he received a slight wound.Sifakis, Stewart. Who Was Who in the Civil War. New York: Facts On File, 1988. . p. 8. Later that year, he was severely wounded in the Battle of Murfreesboro while in command of a brigade.Evans, Clement A., \\"Alabama & Mississippi by General Joseph Wheeler,\\" Confederate Military History: Vol. XII. Atlanta: Confederate Publishing Company, 1899. pp. 385, 86. Out of action for over a year while recuperating from surgery which left him little use of his right hand, Allen returned to field duty in early 1864.Welsh, Jack D. Medical Histories of Confederate Generals. Kent, OH: Kent State University Press, 1995. . Retrieved June 20, 2015. p. 5. On February 26 of that year, he was promoted to brigadier general and took command of a brigade of cavalry at Dalton, Georgia. His brigade was composed of the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 9th, 12th, and 51st Alabama Cavalry regiments, and they served in the corps of Joseph Wheeler in the Army of Tennessee. Allen led the brigade throughout the Alabama Campaign. In August, a Georgia cavalry brigade was added to Allen's force, and later, Anderson's Brigade. Allen, now in charge of a full division, participated in the Atlanta Campaign in the summer, as well as contesting Sherman's March to the Sea (Savannah Campaign). Although Confederate President Jefferson Davis appointed him a major general in February, 1865, the Confederate Senate did not confirm his promotion before that body met for the last time. In early 1865, Allen's Division fought in the Carolinas Campaign. Allen and his men surrendered at Concord, North Carolina, on May 3. He was paroled shortly thereafter as a brigadier general. Postbellum career Allen returned home to Alabama and resumed his agricultural pursuits. He was also involved in the railroad industry and later served as the state's Adjutant General during the administration of President Grover Cleveland.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 102. He also was for a time a United States Marshal in Alabama. Allen helped found and organize the Confederate Survivors Association of Montgomery. His bullet-holed uniform coat and his battle-flag are buried in the cornerstone of the Confederate monument in Montgomery.Banta, 1901, 503. In 1893, William W. Allen moved to Sheffield, Alabama, where he died of heart disease the following year. He is buried in Birmingham's Elmwood Cemetery. The Maj. Gen.

It was established in 1978. Before its deregistration, it was the oldest political party in Sabah that was currently still in existence. Despite being a party that maintains a Kadazan-Dusun ethnocentric platform, membership is opened to all ethnicities and the party's leadership has multi-ethnic representation.PASOK: Party Leadership The term Nunukragang refers to Nunuk Ragang, the traditional birthplace of the Kadazan-Dusun culture and civilisation.  Political platform  PASOK subscribes to a 7-point political platform:PASOK: Aims and Objectives * To foster and to promote national unity and harmony amongst the indigenous people of Sabah; * To instill and promote mutual confidence and goodwill amongst the people of Sabah irrespective of race and religion; * To safeguard and to protect the rightful position, rights and knowledge of the indigenous people of Sabah; * To uphold and to promote the 5 principles of the Rukun Negara as National Philosophy. * To safeguard and promote the traditional customs and cultures of the Indigenous people and to preserve the freedom of worship; * To uphold and promote the principles of parliamentary and democratic form of government through harmony and consensus. * To work with other political organisations with similar aims and objectives within Malaysia so as to uphold the healthy development of party politics.  History  PASOK was established in 1978 by the brother of O.K.K Sedomon Gunsanad, G. S. Sundang, a traditional chief (bearing the title Orang Kaya Kaya) and former Deputy Chief Minister of the Sabah as a political vehicle for the Kadazan, Dusun, and Murut peoples. In 1985, PASOK joined the newly formed Sabah United Party (PBS) in a coalition government after the latter won the 1985 state legislative elections. PASOK won its only seat in the state legislature to date when the then party president, Ignatius Stephen Malanjum, won the Moyog state constituency. = Recent developments = PASOK was denied the opportunity to contest with its own name and symbol in the 2008 general elections due to an ongoing feud involving rival claimants to the party presidency. PASOK candidates that were originally slated to stand either chose to stand as independent candidates or dropped out from the elections. On 28 February 2008, the Registrar of Societies issued a revocation of registration notice to PASOK citing the failure of the party to resolve their leadership crisis involving Cleftus Mojinggol, John Richard Jayasuria and Hendry Sabagang Rumpit who had all claimed the party's presidency. The party was then de- registered on 27 May although one of the claimants claimed that he had yet to receive the notice from the Registrar and that the party leadership crisis had been solved following a delegate's conference that had elected new office bearers on 23 May 2008. The party was deregistered in 2008.  Prominent members  While not having had much electoral success, PASOK has seen many prominent members of Sabahan society go through its ranks: * G. S.

Plot George T. Edison (Boothe) is an oddball inventor who hears with his teeth instead of his ears as a result of a bizarre childhood train accident. By day he toils away in his cluttered laboratory, and by night he listens to phonograph records by chewing on the giant metal horn that conducts the sound. At his home at Pickerton Park, He works with his companion, Batchelor (McNeil), to find many ideas for inventions. He lives happily with his father, Captain Samuel Edison, his wife, Lotte Edison, and his two sons, Leo and Faraday Edison. One day, George invites a married foreign couple to have a look at his ancient artifacts. He introduces them by using a phonograph that plays the melodious voice of his wife. George, the womanizer he is, falls in love with the veiled foreign lady and likes her exotic dance. At night, George was talking with the foreigners about his collection of sacred treasures. One of the treasures was called a poisonous weapon called the Viper Knife. The knife was used to cut a woman's bottom lip to tell if she has been cheating on her husband. If it bleeds, then she was cheating. The married couple decides to leave, but the lady gives George a note that says to \\"Meet Here At Midnight\\" (kiss). Meanwhile in Leo's room, Leo and Faraday were arguing about their father's inventions. Lotte (Terzo) comes in the room and orders Faraday to return to his room. Lotte tells a bedtime story to Leo while Faraday overhears them. Many situations had happened immediately after the visit from the married foreign couple. Samuel Edison (Brazeau), Leo's courageous grandfather, visits Leo and tells many stories about his adventures with monsters. Leo eventually falls asleep and his grandpa leaves. Lotte decides to clean many furniture around the house and gets her bed ready. However, a mysterious person has ambushed her. Meanwhile, George sets up an alarm for midnight and places the note next to it. He decided to use his zoetrope to pass the time. He picks out a set of pictures and places them in order. Using his hand, he spun the wheel once and it showed a revealing belly dancer. By using his teeth, he was able to hear the instrument playing while watching the belly dancer move. The belly dancer's gyrating caused George to hallucinate. The sexy belly dancer approaches him with lustful eyes. George was about to give in until the alarm set off. He was ready to meet the lady. George goes to his ancient artifact collection and sees a lifeless body that looked like the foreign lady. He sees a note that talks about the Viper Knife. George panics and cuts off the lips with the knife. It was not until he realizes that the dead body was his own wife. Meanwhile, the married couple has achieved the knife and left the residency. The couple were fakes. The lady, Toni, and her daughter, Zella, demanded money for their work. The man betrays them and throws them off the railroad tracks. Angered, Toni (Samuda) wanted revenge on the Edisons. After finding Bachelor, George takes Lotta's body to the Pasannas, a primitive Amazoness tribe that uses magic and spells that is sourced from the sacred Book Of Light, a book full of creative ideas. The old chief partially restores Lotte and orders George to rest her next to the Book Of Light. Full of greed, George steals the treasure and escapes with Bachelor and Lotte back to their home. The Pasannas chase after them, however, an electric fence blocks their entry. Using the book, George had the idea to use an electric tower to fully restore his wife. However, Lotte goes berserk and almost kills Bachelor and George. Leo becomes worried and goes out of his window. Leo comes out and his mother comes back to her senses. Happily reunited, they hold hands and a lightning bolt shocks them. The shock killed Lotte and made Leo unconscious. After the Pasannas failed, they accepted Toni and Zella into their tribe. George is sure that his latest invention is the one that will cement him as a true genius. Eager to get the ball rolling, George hastily recruits his unconscious son Leo to assist in his latest experiment without considering the consequences. As the experiment gets underway, however, something goes horribly awry and Leo is electrified. Now Leo is unable to touch another human without fear of delivering a deadly jolt. At Leo's birthday, Edison lies to Leo about his mother's death and gave him robotic friends. Leo becomes annoyed and goes to a statue of his mother to relieve himself. Faraday becomes angry that he cannot be a soldier and fight the Pasannas. After a timeskip, everyone grew older. Leo (Smith) becomes lonely at his school until the lovely Zella (Pope) zaps into his life. Zella is the first person with the power to see past Leo's electrified fa√ßade, and as such she may just be his ticket to true happiness. Meanwhile, George was having an affair with Toni and she was disguised as a seamstress. Toni wants George to tell his secrets, but he refuses. After Toni leaves, George sees that Leo falls in love with Zella. George thinks of a plan to subdue Leo's sexual desires. Using George's newly-invented kinetoscope, Leo was able to view a belly dancer move. George believes Leo would find her dance quite exquisite. George explains that he can do experimentations on Leo to remove the vision of enticing lures and features from females. He strips away the attractive belly dancer until she becomes only a skeleton. Leo, disgusted, refuses and thought the experiment would be horrible. Samuel Edison agrees and believes you cannot take a man's pride. Faraday (Cotton) still argues with George and believes that he can fight him. George easily defeats his son and his son decides to leave. Toni sees Faraday leaving and has a plan to get revenge on George. She persuades him to get secrets about the fuse box to disable the electric fence. Faraday agrees with the plan. Meanwhile, Leo decides to go with Zella to find out about his mother's death. With the help of Leo's electric superpowers, they were able to arrive at the Pasannas efficiently. The elder chief gives the true backstory about his mom's death. Going back to home, Leo and Zella puts on a movie about Lotte's true death. George comments that it was not true abd falls in love with Zella. An enraged Leo decides that he wants to abandon his life at the Edisons. Zella comes over to meet with Leo's father in which he happily accepts. After seeing Leo and Edison's soldiers leave for the sauna, Faraday bakes a pie drugged with sleeping liquid. George attempts to pursue Zella and she luckily escapes. Faraday gives George the pie and George at the whole pie. George becomes tired and goes to his bedroom. Faraday asks George about the fuse box and George still refuses. Faraday becomes angry and decides to try to cut down the electricity by himself. The fuse box was next to George's bedroom. After forgetting something, Leo goes back to his room and goes up to see mother's statue. He sees Faraday trying to find the fuse box and argues with him. Leo leaves and becomes so enraged that he was able to control his electric powers. Zella goes out to find her mother and learns the whole truth about trying to kill the Edisons for good. Zella panics and tries to find Leo. Faraday decides to go down to his father's lab and uses a wrench to jam the power supply. It works and the power goes out. The Pasannas see the power goes out and pursues to save their treasure. The Pasannas took down Batchelor and the soldiers at the sauna. A disgusted Leo sees this and was concerned for the safety of Zella. He immediately goes back to his home. Samuel Edison and his men try to fight the Pasannas, but without vision they were killed off. Leo finds George at his lab and sees that George has gone insane. Zella sees Leo and warns Leo to be careful fighting his father. Faraday sees his dying grandfather and takes his sword to become a fighter. Leo was about to kill his father until Faraday arrives and beheads him. George's head tells Faraday that he was proud and immediately dies. Toni decides to bring the head back to the tribe. The elder chief takes back the Book Of Light and regains her powers. The statue of Leo's mom talks to Leo and Leo was happy to hear her mother's voice. Even though George was killed, the teenagers were shocked to find out that there was another George. However, this George was a robot and took the memories that lead up to his own death. Faraday screams and George decides that he will try to find inventions to save humanity. Leo and Zella choose to go west and live their own lives together. Voice cast *Powers Boothe ... George T.

In the early 20th century, Ry√¥ji Noda, secretary consulate in both Peru and Brazil and expert advisor to the Japanese government on immigration to South America, was assigned to survey Colombia. On his return to Japan, he presented a report of his tour of Colombia to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This geographical area of Colombia would be occupied by Japanese farmers twenty years later. In 1920, the Farmers Society of Colombia sent a proposal to the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Agriculture and Trade, drawing the government's attention to the lack of agricultural workers. Following this, Colombian President Rafael Reyes offered to travel and make contracts himself. Colombia broke diplomatic relations with Japan after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Japanese community meetings in Barranquilla were suspended, as it was forbidden for more than three Japanese people to be gathered at a time. Those living in Valle del Cauca lost their right to roam freely and could only be out under police supervision. Colombia allowed the reinstatement of all officials of the Japanese Legation and of other residents throughout the United States. Thirteen Latin American countries, including Colombia, cooperated with the U.S. in the capture and deportation of citizens of Axis countries. Some immigrants from the El Jagual neighborhood and a few others from Barranquilla were arrested and taken to the Sabaneta Hotel in Fusagasug√°. The hotel was converted into an internment camp for Japanese, Italian and German citizens until World War II ended in Europe and Asia. Japanese people were the last to leave detention centers, being released on September 6, 1945, four days after General MacArthur accepted Japan's formal declaration of defeat. For Japanese residents of Colombia, World War II caused the separation of families and economic struggle. Many people refused to shop at Japanese- owned businesses and Japanese Columbians were met in public with offensive language. They became a vulnerable ethnic minority that was seen as strange and undesirable and they were often subject to mistreatment by the government and by the Colombian people.  History  =First encounters (1903‚Äì1910) = According to Toraji Irie‚Äôs work on Japanese immigration overseas, Colombia lost control of the Isthmus of Panama in 1903, creating a sense of worry about the eminent threat of American intervention. In order to protect the country from this, Colombia began soliciting the help of a number of different countries, including Japan. It is inferred that they came from correspondence with a reporter at the time. After diplomatic visits and correspondence between the governments, Antonio Izquierdo visited Japan in 1908. It is presumed that the solicitation of agricultural help from Japan enabled the migration of at least 100,000 workers. During his visit to Japan, Izquierdo reported that referendum contracts were signed, in which it was expected that only two Japanese commissioners would be sent to study the living and work situation in Colombia, with the objective of promoting the immigration of their natives to said country. Instead of mentioning the possible number of emigrants, he went on to only mention a single gardener, Tomohiro Kawaguchi, as the first Japanese immigrant to Colombia whose name and trade is known. It is also known that he worked on the embellishment of the San Diego Forest, owned by Antonio Izquierdo, where the Industrial Exhibition of 1910 took place. At the end of the exhibition, the property became known as . Flag of Japan Flag of Colombia Following their Treaty of Friendship, commerce and navigation between the two nations was ratified on 10 December 1908. The Japanese government complied with Izquierdo's request to send a representative to investigate the conditions of the country with a view to future emigration. A newspaper in Tokyo had published a note in which it mentioned that despite having passed a year since the signing of the Treaty and not having yet begun commercial and diplomatic relations, it was expected the future development of emigration would be a success. Noda, who was secretary consulate in both Peru and Brazil, as well as an expert adviser to the Japanese government on matters of immigration to South America, was entrusted with the mission to survey Colombia. On his return to Japan, he presented a report of his tour of Colombia to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of his government. Noda refrained from recommending emigration to Colombia for several reasons, among others: the lack of a direct navigation route, which would make the trip very long and expensive; the poor internal communication conditions in Colombia, which would make it difficult to enter and leave the country; the enormous expanse occupied by rugged mountains; the lack of variety of agricultural products, and the periodic floods in the fertile zones of the Magdalena and Cauca rivers. Noda predicted, however, that if emigration to Colombia were to be achieved in the future, he would see the south of the Cauca Valley, especially the part between Santander de Quilichao to the south and Cartago to the north, as a promising region. This geographical area of Colombia would be the one that would be occupied by Japanese farmers twenty years later. The negative report of Noda coincidentally added to the political crisis that the country was suffering in, due to the abandonment of power of General Rafael Reyes, under whose presidency the treaty had been signed between the two countries, came to light. = Immigration to Colombia (1929‚Äì1960) = The issue of looking for workers in Japan resumed in 1920, when President Reyes of Colombia offered to travel and make contracts himself. This was due to the proposal that the Farmers Society of Colombia sent to the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Agriculture and Trade, drawing the government's attention to the lack of agricultural workers due to the increase in workers in the railroads. The Society proposed to the government to go to Japan to negotiate this matter, given that \\"Japanese immigration seems to be the most appropriate for Colombia\\". The mission never happened and the matter was closed. In 1926, the Overseas Emigration Company from Fukuoka commissioned two of their employees, Y√ªz√¥ Takeshima and Tokuhisa Makijima, to make an exploratory trip through Colombia in search of an appropriate place to establish an agricultural colony. Takahiko Wakabayashi, the Japanese consul in Panama, accompanied them on the tour they made, among other places, through Bogot√°, Medell√≠n and Barranquilla, the Sabana de Bogot√°, the valleys of Cauca and Magdalena. Their visit to Colombia was made in private, without having any contact with the Ministry of Industries that had the faculty to approve projects for future immigrants, nor did they request vacant lots for future immigrants as they had previously done. Upon his return to Tokyo, the emigration company submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the reports of the first and a second trip to Colombia to obtain the approval of the emigration project; Once this was obtained, the company, with the advice it received from Japanese emigrants based in Cali and Palmira, bought land in the department of Cauca to establish the agricultural program with the first ten families of emigrants. It was not easy for the emigration company to find families willing to emigrate. This was understandable, since Colombia was then an unknown country in Fukuoka and, up to then, there had been no one who had returned to tell their experiences, nor were there letters from previous emigrants. \\"Immigrants who had succeeded usually encouraged their relatives, neighbors, and friends to share their good fortune,\\" Staniford said in his study of a Japanese colony in Brazil. Those who went to the Valle del Cauca region made work contracts, without any interference from the emigration company. These contracts ended in 1935 when the commitment of the twenty Japanese families was fulfilled in the agricultural colony. The last people to leave detention centers were Japanese. On September 6, 1945, four days after General MacArthur accepted the formal declaration of Japan's defeat, they were released. For the Japanese residents of Colombia, the war did not mean anything other than suffering, separation of families, economic difficulties, the closing of the credit and banking transactions, the freezing of their assets and the inclusion of their names in the so-called blacklist, meaning losses of what they had achieved with effort and sacrifice in their work. In some places, people refused to shop at Japanese-owned businesses, and on the streets, they were met with offensive language. In conclusion, it was a hard time that made them realize that they were a vulnerable ethnic minority, they were seen as strange and undesirable, and that they were exposed to mistreatment by the government and the Colombian people at any time. Their reaction, especially in the Valle del Cauca region, was one of union and mutual aid. They began to create associations in which they felt comfortable, safe and united, and remembered their own cultural roots, worthy of pride. = Post-World War II = In 1960, following the Second World War, 17 Japanese men were hired for the banana zone of Tumaco, but the project was unsuccessful. When the project failed, 14 of them stayed in Colombia. They established ties of work and family union with the former farmers of Corinto, who by then had dispersed in some areas of the Valle del Cauca, thus expanding the number of Japanese farmers in southern Colombia. Other activities such as the cultivation of vegetables, the sale of ice scrapes, administration of grocery stores and bars owned with billiard games completed the activities that assured them an income. The job of a barber, which was quite popular among the Japanese who lived in Panama, had the advantage of being able to learn and work as an assistant with another Japanese to gain experience. It did not require much initial capital and one could work in a company or independently. Simple equipment and furniture were enough. What the trade did require were cleanliness and manual dexterity. The Japanese barbers in Barranquilla acquired a reputation for being clean, careful and gentle. Their fame earned them the nickname of silk hands. While immigrants on the North Coast excelled in the barbershop trade, those who migrated to the interior of the country excelled in gardening and agriculture.  Returning to Japan  At first, those of Japanese descent living in South America who went back to Japan in search of work, did so through intermediaries. In 1991, in Colombia, a subcontractor who was taking a tour through South American cities looking for working of Japanese descent, made the initial contact through Colombian-Japanese associations in Cali and Barranquilla. In their first year of recruitment, 40 people signed up to work in Japan, with a larger number of men than women. Initially, these workers traveled alone, and then eventually brought their families that had been left in Colombia, to Japan. For migrants who did not know the Japanese language or customs, contact with contractor firms was advantageous. Through them, they got loans to finance the trip, they received help in processing their official papers with immigration, they found employment easily and lodging near work. After the initial years of adjusting to the work, and thanks to having already established their own contacts and expanded their personal and work relationships, the Japanese-Colombian immigrants who traveled back to Japan, also known as Nikkei, have become more independent. They did not need to resort to contractor firms to get a new job; rather, they used their family and friend collections. Nikkei workers continue to play an important role in Japanese society as they help in areas of work where labor is scarce; the privileged visa that has been granted to them allows them to be employed in any type of work. Most Japanese descendants are working in the manufacturing and construction industry or in fish processing. They usually work for a limited time contract and receive their salary according to the hours worked. Some of the Colombian Nikkei, who started like the rest of their colleagues, in hard and heavy jobs of the factories, enjoy positions that are consistent with their professional training. Although more than a decade has passed since the immigration law reform, and the resulting influx of Nikkei workers rose, the basic concerns of immigrants have not changed. They continue to concern the education of children, the lack of social security that would insure them in case of illness or accident, and their inability to earn a pension in the future when they stop working. = Colombian Nikkei in Japanese society = In terms of education, perhaps the most serious problem arises when children do not have enough knowledge of the Japanese language and their parents can not help them with homework, due to their own ability to communicate in Japanese. As a result of this, many Japanese Colombians drop out during elementary school. Many children of immigrants do not receive adequate education in Japan or in the country of origin, with few completing higher education studies. The lack of social security and retirement is a problem for the aging population of Colombian Nikkei. This is partly due to companies trying to avoid the obligatory payment for their employees, offering them short-term or hourly contracts. Immigrants themselves, who feel uncertain about when they will return to their country, do not want to contribute with the social security quota. To date, an association has been formed for the Nikkei of Brazil and Peru. Colombian Nikkei, which are relatively few, live in areas quite separated from each other, which makes it very difficult to meet. All these communities live very busy lives, given their line of work. Thus, socializing with strangers, even when they come from the same country, is a luxury they can not always afford. Social life outside the family circle is shared with other immigrants of Japanese origin who live nearby or work in the same place. In several places, one can find shops and restaurants for meals from Brazil and Peru, something that until now is becoming popular, thanks to the sudden rise of Japanese culture in the world.  Japanese-Colombian demographic  Since the revision of the immigration law in 1989, the flow of people from Latin American countries increased very rapidly in a short time. While in 1984 the population of Latin Americans living in Japan reached only 4,260 people, in 1990 it increased to 72,673 and in 1995 it had tripled to 223,812. In 1984 were 232 Colombians, but increased by 425 by 1990 and in 1995 the number reached 1,367 people. These figures do not discriminate against the Nikkei population of those who do not have Japanese ancestry. It is estimated that the Nikolai Latin American population is at 240,000 people living in Japan. In the case of Colombia, the number is approximately 300 people. It is estimated that the Colombian Nikkei has an estimated population of 1,700 inhabitants.  Culture  = Film = There are films that portray the romantic aspect of Japanese immigration in Colombia, such as the film El Sue√±o del Para√≠so, shot in 2006 and shown in 2007, where the director Carlos Palau recreated the history of that community and his approach to the country through a novel \\"Mar√≠a\\" written by Jorge Isaacs. It portrays the difficult transition, which takes place during the period of the war in the Pacific, after which Colombia, as an allied government of the United States, decided to separate Italian, German, and Japanese people from society, apart from making them outcasts. = Karate = In 1971, with the arrival of Shihan Hiroshi Taninokuchi to Colombia, the Colombian Association of Karate (ASCOK) was founded with the introduction of the Shotokan style. The objective was to organize and promote the practice of Karate-Do at a national level and to gather participants from all over the country.

He also noted a small building, having the appearance of an ancient church, and a square tower.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 2, pp. 113-114; 316 In 1863 Gu√©rin noted: \\"Thirty of the houses only are standing. On the highest point of the plateau on which they are placed is a little fort or Burj, the lower courses of which, if they are not ancient, are at least built of ancient stones.

This plain is open arable land, extending to the brink of the precipitous cliffs on the north. The village has caves beneath, at the foot of the knoll [...] and there are olives on the west, north, and south. There is a central high house like a tower in the village.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 9 They further noted: \\"There is a large cave beneath the village on the east, about 20 to 30 paces square, with a passage on the left at the back, extending 15 paces.

History Since Bolivia has no coast, the first Japanese settlers came from neighboring Peru where their contracts ended prior to the 1950s. Most Japanese settlers had origins from Okinawa, while the rest from Gifu, Hiroshima, Kanagawa and Osaka prefectures. Some of the settlers left Peru for Bolivia after epidemics of disease hit the settlers in Peru. In 1899, Mapiri River Region in La Paz experienced the first entrance of 91 Japanese workers assigned for rubber plantations. Since then, Andes Mountains continued to attract few more hundreds of Japanese laborers, who luckily caught work in mining and railroad construction. The inland Amazon River region appeared as the second main destination for the workers, who also came through Peru to work on rubber plantations in northwestern Bolivia. The end of World War I and Great Depression shifted Japanese workers in the rubber and mining industries respectively. The only places in Bolivia that survived changes were the town of Riberalta and La Paz, which served as the Japanese commercial activities. In the 1930s, most Japanese remained as settlers and many brought wives from their home country while most married local women; these made difference that divided the community. When World War II began, only 29 Japanese Bolivians were deported to the United States. But because more than that, the war had not much effect on the lives of residents of Japanese descent in Bolivia, since the local government did not make anti- Japanese measures. Since the end of the war, the government warmly permitted Japanese refugees. Treaties after 1954 guided in a new chapter of Japanese Bolivian history and the massive influx of agricultural settlers from U.S.-controlled Okinawa and mainland Japan. The need of relocating surplus populations from war-torn Japan met the Bolivian government's wish to develop the eastern lower lands in Santa Cruz Department. With the financial help of the Japanese government, Colonia Okinawa and Colonia San Juan de Yapacan√≠ were established; the two settlements formed the distinctive communities with separate identities‚Äîone Okinawan and the other mainland Japanese‚Äîthat are also currently in transition from the immigrant to the Bolivian-born generation. While Colonia Okinawa grows soy and wheat, San Juan de Yapacan√≠ has specialized in rice and egg production. Nowadays, many descendants have moved to the nearby city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. Language First-generation Japanese settlers generally use Japanese in their daily discourse, and cannot speak Spanish fluently. Subsequent generations had a decreased fluency in the Japanese language, which was attributed to the absence of Japanese-language schools in communes, and speak Spanish more fluently than the first-generation settlers.Kikumura-Yano (2002), p. 103 Many first-generation settlers in Colonia Okinawa are still able to speak Okinawan. Religion A study done by an Christopher Reichl and Thompson in the 1960s among the Japanese settlers at San Juan de Yapacan√≠ noted that 32% of the Japanese were Buddhist, with an equal number who were Roman Catholics. A minority identified themselves as members of Soka Gakkai or Shinto. The majority of the Japanese Catholics converted to the faith after reaching Bolivia. Conversion to Catholicism among the Japanese community increased during the 20th century, which Thompson noted was due to the absence of strong Shinto or Buddhist religious institutions which the settlers could emphasise their faith. Among the non-Christian Japanese, some first and second-generation settlers maintained household Shinto shrines, although the sizeable majority became agnostic in religious outlook.Masterson/Funada-Classen (2004), p. 195-6 Education The Curso Suplementario del Idioma Japones is a supplementary Japanese education program in La Paz.\\"‰∏≠ÂçóÁ±≥„ÅÆË£úÁøíÊéàÊ•≠Ê†°‰∏ÄË¶ßÔºàÂπ≥Êàê25Âπ¥4Êúà15Êó•ÁèæÂú®Ôºâ \\" (Archive).

His father Giovanni ran the local Judo Club Star Napoli, where his elder brother Pino and sister Laura were already vigorously training at the time he was born. Therefore, it is hardly surprising that as soon as the young Marco could walk he was immediately thrust into the judo-arena. However, unlike his much more accomplished bro, it took Marco only a few years to start showing excellent results: already in 2002, while still a teenager, aged just 17, he became absolute champion of Republica Italiana in the under-73 category, an unprecedented record, and probably to remain such for the rest of the century! In the following year Marco became European Junior vice-champion, and in 2004 and 2005 he won back- to-back European under-23 championships.

In episode I'll Be Judge, I'll Be Jury, it was revealed that his real name is Jack Napier and had been previously prosecuted by assistant district attorney Angus Stanton. In Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover Clark Kent of Earth 96 mentions that the Joker of their universe flooded the offices of the Daily Planet with toxin which killed staff members including Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and Perry White.

Batman (1989) Jack Nicholson played the Joker in Tim Burton's 1989 film Batman. The Newsweek review of the film stated that the best scenes are due to the surreal black comedy portrayed in the Joker. In 2003, American Film Institute ranked Nicholson's performance #45 on their list of 50 greatest film villains. Hugo BlickReynolds, Sean (November 18, 2014). \\"Are Bruce Wayne's parents the most killed characters in movie history?\\". Digital Spy. Retrieved October 14, 2015. and David U. Hodges play younger versions of the character in flashbacks in Batman and Batman Forever, respectively. In the film, Jack Napier is the right-hand man of mob boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance) prior to his transformation into the Joker. During a confrontation with the vigilante Batman (Michael Keaton) in a chemical factory, Napier's face is wounded by a ricocheting bullet and he falls into a vat of chemical waste, turning his skin white, his hair green and his lips red. A botched attempt at plastic surgery leaves him with a permanent rictus grin. Driven insane by his reflection, the Joker kills Grissom and takes over his syndicate, launching a crime wave designed to \\"outdo\\" Batman, who he thinks is getting too much press. The Joker describes himself as \\"the world's first fully functional homicidal artist\\" who makes avant-garde \\"art\\" by killing people with cosmetics laced with Smylex, which leaves its victims with a grotesque grin similar to his own. Bruce Wayne later recognizes the Joker as the mugger who murdered his parents years before, leading him down the path of becoming a crime-fighter. The Joker nearly massacres Gotham City's bicentennial celebration and kidnaps reporter Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) to draw Batman out to a climactic battle atop a Gothic cathedral. After telling Batman that they \\"made each other\\", the Joker attempts to escape via helicopter, but Batman ties a grappling hook around his leg and attaches it to a stone gargoyle, causing the Joker to fall to his death when the statue breaks loose of its moorings. Nicholson was to reprise his role in Batman Unchained, the fifth film planned for the series. The Joker was to return as a hallucination in Batman's mind caused by the Scarecrow's fear toxin, and Harley Quinn was to appear as his daughter trying to get revenge on Batman for his death. Due to the critical and commercial failure of Batman & Robin, however, this film was cancelled. The Dark Knight (2008) Heath Ledger played The Joker in Christopher Nolan's 2008 film The Dark Knight. Ledger's interpretation of the character ‚Äì that of a \\"psychopathic, mass-murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy\\" ‚Äì was specifically influenced by the graphic novels Batman: The Killing Joke and Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth. In the film, he wears the character's traditional color palette, while his facial appearance includes smeared clown makeup that covers facial scars of a Glasgow smile. This version of the Joker embodies themes of chaos, anarchy, and obsession; he expresses a desire to upset social order through crime and defines himself by his conflict with Batman (Christian Bale). The character explores techniques found in Ledger's previous performances, including his clown act in Terry Gilliam's fantasy film The Brothers Grimm. It also references paintings by artist Francis Bacon, Anthony Burgess' novel A Clockwork Orange, and various punk rock musicians. In the film, the Joker is hired by Gotham City's mob bosses to kill Batman and announces that he will kill people every day until Batman takes off his mask in public and surrenders himself to police. During his reign of terror, he kills several people in Gotham, including Bruce Wayne's childhood sweetheart Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and scars Gotham District Attorney Harvey Dent's (Aaron Eckhart) face, transforming him into the insane vigilante Two-Face. Batman ultimately defeats him, but the Joker gloats that he has won \\"the battle for Gotham's soul\\" by corrupting Dent, and tells Batman that \\"you and I are destined to do this forever\\" as he is taken to Arkham Asylum. The Joker is considered to be Ledger's finest performance; he himself regarded it as his most enjoyable. When the film was released in July 2008, six months after the actor had died from an accidental prescription drug overdose, the performance caused a sensation and received universal acclaim; Ledger was posthumously awarded the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. DC Extended Universe (2013‚Äìpresent) Jared Leto portrays the Joker in the DC Extended Universe. Originally set to appear in Zack Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the character was ultimately cut and only referenced in the film. Jared Leto debuts as the Joker in David Ayer's 2016 film Suicide Squad. In the film, the Joker manipulates psychiatrist Dr. Harleen Quinzel (Margot Robbie) into falling in love with him during his time as her patient at Arkham Asylum. He eventually manages to convince her to free him, and he electrocutes her before taking her to the Ace Chemicals plant. She then voluntarily falls into the solution that created her lover, bleaching her skin and completing her transformation into Harley Quinn. At some point, the Joker kills his archenemy Batman's (Ben Affleck) partner, Robin, with Harley's help. She is ultimately apprehended and forced into joining Amanda Waller's (Viola Davis) government task force composed of captured supervillains. The Joker tortures one of Waller's security officers for the location of the facility where the nano explosives used as leverage over the criminals are manufactured and threatens an A.R.G.U.S. scientist there to disable the bomb implanted in Harley's neck. After commandeering a military helicopter, the Joker and his men rescue Harley during the task force's mission in Midway City. The chopper is shot down, however, and Harley falls out while the Joker seemingly perishes in the explosion, prompting her to rejoin the task force. After the \\"Suicide Squad\\" defeat the Enchantress (Cara Delavigne), the Joker, who survived the crash, breaks into Belle Reve Prison with his gang to free Harley from her cell, and the pair reunite as the movie ends. Mark Hamill, the voice of the Joker in various DC projects, said that he \\"loved\\" Leto's take on the character. Although many scenes featuring the Joker were omitted from the theatrical release, some of this unused footage did make it into the extended cut. Leto also appeared as the Joker in the music video \\"Purple Lamborghini\\", by Skrillex and Rick Ross, from the film's soundtrack. Despite not making an official appearance, the Joker's existence plays a pivotal part in the film Birds of Prey as a sizable amount of the plot involves Harley trying to cope without being his girlfriend and partner-in-crime. As a result, she is frequently taunted by the citizens and villains of Gotham City about not truly being done with him. When Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor) learns that Harley abandoned the Joker, he decides to kill her knowing that the Joker will not retaliate against him. The Joker appears in animated form in the film's prologue which details Harley's life and separation from him while a scene of Jared Leto from Suicide Squad is used in a flashback sequence. In addition, an uncredited Johnny Goth portrayed the character from the back in a similar flashback scene in which Harley and Joker tattoo a man's face. This was done in this way since as the director felt that the film didn‚Äôt need Leto to return for the character to still have a presence.https://screenrant.com/birds-prey-movie-joker-not-jared-leto-reason/ Joker (2019) In 2016, Todd Phillips began working on a standalone Joker film, with intent for it to launch a line of films unconnected to the DCEU called DC Black. Development of the film was confirmed in August 2017; Phillips was attached to direct and co-write with Scott Silver, while Martin Scorsese was set to produce. The film, Joker, was released in October 2019. In Joker, Joaquin Phoenix portrays Arthur Fleck, a party clown and aspiring stand-up comedian who suffers from a mental illness that causes pathological laughter. He lives with his abusive mother Penny (Frances Conroy) in Gotham City in 1981 and idolizes talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). After losing his job for dropping a gun in a children‚Äôs hospital, Arthur kills three Wayne Enterprises employees on a train in self defence, starting a city- wide protest. He slowly loses his sanity, killing his mother and the colleague (Glenn Fleshler) who previously gave him the gun. After being called to appear on Franklin‚Äôs show after being mocked on it, Arthur goes on a rant about society abandoning him and kills Franklin on live television. He is arrested, but is rescued by protesters in clown masks, and is celebrated by the protesters as a hero. His actions inspire a protestor to kill Bruce Wayne‚Äôs parents, making him indirectly responsible for Batman‚Äôs existence. Phoenix was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, making him the second actor to receive an Academy Award for playing the character, following Heath Ledger.

Retrieved October 19, 2015. The Joker returned in the follow-up series The New Batman Adventures (1997‚Äì1999) with a stylistic redesign. His white skin now had a bluish-grey tinge, while his eyes had their sclerae removed, and were replaced by cavernous black spaces with white pupils. His trademark red lips were omitted, focusing more attention on his teeth, and his green hair was darkened. His suit's colors were also changed from purple and orange to purple and green. In the Superman: The Animated Series (1996‚Äì2000) crossover episode \\"World's Finest\\", the Joker travels to Metropolis and makes a deal with Lex Luthor to kill Superman, forcing Batman who was on his tail, to team up with the latter and stop the former two.

In \\"A Better World\\", a lobotomized Joker is briefly seen in an alternate universe ruled by the Justice Lords. The Joker was later featured in the Static Shock (2000‚Äì2004) episode \\"The Big Leagues\\", in which he starts a crime spree with a new gang of metahumans only to be stopped by Static, Batman and Robin. The Joker made his final chronological appearance in the direct-to-video feature film Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (2000), in which he mysteriously returns to Gotham City 40 years in the future. Flashbacks reveal that before he died, the Joker kidnapped and tortured Robin (Tim Drake), turning him into an insane, miniature version of himself dubbed 'Joker Junior', learning Batman's secret identity in the process. The Joker's death was edited and redubbed amid controversy surrounding the Columbine High School massacre; the original version sees Tim (Joker Junior) shoot the Joker in the heart, whereas the edited version simply sees him push the Joker into damaged cables to be electrocuted out of sight. However, a microchip implanted in Drake's neck was revealed to have possessed a copy of the Joker's consciousness and DNA, allowing him to take over his host until he is defeated by the new Batman, Terry McGinnis (voiced by Will Friedle), who destroys the microchip and the Joker alongside it once and for all.

While most of his appearances in animation depict the Joker with a purple tuxedo, this version of the character wears a purple suit. He is also depicted with a partially-shaved head and a strong dislike of raisins; the latter of which is a running gag throughout the series. Joker is also a member of the Legion of Doom, who constantly bullies the lesser members until Harley points out they are more powerful than him and nobody has to listen to him. In the first episode, he abandons Harley Quinn and leaves her to be sent to Arkham Asylum, making no efforts to rescue her for over a year. After eventually breaking out with Poison Ivy's help, Harley returns to the Joker despite the former's insistence that he does not care about her. To prove this, Ivy has the Riddler kidnap both Harley and Batman and place them in a death trap, forcing the Joker to choose who he will rescue. After the Joker chooses Batman, Harley finally realizes that Ivy was right about him, and breaks up with him, deciding to become an independent criminal and dethrone him as Gotham's greatest criminal. Throughout the rest of the season, Joker makes several attempts to get back at Harley, culminating in taking over Gotham, killing Ivy, and capturing Harley's crew and Batman. In the season finale, \\"The Final Joke\\", Joker captures Harley herself and admits that he still loves her, so he tries to throw her in acid that will render her \\"normal\\" and eliminate any feelings Joker still has for her. However, a resurrected Ivy saves Harley at the last minute and drops Joker in the acid, though not before he destroys all of Gotham. Despite physically surviving, the acid renders him sane and causes his skin to return to normal. In the episode \\"All the Best Inmates Have Daddy Issues\\", Harley and Ivy find him months later working at a bar with no memory of his past self, though he shows signs of relapsing, as he laughs maniacally at a funny picture of his new girlfriend's kids. In \\"Dye Hard\\", Joker is employed at a luxury bar at Wayne Tower and encounters Harley again, who tries to avoid him, but they end up handcuffed together during a hostage situation organized by Doctor Psycho and the Riddler so they can steal a mind control helmet and enslave an army of Parademons Harley previously brought to Gotham. After Joker and Harley escape, she concludes that only the Justice League, who had been previously trapped inside a book by the Queen of Fables on Joker's orders, can stop them. Joker then mentions having several dreams about his past life, including the book, but he struggles to remember where it is. To jog his memory, Harley reluctantly brings him to Ace Chemicals and tosses him into a vat of acid to turn him back into the Joker. In \\"A Fight Worth Fighting For\\", Joker remembers entering a relationship with a nurse named Bethany, who found him and nursed him back to health six months prior. Under threat of an explosive device Harley put in his head, Joker takes her to Bethany's house to get the book back, but Bethany throws it away after he enrages her, and the book gets grabbed by a Parademon. While retrieving the book, Joker reflects on his relationship with Bethany and realizes he found true love. He later reconciles with her and chooses to maintain both his criminal lifestyle and relationship with Bethany. =Film= Troy Baker voiced the Joker in Batman: Assault on Arkham, reprising his role from the video game Batman: Arkham Origins. * The Jester, a heroic version of the Joker from a parallel earth, appears in Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths (2010), voiced by James Patrick Stuart.

After Harley betrays the Pact to escape with the virus, John helps Bruce search for her at a defunct carnival and murders several Agency operatives. Bruce confronts John and either retains his trust or shatters their friendship. The former choice results in John helping Bruce to apprehend Harley, while the latter decision leads to John saving Harley and vowing to become Batman's mortal enemy. Adopting the identity of the \\"Joker,\\" John either becomes a ruthless vigilante set on bringing Waller to \\"justice\\" by any means necessary, or transforms into a psychopathic criminal intent on psychologically torturing Bruce. Regardless of the choices the player makes, Batman ultimately defeats Joker and sends him back to Arkham Asylum.

He can play either as a striker or as an attacking midfielder. Early life Kuduzoviƒá left Bosnia in 1992 and moved to the United Kingdom where he settled in Leicester. Club career Within a year of emigrating to Britain, Kuduzoviƒá was spotted by Leicester City at a tournament. He played for the Foxes for a year before being picked up by Derby County. Kuduzoviƒá would go on to spend eight years in the Derby academy, earning a full-time contract before he had even left school. However, in his final three years at the club, he only played for the reserve team football, with his failure to make a breakthrough to the first team leading to his exit in 2004. Almost immediately he signed for Notts County and made his first-team debut within days. However, halfway through the season, Gary Mills, who had signed Kuduzoviƒá, was sacked, and the Bosnian was unable to find favour under new player-manager Ian Richardson. At the end of the season, Kuduzoviƒá admitted that he \\"wanted to get away\\" and on 25 January 2005 he completed a move to Irish club Sligo Rovers, then managed by Sean Connor in the League of Ireland First Division. In his first season at the Showgrounds, Kuduzoviƒá helped the club to the league title which saw them win promotion back to the top flight for the first time in six years. The striker continued to impress in his performances in the Premier Division as Sligo achieved a credible fifth-placed finish in their first year back in the Irish top flight. Twelve months later, he finished as the Bit O' Red's top scorer with ten league goals as they ended the season in sixth. However, midway through the 2008 campaign, he left to join reigning champions Drogheda United for an undisclosed fee. It was a spell that started very brightly as, 15 days later, he scored the winning goal against Levadia Tallinn in the home leg of their UEFA Champions League first qualifying round tie.Drogheda United 2‚Äì1 Levadia Tallinn ‚Äì RT√â Sport . Rte.ie (6 August 2008). In the second round, the Boynesiders went within the width of a post of knocking Ukrainian giants Dynamo Kiev out. However, a disappointing second half to the season saw them enter examinership due to financial troubles, with a ten-point deduction leaving them in eighth place in the final table. Kuduzoviƒá, who scored three goals in his time at United Park, was the subject of interest from Connor once more when the Belfast-born boss tried to persuade the striker to join Dundalk at the beginning of last year. However, on 27 January 2009, Kuduzoviƒá followed former Drogheda manager Paul Doolin to Cork CityFaz Signs for City! ‚Äì CorkCityFC.ie and he finished as the club's top scorer with nine goals as they ended the season in third ‚Äì their highest league position since winning the title in 2005.

The following weekend, on his first ever outing at Oriel Park, in his first Louth Derby, Faz scored a late equaliser against Drogheda as Dundalk came from 2‚Äì0 down to snatch an unlikely draw. In July, Kuduzoviƒá became the first Dundalk player to score on the European stage in almost 19 years when he netted against Grevenmacher in Stade Josy Barthel, Luxembourg. He struck again in the second leg at Oriel Park a week later to write his name into the history books as the first ever foreign player to score in both legs of a European tie for the club, as 2010 saw them compete in their 44th European game as they eventually bowed out to Levski Sofia in the UEFA Europa League second qualifying round. On 1 October 2010, Kuduzoviƒá scored his first career hat-trick with three second-half goals in a 3‚Äì0 win against Galway United at Oriel Park. He ended the season with 16 goals in all competitions, his highest ever return in a single season, to become Dundalk's most prolific scorer in the Premier Division since Peter Hanrahan in 1991.

From 1994 to 1997 a professional fourth-level Russian Third League existed. Its teams moved back to amateur competition in 1998. For more details, see 1994 Russian Third League, 1995 Russian Third League, 1996 Russian Third League, 1997 Russian Third League. Current name: Russian Amateur Football Championship (LFK).

In dimension 4, it forms a piece of Seiberg‚ÄìWitten theory and other aspects of gauge theory. It is named after noted mathematicians Andr√© Lichnerowicz who proved it in 1963, and Roland Weitzenb√∂ck. The formula gives a relationship between the Dirac operator and the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator acting on spinors, in which the scalar curvature appears in a natural way. The result is significant because it provides an interface between results from the study of elliptic partial differential equations, results concerning the scalar curvature, and results on spinors and spin structures. Given a spin structure on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold M and a spinor bundle S, the Lichnerowicz formula states that on a section œà of S, :D^2\\\\psi = abla^* abla\\\\psi + \\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\operatorname{Sc}\\\\psi where Sc denotes the scalar curvature and abla^* abla is the connection Laplacian. More generally, given a complex spin structure on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold M, a spinor bundle W¬± with section \\\\phi, and a connection A on its determinant line bundle L, the Lichnerowicz formula is :D_{A}^{*}D_{A}\\\\phi= abla _A^{*} abla_{A}\\\\phi+\\\\frac{1}{4}R\\\\phi+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\langle F_{A}^{+},\\\\phi\\\\rangle. Here, D_A is the Dirac operator D_A:\\\\Gamma (W^+)\\\\to \\\\Gamma (W^-), and abla _A is the covariant derivative associated with the connection A, abla _A: \\\\Gamma (W^+)\\\\to \\\\Gamma(W^+\\\\otimes T_M^*). R is the usual scalar curvature (a contraction of the Ricci tensor) and F_A^+ is the self-dual part of the curvature of A.

A print of the film survives in the George Eastman House Motion Picture Collection. Plot The film follows the story of Midge O'Hara, a young woman living in the country, who leaves her home in order to perform on Broadway. She is able to get hired as a chorus girl, and, at her new job, meets Cherry Blow, a party girl and gold digger. Cherry dates one man, staying with him until his cash runs out, upon which she leaves for someone else wealthy. One of these men is Jack Chalvey, whom Cherry had dated until his expenses from buying her so many things left him in debt. After meeting Midge, Jack, who has become depressed and almost commits suicide, reforms his life and also begins to have interest in her. However, Midge's own life becomes more complicated when her boyfriend from the country, Elmer Watkins, comes to propose to her. To make matters worse, the rich Henry Rockwell begins chasing after her.Broadway Love at lonchaney.org Cast * Dorothy Phillips as Midge O'Hara * Juanita Hansen as Cherry Blow * William Stowell as Henry Rockwell * Harry von Meter as Jack Chalvey * Lon Chaney as Elmer Watkins * Gladys Tennyson as Mrs. Watkins * Eve Southern as Drina Reception Like many American films of the time, Broadway Love was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards.

Singles from the album were Duur, Anjane, and Aankhain. The album was a result of the band's comeback into the Pakistani pop scene after a hiatus of eight years. Originally a quartet, the band decided to continue with only two of its former members. The album was poetically named ‚Äòduur‚Äô meaning ‚Äòfar‚Äô in Urdu to depict their journey restarted, towards a goal that they see from afar. Background Strings began as a quartet led by Faisal Kapadia and Bilal Maqsood, accompanied by Rafiq Wazir Ali and Kareem Bashir Bhoy. The four disbanded in 1992 to continue their studies. While Kapadia went to Houston, Texas to continue business studies, Maqsood joined an art school and later joined an advertising agency as an art director. Upon his return from the USA, Kapadia joined Maqsood at the firm he was working at. Maqsood had sold his guitar and thoughts of getting into music occasionally crossed his mind. It was when Maqsood composed a tune for a song humming the word duur with it that Kapadia realised they should reform the band. Both had married, both had jobs. Kapadia even had a family business. Leaving all to satisfy their passion for music was hard. Upon consultation amongst themselves and friends from the music industry, especially Rohail Hyatt of the band Vital Signs, the two re-formed the band. They tried to approach Rafiq and Kareem but they declined as they had settled well in their new lives. Thus the band was reincarnated and Maqsood asked his good friend Jamshed Mehmood to direct a video for their first song, Duur. By mid-2000, the song hit the airwaves and became an instant hit with fans. Track listing All songs are written by Anwar Maqsood except those mentioned below. All songs are composed by Bilal Maqsood.

Flora left The flora consists of an estimated 13,000 native species including trees, shrubs, herbs and epiphytic species as well as orchids. There are approximately 20,000 species; this includes the native and exotic and 280 native endangered species. The most valuable tree species in the native forests are: lapacho, perob√°, yvyrapyt√°, Bay Cedar, incense. The tree that is emblematic of Paraguay is the lapacho. The forest zone is a major natural resource.

Fast of the Firstborn When the Eve of Passover falls on Shabbat, the Fast of the Firstborn customarily takes place on the preceding Thursday, instead of the day before (Friday). This is because it is forbidden to fast on Shabbat (except when it coincides with Yom Kippur), and it is preferable not to fast on Friday. There is some debate over whether a siyum on such a Thursday would be enough to remove the requirement of fasting, or if it would only move the requirement to fast to Friday. Search for chametz Normally, the search for Chametz (leavened bread) occurs on the night of the 14th of Nisan, which is one night before the start of Passover. When this night is a Friday, the search for chametz takes place one night earlier (on the 13th), since use of a candle and the act of burning chametz are forbidden on Shabbat. The chametz is then burned on Friday morning. It is normally forbidden to eat before conducting the search for chametz, which is carried out by the firstborn. This firstborn may be fatigued or uncomfortable due to having just observed the Fast of the Firstborn. According to the Mateh Moshe and Maharil, a firstborn who is fatigued or uncomfortable from the fast may eat some food before the search, or another person may be appointed to perform the search on behalf of the firstborn. Observing Seudah Shlishit Seudah Shlishit is the third meal of Shabbat, usually eaten on Shabbat afternoon. Traditionally, two loaves of bread (challah) are served with the three Shabbat meals, including Seudah Shlishit. However, when the Eve of Passover falls on Shabbat, the restriction on consuming such chametz begins on Saturday morning (usually sometime between 9:30 and 10:00 a.m.); to include bread with each of the meals, all three must be consumed before the restriction comes into effect. Although most chametz has been removed from the household before the search for chametz, enough bread is kept to eat at these three meals. (While matzah can ordinarily be used to fulfill the obligation of Seduah Shlishit on Shabbat, it is not used for any of the three meals on the Eve of Passover, since it is forbidden to consume matzah on that day.) The bread is stored in a location where it does not come into contact with Passover food or dishes. The first of the three meals is consumed on Friday evening, as usual. On Saturday morning, morning services at synagogue are held earlier than usual. Following services, a second meal is held and finished quickly. After a pause, a third meal is begun, in which the remainder of the chametz is consumed. Any chametz that remains following the completion of three meals is disposed of. If chametz is found after Passover begins, it is customary to bag it and place it outdoors until it can be disposed of in proper waste receptacles following the third day of Passover. (It is not disposed of immediately because of the restriction of working or carrying money on the first and last two days of Passover, similar to the restrictions on laborious activities on Shabbat.) In very rare situations, when another person is in dire need, this chametz be given away instead of thrown out. It is advised that each community assess the overlooked chametz, and, if the amount is substantial, donate double in fresh chametz (bread and bread products) directly to those in need, through organizations that feed those in need, immediately following the second day of the Passover. The actual extra chametz would likely become too stale for human consumption by the time it could reach those in need, so it is considered a mitzvah (good deed) to leave this extra chametz in public areas as food for birds and squirrels. Some national laws do not allow this because it may attract dangerous or unwanted wildlife, so instead the extra chametz should simply be thrown out in outdoor waste receptacles. This practice is decided by the rabbis in each community. Individuals generally consult with a local rabbi in the event of finding any substantial chametz during Passover. Frequency While the coincidence of the Eve of Passover and Shabbat can occur as often as three times in a decade, it is also possible for as many as 20 years to pass between two instances. The percentage of the Eve of Passover on Shabbat occurring is 11.5%. During the 20th century, the Eve of Passover fell on Shabbat 12 times: in 1903, 1910, 1923, 1927, 1930, 1947, 1950, 1954, 1974, 1977, 1981, and 1994. In the 21st century, it has occurred three times: in 2001, 2005, and 2008. Future occurrences in the 21st century include 2021, 2025, 2045, 2048, 2052, 2072, 2075, 2079, and 2099.  Other holidays  = Other Jewish holidays in the same year = For years in which the Eve of Passover falls on Shabbat, some other Jewish holidays are also observed irregularly. Purim, which comes earlier in the year, occurs on Friday (beginning Thursday night, and making Purim a three‚Äìday holiday in Jerusalem), the spring holiday of Shavuot occurs on Monday and Tuesday (beginning Sunday night), the fall holidays of Rosh Hashanah, Sukkot, and Shemini Atzeret- Simchat Torah all occur on Tuesday and Wednesday (beginning Monday night), and Yom Kippur occurs on Thursday (beginning Wednesday night). = Other Jewish holiday alteration = In years when the Eve of Passover is on Friday and the first day of Passover is on Shabbat, which happens more commonly than the Eve of Passover falling on Shabbat itself, the 17th day of Tammuz and the ninth day of Av will fall on a Saturday; since fasts other than Yom Kippur are not observed on Shabbat, the fasts of the Seventeenth of Tammuz and Tisha B'Av will be postponed to the next day (the eighteenth of Tammuz and the tenth of Av, respectively).

The Bretons were victorious, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Angers in September 851 which secured Breton independence. Background In 845, Nomino√´, Duke of Brittany, had defeated Charles the Bald at the Battle of Ballon. A truce had followed, but in 849 Nomino√´ resumed his offensive against the Franks. He sought to establish full personal control over his duchy and extend its territory. In 851, Frankish garrisons left in the previous year in Rennes and Nantes capitulated to Nomino√´, who raided eastwards, ravaging Le Mans. Nomino√´ then decided to advance to Chartres, but died suddenly, near Vend√¥me. His successor, his son Erispoe, took command of the Breton force and continued its offensive in alliance with Lambert II of Nantes, a renegade Frank dispossessed by Charles the Bald.Smith, Julia M. H. Province and Empire: Brittany and the Carolingians. Cambridge University Press: 1992. Faced with the threat, Charles sought the support of his brother Louis the German, obtaining a contingent of Saxons to increase the size of his force. He marched to confront Erispoe, who retreated back to the borders of Brittany. Both leaders probably led smallish armies, with Charles commanding around 4,000 troops and Erispoe around 1,000. The battle In August, Charles left Maine to enter Brittany by the Roman road from Nantes to Corseul. The king arranged his troops in two lines: at the rear were the Franks; in front were Saxon mercenaries whose role was to break the assault of the Breton cavalry, which was known for its mobility and tenacity.Guy Halsall, Warfare and Society in the Barbarian West, Routledge, 2003. P. 101. In the initial engagement, a javelin assault forced Saxons to retreat behind the more heavily armoured Frankish line. The Franks were taken by surprise. Rather than engage in a mel√©e, the Bretons harassed the heavily armed Franks from a distance, in a manner comparable to Parthian tactics, but with javelins rather than archers. They alternated furious charges, feints, and sudden withdrawals, drawing out the Franks and encircling over-extended groups. After two days of this sort of fighting, Frankish losses in men and horses were mounting to catastrophic levels, while the Bretons suffered few casualties. With his force disintegrating, Charles withdrew from the field during the night. When his disappearance was noticed the following morning, panic seized the Frankish soldiers. The Bretons quickly raided the camp, taking booty and weapons and killing as many fugitives as they could. Treaty of Angers The battle redefined relations between the Franks and Bretons. Charles the Bald agreed to meet Erispoe in Angers, on the outskirts of the now-extended territory of Brittany. =The King in the Empire= In September Erispoe submitted to Charles as Emperor, while receiving the title of king in return. According to the Annals of Saint-Bertin \\"Erispoe, son of Nomino√´ from Charles, in the City of Angers submitted and received a gift of symbols of the monarchy that came from his father, adding also Rennais, Nantais and Retz.\\"Annales de Saint-Bertin quoted in Histoire de la Bretagne, tome 1, Des M√©galithes aux Cath√©drales, collectif, √©ditions Skol Vreizh. By the treaty, Erispoe remained in principle subject to Charles the Bald, but could now also see himself Charles's equal, able to use the title of \\"rex\\". Charles recognized the authority of Breton rulers over the areas around Rennes, Nantes, and Pays de Retz, which had previously formed the Frankish \\"Breton March\\", a border zone. Erispoe, at the same time, absorbed a non-Breton speaking population of Gallo-Roman and Romano-Frankish peoples. =Border demarcation= The Treaty of Angers demarcated the borders of the medieval Duchy of Brittany and the later French province of Brittany. It also marked a turning point in relations between the Western Franks and Brittany. Later Breton dukes were able to extend their territory further, but were unable to hold it for long. The Treaty of Angers essentially defined the limits of historic Brittany. The peace created by the regularisation of Franco-Breton relations also gave the Bretons the stability to fend off later Viking attacks.

Biography Rupprecht Gerngro√ü was born in Shanghai in 1915, to German parents who both originated from Munich. He returned with his family to Germany after the First World War and was educated in Munich. He served as a volunteer in the Wehrmacht during the Second World War, was promoted to officer and was wounded. Recovering in a hospital in Poland, he witnessed the execution of a group of Jewish people, an event which turned his opinion against the Nazis.Interview with Felix Heidenberger (in German) Bayerischer Rundfunk, published: 8 May 2008, accessed: 26 June 2008 Upon his return he was put in charge of an interpreter company in the Bavarian capital.

Wittenstein - Lecture Series accessed: 30 June 2008 From 1942, this company formed the heart of the Freiheitsaktion Bayern, but it also involved a number of civilians. All up, the resistance movement had a strength of about 400 people.Der Mord an Pfarrer Grimm - Die Freiheitsaktion Bayern (in German) accessed: 27 June 2008 J√ºrgen Wittenstein, a friend of the members of the Wei√üe Rose, collected weapons for the movement from wounded soldiers at the Italian front, where he had volunteered to serve in order to escape the Gestapo. During the war, he managed to complete his law degree at the University of Erlangen in 1942. In the final days of the war, when the order was issued to defend Munich to the last man by blowing up all bridges and using the Munich trams to form barricades, he decided to resist this order to prevent a complete destruction of the infrastructure of the city.  Freiheitsaktion Bayern FAB In the final days of the Second World War, Gerngro√ü was serving as a Captain in an interpreter company in Munich. On the morning of 28 April 1945, he ordered the occupation of the radio transmitters in Schwabing-Freimann and Erding and he broadcast messages in multiple languages, encouraging soldiers to resist the Nazi regime. He proclaimed a hunt for the golden pheasants (German:Jagd auf die Goldfasane), this being a popular nickname for NSDAP officials due to the color of their uniforms, and encouraged people to display white flags from their homes as a sign of surrender. His group also occupied the Munich city hall and the headquarters of the V√∂lkischer Beobachter and M√ºnchner Neuesten Nachrichten, two newspapers vital to the Nazi propaganda. The claim that the Freiheitsaktion had taken control over Munich was however premature and led to other uprisings against the Nazis in the region, which were often brutally suppressed by the SS. Gerngro√ü's attempt to stop further bloodshed was quickly crushed by the Nazi and SS units still loyal to the collapsing regime. Paul Giesler, Gauleiter of the Gau Munich-Upper Bavaria was personally involved in putting it down. While Gerngro√ü escaped into the mountains, many others of his movement did not and more than forty were executed hours before the liberation of the city.\\" Kein weiteres sinnloses Blutvergie√üen\\" Versuche, den Krieg abzuk√ºrzen (in German) accessed: 27 June 2008 While unsuccessful in liberating Munich that day, Gerngro√ü did save a number of lives through his action. The prisoners of the Dachau concentration camp were supposed to be sent on a death march south with their SS guards to be used as laborers in the Alpenfestung. His broadcast triggered an uprising in Dachau and the SS left in panic, abandoning the inmates who were liberated by the arriving US forces soon thereafter.Prisoners and Dachau citizens revolting against the SS accessed: 26 June 2008 He is also credited with saving the city of Munich from further destruction, and is therefore considered to be the leader of the only successful putsch against Hitler.\\"The White Rose:\\" Student Resistance in Germany During WWII publisher: Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, author:John Ginder, published: September 2001, accessed: 26 June 2008 His announcement of the end of the Nazis in Munich led many German soldiers to desert the lost cause and the US forces arriving in Munich on 30 April experienced virtually no resistance when taking the city. In G√∂tting (near Bad Aibling) the teacher Hangl and the priest Grimm decided to hoist the Bavarian flag at the steeple (instead of the swastika flag, called by the priest the \\"red hanky\\"; although urged by an officer to remove the flag, they didn't obey. An SS officer later that day arrested both, and they were shot shortly afterwards. On 2 May 1945 the village was liberated by American forces. Franz Ritter von Epp, Reichskommissar of Bavaria, refused his support to the movement, contributing to its failure to succeed completely.Universit√§tsbibliothek Regensburg - Bosls bayrische Biographie - Franz Ritter von Epp (in German), author: Karl Bosl, publisher: Pustet, page 179-180 Gerngro√ü had counted on his support.  After the war  In 1962, Gerngro√ü ordered a Chinese Junk in Hong Kong. He took it across the Indian Ocean, sailing to the Mediterranean Sea, where it supposedly was the only one of its kind traveling the Adriatic Sea. He named the boat Mau Yee (German:M√ºnchner Freiheit). Gerngro√ü sailed through the Adriatic for another twenty years before eventually returning to Munich, dying there in 1996.  Legacy  Gerngro√ü remains almost forgotten within the small German resistance movement. In 1946, the Feilitzschplatz in the Munich suburb of Schwabing was renamed M√ºnchner Freiheit (Munich liberty) to commemorate the courageous attempt to free Munich from the Nazis in the last days of the Second World War.BR-Online - Der Aufstand der \\"Freiheitsaktion Bayern\\" (in German) published: 17 February 2005, accessed: 27 June 2008 While the Freiheitsaktion Bayern was a failure from a military point of view, it did prevent the further destruction of Munich and sped up the collapse of the Nazi regime in the city. The US occupation authorities acknowledged this fact by recognising the FAB and asking the surviving members to support the Counterintelligence Corps - CIC but the group declined.Stunde Null at the Ground Level: Munich Page 122 onwards, Paper on Germany in 1945, accessed: 27 June 2008 Upon her death in 2001, his widow left a substantial amount of documents about the FAB, collected by Gerngro√ü, to the Bavarian state archives.J√ºngste Nachlasserwerbungen des Bayerischen Hauptstaatsarchivs (in German), Munich, December 2001, accessed: 27 June 2008  Assassination attempts on Hitler  On two occasions, Gerngro√ü apparently tried to assassinate Hitler.

Evaluation According to Nazarene historian Stan Ingersol, \\"Winchester was not the only woman to teach religion at Nazarene colleges during her lifetime. ... But Winchester far surpassed them in academic background and achievement, paving the way for other professional female theologians in the church, including Mildred Bangs Wynkoop, who encountered Winchester as a freshman at Northwest Nazarene College.\\"Stan Ingersol, \\"Our Nazarene Foremothers: Woman in a New World: Olive Winchester‚Äôs Life in Theology and Higher Education.\\", New Horizons: Resources for Nazarene Clergywomen (February/March 2002):5. Beliefs Winchester was \\"committed to the \\"hermeneutic of holiness\\"\\",Richard T. Hughes and William B. Adrian, eds., Models for Christian Higher Education: Strategies for Survival and Success in the Twenty-First Century (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1997):354. and has been described as \\"the descriptive-doctrinaire approach\\" to teaching biblical theology.Richard T. Hughes and William B. Adrian, eds., Models for Christian Higher Education: Strategies for Survival and Success in the Twenty-First Century (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1997):360. According to Ingersol, \\"Winchester had earned high marks in biblical criticism at Glasgow but was conservative in her application of this knowledge within the Nazarene context. Her books included studies of Moses, the prophets, and the life of Jesus. Her Crisis Experiences in the Greek New Testament (1953) stood in the linguistic- exegetical tradition pioneered by Daniel Steele, a Methodist scholar at Boston University. > Steele defended the doctrine of entire sanctification by a study of the > Greek aorist, and Winchester appropriated his agenda and attempted to > develop it further, though this approach has since fallen out of favor with > many Wesleyan-holiness biblical scholars.Stan Ingersol, \\"Our Nazarene > Foremothers: Woman in a New World: Olive Winchester‚Äôs Life in Theology and > Higher Education.\\", New Horizons: Resources for Nazarene Clergywomen > (February/March 2002):4-5. However, Nazarene theologian and general superintendent John A. Knight argued in 1995 that Winchester and Steele were part of an \\"earlier generation of holiness-traditions scholars [who] overstated the grammatical evidence for entire sanctification as a 'second definite work of grace.'John A. Knight, All Loves Excelling: Proclaiming Our Wesleyan Message (Kansas City, MO: Beacon Hill Press of Kansas City, 1995). Winchester rejected the increasingly prevalent premillennial perspective. Reflecting the New England tradition of Wesleyan-holiness biblical scholarship shaped by Daniel Steele, she was amillennial and interpreted the Book of Revelation as a coded record of events that had occurred in the New Testament era, perhaps during Nero's reign, not predictions of the future. In 1931, Winchester wrote a series on science and religion in The Young People's Journal, a Nazarene publication for high school youth, where she had a regular column. > In the second essay in the series, Winchester described three scientific > theories on the origins of the universe, identifying her own view as the > \\"planetesimal theory,\\" which held that the observable universe developed as > gravitational forces caused matter to coalesce over long eons of time. > Nazarene theologian A. M. Hills embraced the identical view when he > discussed the Christian doctrine of creation in his 2-vol Fundamental > Christian Theology. While neither believed in biological evolution, > Winchester and Hills embraced cosmic and geological evolution without > compunction.Stan Ingersol, \\"Strange Bedfellows: The Nazarenes and > Fundamentalism\\", Wesleyan Theological Journal (Fall 2005):21-22. Winchester was quoted as saying: \\"When in a mental fog, attend to definitions.\\"Olive Winchester, in A.

IGI is headquartered in Antwerp and has offices in New York City, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Bangkok, Tokyo, Dubai, Tel Aviv, Toronto, Los Angeles, Kolkata, New Delhi, Surat, Chennai, Thrissur, Ahmedabad, Shanghai, and Cavalese. Established in 1975, IGI is the largest independent gemological laboratory worldwide. It also runs Schools of Gemology in several locations around the globe. Operations IGI has a staff of over 650 gemologists, appraisers and professional office personnel. The International Gemological Institute \\"has been at the forefront of technology since its commencement in 1975\\". This characteristic can be seen in the actions that the IGI has taken recently towards creating an Online Data Retrieval program and its Registration and Recovery Service. The IGI is also perfecting methods to reliably distinguish between synthetic and natural diamonds. IGI provides its services to the public through diamond dealers, and jewelry manufactures. IGI provides independent grading reports, colored stone reports, identification and appraisal reports, diamond authentication and attestations of origin, and laser inscription services. They also offers diamond and colored stone courses through IGI's Schools of Gemology. The IGI school was the first to offer the practical Rough Diamond course. Graduates from the IGI school of Gemology are awarded an IGI Diploma. The Toronto location will be closing. Market position IGI is the largest laboratory for certification of diamonds and fine jewelry. IGI has the only international certification lab controlled by one central governing body that adheres to one internationally accepted system for diamond grading. IGI is International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001: 2000 certified in four countries, including the United States, Canada, India and the United Arab Emirates. Recently, IGI became the first gem lab to collaborate with the Tanzanite Foundation to help distribute jewelry certificates using the Tanzanite Quality Scale, developed by the Tanzanite Foundation in collaboration with IGI. An estimated 11 percent of all diamonds purchased by India's consumers come from IGI vendors in Kolkata. Expansion * In March 2007, IGI collaborated with the Tanzanite Foundation to produce a globally acceptable grading scale, called the Tanzanite Quality Scale (TQS), for the popular gem called Tanzanite, which was discovered in Tanzania in the 1960s and is rapidly becoming a globally recognized gem. * In April 2010, IGI marked the opening of their laboratory in Surat, India.

Edward Allworthy Armstrong was born at Corlea, Lowwood, Belfast on 8 October 1900, the younger child and only son of Hamilton Armstrong, manufacturer's agent, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Susan. He was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution and then at Queen's University, Belfast, studying science in his first year then switching to philosophy, obtaining a BA (hons) in 1921. In preparation for ordination in the Anglican Church he then studied theology at Ridley Hall, Cambridge. He later studied anthropology and Chinese at Hong Kong University and obtained an MA in the history and philosophy of religion and in Chinese studies from Leeds University. As a young priest he travelled widely, serving in parishes in Doncaster, Ipswich, Hong Kong, and Leeds before settling in Cambridge in 1943 where he lived for the rest of his life. He married Eunice Joan Uttley in 1940, and had two sons. He died in December 1978. As an ornithologist, he was known for his study of bird behaviour and his intensive study of the wren (Troglodytes troglodytes). He travelled to many islands - including the Shetland Islands, Iceland, and St Kilda - to study the wren. In the 1960s he travelled to East Africa to study and to record 'duetting' in birds. He published a number of ornithological texts including Birds of the Grey Wind (1940), Bird display and behaviour (1942), The Way Birds Live (1943), the New Naturalist monograph The Wren (1955), The folklore of birds: an enquiry into the origin and distribution of some magico-religious traditions (1958), The Study of Bird Song (1963) and The Life and Lore of the Bird (1975). He also published two theological works books related to his work as a priest, The Gospel Parables (1967) and Saint Francis: Nature Mystic (1973), and a book which was initially intended as an assessment of how good a naturalist Shakespeare was, Shakespeare‚Äôs imagination: A study of the psychology of association and inspiration (1946). He eventually demonstrated that Shakespeare was no naturalist at all! He was awarded the Burroughs Medal in the United States in 1942 for his book about his childhood in Ireland, Birds of the Grey Wind. In 1951 he became a Corresponding Fellow of the American Ornithologists' Union and received an honorary MA from Cambridge University. In 1952 he became a member of Jesus College, Cambridge. In 1959 he received the Special Union Gold Medal of the British Ornithologists‚Äô Union on the occasion of that organisation's Centenary celebrations. He was Vice President of the British Ornithologists‚Äô Union from 1963 to 1965. In 1966 he received the Stamford Raffles Award of the Zoological Society of London for ‚Äòdistinguished contributions to ornithology‚Äô. References *Armstrong, P.H. (2000).

Origins  Bourne Capital was founded in 1989 by Robert Bourne. Bourne was previously co-founder of Local London Group (LLG), the then market leader in the London serviced office sector. The company went public in 1986, and was sold three years later for ¬£120 million. Bourne Capital's ethos was based on the same formula as LLG, i.e. to generate enhanced revenues from property investments through active management and innovative marketing, however, the new company's business model was to develop and extend this concept much further.  The company today  The company's main activities are focused on their ownership and active management of major London mixed use estates situated in Queensway, Waterloo as well as substantial development projects oversees. Within each of the London estates the company has created high- profile leisure businesses which enhance the general area, provide facilities for local businesses, tenants and residents, and, importantly, attract footfall from outside each estate. This approach to place making has resulted in high occupancies and revenues being significantly higher than could normally be achieved by traditional property investment companies. The company currently has assets of ¬£600 million.  London Estates  Queensway Bordering Hyde Park, the freehold Queensway Estate spans the top third of the street, comprising a mix of uses including over 130,000 sq ft of retail space. Bourne Capital have been in long-term discussions with Westminster City Council regarding its proposals for the estate, which include the reconfiguration and refurbishment of the retail units; three new residential developments delivering 63 new luxury homes; two office developments providing over 52,000 sq ft of workspaces; and major public realm improvements. Waterloo The Waterloo Estate comprises with significant properties on the island site opposite the train and underground stations. It includes offices, serviced offices, retail, restaurants and bars. Bourne Capital is planning to redevelop part of the Waterloo estate to create over 260,000 sqft of new office use.

It is assigned to the 3d Operations Group at Joint Base Elmendorf‚ÄìRichardson, Alaska. The squadron was first activated as the 309th Bombardment Squadron in February 1942. After training in the United States, it deployed to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, where it became the 525th Fighter-Bomber Squadron and engaged in combat until the spring of 1945, earning two Distinguished Unit Citations. After VE Day, the squadron became part of the occupation forces in Germany. Briefly inactivated in 1946, it returned to Germany a few months later. During the Cold War, the squadron served in the fighter bomber role as the 525th Fighter-Bomber Squadron and in the air defense role as the 525th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron. It became the 525th Tactical Fighter Squadron in 1969. The squadron again saw combat service in the Gulf War before inactivating in March 1992. The squadron was reactivated in its current location in September 2007. Mission The combat-ready fighter squadron is prepared for rapid worldwide deployment of a squadron of Lockheed Martin F-22A Raptor aircraft to accomplish precision engagement of surface targets using a wide variety of conventional air-to-surface munitions. The 525th trains in the fighter missions of strategic attack, interdiction, offensive counterair (air- to-surface), suppression of enemy air defenses, as well as offensive and defensive counterair (air-to-air). History =World War II= The 525th Fighter Squadron originally activated during World War II as the 309th Bombardment Squadron (Light) on 10 February 1942, to support Allied Forces in the European Theater of Operations. The squadron began training for operations at Will Rogers Field, Oklahoma, and was assigned to the 86th Bombardment Group. In August 1942, the squadron transferred to Key Field, Mississippi, to start flight training in the Douglas A-20 Havoc. A month later, the squadron was redesignated the 309th Bombardment Squadron (Dive). By year's end, the squadron started the transition to two new combat aircraft types, the Vultee A-31 Vengeance and the North American A-36 Apache. The squadron achieved combat ready status on 19 March 1943. Ready to support the war effort, the 309th Bombardment Squadron boarded the in April 1943. Twelve days after its departure from the United States, the squadron landed at La Senia Airfield, Algeria. The 309th moved to Mediouna Airfield, French Morocco, on 15 May 1943; Marnia Airfield, French Morocco, on 3 June 1943; and to Tafaraoui Airfield, Algeria on 11 June 1943. This is where the squadron acquired its first combat experience on 6 July 1943. On the squadron's first day of combat, it struck enemy entrenchments in Sicily, softening enemy resistance for General George S. Patton's invading Seventh Army. Following the invasion, the 309th Bombardment Squadron set up its operations in Gela Airfield, Sicily, on 20 July 1943, and to Barcellona Landing Ground, Sicily, on 27 July 1943, to support the Allied campaign against the West Coast of Italy. The 309th Bombardment Squadron was redesignated the 525th Fighter-Bomber Squadron on 23 August 1943. While in Italy, the 525th moved several more times while participating in the Rome-Arno campaign. Bases for the 525th included Sele Airfield, Serretella Airfield, and Pomigliano Airfield in 1943. During 1944, the squadron operated from Marcianise Airfield, Ciampino Airport, Orbetello Airfield, Grosseto Airfield, Italy and Poretta Airfield, Corsica. Two of the more famous battles during the Italian campaigns were Salerno and the Battle of Monte Cassino. The 525th Fighter-Bomber Squadron figured prominently in these battles, providing air support to Allied ground forces. In 1944, the 525th transitioned to the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. Along with the new aircraft the 525th was redesignated the 525th Fighter Squadron on 30 May 1944. In February 1945, the squadron moved to Tatonville Airfield, France, to fly missions against Germany. Two months later it moved into Germany, establishing its headquarters at Braunshardt Airfield on 18 April 1945. The 525th flew its last combat mission on 8 May 1945, and postwar the headquarters moved to AAF Station Schweinfurt on 23 October 1945. =Cold War= The 525th moved to Bolling Field, District of Columbia on 23 October 1945, as it awaited the realignment of U.S. Forces under the Status of Forces Agreements at the end of World War II. The 525thwas temporarily inactivated on 31 March 1946. 525th FS F-84EAircraft is Republic F-84E-10-RE Thunderjet, serial 49-2270. It was reactivated on 20 August 1946, at AAF Station Nordholz, Germany, again flying the P-47 Thunderbolt. The squadron made three more moves in Germany; to Lechfeld Air Base on 13 November 1946, Bad Kissingen Air Base on 5 March 1947, and then to Neubiberg Air Base on 12 June 1947, where the squadron was the closest operational Air Force unit to the Iron Curtain. On 20 January 1950, the 525th Fighter Squadron was redesignated the 525th Fighter-Bomber Squadron. In October 1950, the squadron transitioned to its first jet aircraft, the Republic F-84E Thunderjet and operated under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program. As a part of MDAP, the 525th trained pilots and ground crews of many European and Middle Eastern countries. thumb525th FIS F-86D SabreAircraft is North American F-86D-35-NA Sabre, serial 51-8377. The 525th moved to Landstuhl Air Base, Germany on 20 November 1952, where it transitioned to the North American F-86 Sabre. The F-86 was Europe's first all-weather fighter- interceptor, and the 86th Fighter Group was the first to fly it in Europe. The 525th first flew the F-86F Sabre on 14 April 1953. Flying the F-86 in the air defense role, the 525th was redesignated as the 525th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron on 9 August 1954. In 1957, the squadrons of the 86th Group were dispersed throughout Europe to provide better air defense coverage and reduce vulnerability to attack. On 12 February 1957, the squadron moved to Bitburg Air Base, Germany. The 525th was the only squadron at Bitburg to maintain air defense alert for the next 20 years. F-102As of the 525th FIS at Bitburg, in 1967 The 525th received its first Convair F-102 Delta Dagger in February 1959 and was selected to represent the U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) at the 1959 William Tell competition. Although new to its aircraft, the 525th took the lead in the competition and held it until the last event when it was nosed out by a few points. In 1965, 1967, and 1971 the 525th was chosen as the Sector III representative to the NATO Air Superiority Competitions. In each competition, the squadron made an outstanding showing, winning the Guynemer Trophy for the best sector performance in 1971. F-4Es of the 525th Tactical fighter squadron ‚Äì 1972 The 525th became part of the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing on 1 November 1968. On 1 October 1969, the squadron was redesignated the 525th Tactical Fighter Squadron. Still maintaining two aircraft on 24-hour air defense alert status, the 525th's new mission now included close air support and limited nuclear air-to-ground delivery. Additionally, on 16 November 1969, the 525th became the first squadron in Germany to fly the McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom II. The 525th was subsequently nominated by USAFE for the Hughes Trophy in 1969. In 1970 and 1971, the 525th was awarded the Allied Forces Central Europe Scroll of Honor. This award for \\"outstanding operational achievement\\" was given for twice consecutively earning the rating of \\"1\\" on tactical evaluations by Allied Air Forces Central Europe. In 1974, the 525th was nominated by USAFE again for the Hughes Trophy, and received a commendable citation in a close finals competition. That year the squadron established Dissimilar Air Combat Tactics (DACT) training with the Northrop F-5 Tiger II aggressor squadron at RAF Alconbury, England. Later, the squadron was the first in USAFE to establish DACT programs with non-aggressor and non-USAF adversaries. The 525th was chosen to be the first squadron in Europe to fly the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. 525th Tactical Fighter Squadron F-15D EagleAircraft is McDonnell Douglas F-15D-25-MC Eagle, serial 79-8. 525th pilots flew the first 23 F-15 Eagles to Europe on 27 April 1977 during a non- stop deployment from Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, to Bitburg. Operation Ready Eagle became a success when, 18 hours after arrival at Bitburg, the squadron's pilots were sitting five-minute alert status with two of the F-15s. After less than one month on station, the Bulldogs were declared Europe's first operationally ready F-15 squadron on 26 May 1977. In 1978, the 525th was featured as part of the McDonnell Douglas film, \\"Eagles in Defense of Europe.\\" In October 1979, the 525th flew the first training missions at the new Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation range at Decimomannu Air Base, Sardinia, Italy. In 1984, the squadron participated in an exchange with the French Air Force, sending six F-15s to Orange-Caritat Air Base, France, in exchange for four Mirage F-1 aircraft. The French pilots flew for several weeks with the 525th and operated out of its operations facilities at Bitburg. In 1986, and again in 1987, the 525th deployed to Morocco and set up bare base operations at Sidi Slimane Air Base. The 525th lived and functioned for four weeks out of tents and flew its missions with Mirage F-1 and F-5 aircraft from Morocco. In November 1988, the 525th won USAFE's Excalibur air-to-air weapons competition. In April 1989, the squadron set a wing record for the most sorties in one month, flying 678 sorties, with 14 aircraft, while deployed to Decimomannu Air Base, Italy. =Gulf War= In August 1990, Iraqi military forces attacked and occupied the nation of Kuwait, precipitating the Gulf War. As a result, the 525th deployed to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, in December 1990. When the squadron arrived at Incirlik it joined General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons from Spain, General Dynamics F-111 Aardvarks from England, Wild Weasels from Germany, Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers from Texas, and Boeing E-3 Sentry and other electronic combat support aircraft from around the world. These units, deployed to Incirlik Air Base, formed the 7440th Combat Wing (Provisional). On the night of 17 January 1991, the squadron flew its first strike against Iraq. On 19 January 1991, two 525th pilots used AIM-7 Sparrow radar missiles to destroy two Iraqi Mirage F-1s. During the next six weeks, until the cease- fire, the 525th flew around the clock, protecting two strikes per day and one strike each night. These strikes targeted military airfields, nuclear and chemical facilities, communications centers, power plants, and oil refineries and storage facilities in northern Iraq. By the middle of February, the 525th was attacking Baghdad. In addition to protecting strike aircraft, the 525th was frequently tasked to man barrier Combat Air Patrols in eastern Iraq to destroy Iraqi fighters attempting to flee to Iran. These missions, often lasting in excess of five hours, required the squadron to operate more than 150 miles behind enemy lines without any support assets. The squadron flew 1,329 combat sorties for a total of 3,550 combat hours during operations against Iraq. The squadron shot down six enemy aircraft without losing any of its own aircraft. On 13 March 1991, the 525th returned to Bitburg. The squadron deployed back to Incirlik AB on 5 April 1991 to support Operation Provide Comfort. Following the war against Iraq, numerous Kurdish refugees fled northward from the remaining forces of Saddam Hussein. The United States initiated Operation Provide Comfort, to drop food and supplies to these refugees concentrated in Iraq along the Turkish border. Because tensions between the Iraqi and Allied forces in the area remained quite high, the 525th was called back to Turkey in April 1991 to protect the vulnerable Allied cargo aircraft. In addition, the 525th was tasked, as part of the operation, to fly at low altitude over Iraq and provide intelligence updates of Iraqi troop and equipment locations. Between 5 April and 25 May 1991, the 525th flew 285 sorties over Iraq in support of Operation Provide Comfort without a single Allied aircraft being lost in Iraq due to hostile fire. =Recent Events= The 525th deployed to Leeuwarden Air Base, Netherlands, during October 1991. In December 1991, the Bulldogs deployed to RAF Bentwaters, England, to train on the new North Sea Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation range. The final weapons training deployment for the 525th was at Leeuwarden Air Base, Netherlands, from 16‚Äì27 March 1992. The 525th inactivated at Bitburg AB on 1 April 1992. After 15 years of inactivation, Pacific Air Forces activated the 525th Fighter Squadron at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, on 29 October 2007. The 525th Fighter Squadron is now armed with the Air Force's newest fighter aircraft, the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor.

SIP's are an HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs) approved, tax efficient all employee plan, which provides companies with the flexibility to tailor the plan to meet their business needs. SIPs are becoming increasingly popular with companies that want to engage their workforce and recruit and retain key employees. From 6 April 2014, HMRC approval will no longer be required for a SIP to obtain tax benefits, instead an employer is required to self-certify that the SIP meets the requirements of the relevant legislation. Accordingly, from 6 April 2014, a SIP should no longer be referred to as an HMRC approved plan. As of February 2020, SIPs are one of 4 HMRC approved share option schemes, alongside Company Share Option Plans (CSOPs), Enterprise Management Incentives (EMI), and Savings Related Share Option Schemes (SAYE) . There are 4 main elements to the SIP from which companies can choose to use one or more of the following: Free Shares, Partnership Shares, Matching Shares, Dividend Shares.  Free Shares  Companies can give up to ¬£3,600 of Free Shares to employees in each tax year (from 6 April 2014).https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/264432/4._Share_incentive_plan_limits.pdf A participating employee can only take their Free Shares out of the SIP in the 3-year period from the date of award if they leave the company. Income Tax and National Insurance may be payable on the market value of the shares at the date of removal, unless you leave due to injury or disability, redundancy, if the company or part of the business you work for is sold out of the group, retirement, or death. If Free Shares are removed between 3 and 5 years from the date of award, then Income Tax and National Insurance will be due on the lower value of the Free Shares at the date of award and their market value on the date on which they are withdrawn from the SIP. If the Free Shares remain in the SIP for more than 5 years, there will be no Income Tax or National Insurance liability when the shares are removed from the SIP. In certain circumstances, prescribed by HMRC, there will be no Income Tax or National Insurance liability when the employee leaves the company, no matter how long the shares have been held in the plan.  Partnership Shares  Employees can use their pre-tax salary to buy shares up to a maximum of ¬£1,800 or 10% of salary (whichever is the lower) each year. Partnership Shares will be free of Income Tax and National Insurance at the date of purchase. If an employee takes their Partnership Shares out of the SIP within 3 years of the date of purchase, Income Tax and National Insurance will be payable on the market value of the shares at the date of removal. If the Partnership Shares are removed between 3 and 5 years from the date of purchase, then Income Tax and National Insurance will be due on the lower of the value of the Partnership Shares at the date of award and their market value on the date on which they are withdrawn from the SIP. If the Partnership Shares remain in the SIP for more than 5 years no Income Tax or National Insurance is payable when the shares are eventually removed from the SIP. The purchase of Partnership Shares can be funded in 2 ways; either a single lump sum contribution once a year; or monthly contributions (subject to a maximum of ¬£125 per month or 10% of salary (¬£150 per month from 6 April 2014), whichever is the lower, and a minimum of ¬£10 per month). If the employee opts to make a lump sum contribution, the Partnership Shares must be purchased within 30 days of the deduction from salary. Contributions from salary can be accumulated for a period of up to 12 months. Partnership Shares must be purchased within 30 days of the end of the accumulation period; or contributions from monthly salary can be used to buy Partnership Shares within 30 days of the deduction.  Matching Shares  The company can give employees up to 2 Matching Shares for each Partnership Share they buy. These shares will be free of Income Tax and National Insurance at the date of award. An employee can normally only take their Matching Shares out of the SIP in the 3-year period from the date of award if they leave the company. Income Tax and National Insurance will be payable on the market value of the shares at the date of removal. If the Matching Shares are removed between 3 and 5 years from the date of purchase, then Income Tax and National Insurance will be due on the lower of the value of the Matching Shares at the date of award and their market value on the date on which they are withdrawn from the SIP. If the Matching Shares remain in the SIP for more than 5 years no Income Tax or National Insurance is payable when the shares are eventually removed from the SIP. In certain circumstances, prescribed by HMRC, there can be no Income Tax or National Insurance liability when the employee leaves the company, no matter how long the shares have been held in the plan..  Dividend Shares  Dividends paid on SIP shares can be re-invested in further shares known as Dividend Shares. Before 6 April 2013, the maximum amount of dividend reinvestment was ¬£1,500 per participant in a tax year. From 6 April 2013, the statutory reinvestment limit ceased to apply, however employers may continue to specify a limit if they choose. These shares are free of Income Tax and National Insurance at the date of purchase. An employee can only take their Dividend Shares out of the SIP in the 3-year period from the date of award if they leave the company. Dividend Shares are subject to a 3-year holding period. If the shares are removed after 3 years from the date of award there is no Income Tax or National Insurance liability. In certain circumstances, prescribed by HMRC, there can be no Income Tax or National Insurance liability when the employee leaves the company, no matter how long the shares have been held in the plan.  Benefits of a SIP  For the employee SIPs provide the opportunity to invest pre-tax salary in the company they work for and become a share holder. By participating in a company's SIP an employee is able to share in the future success of the company. ResearchUnleasing the Power of Employee Ownership, 1998; Hewitts Associates has also shown that a satisfied and incentivised workforce is more productive than an unsatisfied or non-incentivised workforce. For the company a SIP provides a number of advantages. Employees with a vested interest in the success and performance of a company are more motivated to work as their investment is based upon the performance of the company. SIP's are also an extremely effective tool for staff retention within a company as participants are only liable to pay tax on shares acquired in the last 5 years and will only be eligible for Matching shares if they stay with the company for 3 years after the purchase of Partnership shares. Increasing employee retention in this way results in less expenditure for the company on overheads such as recruitment and the training of new recruits. Companies running a SIP are also able to take advantage of Corporation tax relief for a variety of reasons including amongst others, the costs incurred putting the scheme in place & subsequent running costs including funding for maintenance of a trust.

In all, it consisted of five ditches, four earthworks, and three levelled courtyards. A fortified settlement was built at the southeast end. In addition, the levelled hilltop areas were surrounded by palisades of sharpened poles. Artefacts dating from the early 1st century to the early second millennium were found during 21st century excavations. The site was eventually abandoned due to continued erosion and the shrinking hilltop. Molavƒón≈≥ II hill fort was built 400 m upstream in the 12th century on another projection at the confluence of the river ≈†e≈°uvis and its tributary, the Jaujupis. Only the northeast and east sides were not protected by natural defences and so were instead guarded by a series of four earthworks and four ditches. A 20 m long earthwork with a corresponding ditch was constructed on the southwest slope. The flat hilltop was ringed by a wooden defensive wall. A tower was erected on the big earthwork, and wooden palisades on the other earthworks. A 2009 excavation discovered pottery dating to the 12th‚Äì14th centuries. Dry stone revetting was also found in one ditch.

In the British Press Awards of 1973, he was named Journalist of the Year for his work on labour conditions in South Africa, and he has also been a presenter of BBC Television's Newsnight. Since 2004, he has edited The Good Hotel Guide. He is not to be confused with another BBC producer of the same name, Adam Jocelyn Raphael (1937‚Äì1999).Alex Kirby Obituary: Adam [Jocelyn Raphael], The Independent, 14 May 1999 Early life Charterhouse School The son of Geoffrey George Raphael and his wife Nancy Raphael (n√©e Rose), Raphael was educated at two independent schools: Arnold House School in St John's Wood in north-west London, and Charterhouse in Godalming, Surrey (where he was a contemporary of David Dimbleby), followed by Oriel College, Oxford, graduating with a BA with Honours in History.'RAPHAEL, Adam Eliot Geoffrey' in Who's Who 2008, retrieved 26 June 2008, from RAPHAEL, Adam Eliot Geoffrey Career Raphael undertook national service with the Royal Artillery, and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant on 1 June 1957, subsequently serving in Germany. After leaving the army, he went to Oriel College, Oxford where he graduated with a second-class degree in history in 1961. After university, Raphael went to the USA where he worked as a copy boy at The Washington Post under Ben Bradlee, its editor. Returning from the US in 1962, he was employed by Westminster Press first on the Swindon Evening Advertiser and then on the Bath Evening Chronicle as a reporter and film critic. In 1965 he arrived in Fleet Street as a reporter on The Guardian, working as the newspaper's motoring correspondent from 1967 to 1968 before serving overseas as its foreign correspondent in Washington, D.C., and South Africa from 1969 to 1973. On his return to London, he was appointed as The Guardian's consumer affairs columnist from 1974 to 1976, before moving to The Observer as political correspondent, 1976‚Äì1981, and then as the political editor, 1981‚Äì1986. In 1984 and 1989, The Observer printed articles by Raphael which suggested that the lobbyist Ian Greer had been paying members of parliament to table parliamentary questions, an early stage of the Cash for Questions scandal.The Webs They Weave online, accessed 26 June 2008 In 1987, Raphael briefly moved to BBC Television as a presenter of its daily current affairs programme, Newsnight (1987‚Äì1988). He returned to the paper in 1988 as an assistant Editor, and Executive Editor from 1988 to 1993. In March 1989 The Observer published an article by Raphael which claimed that British Aerospace was selling Tornado aircraft to Jordan at inflated prices to include the cost of bribes. Raphael's colleague David Leigh complained to the directors of The Observer that Raphael had written it to suit Lonrho, which had a stake in British Aerospace's rival, Dassault Aviation. The MP Dale Campbell-Savours tabled motions in the House of Commons denouncing the article. The directors of The Observer dismissed Leigh's complaint, and he resigned from the newspaper in protest. In 1989, Raphael published a book on some libel cases, My Learned Friends: an Insider's View of the Jeffrey Archer Case and Other Notorious Actions, which focused on the remarkable case of Jeffrey Archer v. The Daily Star (1987). In 1994, he moved to The Economist as a writer on home affairs, then as political correspondent, 1994 to 2004. Among many articles Raphael has published in The Economist is Theft: Sitting on the Fence,Raphael, A. (1998) Theft: Sitting on the Fence. The Economist. 23 May. p35. which helped to popularise the Market Reduction Approach to theft ‚Äì designed by Mike Sutton\\\\- and revealed to the wider public the role of stolen goods markets in creating a demand for supply by theft and that the size of the stolen goods economy in Britain was ¬£1.5 billion ($2.4 billion) annually. In 1994, Raphael's book Ultimate Risk,Ultimate Risk: the inside story of the Lloyd's catastrophe (London, Four Walls Eight Windows, 1994, ) the story of the Lloyd's of London catastrophe, became a best-seller in the UK. Between 1988 and 1992 Lloyd's recorded losses of some twelve billion US dollars, and Raphael wrote that it thus managed to \\"pauperize, if not bankrupt, as many as two in five of those who provided the market's capital.\\" Raphael was himself a Lloyd's Name, and was thus able to write as an insider, one of the victims of the affair.Wheatcroft, Geoffrey, Insuring Disaster, 26 November 1995. The New York Times, accessed 26 June 2008 In 1987, Raphael was subpoenaed as a witness by the Daily Star when Jeffrey Archer sued it over a story that he had consorted with a prostitute, Monica Coghlan. Raphael was a crucial witness as The Observer's political editor. When the story broke in the News of the World, he rang Archer, who was then Vice-Chairman of the Conservative Party and asked him whether it was true. Archer replied that he had met Monica 'on only one occasion' and that he had been disgracefully set up by the paper. This evidence was central to the subsequent libel trial. The judge, Bernie Cornfield, described Raphael as 'a thorn in Archer‚Äôs side' but the jury chose to believe Archer that he had never met Monica and awarded him ¬£500,000 in damages. In the middle of the trial, Raphael was attacked by the editor of the Mail on Sunday, Stewart Steven, for having betrayed Archer as a source. This led to another libel action which ended with the Mail on Sunday paying Raphael ¬£40,000 in costs and damages. Shortly after the Archer trial, Raphael wrote My Learned Friends (1989) in which he alleged that the jury had been misled by Archer‚Äôs alibi witnesses. It took another decade for the truth to emerge. In 1999, Raphael wrote an article in The Economist which said that Archer had asked him to change his evidence and that he had lied about where he had been on the night he met Monica. Two years later in 2001 Archer was tried for perjury and jailed for four years. Raphael has been Editor of The Good Hotel Guide since 2004 and also an Associate Editor of Transport Times since 2005. Private life In 1970, Raphael married Caroline Rayner Ellis, and they have one son and one daughter. In Who's Who, he gives his recreations as \\"tennis, golf, skiing\\", and his clubs as the Garrick, the Hurlingham, and the Royal Automobile Club.

The episode revolves around Teddy Leopold (Robert Wagner), who is found dead on Charlie (Charlie Sheen)'s bed during his mother's wedding reception. A crime scene investigation crew searches Charlie's house, trying to find out who murdered Teddy. \\"Fish in a Drawer\\" aired May 5, 2008 on CBS, and was watched by approximately 13 million viewers, making it the night's third most watched show, behind CSI: Miami and Dancing with the Stars.  Plot  At the reception of Evelyn and Teddy's wedding, Charlie still wants to marry Courtney, his new stepsister, and decides to go up to his room with her. When they lie down on the bed, in the dark, Courtney discovers that she is lying on something, when Charlie turns on the light he finds Teddy lying dead on his bed with his pants around his knees, and lipstick on his \\"Hoo Hoo\\". When Charlie tells Alan, they know they have an even bigger problem: telling their mother. After pulling Evelyn away from the piano, they tell her and she then cashes in their honeymoon tickets for a trip for one to Fiji before calling the police. After the police arrive and examine the crime scene, Charlie, Alan, Evelyn, Berta, Courtney, and Jake are brought to the station for separate questioning. Charlie ends up being more obsessed with his attractive interrogator (Jamie Rose), Alan is afraid of going to jail and can not talk straight, Evelyn spends more time complaining about their coffee, Berta turns out to be a waste of time, and Jake talks about food. It gets clear pretty soon that Evelyn is an easy target, since almost all of her prior husbands had died. Evelyn mentions her first husband died from food poisoning, explaining she was a young bride, just learning to cook, and didn't know you couldn't \\"keep fish in a drawer\\". After the files of Teddy and his daughter Courtney come back, the crime team discovers that their real names are Nathan Krunk and Sylvia Fishman, and they are not even related. It turns out that Sylvia and Nathan actually were con artists. The crime team thought that Nathan was murdered, because of the bruise on the back of his head, but it was revealed that he died of a heart attack, while attempting to have sex with Sylvia. The bruise had occurred two days earlier, when he bumped his head while having sex with Sylvia. As the police lead Sylvia away, Charlie attempts to tell her off for conning him, but he can only manage to say \\"I'll wait for you.\\"  Production  In 2007, Chuck Lorre, the creator of Two and a Half Men, contacted Carol Mendelsohn, the show runner of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, about a crossover. The first reactions to this were that it was a stupid idea. CSI writer and executive producer Naren Shankar commented that when Mendelsohn first told him about the idea he replied: \\"What a nut\\". However, that same year, the idea resurfaced, when Lorre and Mendelsohn met at the World Television Festival in Banff. Upon hearing this, the cast of both shows were surprised and not interested, but they eventually jumped aboard. In an interview with The New York Post, before the idea was fully worked out, Mendelsohn described the possible crossover as \\"a great challenge\\". When Mendelsohn was giving a talk, she accidentally mentioned the crossover, as a result Variety was already inquiring about the crossover episodes that same day. Mendelsohn eventually revealed the crossover at the Banff event in Canada. After the episode was taped, Lorre stated: \\"The biggest challenge for us was doing a comedy with a murder in it. Generally our stories are a little lighter. Would our audience go with a dead body in it? There was a moment where it could have gone either way. I think the results were spectacular. It turned out to be a really funny episode.\\" \\"Fish in a Drawer\\" was written by Carol Mendelsohn and Naren Shankar and directed by Jeff Melman. As an inside joke, George Eads, who plays crime scene investigator Nick Stokes on CSI made a cameo as a guest at the wedding reception. Three days after the initial airing of \\"Fish in a Drawer\\", \\"Two and a Half Deaths\\", the corresponding CSI episode, aired on CBS. However, in an early Zap2it interview, both Mendelsohn and Lorre stated that this might be the last time a crossover like this might occur.  Reception  \\"Fish in a Drawer\\" was broadcast on May 5, 2008 on CBS, and was watched by 13.61 million viewers, making it the night's third most watched show, behind CSI: Miami and Dancing with the Stars. The episode was the fifth most watched program on CBS in the week of May 5 to May 11, 2008. Allison Waldman of AOL's TV Squad, stated that she found the corresponding CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode Emmy Award worthy, while she found \\"Fish in a Drawer\\", \\"not rip-roaring, but still good\\". Andy Grieser of Zap2it, said that he was attracted to the episode due to the news about the crossover, he stated he found the Faux-Catherine \\"brilliant\\" and that \\"the grainy flashbacks were the best parts\\". Conchata Ferrell submitted this episode for consideration for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards, but did not end up being nominated. The director of this episode, Jeff Melman, also submitted this episode for consideration for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series, but was not nominated either.

The lower court and the common buildings in the north east also date from the 16th century. Ch√¢teau de Guilleragues (pronunciation: [geeyerahg]) was built in many stages and went through many changes in its history. The oldest parts and foundations date back to the 12th century. Little is known about the earliest dates and status of the structure. More obvious are parts built in the 14th and 16th century. The building must have been two or three separate structures initially, which were joined at some later point. The best known occupants of the castle are the De Lavergne family, who owned the castle in the 16th and 17th centuries. In fact, a major change took place in the 1560s, where windows were enlarged and added, doors where enlarged and many decorative features were added, changing the castle from a fortified structure with defense as its main function to a livable, more luxurious stately home. The then-ruined ch√¢teau, in 1861 In a large, intricate relief above the main entrance with columns, symbols and lions, the year '1564' is inscribed on the family coat of arms. This portal is listed separately in the historical monument (IMH) register. Displayed below is the coat of arms in detail, found elsewhere within the castle. It is the combination of Lavergne and Lestonnac arms. The residence belonged in the 17th century to Gabriel-Joseph de Lavergne, Vicomte de Guilleragues, a brilliant diplomat and author of the Les Lettres portugaises (En. Letters of a Portuguese Nun).

Early life and military service  Davis was born on May 18, 1894 in Greenville, South Carolina, though he settled in Tallahassee, Florida with his family at an early age. He was admitted to the Florida Bar in 1914 and became a practicing attorney in Wakulla County, Florida. In 1917, Davis, a Democrat, became the Special Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida. He resigned the same year in order to enlist in the Florida Army National Guard, serving as a private with the 124th Infantry during World War I, though he did not go overseas with the American Expeditionary Force. On December 10, 1918, Davis was discharged from the United States Army and was sent to Camp Hancock, near Augusta, Georgia, in order to begin his officers' training. Davis quickly worked his way up the ranks, becoming a lieutenant and later a major in the Army Reserve Corps. Davis commanded Company M of the 124th Infantry, which, in 1924, was designated as the Governor's Guards, a historic infantry unit dating back to the Third Seminole War. Davis retired from the military in 1927.  Political career  After his return to Florida from Camp Hancock in 1919, Davis was appointed as the Prosecuting Attorney for Leon County, Florida by Governor Sidney Johnson Catts. In 1920, Davis was elected to the Florida House of Representatives, representing Leon County. He was re-elected in 1922 and 1924. Davis also served as the special counsel for the Florida Railroad Commission in 1925 He was re-elected to the Florida House in 1926 and was selected Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives in 1927. He would only serve for a few months, however, as he was appointed the 24th Florida Attorney General on June 4, 1927 by Governor John W. Martin, finishing the term of J. B. Johnson, who had been appointed to a state circuit court. Davis was elected to a full term in 1928. On March 9, 1931, Governor Doyle E. Carlton appointed Davis to the Supreme Court of Florida. Davis was selected as Chief Justice on January 10, 1933, serving in that role until January 8, 1935. He continued to serve on the bench until his death in 1937.  Personal life  In 1921, Davis married Frances M. Chambers. They had two daughters Marilyn and Hazel D. Davis was a practicing Methodist. He was a member of many veterans' organizations, including the American Legion, the Military Order of the World Wars, the Reserve Officers Association, and the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Additionally, Davis was also a member of several fraternal orders, namely the Freemasons, the Knights Templar, the Shriners, Elks, Lions, Odd Fellows, and Phi Alpha Delta. Death On June 20, 1937, Davis died of a sudden heart attack while on a visit to Jacksonville, Florida. He is buried in Tallahassee's Old City Cemetery.

The Sommerfeld number is very important in lubrication analysis because it contains all the variables normally specified by the designer. The Sommerfeld number is named after Arnold Sommerfeld (1868‚Äì1951). Definition The Sommerfeld Number is typically defined by the following equation.Shigley 1989, p.484. : \\\\mathrm{S} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{r}{c} \\\\right)^2 \\\\frac {\\\\mu N}{P} Where: : S is the Sommerfeld Number or bearing characteristic number : r is the shaft radius : c is the radial clearance : ¬µ is the absolute viscosity of the lubricant : N is the speed of the rotating shaft in rev/s : P is the load per unit of projected bearing area The second part of the equation is seen to be the Hersey number. However, an alternative definition for S is used in some texts based on angular velocity:Williams, J. 1994. Engineering Tribology. p267. : \\\\mathrm{S} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{r}{c} \\\\right)^2 \\\\frac {\\\\mu \\\\N}{P} =\\\\left( \\\\frac{r}{c} \\\\right)^2 \\\\frac {\\\\mu \\\\omega L D}{W} Where: : \\\\omega is angular velocity of the shaft in rad/s. : W is the applied load : L is the bearing length : D is the bearing diameter It is therefore necessary to check which definition is being used when referring to design data or textbooks, since the value of S will differ by a factor of 2œÄ.  Derivation  = Petroff's Law = Petroff's method of lubrication analysis, which assumes a concentric shaft and bearing, was the first to explain the phenomenon of bearing friction. This method, which ultimately produces the equation known as Petroff's Law, is useful because it defines groups of relevant dimensionless parameters, and predicts a fairly accurate coefficient of friction, even when the shaft is not concentric.Shigley 1989, p.483. Considering a vertical shaft rotating inside a bearing, it can be assumed that the bearing is subjected to a negligible load, the radial clearance space is completely filled with lubricant, and that leakage is negligible. The surface velocity of the shaft is: U = 2 \\\\pi r N, where N is the rotational speed of the shaft in rev/s. The shear stress in the lubricant can be represented as follows: :\\\\tau = \\\\mu \\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right_{y = 0} Assuming a constant rate of shear, :\\\\tau = \\\\mu \\\\frac{U}{h} = \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi r \\\\mu N}{c} The torque required to shear the film is :T = \\\\left( \\\\tau A \\\\right) \\\\left( r \\\\right) = \\\\left( \\\\frac {2 \\\\pi r \\\\mu N}{c} \\\\right) \\\\left( 2 \\\\pi r l \\\\right) \\\\left( r \\\\right) = \\\\frac {4 \\\\pi^2 r^3 l \\\\mu N}{c} If a small radial load W acts on the shaft and hence the bearing, the frictional drag force can be considered equal to the product fW, with the friction torque represented as :T = f Wr = 2 r^2 f l P Where : W is the force acting on the bearing : P is the radial load per unit of project bearing area (Pressure) : f is the coefficient of friction If the small radial load W is considered negligible, setting the two expressions for torque equal to one another and solving for the coefficient of friction yields f = 2 \\\\pi^2 \\\\frac{\\\\mu N}{P} \\\\frac{r}{c} Which is known as Petroff's Law or the Petroff equation. It provides a quick and simple means of obtaining reasonable estimates of coefficients of friction of lightly loaded bearings.

Unlike most other EF-mount lenses, it does not provide autofocus. Overview The TS-E 45 mm f/2.8 provides three degrees of freedom, allowing ¬±8¬∞ tilt with respect to the image plane and ¬±11 mm shift with respect to the center of the image area; the movements can be rotated ¬±90¬∞ about the lens axis, though not independently. Shifting allows adjusting the position of the subject in the image area without moving the camera back; it is often used to avoid convergence of parallel lines, such as when photographing a tall building. Tilting the lens relies on the Scheimpflug principle to rotate the plane of focus away from parallel to the image plane; this can be used either to have all parts of an inclined subject sharply rendered, or to restrict sharpness to a small part of a scene. Tilting the lens results in a wedge-shaped depth of field that may be a better fit to some scenes than the depth of field between two parallel planes that results without tilt. Unlike most view cameras, the shift mechanism allows shifts along only one axis, and the tilt mechanism allows tilts about only one axis; however, the rotation of the mechanisms allows the orientations of the axes to be changed, providing, in effect, combined tilt and swing, and combined rise/fall and lateral shift. The tilt and shift functions cannot be independently rotated. The lens is supplied with these functions at 90¬∞ to each other (e.g., providing tilt and lateral shift); they can be changed to work in the same directions (e.g., providing tilt and rise/fall) by removing four screws, rotating the front of the lens 90¬∞, and reinstalling the screws.

Origins Mackenzie was the son of Kenneth Mackenzie, 1st Lord Mackenzie of Kintail (died 1611), and Isobel, the daughter of Sir Gilbert Ogilvie of Powrie. The Mackenzies were a clan from Ross-shire that had risen to prominence in the 15th century during the disintegration of the Lordship of the Isles. On the death in 1633 of his elder half-brother Colin without male heirs, Mackenzie inherited his estates and the title of Earl of Seaforth. Prior to that point, he was known as George Mackenzie of Kildun. Estates As a result of the acquisitive proclivities of Seaforth's ancestors, his estates were very extensive. In 1633 he was \\"served heir male to his brother ‚Ä¶ in the lands and barony of Ellandonnan, including the barony of Lochalsh, in which was included the barony of the lands and towns of Lochcarron, namely, the towns and lands of Auchnaschelloch, Coullin (Coulin), Edderancharron, Attadill, Ruychichan, Brecklach, Achachoull, Dalmartyne, with fishings in salt water and fresh, Dalcharlarie, Arrinachteg (Arineckaig), Achintie, Slumba (Slumbay), Doune, Stromcarronach (Strome Carronach), in the Earldom of Ross, of the old extent of ¬£13 6s 8d, and also the towns of Kisserin, and lands of Strome, with fishings in salt and fresh water, and the towns and lands of Torridan with the pertinents of the Castle of Strome; Lochalsh, Lochcarron, and Kisserin, including the davach of Achvanie, the davach of Achnatrait (Achintraid?), the davach of Stromcastell, Ardnagald, Ardneskan, and Blaad, and the half davach of Sannachan (Sanachan), Rassoll (Rassal), Meikle Strome, and Rerag (Reraig), in the Earldom of Ross, together of the old extent of ¬£8 13s 4d.\\" He was served heir male to his father Kenneth, Lord Mackenzie of Kintail, in the lands and barony of Pluscardine, on 14 January 1620; and had charters of Balmungie and Avoch, on 18 July 1635; of Raasay, on 18 February 1637 and of Lochalsh, on 4 July 1642. Civil War In the Bishops War, Seaforth, although personally attached to the king, was to be found on the side of the Covenant. He was appointed General of the Covenanters north of the Spey, but disbanded his army on Montrose‚Äôs instructions following the Pacification of Berwick, which concluded on 18 June 1639. When Montrose joined the king's side, Seaforth too was suspected of lukewarmness for the Covenant. In 1640, he was temporarily imprisoned as a precautionary measure and in 1641, when the King arrived in Scotland, Seaforth was persuaded by the Earl of Traquair to enter into a bond with the Earls of Montrose, Wigtown, Atholl and Home against the Covenanters. However, he continued to equivocate, declining the king's offer of chief justice general of the Isles and taking up arms against Montrose after his victory at Aberdeen in September 1644. Montrose (with an army of only 1,500) was preparing to attack his forces of about 5,000, when he was informed of Argyll's descent on Lochaber. Changing his route, Montrose won a famous victory at Inverlochy against Argyll on 2 February 1645. Following this victory, Seaforth met Montrose between Elgin and Forres and was held prisoner for several days, but was subsequently released, having apparently sworn allegiance to the King and having promised never again under any circumstances to take up arms against him. Notwithstanding this promise, he shortly afterwards joined Sir John Hurry the Covenanting general. On 9 May 1645 he took part in the Battle of Auldearn, which was fought between Hurry's army of Sutherlands, Mackenzies, Frasers, Roses and Brodies and Montrose's army of Gordons, Macdonalds, Macphersons, Mackintoshes and Irish. The result was another victory for Montrose, but the Mackenzies emerged largely unscathed. The Reverend John Macrae (d. 1704) gave a lengthy account of the battle (in the Ardintoul manuscript) which suggested that there had been deliberate collusion between Montrose, Hurry and Seaforth. Be that as it may, Seaforth subsequently refused a commission from the Committee of Estates appointing him as their Lieutenant north of the Spey and was excommunicated by the General Assembly. He then joined Montrose publicly at the siege of Inverness in April 1646. Clan affairs After Montrose's departure for Norway in September 1646, compulsory loans were levied against leading Royalists. Sixteen Mackenzies were ordered to provide loans totaling ¬£28,666 (Scottish), but it appears that the authorities experienced great difficulties in enforcing their payment. The list provides an interesting snapshot of the perceived resources of some of the leading clan members of the time: *Thomas Mackenzie of Pluscarden: ¬£2,000; *Alexander Mackenzie of Kilcoy: ¬£2,000; *Roderick Mackenzie of Redcastle: ¬£2,000; *Alexander Mackenzie of Coul: ¬£6,000; *Kenneth Mackenzie of Gairloch: ¬£3,333 6s.8d; *Hector Mackenzie of Scotsburn: ¬£2,000; *Roderick Mackenzie of Davochmaluag: ¬£1,333 6s.8d; *John Mackenzie of Davach- Cairn: ¬£1,333 6s.8d; *William Mackenzie of Multavie: ¬£1,000; *Kenneth Mackenzie of Scatwell: ¬£2,000; *Thomas Mackenzie of Inverlael: ¬£1,333 6s.8d; *Colin Mackenzie of Mullochie: ¬£666 13s.4d; *Donald Mackenzie of Logie: ¬£666 13s.4d; *Kenneth Mackenzie of Assynt: ¬£1,000; *Colin Mackenzie of Kincraig: ¬£1,000; *Alexander Mackenzie of Suddie: ¬£1,000. Seaforth's involvement in public affairs did not prevent him from pursuing (in the manner of his forebears) his own more personal concerns. In particular, he embarked on a remorseless campaign to wrest Assynt from the Macleods, laying siege to the castle of Donald Ban Mor Macleod on the Isle of Assynt in May 1646. His men were said (in a later complaint by the Macleods) to have carried away 3,000 cows, 2,000 horses and 7,000 sheep and goats, as well as burning the habitations of 180 families. Final years In 1648 Seaforth again raised a body of 4000 men in the Western Islands and Ross-shire, whom he led south, to aid the King's cause, but after joining in a few skirmishes under Lanark, they returned home to \\"cut their corn which was now ready for their sickles.\\" During the whole of this period Seaforth's fidelity to the Royal cause was open to considerable suspicion, and when Charles I threw himself into the hands of the Scots at Newark, and ordered Montrose to disband his forces, Earl George, always trying to be on the winning side, came in to Middleton, and made terms with the Committee of Estates; but the Church, by whom he had previously been excommunicated, continued implacable, and would only agree to be satisfied by a public penance in sackcloth within the High Church of Edinburgh. The proud Earl consented, underwent this ignominious and degrading ceremonial, and his sentence of excommunication was then removed. Notwithstanding this public humiliation, after the death of Charles I, Seaforth, in a final act of tergiversation, went over to Holland in 1649, and joined Charles II, by whom he was made Principal Secretary of State for Scotland, the duties of which, however, he never had the opportunity of performing. Death and posterity When Seaforth received the news of the disastrous defeat of the king's forces at Worcester, he fell into a profound melancholy and died in August 1651, in Schiedam, Holland. Early in life, he had married Barbara, daughter of Arthur, Lord Forbes, and had by her at least eight children, including his heir and successor, Kenneth. Of his three daughters, Jean married first John, Earl of Mar, and secondly Andrew Fraser, 3rd Lord Fraser; Margaret married Sir William Sinclair of Mey; and Barbara married Sir John Urquhart of Cromarty.

A Great Britain and England international representative forward, he played at club level in England for Whitehaven and St Helens (with whom he won the 1961 Challenge Cup), and in Australia for St. George (with whom he won the 1966 NSWRFL Premiership). Huddart is both a Whitehaven, and St Helens R.F.C. Hall of Fame inductee. He is also the father of the late rugby league footballer; Milton Huddart. Background Dick Huddart was born in Flimby, Cumberland on 22 June 1936. Playing career =Britain= After playing amateur rugby for Risehow, Huddart turned professional, signing with rugby league club Whitehaven for ¬£250. Later that year he became the first Whitehaven player to be selected to play for the Great Britain national rugby league team, touring Australia with them and winning the Ashes. Huddart played right-, i.e. number 12, in Whitehaven's 14-11 victory over Australia in the 1956‚Äì57 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France match at the Recreation Ground, Whitehaven on Saturday 20 October 1956, in front of a crowd of 10,917. He won caps for Great Britain while at Whitehaven in 1958 against Australia (2 matches), and New Zealand (2 matches). Upon his return, Huddart decided to move to St. Helens, signing with them in October, 1958. During the 1959‚Äì60 season he played as a in St. Helens' 4‚Äì5 loss against Warrington in the 1959 Lancashire Cup Final at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 31 October 1959. While at St. Helens he played for Great Britain in 1959 against Australia, in 1961 against New Zealand (3 matches), in 1962 against France (2 matches), Australia (3 matches), and New Zealand (2 matches), and in 1963 against Australia. During the 1960‚Äì61 season Huddart played at and was named man of the match, winning the Lance Todd Trophy in the 12-6 victory over Wigan in the 1961 Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 13 May 1961, in front of a crowd of 94,672. He also helped Great Britain retain the Ashes in the 1962 tour of Australia. Huddart won a cap for England while at St. Helens in 1962 against France. During the 1960‚Äì61 season he played at in the 15-9 victory over Swinton in the 1960 Lancashire Cup Final at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 29 October 1960. During the 1961‚Äì62 season He played right- in the 25-9 victory over Swinton in the 1961 Lancashire Cup Final at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 11 November 1961. During the 1962‚Äì63 season he played at in the 7‚Äì4 victory over Swinton in the 1962 Lancashire Cup Final at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 27 October 1962. =Australia= Huddart moved to Australia to play for NSWRFL club St. George from the 1964 season. It was hoped he could help fill the large shoes left in the record-breaking champion St. George side's second-row by the retiring Norm Provan. Huddart went on to help the Dragons continue their dominance in that period, scoring a try in the 1966 NSWRFL season's Grand Final victory over Balmain. The turning point of that match came when Huddart and Ian Walsh put on a set move as the Balmain defence rushed up too early. Walsh burst through the line and with only the fullback to beat and passed the ball to Huddart who raced 30 yards to score. Huddart thus became the first Great Britain Test player to win a premiership in Australia. Huddart returned to Britain in 1970‚Äì71 to play a final season with Whitehaven.

The vadigo is similar in form to both the leatherjacks and the queenfish, but can be distinguished by its scaleless chest and a broad, rounded upper jaw. It is a predatory fish, preying mostly on smaller schooling fishes. The species was initially classified under the genus Centronotus before being transferred to its own monotypic genus of Campogramma. The vadigo is of minor commercial importance throughout its range, and is also considered to be a game fish. Taxonomy and naming The vadigo is the only species classified in the monotypic genus Campogramma, which itself is one of 31 genera in the family Carangidae, which contains the jacks, horse mackerels and pompanos. The Carangidae were classified as Perciform fishes in the suborder Percoidei, but most authorities now classify the carangids in the order Carangiformes along with the remoras, dolphinfishes and related families. The species was first scientifically described by Bernard Germain de Lac√©p√®de in 1801 under the name of Centronotus glaycos. In 1903, Charles Tate Regan transferred the species to a new genus, Campogramma, creating the valid combination in use today (Centronotus is now considered a synonym of Naucrates). The species has two junior synonyms, the first was described in 1941 as Oligoplites africana by Delsman and the second in 1955 by Dollfus, who named Campogramma lirio. Early phylogenetic treatments of the species placed it in the subfamily Trachinotinae without substantiating evidence. A review of the genus by Smith- Vaniz and Staiger cited several anatomical characters which were incompatible with the Trachinotinae, however would group it within the Naucratinae. They further suggested it was a close relative of Seriola, which was later reaffirmed by a comprehensive overview of the carangids by Gushiken. In this study, it was found to be most closely related to the rainbow runner, Elegatis bipinnulata, with both Campogramma and Elegatis basal members of Naucratinae. No recent genetic studies have investigated the species. The species is commonly known as the vadigo, which is the designated FishBase name, as well as the big-toothed pompano, zippered pompano, lexa and lexola. Description The vadigo is similar in form to other carangids, particularly the genera Oligoplites and Scomberoides, commonly known as queenfish and leatherjacks. It is a moderately large fish growing to , although some less reliable sources state a maximum length of . The maximum published weight of . It has an elongate, moderately deep and slightly compressed body, with the dorsal profile slightly more convex than the ventral profile. The upper jaw is broad and rounded at its end with a single row of large, widely spaced canines in both the upper and lower jaw. The dorsal fin is in two parts; the first consisting of 6 or 7 short, often unconnected spines while the second dorsal fin consists of a single spine followed by 26 to 28 sof rays. The anal fin is similar in appearance to the second dorsal fin, having two detached spines followed by one spine attached to 23 to 25 soft rays. Both the ventral and pectoral fins are short, with the ventral consisting of one spine followed by 5 soft rays and the pectoral having 17 rays. The caudal fin is large and highly forked having 30 rays in total. The body is covered in small ctenoid scales except for part of the chest area which is naked. The species has no scutes. The vadigo has 24 vertebrae in total, and has 4 to 6 upper gill rakers and 9 to 12 lower rakers. The vadigo has a steel blue to green upper body extending to midway down its side where the darker colour terminates in a series of zig-zagging lobes, with the ventral colour being silver to white. All fins are hyaline to grey with the exception of the caudal fin which is often yellowish. Distribution and habitat The vadigo inhabits the eastern Atlantic Ocean only, distributed from The British Isles in the north to Senegal in the south, with the species also found around distant offshore islands including Madeira and the Canary Islands. The species is also common in the western Mediterranean Sea, where it has recently been found to extend as far north as the Adriatic Sea. The authors who reported this northern capture believe this shows an expansion of the vadigo's range, comparing it to a number of other carangid species who have recently been found outside of their normal range. The adults of the species are pelagic or epibenthic, inhabiting mostly shallow waters between 15 and 30 m in depth. It moves to more coastal waters during the summer in the Mediterranean. Biology and fishery The vadigo is a predatory fish, which takes smaller species of schooling fish as its primary prey. Little is known of its reproduction and growth, with only a single juvenile described in scientific literature. The eggs of the species are known to be pelagic and occur in a single seasonal peak each year, suggesting the species has a single spawning event annually. The species is of minor importance to commercial fisheries throughout its range, often taken by bottom and pelagic trawls. It is typically sold fresh, frozen or dried and salted and is also used for production of fishmeal and oil. It is considered to be a good table fish. Vadigo are occasionally caught by recreational fishermen, and are considered to be a fine sports fish. They may be caught on fish baits or lures, and are most abundant in the Mediterranean between July and September.

In the 16th century, the monastery was the centre of the Mljet Congregation (Congregatio Melitensem or Melitanam), gathering all the monasteries of Benedictine monks in the area of the Republic of Dubrovnik, and Vetranoviƒá was the first president of the Congregation. He wrote prolifically throughout his life, leaving a large body of work including prose, drama, religious and satirical poetry and an unfinished epic running to 4374 verses.

David Strouse, Samuel M. Brown, Richard O'Brian and David H. Bates, all from the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, were sent to Washington, D.C. to serve in the newly created office. In October of that year, Anson Stager was appointed department head. During the war, they were charged with maintaining communications between the federal government in Washington and the commanding officers of the far-flung units of the Union Army. Telegraph facilities prior to the Civil War Before the outbreak of the Civil War, there were three major telegraph companies in operation. These companies were the American Telegraph Company, the Western Union Telegraph Company, and the Southwestern Telegraph Company.William Rattle Plum, The Military Telegraph During the Civil War in the United States, ed. Christopher H. Sterling(New York: Arno Press, 1974),vol.1:63. The American Telegraph Company's lines occupied the entire region east of the Hudson River and ran all along the Atlantic coast down to the Gulf of Mexico. Cities were connected from Newfoundland to New Orleans. From this main backbone, the American Telegraph Company's lines branched west to cities like Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and Cincinnati.Plum, vol. 1:63. At each of these points, the American Telegraph Company's lines met the Western Union lines which occupied much of the remaining northern portion of the U.S. Western Union also extended a line as far west as San Francisco by 1861. In the southern states, the American Telegraph Company's lines met the Southwestern Telegraph Company's lines at Chattanooga, Mobile, and New Orleans. From these cities, the Southwestern Telegraph Company's lines occupied the rest of the South and Southwest, including Texas and Arkansas.Plum, vol.1:63. Formation of Military Telegraph Corps Not long after the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861 President Abraham Lincoln ordered seventy-five thousand troops to assemble in Washington, D.C. On April 19, 1861, Harpers Ferry, Virginia (which was along the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad) was captured by Confederate troops. Thus, Washington lost one of its only railroad and telegraphic communications route to the North. The only railroad and telegraph lines connecting the Northern states to Washington left were located in Maryland, a state whose loyalty to the Union was not trusted.Plum, vol.1:63-64. Thomas A. Scott became Assistant Secretary of War in 1861 and helped establish the U.S. Military Telegraph CorpsDue to the dire situation of the railroads and telegraphic communication in Washington,the commercial telegraph lines surrounding the city were seized and Secretary of War Simon Cameron sent a request to the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad to send Thomas A. Scott to get the railroad telegraph service in Washington under control.David Homer Bates, Lincoln in the Telegraph Office: Recollections of the United States Military Telegraph Corps during the Civil War(New York: D. Appleton-Century Company Inc., 1907), 20; Plum, vol.1:68 Scott made his way to Washington and began filling positions to help him manage the railroads and telegraph lines. He asked Andrew Carnegie, who was superintendent of the Pittsburgh division of the Pennsylvania Railroad to assist him. Carnegie obliged and drafted men from his railroad division to accompany him to Washington in order to help the government take possession of and operate the railroads around the capital.Bates, 20-21. Carnegie's first task when he arrived in Washington was to extend the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad from its old depot in Washington across the Potomac River into Virginia. While extending the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, telegraph lines were built and communication was opened at stations such as Alexandria, Burke's Station, and Fairfax.Bates, 22 & 25. The first government telegraph line built connected the War Office with the Navy Yard.Plum, vol.1:68. Carnegie stayed in Washington until November 1861. By the time he left, the military railroad and telegraph operations were running smoothly.Bates, 25. David Homer Bates was one of the original four operators of the U.S. Military Telegraph Corps. The other three were Samuel M. Brown, David Strouse and Richard O'Brien. Along with the appointment of Carnegie, Colonel Scott made a demand for telegraph operators who excelled at running trains by telegraph. Colonel Scott called on four telegraph operators from the Pennsylvania Railroad to report to Washington. These operators were David Strouse (who later became the superintendent of the Military Telegraph Corps), D.H. Bates, Samuel M. Brown, and Richard O'Brien.Plum, vol.1:67. The four operators arrived in Washington on April 27, 1861. Strouse and Bates were stationed at the War Department; Brown was stationed in the Navy Yard; and O'Brien was stationed at the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad depot, which was for some time army headquarters. Thus, these four men made up the initial United States Military Telegraph Corps, which would ultimately grow to a force of over 1500 men. Special status of the corps Although the U.S. Military Telegraph Corps played a prominent role in transmitting messages to and from commanders in the battlefield, it functioned independently from military control. As mentioned above, the U.S. Military Telegraph Corps employed civilian operators out on the battlefield and in the War Department. Only supervisory personnel were granted military commissions from the Quartermaster Department in order to distribute funds and property.Rebecca Robins Raines, Getting the Message Through: A Branch History of the U.S. Army Signal Corps(Washington D.C.: Center of Military History, 1996), 16-17. All of the orders the telegraph operators received came directly from the Secretary of War.Bates, 27. Also, because there was no government telegraph organization before the Civil War, there was no appropriation of funds by Congress to pay for the expenses of erecting poles, running cables, or the salaries of operators. As a result, the first six months that the U.S. Military Telegraph Corps was in operation Edward S. Sanford, president of the American Telegraph Company, paid for all these expenses.Bates, 36. He was later reimbursed by Congress for his generosity. Construction of telegraph lines  Men and equipment of the U.S. Military Telegraph Construction Corps, Brandy Station, Va., February 1864. The Telegraph Construction Corps were charged with the dangerous job of building telegraph lines in the field during battles. Consisting of about one hundred fifty men, the Telegraph Construction Corps set out in wagon trains to construct temporary lines.A.W. Greely, \\"The Military-Telegraph Service,\\" Signal Corps Association, http://www.civilwarsignals.org/pages/tele/telegreely/telegreely.html; Raines, 17. During a battle, one wagon was stationed at the starting point of the battle to act as a receiving station, while another wagon traveled into the field to be a sending station.Raines, 18. Thus, the orders could be sent back and forth between general headquarters and the battlefield, and what occurred during the battles could be sent back to the Military Telegraph Office in Washington, D.C. Initially these telegraph lines were only constructed for temporary use because of the brittle exposed copper wire that was used. But, after insulated wire began to be used, permanent lines were built. The Telegraph Construction Corps would load a coil of this wire on a mule's back and lead it straight forward to unreel the wire. As the mule moved forward unwinding the wire, two men followed and hung the line on fences and bushes so that it would not be run over until it was propped up with pikes.Eric Ethier, \\"The Operators,\\" Civil War Times 45, no.10 (January 2007): 17-18. Because these lines were so vulnerable to Confederate wire tapping and cutting, cavalry patrols kept guard of the wires when they were being built in an area lacking in Union soldiers.A.W. Greely, \\"The Military Telegraph Service.\\" Over the course of the war, the Telegraph Construction Corps built a total of 15,389 miles of field, land, and submarine telegraph lines.Raines, 22. Operators Vicksburg, June 1865. Serving as a U.S. Military Telegraph Corps operators, whether in the field or in the War Office was a hard and thankless job. The operators that served on the battlefield had the more dangerous job of the two. They encountered the constant threat of being captured, shot, or killed by Confederate troops whether they were establishing communications on the battle front, sending messages behind during a retreat, or venturing out to repair a line. Telegraph operators faced a casualty rate of ten percent, a rate similar to the infantry men they served with.Ethier, 18. Added to these dangers was the strenuous relationship the operators had with the military commanders they served under. Many of the commanders resented the Military Telegraph Corps operators because they were not members of the military, but employees of the Quartermasters Department. As a result, these commanders felt that the operators were not fit to serve with them and ultimately distrusted these men. Although the job of an operator in the War Office was not as dangerous, it was still a demanding job. The operators had to be quick and intelligent when receiving messages. Important messages were sent using cipher codes.Bates, 48. The cipher-operators had the major responsibility of decoding these viable pieces of information and moving the information along to higher-ranking officials or President Lincoln, who frequently visited the Military Telegraph office in the War Department building.Bates, 3. Along with decoding Union telegrams, the cipher-operators also had to decode Confederate ciphers. By decoding the Confederate cipher codes, plots such as setting fire to major hotels in New York City were averted. The U.S. Military Telegraph Corps operators served courageously during the Civil War. But, because these men were not members of the military, they did not receive recognition or a pension for their services, even though the supervisory personnel did because of the military commissions they received. As a result, the families of those men killed in action had to depend on charity to continue on. The operators of the U.S. Military Telegraph Corps were not recognized for their service until 1897, when President Cleveland approved an act directing the Secretary of War to issue certificates of honorable service to all members (including those who died) of the U.S. Military Telegraph Corps. But, this certificate of recognition did not include the pension these men passionately sought. Disbanding Plaque commemorating members of the U.S. Military Telegraph Corps from Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Once the Civil War was over the task of reconstructing the Confederate telegraph lines began. The U.S. government required that all of the major communication lines were to be repaired and controlled by the U.S. Military Telegraph Corps.William Rattle Plum, The Military Telegraph During the Civil War in the United States, (New York: Arno Press,1974), vol.2:341. Due to the lack of funds, the Confederate telegraph lines were in bad shape when the war ended and the operators of the U.S. Military Telegraph Corps faced a mountain of work. But these men rose to the challenge and on February 27, 1865 an order by the Quartermaster General transferred the Union control of telegraph lines in the South to commercial telegraph companies under the supervision of U.S. Military Telegraph Corps Assistant Superintendents .Plum, vol.2:347. Furthermore, this order relinquished control of all lines seized by the government in the North and sold the lines constructed by the U.S. Military Telegraph Corps to private telegraph companies.Plum, vol.2:348. Once control of the telegraph lines were turned over to the telegraph companies, the operators were discharged one by one. The only office that remained was the original telegraph office in the War Department.Plum, vol.2:346.

As a performer in the adult film industry, she was known professionally as Roxy. After she left the sex industry, Lubben became a born-again Christian and anti-pornography activist. From 2008 to 2016, she was the Executive Director of the Pink Cross Foundation, which reaches out to women and men in pornography and speaks in public forums, sharing about the hazardous working conditions that she experienced in the porn industry. In January 2016, she closed the Pink Cross Foundation. She was also an ordained Chaplain with the Order of Saint Martin with a degree in Theological studies.  Early life  Lubben was born on May 18, 1968 in Pasadena, California. In an interview with Howard Stern and Deseret News, Lubben stated that when she was nine years old, her brother and sister sexually abused her. Lubben worked as a prostitute from age 18 to 26. During this time, she became pregnant by one of her customers, and later gave birth to a daughter.  Career  = Adult industry = Lubben entered the adult film industry, while working as a prostitute, when she was 24 years old. During her time in the sex industry, she contracted herpes and HPV, which led to cervical cancer, and resulted in the removal of half her cervix. During and after her life in the sex industry, she battled alcohol and drug addictions. During her pornographic career, which lasted from 1993‚Äì1994, Lubben appeared in about 15 hardcore movies. Lubben stated that the sex acts that women perform on film sets are physically harmful (including anal and uterine hemorrhaging), and psychologically traumatizing. = Advocacy = In 2005, Lubben initiated an aggressive online marketing campaign, utilizing social networking web sites in order to reach out to the sex industry. In 2008, Lubben established a faith-based organization called the Pink Cross Foundation. The group concentrated on outreach to and evangelism of those in the porn industry, especially performers, and offers support to those wishing to leave the industry. The organization solicited donations online and offered an online support forum for individuals that are addicted to drugs, sex, and pornography. When Lubben identified interested individuals, she sent care packages filled with religious literature, bibles, Christian music, local grocery and department store gift cards, and other spiritual and practical supports. A secondary focus of Pink Cross was outreach to individuals seeking recovery from pornography addiction. Pink Cross attended pornography conventions to educate fans about how porn is not glamorous and also reaching out to porn stars and reminding them that they have options. The Pink Cross Foundation also lobbied against pornography and the adult entertainment industry. Lubben supported California legislator Charles Calderon in his effort to tax the pornographic industry by speaking to lawmakers about her experiences. Lubben indicated that the scenes on the set of a hardcore porn film often involve a woman and several men who are doing degrading acts to the woman. Lubben described the scene of a hardcore porn film as devoid of intimacy, and described it as \\"all mechanical and beastly\\". She further wrote that \\"women are vomiting off the set, and most of the actors are doing drugs and alcohol.\\" In June 2010, she spoke to U.S. House and Senate members and their staffs in Washington DC about the damage that was done to her body from her time in the porn industry. Moreover Lubben was outspoken regarding the illegal and hazardous working conditions in the industry, with sexually transmitted diseases being a workplace safety issue and public health concern. , Lubben was presenting her personal experiences in the adult film industry in public forums and speaking out about her recovery process and the emotional, mental, and physical effects of pornography on performers. In February 2011, she spoke at Cambridge University, where she presented on the harmful effects of pornography and debated the issue with advocates speaking on behalf of the pornography industry. In January 2013, Swiss recording artist and model Patrick Nuo publicly claimed that Lubben helped him deal with his pornography addiction. In January 2016, the Pink Cross Foundation shut down. = Media appearances = Lubben appeared in various international media outlets, including radio, television, and film. An overview of her life has been featured in the documentaries Traffic Control and Out of the Darkness, the latter of which was selected to be the opening film for the John Paul II Film Festival in 2011. Lubben was also in the 2012 documentary After Porn Ends, which is about life after being in the porn industry. In February 2011, she became the subject of a documentary entitled, The Devil and Shelley Lubben, created by porn industry advocate Michael Whiteacre. According to Mark Kernes of the adult industry trade journal AVN, the film disputes Lubben's experiences in pornography and the trauma she says can be traced to those experiences. In June 2012, Lubben shared her life story in Slovakia to local media outlets. = Recording background = In January 2011, Lubben released a rap/hip hop album with the proceeds going to the Pink Cross Foundation to help women and men recover from porn. The first single, titled \\"Killer Fantasy\\", features the message of a porn star speaking to the porn fan about the truth behind the adult industry.  Death  Lubben died on February 9, 2019, in Springville, California at the age of 50. No cause was given.  Published work  * Lubben, Shelley.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) injected into a bituminous coal bed would occupy pore space and also adsorb onto the carbon in the coal at approximately twice the rate of methane (CH4), allowing for potential enhanced gas recovery. This technique may be used in conjunction with carbon capture and storage in mitigation of global warming where the carbon dioxide that is sequestered is captured from the output of fossil fuel power plants. A research project at ETH Zurich is studying the process of pumping carbon dioxide into unminable coal seams and recovering the methane that is subsequently displaced. An extensive experimental investigation about the process of desorbing methane by adsorbing carbon dioxide in real coal samples was performed. The proof of principle and the technical feasibility of the method could be verified with these measurements. These research results indicate that CBM can become an alternative to conventional natural gas. ECBM provides additional to CBM the advantage of long-term CO2 storage in the underground coal seams. However, without other incentives, enhanced coal bed methane recovery is not economical as the commercial value of the released methane does not completely offset the cost of pumping. Penetration of CO2 into coal is simulated using a stress- enhanced diffusion model.F. J. Vermolen, M.G. Gharasoo, P. L. J. Zitha, J. Bruining. (2009).

They lacked the flared bowl of the Berkemeyer and had much thinner walls. The hollow base was built up by coiling strands of molten glass around a conical core. R√∂mers were quite distinct from the Berkemeyers, but both types evolved from the German \\"cabbage stalk\\" glasses which were cylindrical with prunts. R√∂mers are usually green in colour and with Berkemeyers were sometimes engraved with images and inscriptions.

Ancient Rhenish graves have yielded gilt-decorated bowls and beakers which were made using the fondo d'oro (\\"base of gold\\") process in which the design is etched into a layer of gold on the glass surface, and then covered by more glass. These techniques persisted to the fifth century, mythical and biblical themes enjoying great popularity. Out of this era grew that hallmark of German glass, the prunt, a design feature which is still found fifteen centuries later.German glass The word Roemer was anglicised and became \\"rummer\\" and English variants were widely produced from the late 18th century and throughout the 19th.

In 1844 hall was completed for meetings and was inaugurated, and it served as the headquarters for the Congress. Convinced of the need for open spaces for the various cultural expressions, Carlos Antonio L√≥pez order converts Theatre in this space, what happens in 1855, Congress being moved to the new Cabildo. That same year, the president of the Republic, Don Carlos Antonio L√≥pez, instructed the Spanish journalist and playwright, Ildefonso Antonio Bermejo, opening a theater in Asuncion, and the building of the First National Congress, which was opened on November 4, 1855. Subsequently Ildefonso A. Bermejo charted plans and built the building, which once completed construction would be the seat of Theatre. In 1886: Catalan businessman Baudillo Ali√≥ won the award of the old coliseum and the land of freedom to lift the square where a new National Theatre and then began the construction of the \\"National Theatre\\", which culminated in 1889. The inauguration took place on July 21, 1889] with the introduction of the Company Orchestra, La Estudiantina Espa√±ola Figaro, with repertoire of Verdi, Schubert, Flotow and others. In 1894: La obra de Ali√≥, an extension of the theater Bermejo, remained in the hands of society, were introduced boxes and beautiful courtyards with gardens, the billboard shows went renewing and life of the first coliseum of Assumption drew attention of friends and strangers. The scenario is reserved for major domestic and foreign companies. In 1939 it was transferred to the domain of the Municipality of Asuncion, becoming municipal theater. For the chamber of \\"Primer Coliseo\\" of Asuncion, became renowned foreign companies and national opera, operetta, zarzuela and theater. The Municipal Theatre, this symbolic space was closed in 1995 because of advanced deterioration and even the collapse of certain sectors. In June 1997 in collaboration with the Spanish Cooperation Agency and School of Asuncion started the restoration work. Restoration projects = Back to the life of an invaluable cultural heritage = The restoration of the Municipal Theatre undertaken by the municipal administration progressing according to the new reformulated project that the first call to tender, after the investigations and subsequent archaeological finds. The historic building and the draft defined that three bodies were formally identified and functional: the building of access, including large drum octagonal plate and block the scenes that is almost a building height. The new idea respects this adds to the overall design and two new elements: a block of services and lateral connections and a large roof over the courtyard north. In the functional structure is from the new entrances on the street Alberdi, closing it for vehicular use, creating a small square linked to the Theatre and Mail. This proposal does not close the old access, but proposes greater fluidity in the relationship inside-outside. Interior Considering the three parties listed, intervention in the building of access is limited to recover the original plant, eliminating subsequent additions, to install a new system of bypasses and services and increase capacity in the access original. The drum presents the same general picture, with a correction from levels in the boxes and a new slope in the stalls to improve visibility. The body of the scene is modified in response to international standards of mouth scenario, depth and noise. The north courtyard, new component of the project, will be used as a multipurpose hall, integrating the idea of recovering the fragments of the old building of Congress. It is proposed to maintain the texture without altering the overall volume of the whole. The new members formal follow the same patterns and proportions with language neutral synthetic The first work There have been passed many years since its inauguration until in June 1997 and with the collaboration of the Spanish Cooperation Agency and the School - Workshop Asunci√≥n, began the project through a design competition. Building data Planners remodeling: Carpelletti, Corval√°n, Esp√≠nola Assoc. In the view of the winners of preliminary convened in 1995, Corvalan and Capelletti, the architectural value of the Municipal Theatre is relatively modest, so that before considering what the restoration would rather talk of an intervention to practice in the building. The idea worked for the winners opted to integrate the existing old items with a contemporary approach, with particular emphasis on the privileged position it occupies the building in the heart of the historic center.

It is a prominent, near-perfect circular arc, covering more than 160¬∞ of a 450-km-diameter circle.Beals, C.S., 1968. On the possibility of a catastrophic origin for the great arc of eastern Hudson Bay. In: Beals, C.S. (Ed.), pp. 985-999. Science, History and Hudson Bay, Vol. 2, Department of Energy Mines and Resources, Ottawa.  Geology  The bedrock that comprises the shoreline and landscape that lies inland of the Nastapoka arc largely consists of Archean age rocks of the Superior craton. In areal distribution, these rocks consist of about 60% Archean granitic plutons and granitic gneiss. The granitic rocks include typically foliated granodiorites, quartz diorites, quartz monzonites, granites; related intrusive rocks; and their metamorphosed equivalents. Less common in occurrence are layered gneisses, migmatites and hybrid rocks that often form easterly trending linear belts.Martini, I.P., 1986. Canadian Inland Seas, Elsevier oceanography series, Vol. 44, Elsevier Science, 494 pp. About 20% of the Superior craton consists of metamorphosed Archean volcanic and sedimentary rocks. They occur as tightly folded, lightly metamorphosed (greenschist) preserved in easterly trending, elongate to irregular, structural basins known as greenstone belts. The most abundant volcanic rock is metamorphosed basalts that exhibit primary structures, e.g. pillow lavas, indicative of underwater volcanic eruptions. The metamorphosed sedimentary strata consist largely of interbedded mudstones and sandstones exhibiting sedimentary structures indicative of turbidites. A large triangular area surrounding Richmond Gulf, which includes a short segment of the Nastapoka arc, is underlain by about of undeformed, pink and red, mainly fluvial, feldspar-rich sandstone that is interbedded with minor beds of conglomerate and basaltic, subaerial, lava flows. These strata, which are known as the Richmond Gulf Group, rest unconformably on Archean crystalline rocks of the Superior craton and are now preserved by downfaulting only within the Richmond Gulf Graben. The graben, its faults, and the Richmond Gulf Group are unconformably overlain by the strata of the Nastapoka Group.Chandler, F.W. and Schwarz, E.J., 1980. Tectonics of the Richmond Gulf area, northern Quebec-a hypothesis. Current research, part C. Geological Survey of Canada, Paper, pp. 59-68.Chandler, F.W. and Parrish, R.R., 1989. Age of the Richmond Gulf Group and implications for rifting in the Trans-Hudson Orogen, Canada. Precambrian Research, 44(3-4), pp. 277-288. The portion of Hudson Bay immediately offshore of and partially encircled by the Nastapoka arc is underlain by Early Proterozoic strata of the Nastapoka Group. Adjacent to the Nastapoka arc, these strata form a homocline that dips gently westward and consist of unmetamorphosed to slightly metamorphosed sandstone, stromatolite- bearing dolomite, banded iron formation, and basalt. Further west, exposed in the Ottawa and Belcher Islands, the strata of the Nastapoka Group become highly faulted and tightly, often isoclinally, folded. These strata unconformably overlie Archean strata of the Superior craton and Proterozoic Richmond Group. The unconformity between the Early Proterozoic Nastapoka Group and the underlying Archean Superior craton lies just inland of Nastapoka arc as defined by the edge of arcuate eastern coastline of Hudson Bay. The unconformity consists of undeformed stromatolite-bearing dolomites overlying either foliated Archean granodiorite or the tilted and eroded strata of the Richmond Gulf Group. A thin, conglomeratic quartz sandstone separates the dolomites from the underlying strata and forms the base of the Nastapoka Group.Ciesielski, A., 1983, G√©ologie d'une portion sud de l'arc Nastapoka, Baie D'hudson, Quebec. Geological Survey of Canada, Open File no. 896. Scale 1:250,000  Origin  The origin of the Nastapoka arc has been a source of disagreement and discussion among geologists, other Earth scientists, and planetary geologists. Noting the paucity of impact structures on Earth in relation to the Moon and Mars and remarkable curvature of the shoreline of this part of Hudson Bay, Beals proposes that the Nastapoka arc is possibly part of a Precambrian extraterrestrial meteor impact structure that is comparable in size to the Mare Crisium on the Moon. In the same volume, WilsonWilson, J.T., 1968. Comparison of the Hudson Bay arc with some other features. In: Beals, C.S. (Ed.), pp. 1015‚Äì1033. Science, History and Hudson Bay, Vol. 2. Department of Energy Mines and Resources, Ottawa. evaluates Beals' interpretation and proposes an alternative hypothesis that the Nastapoka arc formed as the result of a continental-scale collision of pre- existing Archean continents and closure of an ancient ocean basin. In August 1972, Robert S. Dietz and J. Paul BarringerDietz, R.S., and Barringer, J.P., 1973. Hudson Bay Arc as an Astrobleme: a Negative Search. Meteoritics. 8(1), pp. 28‚Äì29. conducted an extensive search of much of the Nastapoka arc with First Nations and Inuit canoes and fishing boats in an investigation of its impact origin. They examined the abundant and extensive rock exposures that occur within the region of the Nastapoka arc and found a complete lack of shatter cones, suevite-type or other unusual melt rocks, pseudotachylite or mylonite, radial faults or fractures, unusual injection breccias, or any other evidence of shock metamorphism. Based on numerical modelling, regional geology, and lack of evidence for a hypervelocity impact, the current, general consensus is that it is an arcuate boundary of tectonic origin between the Belcher Fold Belt and crystalline rocks of the Superior craton created during the Trans-Hudson orogeny about 2.0‚Äì1.8 billion years ago.Hynes, A., 1991.

Theatre World and Screen World are the oldest definitive pictorial and statistical records of each American theatrical and foreign and domestic film season, and are referenced daily by industry professionals, students, and historians worldwide. =Theatre World= Theatre World, founded in 1945, covers the complete statistical and photographic Broadway, Off-Broadway, Off-Off- Broadway, and regional theatre seasons, major theatrical awards, obituaries, and the longest Broadway and Off-Broadway runs, among other categories. Ben Hodges is the current editor of Theatre World. Theatre World Awards From 1945 until the early 2000s, Mr. Willis presided over the annual Theatre World Awards. The awards hold the distinction of being the first to recognize Outstanding Debut in a Broadway or Off-Broadway Role; the first honorees were Barbara Bel Geddes and Marlon Brando. Over the years, Mr. Willis regularly oversaw and attended the ceremonies, and personally presented the Debut Award to such diverse talents as Warren Beatty, Jennifer Holliday, and John Leguizamo. As such, Willis has long provided encouragement to newcomers in a challenging industry. As the Theatre World Award is often the very first professional award for most honorees, the New York theatre community holds it in high regard. Willis was instrumental in the establishment of TWA's nonprofit status in 1997. The awards are currently chosen by a committee of New York Drama Critics and hosted by Peter Filichia. =Screen World= Screen World, founded in 1949, documents, maintains statistics and includes photographs from almost every film produced and/or released in the United States. It includes obituaries, Academy Award nominees and winners.

He fought on the Royalist side for King Charles during the English Civil War. Weston was the son of Ralph Weston of Rugeley, Staffordshire and his wife Ann Smith. He was educated at Exeter College, Oxford and was then called to the Bar by Inner Temple in 1607, becoming a bencher in 1626. Weston became Member of Parliament (MP) for Lichfield in 1614 and was re-elected in 1622. He was appointed judge on the Welsh circuit in 1632 and became serjeant at law in 1632/33. He became puisne Baron of the Exchequer in 1634 and was knighted in 1635. He built Hagley House in Rugeley. Weston was impeached in 1641 for his arguments in favour of ship money.State Trials (iii 1065) He was not tried, but joined the army of King Charles with his eldest son Richard in August 1642. In September 1643, Weston was at Shrewsbury with his brother Simon, a draper who supplied considerable quantities of clothing to the King's forces. He received a summons from the King to Oxford on 30 September.National Archives Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent Archive Service, Staffordshire Record Office - Landor Family D(W)1885/4/6/5 1643 By vote of the House of Commons, Sir Richard was disabled from acting as judge on 24 October 1645. He was at Oxford when the garrison surrendered in 1646, and he received a Safe-Conduct from Thomas Fairfax and signed by him. Weston married Ann Barbour, daughter of Richard Barbour of Helderston Staffs. He died at Rugeley and was buried on 4 March 1658.Rugeley Parish Register (The DNB entry may be confusing his date of death with his son or another Richard Weston) Weston's son Richard was also an MP, who in April 1640 was elected MP for Stafford for the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Stafford in November 1640 for the Long Parliament. He was a Royalist soldier and fled to the Isle of Man after the defeat at Oxford with Ralph Sneyd and James Rugeley where they were welcomed by the King and were believed to be present when Lord Derby responded to Oliver Cromwell's terms. The younger Richard Weston was taken prisoner at Colchester in July 1648 and was killed in the King's service in the Isle of Man in 1652.

This facility can provide a mechanism for security and privacy management by logical or physical separation of DNS information for network-internal access (within an administrative domain, e.g., company) and access from an unsecure, public network (e.g. the Internet). Implementation of split-horizon DNS can be accomplished with hardware-based separation or by software solutions. Hardware-based implementations run distinct DNS server devices for the desired access granularity within the networks involved. Software solutions use either multiple DNS server processes on the same hardware or special server software with the built-in capability of discriminating access to DNS zone records. The latter is a common feature of many server software implementations of the DNS protocol (cf. Comparison of DNS server software) and is sometimes the implied meaning of the term split-horizon DNS, since all other forms of implementation can be achieved with any DNS server software.  Rationale  Split-horizon DNS can provide a mechanism for security and privacy management by logical or physical separation of DNS information for network-internal access (within an administrative domain, e.g., company) and access from an unsecure, public network (e.g. the Internet). One common use case for split-horizon DNS is when a server has both a private IP address on a local area network (not reachable from most of the Internet) and a public address, i.e. an address reachable across the Internet in general. By using split-horizon DNS the same name can lead to either the private IP address or the public one, depending on which client sends the query. This allows for critical local client machines to access a server directly through the local network, without the need to pass through a router. Passing through fewer network devices improves the network latency. As an example, the DNS server could be configured to return two different sets of records for the host host1.example.net for requestees internal and external to a corporate network. The internal response could look like: @ IN SOA ns.example.net admin.example.net. ( 2010010101 ; serial 1D ; refresh 1H ; retry 1W ; expire 3H ) ; minimum @ IN NS ns ns IN A 203.0.113.2 host1 IN A 10.0.0.10 While the external response would be: @ IN SOA ns.example.net admin.example.net. ( 2010010101 ; serial 1D ; refresh 1H ; retry 1W ; expire 3H ) ; minimum @ IN NS ns ns IN A 203.0.113.2 host1 IN A 203.0.113.10  Interaction with DNSSEC  Split-horizon DNS is designed to provide different authoritative answers to an identical query and DNSSEC is used to ensure veracity of data returned by the Domain Name System. These apparently conflicting goals create the potential for confusion or false security alerts in poorly constructed networks. Research has produced recommendations to properly combine these two DNS features.Split-View DNSSEC Operational Practices  Implementations  Implementation of split-horizon DNS can be accomplished with hardware-based separation or by software solutions. Hardware-based implementations run distinct DNS server devices for the desired access granularity within the networks involved. Software solutions use either multiple DNS server processes on the same hardware or special server software with the built-in capability of discriminating access to DNS zone records.

He was the son of Dr. John Wesley Lewis and Catherine Ann Battle.Inventory of the William Gaston Lewis Papers, Manuscripts Department, UNC Library His first cousin Anna Lewis married Captain Luther Rice Mills, who later became a college Professor at Wake Forest University.http://www.thebattlebook.com/BattleBookOnline/TheBattleBook_Chapter13_GenealogyTableBook61-Book75.pdf He was educated at Lovejoy's Academy in Raleigh. Soon after the death of his father, the family moved to Chapel Hill, where Lewis entered the University of North Carolina, studying civil engineering. Lewis graduated in 1855. He then taught in Chapel Hill for a year, before moving to Florida. In 1857, he was appointed to the U. S. Survey Corps, and worked in Minnesota for over a year. He then returned to North Carolina and became assistant engineer on the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad.William Gaston Lewis Civil War When the Civil War began, Lewis joined the Confederate army as the third lieutenant of Company A, 1st North Carolina Regiment (\\"Bethel\\"). His first fighting came in the Battle of Big Bethel on June 10, 1861. By January 1862, he had been promoted to major and took part in the Battle of New Bern. For his actions at New Bern, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 33rd North Carolina Infantry. Lewis fought with the regiment at the Seven Days Battle and the Battle of Malvern Hill. During the later months of 1862, he took part in the defense of Richmond. Lewis returned to North Carolina in December 1862 and took part in the fighting in and around New Bern and Kinston. In the spring of 1863, his regiment returned to Virginia and he took part in the Gettysburg Campaign with the 43rd North Carolina Infantry as part of Brigadier General Junius Daniel's Brigade of Major General Robert Rodes' Division. At Gettysburg, the regimental commander, Colonel Thomas S. Kenan, was wounded and captured, and Lewis took command of the regiment. After the Confederate retreat from Gettysburg, Lewis returned to North Carolina and took positions around New Bern. He subsequently took part in the fighting to recapture Plymouth. He led Robert Hoke's brigade at the Battle of Cold Harbor and was promoted to brigadier general following the battle in June 1864. He was then wounded during Jubal Early's raid on Washington. In 1864, he married Martha Luncinda \\"Mittie\\" Pender, first cousin of Major General Dorsey Pender. Lewis also supervised the entrenchment of Drewry's Bluff, Virginia. He took part in a skirmish near Farmville, Virginia, on April 7, 1865, but was once again wounded and captured during the fighting. He was paroled within two weeks. Throughout his military service in the Confederate Army, Lewis saw action in thirty-seven battles and skirmishes. Postwar career Following the war, Lewis returned to his peacetime career as a civil engineer, serving as the State Engineer of North Carolina for thirteen years, plus many years as road- master, construction engineer, chief engineer, and general superintendent for several railroads. In 1899, he was chief engineer for the Albany and Raleigh Railroad. Lewis died on January 7, 1901, from pneumonia. Ancestry Through his paternal Grandmother Ann Harrison, he is descended from early immigrant Captain James Neale and his wife Anne Gill, who was a Lady-in-Waiting to Queen Henrietta Maria (the wife of King Charles I of England).

The Cumberland Turn junction with the Regent's Canal is still visible with the short stub-end of the arm remaining housing the Feng Shang Floating Restaurant. In the 1880s, American writer Ellis Martin was touring the London canals, but chose not to enter the basin as an 1850s report described it as \\"no better than a stagnant putrid ditch\\", and noted that cholera had spread amongst nearby neighbourhoods and boat-dwellers.

He was the author of more than a dozen books and thirty articles on widely varied subjects on American intellectual history. Early life and education Diggins was born in San Francisco in 1935 to Anne Naughton and a gardener for the city, John Diggins Sr., both of whom were Irish immigrants. Raised in a Catholic household, he attended Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory. Diggins received a bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1957; a master's from San Francisco State College; and a doctorate in 1964 at the University of Southern California. He was an assistant professor at San Francisco State College from 1963 to 1969; an associate professor and then professor at the University of California, Irvine; and, from 1990, a Distinguished Professor at the CUNY Graduate Center.Grimes, William. \\"John P. Diggins, 73, Historian, Dies\\", The New York Times, January 29, 2009. Accessed January 30, 2009.  Career  Diggins taught history at San Francisco State University until 1969, when he took up an offer at UC Irvine. There, he served as an associate professor. In 1972, Diggins began at City University of New York Graduate Center (CUNY), where he stayed for two decades, until taking over as acting director of the Graduate Center from 1996 to 1997. Diggins held for a time the chair in American Civilization at the √âcole des hautes √©tudes, Paris, and was a visiting professor at Cambridge and Princeton Universities. Additionally, Diggins was a consultant and frequent lecturer at University of London and Columbia University. Aside from teaching, Diggins wrote dozens of books and articles, starting with Mussolini and Fascism in which Diggins describes the popularity of the Italian leader prior to World War II. Diggins then took newly formed ideas of the American left to publish The Rise and Fall of the American Left and Up from Communism, which proposed that leftist ideals grew worldwide through a series of eruptions and events through history and were later exported to other countries, giving birth to movements such as Marxism. Diggins was also critical of the New Left and even tougher on the academic left, which that followed. He derided the trendy ideas of Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida. Up from Communism describes four prominent liberal doctrinaires who flipped ideologies by embracing conservatism. Diggins continued to write articles and other books on intellectual history for the next 30 years. In his best-seller Ronald Reagan: Fate, Freedom, and the Making of History, Diggins asserted that Reagan was treated dismissively and that his virtues were indeed liberal. That was contrary to Diggins's personal experience of Reagan \\"standing for tear gas and police\\" most likely in reference of the 1960s Berkeley protests. Diggins said that his view on Reagan changed after he had read his writings that were released after Reagan's death. Diggins concluded that Reagan was \\"far from conservative\\" and more on the liberal side of the spectrum. Instead of the previous notions about him, Diggins wrote, \\"Reagan was the great liberating spirit of modern American history, a political romantic impatient with the status quo.\\" Diggins topped off with Why Niebuhr Now? describing the shifting political loyalties of Reinhold Niebuhr; written posthumously, the book was released in 2011. An obituary reported that Diggins \\"was \\"critical of the anticapitalist Left for seeing in the abolition of property an end to oppression\\" but also \\"critical of the antigovernment Right for seeing in the elimination of political authority the end of tyranny and the restoration of liberty.\\"Mattson, Kevin. \\"Man in the Middle: John Patrick Diggins\\" , Dissent Magazine, February 12, 2009. He stated, \\"I am left of right and right of left.\\" Diggins was a consultant on various films and documentaries, including \\"Between the Wars;\\" \\"Reds;\\" \\"John Dos Passos;\\" \\"The Greenwich Village Rebellion\\"; \\" Emma Goldman;\\" \\"The New York Intellectuals;\\" \\"The Future of the American Left;\\" and \\"Il Duce, Fascismo e American\\" (Italian television). Diggins also appeared in numerous interviews with C-SPAN. His Mussolini and Fascism: The View from America won him the 1972 John H. Dunning Prize. He earned a fellowship award from the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1975, became a resident scholar of the Rockefeller Foundation in 1989, and was nominated for the National book Award for History.  Personal life  Diggins's three marriages ended in divorce. As a California native, he lived in Laguna Beach, California, for years while he taught at UC Irvine. Later, Diggins lived in the Upper West Side. He died on January 28, 2009, in Manhattan after a battle with Colorectal cancer. He is survived by his companion of 15 years, the author Elizabeth Harlan; a son and a daughter, both from his first marriage; two sisters; and two grandchildren. Diggins's interests ranged from the foundations of the United States to the postmodern world. He declared Ronald Reagan to be \\"one of the two or three truly great presidents in history.\\" Diggins was a critically acclaimed member of the American Historical Association, American Studies Association, and American Philosophical Society After Diggins's death, the John Patrick Diggins '53 Endowed Scholarship was created in his name at Sacred Heart Prep in San Francisco  Criticism  In a review of Diggins's Ronald Reagan: Fate, Freedom, and the Making of History Rich Lowry, editor of the National Review wrote, > Diggins seems blinded by Reagan's sunniness, which, in this interpretation, > was not just a matter of temperament, but reflective of a deep philosophical > and religious conviction. Reagan, Diggins maintains, sought to rid \\"America > of a God of judgment and punishment.\\" This is absurd. Reagan had a > charitable view of human nature and a relaxed, nonjudgmental air, but there > is no denying his deeply felt social conservatism.

Lady Katherine Grey  Portrait of Lady Katherine Grey Sir Owen Hopton's kindly treatment of Lady Katherine Grey, when she was by command of Queen Elizabeth, 2 October 1567, kept prisoner at Cockfield Hall during the last months of her life, probably won him the trust afterwards reposed in him by that often untrusting sovereign. After two years in the Tower of London (where as Countess of Hertford she bore two sons), Lady Katherine had since August 1563 been successively in the custody of Sir John Grey of Pirgo (her uncle),See correspondence, H. Ellis, Original Letters Illustrative of English History, 2nd Series, 4 vols (1827), II, pp. 272-88 (Internet Archive).

Hopton wrote to Secretary Cecil on 11 January advising him that she was dangerously ill. Suffering from consumption, she died on 27 January 1567/68. Sir Owen was at her deathbed and received from her three rings to deliver to her husband, and a supplication for mercy towards her husband and children, which she bound him to deliver in person to Her Majesty.\\"The manner of her departing\\", from Harleian MS 39 fol. 380, is printed at length in Ellis, Original Letters, 2nd Series, vol II, pp. 288-90 (Internet Archive). At Her Majesty's command, Hopton arranged a suitable heraldic funeral for her in the Cockfield chapel of Yoxford church: the expenses for her journey, her board and her funeral (¬£140) and for the Herald's charges and costs (¬£79) were refunded to Sir Owen from the royal coffers. Meals and lodgings were provided for 77 mourners.W.L.

Lieutenant of the Tower  Hopton owed his position at the Tower of London (which he was found to discharge efficiently) to the \\"good meanes and favour\\" of William Cecil (who became Lord Burghley in 1571), and received a salary of ¬£200 per annum. He was in charge of the most significant prisoners of the age, including particularly the Duke of Norfolk and his associates. His written request survives, to the Earl of Leicester and Lord Burghley of 2 June 1572, for directions as to the beheaded Duke's burial (\\"whose dead corse remayneth in the church here, unburyed\\"), and there in the church of St Peter ad Vincula the Duke's grave was made.R. Lemon, Calendar of State Papers, Domestic, of the Reigns of Edward VI, Mary and Elizabeth, 1547-1580 (Longman, Brown, Green, Longman and Roberts, London 1856), p. 445 (Google). Hopton supervised the conduct of examinations of prisoners, and served and advised the Privy Council directly.See, for example, the examinations of May 1575: 139-151, Doctor Attslowe, Watkyn Davies, John Jackson, Nevill Sandes and Dr James Good. 'Elizabeth: May 1575', in W.K. Boyd (ed.), Calendar of State Papers, Scotland, Vol. 5: 1574-81 (HMSO, London 1907), pp. 134-54 (British History Online). By his role he was fully complicit in the Elizabethan anti-Catholic persecutions.E.g. B. Camm, Lives of the English Martyrs (Longmans, Green and Co., London); B.A. Harrison, A Tudor Journal: The Diary of a Priest in the Tower, 1580-1585 (St Paul's, 2000). He figures preeminently in 1581 in the confinement, interrogations and torture of Edmund Campion (whom he at first confined in \\"Little Ease\\"), eager to help his masters to win the political prize of Campion's conversion and proposing strategies to achieve it, yet lacking the imagination to realize that coercion, menaces and inducements would only strengthen Campion's purpose and resolve.R. Simpson, Edmund Campion, A Biography, New Edition (John Hodges, London 1896), Chapter XII, pp. 324-356 (Internet Archive). When certain prisoners were to be tortured, he received instructions and could be relied upon to supervise the procedure or conduct it himself, according to his own discretion.See, for instance, B. Montagu, 'A Letter to the Right Honourable Thomas Babington Macaulay', The Monthly Review, New and improved series, vol. 3, for September-December 1841 (G.

As one of the high commissioners for causes ecclesiastical, in 1582 he was signatory to a directive from the Privy Council for public readings of Christopher Ocland's Anglorum Praelia.J. Ames, Typographical Antiquities: being an Historical Account of Printing in England (W. Faden/J. Robinson, London 1749), p. 314 (Internet Archive). During the 1580s he fell into controversy with the Lord Mayor and Citizenry of London by his refusal of their writs of Habeas Corpus issued against the officers and attendants of the Tower, disputing with the City the jurisdiction of the \\"Queen's Verge\\".F.

A. Mundy), A Survey of London (Elizabeth Purslow/Nicholas Bourne, London 1633), p. 379 (Google). Robert is thought to have resigned his position in 1577. He also controlled the armoury. In 1583-1584 his daughter Cicely, being apparently in love with the recusant John Stonard, carried \\"letters and credit of importance\\" between prisoners in the Tower and the Marshalsea Prison. It was observed, \\"Much could be learnt from her examination of the plans of [George] Throckmarton and [Jervais] Pierpoint\\".R.

By Indenture of 1585, with Owen Tasburgh (his wife's kinsman), he levied a fine on his manors of Blythburgh, Westwood, Walberswick, Hinton, Westhall and Thorington, with appurtenant lands also in Westleton, Darsham, Wenhaston and elsewhere, granting seisin thereof to Edmund Hall and William Roberts, for the sole use and benefit of his son and heir Arthur Hopton of Charterhouse, Somerset.The National Archives (UK), Court of Wards and Liveries, Indenture ref.

Sir Owen was remembered favourably by the people of Walberswick in later times, when the Brooke family deprived them of their rights over the common and at Paulsfen. At two hearings, in 1642 and 1654, before judges Littleton and Phesant, Suffolk voices were raised to recall the more liberal behaviour of the Hoptons: > \\"...they would speak of the Previlidge they had in Sir Owen Hopton's Dayes, > who was Lord of the Mannor before the Brookes cam to it...\\" (the witnesses) > \\"spoake boldly to the judge Fessant, and tould him, that in Sir Owen > Hopton's Dayes they had nooe such Dooinge, for he was a worthie Jentleman, > and loved the poore Towne, and joyed the Previlidge they had by ther Common; > and Robert Dourant, who was the Townes Neattards Boy in Sir Owen Hopton's > dayes, have often sayd, that Sir Owen him selfe have com downe from his > West-Wood-Lodge to Paules-Fenn, and had him com up to the Lodge and drynke, > so that it was otherwise in those Days, than have been since.\\"T.

He was also a former chairman of the Philippine Sports Commission. Early life and education Mel Lopez was born in Manila on September 1, 1935 to Carmen Campos of Bulacan and Lt. Col. Gemiliano L√≥pez Sr. of Manila. He is also the grandson of Honorio Lopez, writer and revolutionary during the Spanish Revolution. He graduated from the Jose Rizal University (formerly Jose Rizal College) with a degree in Bachelor of Science in Commercial Science. He also played swimming, boxing and basketball in the NCAA for the JRU Heavy Bombers. Personal life He was married to Concepcion Tantoco, a Filipina businesswoman and entrepreneur. They were married for over fifty years and have nine children, over thirty grandchildren, and two great- grandchildren. Political life = Councilor (1967‚Äì1975) = On August 21, 1971, 1971 Plaza Miranda bombing marred a Liberal Party rally, killing 9 persons and injuring 92 more, including Lopez, who was then a councilor. President Ferdinand Marcos used the bombing incident as a basis to suspend the writ of habeas corpus. When Marcos declared martial law, Lopez decided to organize active opposition to the regime that could eventually topple it and help restore democracy to the country. He held secret meetings with labor and student leaders, community and political leaders, exploring ideas on how to organize opposition to the martial law regime. =Laban= Lopez was among the founding signatories of Laban, a contraction of ‚ÄúLakas ng Bayan‚Äù and a Tagalog translation of People's Power. When Marcos announced an election for the Interim Batasang Pambansa on April 7, 1978, he was the campaign manager in Manila, organizing sorties and meetings to attract more citizens to oppose Marcos' dictatorial rule. = Batasang Pambansa (1984‚Äì1986) = In recognition of his leadership in Manila, some 20 prospective candidates of United Nationalists Democratic Organizations (UNIDO) for the 1984 Batasang Pambansa elections signed a resolution giving him authority to select the five other candidates for the six assembly seats assigned to Manila based on voting population. Marcos' ticket, the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan, suffered a heavy blow and the UNIDO candidates including Lopez and four others won. While serving in the Batasang Pambansa, he filed bills aimed at proposing the compensation income of spouses who are both employees to be taxed separately, paying lower taxes, seeking to abolish the Metro Manila Commission, providing for the establishment of the Philippine National Language Commission, and providing for a synchronization of national and local elections in 1986. = Mayor of Manila (1986‚Äì1992) = After the People Power Revolution, Lopez was appointed as Mayor of Manila. During his early years, his administration was faced with 700 million pesos worth of debt and inherited an empty treasury. In the first eleven months, however, the debt was reduced to 365 million pesos and the city's income rose by around 70%. Revenues from movie theaters rose by 180%, from public markets 170%, and the Manila Zoo began to have profits. Manila had an annual income of over 700 million pesos due to these increase in tax revenues. Within the same eleven months, 21 schools were built. Squatters were relocated, with an average of 12,700 families a year. During the 1988 elections, he ran for a full term under the PDP-LABAN and won, defeating Former Assemblyman Lito Atienza and Former Senator Eva Estrada-Kalaw. Lopez closed down numerous illegal gambling joints and jueteng. He also blocked the re-opening of jai-alai, the ‚Äúgame of the thousand thrills,‚Äù despite pressure from powerful groups. In January 1990, Lopez padlocked two Manila casinos operated by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), saying the billions it gained cannot make up for the negative effects gambling inflicts upon the people, particularly the youth. As a result of this, he was charged with graft in the Sandiganbayan in the same year. The case remained unresolved until it was finally dropped in June 2002.Sandigan clears former Mayor Lopez He also worked for the revival of the Boys‚Äô Town Haven (now referred to as ‚ÄúBoys Town‚Äù), rehabilitating its facilities to accommodate underprivileged children and provide them with livelihood and education. During the 1992 elections, he lost reelection to former National Bureau of Investigation director Alfredo Lim.  Post-mayoralty (1992‚Äì2017)  In 1993, he was appointed by President Fidel Ramos as Chairman of the Philippine Sports Commission, serving until 1996. During his term as PSC Chairman, he helped Onyok Velasco to captured the silver medal in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, USA, together with his son Manny Lopez, then-president of the Amateur Boxing Association of the Philippines (renamed as Association of Boxing Alliances in the Philippines or ABAP), now the Congressman of 1st District of Manila. In 1995, he sought a rematch against Lim but was unsuccessful. Nine years later, in 2004, he ran again for mayor against then incumbent Lito Atienza under the Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino (KNP) but lost. Lopez died on New Year's Day, January 1, 2017, in Quezon City from a heart attack at the age of 81. In April 2019, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11280 to officially rename a portion of Radial Road 10 to Mel Lopez Boulevard, which runs from Anda Circle in Manila up north to Estero de Marala at the city's border with Navotas.

L. Blanchard (11 December 1820 ‚Äì 4 September 1889), was an English writer who is best known for his contributions to the Drury Lane pantomime. He began writing plays and other literature to support himself as a teenager after his father died. He soon became a prolific creator of dramas and eventually gained critical acclaim for his works. He also served as a newspaper drama critic and mentored other writers. Early life Edward Blanchard was born at 28 Great Queen Street, London, the second son of the actor William Blanchard. He was educated at Brixton, Ealing and Lichfield, and accompanied his father to New York in 1831. William died in 1835 when Edward was only 14 years old; Shortly afterwards, he dropped out of school and joined a travelling \\"oxyhydrogen microscope\\" exhibition, even giving the lectures to the public himself on occasions. However, it did not pay well and he was eventually left stranded in the west of England; fortunately he managed to borrow half a crown from a scene-painter he had met in Bristol, and walked back to London in 3 days. In London, he embarked on a literary career. He soon started writing plays, and had written over 30 of them by the time that he turned 20. His initial plays were written under the pen name Francisco Frost. He was paid only ¬£2 per play when he started writing, and wrote advertisements for businesses and comic songs for clowns to supplement his income. Blanchard began contributing to Renton Nicholson's The Town at the age of 17. He began contributing articles to the paper shortly after it was launched in 1837 and continued writing for them for the next two years. He later described the articles that he wrote there as \\"social essays and dramatic notices\\". One of the first articles that he wrote for the paper described underground gambling in Leicester Square. The articles The Town published on the gambling there were later credited with causing the London police to suppress the gambling there. Years later, after Nicholson's death, Blanchard defended Nicholson against some of his critics, contending that he was a kind and generous man who produced much \\"clever and utterly unobjectionable\\" work. Career In 1841 Blanchard was hired by the Olympic Theatre to write regularly for their plays. In 1845 a play that he wrote was staged at the Surrey Theatre for the first time. He also served as a writer and editor for several periodicals in the early 1840s, including Punch and The New London Magazine. He also edited a large work on William Shakespeare by Samuel Phelps. Blanchard's most successful position was writing the Drury Lane pantomimes. He contributed pantomimes for that theatre for 37 years. He was applauded for his skill in writing on a variety of different topics, including dramas, farces and burlesques. His work was often praised for good taste and moral themes, in addition to its imaginative qualities. In 1858 he began writing for The Daily Telegraph. He later became the paper's dramatic critic. In that role he served as a mentor to Clement Scott, who later became his successor. In 1859 Blanchard began writing for the Birmingham Daily Gazette, as well. Later life Blanchard lived in Adelphi Terrace from 1876 until 1889. He had four children and often struggled to support his family due to the limited income he received from his writing. His wife Caroline was active in Louisa Hubbard's Women's Emigration Society that helped indigent young women from London emigrate to Australia or Canada. He died on 4 September 1889 at Albert Mansions, Victoria Street, London, after a long illness described by the attending Doctor as \\"creeping paralysis\\". He was buried at Kensington Cemetery in Hanwell. In 1891 The Life and Reminiscences of E. L. Blanchard was published in two volumes. It was edited by Clement Scott and Cecil Howard and published by Hutchinson. The book has been described as \\"a memorial of arduous and incessant struggles and, until near the end, of miserable pay\\" and \\"a delightful picture of one of the kindest, most genial and lovable of Bohemians ‚Äì a man with some of the charm of Charles Lamb\\".

Coughlan joined the team during the 1891 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1899 championship. During that time he won two All- Ireland medals and two Munster medals. At club level Coughlan was an eight- time county club championship medalist with Blackrock. Playing career =Club= Coughlan played his club hurling with the Blackrock GAA club in Cork and enjoyed much success. He won his first senior county title in 1887 as ‚Äòthe Rockies‚Äô captured the very first Cork county title. Coughlan added further county titles to his collection in 1889 and 1891. Blackrock quickly became the standard-bearers in the county and Coughlan had further county victories with the club in 1893, 1894, 1895, 1897 and 1898. =Inter-county= Coughlan made his first appearance for the Cork senior hurling team during the 1891 championship, however, Cork's campaign ended without success. Two years later in 1893 Coughlan was back on the Cork team as part of the Blackrock contingent. Cork's opening game was a provincial decider against Limerick. A remarkable 5-3 to no score victory gave Coughlan his first Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final provided the very first championship meeting of Cork and Kilkenny. The game was fixed for Ashtown, however, upon arrival both teams refused to play there as somebody had neglected to cut the grass. After a long delay the goalposts were uprooted and both teams and their supporters headed to the Phoenix Park where the game took place after a long delay. The game itself turned into a rout as Cork scored 6-8 to Kilkenny‚Äôs 0-2. It was Coughlan‚Äôs first All-Ireland medal. Coughlan lined out in a second provincial decider in 1894. A 3-4 to 1-2 defeat of Tipperary gave him a second Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider saw Dublin provide the opposition. A delay of two hours mattered little to Cork and the team powered to a 5-20 to 2-0 victory. It was one of the most one-sided championship deciders of all- time while it also gave Coughlan his second All-Ireland medal. It was also Cork's third successive All-Ireland title. Four-in-a-row proved beyond Cork as a dispute over the awarding of the All-Ireland football title in 1894 resulted in Cork leaving the Gaelic Athletic Association in protest. Coughlan continued to line out with Cork without success until his retirement after the 1899 championship. Personal life Born in Blackrock, Coughlan was the eldest of what would become a hurling 'dynasty'. His young brothers, Denis, Jer, Dan and Tom, would all become All-Ireland medalists with Cork. Coughlan worked as a fisherman and was affectionately knows as Parson. He married Nora Dorney, sister of fellow Blackrock and Cork hurlers \\"Bill Bill\\" Dorney and \\"Down Down\\" Dorney. Coughlan‚Äôs sons, Eudie and John, went on to win seven All-Ireland medals between them with Cork between 1920 and 1931. His daughter, Kitty, won three All-Ireland medals in-a-row between 1939 and 1941 as a member of the Cork camogie team. Coughlan's grandson, Willie, continued the hurling tradition by winning a championship medal with Blackrock in 1961.

An ideal depolarizer would output randomly polarized light whatever its input, but all practical depolarizers produce pseudo-random output polarization. Optical systems are often sensitive to the polarization of light reaching them (for example grating-based spectrometers). Unwanted polarization of the input to such a system may cause errors in the system's output. Types =Cornu depolarizer= Cornu depolarizer The Cornu depolarizer was one of the earliest designs, named after its inventor Marie Alfred Cornu. It consists of a pair of 45¬∞ prisms of quartz crystal, optically contacted to form a cuboid. The fast axes are 90¬∞ apart and 45¬∞ from the sides of the depolarizer (see figure). Any ray entering the prism effectively passes through two wave plates. The thickness of these wave plates and therefore their retardance varies across the beam. The phase shift is given by :\\\\delta(y) = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\lambda}[n_2 - n_1](2y - a). For an input beam of uniform polarization the output polarization will be periodic in y. The phase shift is also dependent on wavelength due to dispersion. The use of two prisms means that the output is essentially coaxial with the input. At the interface between the prisms refraction does take place, as the refractive indices are exchanged. There is therefore some separation of the components of the output beam. This device is not commonly used today, but similar designs are commercially available. =Lyot depolarizer= Lyot depolarizer The Lyot depolarizer is another early design. It was invented by Bernard Lyot. It consists of two wave plates with their fast axes 45¬∞ apart, with the second plate twice thicker than the first. The output is periodic as a function of wavelength and as a function of the wave-plates' thickness. Special considerations are needed when this depolarizer is to be used for a particular application, because the optimal wave-plate thicknesses depend on the signal wavelength and optical spectrum with which it is to be used. It is commercially available for broadband visible applications. This device is especially attractive in fiber optics, where two pieces of correct length of polarization-maintaining optical fiber spliced together at a 45¬∞ angle are used instead of the wave-plates, thus no other components such as beam splitters are required. =Wedge depolarizer= Quartz-silica Quartz- silica wedge depolarizer The quartz-silica wedge depolarizer is a common commercial design and is similar to the Cornu depolarizer, however, the angle between the two components is much smaller (2¬∞ is typical) and only the first component is birefringent. The second component is made of fused silica, which has a very similar refractive index to quartz, but is not birefringent. The fast axis of the quartz element is generally at 45¬∞ to the wedge. The whole device is much more compact than a Cornu depolarizer (for the same aperture). As with the Cornu depolarizer, there is some separation of the output as a function of polarization, as well as some beam deviation due to the imperfect match in refractive index between quartz and silica. The output is periodic across the depolarizer. Because the wedge angle is so much smaller than in a Cornu depolarizer the period is larger, often around 6 mm. This depolarizer also has a preferred orientation because of its single defined fast axis. In commercial wedge depolarizers this is usually marked. Quartz-quartz Quartz-quartz wedge depolarizers are commercially available, though not common. They are similar to Cornu depolarizers, but with the small wedge angle of the silica-compensated wedge. Other birefringent materials can be used in place of quartz in the above designs. Wedge depolarizers exhibit some small beam deviation. This is true even if the faces of the optic are exactly parallel. Because each half of the optic is a wedge, and the two halves do not have exactly the same refractive index (for a particular polarization), the depolarizer is effectively very slightly wedged (optically). =Time-variable depolarizer= The Lyot depolarizer and similar devices are based on the fact that the retardations of optical waveplates or retarders depend on optical frequency or wavelength. They cause polarization mode dispersion which can be detrimental. Furthermore they cannot be used for (quasi-)monochromatic signals. For the latter, time-variable depolarizers are needed. These are composed of time-variable optical retarders. An effective way to realize time- variable depolarizers are rotating waveplates or equivalent optical devices. A rotating halfwave plate produces polarization which is periodic in time, and therefore effectively scrambled for sufficiently slow responses. Its input polarization must be linear. Resulting output polarization is rotating linear polarization. Likewise, circular polarization can be depolarized with a rotating quarterwave plate. Output polarization is again linear. If a halfwave and a quarterwave plate are concatenated and rotate at different speeds, any input polarization is depolarized. If the waveplates are not perfect, more rotating waveplates can improve performance\\"Accuracy Limits of Polarization- Independent Optical Depolarizers Based on Rotating Waveplates\\", Reinhold Noe, Benjamin Koch, 25 Jan. 2019, https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08838. Based on electrooptic rotating waveplates, such polarization-independent depolarizers are commercially available with depolarization intervals down to 360 ns (see external link). Other ways to produce depolarized light In many applications it is possible to use a quarter-wave plate to produce circularly polarized light, but this is only possible for light of a limited range of wavelengths which is linearly polarized to start with. Other methods have been demonstrated, such as the use of Faraday rotators and liquid crystals. It is also possible to depolarize light using fiber optics.

In 1941, against his will, Kopfermann was named dean of the University by the rector, which pressured Kopfermann into joining the (NSDAP, National Socialist Workers Party). He remained at Kiel until 1942.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Kopfermann. While at the University of Kiel, Kopfermann was a principal participant in an event organized by Wolfgang Finkelnburg. The event, known as the (‚ÄúMunich Synod‚Äù), signaled the decline of the influence of the (German physics) movement. The movement was anti-Semitic and anti-theoretical physics. As applied in the university environment, political factors took priority over the historically applied concept of scholarly ability,Beyerchen, 1997, 141-167. even though its two most prominent supporters were the Nobel Laureates in Physics Philipp Lenard Beyerchen, 1977, 79-102. and Johannes Stark.Beyerchen, 1977, 103-140. When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933, the concept and movement took on more favor and more fervor. Supporters of launched vicious attacks against leading theoretical physicists, including Arnold Sommerfeld and Werner Heisenberg. It was in the summer of 1940 that Finkelnburg became an acting director of the (NSDDB, National Socialist German University Lecturers League) at the Hentschel, 1996, 290 and Appendix F (see the entry for Finkelnburg). (today, the ). As such, he organized the , which took place on 15 November 1940. The event was an offensive against the movement. Finkelnburg invited five representatives to make arguments for theoretical physics and academic decisions based on ability, rather than politics: Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker, Otto Scherzer, Georg Joos, Otto Heckmann, and Hans Kopfermann. Alfons B√ºhl, a supporter of , invited Harald Volkmann, Bruno Th√ºring, Wilhelm M√ºller, Rudolf Tomaschek, and Ludwig Wesch. The discussion was led by Gustav Borer, with Herbert Stuart and Johannes Malsch as observers.Document 110: The Fight against Party Politics by Wolfgang Finkelnburg printed in Hentschel, 1996, 339-345. Also see Beyerchen, 1977, 176-179. While the technical outcome of the event may have been thin, it was a political victory against and signaled the decline of the influence of the movement within the German Reich.Beyerchen, 1977, 176-179.In part, Finkelnburg‚Äôs role in organizing the influenced Carl Ramsauer, as president of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft, to select Finkelnburg in 1941 as his deputy. See Document 86: Letter to Ludwig Prandtl by Carl Ramsauer, 4 June 1944, in Hentschel, 1996, 267-268. In 1933, shortly after Adolf Hitler became Chancellor, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was passed, which resulted in resignations and emigrations of many physicists, one of them was James Franck, who was director of the (Second Physics Institute at the Georg-August University of G√∂ttingen). In 1935, an ordinance related to the Civil Services act, the Law on the Retirement and Transfer of Professors as a Result of the Reorganization of the German System of Higher Education, was used to forcibly transfer Georg Joos to G√∂ttingen to fill Frank's position as ordinarius professor and director of the Second Physics Institute. In 1942, Kopfermann was appointed as ordinarius professor on the chair for experimental physics, formerly held by Franck and then Joos. From the start, he worked on the German nuclear energy project, also known as the (Uranium Club). Additionally, he built a 6-MeV betatron, studied atomic beams, resonance, and the biological effects of radiation, and developed methods of optical interferometry.Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entries for Kopfermann and Joos.Mehra and Rechenberg, Volume 6, Part 1, 2000, 351n413. As a principal in the , Kopferman, with a couple of physicists under his direction, investigated and developed isotope separation techniques; their work included the construction of a mass spectrograph. The mass spectrograph was listed as one of twenty-five commissioned nuclear research projects granted between 1 April 1943 and 31 March 1944; the classified list accompanied a letter from Kurt Diebner, Reich Planning Officer, to the president of the (Reich Research Council) on 18 April 1944. Electromagnetic mass spectrometry was investigated for the separation of uranium isotopes.Walker, 1993, 52-53.Horst Kant Werner Heisenberg and the German Uranium Project / Otto Hahn and the Declarations of Mainau and G√∂ttingen, Preprint 203 (Max-Planck Institut f√ºr Wissenschaftsgeschichte, 2002), p. 19.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Kopfermann.Kurt Diebner Listing of Nuclear Research Commissions Enclosed with a Letter to the President of the Reich Research Council [April 18. 1944] in Document #104 in Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 322-324.

While there, he served on the council of CERN.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Kopfermann.Mehra and Rechenberg, Volume 6, Part 1, 2000, 351n413. During 1956 and 1957, Kopfermann was vice-chairman of the (Nuclear Physics Working Group) of the (Commission II ‚ÄúResearch and Growth‚Äù) of the (DAtK, German Atomic Energy Commission). Other members of the Nuclear Physics Working Group in both 1956 and 1957 were: Werner Heisenberg (chairman), Hans Kopfermann (vice- chairman), Fritz Bopp, Walther Bothe, Wolfgang Gentner, Otto Haxel, Willibald Jentschke, Heinz Maier-Leibnitz, Josef Mattauch, Wolfgang Riezler, Wilhelm Walcher, and Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker.

Membership is by invitation; in recent years membership includes women. Notable members of the club have included William Dean Howells, Henry Cabot Lodge, Henry James, and Charles Eliot Norton. In February, 1885, the club adopted the Totem of Bear, which continues today as mascot for the group. Frequent dinners, lectures, and musical and theatrical performances take place in the club for the members and their guests. In March 1885, Mark Twain attended a dinner in his honor, and another in 1901.

The congregation did not last long, however; it never had a settled pastor, and the elders died or moved away, causing the congregation to become disorganized on 18 November 1850. Some members remained, nevertheless: the present church building was erected in the town in Vernon in 1853, and Illinois Presbytery reorganized it as the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Vernon on 16 September 1856.

In August 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, Hurst enlisted as a private in the British Army and changed his name from Hans to Brian soon afterwards. He saw service with the 6th Battalion Royal Irish Rifles at the battle of Chunuk Bair in Gallipoli, the Balkans and the Middle East. At the battle of Chunuk Bair his regiment were \\"battle virgins when they were thrown into the Turkish machine gun fire for the first time on 10 August 1915\\".Malta Story (released 1953) - The Director's Cut page 16 by Allan Esler Smith, Treasures of Malta, number 48, Summer 2010, Vol. XVI No 3 published by Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti in association with the Malta Tourism Authority \\"They had set out a few hours before for the Chunuk Bair with twenty officers and over 700 men.

'Because an Englishman is worth twenty foreigners.' Why not against Ireland? 'Because an Irishman is worth fifty Englishmen.'\\" In the same article when commenting about his experiences of fighting at Gallipoli in a Battalion that was from a mixed religious background with recruiting offices in Belfast and Dublin, the article comments \\"Catholic-Protestant antagonism vanished in this holocaust\\".Wilfred De'ath, Punch, 8 October 1969, p.575, 576 Returning from World War I Hurst found life in Belfast constraining and he took a government grant to emigrate to Canada sometime in 1920. He enrolled at the Toronto College of Art. After two years he left and went to France to study art at √âcole des Beaux Arts in Paris. Early film career Hurst moved to Hollywood where he quickly rose from set artwork to film production. Under the guidance of John Ford, sometimes claimed to have been Hurst's cousin,Brian McFarlane (ed) The Encyclopedia of British Film, BFI/Methuen, 2003, p.329 Hurst learnt about set management. Hurst made a cameo appearance as an extra in Ford's Hangman's House (1928) where he briefly appearsJohn Hill \\"'Purely Sinn Fein Propaganda': the banning of Ourselves Alone\\", Historic Journal of Film, Radio and Television, University of Ulster, p.317, 327 alongside a young John Wayne. Hurst and Ford remained lifelong friends. Hurst was with Ford and helped advise him when he brought Hollywood to Ireland when making The Quiet Man (1952). By 1933 Hurst was ready to return to the UK and settled in Belgravia, where he lived from the 1930s to his death in 1986, although he often returned to Ulster to visit relatives for \\"a spiritual bath\\". Hurst's early Irish work is John Millington Synge's Riders to the Sea (1935) and the Irish War of Independence love story Ourselves Alone (1936). Irish Hearts (1934) \\"is certainly one of the main contenders for the first Irish sound feature film\\".Brian McIlroy \\"British Filmmaking in the 1930s and 1940: The Example of Brian Desmond Hurst\\", in Wheeler Winston Dixon (ed.)

Hurst's visuals are invariably compared with those of his mentor, John Ford and the opening shots of Riders... are markedly Fordian in their elementary quality\\".Ruth Barton Irish National Cinema, Routledge, 2004, p.52, 53 Ourselves Alone was banned in Northern Ireland at the time of its release in 1936 although it has now achieved the recognition it deserved and is shown in museums and other public access points in Northern Ireland. It appears to have been misunderstood. At the time Hurst pointed out the original story had been written by a British Army officer and Hurst claimed that the film was \\"pro-British\\". Hurst's earliest English films include The Tell-Tale Heart (1934), The Tenth Man (1936) and Glamorous Night (1937). In 1937 Hurst was retained by Alexander Korda to direct a film about T. E. Lawrence and he co-wrote a screenplay for it with Miles Malleson and Duncan Guthrie, but the project was obstructed by the British administration in Palestine before Hurst, himself an Arabic-speaker, could scout locations. On the Night of the Fire is regarded as one of the early examples of British film noir. Released in December 1939 at the outbreak of the Second World War and set in Newcastle upon Tyne, it charts the slow moral destruction of a barber following his theft of some money. The film critic David Quinlan describes the film as \\"grim but gripping\\". Andrew Spicer, in his book European Film Noir, writes: \\"A riveting psychological study. With its sustained doom- laden atmosphere, Krampf‚Äôs expressive cinematography, its adroit mixture of location shooting and Gothic compositions and Ralph Richardson‚Äôs wonderful performance as a lower middle class Everyman, On the Night of the Fire clearly shows that an achieved mastery of film noir existed in British cinema\\". Also in 1939, Hurst and Korda co-directed The Lion Has Wings (1939) featuring Ralph Richardson, fulfilling a promise Korda had made to Churchill. It was described by one critic as \\"Hurst's most celebrated film of the 1930s\\". Hurst went on to make four more propaganda films from 1940 to 1942 and continued to make films set in the Second World War until 1956. Later years The Times, in its obituary of Hurst in 1986, commented that Dangerous Moonlight (1941) was \\"his best known picture\\", \\"a big popular success\\" which \\"launched a cycle of pictures with concerti as their theme music\\"The Times, 2 October 1986 because of its successful utilisation of Richard Addinsell's Warsaw Concerto. Hurst worked for the Ministry of Information during the Second World War for whom his films included A Call for Arms (1940), Miss Grant Goes to the Door (1940) and his homeland film A Letter From Ulster (1943) where Hurst and Terence Young (as scriptwriter) and his fellow Ulsterman and Assistant Director William MacQuitty created a film \\"promoting a sense of community\\" between the people of Northern Ireland and over one hundred thousand troops from the America based in Northern Ireland at the time. Brian McIlroy explained that \\"Hurst was able to persuade one Catholic and one Protestant soldier to write letters home, explaining their impressions of their stay. From these letters, Terence Young, the scriptwriter, was able to construct a sequence of activities that revealed the different traditions of Ireland.\\" Hurst's The Hundred Pound Window (1944) sees a young Richard Attenborough in his first credited role. Hurst directed scenes in Caesar and Cleopatra (1945) where he provided Roger Moore with his first film role and then helped pay for Moore to attend RADA. For Theirs is the Glory (1946), Hurst took 200 members of the 1st Airborne back to Arnhem and Oosterbeek to direct and \\"remake\\" their role in the Battle of Arnhem. Every person in the film served with the 1st Airborne or was a civilian from Oosterbeek or Arnhem. Hurst said, \\"The film is my favourite because of the wonderful experience of working with soldiers and because it is a true documentary reconstruction of the event. I say without modesty it is one of the best war films ever made\\". The premiere of Theirs is the Glory was on the second anniversary of the battle in September 1946 and was attended by the Prime Minister. King George VI commanded a private screening at Balmoral Castle. Theirs is the Glory and A Bridge Too Far were compared in the battlefields magazine Against All Odds and the comparison is stark and revealing \\"A Bridge Too Far is a slow moving epic, well worth a viewing with some authentic scenes, but is unconvincing in its portrayal of the battle of Oosterbeek... Theirs is the Glory is the only feature film currently released that accurately portrays the events at Oosterbeek in atmospheric and chronological terms, despite its jerky portrayal of events. This is a film to watch.\\".Against the Odds. Heroic battles in the Face of Adversity. Author Robert Kershaw. Published 11 October 2010 Hurst's post-war career included producing and directing the Christmas film Scrooge (1951) which is the \\"best of the many screen versions of Dickens's warm-as-mince-pies A Christmas Carol, with Alastair Sim as Scrooge incarnate: his miserly humbuggery is a delight. So is Michael Hordern's ghostly Jacob Marley and the snowy, atmospheric photography of C.M. Pennington-Richards\\".Paul Howlett \\"Christmas and new year TV films\\", The Guardian, 18 December 2009 Hurst produced Tom Brown's Schooldays (1951) and directed the box office success Malta Story (1953) featuring Alec Guinness as an RAF pilot helping to defend Malta. \\"The combination of an A list cast, the portrayal of the iron reliance of the Maltese people, the gallantry of the RAF pilots and a tragic love story were the four components of its success\\".Malta Story (released 1953) - The Director's Cut page 15 by Allan Esler Smith, Treasures of Malta, number 48, Summer 2010, Vol. XVI No 3 published by Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti in association with the Malta Tourism Authority Hurst went on to direct Simba (1955) featuring Dirk Bogarde and Donald Sinden and The Black Tent (1956) featuring Donald Pleasence, Anthony Steel and Donald Sinden again. The Black Tent was based on a short story of the same title by Robin Maugham. Hurst's Behind the Mask (1958) sees a young Vanessa Redgrave obtaining her first credited role (alongside her father Michael Redgrave). Hurst's only excursion into farce was His and Hers (1961) and saw a strong cast of Terry Thomas joining the carry-on stalwarts Kenneth Williams, Joan Sims and Kenneth Connor supported by Oliver Reed. In 1962, in his late '60s, Hurst returned to John Millington Synge and adapted the script and produced and directed The Playboy of the Western World, his last film. Hurst gave early film roles to Richard Attenborough, Roger Moore and Vanessa Redgrave. The first four scriptwriting roles of later Bond director Terence Young were on the Hurst directed films On the Night of the Fire (1939), A Call For Arms (1940),Dangerous Moonlight (1941) and A Letter From Ulster (1942). They worked together again on the scripts of Theirs is the Glory (1946) and Hungry Hill (1947) and remained good friends.

The work's program is the same as that of the same composer's four Mephisto Waltzes, written respectively in 1859‚Äì60, 1880‚Äì81, 1882 and 1885 and based on the legend of Faust, not by Goethe but by Nikolaus Lenau (1802‚Äì50). The following program note, which Liszt took from Lenau, appears in the printed score of the Mephisto Waltz No. 1: > There is a wedding feast in progress in the village inn, with music, > dancing, carousing. Mephistopheles and Faust pass by, and Mephistopheles > induces Faust to enter and take part in the festivities. Mephistopheles > snatches the fiddle from the hands of a lethargic fiddler and draws from it > indescribably seductive and intoxicating strains. The amorous Faust whirls > about with a full-blooded village beauty in a wild dance; they waltz in mad > abandon out of the room, into the open, away into the woods. The sounds of > the fiddle grow softer and softer, and the nightengale warbles his love- > laden song.Quoted in Ewen, 519‚Äì20. The first recording of this piece was by France Clidat in her traversal of Liszt's works for Decca.Liner notes to the France Clidat recordings. Dedication The Mephisto Polka was dedicated to Lina Schmalhausen, one of Liszt's \\"inner-circle\\" piano students. However, she is remembered more as one among the closest and most ardently devoted of Liszt's followers, frequently attending to and assisting in the many needs of the aged master whose health was in rapid decline. Form This work appears the simplest and technically least challenging of all the Mephisto dances; except for the Bagatelle sans tonalit√©, it is also the shortest. Tonally, it is also mildest and can appear to be a fully tonal composition, with chromaticism limited to neighboring-tone and chordal sonority varieties. These passages are usually realized on the left hand in chordal or arpeggiated figures. However, the simplicity in notation disguises the true character of the music. There is no functional harmony to clearly create the relational behavior of tonic, dominant, and subdominant harmonic functions. If anything, the general impression of the music is modal, with the piece constantly in flux. Any suggested tonality is quickly undermined by the following sonority, which may in turn vaguely (and now even more weakly) suggest another tonal focus. The most haunting touch is at the end, when the piece simply stops without explanation.Walker, The Final Years, 442. with a solitary F natural above middle C sounding, then dying out.Howard, Dances, 4-5.

The active isomer is levcromakalim. It acts on ATP-sensitive potassium channels and so causes membrane hyperpolarization. It can be used to treat hypertension as it will relax vascular smooth muscle to lower blood pressure. Hyperpolarisation of smooth muscle cell membranes pulls their membrane potential away from the threshold, so making it more difficult to excite them and thereby cause relaxation. Synthesis Levcromakalim synthesis:Anon., Drugs Future 11, 175 (1986). racemate:J. M. Evans et al., ; eidem, (1983, 1984 both to Beecham). of isomers:E. Faruk, (1984 to Beecham). Reaction of 4-cyanophenol (4-Hydroxybenzonitrile) with 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-butyne under PTC probably proceeds to initial formation of a propargyl carbocation. The course of the reaction can be envisaged by assuming that this then attacks the aromatic ring; the resulting allylic cation can then capture the adjacent phenol oxygen and thus form the observed product (3). Treatment of that product with aqueous NBS leads to the addition of the elements of hypobromous acid and formation of the bromohydrin (4) as a mixture of the trans enantiomers. This cyclizes to the epoxide 5 in the presence of sodium hydroxide (5). Ring opening of the oxirane with ammonia gives a mixture of the trans amino alcohols (6). These are probably resolved at this stage and the 3S,4R-enantiomer used in the next stage. That isomer is next acylated with 4-Chlorobutyryl chloride to give the chloroamide (7). The anion from reaction of the amide with sodium hydride then displaces the chlorine on the end of the chain to form the pyrrolidine ring. There is thus obtained levcromakalim (8).

It was built between 1752 and 1760 by Denmark-Norway to defend the economic interests of the natural deep water port of Frederiksted and to ward off pirates. It has red and white painted walls, making it quite different then yellow and white of Fort Christiansv√¶rn on the other side of the island. It is located at the north end of Frederiksted, in St. Croix, south of the junction of Mahogany Road and VI 631. It should not be confused with Frederiks Fort, Fortberg Hill, on St. John, which is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. According to Westergaard, \\"It was soon found that a customs house was not sufficient, but that cannon must be provided, and placed as to command the roads where the ships lay anchored. In lack of such a 'water battery', ships were accustomed to slip away in the night-time without securing papers of paying their dues.\\" In 1776, the first salute from foreign soil to the new nation of the United States of America was fired from the fort. The salute of Old Glory which had been raised on an American brigantine at port in Frederiksted was a violation of the laws of Denmark-Norway's neutrality however the islands had helped the British colonist in America sealing a friendliness between the two colonies, and the salute was therefore appropriate. It is from this fort that Danish Governor-General Peter von Scholten emancipated the slaves on 3 July 1848. John Gottliff (also known as Moses Gotlieb, General Bordeaux, or Buddhoe) had led 8,000 blacks in a freedom march to Frederiksted. At the time, there were 17,000 slaves and 5,000 free blacks on St. Croix. The fort includes a museum and art gallery, it is open weekdays from 8:30am to 4pm, and Saturdays from 1pm to 4pm. Admission is $3 (2015). Fort Frederik was listed as a contributing property in the Frederiksted Historic District in 1976. It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. It was further declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997. Fort Frederik now stands guard over the Eliza James-McBean Clock Tower and Emancipation Park, a town park right in front of the Frederiksted fort and waterfront. The park contains statues of historically important Virgin Islanders. Small paths weave through dozens of large mahogany trees and fragrant flowers. This Federiksted park honors the slave revolt leader General Buddhoe and also serves to recall and honor the 1848 proclamation by Governor Peter von Scholten that emancipated slaves in the Danish islands. The park has many benches and a small gazebo and is the location for Jazz in the Park, every 3rd Friday of the month (2014).

Description  The rifle is capable of engaging infantry at a distance of up to 1800 meters and can combat material targets at ranges up to 2500 meters. As an effective anti-sniper weapon, OSV-96 keeps the shooter outside of the effective range of conventional calibers providing a distinct advantage over lower caliber rifles. Specialized high-accuracy 12.7√ó108mm 7N34 59.0 gram FMJ and AP sniper cartridges have been developed for Russian .50-caliber sniper rifles such as this rifle. Large caliber machine gun cartridges can also be used for firing, but with limited accuracy. The OSV-96 folds in half in between the barrel/chamber and receiver compartments to shorten its length for ease of transportation. The rifle features a free-floating barrel in combination with a large muzzle brake to greatly decrease its recoil.

History Hospital founded by the London Jews Society, Jerusalem The society began in the early 19th century, when leading evangelical Anglicans, including members of the influential Clapham Sect such as William Wilberforce, and Charles Simeon, desired to promote Christianity among the Jews. In 1809 they formed the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews. The missionary Joseph Frey is often credited with the instigation of the break with the London Missionary Society. A later missionary was C.W.H. Pauli. Abbreviated forms such as the London Jews' Society or simply The Jews' Society were adopted for general use. The original agenda of the society was:For the Love of Zion, Kelvin Crombie, Hodder & Stoughton Religious, 1991, , p. 3 * Declaring the Messiahship of Jesus to the Jew first and also to the non-Jew * Endeavouring to teach the Church its Jewish roots * Encouraging the physical restoration of the Jewish people to Eretz Israel - the Land of Israel * Encouraging the Hebrew Christian/Messianic Jewish movement The society's work began among the poor Jewish immigrants in the East End of London and soon spread to Europe, South America, Africa and Palestine. In 1811, a five-acre field on the Cambridge Road in Bethnal Green, east London, was leased as a centre for missionary operations. A school, training college and a church called the Episcopal Jews' Chapel were built here. The complex was named Palestine Place. In 1813, a Hebrew-Christian congregation called Benei Abraham (Children of Abraham) started meeting at the chapel in Palestine Place. This was the first recorded assembly of Jewish believers in Jesus and the forerunner of today's Messianic Jewish congregations. The London Jews Society was the first such society to work on a global basis. In 1836, two missionaries were sent to Jerusalem: Dr. Albert Gerstmann, a physician, and Melville Bergheim, a pharmacist, who opened a clinic that provided free medical services. By 1844, it had become a 24-bed hospital. In its heyday, the society had over 250 missionaries. It supported the creation of the post of Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem in 1841, and the first incumbent was one of its workers, Michael Solomon Alexander.Crombie, Kelvin (2006) A Jewish Bishop in Jerusalem: the life story of Michael Solomon Alexander. Jerusalem: Nicholayson's The society was active in the establishment of Christ Church, Jerusalem, the oldest Protestant church in the Middle East, completed in 1849. In 1863, the society purchased property outside the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem. In 1897, they opened a hospital on the site, designed by architect Arthur Beresford Pite. Today, the building houses the Anglican International School Jerusalem, which is operated by the society. Beit Bussel. Safed. Built by the London Society in 1904 as a Mission Hospital, later purchased by the JNF and used as Yiftach Brigade headquarters during the 1948 war. In 1914, the society was described as In response to changing attitudes towards outreach and the Jewish people, the society has changed its name several times over the years, first to Church Missions to Jews, then The Church's Mission to the Jews, followed by The Church's Ministry Among the Jews, and finally to the current name of The Church's Ministry Among Jewish People, which was adopted in 1995. The society's historic archives are stored by the Bodleian Library in Oxford. A history of the society was published in 1991.For the Love of Zion, Kelvin Crombie, Hodder & Stoughton Religious, 4 September 1991, Current activities The organisation is one of the ten official mission agencies of the Church of England. It currently has branches in the United Kingdom, Israel, Ireland, France, the USA, Canada, South Africa, Hong Kong and Australia. The organisation marked its bicentenary in 2009 with four special church services around the United Kingdom. Current issues The missionary focus of CMJ attracts criticism from the Jewish community who regard such activities as highly detrimental to Jewish-Christian relations. For example, Rabbi Shmuel Arkush of Operation Judaism, a Jewish organisation dedicated to opposing missionaries, has called for CMJ to be disbanded. In 1992, George Carey became the first Archbishop of Canterbury in 150 years to decline to be the Patron of CMJ, a decision that was praised by Jewish leaders and reported as the front-page headline in The Jewish Chronicle. Subsequent reports confirmed that the Archbishop, the most senior figure in the Anglican Church, did not wish to endorse the organisation's missionary work, which he felt was damaging to interfaith relations. In addition, CMJ has often adopted a Zionist position, and expressed the view that the Jewish people deserved a state in the Holy Land decades before Zionism began as a movement, in accordance with the Restorationism of its founders. It supported the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 and continues to engage in pro-Israel advocacy. This has drawn criticism from opponents such as Stephen Sizer. A detailed response to Sizer's criticisms was produced by the then General Director of CMJ, Tony Higton. A further source of tension has been the unusual situation whereby the Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem did not receive jurisdiction over Christ Church, Jerusalem once St. George's Cathedral, Jerusalem was constructed in 1899. Many of the bishops have not shared CMJ's convictions or their desire to take the gospel to the Jewish community, but Christ Church belongs to CMJ, which has always had the status of an independent Anglican society, and consequently the bishops do not have control over the church or its activities. Through all the opposition, CMJ continues its pro-Israel advocacy.

An androgen ester prodrug of drostanolone, drostanolone propionate, was formerly used in the treatment of breast cancer in women under brand names such as Drolban, Masteril, and Masteron. This ester has also been used non-medically for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Like other AAS, drostanolone is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR). It is not a substrate for 5Œ±-reductase and is a poor substrate for 3Œ±-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3Œ±-HSD), and therefore shows a high ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity. As a DHT derivative, drostanolone is not a substrate for aromatase and hence cannot be aromatized into estrogenic metabolites. While no data are available on the progestogenic activity of drostanolone, it is thought to have low or no such activity similarly to other DHT derivatives. Since the drug is not 17Œ±-alkylated, it is not known to cause hepatotoxicity. Chemistry Drostanolone, also known as 2Œ±-methyl-5Œ±-dihydrotestosterone (2Œ±-methyl-DHT) or as 2Œ±-methyl-5Œ±-androstan-17Œ≤-ol-3-one, is a synthetic androstane steroid and a derivative of DHT. It is specifically DHT with a methyl group at the C2Œ± position. History Drostanolone and its ester drostanolone propionate were first described in 1959.

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. The entire Hauterive area is part of the Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites. History The land for the abbey was donated between 1132-1137 by Baron Guillaume de Gl√¢ne (died in 1143, his grave is in the church). After monks moved down from Cherlieu Abbey in northern Burgundy and inhabited the buildings, the Bishop of Lausanne granted permission to consecrate the abbey in 1137. It was then consecrated on 25 February 1138 as the sancte Abbatia Marie de Altaripa. Pope Innocent II confirmed this consecration in 1142. With support from the local nobility and the Bishop of Lausanne, the abbey flourished both economically and culturally in the 12th and early 13th centuries. In 1157 the Dukes of Z√§hringen granted the abbey their protection and exemption from tolls. The abbey quickly became tied to the city of Fribourg when they began raising sheep for wool to sell to the city. After 1182, citizens of Fribourg had the right to be buried at the abbey. The Chartular of Hauterive (or \\"Liber donationum\\") as well as confirmation bull of Innocent III in 1198 and Innocent IV in 1247 all give evidence of a prosperous abbey with extensive landholdings. The abbey was supported by nine villages, in the alpine foothills (dairy industry), the Swiss plateau (agriculture) and Lake Geneva (wine). The construction of canals in the 12th century, allowed the abbey to build several grain mills and a fulling mill. In 1445 a paper mill was built as well. From the mid-12th century until the 14th there was a significant scriptorium and library at the abbey. The library suffered a number of losses through looting and fires, especially the fire of 1578. In 1185, the monks from Hauterive founded Kappel Abbey in Kappel am Albis in the Canton of Zurich. In 1261, the La Maigrauge nunnery near Fribourg was placed under the authority of Hauterive. At the end of the 12th century and the early 13th century, the monastery was home to 30-40 monks and about 50 conversi or lay brothers. During this time, the abbey's estates were managed by the lay brothers. In the 14th century, the number of lay brothers decreased and the abbey was forced to lease out the farms. Under Abbot Peter Rych (1320‚Äì28) the cloister was decorated with tracery windows and the gothic church choir was decorated with six tracery and stained glass windows. Under Abbot Jean Philibert (1472‚Äì88) the extensive late gothic choir stalls were added. In 1418 Pope Martin V, during his trip through Switzerland to the Council of Constance, granted abbot Peter Affry (1404‚Äì49) and his successors the pontifical vestments. During the Sempach war (1386‚Äì87), the abbey supported Fribourg and was plundered. During the 1448 war between Bern and Fribourg, the abbey was pillaged by Bernese troops. The damage to the abbey and its lands along with internal conflicts brought about a decline of the abbey. Around the middle of the 16th century, Fribourg embraced the reforms of the Council of Trent. The city set out to reform and revitalize neighboring monasteries. They enacted reforming provisions in 1562, and appointed an administrator to enact these reforms in the monasteries in 1566. In 1579, the papal nuncio Giovanni Francesco Bonomi visited Hauterive. The reform-minded abbot Mo√´nnat Guillaume (1616‚Äì40), reorganized the nunneries of La Maigrauge and La Fille-Dieu in Romont. In 1618, Hauterive became a member of the Upper-Germanies Cistercian Congregation. The baroque reconstruction of the convent building began in 1715 under Abbot Henri de Fivaz (1715‚Äì42) and was completed in 1770 under Bernhard Emmanuel of Lenzburg (1761‚Äì95). These second flourishing of the abbey stopped in 1798 when they had to pay a war indemnity, after the French invasion, and lost the right to self-rule. In 1811 there were ten priests and six brothers at the abbey, while in 1847, there were 16 priests and two brothers. The abbey and its lands were secularized in 1848 after the Sonderbund war. The archive and library, including the largest collection of medieval manuscripts in western Switzerland were transferred to Fribourg. The building became an agricultural school in 1850. In 1859 it became the district teacher's college. It was settled by monks from Wettingen- Mehrerau Abbey in 1939 and became an abbey again in 1973. As of 2003, there were eight priests and 16 brothers at the abbey. The buildings and lands, which are farmed by the monks, are held by a foundation. The monks other main activity is the housing and care of guests.

It was directed by Christopher Leitch and stars Charlie Sheen, Leslie Caron, Juliette Caton and Jan Rube≈°. The film is set during the outbreak of World War I with Heidi as a teenager, despite the fact that the original novel (in which Heidi is 5) was first published in 1881. Plot In 1915, during World War I, Heidi, now fifteen years old, still lives on the Swiss Alps with her grandfather. She receives an invitation from Madame Jane Hillary, the headmistress of Brookings School for Girls in Italy, to join her school. Heidi has the means to go, as she has just received an inheritance from her friend Klara's grandmother. Grandfather wants Heidi to make the most of the opportunity so she will be able to take care of herself when he is gone. Though initially reluctant, when she learns that her sweetheart Peter has joined the army, she accepts the invitation. Heidi is at first unable to adapt to modern life at the school, often clashing with her more sophisticated classmate Ursula. Heidi's only friend is Ilsa who often stands up for Heidi whenever she is bullied by Ursula and her snobby cohorts, though she has the kind support of Madame Hillary who like her originally came from a more modest background. Italian troops arrive at the school with a letter from the Governor and commandeer the building for use as a military post. All the girls are fetched by their families except for four: Heidi, Ursula, Ilsa and Gudrun. Hillary is happy to care for the four girls, but the unscrupulous owner of the town orphanage, Signor Bonelli, claims the girls. Hillary is forced to give them up as Bonelli has the support of the Governor. The four girls find that the orphanage is a run-down and cruel place that uses forced labor. Heidi wants to escape, but Ursula insists that Madame Hillary will come for them. Hillary's attempt is blocked by Bonelli. Heidi eventually learns through another orphan, Clarissa that they can escape through the drain. The four Brookings girls, Clarissa, and another orphan named Giovanni escape and hitch a ride on a cart for the countryside. Signor Bonelli chases after them and catches Giovanni. The five girls escape through the forest and head for the mountains to cross over into Switzerland, briefly crossing paths with soldiers who are traveling on horseback. Hillary learns of the girls' sighting through the soldiers and, knowing that Heidi would lead the girls to her grandfather, decides to go to the Alps herself. Grandfather learns of the girls' crossing through Peter, and asks him to find them and bring them safely across. The girls go through the mountains and are found by Peter, who has brought them food. He leaves them the next morning to get a sled and, while he is gone, Signor Bonelli catches up with them. To protect his secrets, he intends to fake an accident in which all the girls fall off the mountain. Heidi calls Peter, who arrives in time to save them; ;Signor Bonelli struggles with Peter and falls off the mountain to his death. The group cross the mountains, Heidi is reunited with Grandfather, and the Brookings girls are reunited with Hillary. Grandfather, Hillary, Peter and all the girls share a Christmas dinner. Clarissa is to be adopted by Grandfather, Signor Bonelli's orphanage is closed, but the war is still on. Peter declares he has to leave, but he promises to return to Heidi.

Built in 1903, it has served as a center of government on the island for much of the time since then. Government House was listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1990. Government House is located in Fagatogo on Maugaoalii Mt. and overlooks the Pago Pago Bay area on all sides of its mountaintop location.Hills, J.W. (2010). O upu muamua i le Tala i le Lalolagi mo e ua faatoa a'oa'oina u lea mataupu: Elementary Geography. Nabu Press. Page 61. . Description and history left Government House is set on Observatory Point, located at the crook of the L-shaped Pago Pago Harbor, between the villages of Utulei and Fagatogo. The original block of the house is a wood frame cruciform structure, mounted on concrete piers. It is two stories in height, with a corrugated metal roof and clapboard siding. As built it was nearly encircled by porches on both levels, but portions of these have been enclosed. A one-room addition extends the building to the east. Due to its siting on a ridge sometimes exposed to hurricane-force winds, the building is secured by ten-foot metal spikes embedded in the ground. The interior of the house has features unique to its location and status. The ground floor has five public rooms, including a large dining room, a formal sitting area, and a distinctively Samoan room, lined with tapa cloth and housing Samoan artifacts. Another aspect of the property's public role is the presence of a ceremonial guest house (fala tele) on the property. When the United States gained control of what is now American Samoa due to the Tripartite Convention of 1899, the island was placed under the administration of the United States Navy. This house was built on the orders of Admiral Uriel Sebree in 1903. From this house naval governors administered the territory until 1951, when administration was turned over to the United States Department of the Interior. It has since been the official residence of the territory's civilian governors, and has been host to virtually every major dignitary to visit the island..

He is best known for singing and writing the 1986 No. 1 power ballad, \\"(I Just) Died in Your Arms\\" for his band Cutting Crew, which saw international success including a top 10 placing in the UK Singles Chart.  Career  = 1978/81 = While working as a hospital orderly in the late 1970s, Van Eede was discovered playing by ex member of The Animals, Chas Chandler, who sent him on a tour of Poland as support for Slade. Van Eede was only 18 when sent on the road. He recalls, \\"I went with a kazoo and an acoustic guitar and opened for Slade in amphitheatres in front of 18,000 people. I went down as a storm and had the loudest kazoo in Europe, because Slade took their own PA on the road!\\" His career continued with tours supporting headliners like David Essex, Hot Chocolate and Alan Price. During that time, Van Eede released five solo singles on Barn Records between 1978 and 1980, but none of them charted in the UK Singles Chart. The first three were \\"Rock 'n' Roll Fool\\" b/w \\"Ounce of Sense\\", \\"All or Nothing\\" b/w \\"Hold on to Your Heart\\" and \\"I Only Want to Be Number One\\" b/w \\"Dicing\\". = The Drivers (1981‚Äì1983) = Van Eede formed The Drivers with friends Mac Norman and Steve Boorer. In the early 1980s, they signed with a record label in Canada. They had a couple of hits there with \\"Tears on Your Anorak\\" and \\"Talk All Night\\", plus an album, Short Cuts. They had a support band called Fast Forward, whose line up included guitarist Kevin MacMichael. Van Eede was impressed with MacMichael's guitar playing that the former asked MacMichael to form a new band with him, however MacMichael could not commit at that time. After a final single release with \\"Things\\", a Bobby Darin cover, The Drivers split in 1983. = Cutting Crew (1985‚Äì1992) = Whilst Kevin MacMichael was with Fast Forward, the band was involved in an auto accident which left all of the members except MacMichael unable to continue touring. Ready to begin working with Van Eede, MacMichael moved from Toronto to London, where the two of them gave themselves one year to sign a recording contract. They recruited drummer Martin \\"Frosty\\" Beedle, previously a member of the cabaret band on the QE2, and bass player Colin Farley, a session musician living in Spain. Van Eede came up with the band's name after reading an article in the British rock magazine Sounds, which described the band Queen as a \\"cutting crew\\", meaning a band that does not play concerts and instead stays in the studio recording new songs. In 1985, Cutting Crew staged a showcase at a London recording studio for representatives from numerous record labels, and won a recording contract with Siren Records, part of Virgin Records. The first single to be released by the band was \\"(I Just) Died in Your Arms\\" b/w \\"For the Longest Time\\", released in the UK in August 1986. After an appearance on the BBC Television show Top of the Pops, with the song being regularly played on the radio and its music video shown on TV, the single shot up to number 4 in the UK Singles Chart and in May 1987 was number 1 in America for two weeks (Virgin's first number one single in America). In total, the song went to No. 1 in nineteen countries. This would be their biggest hit single. Van Eede came up with the title and concept for \\"(I Just) Died in Your Arms\\" after making love with his then- girlfriend. \\"I actually remember saying that,\\" he admitted, and promptly jotted a note on a pad he always kept close at hand. The next single, \\"I've Been in Love Before\\" b/w \\"Life in a Dangerous Time\\" failed to break the UK in its first release in November 1986 but was quickly released again to reach No. 50 in the charts. The album Broadcast was released shortly, which reached 41 in the UK Albums Chart. = Genesis audition (1996) = After Cutting Crew's demise, Van Eede went on to write and produce for other artists, including producing the original demo of Cher's hit \\"Believe\\". In 1996, he auditioned for the job as the new lead singer of Genesis. After Phil Collins's departure, he auditioned along with numerous others. After impressing both Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford in earlier auditions, it came down to the last two being Van Eede and the former Stiltskin singer Ray Wilson. Eventually the job was offered to Wilson, who accepted. =2000s= On the 2001 Marillion album Anoraknophobia, Van Eede is co-credited with writing the song \\"Map of the World\\" with singer Steve Hogarth. A new album originally entitled Grinning Souls was released by Cutting Crew in 2005. Van Eede also appeared on the ITV show Hit Me Baby One More Time, on which he performed \\"(I Just) Died in Your Arms\\" and a cover version of Macy Gray's hit \\"I Try\\". He then embarked on tour with his new line-up: Gareth Moulton (guitar), Sam Flynn (keyboards), Dominic Finley (bass) and Tom Arnold (drums). They toured the UK (which included the 'Here & Now 2008 Tour'), Germany, Trinidad and the United States. =Recent work= In 2015, a new album was released, Add to Favourites. Joining Van Eede on the album included guitarists Gareth Moulton and Joolz Dunkley, bassist Nick Kay, keyboardist Jono Harrison, drummer Martyn Baker and the Blackjack Horns. Throughout 2015‚Äì2017, the band toured South America, the U.S., Australasia and Europe. In 2020, Nick recently received a BMI (Broadcast Music Inc) award for 5 million plays on US radio for \\"(I Just) Died in Your Arms\\". The track was also used in the hit film The Lego Batman Movie and in an episode of season 3 in the popular Netflix series ‚ÄúStranger Things‚Äù =Other projects= Since 2008, Van Eede has been a member of supergroup Man Doki Soulmates, formed by Hungarian musician Leslie M√°ndoki. Alongside Van Eede, the band's members in the group have included, amongst others: Randy Brecker, Bill Evans, John Helliwell, Chris Thompson, Bobby Kimball, Ian Anderson, Chaka Khan, Tony Carey and the late Jack Bruce and Greg Lake.

The paper containing the equation was co- authored by Dr. Dean Burk, and was entitled \\"The Determination of Enzyme Dissociation Constants (1934)\\". It remains the most frequently cited paper to appear in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Lineweaver and Burk collaborated with the eminent statistician W. Edwards Deming on the statistical analysis of their data: they used the plot for illustrating the results, not for the analysis itself. Linearizations of the Henri-Michaelis- Menten law of enzyme kinetics were important in the era before general availability of computers to determine the parameters Vmax and Km from experimental data, even though there are significant statistical problems involved in this procedure. . These are still used for data presentation. All three possible methods of linearization (now often called Lineweaver-Burk, Eadie-Hofstee and Hanes plots, respectively) were originally proposed by Woolf, who was unable to formally publish them due to injuries received in a car accident. However, he had discussed them with his close friend and fellow member of the British Communist Party, J. B. S. Haldane, who referred to them in his seminal book on enzyme kinetics.. However, the linearizations were largely ignored until they were re-invented by the authors whose name they now bear.. Lineweaver developed the Lineweaver‚ÄìBurk equation in 1934 while still a graduate student, working as a laboratory assistant under Burk at the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C. He is an internationally recognized authority on food technology as it is applied to the processing, preservation and safety of poultry and eggs. Early life Lineweaver received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Chemistry from George Washington University in 1930, and continued on to receive his Masters of Arts degree there in 1933. He obtained his PhD in Physical Chemistry from Johns Hopkins University in 1936. In 1929, a year before graduating, he was appointed a Junior Scientific Aid to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and worked as a chemist in the fertilizer section of the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils. In 1930, Lineweaver was transferred to the Food Research Division of the USDA as an Associate Chemist pursuing enzyme research. In 1939, he was transferred to the newly built Western Regional Research Laboratory of the USDA in Albany, California as Senior Biochemist and head of the enzyme section in the biochemical division. During and after World War II, Dr. Lineweaver collaborated with the Quartermasters Corps of the Armed Services in enzyme work related to poultry and powdered egg flavor and processing. In 1948, he was appointed Chief of the WRRL Poultry Laboratory in 1949, a position he held until his retirement in 1973, after 44 years of continuous service for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. During his career, Dr. Lineweaver was the author or co-author of nearly 100 technical publications and six patents, over half of which concern aspects of poultry and eggs, and the remainder with enzymology or other aspects of biochemistry. He and his team developed the first USDA-approved method of pasteurizing egg white, and established a process of converting waste feathers into feed. He has received honors, citations and awards, including the Nicholas Appert Award from the Institute of food Technologists (IFT) in 1973. Hans was a President of the IFT in 1971, and was appointed by the State Department to chair the U.S. Delegation to the 12th World Poultry Congress in Australia in 1962. He was an active member or chairman of organizations including the American Chemical Society, the Poultry Science Association, the World Poultry Science Association, the Poultry and Egg National Board, the Institute of American Poultry Industries, and the American Society of Biological Chemists. Personal life Hans Lineweaver was born in Pickens, West Virginia on Christmas Day, 1907, the second child of Rev. Dr. Jesse Luther and Lucille Lineweaver. He was married in 1936 to Margaret Peggy Coon of Baltimore, MD, and is the father of 2, the grandfather of 15, the great-grandfather of 29 and the great-great grandfather of 11. He lived in retirement in Walnut Creek, California. Lineweaver died in Walnut Creek on June 10, 2009 at age 101.

Accessed June 24, 2008.Ayoob, Massad. \\"Kahr's PM9\\" , Guns Magazine, November 2003, p.48-56, p.73-75. Accessed June 24, 2008. The target market for the PM line is the civilian concealed carry market, as well as being intended as backup weapons for law enforcement officers.Clapp, Wiley. \\"New Kahr PM9 9mm‚Äù , Combat Handguns, September 2002, pp. 10‚Äì15. Accessed June 24, 2008. Development When the first Kahr pistols appeared on the market in 1994 they were constructed entirely of carbon steel. Early Kahr models such as the K9 were praised as well-made and solidly constructed, but criticized for their excessive weight, which is a disadvantage in a weapon intended for concealed carry. Kahr attempted to address these concerns by introducing pistols that were physically smaller, as well as a line of polymer framed models.Clapp, Wiley. ‚ÄúINSTANT CLASSICS‚Äù , Guns & Ammo, March 2004, pp. 66‚Äì71. Accessed June 24, 2008. The PM series combined both these approaches, introducing polymer framed pistols that were also the smallest Kahr models ever produced.\\"Kahr Arms PM9\\" , American Rifleman magazine, P. 84-85, October 2004. Accessed June 24, 2008. Design features PM series pistols are manufactured with stainless steel slides that ride on steel inserts within the polymer frames, preventing the wear which would otherwise be inherent with metal slide to plastic frame contact.Detty, Mike. \\"Kahr PM45 .45ACP\\" , Combat Handguns, June 2008, pp. 38‚Äì42, 91. Accessed June 24, 2008. The PM is available in 9√ó19mm (PM9), .40 S&W; (PM40), and .45 ACP (PM45). The series is noted for being very no-nonsense and utilitarian in appearance, with black plastic grips and a brushed stainless or blackened Tungsten DLC (Diamond-Like Coating) stainless slides. Produced by applying a thin but tough protective coating, the DLC patina was labeled \\"Black Diamond\\" in early production, and is valued for its lack of attention-catching light reflection in dim surroundings. DLC coatings also serve to protect the slide from oxidization, nicks and scrapes. PM pistols are known for having very smooth and consistent DAO trigger pulls of approximately six pounds, and large and easy to see sights in various configurations including night sights.Sagi, Guy. \\"Kahr PM40\\" , Shooting Illustrated, July 2004, pp. 62‚Äì63. Accessed June 24, 2008. Simplified controls exemplified by the lack of a manual safety lever are also positive attributes and contribute to a desirable package for concealment use. The PM series is also noted for having a fully enclosed trigger draw bar. The engineering design work necessary to fit it inside the cramped space of the receiver resulted in several beneficial lockwork changes. One such change was that the cartridge feed ramp had to be offset, which in turn allowed the overall receiver design to be thinner, it also permitted the slide to be more squat with a low bore axis, resulting is less muzzle rise and flip. The PM barrel configuration boasts polygonal rifling, which in theory will wear longer and gather less fouling. Almost all Kahr pistol designs share a common function and trigger action. Criticisms While highly regarded overall, reviewers have offered various criticisms of the PM series. The entire PM product line is known for requiring a 'breaking-in' period. Kahr Arms has indicated that its products are to be broken in with at least 200 rounds fired initially, as is the case with many semi-automatic firearms. In addition, though the 9√ó19mm PM9 has the reputation of being controllable with some minor modification of firing techniques, the .40 and .45 caliber variants are known to produce gun- handling difficulties in rapid fire due to their heavier recoil and resulting muzzle rise. In response to this criticism, some reviewers have observed that very small and light large bore pistols in general share this reputation, suggesting that they are best wielded by experienced and proficient shooters who practice regularly. Other known PM series deficiencies include excessive trigger travel, and a magazine release which occasionally fails to allow magazines to fall freely on the PM40 model. The magazine release and recoil springs on the PM40 pistol have also been known to occasionally break.Ayoob, Massad . \\"CARRYIN' KAHRS\\" , The Complete Book of Handguns 2005, pp. 86‚Äì91.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. and On August 28, 1941, the two guns shot sixteen rounds at a target floating in Pago Pago Harbor. The guns‚Äô discharge could be heard for miles away. Approximately one week after the guns were tested, ten rounds were shot from each of the two recently- placed guns at Breakers Point.Shaffer, Robert J. (2000). American Samoa: 100 Years Under the United States Flag. Island Heritage. Page 169. . Description and history As seen in 2007. Blunts Point is a projection on the west side of the mouth of Pago Pago Harbor, on the south side of the island of Tutuila, southeast of the village of Utulei. Two six-inch naval guns are mounted at a point about above sea level, at this point, which has a commanding view of the harbor entrance. The guns are mounted in circular concrete structures with a parapet about high around the outside. A short way below the emplacement is a magazine which is built into the hillside. The battery has recently been restored and is in good condition. It is accessible to the public via a moderately difficult hiking trail. The tensions of World War II prompted the United States government to begin fortifying American Samoa in 1940. United States Marines installed the two guns at Blunts Point, and another two on the east side of the harbor at Breakers Point. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the capture of Guam shortly thereafter, American Samoa became of critical importance as the only major American base in the western Pacific, and it was further fortified in anticipation of attack. Although no attack ever came, American Samoa was a critical supply and training point for American military actions in the Pacific.

It aired annually during the Christmas season on Freeform and as of 2018 airs on AMC. Synopsis It is Pinocchio's first Christmas and Geppetto is trying to figure out how to buy a Christmas present for him, so he sells his boots to buy an arithmetic book for Pinocchio, who later on sells the book to buy a present for Geppetto. However, he soon runs into the Fox and Cat, whom he thinks are his only friends. The Fox and Cat convince Pinocchio that he should bury the money he got back for the book in the snow, and when the sun sets, they will grow into a Christmas tree covered with many gold and silver coins. Pinocchio does exactly that, and then, while he's not there to pay attention, the Fox and Cat dig the coins out of the ground before he returns. When Pinocchio returns and finds that the tree didn't grow, he takes part in a local Christmas marionette show run by Maestro Fire-Eater, where he plays Sir Larry Olive-Tree. During the show, he befriends Julietta, one of Fire-Eater's marionettes. After the show, Fire-Eater tells Pinocchio that he needs to turn Jullietta into one of the Three Wise Men for a Christmas pageant next week. But Pinocchio runs off, taking Julietta with him, and Fire-Eater calls a nearby gendarme to chase after him. Pinocchio manages to elude the gendarmes and brings Julietta with him to the Forest of Enchantment, where he was born. Pinocchio explains his backstory to her and afterwards he fears he may never see his father again. Just then, the Fox and the Cat show up telling Pinocchio they know how he can bring Julietta to life using a secret medicine, which he can only find if he goes on a sleigh ride over seven mountains and seven valleys. Before Pinocchio can embark on that journey though, a blue light appears calling out his name which scares away the Fox and Cat and causes Pinocchio to faint. It is soon revealed to be Lady Azora, who planted the seed that grew into the tree Pinocchio was originally chopped down from. She brings in a doctor, whom Pinocchio recognizes as the Talking Cricket he met before. Pinocchio attempts to explain his terrible action of stealing Julietta from Fire-Eater by lying, which causes his nose to grow. Upon seeing what has happened to his nose, Pinocchio tells the truth and it returns to normal. Azora tells Pinocchio that the only gift he really needs to give Geppetto is love, for that is the greatest gift anyone can give. With that, Pinocchio leaves Julietta in Lady Azora's care, and Dr. Cricket goes to make sure Pinocchio stays out of trouble. Pinocchio starts making his way home, but he suddenly again runs into the Fox and Cat, who say that he should go to the North Pole and get a job teaching Santa Claus' toys how to dance. They bring Pinocchio to a sleigh driver they were speaking with earlier who wraps Pinocchio up in a gift box and sells it to a duke who needs a present to give to his children, whom he does not spend much time with. When the kids open up their present, Pinocchio tells the Duke that he should stay home with his kids for Christmas. Afterward, Santa Claus arrives in his sleigh and brings Pinocchio and Dr. Cricket back to Geppetto's workshop, where Pinocchio is joyously reunited with his father and promises to always be a good boy.

The legislation creating mayoral academies was championed by a coalition of community and business leaders led by Cumberland, RI Mayor Daniel McKee and passed into law as part of the 2009 Rhode Island state budget, which was approved on June 17, 2008. History The mayoral academy idea in Rhode Island was originated by Mayor Daniel McKee and developed by a coalition of Rhode Island mayors and town administrators, Cumberland Director of Children, Youth, and Learning Michael Magee, Progreso Latino CEO Ramon Martinez, and policy experts Bryan Hassel of Public Impact and Martin R. West of Brown University. The eight Rhode Island municipal leaders supporting the plan were Joseph Almond, Town Administrator of Lincoln, RI; James E. Doyle, Mayor of Pawtucket, RI; Daniel J. McKee, Mayor of Cumberland, RI; Charles Moreau, Mayor of Central Falls, RI; David Cicilline, Mayor of Providence, RI; Charles Lombardi, Mayor of North Providence, RI; Michael T. Napolitano, Mayor of Cranston, RI; and Joe Polisena, Mayor of Johnston, RI. Prominent business and community leaders working on behalf of its passage included Alan Hassenfeld, Chairman of the Executive Committee at Hasbro; Angus Davis, Rhode Island Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education; Laurie White, Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce; Stephanie Chafee, Founder, Rhode Island Free Clinic; and Ron Wolk, Founder of Education Week and Chairman of The Big Picture Company. The legislation creating the academies was introduced as H7874 in the Rhode Island House during the 2008 legislative session. With the support of Majority Leader Gordon Fox and Majority Whip Peter Kilmartin, it was subsequently added as Article 38 in the state budget.  Schools  In fall 2009, Seth Andrew was recruited to found the first Mayoral Academy, Democracy Prep Blackstone Valley (DPBV) (now known as Blackstone Valley Prep), which serves students from Central Falls, Cumberland, Lincoln and Pawtucket who were selected through a random lottery.Mayoral Academies www.mayoralacademies.org DPBV was based on the successful model of public charter schools based in Harlem, NY and as a Brown University Graduate, Andrew was one of the few charter network leaders in the nation who had ties to the state of Rhode Island. Democracy Prep is one of the highest performing schools in the City of New York, and the network currently serves more than 5,000 low- income students across five regions. After the Rhode Island gubernatorial election of 2010, Democracy Prep parted ways with the board of Rhode Island Mayoral Academies citing major concerns about the political and financial risks presented by the Mayoral Academy model to their mission and model. Since 2010, Blackstone Valley Prep has continued to grow the number of campuses it operates. Additional Mayoral Academies have opened including Achievement First in Providence and Rise Prep in Woonsocket.  Scandals  Two of the founding members of the Rhode Island Mayoral Academies founding coalition, Mayor Charles Moreau and Speaker Gordon Fox, have been convicted on federal corruption charges. Because the original Mayoral Academies legislation was championed by Fox and Moreau, the governance model has been attacked by traditional school districts as presenting unnecessary risks of political interference and financial impropriety. No other charter school governance model in the nation requires that Mayors chair the board of individual schools and Governor Gina Raimondo signed a bill slowing the growth of charter networks in Rhode Island. Blackstone Valley Prep teachers resigned in 2016 after students at the school hacked into teachers Slack accounts. In the expletive-ridden messages that were leaked, teachers spoke casually about students, calling them \\"idiots,\\" and \\"dumb [expletives].\\" Some parents called for the BVP Executive Director Jeremy Chiappetta to resign, and he responded with an open letter to the school community asking for their forgiveness.

Biography Hermann Beckh was born in Nuremberg to a factory owner, Eugen Beckh, and his wife Marie, n√©e Seiler (died 1943). He had a sister some 12 years younger with whom he had a close friendship until she died in 1929. Due to his unusual memory skills, he graduated from high school with excellent marks in 1893 and received a scholarship at the Munich Maximilianeum. Given his many interests and talents, he found the initial decision of field of study a difficult one; his peers encouraged him towards law. He completed his studies of law with a prizewinning thesis Die Beweislast nach dem B√ºrgerlichen Gesetzbuch (The Onus of Proof, from the Civil Law Code) and was employed as an assessor until 1899. It became clear to him that he was not made out to be a judge when he had to impose a fine on a poor married couple for stealing wood. He paid the couple's fine out of his own pocket and left his position. He later took up the study of oriental languages, Indology, and Tibetology at the Christian-Albrechts-Universit√§t at Kiel. In 1907, he received his doctorate at Humboldt-Universit√§t at Berlin with a thesis on Kalidasa's poem Meghaduta. He received his final degree the following year with further work on this poem. He taught as a private tutor of the Tibetan language until 1921 and worked cataloguing Tibetan manuscripts at the Staatsbibliothek in Berlin. In 1911, he met Rudolf Steiner and Friedrich Rittelmeyer, which led to his intensive study of Steiner's work. On Christmas Day, 1912, he became a member of the Anthroposophical Society. In 1916, Beckh was drafted into military service, shortly after Sammlung G√∂schen published two volumes about the Buddha and his teachings. Next stationed in the Balkans, he was called to work in the Institut f√ºr Weltwirtschaft an der Universit√§t Kiel (Kiel Institute for the World Economy), where he evaluated economic reviews in Scandinavian newspapers. Due to his task, he was permitted to learn the Scandinavian languages in addition to the languages he already knew: English, French, Italian, Classical Greek and Latin, Hebrew, Egyptian, Sanskrit, Tibetan and Old Persian. His civil obligations lasted until the next world war. During that period, he resumed lecturing, but declined a teaching contract for Tibetan philology and went on vacation. He brought his vacation to an abrupt end when he was appointed to the position of \\"extraordinary professor\\", but ended his academic career in November 1921. From 1920 onwards, he worked as a lecturer of anthroposophy. In March 1922, he joined the Gr√ºnderkreis (circle of priests) of The Christian Community and worked until his death as a priest, seminary teacher, lecturer, independent researcher and writer. In 1928, Beckh's Der kosmische Rhythmus im Markusevangelium (\\"Mark's Gospel: The Cosmic Rhythm\\") was published, in which he related the narration of the gospel of Mark to the path of the sun through the twelve zodiacal signs, and mentioned earlier work of Arthur Drews, Eduard Stucken (author of Astralmythen der Hebraeer, Babylonier, und Aegypter, Leipzig, 1896-1907)Eduard Stucken Astralmythen der Hebraeer, Babylonier, und Aegypter, Leipzig, Pfeiffer, 1896-1907[Astralmythen der Hebraeer, Babylonier, und Aegypter, Leipzig, Pfeiffer, 1896-1907] and Andrzej Niemojewski.Mark's Gospel: The Cosmic Rhythm, 2015, p. 35 In the Introduction to the sequel, Der kosmische Rhythmus, das Sternengeheimnis und Erdengeheimnis im Johannesevangelium (\\"The Cosmic Rhythm, the Secrets of the Stars and Earth in the Gospel of John\\") (1930), Beck mentioned favourably Wilhelm Kaiser's Die geometrischen Vorstellungen in der Astronomie (1928), and referred to The Novices of Sais, of Novalis. The cosmic rhythm in Beckh's exposition, he explained, was for Mark's gospel understood more in connection with the \\"earthly\\" zodiac of the signs, and for John's gospel more in connection with the \\"stellar\\" zodiac of the constellations,Hermann Beckh, John‚Äôs Gospel: The Cosmic Rhythm ‚ÄìStars and Stones, Anastasi Ltd 2015, p.38. while, at the time of the beginning of the Christian era, these were coincident.Hermann Beckh, John‚Äôs Gospel: The Cosmic Rhythm ‚ÄìStars and Stones, Anastasi Ltd 2015, p.446.

Oliver Chace began his career as a carpenter working for pioneer industrialist Samuel Slater in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Later, he would become influential in organizing several new mills, including one at Fall River, Massachusetts in 1813. The first textile manufacturing company at Valley Falls was established in 1818. By 1839, Oliver Chace was a very successful figure in the rapidly developing textile industry. He acquired and reorganized the Valley Falls mills, and eventually added two larger mills, one on each side of the river. His sons Samuel and Harvey would also be involved with expanding the company during this time.Elizabeth Buffum Chace and Lillie Chace Wyman: A Century of Abolitionist The north side of the Village of Valley Falls grew to be the center of town government for the Town of Cumberland which it was located in. The town hall is located there today. The southern part of the village of Valley Falls, originally part of Lincoln, Rhode Island, would eventually become part of the City of Central Falls in 1895. The Valley Falls Company would eventually acquire the Albion Mills, Tar- Kiln Factory in Burrillville, Manville Mills in Rhode Island, and Moodus Cotton Factory in Connecticut. In 1929, the Valley Falls Company, and others would combine with the Berkshire Manufacturing Company of Adams, Massachusetts to become Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates. The Valley Falls mills were closed in 1930, and operations were moved elsewhere. The mills on the Cumberland side were demolished in 1934 to avoid property taxes. The site remained vacant until 1991 when the Town of Cumberland and the Blackstone Valley National Heritage Corridor transformed the site into a historic park. Walkways, ramps and bridges meander along the steep slope and through the former mill site. Some of its foundations are still visible, as is the northern power canal trench. The 1855 brick mill on the southern, Central Falls side still remains, having been converted into senior housing in 1979; it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It ranks as one of the earliest mill conversion projects in New England. Although the older mill closer to the river has been significantly altered and a large addition was built east of the main mill, it is still possible to observe the original power trench which flows through the mills, as well as the original brick mill tower. The gate house that directed water into the trench still stands by the dam. A similar structure once stood in the park on the Cumberland side of the falls, but is no longer standing. Parts of its foundation are still visible, as is the northern power canal.

John Hughes (born April 28, 1930) is an American journalist, a former Nieman Fellow at Harvard University, and winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of Indonesia and the Overseas Press Club Award for an investigation into the international narcotics traffic. He served as editor of The Christian Science Monitor and The Deseret News and is a former president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Hughes has written two books and writes a nationally syndicated column for The Christian Science Monitor. Biography =Childhood= Hughes was born on 28 April 1930 in Neath, Wales, the only child of Evan and Dellis May Hughes. He was raised in London and attended the Ancient Literary Company Trade School. During World War II, both of Hughes' parents contributed to the war effort ‚Äì his father was drafted into the British Army and served in North Africa for three years. His mother was conscripted into the Government Post Office during that time as well. Following the war, the entire family moved to South Africa. =Education, early career, and Pulitzer= At the age of 16 Hughes started his first job as a reporter at Natal Mercury. Alex Hammond, his first editor, sent him to business school to learn shorthand. Hughes then worked as a reporter for three years before returning to London, where he worked on Fleet Street at a news agency. He eventually was hired by the London-based The Daily Mirror. Shortly after accepting that position, The Natal Mercury contacted Hughes and asked him to come back to be the Chief of the State Capital Bureau. He accepted. He later became a stringer and a freelance writer for a number of papers in London and The Christian Science Monitor in Boston. In 1955, at the age of 25, Hughes moved to America and began working in Boston for The Christian Science Monitor. About 18 months later he was sent back to South Africa as a correspondent for The Monitor. He filled that position for six years. Hughes was named the Nieman Fellow at Harvard University the following year. He then worked as an assistant foreign editor in Boston. His next assignment from The Monitor sent him to be a foreign correspondent in Asia for six years. It was during this time that he won the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting in 1967 for his thorough reporting of the attempted Communist coup in Indonesia in 1965 and the violent purge of communists that followed in 1965‚Äì66. His achievements were readily recognized by The Christian Science Monitor, and he was promoted to Managing Editor, a position which he held for nine years from 1970‚Äì1979, until he was promoted to Editor and Manager. During his three-year stint as Editor and Manager, Hughes became interested in owning his own newspaper. =Newspaper ownership and political involvement= His initial purchase was a weekly paper in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, called the Cape Cod Oracle, based in Orleans. Hughes Newspapers, Inc. eventually included five weekly newspapers. The company purchased the Cape Cod News in Hyannis from Frank Fallaci and founded the Yarmouth Sun and Dennis Bulletin in the towns of Dennis and Yarmouth. Hughes Newspapers also published the Lower Cape Shoppers Guide. Hughes sold the newspapers to the G.W. Prescott Publishing Co. in Quincy, in the mid-1980s. The new organization became known as MPG Cape Newspapers, and was operated by MPG Communications in Plymouth. Later MPG Cape Newspapers became Cape Cod Newspapers. Shortly before Ronald Reagan was elected president, Hughes received a call from one of Reagan's advisors, asking him what Reagan should say in his acceptance speech, should he be elected. Hughes offered some ideas, which were remembered and used. Shortly after Reagan was elected, Hughes was asked to move to Washington D.C. to serve in Reagan's administration from 1981‚Äì1985. He initially served as the Associate Director of the United States Information Agency, and was later appointed as the director of the Voice of America. While serving in that capacity, he received a phone call from George Shultz inviting Hughes to be the spokesman for the State Department and Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. Back in Orleans, the joke among editors and reporters in the Cape Cod Oracle newsroom was, \\"poor John Hughes: he can't hold down a job for more than six months.\\" Following four years in Washington D.C., Hughes returned to Massachusetts where his newspapers were flourishing. He resumed his control of the companies, but eventually sold them when neither of his children wanted to fill his position. Hughes was then asked by The Christian Science Monitor to be in charge of a shortwave radio international program. He did this for a few years and then bought a newspaper in Maine with a friend of his who worked at The Washington Post. The partnership was unsuccessful and short-lived, resulting in the paper being resold, which enabled Hughes to accept further administrative appointments. In 1991 he was asked to chair President George H. W. Bush's bipartisan Task Force on the future of US government international broadcasting. In 1992 he was appointed Chairman of a joint Presidential-Congressional Commission on Broadcasting to the People's Republic of China. In 1993, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting appointed Hughes to its Advisory Commission on Public Broadcasting to the World. Hughes then accepted an offer from Brigham Young University (BYU) to begin the International Media Study Program. In 1995, Boutros Boutros Ghali, the Secretary General of the United Nations, requested for Hughes to meet with him. During the meeting, Ghali asked if Hughes would be willing to do some work for the United Nations during the 50th Anniversary of the United Nations. BYU granted Hughes a year leave of absence, and he became an Assistant Secretary General and Director of Communications at the United Nations. In 1996, Neal A. Maxwell called Hughes with concerns about the Deseret News, a secular newspaper owned by the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Maxwell solicited his advice on improving the paper's circulation. When Hughes returned from the United Nations he began work as a consultant for the Deseret News. Following his counsel, the paper switched its distribution to morning rather than afternoon, which improved circulation. Following the success of this change, the board of directors asked Hughes to be the editor of the newspaper. Hughes accepted the position, and became the first non- Mormon editor of the Deseret News. He filled that position for 10 years, until 2007, at which point he returned to BYU as a Professor in the Communications Department. =Later years= Hughes went to South Africa in 2007 to make a presentation to local media organizations.http://southafrica.usembassy.gov/wwwhnews070828c.html In 2011 he received the National Council for International Visitors' Citizen Diplomat Media Award. As of 2012 he continues to write a columnCommentary - John Hughes for the Christian Science Monitor. In 2014, he published an autobiography, Paper Boy to Pulitzer, which he said he wrote for his children and grandchildren, and because ‚ÄúI thought I had a love story in me, and it‚Äôs about journalism. The greatest profession in the world.‚Äù Personal Life Hughes and his wife Peggy, a BYU alumnus, have a child, Evan. He has two other children, Mark and Wendy, through an earlier marriage to the late Libby Hughes. He has six grandchildren. Hughes is a member of the Christian Science Church.

It also operates in other countries including the United Kingdom and the United States and was originally established as Tour Agenturer in 1925 in Stockholm. TAC has announced a name change to Schneider Electric, its parent company, to take place in October 2009. History =1925-1995= Founded as Tour Agenturer in Stockholm in 1925, the company produced a product range focusing particularly on draught regulators and radiator valves. It continued to develop its product range introducing the first transistorized heating regulator in 1962 and a computer- based system for climate control in 1974. Tour Agenturer became Tour & Andersson in 1977 following a merger with AH Andersson. Over the following years, Tour & Andersson extend its product range to include an integrated access control system and hotel management and signal system in 1980 and 1981 respectively. In 1987 it released Micro 7, an IBM PC-based control system with an easier user interface than previously available and operated with a mouse in a similar fashion to modern day computers. In 1994, the company released TAC Vista and \\"moves towards open systems architecture.\\" The following year, Tour & Andersson was separated into two companies: TA Hydronics and TA Control. =1996-2006= The first major development by TA Control arrived in 1996 with TAC Xenta, a programmable control system featuring graphical programming. The following year TA Control changed its name to TAC and focused equally on its services and systems operations in addition to its international partner networks. TAC acquired Norwegian major systems integration company Solberg Andersen in 1998 shortly before being bought by investment company EQT. Between 1998 and 2006, several more acquisitions and mergers took place, beginning with TAC's acquisition of Danish-based Danfoss System Automatik. It then merged with CSI--an American company based in Dallas, Texas--in 2000 to create a new company of 2,000 employees covering three major regions: Europe, the Americas and the Pacific. This merger was extremely successful and led to consulting firm Frost & Sullivan awarding its 2001 'Market Engineering Merger & Acquisition Strategy Award' to the newly formed TAC Group. The years 2002 and 2003 brought further development for TAC Group with its acquisition of both Control Solutions and MicroSign in 2002 before TAC Group was itself acquired by French-based Schneider Electric in 2003. In 2004, the company bought Seattle-based Abacus Engineered Systems which was then merged with the Energy Solutions Division of TAC. In the same year TAC's parent company, Schneider Electric, acquired Andover Controls which was then merged with TAC to boost its security operations in addition to expanding its building automation activities. The company became Tour Andover Controls and merged with three more companies over the next two years: Satchwell Controls and the European division of Invensys Advanced Building Systems in 2005, and Invensys Building Systems (IBS) in 2006. It became TAC Satchwell for a brief period between 2005 and 2007 during the integration of Satchwell Controls into the company. =2007 to present= The year 2007 brought TAC's most recent merger with Pelco, Dean Meyer in charge of the Pelco division.
