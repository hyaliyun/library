He was naturalised as an American and worked as a professor of Greek. His fiction and poetry generally dealt with historical themes, while his work as a Gothic novelist often had an Irish background. Life and works The Maturin family was descended from a Huguenot clergyman who fled to Ireland after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Edward's father, Reverend Charles Robert Maturin, was curate of St. Peter's church, Dublin, and well known as a preacher, as well as a poet and Gothic novelist. Born the second son, Edward entered Trinity College, Dublin at the age of 15 and graduated at 20. Immediately afterwards he emigrated to the US in 1832 with letters of introduction from the poet Thomas Moore and other Irish writers. Having studied law under Charles O'Conor, he was called to the bar but later became professor of Greek in the College of South Carolina and applied for American naturalisation in 1837. He married Harriet Lord Gailiard in 1842 and had three children by her. In 1848 he returned to New York, where for upwards of thirty years he filled professorships in Greek, Latin and Belles Lettres. His mastery of Greek was such that he was selected in 1850 by the American Bible Union as one of their revisers and worked on the gospel of St. Mark. Montezuma, doomed hero of Maturin's first novel, from a children‚Äôs history book All Edward Maturin's work was written in the U.S. and for the most part concentrated on historical themes or Irish fantasy. His first book contained the interconnected stories of Sejanus and Other Roman Tales (1839) and was dedicated to Washington Irving. They concern incidents during the reigns of the Roman emperors from Tiberius to Nero; self-consciously literary, the dialogue is written in an imitation of Shakespearean English.Available on Google Books This was followed by the two-volume romance, Montezuma, the Last of the Aztecs (1845)The first volume is on Google Books and then two works on Spanish themes. The long series of \\"Spanish Ballads\\" that originally appeared in the United States Democratic Revue during 1845 were eventually collected with his other poems in Lyrics of Spain and Erin (1850). They were followed by the romance Benjamin, the Jew of Grenada (1847), a story of the fall of the Moslem empire in Spain. After his move to New York, his prose work became more Gothic. It included The Irish Chieftain, or The Isles of Life and Death (1848) which was later to be dismissed as 'a wild story without foundation in history ... melodramatic, sentimental, extravagant‚Äô,Stephen Brown, Ireland in Fiction [Pt. I] (Dublin 1919) and the two-volume Eva, or the Isles of Life and Death (1848). His later Bianca, a tale of Erin and Italy (1852) was set in more modern times but equally condemned as ‚Äòan outlandish story, full of murders, characters - mostly illegitimate - with terrible secrets, a duel between brothers, banshees, mysterious lady-prophetesses, fee-faw-fum'.Stephen Brown's description. The novel is available on Google Books A final offering was his four-act play Viola (1858). Maturin died in New York City on 25 May 1881.

It provides a first hand account of the early stages of revolution and follows various leaders and organizers of the movement. The film is directed and produced by Fredrik Stanton and is being distributed by Zeitgeist Films. Synopsis The documentary begins with coverage of the spontaneous marches against the 30 year oppressive military rule of president Hosni Mubarak. For the first time in history, organizers and activists turned to social media to voice their opinions and organize protests in Tahrir Square. Though initially a peaceful demonstration, the violence of the police charged with putting down the revolution inspired further violence on both sides as protesters continued to demand that Hosni Mubarak step down from the presidency. When the appointment of the former head of the Egyptian General Intelligence Directorate, Omar Suleiman, as Vice-President was not enough to end protests, Mubarak agreed to step down on February 11, 2011. It was decided that the military would rule for six months until elections could be held. While the film only covers the events leading up to and shortly following the end of the Mubarak regime, the revolution in Egypt continues to this day as new challenges are faced.

It is composed of many hundreds of species. The larvae of some species are known to damage crops. Morphology Their morphology is complex due to their richly divergent forms. They are distinguished from the diurnal taxa, by their well-developed and true hypomera of the elytra, the free mobility of the thorax and hind body, and the free and non-fused pleurital and pleural margins of the sterna and elytra respectively. Biology Their morphology is believed to facilitate moisture absorption and accumulation, via the open body sutures and the loosely joined body parts. Subtribe Trachynotina excepting, they show an almost uniform tendency to be nocturnal, crepuscular or shade-loving. Like the tribe Tentyriini, their daily rhythm is based on a strictly nocturnal ancestral disposition. Their open and non-connate body sutures suggest the enjoyment of nocturnal conditions and night moisture. At night, a surface secretion of a sometimes pruinescent or waxy substance has been noted on the bodies of genera Brinckia, Namibomodes, Synhimba and Ocnodes (or Phanerotomea). This is assumed to prevent evaporation. Taxonomy The tribe Sepidiini is made up of 6 subtribes, about 55 genera, and more than 900 species.

He accomplished his PhD (supervised by Professor M. L. Friedman) in Moscow Institute of Plastics in 1990. His scientific interests include: superhydrophobicity, superoleophobicity, creating of surfaces with prescribed properties, plasma- and UV-treatment of surfaces, plasma treatment of seeds, liquid marbles and their self-propulsion, the Moses effect (magnetically inspired deformation of liquid surfaces). Professor Bormashenko is also active in quantitative linguistics, topological problems of physics (exemplifications of the \\"hairy ball\\" theorem), advanced dimensional analysis (extensions of the Buckingham theorem), variational analysis of \\"free ends\\" physical problems, enabling application of the \\"transversality conditions\\". In 1987 Dr. Bormashenko studied the mechanisms of destruction of ultra-thin island films by highly charged high-energy particles. In 2004 he investigated the vibrational spectrum of PVDF. In 2005-2006 he studied the breath-figures self-assembly and processes of patterning in rapidly evaporated polymer solutions. In 2006-2014 developed superhydrophobic and superoleophobic surfaces. He is known for his pioneering research of wetting transitions, and analytical thermodynamic derivations of the Cassie and Wenzel equations using the variational calculus. In 2011-2018 spent much effort in the investigation of liquid marbles. In 2012 started to study the modification of surface properties of biological objects (seeds) with the cold plasma. In 2015-2018 studied the self-propulsion processes inspired the Marangoni flows. In 2017-2018 participated in the investigation of the droplet cluster.

The concept is connected with an ongoing decentralization of energy systems with energy efficiency and renewable energy being used also for a strengthened local energy ownership. With new green technologies available, such a transition is possibly involving new actors: prosumers, renewable energy co-operatives and municipal, community-owned power stations which replace centralised, power corporations.

However, the energy must be produced in a way that it neither harms nor endangers the environmental or people. Concretely, this means leaving fossil fuels in the ground, socializing and democratizing the means of production and changing our attitude towards energy consumption.‚Äù quoted after the translation at B√ºro f√ºr eine demokratische Energiewende 2012 In 2014, a concept of energy democracy was promoted by the city of Boulogne-Billancourt in France. For its participation in the Bloomberg mayors challenge, the city presented an innovative vision of Energy democracy based on the reduction of the use of fossil fuels and a system of incentives to encourage citizens in reducing their energy consumption. Energy-democracy has been a successful concept of grass roots movements to combine resistance against fossil fuel exploitation like coal or shale gas with a positive alternative agenda.Kunze, Conrad and Becker, S√∂ren, Energy democracy in Europe: A survey and outlook, Rosa- Luxemburg-Stiftung Brussels Office, 2014. http://www.rosalux.de/publication/40662/energy-democracy-in-europe.html Many consider Germany and its transition to renewable energy (Energiewende) a role model of energy democracy. \\"The hope, moreover, is that energy democracy might offer new spaces for collaboration between ecological movements and movements for social, economic and workplace justice.\\"James Angel, Strategies of Energy Democracy, Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung Brussels Office, http://www.rosalux.de/publication/42125/strategien-der-energiedemokratie.html Academic, James Goodman, details the difference between energy policy in Germany and India, exploring public participation in approaches to renewable energy.

Kathy received her B.S. in Special Education in 1976 and an M.A. in Learning Disabilities in 1979, both from Eastern Michigan University. She taught in the field of special education in Michigan from 1976 to 1981, before moving to the state of Texas. From 1981 to 1987 she worked at DLM, Inc. of Allen, Texas marketing early childhood educational products and materials. Then, in 1987, personal friends Parker and Leach began working together on the idea that would become Barney & Friends.  Television career  Leach originally envisioned a talking teddy bear character, but that changed due to her young son's fascination with dinosaurs. Leach's father-in-law owned an educational publishing company. He invested financially in initial production of the Barney concept, and also added Dennis DeShazer, an SMU alumni who worked for him as a video writer and producer. This original creative trio produced a series of home videos called Barney and the Backyard Gang, featuring actress Sandy Duncan, which were sold directly to the public. In 1991, a programming executive with Connecticut Public Television rented a Barney tape for his then 4-year old daughter, and promptly called Leach's company, the Lyons Group, to team up and produce 26 original episodes for PBS. Later that year, production began on a new TV show, entitled Barney & Friends. Each episode had a 30-minute run time and consisted of a group of children imagining a teachable moment or scenario, which Barney would address through song, dance, and storytelling. PBS briefly considered canceling the new series in 1992 after only 6 weeks on air, but ratings revealed the new show to be the network's highest rated children's program so it remained on air and in production. The series was produced by Lyrick Studios, which was later bought by HIT Entertainment.Heffley, Lynne (March 28, 2008). \\"Barney is far from extinct\\". Los Angeles TImes.

They are a significant example of tabby architecture and represent an industrial component of southeastern plantation agriculture. The Tabby Ruins, as they are also known, are located at 3600 Charlie Smith Sr. Highway at Georgia Spur 40, six miles north of St. Marys. The entrance is approximately across the street from the entrance to the Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, on Charlie Smith Highway, at . The historic sugar mill site outside of St. Marys, Georgia in Camden County, Georgia was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 2, 1992.  History  John Houstoun McIntosh marker in McIntosh County, Georgia, USA (not at the Sugarworks) John Houstoun McIntosh Sugarworks historical marker Front side John Houstoun McIntosh began planting in Camden County, Georgia after the War of 1812, when he established a permanent residence at Mariana Plantation on the St. Marys River. In 1819 he purchased two smaller plantations and renamed his holdings New Canaan. Thomas Spalding recommended a sugar mill design to McIntosh in 1825, and John Hamilton Couper stated the McIntosh mill was already in production by 1829. After McIntosh's death in 1836, New Canaan was sold to one Caroline Hallowes in 1840. The Hallowes changed the name of the plantation to Bollingbrook and lived there until after the Civil War. During the war, Colonel Hallowes planted cane and made sugar, and also used the tabby sugar works as a starch factory, producing arrowroot starch in large quantities. For many years it was believed that the \\"tabby ruins\\" were the site of an old Spanish mission.James Vocelle. History of Camden County Georgia. 1914. Other tabby sugarhouses in the area include that at Elizafield Plantation on St. Simons Island.  Sugar production at the McIntosh Sugarworks  Attempts to grow sugar in North America likely began during the early 1700s. Sugar became an economically successful crop in the southern United States by the end of the eighteenth century. Sugarcane was a lucrative crop, especially for large plantations. At that time in the Georgia lowcountry large-scale planting focused on rice, and comparatively sugar required \\"a different growing regimen, but not a different kind of plantation.\\"Mart Stewart. What Nature Suffers to Groe. University of Georgia Press. 2002. For John Houstoun McIntosh, sugar added an additional cash crop to his plantations without adding much additional cost. The processing of the sugar was another story, as the large sugarhouse attests. The construction of the sugarhouse alone required a large amount of materials and labor. Thomas Spalding estimated that one enslaved laborer could take cane from two acres in two months. The enslaved people cut the cane, stripped the leaves, and placed it on flat carts which hauled it to the mills.Thomas Spalding. Observations on the Method of Planting and Cultivating the Sugar Cane in Georgia and South Carolina. Agricultural Society of South Carolina ,1816. For a transcription see E. Merton Coulter. Georgia‚Äôs Disputed Ruins. University of North Carolina Press, 1937. The standing tabby walls of the sugarhouse define a rectangular building with three rooms aligned in a row, and two porches off the central room. The McIntosh sugar mill's three rooms were each used for a separate step of the process, making sugar production there a streamlined operation. The central room had a packed earth floor, while the two end rooms had wooden floors built off the ground supported by the tabby walls. The eastern room contained the mill used to crush the cane to extract the sweet juice, according to Thomas Spalding \\"the first horizontal cane mill worked by cattle power.\\" Horizontal mills were a relatively new innovation in sugar production in the 1820s, and McIntosh's was purchased from the West Point Foundry in New York. The mill room is the only two-story room at the sugarhouse, with the mill being on the second story while the animals which powered it were below.Thomas Hales Eubanks.

In the middle room, the extracted juice was boiled and clarified into a syrup. The syrup was then allowed to crystallize into granules and the molasses was drained off. The middle room had an earthen instead of wooden floor due to the high temperatures and open flame used to boil the syrup. The boiling operation there involved multiple kettles that allowed for the different stages of condensing the juice into syrup.Thomas Hales Eubanks. Intensive Archaeological Testing at the John Houstoun McIntosh Sugarhouse--Camden County, Georgia. Atlanta: State of Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Historic Preservation Section, 1985. In the last room, the syrup was poured into containers where it was allowed to crystallize into granular sugar. The molasses was then poured out of the finished sugar. Both the sugar crystals and molasses were salable goods and the bagasse could be dried and used to fuel the boiling room or used for animal feed.

Led by religious progressives, the leaders of the protesters sought to restore \\"morality\\" in the public sphere. Protests began in response to several actions by the government of North Carolina which was elected into office in 2013 and are characterized by civil disobedience‚Äîspecifically entering the state legislature building to be peacefully arrested. The movement protests many wide-ranging issues under the blanket claim of unfair treatment, discrimination, and adverse effects of government legislation on the citizens of North Carolina. The protests in North Carolina launched a grassroots social justice movement that, in 2014, spread to Georgia and South Carolina, and then to other U.S. states such as Illinois and New Mexico. Background In 2012, North Carolina elected a Republican governor, Pat McCrory, and Republicans were voted into majority in both state houses by the citizens of North Carolina, giving them control of both the legislative and executive branch for the first time since 1870. After taking office, McCrory signed into law a number of bills promoting conservative governance, and the legislature has passed or considered a number of other laws that have generated controversy. The bills signed into law by McCrory and proposed legislation have been the target of ongoing \\"Moral Mondays\\" civil disobedience protests, organized in part by local left wing religious leaders including William Barber, head of the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP. Moral Monday protests in Raleigh, NC on July 15, 2013 Members of the protest movement meet Monday to protest an action by the North Carolina legislature and then enter the legislature building. Once they enter, a number are peacefully arrested each Monday. The protestors are a wide range of mostly left leaning North Carolina citizens, with many religious progressive movements represented. The movement encompasses a broad coalition,\\"The Biggest Liberal Protest Of 2013 In 35 Photos & Video\\", Think Progress, June 28, 2013 including left wing advocates for immigrant rights, LGBT rights, criminal justice, worker's rights, environmental issues and others. Issues =Voting rights= Redistricting and proposed voting rights changes have been a focus of the ongoing protests. North Carolina Republicans benefited from a round of redistricting that was conducted in 2011 and used in the 2012 election. The redistricting process was upheld by a three-member panel of state judges in early July 2013, and is expected to be appealed. 51% of North Carolina voters chose a Democrat for their US house representative, but Republicans won 9 of the 13 seats up for election. The state House passed legislation that would require voters to present government-issued photo identification, provided by the state free of charge,http://www.ncdot.gov/dmv/driver/id/ in order to vote and would repeal same-day voter registration and limit early voting. Legislators also passed \\"Equalize Voter Rights\\", a bill that would revoke the tax credit given to parents if their dependent college student registers to vote at their college/university address. This bill would also require voters to register their vehicles at the same address as their voter registration. The editorial board of The New York Times called this \\"a blatant effort to reduce Democratic voting strength in college towns like Chapel Hill and Durham.\\" McCrory said he would sign a revised version of the bill, which also included provisions that end same-day voter registration, reduce early voting, and end a program that allowed high school students to register to vote before their 18th birthdays. The bill also changed regulations for registration, requiring voters to appear in person or mail in a form 25 days before the election. When asked how preventing students from registering before their 18th birthdays would prevent voter fraud, McCrory said \\"I don't know enough, I'm sorry, I haven't seen that part of the bill.\\" In August 2013 McCrory signed into law the revised bill, which was the subject of renewed protests. North Carolina attorneys Adam Stein and Irv Joyner, along with, and pro bono counsel Kirkland & Ellis and racial justice nonprofit Advancement Project filed a complaint in federal district court on behalf of the North Carolina NAACP and 93-year-old Rosanell Eaton,\\"Court Cases: North Carolina\\" , Advancement Project a North Carolina woman impacted by the new law. Advancement Project co-director Penda Hair called the law, \\"a targeted attack on voting,\\"\\"North Carolina‚Äôs Answer to Lawsuit Offers No Justification for Making It Harder to Vote , Advancement Project, October 21, 2013 charging that the voting changes predominately affect African-American voters, who disproportionately use same-day registration and, during the 2012 election, used early voting at a rate of 70 percent.\\"Lawsuit Against First Discriminatory Voter Law Passed After SCOTUS Shelby Decision Filed\\" , Advancement Project, August 12, 2013 Although a federal judge initially upheld the law, on July 29, 2016, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit unanimously voted to overturn most of the restrictive provisions of the law.\\" Judge Diana Gribbon Motz's opinion for the panel noted, \\"The new provisions target African Americans with almost surgical precision\\" and \\"impose cures for problems that did not exist.\\" Thus, she wrote, \\"the asserted justifications cannot and do not conceal the State's true motivation.\\" On August 31, the Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 on whether to overturn the decision, effectively leaving the Fourth Circuit Appeals Court's decision in place. =Environment= The Moral Mondays movement claims that environmental laws relating to air, water, and soil quality have been weakened by the Republican legislature, as evidenced by the 2014 Dan River coal ash spill; along with this, budgets for environmental agencies have been cut. The boards and commissions tasked with regulation of the environment were all replaced by new members that have links to McCrory and the Republicans currently in power in the General Assembly. A bill to allow hydraulic fracturing (commonly known as fracking) in North Carolina was passed rapidly with little or no public input. =Cuts to social programs= McCrory signed legislation that made North Carolina the 8th state to cut unemployment benefits since the start of the Great Recession. In addition to cutting maximum weekly unemployment benefits by 35%, the legislation reduced the maximum number of weeks of assistance to between 12 and 20, down from 26. This prevented 170,000 North Carolinians from benefiting from federal emergency extended benefits, which required a minimum of 26 weeks of state support. This allowed the state's unemployment fund, which became bankrupt over the course of the recession, to become solvent three years sooner. This move was criticized for weakening the safety net when the state had the nation's 5th highest unemployment, and for passing up federal support. In March 2013, McCrory signed a bill that opted the state out of the expanded Medicaid program of the Affordable Care Act of 2009, which would have provided health care coverage to 500,000 North Carolinians, citing concerns about the sustainability of the program. He has also proposed managing Medicaid accounts, by enrolling patients in managed care programs run by private companies. =Tax changes= Legislators considered legislation that would remove or lower income taxes, making up for the lost revenue with an increased sales tax. McCrory distanced himself from this proposal, which was criticized by Art Pope, his deputy budget director, as being regressive. According to legislative analysts, the reform passed will result in some families, retirees and small business owners seeing a tax hike. All taxpayers have had to pay some additional sales taxes due to expansions of the tax to some services and higher sales tax on electricity. The largest income tax breaks has gone to higher-income earners as it replaced a three-tier progressive income tax with a flat tax. The changes reduced state revenue by $2 billion over 5 years, despite McCrory's previous insistence that any reform had to be revenue- neutral. After earlier predictions of a revenue shortfall because of tax reform, North Carolina instead had a $400 Million revenue surplus for Fiscal Year 2014‚Äì2015, because personal income growth was more robust, and lower tax refunds were paid out due to more accurate payroll withholding. The tax law changes through 2014 resulted in 55 to 60 percent of taxpayers having a tax decrease, 10 to 15 percent seeing no change, and 30 to 35 percent having a tax increase. =Racial Justice Act= McCrory signed into law a bill that repealed the state's Racial Justice Act of 2009, which allowed inmates facing the death penalty to challenge their sentences on the basis of racial discrimination. His predecessor, Bev Perdue, had previously vetoed similar legislation. =Abortion= In early July 2013 the state House unexpectedly attached a number of restrictions on abortion access to a bill described as combating Sharia law. It passed the house less than a day later but was abandoned after protests, and McCrory said he would not sign it without modifications. An amended version of the restrictions were later added to a motorcycle safety bill. This bill was passed by the state Senate, and became a subject of the protests. In July 2013 McCrory signed into law legislation that requires abortion providers to meet the same standards as surgical centers, allows health-care providers to decline to perform abortions, and prohibits public health insurance policies from paying for abortions. Abortion-rights groups criticized McCrory, who had said during his campaign that he would not sign new abortion restrictions.McCrory signs NC abortion bill as protesters hold vigil outside governor¬ís mansion  CharlotteObserver.com After the McCrory administration issued in 2014 the new regulations for abortion clinics required by the law, abortion rights advocates were pleased with the regulation, saying the regulations would not require any clinics to close. The day after McCrory signed the bill, he took a plate of chocolate chip cookies to protesters. They were returned to him with a note saying, \\"Gov. McCrory, we'll take women's health care over cookies!\\" =Public education= As of 2012, the average state teacher in North Carolina earned about $9,500 less than the average public school teacher in the US. The 2013 budget for state teachers did not include raises to base salary. Additionally, the budget phased out tenure for public school teachers by 2018, eliminated future salary increases for teachers who earn master's degrees, and cut $120 million from the budget for teacher assistants. Cuts to education have been one of the issues raised in the protests. =Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act= Since the passage of the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, protests against the act have been ongoing throughout the state of North Carolina.Hundreds block downtown Chapel Hill to protest state‚Äôs HB2 law Protesting their pro-discrimination law in N.C. Protests On the day of the first Moral Monday protest, Rev. Barber drafted a statement for the NC NAACP called \\"Why We Are Here Today,\\"\\"Why We Are Here Today\\", Carolina Justice, April 2013\\"Press Release\\", North Carolina NAACP, April 2013 in which he outlined what was the catalyst for the Moral Monday protests. Rev. Barber wrote: \\"(W)e have no other choice but to assemble in the people's house where these bills are being presented, argued, and voted upon, in hopes that God will move in the hearts of our legislators, as he moved in the heart of Pharaoh to let His people go. Some ask the question, why don't they be quiet? Well, I must remind you, that it has been our collective silence that has quietly opened the city gates to these undemocratic violators of our rights.\\" During that first protest on April 29, 2013, 17 were arrested. As the movement built momentum, more than 900 demonstrators were arrested as part of the Moral Monday movement, and police have estimated weekly attendance at over 2,500. Cited reasons for the protests include legislation recently passed or proposed on changes to Medicaid, changes to voting regulations, school vouchers, tax reform, and abortion. McCrory has criticized the protests as unlawful and a drain on state resources, and has declined to meet with them, later saying \\"outsiders are coming in and they're going to try to do to us what they did to Scott Walker in Wisconsin.\\" The vast majority of attendees are North Carolina residents. Once the legislature finished for 2013, an estimated 10,000 protesters gathered for Mountain Moral Monday at the Buncombe County Courthouse in Asheville. The NAACP and others intended to visit all 13 North Carolina congressional districts. Rev. William Barber, the president of the NAACP's state chapter, said more people needed to register and vote to show their disapproval of state policies. On August 19, 2013 the Moral Monday protests moved to Charlotte when 2,000 people gathered in Marshall Park for one of the city's largest protests. Organizers announced plans to return to Marshall Park and a dozen other sites across North Carolina.\\"Moral Monday protesters rail against Mecklenburg trio\\", by David Perlmutt and Jim Morrill, The Charlotte Observer, August 19, 2013 A section of the crowd from the HK on J protest. On February 8, 2014, Moral Mondays participated in a cumulative protest called HK on J (Historic Thousands on Jones Street), its largest protest to date.\\"What's Next for the Moral Monday Movement?\\", The Nation, March 10, 2014 The protest gathered in the morning around 9:30 at Shaw University and the march began at 10:30. Protesters marched from Shaw University down Wilmington Street then Davie Street and then Fayetteville Street congregating along Fayetteville Street for protest. It is reported that 80,000 people attended the rally, with Raleigh, NC policing saying they granted a permit for up to 30,000 people. Either way, this made it the largest Civil Rights protest in the South since the Selma-to-Montgomery marches in 1965. During 2014, weekly protests took place in Raleigh starting in April. In May, a group staged a sit-in at the office of House Speaker Thom Tillis. Adam O'Neal, Republican mayor of Belhaven, North Carolina, began a 14-day 273-mile walk to Washington, D.C., after Vidant Health closed his town's hospital in July. O'Neal ended up walking to Washington a second time and later walked to Raleigh.  Criminal charges and trials  A total of 924 people were arrested during the 2013 protests in the legislature building. In August, the Wake County District Attorney offered them a deferred prosecution deal under which they would pay $180 in court costs and perform 25 hours of community service in exchange for having their charges dismissed. Fewer than two dozen accepted the deal. Trials for those who refused the deal began on October 4, 2013, with former Wake County district court judges Joy Hamilton and William Lawton appointed by the state to preside over them. Protestors were charged with second-degree trespassing, failure to disperse on command, and posting or displaying signs or placards in violation of legislative building rules. Despite the similarity in the cases, outcomes have significantly varied in different trials. Saladin Muhammad, the first to be tried, was convicted on all counts. In trials on October 11, 2013, all charges were dismissed. William Barber and others were convicted only of trespassing and violating building rules. The failure to disperse charge was dismissed due to lack of evidence that there was a threat of violence associated with the demonstrations. In other trials, the violation of building rules charges were deemed unconstitutional due to the vagueness of the rule regarding signs. Barber and others have announced their intention to appeal. As lower court judges in North Carolina are not required to provide the reasons for their rulings, the reasons for the differences between cases are often unknown. On July 11, 2014 fourteen protestors pleaded guilty to second-degree trespassing, a class three misdemeanor, and received community service but could have the charges taken off their records. Impact In January 2014, the Moral Mondays movement spread to Georgia with the formation of the group Moral Monday Georgia. Leaders of the group announced plans to protest Governor Nathan Deal's decision to reject federal funds for Medicaid expansion. The second rally held at the Georgia state Capitol building, again focusing on Medicaid expansion, resulted in 10 arrests for civil disobedience. January 2014 also saw the formation of the \\"Truthful Tuesday\\" movement in South Carolina. The Moral Mondays movement also spread to Florida, Alabama, Missouri, and Indiana. Rev. Barber has also gone on to do training\\"Moral Monday leader Rev. Dr. William Barber II galvanized us to 'stand in the gap' for justice\\" , Auburn Seminary, October 3, 2014 across the country in how other organizers can learn lessons from North Carolina's Moral Monday movement, including advising in the civil protests surrounding a police shooting death in Ferguson, Mo. In 2016, Governor McCrory lost his bid for re-election to the Democratic candidate, state attorney general Roy Cooper. His defeat was viewed as at least partially a victory for Moral Mondays, which \\"galvanized opposition and drew news media attention with numerous acts of civil disobedience.\\" However, the Republican- dominated legislature retaliated with a law severely limiting the powers of the governor, which Gov. McCrory signed into law before leaving office.

Its main leaders have been Lodovico Pizzati, a former secretary of Venetian Independence (IV), one of the most active Venetist- separatist parties so far, and Gianluca Busato, who came to regional prominence in March 2014 as the main organiser of the plebiscito, an online referendum on independence. History =Background and formation= The committee is part of a long-time effort started in November 2012 with the endorsement by the Regional Council of Veneto of resolution 44/2012 on the self-determination of the Venetian people through a referendum. In April 2013 Stefano Valdegamberi, a regional councillor of the Union of the Centre and later of Popular Future, introduced a bill (342/2013) in order to call a referendum on independence by the end of the year. By 7 June the bill was endorsed by more than 15 regional councillors, sufficient to convene a special session of the Council on the issue. Also several municipal councils endorsed the bill. In June 2013 Pizzati formed a joint separatist cartel with Valdegamberi of Popular Future (FP), Antonio Guadagnini of Veneto State (VS), Fabrizio Comencini of Liga Veneta Repubblica (LVR), other Venetist groups, associations and individuals. Subsequently, on 7 July, Pizzati launched P2013, which has since been endorsed by politicians from different parties, activists, intellectuals, professionals and entrepreneurs. They notably included Franco Rocchetta, founder and early leader of Liga Veneta (and former federal president of Lega Nord), who returned to active politics after virtually 20 years of absence from the political scene. The birth of P2013 caused a rift within IV as some members, led by president Luca Azzano Cantarutti, rejected Pizzati's initiative and formed Let Veneto Decide, which was endorsed by Valdegamberi, VS, LVR, Raixe Venete, Veneto First, Independentist Youth, other Venetist groups and individuals (see article). In October P2013 launched Veneto Business, a platform for separatist entrepreneurs, in partnership with Business for Scotland. =Online referendum on independence= In November P2013 launched Plebiscito.eu, an online referendum to be held in each and every municipality of Veneto on 16 February 2014. The leadership of the initiative was taken by Gianluca Busato, a software entrepreneur and long-time Venetist activist, whose firm powered the digital consultation. The vote, with no official recognition, was later postponed and took place from 16 to 21 March 2014. According to Plebiscito.eu's staff, 2.36 million Venetians (63.2% of all eligible voters) participated in the online referendum and 89.1% of them (that is to say 56.6% of all eligible voters) voted yes. This was enough for P2013 to proclaim Veneto's independence from Italy in Treviso on the night of 21 March. In the poll, ten \\"delegates for independence\\" were elected too: Gianluca Busato was the preferred candidate with 135,306 votes, followed by Stefano Vescovi (48,320), Selena Veronese (46,947), Silvia Gandin (43,025), Lodovico Pizzati (25,731), Gianfranco Favaro (16,670), Raffaele Serafini (16,627), Manuel Carraro (16,627), Gianluca Panto (16,321) and Paolo Bernardini (16,299). Finally, voters were asked to express their opinion on three \\"foreign policy issues\\", where Veneto to become independent: adoption of the Euro (supported by 51.4% of voters), accession to European Union membership (supported by 55.7% of voters) and accession to NATO membership (supported by 64.5% of voters); turnout was however much lower for these three questions (24.6%, 22.3% and 19.8%, respectively). The reliability of these results was contested by a number of analysts, while some pollsters confirmed Venetians' support of independence (see here). =Aftermath of the referendum= The day after the referendum, Busato announced that the separatist process generated by the referendum was to be led by Veneto Yes, which would be transformed \\"from committee for yes to independence to a political organisation which will defend the results obtained with the declaration of independence\\". P2013, whose goal was reached, was basically supplanted by Plebiscito.eu, engaged in the \\"structuring of the Venetian Republic\\", and Veneto Yes. According to Plebiscito.eu, the self-proclaimed \\"Venetian Republic\\" has two \\"legitimate organs\\": the \\"Delegation of Ten\\", comprising the aforementioned elects, and the \\"Treasury\\". The latter was established with the self-styled \\"Decree 2/2014 of the Venetian Republic\\", issued by the Delegation of Ten on 22 April, and was initially composed by Cristiano Zanin (treasurer), Stefano Venturato (counselor), Gianfranco Favaro (counselor) and Lodovico Pizzati (consultant). In September 2014 Plebiscito.eu and the \\"Venetian Republic\\" experienced an internal reshuffle, which brought to the abandonment of leading roles by several founding members of the committee, notably including Pizzati, Zanin, Gianluca Panto, Manuel Carraro and Giovanni Dalla-Valle. The latter, along with Franco Rocchetta and Andrea Arman, distanced from the Venetist organisation over disagreements with the Delegation of Ten. In March 2015 Plebiscito.eu organised an \\"election of the Provisional Parliament of the Venetian Republic\\". A large majority of the elects were VS members.

Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The WMD Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2013 would amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Office of Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) support homeland security-focused intelligence analysis of terrorist actors, their claims, and their plans to conduct attacks involving chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear materials against the nation and of global infectious disease, public health, food, agricultural, and veterinary issues; (2) support homeland security-focused risk analysis and risk assessments of such homeland security hazards by providing relevant quantitative and nonquantitative threat information; (3) leverage homeland security intelligence capabilities and structures to enhance prevention, protection, response, and recovery efforts with respect to a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear attack; and (4) share information and provide tailored analytical support on these threats to state, local, and tribal authorities as well as other national biosecurity and biodefense stakeholders. The bill would also require the Office of Intelligence and Analysis to coordinate with other DHS components, the Intelligence Community, and federal, state, local, and tribal authorities where appropriate and enable such entities to provide recommendations on optimal information sharing mechanisms and on how they can provide information to DHS. It also would direct the Secretary of DHS to report annually on: (1) intelligence and information sharing activities to counter the threat from weapons of mass destruction, and (2) DHS's activities in accordance with relevant intelligence strategies.

The family descended from Sir Henry Gough (died 1774), first baronet, of Edgbaston, whose heir Henry, by his second wife, Barbara, heiress of Reynolds Calthorpe of Eivetham, succeeded in 1788 to the Elvetham estates, and taking the surname of Calthorpe, was created Baron Calthorpe on 15 June 1796. Education Augustus was educated at Harrow from 1845 to 1847 and matriculated at Merton College, Oxford, on 23 February 1848, graduating B.A. in 1851, and proceeding M.A. in 1855. Adult life Gough-Calthorpe devoted himself to sport, agriculture, and the duties of a county magistrate. He lived on family property at Perry Hall, Perry Barr, then in Staffordshire, serving as High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1881. In 1870, he had a French Renaissance style house, Woodlands Vale, built near Ryde on the Isle of Wight; it was designed by Samuel Sanders Teulon. The nearby Calthorpe Road is named after the family. On the death on 26 June 1893 of his eldest brother, Frederick, who was unmarried (his second brother, George, had died unmarried in 1843),thePeerage.com he succeeded to the peerage as sixth baron. He showed generosity in devoting to public purposes much of his property about Birmingham. He made over to the corporation in 1894 the freehold of Calthorpe Park near (now in) that city, which his father had created in 1857, and took much interest in the development of the new Birmingham University. In 1900, he and his only son, Walter (1873‚Äì1906), presented 27¬Ω acres of land, valued at ¬£20,000, for the site of the university buildings, and in 1907 he gave another site, immediately adjacent, of nearly 20 acres, of the estimated value of ¬£15,000, for a private recreation ground for the students. On the family estates at Elvetham he started in 1900 what has become a noted herd of shorthorn cattle, and his Southdown sheep and Berkshire pigs were also famous. =Politics= At the general election of 1880 he stood with Major Frederick Gustavus Burnaby as Conservative candidate for the undivided borough of Birmingham, near which a part of the family estates lay, but was defeated, Philip Henry Muntz, John Bright, and Mr. Joseph Chamberlain being returned. Death He died after a short illness at his London residence at Grosvenor Square on 22 July 1910,Hansard and was buried at Elvetham, after cremation at Golder's Green. Successor He was succeeded in the title by his next brother, Lieut.-general Sir Somerset Gough-Calthorpe, 7th Baron Calthorpe (born 23 January 1831). He married on 22 July 1869 Maud Augusta Louisa Duncombe, youngest daughter of the Hon. Octavius Duncombe, seventh son of Charles Duncombe, 1st Baron Feversham, by whom he had one son, Walter (who predeceased him), and four daughters.

The NFL, along with boxing and professional wrestling (before the latter publicly became known as a \\"fake\\" sport), was a pioneer of sports broadcasting during a time when baseball and college football were more popular than professional football. Due to the NFL understanding television at an earlier time, they were able to surpass Major League Baseball in the 1960s as the most popular sport in the United States. Today, NFL broadcasting contracts are among the most valuable in the world. From infancy to national success NBC was the first major television network to cover an NFL game, when on October 22, 1939, it broadcast a game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Brooklyn Dodgers; the network was still only in its infancy, with only two affiliates, the modern day WRGB (now a CBS affiliate) in Schenectady and W2XBS in New York City. Portions of that game still survive via films, but the film is not footage from the telecast (recordings of television broadcasts did not begin until 1948). The use of a sideline camera, the sole camera used in the 1939 broadcast, would become the standard for all future NFL broadcasts until 2017; the angle is particularly suited for estimating yardage, compared to more mobile camera angles that began to appear in the 21st century. Regular broadcasts of games began after World War II and the first NFL championship to be televised was the 1948 match between the Eagles and Chicago Cardinals. In 1950, the Los Angeles Rams and the Washington Redskins became the first NFL teams to have all of their games‚Äîhome and away‚Äîtelevised. In the same year, other teams made deals to have selected games telecast. The DuMont Network then paid a rights fee of US$75,000 to broadcast the 1951 NFL Championship Game across the entire nation. From 1953 to 1955, DuMont also televised Saturday night NFL games. It was the first time that NFL fixtures were broadcast live, coast-to-coast, in prime time, for the entire season. The broadcasts ended after the 1955 season, when the DuMont Network folded. DuMont was a less than ideal partner for NFL broadcasts: with only eighteen affiliates in 1954, it was dwarfed by the amount of coverage the \\"Big Four\\" (later the East Division of the Canadian Football League) had with its contract on NBC, which had 120 affiliates at the time. By 1955, NBC became the televised home of the NFL Championship Game, paying $100,000 to the league. The 1958 NFL Championship Game played at Yankee Stadium between the Baltimore Colts and the New York Giants went into sudden death overtime. This game, since dubbed the \\"Greatest Game Ever Played,\\" was watched widely throughout the country and is credited with increasing the popularity of professional football in the late 1950s and early 1960s. CBS began to televise selected NFL regular season games in 1956. By 1959, big-market teams such as the Bears and Giants had all their games televised, but small-market ones like the Packers and 49ers still did not. Upon becoming NFL commissioner, Pete Rozelle worked to ensure that every team got all its games on TV. War with the AFL When the rival American Football League (AFL) began in 1960, it signed a 5-year television contract with ABC. This became the first cooperative television plan for professional football, through which the proceeds of the contract were divided equally among member clubs. ABC and the AFL also introduced moving, on-field cameras (as opposed to the fixed midfield cameras of CBS and the NFL), and were the first to have players \\"miked\\" during broadcast games. As the AFL also had players' names stitched on their jerseys, it was easier for both TV viewers and people at the games to tell who was who. As of the 1961 season, CBS held the rights to all but one of the NFL's teams; the Cleveland Browns had a separate contract with Sports Network Incorporated (SNI) to carry their games over a regional network. However, the Browns and SNI were forced to break their deal when the NFL and CBS devised their own revenue sharing plan after CBS agreed to telecast all regular season games for an annual fee of $4.65 million. A special antitrust exemption, the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, was passed in Congress to accommodate the collective contract, which restricted what days the league could televise their games. CBS' fee later increased to $14.1 million per year in 1964, and $18.8 million per year in 1966. With NBC paying the AFL $36 million in 1965 to televise its games, and the intensified battle over college prospects, both leagues negotiated a merger agreement on June 8, 1966. Although they would not officially merge into one combined league until 1970, one of the conditions of the agreement was that the winners of each league's championship game would meet in a contest to determine the \\"world champion of football.\\" The first AFL-NFL World Championship Game was played on January 15, 1967 between the NFL champion Packers and the AFL champion Chiefs. As CBS held the rights to nationally televise NFL games and NBC had the rights to broadcast AFL matches, it was decided that both would cover that first game. The next three AFL-NFL World Championship Games, the initial Super Bowls, were then divided by the two networks: CBS broadcast Super Bowls II and IV while NBC covered III. Post AFL‚ÄìNFL Merger When the AFL and the NFL officially merged in 1970, the combined league divided its teams into the American Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC). It was then decided that CBS would televise all NFC teams (including playoff games) while NBC would be responsible for all AFC teams. For interconference games, CBS would broadcast them if the visiting team was from the NFC, and NBC if the visitors were from the AFC. The two networks had a rotation policy for the Super Bowl. ABC also agreed to televise one regular season game per week on Monday night. ABC aired its first edition of Monday Night Football on September 21, 1970. MNF pushed the limits of football coverage with its halftime highlights segment, occasional banter from Howard Cosell and Don Meredith, and celebrity guests such as John Lennon, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bill Clinton. During its 36-year run on ABC, Monday Night Football consistently ranked among the most popular prime time broadcasts each week during the season. As the league's broadcasters, ABC, CBS, and NBC had their own talent. Announcers such as Cosell, Frank Gifford, and Al Michaels (from ABC); Pat Summerall and John Madden (from CBS); and Curt Gowdy, Dick Enberg, Marv Albert, Jim Simpson, Kyle Rote and Jim Lampley (from NBC), all had their own unique analysis of the game. Individual networks had distinctive innovations in their coverage. For example, CBS' The NFL Today was the first pre-game show to have a female co- host (Phyllis George). On December 20, 1980 NBC made history by broadcasting a game between the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins with no announcers. NBC has also tried one-announcer football when Dick Enberg called the New York Jets' visit to Cleveland Browns on December 12, 1981 without his regular colleague Merlin Olsen in accompaniment. NBC instead pre-recorded interviews with players and coaches from both teams which filled in the parts where Olsen would have spoken. On December 27, 1987, NBC introduced the first female play- by-play football announcer in Gayle Sierens, who partnered with Dave Rowe in a game between the Seattle Seahawks and Kansas City Chiefs; contractual issues with her main employer prevented Sierens from calling any further games for the network, and it would be another 29 seasons before the next female announcer, Beth Mowins, began calling games for both ESPN and CBS in 2017. In 1978, the NFL increased its revenue from both ticket sales and TV by expanding the regular season from 14 games to 16. Furthermore, the playoff format was expanded from 8 teams to 10 teams, enabling the league to give another post- season game each to CBS and NBC. This was partially due to the league's 1976 expansion to 28 teams. Meanwhile, the Super Bowl became a yearly ratings blockbuster, allowing the broadcasting network to generate millions of dollars in advertising revenue. Four of the ten highest rating television broadcasts of all-time (in the U.S.) are Super Bowls.Top 10 Network Telecasts of All Time from Nielsen Media Research When the league signed a new 5-year TV contract with the three networks in 1982, it allowed ABC to enter into the Super Bowl rotation; Super Bowl XIX was ABC's debut. Since then, the network that televises each Super Bowl is determined by the contracts that the league negotiates with all of its broadcasters. Each network broadcaster generally gets one Super Bowl before any received a second. This process repeats before any network airs a third event, although the TV contracts usually expire by that time. Expansion to cable and satellite TV Cable TV became commonplace during the 1980s, and the NFL was eager to exploit that opportunity in 1987. In 1986, the United States Football League, at the time pursuing an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL, signed an agreement with ESPN to carry games on Sunday nights. When the lawsuit failed and the 1986 season was canceled, the NFL swooped in and took the time slot, creating ESPN Sunday Night Football in 1987. ESPN thus became the first cable network to broadcast regular season NFL games. Chris Berman helped redefine the pre- and post-game shows when he launched NFL Countdown and NFL Prime Time, and they have since become the top- rated pre- and post-game shows on television. The cable network's contract to show ESPN Sunday Night Football was one of the turning points in their growth, transforming them from a small cable network to a marketing empire. When ESPN first started televising NFL games in 1987, it only broadcast Sunday night games during the second half of the season. Meanwhile, ABC, CBS, and NBC maintained their rights to Monday Night Football, the NFC, and the AFC, respectively. By 1990, Turner's TNT network started to broadcast Sunday night games for the first half of the season. The combined 1990 contracts with ABC, CBS, ESPN, NBC, and TNT totaled $3.6 billion ($900 million per year), the largest in TV history. One major factor in the increased rights fee was that the league changed the regular season so that all teams would play their 16-game schedule over a 17-week period. ABC was also given the rights to televise the two Saturday games on the opening weekend of the postseason. This was made possible after the league expanded its playoff format to include more teams. TBS had also broadcast the infamous 1982 \\"strike\\" games. The NFLPA called for a players' strike three weeks into that season which reduced it to nine games. In October, two \\"all-star\\" exhibition games were held with generic NFC and AFC teams in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. and aired on TBS. Ratings and attendance at both games was minimal. In 1994, the league signed an exclusivity agreement with the direct broadcast satellite (DBS) service DirecTV to launch NFL Sunday Ticket, a satellite television subscription service that offers every regular season NFL game.  Broadcast realignments  =NFL leaves CBS after 38 years= When contracts were signed in December 1993, CBS (which had been home to NFC games for 38 years) lost their rights to the fledgling Fox Network, and it just so happened that CBS also lost its MLB coverage (which it never recovered) after that same year. Fox offered a then- record $1.58 billion to the NFL over four years, significantly more than the $290 million per year offered by CBS. Fox was only seven years old and had no sports division, but it began building its own coverage by hiring many former CBS personalities such as Summerall and Madden. Fox's NFL rights ownership made the network a major player in American television by attracting many new viewers (and affiliates) and a platform to advertise its other shows. In the meantime, CBS lost several affiliates (mainly owned by New World Communications in NFC markets) to Fox, and ratings for its other offerings languished. CBS lost a number of affiliates, primarily in Atlanta, Detroit, and Milwaukee, where it was dropped to lower-powered UHF affiliates unable to be received in some areas. Due to satellite television, the NFL Sunday Ticket in local markets, and rules of the time, satellite subscribers were required to use antennas to pick up local affiliates. CBS was devastated by the loss of over-the-air availability of these stations in the outer reaches of some markets. Since 1994, the situations in Milwaukee and Atlanta have improved due to committed station ownerships and acquisition of high-profile syndicated programming, along with the digital transition equalizing the field into being received via UHF-only, while CBS's Detroit station continues to struggle for relevancy and exists mainly as an automated pass-through for CBS programming, along with shows from the network's syndication arm, CBS Television Distribution. ABC, NBC, TNT and ESPN renewed their contracts in the meanwhile. TNT was able to get a stipulation that the Atlanta Falcons, based in Turner's home of Atlanta, be featured on TNT once a year, regardless of the previous season's record. =NBC temporarily loses the NFL= Meanwhile, NBC's rebound in the overall ratings in both the 1980s and 1990s after years at the bottom of the ratings were partly attributed to its continuing coverage of the NFL. With television contract re-negotiations in early 1998 ushering in the era of multibillion-dollar broadcasting agreements, an era of pro football broadcasting was about to end. CBS, stung by Fox's surprise bid four years earlier, aggressively sought to reacquire some broadcasting rights. CBS agreed to pay $4 billion over eight years ($500 million per season) to air AFC games. NBC, meanwhile, had indicated a desire to bid for Monday Night Football rights in 1998, but gave up when the financial stakes increased sharply. Thus, after six decades, NBC, the network that had shaped television broadcasts of football, lost its rights, thus marking the beginning of a slow decline for its sports division, culminating in the unproductive 2004‚Äì05 primetime season, when NBC carried no major sporting championships during prime time (NBC had already lost Major League Baseball broadcasting rights in 2000 and National Basketball Association rights in 2002; they had acquired National Hockey League rights in 2004, but that league's entire 2004‚Äì05 season was canceled due to a lockout, and furthermore, it was the least popular of the major leagues at the time). NBC's attempts to replace the NFL with other professional football, including the XFL in 2001 and the Arena Football League coverage from 2003 to 2006, proved to be very unsuccessful. Like CBS before it, NBC would later decide that not having NFL rights did too much damage to its overall ratings to justify foregoing the high rights fees required. The other networks also signed eight-year deals in 1998. Fox extended its NFC deal by agreeing to a $4.4 billion contract ($550 million per season). ABC retained its longtime rights to Monday Night Football by also paying $4.4 billion over eight years. ESPN agreed to a $4.8 billion ($600 million a season) deal to become the sole cable broadcaster of NFL games, marking an end to the league's association with TNT. As with previous TV contracts, the coverage of the Super Bowl was divided between the broadcast networks. Kickoff Game In 2002, the NFL began scheduling a Thursday night special opening \\"Kickoff\\" game, taking place on the Thursday after Labor Day leading into the opening Sunday slate of NFL games. The event includes a pre-game concert and other televised festivities. The first series of these events were held in New York and Washington, D.C., respectively, to celebrate both cities' resilience in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks.NFL Scores: 2007 ‚Äì Super Bowl The 2002 San Francisco 49ers and the New York Giants game was held on September 5 and televised on ESPN. The 2003 edition featured the Washington Redskins hosting the New York Jets on September 4, 2003, and the game was televised by ABC. Since 2006, NBC has televised the Kickoff game (see below). Starting in 2004, the NFL began awarding the opening game to the defending Super Bowl champions as the official start of their title defense. The unfurling of the team's Super Bowl championship banner in their stadium has become a centerpiece of the opening ceremonies. In 2012, the kickoff game between the New York Giants and Dallas Cowboys aired on Wednesday, September 5, to avoid conflict with the final night of the Democratic National Convention in which incumbent president Barack Obama delivered his acceptance speech for the party nomination.NFL.com: NFL season-opener to be held Wednesday, Sept. 5 On two occasions since 2004, the defending Super Bowl champion has not hosted the Kickoff Game: * In 2013, due to a scheduling and parking contract with baseball's Baltimore Orioles, the Baltimore Ravens played the Kickoff Game on the road against the Denver Broncos. * In 2019, the New England Patriots will host the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday Night Football, with the Kickoff Game instead seeing the Chicago Bears host the Green Bay Packers. Financial losses lead to another realignment Recently, the NFL's TV broadcasters have suffered annual financial losses because advertising revenue is unable to keep up with the rising costs of broadcast rights. Nevertheless, the current broadcast contract, which began in 2006, resulted in a sizable increase in total rights fees. Both Fox and CBS renewed their Sunday afternoon broadcast packages through 2011, in both cases with modest increases. Furthermore, the league and DirecTV signed a five-year extension to their exclusivity deal on NFL Sunday Ticket. Despite relatively high, if declining, TV ratings, ABC decided to end its relationship with the NFL after losing significant money on Monday Night Football. In addition to the fees, part of this decision may have been the result of a resurgent ABC prime time entertainment schedule during the 2004‚Äì05 season, particularly on Sunday evening with Desperate Housewives; thus ABC would be unable to satisfy the league's reported preference for a Sunday night game on broadcast television as opposed to Monday. Because of that, Monday Night Football moved from ABC to ESPN, which are both owned by The Walt Disney Company. The cable network paid $1.1 billion per year from 2006 to 2014 for the rights. Unlike the broadcast networks, however, ESPN can generate revenue from subscription sales, in addition to traditional commercial breaks (ESPN's subscriber fees are the highest of any American cable network, more than four times that of second-place TNThttp://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/files/2010/03/cable-sub-fees.png). The cable network's coverage begins at 1:00 p.m. ET with SportsCenter Special Edition: Monday Night Kickoff. The 2009 edition saw the game itself start at 8:30 p.m., with Mike Tirico, Ron Jaworski, and Jon Gruden in the broadcast booths. Meanwhile, NBC, after losing the AFC package to CBS in 1997, was able to reclaim some broadcast rights with a deal worth an average of $650 million per year to air the Sunday night package from 2006 to 2014 (not much more than what ESPN used to pay for the same rights). This new deal included the Super Bowl in 2009 and 2012. NBC's coverage also includes two preseason games (including the annual Hall of Fame Game), the first two Wild Card playoff games of each post-season, and the annual Thursday opening Kickoff Game, similar to ABC's broadcast rights package. The major difference was that the NFL allowed NBC flexibility in selecting games in the latter part of the season. ABC did not have the right to be flexible with their Monday Night Football schedule and picked matchups based on a team's record in the previous season (as NBC does), which often led to teams with losing records playing each other on Monday night later in the season. The moves were intended to break NBC out of its ratings slump; however, at one point in the last decade, this did not happen, and although NBC Sunday Night Football had been (and continues to be) the network's top rated program and in the top 30 for viewing audience, it had not lifted the rest of the schedule. For a time, NBC had been firmly in fourth place and was losing large sums of money, so much so that the network had to cut an hour of prime time programming from its weeknight schedule in favor of The Jay Leno Show, a somewhat lower budget talk show which lasted five months. The network has since slowly come back to second place in the network ratings. Coverage of NBC Sunday Night Football starts at 8:15 p.m. ET with Al Michaels serving as the play-by-play announcer, Cris Collinsworth as color commentator, and Michele Tafoya as the sole sideline reporter. Each telecast begins with a pre-game show airing at 7 p.m. ET entitled Football Night in America, hosted by Liam McHugh. In addition, for the first three years of the contract, the network that carried the Super Bowl also broadcast the Pro Bowl on the Saturday night following the championship game. In 2007, CBS broadcast both games, followed by Fox in 2008, and NBC in 2009. In 2010, the Pro Bowl was played the weekend before the Super Bowl, broadcast by ESPN. The 2010 deal was meant as a one-time situation to protect the Winter Olympics in Vancouver that started the next week (as well as the NBA All-Star Game and the Daytona 500), but the NFL played the 2011 and 2012 games in Honolulu the week before the Super Bowl. The NFL Network was created by the league in 2003 and given a separate package of broadcast games. The eight-game package consisted of prime time games which in 2006 and 2007 began airing from Thanksgiving to the end of the regular season. Five games aired on Thursday nights and three on Saturday nights, the latter beginning Week 15 of the season. Starting in the 2008 season the ratio and dates of the games changed: now there are seven Thursday night games beginning in the first week of November and continuing to Week 16. There is only one Saturday night game, airing during Week 15 or 16 (usually 16, but when Saturday is Christmas Eve, it airs in week 15). The NFL could theoretically decide to sell this package to another network should NFL Network broadcasts not generate enough revenue. NFL Network will also carry several preseason games. The introduction of the NFL Network games also marked the end to late-season Saturday afternoon regular season games on the networks that aired Sunday afternoon games: CBS, Fox and NBC. 2011 and beyond ESPN renewed its contract with the NFL in 2011 which extends to ESPN the NFL broadcast rights through the 2021‚Äì22 season. ESPN increased the purchase price for the eighteen-game package, which will include in 2015 the Pro Bowl.Molloy, Tim and Lucas Shaw (September 8, 2011).

Retrieved December 14, 2011. As for the rest of the changes, they consist of the following: *NFL Network will televise 13 (later increased to 16, then 18) Thursday Night Football games from Week 2 through Week 15 not including the Week 12 Thanksgiving night game on NBC. All teams will play one nationally televised Thursday game during the season and 26 teams (all except the Dallas Cowboys and the Detroit Lions who always play on Thanksgiving, whoever their opponents are in a given year, and the two teams that play in NBC's Thanksgiving game) will appear on the NFL Network's Thursday Night Football. (This stipulation is no longer strictly enforced; in 2017, two of the teams that played on Thanksgiving faced off in the next week's Thursday Night game.) The Kickoff Game does not count towards each team's allotment of one Thursday game per year. *Saturday night was briefly returned to the other networks as a \\"flex night\\" to accommodate holidays and other scheduling conflicts; ESPN used a Saturday game (Falcons at Lions) on December 22, 2012, to avoid playing a game on Christmas Eve as it was forced to do in 2007. It was during that Falcons-Lions game that Detroit's Calvin Johnson set an NFL record for most receiving yards in a season (he finished the season with 1,964 receiving yards). NFL Network later reclaimed Saturday nights as their own in 2017; by 2018, the league was again forced to schedule a game on Christmas Eve night because of this. *Flexible scheduling will begin earlier in the season and will allow games to be shifted between Fox and CBS as well as to NBC. This will also help the mandate all 32 teams will appear on CBS and Fox at least once each year if possible. *Beginning in 2014‚Äì15, NBC will only televise one Wild Card Weekend game, choosing instead to add a divisional round game. The additional wild card game was picked up by ESPN, which, beginning in 2015‚Äì16, will return that game to ABC, returning that network to NFL coverage for the first time in a decade; ESPN will still air the game itself as well. This change also eliminated two issues with the Wild Card game directly relating to syndication of cable games. ** A team that did not appear on Monday Night Football during the season could be playing in the Wild Card game. Since the NFL only sells syndicated packages to teams that play a Monday night game during the season, the logistics selling a sealed bid package of a single playoff game to local television stations on Monday morning for a Saturday game would be improbable. While in 2014, both Carolina and Arizona played on Monday during the season, the stations with the Monday night package were able to air the game in the local markets. ** The logistics of the local rights holder having to clear up to four hours of air time (some of which may have already been sold for infomercials) for the game, and sell all of the local advertising breaks, within a five-day notice also played into the move to an ABC deal. *NBC's Spanish-language channels (originally reported as being over- the-air network Telemundo, but later changed to cable-only mun2) began a Spanish language simulcast of Sunday Night Football. (Prior to this, Telemundo had aired Spanish commentary on the second audio program of the main NBC channel, but not on Telemundo itself.) *NBC Sports Network was originally to begin airing a competing Sunday morning pregame show going against ESPN Sunday NFL Countdown in 2014‚Äì15. (This never materialized, due to the channel's rapid shift in direction toward English soccer by the time of the fall 2014 season and heavy competition from other unofficial NFL preview shows on ESPN, Fox Sports 1 and CBS Sports Network.http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2015/07/20/Media/NFL- Kickoff.aspx#.VazbXkA5Jlk.email) *ESPN will regain exclusive rights to the Pro Bowl, should the game be continued (the league has considered discontinuing the contest), beginning in 2014‚Äì15. Beginning in the 2017‚Äì18 season, this game will also be simulcast on ABC. In addition to that, all of the networks were afforded the rights to stream games on the Internet via the TV Everywhere initiative, but not to mobile devices (as Verizon Wireless, through its NFL Mobile app, maintained exclusive rights to all devices or smaller through the 2017 season); the streaming rights are effective immediately, as NBC and Verizon both carried Super Bowl XLVI online for the first time.

On February 5, 2014, the league announced it had sold off eight weeks of the NFL Network's Thursday Night Football package to CBS, who outbid competitors ABC, Fox, NBC, and Turner Sports. NFL Network will simulcast CBS' Thursday night games from weeks 2 through 8, will continue to carry the Thursday night games from Week 9 onward, and will also carry two Saturday night games (Week 16 doubleheader) for the first time since 2011, with one of those games being simulcast on CBS.Fang, Ken. Thursday night football largely a success. AwfulAnnouncing.com. Retrieved October 27, 2014. All of these games (except for the one NFL Network-only Saturday night game) will be announced by CBS' lead commentating team of Jim Nantz (play-by-play) and Phil Simms (color analyst). The deal with CBS was initially only for the 2014 season, with the league having the option to extend it for an additional season. CBS is paying an additional $275 million for the package. Local CBS affiliates automatically get the local simulcast rights to any game carried only on NFL Network. The league exercised the option to extend its agreement with CBS through the 2015 season. For 2016 and 2017, the league split a ten-game package of Thursday night games between NBC and CBS, with each paying an estimated $225 million per season for five games; CBS's games will be in the early part of the season as before, while NBC's will cover later in the season. Under the terms of NFL Network's retransmission agreements with cable providers, the NFL has included a stipulation requiring seven games in the Thursday Night Football package to be carried solely on NFL Network; for the 2018 season, potential bidders were free to place a bid on a package ranging from anywhere between four and eleven games. Fox, the winning bidder, bought all eleven games that were up for bids. As the eighteen total games involve more time slots than can be accommodated with the fourteen Thursday night time slots (excluding the kickoff, Thanksgiving, and the last week of the season when no Thursday game is played), four of the games are played on days other than Thursdays (usually this involves at least one game in London in a Sunday morning time slot and the remainder on Saturdays, all NFL Network exclusives), or if Christmas lands on a Monday, either a Christmas Eve or Christmas Day game. =Digital rights= Verizon has held rights to carry video simulcasts of NFL games to devices or less since such simulcasts have been viable. The company initially made these telecasts available only to its own wireless service subscribers, even going so far as to block the networks from providing their own feeds to those devices. Beginning in 2018, at the league's behest, it broadened the availability to all devices of that size and offered them through a newly acquired subsidiary, Yahoo! Sports. (Yahoo! has twice carried exclusive NFL games, both based in London, which were available to larger devices as well.) At the same time, Verizon dropped its prohibition on the networks offering the feeds to small devices. Verizon's NFL feeds are limited to Sunday and Monday nights, plus the locally telecast game in the phone's location (determined by the phone's GPS locator); Verizon offers Thursday night games but will only stream those games over a mobile data connection, whereas other games streamed through Verizon can use wi-fi. The Thursday Night Football contract, uniquely among the league's television packages, has a separate digital contract allowing games to be carried freely to all Internet devices since 2016. Twitter carried the 2016 season before being outbid in 2017 by Amazon, who has held the rights since. For the 2017 season it required an Amazon Prime subscription to access the streams; it began offering the streams freely through its gaming-centric streaming service Twitch in 2018.

He survived the reign of Richard III in which several of his relatives were executed in a power struggle after the death of Edward IV. Exiled with Henry Tudor, he participated in Henry's capture of the throne. He was then appointed Lord of the Isle of Wight, the last person to be given that title. An enthusiastic soldier, he has been called \\"the last knight errant\\" because of his devotion to the chivalrous ideal.Wilkins, Christopher, The Last Knight Errant: Edward Woodville and the Age of Chivalry, IB Tauris, 2009. Involved in many military adventures, he was finally killed in an ill- fated personal expedition to Brittany in support of Francis II, Duke of Brittany. Woodville was referred to as Lord Scales after the death of his brother Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, who bequeathed the Scales lands to him. He is consistently referred to as Lord Scales in Spanish and Breton records, but he never officially held the baronial title. Early life Edward was the tenth child, and youngest son, of Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers, and his wife Jacquetta of Luxembourg, who came to prominence when their daughter Elizabeth Woodville married King Edward IV. During the reign of his sister's husband, young Edward Woodville was among those who allegedly encouraged the king's licentious lifestyle as \\"promoters and companions of his vices\\", in the words of the Italian courtier Dominic Mancini.Ross, Charles, Richard III, University of California Press, 1983, p.39. In 1472 he accompanied his brother, Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, to Brittany. Francis II, Duke of Brittany had appealed to Edward IV for support against the French, who were threatening invasion. The king sent 1000 archers with the Woodvilles. Determined Anglo-Breton resistance forced the French to withdraw.Ross, Charles, Edward IV, University of California Press, 1974, p.206. In 1475, Edward IV made him one of the Knights of the Bath. In 1480 Edward was granted control of the town of Portsmouth and the stronghold of Porchester Castle. In 1482, he joined the king's brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester in his invasion of Scotland.Ross, Charles, Richard III, University of California Press, 1983, p.44. Richard made him a knight banneret on 24 July 1482.C. P. Wilkins, \\"Woodville, Sir Edward (d. 1488), soldier and courtier\\", Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press 2011. The following year, he was commissioned to prepare an expeditionary force to be sent to France, but the king's sudden death halted this project. Escape from Richard III After the death of King Edward there was a power-struggle between the Woodvilles and Richard Duke of Gloucester, who had been appointed as Protector of the under-age heir Edward V. The Woodvilles were keen to bypass the protectorate and have Prince Edward crowned quickly. They attempted to outmanoeuvre Richard by placing their large family in positions of power. They convinced the royal council to appoint Edward Woodville as admiral of a fleet, supposedly to deal with the French naval commander Philippe de Cr√®vecoeur, who was attacking English ships in the channel.Horrox, Rosemary, Richard III: A Study of Service, p.90 He seems to have left London to take command of the fleet shortly after Richard initiated his coup by arresting Edward's brother Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, at Stony Stratford. Apparently still unaware of this development, Edward then sailed with his fleet in April. Richard quickly moved to place his supporters in control of key posts in Edward's power-base at the Isle of Wight and Porchester. By mid-May he sought to capture his fleet. Woodville was at Southampton, having just confiscated a large sum in gold coins (allegedly belonging to the king) from a merchant ship, when he was made aware of the situation. Most of his fleet surrendered to Richard, but Woodville escaped with two ships and, probably, the money. He and his men then joined Henry Tudor in exile in Brittany, where he seems to have received a monthly allowance from the Duke. Richard executed Anthony Woodville and proclaimed himself king. He made a number of attempts to extradite the Tudor faction, but the Duke resisted the pressure. Under Henry VII Edward returned to England with Henry in 1485 and fought at the Battle of Bosworth. Under Henry VII he was appointed as Lord of the Isle of Wight in the first year of the new king's reign. He was also given command of Porchester Castle again, along with Carisbrooke Castle.John Duncan Mackie, The Earlier Tudors: 1485‚Äì1558, Oxford University Press, 1952, p.87.Woodville, Bernard, A general history of Hampshire, Virtue, 1861, p.260. By this time he was being called \\"Lord Scales\\", coming from his brother's wife, Elizabeth de Scales, whose lands had been bequeathed to him, but which he never seems to have received. In 1486 Edward went to Spain to join with Ferdinand and Isabella in the attempt to expel the Moors and unify Spain, possibly to fulfil a vow he had made that he would participate in a crusade. He fought at the siege of Loja, where he helped to defeat the Moorish forces by leading an attack to scale the city walls. In the fight, Edward was hit in the face by a rock thrown by a defender. He was knocked unconscious and his front teeth were smashed, a disfigurement he considered a badge of honour. He was visited in hospital by the king and queen, who sympathised with him over the loss of his teeth. According to the chronicler Andr√©s Bern√°ldes he replied, \\"Our Lord, who reared this fabric, has only opened a window to discern more readily what lies within\\".Wilkins, C, The Last Knight Errant, IB Tauris, 2010, p.9. In the following year, back in England, he played an important role in defeating the rebellion of Lambert Simnel, when he was placed in command of the light cavalry, sent north to make first contact with the rebels. His forces repeatedly harassed the rebel army in a series of skirmishes in Sherwood Forest, forcing it to slow down and giving the king time to build up his army before the main battle. He seems to have intentionally adopted the \\"Moorish hit-and-run tactics\\" of the kind he'd seen used effectively in Spain. His cavalry joined the main royal army before the decisive Battle of Stoke, forming its right wing. In the following year he was made a Knight of the Garter. =Death in Brittany= In 1488 the Duke of Brittany appealed to Henry for help when he was once more threatened with invasion by France. Henry attempted to negotiate a settlement, but the French decided to invade. Edward asked Henry to allow him to raise a force to support the Bretons. Henry was unwilling to commit to this, and so Edward collected men from the Isle of Wight on his own authority. He managed to gather a small force of between 400 and 700 archers along with 40 of the local gentry. He sailed to Saint-Malo, plundering a French ship on the way. The Bretons decided to make the English force seem larger by dressing 1,300 of their own men in English colours, possibly to frighten the French with the fearsome reputation of the English longbowmen. At the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier (1488) Edward's force formed the vanguard of the Breton army. He led a bold attack on the French in the opening stages of the battle, but a French counter-attack on the weak Breton centre broke their position and the Bretons were defeated. Lord Scales' force was almost completely wiped out. Supposedly there was one survivor, a boy called Diccon Clarke, who returned to the Isle of Wight to tell the tale.William Henry Davenport Adams, The History, Topography, and Antiquities of the Isle of Wight, Smith, Elder, and Company, 1856. p.32. Edward was killed with his men, apparently after he had refused to surrender for ransom. He was buried in Brittany. In 1988 a monument was erected by Breton nationalists at the site of the battle, which commemorates the English forces, but erroneously refers to their leader as \\"Talbot Earl of Scales\\".\\"English Heritage honore les archers de Wight morts √† Saint-Aubin du Cormier en 1488\\", Agence Bretagne Presse, 11/08/09. The wording, in English followed by French, is ¬´To the 500 English archers who shed their blood under Talbot Earl of Scales; Aux 500 Archers Anglais qui vers√®rent leur sang sous les ordres de Talbot comte de Scales ¬ª. This may derive from confusion caused by the wording of a famous letter written by Joan of Arc in 1429 referring to her victories over the English: \\"Believe what you have heard about the earl of Suffolk, the lord la Pole and his brother, the lord Talbot, the lord Scales, and Sir Fastolf; many more knights and captains than these are defeated.\\" This refers to John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury and Thomas de Scales, 7th Baron Scales (d. 1460) In 2009 English Heritage put up a memorial plaque to him at Carisbrooke castle. Sir Edward's biographer Christopher Wilkins calls him \\"a true hero whose significance in the politics of the period is often overlooked\\", describing him as an \\"essentially Medieval\\" figure, whose actions in Spain, England and France helped form, sometimes contrary to his intentions, modern nation-states. Scales title Edward is consistently referred to as Lord Scales during Henry VII's reign, mostly by continental sources. Richard III did not honour Anthony Woodville's will granting the Scales lands to Edward. Other exiled members of the Tudor group, such as Jasper Tudor, used titles they considered themselves to have been unjustly deprived of by the Yorkist kings. However, there is no record of Edward claiming to be anything other than a knight.Wilkins, p.15 Edward was not officially granted the title by Henry VII when he became king. The minor Woodville relations who had inherited the land were left in possession of it, but without the right to use the baronial title. It is not known whether this was Edward's or Henry's wish. Wilkins believes that Edward chose not to pursue his claim.Wilkins, p.133. Edward nevertheless is consistently called \\"Conde d'Escalas\\" by the Spanish during and after his expedition there, and is called \\"Le Seigneur d'Escales\\" by the French chronicler Jean Molinet. However, when Edward defied Henry's instructions not to become involved in the Franco-Breton war of 1488, Henry wrote to the French king referring to him as \\"Sir Edward Woodville, knight, calling himself Lord of Scales\\".Wilkins, p.183 References External links *Edward Woodville at the Woodville family page *Susan Higginbottom's page on Edward Woodville Category:1488 deaths Edward Category:Knights of the Garter Category:History of the Isle of Wight Category:Year of birth unknown Category:People of the Wars of the Roses Category:Knights banneret of England ","title":"Edward Woodville, Lord Scales"},{"id":"40059788","title":"Wagner Domingos"},{"id":"40059793","title":"1994 Pan American Race Walking Cup"},{"id":"40059815","title":"Finance Ministers of the Faroe Islands"},{"id":"40059837","text":"Woldemariam (Ge'ez: ·ãà·àç·ã∞ ·àõ·à≠·ã´·àù) is a male given name of Ethiopian and Eritrean origin may refer to: *Ambaye Wolde Mariam (1906‚Äì1954, in Keren Eritrea), Ethiopian Foreign Minister in 1953 *Mesfin Woldemariam (born 1930), Ethiopian peace activist and philosopher * Million A.

About 250,000 emigrants from the United States used the trail between the 1830s and 1869 to travel between the U.S. state of Missouri and the Willamette Valley in western Oregon. The Wells Springs segment of the Oregon Trail consists of of wagon ruts bounded on each side by a strip of land. The segment runs from mile point 1,728 on the trail to mile point 1,735; that is from the trail's starting point in Missouri. In addition to the trail segment and the strip, the site includes remnants of a stage station, a pioneer cemetery, and part of upper Wells Spring. The cemetery is one of the largest emigrant cemeteries along the Oregon part of the Oregon Trail. The emigrants' graves are unmarked and uncounted, but the site includes a memorial to Cornelius Gilliam of the Oregon Volunteers, who died by accidental gunshot in the vicinity. The cemetery is protected by a fence, which keeps out sheep and cattle that otherwise graze on leased land on and near the trail. Although it crosses the Boardman Bombing Range, the trail is in a buffer zone not subjected to bombing. Bomb craters near the trail were created by practice bombing runs during World War II, when the range was controlled by the United States Army. The agency in charge of the range in the 21st century is the Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, in the U.S. state of Washington.

The residence was constructed in 1818 by Dr. Richard Thornton, a physician and grandson of William Thornton of Brunswick, a Colonial politician and wealthy land owner. History The Dr. Richard Thornton House was constructed circa 1818 by a wealthy local physician, Richard Thornton. Thornton was born in 1786 to Lt. Francis Thornton of 'Rolling Hill' in Charlotte County, Virginia. By 1810 Thornton had established a medical practice and farm in Halifax County, Virginia. Thornton began construction of the current residence in 1818 with no known significant alterations made to the main house during his lifetime. The house is noted for a peculiar internal division believed to have been created to provide lodging for medical students. By Thornton's death in 1860, the property held nearly 40 slaves and produced the largest quantity of tobacco in the local area. The property was taken over by his nephew Dr. John Lemuel Thornton, and the Thornton heirs sold the property to the Marshall family in 1889. The house remained in the Marshall family until 1983. In 1984 the house and land was sold to the Smith family who hold the land today in a private corporation.

Out of 222 people (218 passengers and 4 crew) on board, around 140 were injured and 79 died. \\"El fallecimiento de una estadounidense eleva a 79 los muertos en el accidente de Santiago\\" RTVE. Retrieved 28 July 2013. The train's data recorder showed that it was travelling at about twice the posted speed limit of when it entered a bend in the rail. The crash was recorded on a track-side camera which shows all thirteen train cars derailing and four overturning. On 28 July 2013, the train's driver, Francisco Jos√© Garz√≥n Amo, was charged with 79 counts of homicide by professional recklessness and an undetermined number of counts of causing injury by professional recklessness. The crash was Spain's worst rail accident in forty years, since a crash near El Cuervo, Seville, in 1972. The Torre del Bierzo crash in 1944 remains the deadliest. Background Spain has one of the world's most extensive high-speed railway (HSR) networks, built and maintained by the state-owned infrastructure company Adif and run by the operator Renfe, which is also a state-owned company which manages the rolling stock. The RENFE Class 730 passenger train is in service on this line, as it can run on both conventional and high-speed tracks. The Class 370 also has two generator cars that allow its electric traction motors to function on non- electrified lines, but which bring its weight per axle well over the normal value for high velocity trains. It is essentially a hybrid system, and is built up of pieces which had not been accredited as a whole. The train has a top speed of when running in diesel mode, and around when running on overhead electrification. Derailment At 20:41 CEST (18:41 UTC) on 24 July 2013, () the passenger train, on an express route from Madrid to Ferrol, derailed on a section of conventional track at the end of the Olmedo-Zamora-Galicia line, at Angrois in Santiago de Compostela. All vehicles the two power cars, their adjacent generator cars (both with diesel tanks) at both ends of the train and the nine intermediate carriages derailed as the train rounded the A Grandeira curve; four cars overturned. A track-side CCTV camera video indicates that the front generator car was the first to leave the rails, followed by the leading passenger coaches, the front power car, the rear generator car and finally the rear power car.\\"Spain train crash: 'I was covered by seats and luggage'\\" BBC. Retrieved 27 July 2013. Three of the carriages were torn apart in the accident and another caught fire due to gaseous leaking diesel fuel. The rear generator car also caught fire. The train was carrying 218 passengers at the time of the crash. Out of the 218 passengers, there were 79 fatalities (at one point reported as 80 due to a misidentification of some body parts) and the remaining 139 were injured. Among the dead there were twelve foreigners: two French, two Italians, two Americans, an Algerian, a Venezuelan, a Brazilian, a Colombian, a Mexican and a Dominican.Las v√≠ctimas del Alvia One of the victims was Spanish journalist Enrique Beotas. The train's two drivers were injured but survived. Reaction The regional government leader, Alberto N√∫√±ez Feij√≥o, remarked, \\"There are bodies lying on the railway track. It's a Dante- esque scene\\". About 320 Spanish national police were dispatched to the scene of the accident. Festivities planned for 25 July, which is a regional holiday, were cancelled. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called an emergency ministerial meeting, saying, \\"I want to express my affection and solidarity with the victims of the terrible train accident in Santiago.\\" On 25 July, Rajoy visited the area and declared three days of national mourning. King Juan Carlos and Queen Sof√≠a visited injured survivors in hospital at Santiago de Compostela. On 9 August, the Spanish government announced that there would be a nationwide review of all railway lines, their signalling and the route knowledge of train drivers. Investigation The Comisi√≥n de Investigaci√≥n de Accidentes Ferroviarios is responsible for the investigation of railway accidents in Spain. A government spokesperson said that all signs pointed to the Santiago de Compostela derailment being an accident and said there was no evidence that terrorism was a factor. Sabotage was also ruled out. Eyewitnesses said the train was travelling at high speed before derailing. This was confirmed by data from the train's black box which revealed that before the start of the curve the train was travelling at , and in spite of the emergency brakes being applied was still travelling at when it derailed four seconds later. In court the train's driver, Garz√≥n Amo, stated that the train was travelling at 180‚Äì190 km/h (111‚Äì118 mph) at the time of the accident. That was more than double the speed limit for that curve, which is . Various media outlets reported that Garz√≥n Amo had, over a year ago, boasted on his personal Facebook page, of the speeds at which his trains would travel. One Facebook posting, reported by Spanish media, attributed to Garz√≥n Amo, stated: \\"It would be amazing to go alongside police and overtake them and trigger off the speed camera\\", accompanied by a photo of a train's speedometer clocking . A follow-up comment attributed to Garz√≥n Amo reads: \\"Ha ha ha, that would be a lovely fine for Renfe.\\" However, these speeds are normal and fully permitted on the high-speed line sections.United States code Title 49 Transportation, section 26105 and European Union directive 96/48 EC, 23 July 1996 The bend where the accident happened is the first curve reached by a Santiago-bound train coming from Ourense after an stretch of high-speed track which is limited to . The high-speed track has ERTMS-compliant signalling, which is designed to slow or stop a train whose driver is ignoring signals or the speed limits. However, the new high-speed line joins a conventional track shared with low-speed trains, at the curve where the accident happened. The conventional track only had the older ASFA signalling system, which will warn drivers if they are exceeding speed limits, but will not automatically slow or stop a speeding train. There is a different system capable of stopping a train if it passes a red signal but that was irrelevant in this case. Part of the ongoing investigation into the incident will focus on whether any of these speed monitoring systems failed and why the originally built-in safety system ETCS/ERTMS had been disconnected. However, the corrective actions taken after the accident indicate that the system as designed did not automatically regulate the train speed to a lower value on leaving the high-speed section, and the required drastic braking was poorly signaled on the track. Garz√≥n Amo was detained pending a criminal investigation, according to a spokeswoman for the Court of Justice of Galicia regional supreme court.Driver detained as investigators probe Spain train crash; dozens hospitalized CNN, 26 July 2013 Garz√≥n told the investigating magistrate, Luis Alaez, that he suffered a \\"lapse of concentration\\" as he approached the curve when the train should have been slowed to 80 km per hour. On 28 July 2013, Garz√≥n Amo was charged with 79 counts of homicide by professional recklessness and an undetermined number of counts of causing injury by professional recklessness, for which he was later sentenced to 4 years' jail. Further charges were brought against safety director Andres Maria Cortabitarte in 2017 for \\"crimes of homicide and injuries through serious negligence\\". Court investigators said that the driver was speaking on the telephone to staff at Renfe about the route to Ferrol, and consulting a map or document, shortly before the brakes were activated and that he did apply the brakes, but not in time to achieve the safe speed limit for the curve. Corrective actions In the immediate aftermath of the accident, the Spanish rail authority Adif installed three ASFA (\\"Automatic Braking and Announcement of Signals\\" in English) balises on 1.9 km of the approach to Santiago de Compostela to enforce speed limits of 160, 60 and 30 km/h, to prevent trains from reaching the 2013 accident point at a speed that would cause a similar derailment. Balises are track-mounted programmable transponders which communicate with the on-board computers on Spanish high- speed trains, and which can cause an automatic brake application if speed restrictions are not obeyed. Adif is reviewing other similar sections of Spain's rail network for possible similar speed-restricting installations.

James Caulfield Early life Caulfield was born in the Vineyard, Clerkenwell, on 11 February 1764. His father was a music engraver, but poor eyesight prevented him following in his footsteps. In Cambridge for the sake of his health, he encountered Christopher Sharpe, a print collector, who gave him some etchings, and money to purchase more. Caulfield became a bidder at Hutchins's sale-room in King Street, Covent Garden. Dealer Backed by his father, Caulfield set up in business as a printseller in a small shop in Old Round Court, Strand. There he was visited by Samuel Johnson and Richard Cosway. In 1784 Caulfield helped out his father, who had been given large quantity of music by John Ashley, to engrave for the Handel commemoration. With the additional capital he moved to larger premises in Castle Street, Leicester Square. About 1795 he moved, this time to 6 Clare Court, Drury Lane; and in 1797 he occupied premises in William Street, Adelphi, and afterwards in 11, Old Compton Street, Soho. The publication of James Granger's Biographical History of England in 1769 had boosted the taste for engraved portraits. In 1814 Caulfield resided in Wells Street, Oxford Street, and until 1820 was mainly occupied in the sale of engravings, the illustration of books, and the compilation of catalogues. In more prosperous times he had received the patronage of notable collectors including Earl Spencer, Charles Towneley, James Bindley, and Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode. Last years With advancing years Caulfield took to drink, earning five shillings a day as a cataloguer, but kept his youngest daughter and her family. One of his sons seems to have entered into the business, as John Caulfield, \\"print and book seller, Little Newport Street, Leicester Square\\". In January 1826 Caulfield broke his kneecap, and was taken to Camden Town and the house of his brother Joseph, a music engraver and piano teacher. Here he remained six weeks, and then went to St Bartholomew's Hospital, where, after ten days he died on 22 April 1826. He was buried in the family vault in Clerkenwell Church. He married Mary Gascoigne, who died in 1816, and by whom he had seven children; four survived him. He had other brothers, among whom was Thomas, a comedian and mimic, of Drury Lane Theatre, who died in America. Works Caulfield's works were: * Caulfield's edition of curious Tracts: the Age and long Life of Thomas Parr, illustrated with seven elegant Prints from the Designs of Anthony Van Assen, London, 1794, a reprint of Taylor the Water Poet's life of Old Parr, 1635. * Portraits, Memoirs, and Characters of remarkable Persons, from the Reign of Edward III to the Revolution; collected from the most authentic accounts extant by J. C., London, 1794‚Äì5, 2 vols. On his own account, Caulfield began in 1788 to engage engravers to carry out this work, and in 1790 the first part appeared. Other parts followed at irregular intervals. Caulfield's \\"remarkable characters\\" include eccentrics and lowlifes. * The Oxford Cabinet [ed. by J. C.], London, 1797. In 1796 Caulfield visited Oxford, and transcribed a manuscript Anecdotes of Extraordinary Persons, mentioned by James Granger and in the Ashmolean Museum. This work added anecdotes from the notes of John Aubrey and others. Edmond Malone then claimed a prior right to the manuscript; Caulfield was refused any further use of it, and the work was stopped when only two numbers had been published. This dispute led to the next work. * An Enquiry into the Conduct of Edmond Malone, Esq., concerning the Manuscript Papers of John Aubrey, F.R.S., in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford [by J.

The verse is supposed to have been written by William Henry Ireland, and the notes supplied by Thomas Coram. Caulfield then shortly published Calcographiana, and denied any connection with Chalcographimania.

It is funded by the state of Hesse and the city of Darmstadt. Its history began in 1711 with a court theatre building. From 1919 it was run as Landestheater Darmstadt. The present theatre was opened in 1972 when the company was named Staatstheater.  History  The theatre dates back more than 300 years. It was originally a court theatre at the residence of the county Darmstadt. At a request by a first theatre building in Darmstadt was opened in 1711 with Christoph Graupner's opera Telemach. About a century later, Louis I, Grand Duke of Hesse, built a court theatre open to the citizens. The architect Georg Moller built a theatre with 2000 seats and advanced stage machinery, opened in 1819. It burnt down in 1871 and was restored in seven years. In 1919 the theatre became a Landestheater. The former building was made the small stage (Kleines Haus). Director Gustav Hartung (1920‚Äì1924 and 1931‚Äì1933) made the theatre famous for premieres of contemporary authors. He was forced to flee by the Nazis. Actress Lilli Palmer, then 20 years old, emigrated to Paris. Both halls of the theatre were destroyed by bombs in the night 11 to 12 September 1944. After the war a provisional stage was found in the Orangerie (de), where the company played for almost three decades. It was known for plays during the times of directors Rudolf Sellner (1951‚Äì1961) and (1961‚Äì1971). The play M√§nnersache by Franz Xaver Kroetz premiered in 1972. In 1966 Maciej ≈Åukaszczyk arrived and worked as a R√©p√©titeur at the Landestheater Darmstadt. In 1970 he founded the Chopin Organisation.  Staatstheater  Great hall Foyer The present building was opened in 1972, when the theatre was named Staatstheater. The theatre is funded by the state of Hesse and the city of Darmstadt. The building was designed by the Darmstadt architect Rolf Prange who had won a national competition in 1963. The great hall (Gro√ües Haus) seats 956 people, the small hall (Kleines Haus), mostly for plays and dance, 482. A chamber theatre (Kammerspiele) seats 120. The Gro√ües Haus was opened on 6 October 1972 with Beethoven's Fidelio, the Kleines Haus a day later with Gaston Salvatore's B√ºchners Tod. Reinhard Febel's opera Morels Erfindung premiered on 6 November 1994. Jan M√ºller-Wieland's chamber opera in one act Die Nachtigall und die Rose was first performed in 1996, Die Versicherung after a play by Peter Weiss in 1999. From 2002 to 2006 the building was restored, with new technical and safety features. It was reopened with Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's Schicksal and L√©lio oder die R√ºckkehr ins Leben by Hector Berlioz on 22 September 2006, and a day later Schiller's Don Karlos. John Dew has been director of the theatre from 2004 till 2014. Since 2014 the intendant is Karsten Wiegand. Music director since 2018 is Daniel Cohen, opera director is Kirsten Uttendorf.

Its collection consists primarily of the artifacts which were excavated from the Necropolis of Monterozzi to the east of the city. It is housed in the Palazzo Vitelleschi. History The Palazzo Vitelleschi was built between 1436 and 1439 for the cardinal of Corneto, the former name of Tarquinia. After the cardinal's death the palace was used as stopover for the popes. Over time the Soderini family became its new owner and it was turned into a hotel. In 1900 it was acquired by the city of Tarquinia, which donated it to the Italian state in 1916. The state intended to use the palace for the current museum, which opened in 1924. It was the result of the merger of the Municipal Collection and the private collection of the counts Bruschi-Falgari. Over the time the collection was enriched by the numerous finds from the ancient city of Tarquinia and the Necropolis of Monterozzi.

On the ground floor the sarcophagi and other stone artifacts from the middle of the fourth century BC are exhibited in chronological order. The most notable sarcophagi which belonged to the most important Tarquinian families are seen in the tenth room. Some of these were carved from Greek marble. The first floor shows the pottery in chronological order, starting with the Villanovan culture. Both the native Etruscan type of pottery called bucchero and imported pottery is on display here. Pottery dated to the Orientalizing period and onward was imported from Ancient Egypt, Phoenicia and Ancient Greece. Among these ceramics was the Bocchoris vase, which dates from the Ancient Egyptian 24th dynasty. Especially pottery from Corinth was imported in large quantities from the end of the seventh to the sixth century BC and imitated by the Etruscans. Some bronze tableware also dates to the Orientalizing period. After this comes the Attic black-figure and red-figure pottery from the fourth century BC, the Classical period. A collection of Etruscan bronze coins is exhibited in the ballroom. In the same room are later gold coins from the Roman Empire which were found at Gravisca, Tarquinia's ancient harbor, and gold jewelry. The first floor ends with a collection of votive offerings.

Anatomic arguments for the tactopoda monophyly include similarities in the anatomies of head, legs, and muscles between the arthropods and the tartigrades. Anatomic arguments against it include that tartigrades lack the kind of circulatory system (including a dorsal heart) which the arthropods and the velvet worms share. Graham Budd argued that the lack of this system in recent tartigrades is due to their miniature size, which makes a complex circulatory system superfluous; thus, the loss of this feature would be a secondary property, acquired as tartigrade stem group turned smaller, and both the Euarthropoda+Onychophora circulatory system and a relatively large size should be a feature of the last common ancestor of all three groups. However, Gregory Edgecombe also invoked phylogenomic evidence in favour of the alternative Euarthropoda+Onychophora grouping.

In early February 1241, Polish forces under the voivode of Krak√≥w W≈Çodzimierz blocked the road towards Krak√≥w, concentrating in the area of Miech√≥w. Meanwhile, Mongol forces headed towards Krak√≥w via Koprzywnica, Wi≈õlica and Skalbmierz, then withdrew to Tursko Wielkie. Following the order of the voivode, the Poles decided to pursue the Mongols. The Mongol commander Baidar was probably aware of it, using mock retreat to find a better position for the battle. According to Jan D≈Çugosz, the first clash ended in a Polish victory and the release of a number of prisoners. The second clash however, resulted in the complete defeat of the Polish knights. One of the reasons for the success of the Mongols' counterattack was that the Polish forces, having captured the Mongol camp, focused on looting it rather than worrying about the still significant enemy forces.  Aftermath  Though the outcome was a decisive Mongol victory, course of the battle is difficult to determine due to the unreliability of the Polish sources and absence of Mongol sources. In all probability, given how they conducted numerous other campaigns, the Mongols may have issued a false retreat and lured the Poles into overconfidence. Then the Mongols struck the Poles when they were disorganized, routed, and slaughtered them.Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan (20150.

Created and introduced by executive producer Bradley Bell in 2013, Wyatt is the previously unknown oldest son of Bill Spencer, Jr. (Don Diamont) and Quinn Fuller (Rena Sofer). In addition to expanding the Spencer family, Wyatt immediately becomes a rival to his half-brother, Liam Spencer (Scott Clifton), for their father's affections and the affections of Liam's longtime love, Hope Logan (Kim Matula). Wyatt is raised by his single mother, Quinn, and becomes accustomed to doing anything to survive. However, it is his relationship with Hope that helps him change for the better. Despite Wyatt trying to live the best life he can, those around him, specifically Liam, consistently throw his past in his face and accuse him of being bad for Hope and bad for businesses. Wyatt and Liam's rivalry continues when he gets involved with Liam's exes, Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer) and Steffy Forrester (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood), and he also gets involved with his father's ex-wife, Katie Logan (Heather Tom).

However, Wyatt's has a \\"dangerous charm.\\" In an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, Brooks said, \\" Wyatt is the type of guy who goes after what he feels, and he doesn‚Äôt care!\\" In this way, he is very much like his father, Bill Spencer (Don Diamont). Wyatt has that \\"bad boy-ness\\" in him. According to Brooks, Wyatt can also be a \\"nice good-natured guy.\\" When compared to the heroic Max on Days, Brooks described Wyatt as being \\"more of a playboy.\\" Wyatt is a very \\"strong stubborn character,\\" and he is willing to \\"take on any challenge -- or he'll at least try to.\\" Brooks compared the character to many of Jack Nicholson's role where he plays a villain, but \\"he's so likeable. You hate him, but you love him.\\"  Development  = Introduction = The character's introduction came on the heels of the announcement that Jacqueline MacInnes Wood, who played Steffy Forrester had decided not to renew her contract and would depart from the series (she later agreed to sign on recurringly). Wood's departure would take away from the show's major romantic triangle featuring the characters of Hope (Kim Matula), Liam (Scott Clifton) and Steffy. Brooks had quite a few meetings with Brad Bell before he booked the role of Wyatt which led the actor to believe that the producers were trying to figure out \\"how and where\\" to fit the character into the canvas. Bell told Brooks that they would figure out the character as the storyline unfolded. Brooks himself suggested that Wyatt be a bit of \\"bad boy,\\" and Bell \\"took it and ran with it.\\" Bell crafted a back- story for the character and presented it to Brooks. Brooks said of the character's introduction, \\"We are sort of piecing it all together as it is unraveling.\\" \\"As the story unfolds, he moves into that whole fashion-industry world and you'll find out his connection to everything\\" Brooks said to Michael Logan. = Paternity reveal = Just five days after it was announced that Brooks had joined the cast, it was also announced that Rena Sofer, known for her portrayal of Lois Cerullo on General Hospital was cast in the role of Wyatt's mother, Quinn Fuller. According to Brooks, Wyatt's world is \\"rocked\\" by the revelation of his paternity. At the time, Wyatt has just \\"poured his heart and soul into pursuing Hope,\\" only for her to reject him for Liam. What hurts the most is that Quinn lied to him about his father. Wyatt views the situation as \\"We've been struggling as hard as we can to get our jewelry business off the ground and you've been keeping a billionaire from my life? This is crazy!\\" He sees the revelation as a potentially good thing. However, when Wyatt learns that Bill gave Quinn money to get an abortion, \\"He's torn between his lying mother and a father who didn't want him in the first place.\\" Had these secrets come out over a period of time, Wyatt may have been able to take them in stride, but because everything comes out at once, Wyatt is left feeling like, \\"Nobody wants me. My parents are heartless liars. I'm related to a wishy-washy guy, and my girl doesn't want me.\\" Though Wyatt initially comes off as a nice guy, Wyatt's reaction to being Bill's son \\"keeps people guessing what is he going to do next?\\" Though Wyatt is able to overlook Bill not wanting him, he clashes with Bill again when after learning he has \\"abandoned\\" his youngest son Will with estranged wife, Katie Logan (Heather Tom). According to Brooks, \\"Wyatt is disappointed to see his new family already coming apart.\\" Wyatt may have gotten \\"overly excited\\" about the idea of a family. And because he sees so much of himself in Bill, it scares him to see what Bill is doing to his other family. Though Bill puts distance between himself and his son for Wyatt's judgement. Of the storyline, Brooks said that Wyatt experiences so many emotions that he doesn't know how to react \\"so he is lashing out.\\" Brooks said, \\" Wyatt has always wanted love from his father, and he feels after all this lost time, he wants to prove himself and be loved.\\" = Feud with Liam and romantic triangle = Wyatt immediately becomes a rival for his brother, Liam Spencer (Scott Clifton) for the affections of Hope Logan (Kim Matula). Brooks said Wyatt's introduction sends Liam \\"reeling with the realization that Hope's heart, may not, in fact, be perpetually on hold for him!\\" Wyatt does not shy away from the challenge of battling Liam for Hope's affection. Of Wyatt's competitive nature with his brother Liam, Brooks said, \\"[Wyatt] has always wanted a love from a brother, but he finds it fun competition for him right now in trying to get the girl! So it‚Äôs kind of power and love at the same time.\\" According to Brooks, challenging Liam is Wyatt's attempt at testing the \\"boundaries\\" to \\"see if Liam is a worthy adversary.\\" Wyatt relishes in \\"getting under Liam's skin,\\" Brooks said of Wyatt convincing Hope to accompany him to Mexico. Besides Hope, Bill seeing so much of himself in Wyatt, also causes tension between the brothers. While Bill considers some of Liam's behavior to be \\"un-Spencer like,\\" but when he meets Wyatt, according to Don Diamont, Bill thinks, \\"Hey, look at this kid, he's great! Built in my own image!\\" Hope and Wyatt's business relationship serves as a catalyst to advance their personal relationship and Liam is very much threatened. Wyatt enjoys to pulling Liam's strings and \\"[giving] him a run for his money.\\" According to Brooks, Wyatt continues \\"turning the knife,\\" in an effort to get a reaction from Liam. Brooks said, that there would always be \\"some kind of sibling rivalry between [Wyatt and Liam] and fighting for someone's affection, whether it's their dad's affection or Hope's affection.\\" Though they are both generally nice guys, Liam's at times comes off as a pushover and \\"Wyatt's hoping that [Liam] does step up to make it a challenge.\\" With tensions high after the paternity revelation, Wyatt thinks he can help Liam by showing him some \\"tough love\\" and forcing him to be a \\"stronger person.\\" In a joint interview with Soap Opera Digest, Brooks and Clifton discussed Wyatt and Liam's dynamic as the feuding brothers. According to Brooks, regardless of any kind of \\"animosity and jealousy\\" between the brothers, there is an \\"underlying love that anybody would have if they were an only sibling and now they have somebody.\\" When asked to describe the relationship, Clifton said jokingly, \\"Liam no like Wyatt.\\" He continued, \\"I would say layered, dialectical, and in some ways paradoxical.\\" Brooks said, \\"Obviously competitive, jealous, but there's also a huge need for a brother's love that they've never had, for both of them.\\" = Relationship with Hope = Wyatt is immediately \\"smitten\\" with Hope explained Brooks. Wyatt has no problem challenging Liam for Hope's affections nor is he put off by her complicated romantic past. Hope initially rejects Wyatt's advances because she is engaged to Liam, but she enjoys the fact that he only has eyes for her, while Liam is consistently torn between her and her stepsister, Steffy Forrester. Later, Kim Matula commented that Hope is \\"super intrigued by this Wyatt guy,\\" so the moment she finds an out with Liam, she takes it. The partnership between Forrester Creations and Quinn Artisan forces the duo to spend more time together and allows them to get closer. According to Brooks, Wyatt legitimately adores Hope. The actor revealed that he intentionally tried to portray the best in Wyatt when he is with Hope. Hope is the only person besides his mother that Wyatt seems to be completely \\"genuine\\" with. Despite claiming he doesn't have an ulterior motive, Wyatt views their business trip to Mexico to see the Hope Diamond as his chance to finally win Hope's affections. The diamond is a \\"Romancing the Stone-type of thing, where [Hope and Wyatt] go off to a foreign land in search of this diamond. It's sexy and it's Latin and it's great,\\" Brooks said of the duo's Mexican adventure.  Storylines  Hope sees the mysterious Wyatt taking a solar shower, and takes his picture. However, he catches her and a chase ensues which leads to her falling and hitting her head. Wyatt is immediately taken with Hope even going so far as to kiss her to wake her up. Wyatt finds Hope's cell phone and returns it to her in Los Angeles where she invites him to accompany her to a 4 July party. Hope's estranged ex, Liam Spencer (Scott Clifton) is unsettled when he finds them together at the party. They share another kiss as Hope spots his sword necklace, which is identical to Liam and his father, Bill (Don Diamont)'s. Thanks to Hope's machinations, Wyatt discovers that Bill is his long lost father and that his mother, Quinn (Rena Sofer) actually designed the original sword necklace. Angry about Quinn's lies, Wyatt moves in with Liam and Bill. However, Wyatt continues pursuing Hope and kisses her again which leads to Liam hitting him. Liam wants to put Wyatt out of the house, but Bill convinces them to try and work through there differences. But when Wyatt berates Bill about abandoning his wife, Katie (Heather Tom) and youngest son, Will, after his affair with Katie's sister and Hope's mother, Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang), Bill disowns Wyatt anyway. Wyatt reconciles with Quinn and moves back in with her. Brooke explains the extenuating circumstances allowing Wyatt to soften toward Bill and has Bill see the situation from Wyatt's perspective. Caroline tells Bill he's treating Wyatt the same way Bill Spencer Sr. treated Bill. Bill eventually accepts Wyatt again and they start to establish a father-son relationship. Hope decides to use Quinn Artisan as the jewelry designer to tie to her fashion line, Hope For the Future and Wyatt continues pursuing Hope. Liam feels threatened and tries to convince Hope to cancel the deal, but Hope decides against it. In October 2013 at Quinn's encouragement, Wyatt takes Hope to Mexico to see the Hope Diamond as he plans to integrate the diamond into the jewelry line. Wyatt tries to get Hope to leave Liam, and be with him, but she refuses. Hope calls off her engagement to Liam after she receives an e-mail with Liam's romantic video of his life with Steffy. Quinn admits to sending the video, and Wyatt eventually comes clean about his mother's interference, and she forgives him for keeping the secret. To impress Hope, Wyatt stages a jewelry heist and manages to disarm actual jewel thieves. Liam convinces Hope that they should get married and pressures her into severing all ties with Wyatt. Abiding by Hope's wishes, Wyatt says goodbye to Hope on her the day of her wedding to Liam as he plans to go to Hawaii. He is however shocked when Hope leaves Liam at the altar after seeing him with Steffy again and travels to Hawaii with him. Liam follows soon after and reveals that Quinn set them up and convinced Steffy to return from Paris after finding out that she can now conceive again but Hope decided to start a relationship with Wyatt putting Liam in her past. However, their happiness is short lived when Liam reveals that Wyatt took the Hope Diamond and it almost ends their relationship but Hope forgave Wyatt and they reunite. Hope then has a pregnancy scare and after months of exclusively dating Wyatt, Liam persuaded Hope to share equal time and make a final decision on who she wants to be with. Wyatt reluctantly agrees. When Ridge goes missing in Abu Dhabi, everyone starts blaming Quinn for it because she send Ridge a selfie email of her and Bill. During a heated argument between Liam and Quinn at Forrester, he calls her a manipulative bitch, Wyatt enters and punches Liam for calling his mother that. Hope realises what happened and becomes upset at Wyatt for punching Liam and leaves with Liam. She feels guilty for bringing Quinn and Wyatt into the company, so she chooses to be with Liam and they kiss. Liam later proposes to Hope, who accepts. Wyatt and Quinn are fired, but later Deacon and Wyatt learn of Quinn's plan to murder Liam. Wyatt saves his brother, and Quinn decides to check herself into a mental health facility, while Liam decides not to press charges. Liam and Wyatt decide to have a brotherly relationship, and at his urging, Hope rehires Wyatt, who will be working with the newly arrived Ivy Forrester. But then, Wyatt learns Ricardo Montemayor died and willed the Hope for the Future Diamond to him. Shocked but saddened by Ricardo's demise, Wyatt uses this opportunity to win Hope back by gifting her with the diamond. He then throws a big press conference, announcing Ricardo's death and his will, and gifts the diamond publicly to Hope, who accepts, much to Liam's chagrin. Wyatt soon learns his mother is back in LA and keeps it a secret. Quinn tells Wyatt she is better and is an outpatient. He warns her to stay away from Liam, and not involve herself in his love life. Soon, Wyatt gets a call from the Mexican police saying they want to interview him about Ricardo's death. Wyatt asks his mom if she killed Ricardo, but she denies it. Later, Wyatt, Rick and Hope all travel to Paris for a photoshoot promoting the diamond. Hope tells Wyatt that Liam will meet her in Paris to marry her after the photoshoot and she will be forced to return the diamond. Wyatt tries to convince her to dump Liam and come back to him, to no avail. Wyatt tells his mother about his troubles, and warns her to stay away from Liam. However, unknown to him, Quinn follows Ivy and Liam to Paris and sabotages Liam's plans to marry Hope by pushing Ivy into the River Seine, forcing Liam to save her. Hope believes Liam decided not to show up, since they argued about Wyatt and the diamond before the photoshoot. Devastated, she accompanies Wyatt on the Spencer jet to Monte Carlo to be on Bill's yacht. Wyatt tells her that Liam has always failed her, but he never will. He then proposes to Hope on the yacht with the HFTF diamond. Hope, realizing that Wyatt is the man she has really wanted all along and that Liam was just a fantasy for her, marries him on the yacht. Liam later finds out from Bill, and is devastated. Hope finds out about Quinn pushing Ivy into the Seine which resulted in Liam being late to meet her. Hope almost ends the marriage to reunite with Liam but finds out she is pregnant with Wyatt's baby. Hope then demands that Wyatt keep Quinn away from her and the baby in future but during a confrontation with Quinn, Hope falls down the steps at the Logan Mansion and has a miscarriage. Blaming Wyatt for not keeping his mother away from her, Hope leaves LA to join her mother in Milan, Italy. Wyatt follows Hope and off screen tries to reconcile with his wife. However, after a period of time Wyatt returns to LA and files for divorce, mutually ending the marriage. Wyatt returns to work at Forrester Creations but after a confrontation with the CEO who is also his former brother in-law, Rick Forrester, Wyatt briefly resigns only to get his job back at Bill and Liam's demand, who are trying to get Rick out of the company and take it over. Wyatt than has a brief relationship with Nicole Avant, who is the younger sister of Maya Avant. The relationship ends when Nicole finds out that Wyatt was only using her to find out what Maya's secret was in order to get her boyfriend, Rick out as CEO. Wyatt than has an attraction toward Steffy Forrester, Liam's ex-wife and they kiss. However nothing comes of it when it is clear that Steffy isn't over Liam. Eventually, Liam chooses Steffy over Ivy, and Ivy and Wyatt enter into a relationship on the rebound, sleeping together and having strong feelings. But Ivy ultimately cheats on Wyatt, kissing Thomas. Wyatt decides to forgive her, but later overhears her admit that she still loves Liam. Wyatt breaks up with her, and she unsuccessfully tries to get back with Liam, only to be rejected and returns to Australia. Later, Liam disappears (he was really kidnapped by Quinn and lost his memory), and Wyatt comforts Steffy, telling her that Liam must have once again let her down. He shows her how to have fun by surfing on the beach and even buys her a motorcycle, which she hasn't driven since her miscarriage. The two fall in love and eventually get married on the beach. The two then get matching wedding band tattoos to symbolise their love for each other. Wyatt began making Steffy the face of Spencer Publications' social media, and promised her that Quinn would no longer be a problem for them. However, Wyatt soon discovers that Quinn had begun an affair with Steffy's grandfather, Eric Forrester. Quinn and Eric were married in September 2016, and Wyatt stood by Steffy and the rest of the Forrester family in boycotting the wedding. Wyatt supports Quinn when she is appointed interim CEO while Eric recovers from a brain aneurysm, caused by an argument he was having with his family over the wedding boycott. During this time, Ridge and Steffy lied to Quinn and the rest if the Forrester family by claiming that Ridge had Eric's power of attorney, when in fact Quinn had it. Ridge's attempt to regain control of Forrester Creations failed and Wyatt told Quinn about Steffy and Ridge's lie. When Steffy finds out that Wyatt had betrayed her trust and that their marriage was based on the lie of Liam's disappearance, Steffy filed for divorce, and returned to Liam. A few weeks before the divorce was due to be finalised, Quinn suggested to Eric that Steffy should be made CEO of Forrester Creations, to which he agrees. Wyatt and Steffy realise that this was part of Quinn's scheme to reunite them, and Wyatt agreed to fast-track the divorce as a result. Wyatt and Steffy both have their wedding band tattoos removed after the finalisation of the divorce, and Wyatt leaves his position at Forrester Creations to return to Spencer Publications. Wyatt did not attend Steffy and Liam's wedding in Australia. When Katie stepped in Wyatt's old PR position at Forrester Creations, Wyatt decided to help her and together they created a fashion event focusing on swimwear to be held during the Forrester/Spectra fashion duel in Monte Carlo. Excited over the success of the show, Katie and Wyatt kissed repeatedly, but Katie was dubious about exploring things with him because of their connections to Bill and Quinn. Katie and Wyatt decided to keep their newfound relationship a secret and to have a no-strings attached relationship. Over time, Katie and Wyatt's relationship is discovered by Eric, Quinn, Brooke, Ridge and Liam. When Wyatt saw Katie kissing Thorne Forrester (Ingo Rademacher), he broke off their no-strings attached relationship and let Katie go. In the time of their separation, Wyatt understood his true feelings for Katie and he proposed to her. Wyatt and Katie got engaged and they prepared themselves to tell the truth to Bill. Bill reacts with anger to the news, threatening Wyatt and Katie to break off the engagement or else he will remove all of Wyatt's family privileges as well as sue for full custody of Will, believing no judge would side with them since Wyatt is engaged to his half-brother's mother.  Reception  \\"The Bold and the Beautiful just added a little more star power to its cast\\" said Daytime Confidential in response to the casting announcement. \\"Liam is gonna crap\\" said Michael Logan in response to the character coming in between Liam and Hope. Michael Fairman said \\"Wowza!\\" in response to the casting and applauded the series for \\"finally\\" expanding the triangle. \\"Well, it‚Äôs about freaking time!\\" said Kambra Clifford in response to the decision to give Hope a love interest besides Liam. According to Brooks, the reaction to Wyatt on social media was initially very mixed. However, his co-star Scott Clifton said the support for Wyatt was very overwhelming due to Liam's checkered past with Hope. TV Source Magazine described Brooks's introduction as \\"memorable.\\" Dan J. Kroll described Wyatt's first appearance as \\"eye-opening.\\" Luke Kerr said the series \\"isn‚Äôt wasting a moment\\" getting Brooks to strip, in reference to Wyatt being naked in his first scene. CBS Soaps In Depth said of the character's introduction: \\"Most men would get slapped for going around planting unsolicited kisses on a girl who is adamantly engaged to someone else, but somehow, Wyatt manages to not only pull it off but also melt our hearts in the process.\\" ABC Soaps In Depth listed Wyatt in their \\"Best & Worst of 2013\\" list as the \\"Coolest Cat.\\" Of the character, the magazine said, \\"we can't help being charmed by Liam's new sibling Wyatt. Although the guy's cockiness easily could have come off as obnoxious, portrayer Darin Brooks instead had us eating out of the palm of his hand!\\" When asked to compare Brooks to Wyatt, Scott Clifton said much like his portrayer, Wyatt has a certain \\"ease\\" when he comes into a new environment. \\"They're very comfortable and it makes you very comfortable around them. Darin brings a lot of that to Wyatt. Wyatt doesn't walk around worried about how people are going to perceive him. That's a cool quality that I wish I had more of, actually.\\" However, Clifton said \\"The arrogance\\" in Wyatt is what sets Brooks apart from his character. Michael Fairman said that Wyatt's vow to never interfere in a marriage makes him \\"a bit more redeemable.\\" Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps described the character of Wyatt as \\"defiant and confident\\" and said the character's introduction as a \\"breath of fresh air into the Liam/Hope relationship.\\" In their \\"Best and Worst of 2013\\" list, On- Air On-Soaps listed the character of Wyatt as the \\"Best New Character, Male.\\"  References  Category:The Bold and the Beautiful characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2013 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Wyatt Spencer"},{"id":"40060429","text":"Odo V was Count of Troyes and of Meaux, including Vitry-le-Fran√ßois, from 1089 to his death, in 1093.Theodore Evergates, The Aristocracy in the County of Champagne, 1100-1300, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007), 7.

They are sometimes classified as a sister group to pareiasaurids (but see Classification). The group includes the genera Macroleter, Bashkyroleter, \\"Bashkyroleter\\" mesensis, Nycteroleter, Emeroleter, and probably Rhipaeosaurus. They were carnivorous, and occasionally ate insects. The group was most common in European Russia, with only a few fossils in North America. One fossil has also been found in Africa, but this is the only one from Gondwana.  Classification  Nycteroleteridae is sometimes considered a sister group to the Pareiasauridae, but Bayesian inference suggests that it was in fact paraphyletic, with Rhipaeosaurus a basal member of the Pareiasauridae and other members of the Nycteroleteridae as outgroups. This is supported by the appearance of Rhipaeosaurus' skull and teeth - it had tricuspid teeth and multiple horns on the skull, resembling a pareiasaur but smaller and with a longer tail. For this reason it is often seen as intermediate between more primitive nycteroleterids and more advanced pareiasaurids such as Scutosaurus.  Features  As discussed above, Nycteroleteridae technically includes all pareiasaurs as well as the five given genera. Within the five genera mentioned, there seems to be a smooth gradient of form from Macroleter to Rhipaeosaurus. Where Macroleter has no horns,Emeroleter has a few small horns, and Rhipaeosaurus' horns are quite large. However, there are some characteristic features of the Nycteroleteridae. They have a deeply incised otic notch, postparietal bones that enter the pineal opening, regular circular pits in the skull, and a row of palatal teeth from the interpterygoid vacuity to the edge of the choana. Examination of the nycteroleterids' middle ear bones and comparison with living amniotes showed that they probably had efficient impedance-matching hearing. This suggests that they may have been active at night or in dim-light environments. They are thought to have been carnivorous or insectivorous, but Rhipaeosaurus may have been an omnivore.

It encourages students to make meaningful connections between themselves, their communities and the global community. Students build upon prior skills and use critical thinking, research skills, creativity, independent and collaborative work to solve authentic, relevant issues facing the modern era. Students employ diverse tools of the 21st-century classroom to broadcast their solutions and positively impact the global community. Goals of mission-based learning * Students approach an authentic issue or concept relevant to their community. * Students make a personal connection to the issue or concept proposed in the mission. * Students develop a solution to the mission using multiple resources available in the 21st-century classroom (e.g. technology, social media, museums, podcasts, texts, etc.) * Students impact their community by publicly broadcasting their solution to the mission. Connections to Common Core & State Standards * Major Shifts * Close Analytical Reading - in order to complete a mission, students will need to have a good understanding of the texts/objects involved in the mission, and that will require analysis and repeated readings/viewing of the text/object. * Providing Evidence - as part of the mission process, students must demonstrate the connections between the texts/objects used in the mission and their solution. * Academic Vocabulary - the mission must connect to the content area and standards which will facilitate student use of content-specific discourse and encourage additional academic vocabulary development. * Short-focus Research - in order to complete a mission, students will need to research issues, conduct interviews, and survey the best methods to broadcast their stances. * Speaking and Listening - an effective mission requires students to observe and gauge problems in their community (listening) present their stances to the class and to the public (speaking). MBL Guide The mission must have students researching an issue or concept that they can relate to and make connections to with objects, texts, films, or other resources. A stance must be made on the issue and a product such as an ad campaign or a narrative =Step 1 - Crafting the mission= # Consider the overarching or essential questions of the lesson or unit you are teaching. Use those questions to develop the mission. # Consider these questions: What outcome do you want for your students? What is it that you want them to take away from the mission? Use the answers to the questions in writing your mission. # Provide as few parameters as possible in order to promote critical thinking, research, and problem-solving skills. Provide encouragement and support to those students who will hesitate or resist such open-ended assignments. # Incorporate a connection to their community, school, and/or culture in order to ensure student engagement and relevant application of skills. # Develop guiding questions that will spark discussion, debate, and thoughts about the subject of your mission. # Create a mission that requires students to participate in activism by finding a solution to the issue presented in the mission and broadcasting their opinions/feelings/solutions to the community affected by the issue. =Step 2 - Deploying the mission= # Start the mission with the guiding questions. Encourage discussion and debate. Record answers in plain view for students. # Practice and model group roles in order to reduce in-fighting and uneven work distribution in groups. # Provide limited scaffolding for students struggling with the mission. Use the following generic guiding questions, but modify them if needed to meet the needs of your students and/or mission: # What common things do you see? # How are you affected by the issue? # What is your message? Now, what is your method of relaying this message? # Stick to your time limit and stress the content over aesthetics. Encourage students to polish missions after the presentation. =Step 3 - Stepping back from the mission= Inquire students about their experience. These are some guiding questions for your class discussion: # What tools did you use? # What problems did you encounter? # Did you have any surprises? # If you had more time, what would you do differently? Have students reflect individually: # What elements of the mission were meaningful to you? # What parts of the mission do you see relevant to your future job experience? # What tools do you want to test out in the future? # What did you contribute to your group?

He also met Sir Edward Garnier who retired from politics in the 2017 General Election in the United Kingdom.http://www.newsday.co.tt/crime_and_court/0,162331.html As Justice Minister he was somewhat controversial, making headlines through unfortunate comments and by proposing that prisoners be allowed conjugal visits at a time when supposed rising crime rates prompted the citizenry to punish prisoners more severely. He was dismissed in September 2012, being one of eleven ministers who were fired by the former government, including his successor at the Ministry of Justice Christlyn Moore, before the leading party lost the September 2015 General Elections. He was criticized at the time by Persad- Bissessar for having allegedly misled the Cabinet over the early proclamation of Section 34 of the Administration of Justice (Indictable Offences) Act; however, British Queen's Counsel Edward Fitzgerald argued during a hearing in the High Court in January 2013 that Volney did not mislead his Cabinet colleagues. He appeared with Persad-Bissessar at a public UNC event in May 2013.

Poetry A collection of fifty of the poems of Ieuan Deulwyn were published in 1909 under the auspices of the Bangor Welsh Manuscripts Society, thanks to Ifor Williams.Ifor Williams, Casgliad o Waith Ieuan Deulwyn, Bangor Welsh MSS Society, 1909 Ieuan Deulwyn belonged to the school of Dafydd ap Gwilym, as did Bedo Brwynllys, Dafydd ab Edmwnd and others. Because they have similar styles, their work is constantly attributed to each other, which makes definitive identification of Ieuan's poetry difficult. Williams used the evidence of multiple manuscripts as a determination of which poems to include in his collection, which may have resulted in some of Deulwyn's poems being excluded, but we are fortunate indeed in the edition that was published, complete with explanatory footnotes, notes about many of the subjects, and indexes of both people and places. Ieuan clings to one metre, the cywydd. There are several types of cywydd, each with strictly defined rules that were well established by Ieuan's time. In the less rigid forms of poetry to which we are accustomed in English, strict rules might seem to result in a staid or dry poetry. But, as Glanmor Williams says, ‚ÄúFar from being fetters which intolerably shackle the poet‚Äôs ability to express himself freely, [the rules of cynghanedd and cywydd] become adornments which add to the power as well as the elegance of the verse‚Äù.Glanmor Williams, Recovery, Reorientation and Reformation, Wales, c.1415-1642, University of Wales Press, 1987, p151 No wonder it took at least nine years to become a master poet! Of course these rules developed around the Welsh language, complicating translation of the poetry into English. One poem that has been translated into English is an elegy for Dafydd Fychan ap Dafydd of Llyn-went, Llanbister, Radnorshire, and his friend Ieuan ap Gruffudd ap Hywel Llwyd of Cloch-faen, Llangurig, Montgomeryshire.Jacob Youde William Lloyd, The History of the Princes, the Lords Marcher and the Ancient Nobility of Powys Fadog, vol. 2, London, 1882, pp 274-6 The friends were slain in an ambush during the reign of Henry VI. Ieuan's best work is considered to be in his love poems, which comprise the majority of his collected works (22 of 50 poems). Williams says that he is ‚Äúabove all a poet of love.‚Äù And George Borrow opines that ‚ÄúIeuan Deulwyn‚Äôs most beautiful production is his cywydd to a birch tree.‚Äù Borrow suggests this might have some relation to the ‚Äúdeulwyn‚Äù part of his name,Clement Shorter, The Works of George Borrow: Wild Wales Cancelled Passages and Other Writings on Wales , Constable & Co. Ltd., 1926, p203 but the word for birch, bedwen, can also mean a symbol of constancy in love. For Ieuan, this quality apparently superseded marriage, as one of his poems, ‚ÄúTo a Cuckold,‚Äù implies. This poem is also described as a ‚Äúpoem to his love who had alienated him after marrying a wealthy churl.‚Äù The expectation that a married woman would remain faithful to her former lover might reveal something about the society in which he lived or perhaps the character of the poet. After all, his teacher was Dafydd ap Gwilym. Deulwyn's poems have the usual romantic references, but his melancholy laments are even better: What of love? What does it matter? Taste is the craving of men. Sweet is thy kiss If the bruise of a strawberry is sweet. As Professor Williams observes, Deulwyn complains about the waiting, the longing, and his aching, like every lover. He knows well how to turn a sweet verse, but understanding the puzzling personality of Gwen is too much for him. Like his skilled teacher, he jokes about the deplorable condition to which he was driven by love, even to the loss of his hair! Deulwyn sometimes borders on what might be considered blasphemy in other ages. In praise of the generosity of Sion ap Dafydd of Llysnewydd, he says in his elegy: ‚ÄúIf he is in his [Sion‚Äôs] home, God will not be without a drink of wine.‚Äù ‚ÄúDo not be so treacherous‚Äù writes a later copyist in the margin, but Deulwyn says, ‚ÄúHis treatment of his guests made a saint of Sion‚Äôs soul.‚Äù In his elegy to Sir Richard Herbert, Ieuan compares the sorrow at the news of his death to the crucifixion of Christ, and the betrayal at Banbury as exceeded only by the betrayal of God. Similarly, in his elegy to Dafydd Fychan and Ieuan ap Gruffydd: ‚ÄúAs Mary mourned, beneath the cross, her son‚Äôs fell wounds, so I their loss.‚Äù His poems of praise are loaded with genealogy, ‚Äúuntil they bore the poet,‚Äù but they are a treat for the historian and genealogist. The subjects of these poems are generally the heroes of the Wars of the Roses. He was a contemporary of Lewys Glyn Cothi, and they frequently wrote of the same people, with the benefit that one poet often supplements the other in clarifying relations of local families. Although Ieuan, like Lewys, was able to flatter his patrons, he was unfortunate enough to anger two who were worthy of reconciliation. And indeed he humbles himself in seeking that reconciliation. At the same time this presents a perfect opportunity for him to paint a picture of the slanderer: Fortunately the poet was successful enough in his work to have his poetry survive the ravages of time. Origins Ieuan was from Pendeulwyn in Llangynnwr parish in the Welshry of Cydweli (Kidwelly) commote in Carmarthenshire. From this place he took his penname. While Ieuan Deulwyn has become the standardized version of the poet's name, his name appears in the copies of his poetry in various forms, including Ieuan Deulwyn, Ieuan Daylwyn, Ieuan Deylwyn, and Evan o Dewlwyn. In pedigrees his name appears as ‚ÄúEvan Daylwyn thelder,‚Äù ‚ÄúDuyland als. tobushe,‚Äù and ‚Äúdwyland to bushe,‚Äù,College of Arms MSS D.13, 142 and I.C.B., f 84. Note that in one line in MS D.13, 142 he is erroneously identified as Meredith.‚Äú Paul Bush, The Last Rector of Edington and First Bishop of Bristol‚Äù in Wiltshire Notes and Queries, September and December, 1902 the latter designations derived from the English translation of deulwyn, i.e. two bush. It is emphasized in the pedigrees because at least one of Ieuan's sons adopted the surname Bush on establishing himself in England, and it was this branch of the family that sought out the heralds to establish the pedigree. Ancestors In the 16th century John Bushe of Dilton, Wiltshire, came to the Clarenceux King of Arms, probably William Harvey, and required of him to search his records to identify how he [John] was descended of ‚Äúdwyland to bushe‚Äù.College of Arms I.C.B. f 84. See ‚ÄúPaul Bush‚Äù, op. cit. p152 The Clarenceux discovered that John Bushe was the son and heir of John Bushe, the son and heir of William Bushe and his wife (a daughter of Strange of Gloucester), which William Bushe was son and heir to ‚Äúdwyland to bushe‚Äù of the county of Carmarthen, who married Cecily, daughter of ‚ÄúThos. Ryde (Thomas Rede) of Rodes Court by Talcarne‚Äù in the county of Carmarthen. That ‚Äúdwyland to bushe,‚Äù is Ieuan Deulwyn is made clear by another manuscript that equates the Bushe and Daylwyn pedigrees.College of Arms D.13, 142. See ‚ÄúPaul Bush‚Äù, op. cit. p152. See also, F.W. Weaver, The Visitations of the County of Somerset , Exeter, ‚ÄúDaylwyn‚Äù This pedigree identifies Ieuan as ‚ÄúEvan Daylwyn theelder,‚Äù son of David Daylwyn, son of John, son of Gryffith, son of Meredith, son of Gruffith, son of Cadwgan Fychan, son of Cadwgan Fawr. This Cadwgan Fawr was born about AD 1200,Peter C. Bartrum, Welsh Genealogies, AD300-1400, University of Wales Press 1974, ‚ÄúLlywelyn ap Gwrgan 1‚Äù and ‚Äúhad the house of‚Äù Maenor Cadwgan, one of the commotes in the Welshry of the Lordship of Kidwelly in medieval times.J.E. Lloyd, ‚Äò‚ÄôA History of Carmarthenshire‚Äô‚Äô, Cardiff, 1935, pp227-8 Ieuan's ancestry can be traced even further back since Cadwgan Fawr was a descendant of the tribal patriarch Llywelyn ap Gwrgan, whose paternal line traces back to the 6th-century Pliws ‚ÄúHen‚Äù, king of Dyfed.Bartrum, Welsh Genealogies, op. cit., ‚Äú Pliws Hen‚Äù Descendants Ieuan Deulwyn and his wife Cecily Rede had at least four children: Ieuan (John) the younger, William, Thomas and Elen. =Ieuan the younger= Ieuan the younger might be John Bushe, a 15th-century wool merchant in Northleach, Gloucestershire. His merchant's mark contains a clear ‚Äú2B‚Äù designation,C.T. Davis, The Monumental Brasses of Gloucestershire, London, 1899, p136 and his descendants are associated with some of the same families as William's descendants.G.J. Kidston, A History of the Manor of Hazelbury, London, 1936, e.g., Ashley, Bamfylde, Hungerford, Strangeways =William Bushe= William's line is the one identified in the pedigrees. His descendants include such notable figures as Paul Bush, first Protestant bishop of Bristol, Charles Kendal Bushe, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench for Ireland,Edith Somerville, An Incorruptible Irishman, Houghton Mifflin, 1932, chapter 1 Admiral Sir John Bush (Royal Navy officer), and the current monarch of Great Britain. That the name is Elizabeth is clarified by Gervase Bushe in his entry at June Ferguson's Royal Genealogy Page =Elen ferch Ieuan Deulwyn= Elen married Hywel ap Maredudd of Cromlech, Llanfechell, Anglesey, and a fairly extensive list of at least one line of her descendants is documented.J.E. Griffith, Pedigrees of Anglesey and Carnarvonshire Families, W.K. Morton, 1914, p356 =Thomas ap Ieuan Deulwyn and others= Thomas ap John Dylwyn appears as a witness to a 1490 deed in Brecon,Edward Owen, A Catalogue of Manuscripts Relating to Wales in the British Museum, London, 1908, p590 although no more is known of him. Other descendants of Ieuan Deulwyn remained in Carmarthenshire, as evidenced by a 1609 survey of freeholders in the Welshry of Kidwelly.‚ÄùRees ap Edmund et David Gryffith John pro terra Jeuan Dailwn‚Äù, Kidwelly Welshry Life Given the dates of his poetry and the dates of birth of his children it is most likely he was born at some date between 1425 and 1435 and died around 1490, but no exact dates are recorded. Ieuan Deulwyn is seven generations removed from Cadwgan Fawr who was born about 1200. He had grandchildren born in the 1480s, and possibly some as early as the 1450s,Seven children are named in the 21 June 1477 will of John Bush of North Leach, Gloucestershire, PROB 11/6/419 which puts Ieuan's birth in the early part of the 15th century. As a descendant of Cadwgan Fawr, Ieuan was a distant cousin to his neighbour Gruffydd Dwnn,Bartrum, Welsh Genealogies, op. cit., ‚ÄúLlewelyn ap Gwrgan 2‚Äù with whom he may have served in the French Wars in the first half of the 15th century.H.T. Evans, Wales and the Wars of the Roses, Cambridge 1915, p51 n4 Howell Evans attributes poetry written to the Welsh hero Mathew Gough to Ieuan Deulwyn.H.T. Evans, Wales and the Wars of the Roses, Cambridge 1915, p50 No such poem appears in Williams‚Äô collection, but if Ieuan did write a poem during the lifetime of Mathew Gough, it would date his earliest poetry prior to 1450. Ieuan Deulwyn's name appears in a 1460 commission attributed to Edward IV to look into the lineage of the Herberts, in which the poet is said to be one of the four 'cheyffest men of skill within the provynce of Sowth Wallys,' presumably in regard to genealogy. However, Sir Samuel Meyrick demonstrates that the commission is spurious.Samuel Rush Meyrick, The Heraldic Visitations of Wales by Lewys Dwnn, vol I, Plwyf Bereudeth Sir Benfro, p196 n16 Professor Ifor Williams suggests his poetry dates between about 1466 and 1488, with the latter date being ‚Äúquestionable.‚Äù He is said to have presided at the Glamorgan Gorsedd in 1480, although that is also questioned. In any case Ieuan is generally believed to have died no later than 1500. He lived and wrote, then, during the Wars of the Roses. He is styled a ‚Äúfervent supporter to the men of York‚Äù by his editor, Ifor Williams, but a closer look at the subjects of his poems reveals that his devotion is more to family and country than to a political faction. He criticized Bedo Brwynllys for playing it both ways with regards to the political factions, yet Ieuan himself composed poetry for both Lancastrians and Yorkists, as can be seen graphically in the accompanying figure. The boxes identify subjects of Ieuan's poetry. The red roses identify people who supported the House of Lancaster (Tudors), and the white roses identify people who supported the House of York (Herberts). As Evans writes, referring to the bards of the 15th century: ‚ÄúThey sing the glory of a Tudor or a Herbert according as each rises to eminence, and bids fair to become a national leader. Nor can it be said that they exposed themselves to a charge of apostasy if their panegyrics thus alternated between the one and the other. They were consistent in their nationalism.‚Äù.Herbert, Wales and the Wars of the Roses, op. cit., p10 This nationalism took the form of opposition to the English, or the Saxon, as the Welsh referred to them. Indicative is his appeal to Sir Richard Herbert to ‚Äúlock the door of privilege against the Saxon‚Äù. In his poem, \\"I Ferch a'i Gwallt\\" (To a Woman and Her Hair), Ieuan suggests half- jokingly, that his love should not love him more than a ‚Äúdeceitful Englishman.‚Äù And in his elegy to Sir Richard Herbert, Ieuan refers to the English as the children of Alis, which the Reverend Ellis notes means the children of Hell.T.G. Jones, ‚ÄúWelsh Proverbs, Triads and Truisms‚Äù in Collections Historical & Archaeological Relating to Montgomeryshire, and its Borders, Vol. XIII, London, 1880, p325 Sir Richard Herbert of Coldbrook, near Abergavenny, was Ieuan's principal patron, but he was in the homes of many of the most influential figures in South Wales. Although not of the stature of his cousins, the Dwnns, Ieuan Deulwyn was not a poor man. The 1609 freeholder survey in Kidwelly confirms that he had property that passed through several generations. His son William was a gentleman and his daughter Elen married well. In marrying Cecily Rede, Ieuan himself married a woman of ‚Äúone of the most notable of burghal families‚Äù.Ralph A. Griffiths, Sir Rhys ap Thomas and His Family, Cardiff, 1993, p13 In ‚ÄúI Ferch a‚Äôi Gwallt‚Äù Ieuan praises ‚Äúthe girl I am going to ask for myself as a gift,‚Äù which may refer to Cecily. He alludes to the stature of her family: Her father is like Hu Gadarn [a figure from the Mabinogion]; Great is his concern about a husband for his daughter. He will never give her in a red-gold girdle To anyone except the same kind of gold. He expresses some reservations: I do not go to ask for my lady For fear of these [her notable family]. But then, he exclaims: Seize me; contemn me! My request for her was right. Cecily Rede certainly did come from a notable family. Her father was Thomas Rede, a merchant who was connected with some of the most influential families in South Wales, and her mother (or at least step-mother), was Elen, daughter of the powerful Gruffudd ap Nicholas. Ieuan's death is undocumented. There is some evidence he wrote a poem as late as 1488, but that date is questioned. He is named with Dafydd Nanmor in an elegy of Dafydd ab Edmwnd by Tudur Aled as if the three died at about the same time, which is believed to be about 1490.Dafydd Nanmor, Welsh Biography Online Yet among his collected works there is no poem about the decisive Battle of Bosworth, which took place in 1485. His wife's cousin, Sir Rhys ap Thomas, played an important role in the battle, which led to him being knighted on the field. Ieuan knew Rhys ap Thomas well, and sang his praises, but there is no mention of his exploits at Bosworth. It is possible Ieuan was dead before the battle took place.

Background A native of Baton Rouge, Spencer was married in 1917 in an Episcopal ceremony to the former Rosa Vertner Sevier (1891‚Äì1978), originally from Kosciusko, Mississippi.Vicksburg Evening Post, February 2, 1978 Rosa was a great-great-granddaughter of John Sevier, a fighter in the American Revolution, an early governor of Tennessee, and the namesake of Sevierville in Sevier County in eastern Tennessee. Her cousins were Louisiana State Senator Andrew L. Sevier, whose tenure extended from 1932 until his death in office in 1962, and Henry Clay Sevier, who followed her husband in the state House seat from Madison Parish and served from 1936 to 1952. Mason and Rosa Spencer had a child who died at birth and then a son, George Spencer (1925‚Äì1982), a World War II veteran who died in New Orleans.Vicksburg Evening Post, August 15, 1982 In 1914, Spencer's twin sister, Bessie, married Carneal Goldman, Jr., a wealthy planter in Waterproof in Tensas Parish to the south of Madison Parish.\\"Spencer-Goldman Wedding Announcement\\", Tensas Gazette, June 19 and 26, 1914 Spencer himself was a United States Army lieutenant in World War I. Political career Spencer had been a strong critic of the administration of his fellow Democrat, Governor Huey Pierce Long, Jr. He had worked with other representatives, including Cecil Morgan of Shreveport and Ralph Norman Bauer of Franklin, to secure impeachment charges against Long, which were blocked in the state senate. Long vowed to break the back of what was called the \\"Old Order\\" or sometimes the \\"Bourbons\\", the delta cotton planters, the sugar growers of South Louisiana, and the New Orleans city machine. In the wrangling over impeachment, Spencer addressed the House in a whisper, with his words \\"In the name of decency and common justice!\\", calling for a revote on adjournment which was rejected by Speaker John B. Fournet. In April 1935, Spencer predicted that Long, by then no longer governor but a U.S. Senator, would soon die violently in the Louisiana State Capitol; in September, Long was assassinated while on business in the capitol. Specifically, Spencer had prophesied, \\"I can see blood on the polished floor of this Capitol\\" if a certain bill that he opposed were passed. Spencer was in the capitol on the Sunday night Long was shot and had been seen conversing with the senator earlier in the day. It is unclear why Long was speaking with Spencer because the two were intraparty rivals who seemed unable to reach consensus. Spencer did not seek a third term in the state House but instead ran for governor. In his gubernatorial announcement in September 1935, some three weeks after Long's death, Spencer declared: > I am not a candidate of any machine or political organization. Consequently, > I will not attempt to build up any machine nor will I permit it to be done. > I will see to it that the dictatorial laws on the books are repealed and > that the right of local self-government will be restored to the people. .. I > pledge to restore peace and harmony to our state ...\\"Rep. Mason Spencer to > run for governor; Favors repeal of dictatorial laws, Tuscaloosa News, > Tuscaloosa, Alabama, September 25, 1935, p. 1 In his gubernatorial bid, Spencer said that his supporters would all be \\"white Democrats\\", as virtually no blacks then voted in the Louisiana Democratic primaries. He also endorsed the reelection to a second term in 1936 of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt though the national campaign had not yet begun at that time. At the time there was much voter sympathy in Louisiana for the pro-Long faction just a few months after Long's assassination. Spencer withdrew and endorsed the anti-Long factional candidate, Cleveland Dear of Alexandria,Vicksburg Evening Post, June 13, 1962 but victory went to the Longite choice, Richard Leche of New Orleans, with Earl Kemp Long for lieutenant governor. Spencer still polled nearly two thousand votes because his withdrawal came too late to remove his name from the ballot.Louisiana Secretary of State, Primary election returns, January 21, 1936 Instead Spencer continued his law practice in Tallulah. In 1932, Spencer, a sportsman armed with a hunting permit, shot a rare ivory-billed woodpecker along the Tensas River on a large tract of swamp forest land owned by the Singer Sewing Company. He killed the bird to prove to Department of Wildlife and Fisheries that the creature existed in Madison Parish. As this particular woodpecker faced ultimate extinction, possibly as early as 1938, the Audubon Society persuaded U.S. Senator Allen J. Ellender, Huey Long's permanent successor, to work for the establishment of the proposed Tensas Swamp National Park to preserve sixty thousand acres of Singer-owned lands. Ellender's bill died in committee, but in 1998, Congress established the Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge. In 1940, Spencer was an at-large delegate to the Democratic National Convention which nominated the Franklin Roosevelt to a third term, with Henry A. Wallace for vice president. His fellow delegates included newly inaugurated Governor Sam Houston Jones, a leader of the anti-Long faction, and U.S. Representative Charles E. McKenzie of Louisiana's 5th congressional district. The Spencers and their son are interred at Silver Cross Cemetery in Tallulah.

It is one of the 11 acute care hospitals of NYC Health + Hospitals, a public benefit corporation of the city. The current structure opened in 1957, assuming the operations of the former City Hospital, founded in 1832 on Roosevelt Island. It was renovated in the 1990s. Elmhurst Hospital Center has frequently suffered from equipment shortages because of its small capacity relative to its catchment area, which includes nearly a million people in northwestern Queens. This led to several incidents, including in March 2020 when Elmhurst Hospital became the \\"center of the center\\" of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York state, itself an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Description  The Elmhurst Hospital Center has 545 beds and occupies a triangular block bounded by Broadway to the southwest, Baxter Avenue to the southeast, and 41st Avenue on the north. Previously, it contained 600 beds, most in clusters of up to six rooms that each shared a single bathroom. There are two wings: the \\"A\\" wing running northeast on Baxter Avenue and the \\"B\\" wing running northwest on Broadway. The parking garage to the west of the main hospital contains 600 spaces and was opened in 1993 at a cost of $13 million. When completed, it was privately owned, unlike the garages at most public hospitals in New York City. This is because Ridgemont Parking Structures, the original contractor, planned to turn ownership over to the city when the garage was completed; when Ridgemont went bankrupt, the parking structure was completed by private investors. The bus route runs along Broadway on the southwest side of the hospital. The closest New York City Subway stations are the Jackson Heights‚ÄìRoosevelt Avenue/74th Street station and the Elmhurst Avenue station.  Service area  Elmhurst Hospital, located in Northwest Queens, predominantly serves neighborhoods in northwest, west-central, and western Queens, mostly the area west of Interstate 678 and north of Atlantic Avenue, except for Middle Village, Rego Park, Forest Hills, and Kew Gardens. The areas served by Elmhurst Hospital include Astoria, Long Island City, Sunnyside, Woodside, Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, Corona, East Elmhurst, Maspeth, Glendale, Ridgewood, Woodhaven, and Richmond Hill, as well as part of downtown Flushing. As of 2016, over 59 percent of the catchment area identifies as Hispanic or Latino. Of the remainder, 19 percent identifies as Asian or Pacific Islander, 11 percent identifies as White, 8 percent identifies as Black, and 3 percent identify as some other race. Much of the population is foreign-born and low income.  History  The hospital traces its history back to City Hospital, an institution founded in 1832 on present- day Roosevelt Island. City Hospital was the second-oldest public hospital in the city and primarily served the poor. It stopped operating in 1957 but remains standing. = 20th century = The City Hospital facility was relocated to the Elmhurst neighborhood of northwestern Queens in 1957, and renamed Elmhurst Hospital. The hospital initially was known as the Elmhurst General Hospital when it opened on March 18, 1957. The opening of the psychiatric ward was delayed due to a lack of staff. At the time of Elmhurst Hospital's opening, there was a shortage of ambulances across Queens, so in June 1957, two ambulances were delivered to the hospital for its emergency service. The two emergency-service ambulances started operating in August 1957, and a third ambulance was set to be activated later that year, when the hospital's psychiatric ward was scheduled to open. The psychiatric ward did not open until April 1958, and even then, most psychiatric patients in Elmhurst Hospital's catchment area were initially sent to Kings County Hospital Center because of limited capacity at Elmhurst Hospital. In the first three months of operation, Elmhurst Hospital's psychiatric ward served only 64 patients, who were housed in two wards with 12 beds each. In 1975, a \\"language bank\\" was founded at Elmhurst Hospital, with 50 to 60 interpreters providing service in over 20 languages spoken by the 700,000 people in the hospital's catchment area. Prior to the founding of the \\"language bank\\", services in languages other than English was limited and haphazard, and were dependent on whether a medical staff member spoke the language. By the late 1970s, Elmhurst Hospital was experiencing shortages of nurses and intensive care beds. The shortage led to the deaths of three patients who were connected to respirators, which in turn prompted a homicide investigation, though doctors and administrators identified the lack of nurses and beds as the cause of the deaths. This prompted the hospital to hire 50 extra nurses in 1978. At the time, Elmhurst Hospital accommodated 20,000 patients per year. A renovation of Elmhurst Hospital started in 1989. The project involved modernizing equipment and extending the available space on the upper five floors of the \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" wings. Originally slated to cost $200 million and be completed in 1994, it was delayed by two years, with the cost rising by $50 million. The delays were attributed to the difficulty in moving medical labs and nursing stations; challenges in building the parking deck; the bankruptcy of a major contractor; strike actions that occurred after a non-union contractor was hired; and the excessive number of contractors on the project. The renovation did not add any extra beds. The garage was completed in 1993 after multiple delays. During the project, hospital employees had been given permission to park their cars in a city playground across Broadway, which had prompted protests and a lawsuit from neighborhood residents, although the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation had promised to repair any damage to the playground. New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani proposed leasing the Elmhurst Hospital, Queens Hospital, and Coney Island Hospital in 1995. The three hospitals collectively cost the city $1.7 billion to operate over each decade. Mount Sinai Health System considered taking up the lease, but the plan was met with opposition from hospital advocates, and Mount Sinai eventually rejected the plan in 1996. = 21st century = By the 2000s, due to the high ethnic diversity of surrounding areas, Elmhurst Hospital implemented programs to cater to patients' different cultural practices. In 2005, The New York Times reported that the 500,000 patients that visited Elmhurst Hospital the previous year spoke over 100 languages or dialects, and that \\"roughly half\\" needed an interpreter because they spoke so little English. As a result, signs were ordered in several additional languages, and dozens of multilingual staff members were given extra training. The Hope Pavilion for cancer patients was opened in 2008. The hospital continued to suffer from shortages of equipment, as well as long delays. A city audit in 2011 found that during the 2009 fiscal year, waiting times for mammograms were the longest of nine public hospitals that were audited. Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the hospital was operating at 80% capacity. When the pandemic spread to the New York City area in March 2020, available beds were quickly filled up and patients without COVID-19 were transferred to other facilities. During the pandemic, 13 people died in a single day, including at least one who died while waiting for a bed. In the last week of March 2020, Elmhurst Hospital became the \\"center of the center\\" of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York as the state itself became an epicenter of the global pandemic. The hospital rented a refrigerator truck for a morgue, set up temporary hospital tents, and received donations of 40 ventilators from the city in late March to help COVID patients breathe. Prior to the donations, Elmhurst Hospital had 63 ventilators. It also received 40 BiPAP machines from Tesla, Inc.. Admissions decreased during the first week of April, but doctors said that they were sending home patients who would have been admitted if there were space for them.

It is operated by NYC Health + Hospitals, a public benefit corporation of the city. Queens General Hospital opened in 1935 as the first municipal general hospital in the borough. It would absorb the adjacent Queensboro Hospital for Communicable Diseases shortly after opening, and the campus would later include Triboro Hospital for Tuberculosis, which opened in 1941. Queens Hospital Center was formed in 1952 and 1959 with the official merger of the three hospitals along with two other Queens medical facilities. The current campus consists of modern buildings constructed in the 21st century, along with the former Triboro Hospital building. Campus Triboro Hospital, at Parsons Boulevard and 82nd Drive. Queens Hospital Center is located on a campus in the Hillcrest neighborhood of Queens. The large property is bound by Parsons Boulevard to the west and 164th Street to the east, with Goethals Avenue to the north. At the south end of the site is the Grand Central Parkway, though most of the campus ends one block north at 82nd Drive. The main building, opened in 2001, is located at the southwest corner of 164th Street and 82nd Road just north of the Grand Central Parkway. The building was designed by the Perkins and Will and Davis Brody Bond architectural firms, with a largely-glass outer facade. It has of space and 200 beds. It features private and semi-private patient rooms, in contrast to the large hospital wards of the previous buildings. Adjacent to the south of the main building fronting the Grand Central is the only remaining pre-2000 hospital building. This is the \\"N Building\\", the former Queens Hospital Center School of Nursing built in 1956. It is connected to the main building by an atrium structure. The nursing school graduated its final class in June 1977. Across to the north from the main building is \\"The Pavilion\\", opened in 2007. It is an outpatient ambulatory care facility. It was designed by the Perkins Eastman firm, and constructed by Dormitory Authority of the State of New York. It is six-stories high extending across from east-to-west, and has of space. The outer facade consists of precast concrete, with glass curtain walls on the east (front) and south faces. The building has a structural steel frame with a cantilever spine. The interior utilizes modular walls to allow for quick expansion of clinics. The entrance to the building at 164th Street has a two-story atrium and entrance plaza. A public concourse runs along the south side of the building. Two bridges connect with the main QHC building, each measuring in length. Services provided at The Pavilion include a diabetes treatment center, primary care, child development and early childhood intervention, pediatrics, psychiatry, ophthalmology, and dentistry. At the west end of the campus on Parsons Boulevard between 82nd Drive and Goethals Avenue is \\"Building T\\" or the \\"T Building\\". It was originally the Triboro Hospital for Tuberculosis, completed in 1941. The building was designed by architect John Russell Pope, and later by the Eggers & Higgins firm after Pope's death, in Art Moderne- style. Then-New York City Commissioner of Hospitals Dr. Sigismund Goldwater supervised the design. A tunnel in the basement connected to the now demolished Queens General Hospital buildings. The T Building is currently used by QHC for administrative offices, storage, and clinic and psychiatric services. Several clinics were relocated to The Pavilion when it opened in 2007. More services have been relocated from the T Building since then, due to the deteriorating condition of the building. In between the Pavilion and the Triboro Hospital, at the corner of 82nd Drive and 161st Street (160-15 82nd Drive) is an Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York. It is a morgue, providing autopsy and mortuary services. The building was constructed circa 2007. At the northeast corner of the campus, at 164th Street and Goethals Avenue, is the power plant for the hospital. The two-story Art Deco brick building was completed in 1932, built along with the original Queens General Hospital, and was considered a modern facility at the time of its construction. One of its most notable features is its large chimney. Adjacent to the west between 160th and 161st Streets is the Queens Gateway to Health Sciences Secondary School, a grades 6‚Äì12 public school. Adjacent to the west of the school is FDNY EMS Station 50, opened in July 2016, which dispatches FDNY ambulances and contains the Queens EMS Borough Command Center. The EMS station, designed by Dean-Wolf Architects, has a glass and aluminum outer facade, a steel frame, and a concrete foundation with a cantilever shape due to the topography of the area. It is the largest EMS station in the borough. Another EMS station and medical examiner building, and storage and utility buildings were previously located along Goethals Avenue (see below). At the western end of the block on Parsons Boulevard adjacent to Building T is a storage garage, built in 1957. =Old Queens General Hospital buildings= As originally constructed in 1935, the Queens General Hospital consisted of eleven buildings. Prior to the construction of the current campus, the site contained 14 buildings. Most of the buildings in the complex were constructed of brick, and all of the original buildings were connected by tunnels. The original main Queens General Hospital building fronted 164th Street between 82nd Road and the power plant, on the site of the current Pavilion. It was built in Art Deco-style. It stood nine stories tall, with two additional floors at the center of the structure. The building was set back from the street. Its outer facade consisted of orange or salmon-colored brick, with sandstone trim. It originally housed 582 beds. There were three wards per floor, for a total of 18 wards. In the sub-basement were a storeroom and sewage utilities. The basement contained kitchens and cafeterias, a record room, a patient library, and a pharmacy. A sunroom was located on the tenth floor. Murals created by Georgette Seabrooke and William C. Palmer were present in the building. Located on the site of the current main building and nursing school were a nurses home for housing nurses, an employee's home for medical residents and hospital superintendents, and a staff building for administrative offices. Along Goethals Avenue, where the Queens Gateway School and EMS station now sit, were (from east to west) the power plant, a laundry facility, a garage for ambulance storage, an industrial workshop for creating furniture and other items, and the mortuary building. The morgue, which occupied the site of the school on 160th Street, was a small salmon brick building, and served as a municipal morgue for the entire borough. This site was found to be contaminated with petroleum prior to the construction of the school. In between Goethals Avenue and 82nd Drive, along the right-of-way of 160th Street near the current morgue, was the Queensboro Hospital which became Queens General's contagious disease division called the Queensboro Pavilion. It consisted of two buildings. Only the power plant survives from the original 1930s campus. =Transportation= The bus route runs north-to-south along 164th Street on the east side of the campus, serving the main buildings. The Q25 and Q34 buses run along Parsons Boulevard at the west end of the campus, directly serving Building T. The bus runs along Union Turnpike two blocks north of the hospital grounds, which gets very good usage by this hospitals personnel, and out-patients as well. The closest New York City Subway stations are the Parsons Boulevard station of the IND Queens Boulevard Line on Hillside Avenue to the south, connected by the Q25, Q34, and Q65, and the Kew Gardens‚ÄìUnion Turnpike station to the west connected by the Q46. The Q25, Q34, and Q65 routes also connect with the Jamaica Center‚ÄìParsons/Archer subway station on Parsons and Archer Avenues, and the Sutphin Boulevard‚ÄìArcher Avenue‚ÄìJFK Airport subway and Jamaica Long Island Rail Road stations on Supthin Boulevard and Archer Avenue. Service area Although it is located approximately between Northeast Queens and Southeast Queens, Queens Hospital Center predominantly serves neighborhoods in Southeast Queens south of Union Turnpike and east of the Van Wyck Expressway. These areas include Jamaica, South Jamaica, Hollis, Queens Village, Springfield Gardens, Cambria Heights, St. Albans, and Rosedale. The hospital also serves areas of Flushing, Oakland Gardens. and Fresh Meadows within the 11364, 11365, 11366, and 11367 zip codes (Kew Gardens Hills and Pomonok), as well as parts of Richmond Hill, Ozone Park, and South Ozone Park which lie west of the Van Wyck. As of 2016, over 40 percent of the service area's population is Black, including African Americans and Afro-Caribbeans. Of the remaining population, 15 percent is Hispanic or Latino, 10 percent identifies as Asian or Pacific Islander, and 4 percent identifies as White. A significant portion of the service area consists of South Asian immigrants from nations such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, as well as Guyanese. Much of the population is foreign-born and low income. History The 22-acre site of Queens Hospital Center was originally the Haack farm, purchased by the city in 1903. The first hospital on the site was the Queensboro Hospital for Communicable Diseases, located east of Parsons Boulevard (then Flushing Avenue). It was designed by architects William E. Austin and George W. Conable, and opened on June 29, 1916. A total of 20 buildings were initially planned for the hospital. A second building was completed in 1923. The first morgue in Queens was opened at the hospital in 1930. =Construction of Queens General Hospital= William C. Palmer working on a mural in Queens General Hospital in 1936 In 1928, Queens County Medical Society (or the Medical Society of Queens County) began petitioning the New York City Board of Estimate and Mayor Jimmy Walker for a free public hospital in the borough. At the time, there were no municipal general hospitals in Queens, and people were required to use Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, or Bellevue Hospital in Lower Manhattan. Queens General Hospital was proposed by the city in 1929, also referred to as the new Queensboro Hospital. The vacant property adjacent to the existing Queensboro Hospital was selected as the site for the new hospital. At the time, only five of the 22 acres on the site were occupied. The contract for general construction was approved by Board of Estimate on October 24, 1930. The cornerstone of the main building was laid by Mayor Walker on June 19, 1931, at 164th Street. The buildings were largely complete by 1932, but remained inactive due to a lack of funds to purchase equipment and furniture, and to complete the surrounding grounds. Meanwhile, a storm drain was installed along 164th Street between Goethals Avenue and 78th Road (just past Union Turnpike) by 1933. The primitive dirt roads surrounding the hospital including 164th Street were improved and paved, with Works Progress Administration funds. Two willow trees, which originally divided farms in the area, were preserved for the hospital, and were the only trees on the hospital grounds upon its opening. On January 5, 1934, the city was awarded a Public Works Administration grant of $800,000, of which $260,000 went to the hospital project. These were the first PWA funds received by city and allowed work on buildings to be completed. The project, however, continued to suffer delays, which led to complaints and protests from local residents. Hospitals commissioner Sigismund Goldwater said that the completion of the hospital was blocked by \\"red tape\\". On October 30, 1935, the hospital was dedicated, with Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, commissioner Goldwater and Queens Borough President George U. Harvey in attendance. The new Queens General Hospital campus was referred to as a \\"miniature city\\" due to its many buildings, and its self-sustaining facilities such as the power plant, a heating plant, and the laundry building. Among the then-modern medical innovations at the hospital were specialized X-ray equipment, radium for the treatment of cancer (a practice now obsolete), and an iron lung. The first patient was admitted to Queens General Hospital on November 17, 1935. Beds in the new hospital were reserved for patients who could not afford to pay; those who could were forced to use one of the private hospitals in the borough. On March 1, 1936, the Queensboro Hospital was merged into Queens General. At this time, Queensboro Hospital was renamed the Queensboro Pavilion for Communicable Diseases. By July 1936 the hospital was overcrowded, operating at 126.3 percent capacity. Additional storm drains were installed around hospital and in the surrounding neighborhood in 1939. Around this time the Queensboro Pavilion was renovated. Triboro Hospital for Tuberculosis was dedicated at the west end of the campus on January 28, 1941 by Mayor La Guardia, who stated that it was designed to be converted into a general hospital \\"twenty-five years from now.\\" =Creation of Queens Hospital Center= On June 19, 1952, it was announced that Queens General, Queensboro Hospital, and Triboro Hospital would be consolidated into Queens Hospital Center. Three other facilities were also absorbed into the new hospital: Neponsit Beach Hospital, another tuberculosis hospital adjacent to Jacob Riis Park in Neponsit, Rockaway; the College Point Outpatient Department, an outpatient dispensary; and the Ozone Park ambulance station. In spite of the unification, Queens General and Triboro Hospital continued to operate largely independent of each other. The College Point dispensary was closed at the end of August 1954, while Neponsit Beach Hospital was closed on April 21, 1955 due to a declining need for tuberculosis treatment. On January 25, 1954, QHC opened a child orthopedic rehabilitation center in the Queens Pavilion. Beginning in fall 1954, Queens Hospital Center and Queens College began an experimental two-year nursing program free of tuition, funded by a $50,000 grant from the Board of Higher Education of the City of New York (now the City University of New York). This program would evolve into the Queens Hospital Center School of Nursing. The building was constructed in 1956, and the school opened on September 19, 1956 with 70 students. In January 1959, the hospital boards of Queens General and Triboro Hospital were combined to improve efficiency, completing the merger of the hospitals. In 1962, a city-run medical school was proposed to be built in conjunction with Queens Hospital and Queens College. The school would have been built on then-vacant land between the main Queens General building and Triboro Hospital. In July 1964, QHC signed affiliation deals with the Long Island Jewish Medical Center and Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks, as well as the now-closed Mary Immaculate Hospital in downtown Jamaica. At this time there were plans to construct an expansion of the medical center in between the Triboro and Queens General buildings, adding up to 1,000 beds. It was projected to be complete by 1970. =1970s= By the 1970s, the Triboro Hospital transitioned into a normal hospital within the Queens Hospital complex. At this time, Queens Hospital Center was considered antiquated, with over 90 percent of the hospital beds below state health standards, along with overcrowding of hospital wards and shortages of equipment. The large and open hospital wards with dozens of beds that Queens General and Triboro Hospital were built with were now in violation of modern health codes. In addition, private hospitals often sent unwanted patients to Queens Hospital, which as a municipal hospital could not refuse them. The medical center was referred to as a \\"snake pit\\" by city councilman Matthew J. Troy, Jr., in reference to its condition and code violations. Because of this, the city began looking for a site further south, in Jamaica or South Jamaica, to construct a replacement for Queens Hospital Center. The primary location of interest was a site on Liberty Avenue adjacent to the west of the future York College campus between Jamaica and South Jamaica, just south of the Long Island Rail Road Main Line and abutting its Atlantic Branch. Relocation to this area would bring the hospital closer to the majority of its patient population. A new hospital at this site would be served by extensions of New York City Subway lines along Archer Avenue, then being built, and planned further extensions into Southeast Queens. This hospital along with York College and the subway lines would be built as part of the renewal of the downtown Jamaica area during that time, which would create Jamaica Center. Other plans included building on an alternate South Jamaica site, and rebuilding the hospital on its current property. The city also evaluated creating a medical school for the new hospital, to be affiliated with York College, Queens College, or the Stony Brook University School of Medicine then under construction. The QHC School of Nursing graduated its final class on June 12, 1977. By September of that year, the plans to construct a new hospital had not moved forward. In response, many of the Black members of the QHC community advisory board resigned, accusing the White members of the board and local residents of colluding to keep the hospital in its current location. Local residents and members of Queens Community Board 8 (representing Hillcrest) were in fact opposed to the relocation of the hospital. By 1981, the relocation plans were cancelled due to the city's fiscal crisis. =1990s: Attempts to sell= By the 1990s, Queens Hospital Center was deteriorating, with capacity reduced to 300 beds. At the time, the hospital was treating 325,000 patients annually, almost 40 percent of whom were uninsured. In February 1992, Long Island Jewish Medical Center (LIJ) ended its 25-year deal to provide medical residents for rotation at Queens Hospital Center. Afterwards, the Health and Hospitals Corporation began searching for an affiliation with a medical school for QHC. In particular, the city and Mayor David Dinkins were searching for a deal with a \\"minority\\" medical school, which would have a majority Black and/or Latino student population that would reflect the hospital's patient demographics. Potential schools included Howard University College of Medicine, Meharry Medical College, and Morehouse School of Medicine, all located outside New York State, as well as the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine. In April 1992, Mount Sinai Medical Center agreed to supply doctors to the hospital, filling 352 doctor positions (primarily general practice and pediatrics) and 20 medical technician spots. Mount Sinai had already been providing doctors to Elmhurst Hospital Center, another city hospital. In 1993, Mount Sinai assumed control of Queens Hospital's OB-GYN program, replacing LIJ. A 1992 survey by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations cited Queens Hospital Center for several safety violations, including \\"dead-end corridors, inadequate egress, poor ventilation and shared toilet facilities.\\" In 1993, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (now NYC Health + Hospitals) began plans for a replacement hospital. On February 23, 1995, Mayor Rudy Giuliani proposed the sale of all 11 city hospitals operated by the Health and Hospitals Corporation. At this time, the city began accepting bids for sale of Queens Hospital, Elmhurst Hospital Center in western Queens, and Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn. These three hospitals were selected because they were the \\"most marketable\\". A planned $485 million renovation of QHC was cancelled due to a financial crisis and the plans to sell the hospital. $25 million had already been spent by the city on preliminary designs by Henningson, Durham, and Richardson, Inc and Morrison-Knudsen. The plans to sell the hospital also prevented Queens Gateway Secondary School from being moved onto the campus. In March 1995, the pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Flushing went on a hunger strike in protest of the proposed sales of the hospitals. Later that month, the pastor held a mock funeral outside Queens Hospital in protest. By September 1995, Giuliani and the city explored the possibility of leasing the three hospitals, with the Mount Sinai Health System planning to bid on Queens Hospital Center and Elmhurst Hospital Center. Meanwhile, a third of the Queens Hospital staff had left in the year leading up to fall 1995. The hospital also began charging uninsured patients for services such as prescriptions, which had previously been free of charge, in response to budgetary constraints. In March 1996, the New York City Council sued Mayor Giuliani over the proposed sale of the hospitals. The conflict over hospitals was one of several power struggles between the mayor and the City Council after the dissolution of the New York City Board of Estimate in 1990. In March 1996, Mount Sinai withdrew bids to take over Queens Hospital and Elmhurst Hospital. Later that month, the Community Advisory Board of QHC also filed suit against the mayor. The plans to sell Coney Island Hospital were blocked by the New York Supreme Court on January 15, 1997. According to the ruling, the 1970 state law creating the Health and Hospitals Corporation did not grant the agency the ability to sell or lease city hospitals; this power had been previously held by the Board of Estimate. By mid-1997, Mayor Giuliani dropped his plans to sell the hospitals. =New Queens Hospital Center= On August 19, 1997, after the failed sale, Mayor Giuliani announced plans to construct state-of-the-art buildings on the Queens Hospital Center campus. Originally planned with 379 beds, the new hospital later had its capacity reduced to 200. The project was promoted by Queens Borough President Claire Shulman. Ground broke on the new hospital on October 8, 1998. At least three of the original buildings were demolished to make room. The construction of new hospital took place in spite of continuing attempts to sell or privatize the hospital. The project was financed with taxable municipal bonds issued from the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York, in order to lower costs in the event the city decided to sell the hospital in the future. The new Queens Hospital Center, which cost $147 million to construct, was opened December 5, 2001, at a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by Mayor Giuliani. Due to the closures of nearby St. Joseph's Hospital and Mary Immaculate Hospital around 2005, Queens Hospital Center saw increases in patients. The new pavilion across from the main hospital was unveiled at a ribbon-cutting ceremony on November 17, 2006, and officially opened in January 2007. Queens Gateway to Health Sciences Secondary School opened at the north end of the campus in fall 2010. Groundbreaking took place for FDNY EMS Station 50 in December 2013. The EMS station opened on July 22, 2016.

Lang believes that the existence of financial speculators internationally, such as George Soros of Quantum Group of Fund, these speculators are foreign exchange parity, commodities, precious metals prices from fluctuations in the main promoters, and Lang believes that behind them there is a long-term support of the world's financial powers, so meaningful, \\" financial war\\" , the rise and fall of these financial war against a country plays a key role, he and \\"Currency Wars\\", author Song Hongbing along with as \\"conspiracy theorists.\\" The face of the increasing appreciation of international oil prices in 2008, prices of food and some money, Lang pointed out that it is likely to be a behind by the \\" international financial speculators \\" under the control of a situation. The Chinese part of the industry, such as the steel industry is severely affected.  Enterprise strategy  Lang repeatedly points to South Korean enterprises as a model, and criticizes many of China's emerging enterprises. He advocates studying the practices of transnational corporations, of cutting process flow in enterprises where enterprises no longer tangled in one or two leadership capacity, maintaining long-term business, but also full of innovation. : (TODO: This section needs to be translated from Chinese.)  Social repercussions  = Reactions in the Chinese business community = : (TODO: This section needs to be translated from Chinese.) = Reactions among Chinese economists = Among circles of Chinese economists, the prevailing opinion is that Lang's area of expertise does not cover China's economic system: he lacks a true understanding of China's situation, and his views on the restructuring of state enterprises are mostly shunned by his peers. Initially, key economists remained silent, but then they realized that Lang seemed to be on the way to affect China's fundamental national policies. So, they began to criticize his theories to try to turn the tide. Besides academic criticisms, there were also accusations of \\"grandstanding\\" and \\"fishing for fame.\\" Nevertheless, it would appear that their attempts in turning the tide were basically futile. * Wu Jinglian:Lang's final verdict is \\"China's society has never been this bad in 5000 years.\\" His rationale is two-fold: first, the path of economic development alone, and second, marketization. (TODO: Some text in this paragraph still needs to be translated into Chinese and is commented out.) * Steven N. S. Cheung: Professor Lang knows nearly nothing about China's economic and political infrastructure. ... However, as a professor, how could Mr. Lang make such generalizations so irresponsibly? * Zhou Qiren: Speaking of Lang, I think it is not difficult to see that he is wrong. ... I do not see in Lang's allegations any kind of complex theories, concepts and reasoning. ... Lang [claimed], \\"Whose are the state-owned assets? Yours, mine, ours.\\" ... Now what is he muddling? He has no share of nothing. No matter how blurry the property rights of state-owned assets are, it should be obvious that he has no part in the subject of rights. ... I can say with certainty that these outrageous views of Lang's did not just come off the top of his head. The question beckons: These \\"stuff\\"‚Äînonsensical, illogical, and just plain rude‚Äîcame off the top of whose head? * Zhiwu Chen thinks that Lang's conspiracy theory is the opium of the people. = Reactions of relevant departments in the Chinese government = : (TODO: This section needs to be translated from Chinese.)

He rose to the rank of captain in 1793, lieutenant-colonel in 1811, colonel in 1825, major-general in 1837 and finally lieutenant-general in 1846. In 1831 Thornton was knighted by William IV and made a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order. He was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Hull in 1816. Thornton had a close relationship with the British Royal family over his life, serving under the Duke of York and saving the Duke's life during the Flanders campaign in 1793. He was equerry to the Duke of Cumberland from 1813 until his death and had a close relationship with George IV. Thornton was among the chief mourners at the funeral of H.R.H. Princess Sophia.

It is a form of popular working- class music which evolved from baladi in the second half of the 20th century. - The musical styles of Algerian chaabi or Moroccan chaabi, sharing the same Arabic name, are very different and older musical genres. Shaabi means \\"of the people.\\" It originated in Cairo in the 1970s as a new form of urban music expressing the difficulties and frustrations of modern Egyptian life. Shaabi lyrics can be both intensely political, and filled with humour and double entendre. Because of its nature as street music, and a widespread indifference to copyright law among Egyptians, Shaabi today is mainly distributed on pirated tapes and CDs. The first shaabi singer to rise to stardom was Ahmed Adaweyah, whose first album in 1972 sold a million copies. Like many shaabi singers, Adaweyah was famed for his mawwal. More recently, Shaaban Abdel Rahim rose to fame in 2000 with the controversial \\"Ana Bakra Israel\\" (\\"I hate Israel\\"), and has remained something of a working-class hero due to a string of populist political hits. Other well-known singers in the shaabi genre include Saad al-Soghayer, Amina, and Abdelbaset Hamouda. Another notable singer is Hakim, who is from a middle-class background unlike most shaabi singers, and whose commercially successful brand of shaabi-pop is generally cheerful and apolitical.  Mahraganat  The most recent new development to come out of Cairo's Shaabi scene is 'mahraganat' ('festivals'; ) music, also known as 'electro-shaabi' in the West. However the performers use mahraganat (meaning a big, loud, messy event; and a festival) to distinguish themselves from sha'bi,. The best-known artists in this genre are Hamo Bika, Oka Wi Ortega, Sadat, Figo, Alaa 50 Cent, Shahta Karika, and Islam Chipsy.Maria Golla, ‚ÄúEgypt‚Äôs Mahragan: Music of the Masses.‚Äù Middle East Institute.

Its protections and restrictions had also been chipped away during most of its existence by lenient regulatory interpretations and use of loopholes. After Glass‚ÄìSteagall's 1999 repeal, there was a great deal of discussion in the banking and securities industries, and among policymakers and economists, about the practical positive and negative changes to the business and consumer environment. Later, as financial crises and other issues played out in the United States and even worldwide, arguments have broken out about whether Glass‚ÄìSteagall, as originally intended, would have prevented these issues. Commentator response to Section 20 and 32 repeal President Bill Clinton's signing statement for the GLBA summarized the established argument for repealing Glass‚ÄìSteagall Section's 20 and 32 in stating that this change, and the GLBA's amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act, would \\"enhance the stability of our financial services system\\" by permitting financial firms to \\"diversify their product offerings and thus their sources of revenue\\" and make financial firms \\"better equipped to compete in global financial markets.\\" With Salomon Smith Barney already operating as a Section 20 affiliate of Citibank under existing law, commentators did not find much significance in the GLBA's repeal of Sections 20 and 32. Many commentators noted those sections \\"were dead\\" before the GLBA. The GLBA's amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act to permit banks to affiliate with insurance underwriting companies was a new power. Under a 1982 amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act bank affiliates had been prohibited from underwriting most forms of insurance. Because the GLBA permitted banks to affiliate with insurance underwriters, Citigroup was able to retain ownership of the Travelers insurance underwriting business. Overall, however, commentators viewed the GLBA \\"as ratifying and extending changes that had already been made, rather than as revolutionary.\\"Barth et al. 2000, p. 196. At least one commentator found the entire GLBA \\"unnecessary\\" for banks and suggested the OCC had the authority to grant national banks all the insurance underwriting powers permitted to affiliates through the GLBA.Fisher 2001, pp. 1337-1367. As John Boyd had earlier, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank president Gary Stern and Arthur Wilmarth warned that the GLBA's permission for broader combinations of banking, securities, and insurance activities could increase the \\"too big to fail\\" problem.Stern 2000. Stern and Feldman 2004, p. 77 Financial industry developments after repeal of Sections 20 and 32 =Citigroup gives up insurance underwriting= The GLBA permitted Citigroup to retain the Travelers property, casualty, and life insurance underwriting businesses beyond the five-year \\"divestiture\\" period the Federal Reserve Board could have permitted under the pre-GLBA form of the BHCA. Before that five-year period elapsed, however, Citigroup spun off the Travelers property and casualty insurance business to Citigroup's shareholders.. In 2005 Citigroup sold to Metropolitan Life the Travelers life insurance business.. Commentators noted that Citigroup was left with selling insurance underwritten by third parties, a business it could have conducted without the GLBA.Heyward 2005, p. 1. =Banking, insurance, and securities industries remain structurally unchanged= In November 2003 the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury Department issued to Congress a report (Joint Report) on the activities of the \\"financial holding companies\\" (FHCs) authorized by the GLBA and the effect of mergers or acquisitions by FHCs on market concentration in the financial services industry. According to the Joint Report, 12% of all bank holding companies had qualified as financial holding companies to exercise the new powers provided by the GLBA, and those companies held 78% of all bank holding company assets. 40 of the 45 bank holding companies with Section 20 affiliates before 2000 had qualified as financial holding companies, and their securities related assets had nearly doubled. The great majority of this increase was at non-U.S. based banks. Such foreign banking companies had acquired several medium-sized securities firms (such as UBS acquiring Paine Webber and Credit Suisse acquiring Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette). Despite these increases in securities activities by bank holding companies that qualified as financial holding companies, the Joint Report found that concentration levels among securities underwriting and dealing firms had not changed significantly since 1999.. Ranked by capital levels, none of the four largest securities dealing and underwriting firms was affiliated with a financial holding company. Although the market share of financial holding companies among the 25 largest securities firms had increased by 5.7 percentage points from that held in 1999 before the GLBA became effective, all of the increase came from foreign banks increasing their U.S. securities operations. The combined market share of the five largest U.S. based financial holding companies declined by 1 percentage point from 1999‚Äì2003, with the largest, Citigroup, experiencing a 2.4 percentage point reduction from 1999‚Äì2003. Of the 45 bank holding companies that had operated Section 20 affiliates before the GLBA, 40 had qualified as financial holding companies, 2 conducted securities underwriting and dealing through direct bank subsidiaries (i.e., \\"financial subsidiaries\\"), and 3 continued to operate Section 20 affiliates subject to pre-GLBA rules. In a speech delivered shortly before the Joint Report was released, Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson stated that the Federal Reserve had \\"not been able to uncover any evidence that the overall market structure of the [banking, insurance, and securities] segments of the financial services industry has substantially changed\\" since the GLBA.. Early in 2004, the Financial Times reported that \\"financial supermarkets\\" were failing around the world, as both diversification and larger size failed to increase profitability. The Congressional Research Service noted that after the GLBA became law the financial services markets in the United States \\"had not really integrated\\" as mergers and consolidations occurred \\"largely within sectors\\" without the expected \\"wholesale integration in financial services.\\". At a July 13, 2004, Senate Banking Committee hearing on the effects of the GLBA five years after passage, the Legislative Director of the Consumer Federation cited Roger Ferguson's 2003 speech and stated the \\"extravagant promises\\" of universal banking had \\"proven to be mostly hype.\\" He noted that advocates of repealing Sections 20 and 32 had said \\"[b]anks, securities firms, and insurance companies would merge into financial services supermarkets\\" and, after five years, some mergers had occurred \\"but mostly within the banking industry, not across sectors.\\". Within the banking industry, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan testified to Congress in 2004 that commercial bank consolidation had \\"slowed sharply in the past five years.\\". At the five-year anniversary of the GLBA in November 2004, the American Banker quoted then retiring Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke Jr. and former FDIC Chairman William Seidman as stating the GLBA had been less significant than expected in not bringing about the combinations of banking, insurance, and investment banking. Hawke described the GLBA provisions permitting such combinations as \\"pretty much a dead letter.\\". Although the article noted other commentators expected this would change in 2005, a May 24, 2005, American Banker article proclaimed 2005 the \\"year of divestiture\\" as \\"many observers\\" described Citigroup's sale of the Travelers life and annuity insurance business as \\"a nail in the coffin of financial services convergence.\\" In 2005 the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank's staff issued a study finding that after five years the GLBA's effects \\"have been modest\\" and the new law \\"simply made it easier for organizations to continue to engage in the activities they had already undertaken.\\". =Competition between commercial banking and investment banking firms= Commentators pointed to the Enron, WorldCom, and other corporate scandals of the early 2000s as exposing the dangers of uniting commercial and investment banking. . More broadly, Arthur Wilmarth questioned whether those scandals and the \\"stock market bubble\\" of the late-1990s were linked to the growing role of commercial banks in the securities markets during the 1990s. As Wilmarth's article indicated, the identified bank or bank affiliate activities linked to the Enron and World Com corporate scandals began in 1996 (or earlier) and most occurred before March 11, 2000, when bank holding companies could first use the new securities powers the GLBA provided to \\"financial holding companies.\\" In the 1990s investment banks complained that commercial banking firms with Section 20 affiliates had coerced customers into hiring the Section 20 affiliate to underwrite securities in order to receive loans from the affiliated bank, which would have violated the \\"anti- tying\\" provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act. In 1997 the GAO issued a report reviewing those claims.. After the GLBA became law, investment banks continued to claim such illegal \\"tying\\" was being practiced. In 2003 the GAO issued another report reviewing those claims.. Partly because of the \\"tying\\" issue many commentators expected investment banking firms would need to convert into bank holding companies (and qualify as financial holding companies) to compete with commercial bank affiliated securities firms.. Eaton 1995, pp. 1188-1189 and 1214-1219. No major investment bank, however, became a bank holding company until 2008 in the midst of the late-2000s financial crisis. Then all five major \\"free standing\\" investment banks (i.e., those not part of a bank holding company). entered bankruptcy proceedings (Lehman Brothers), were acquired by bank holding companies (Bear Stearns by JP Morgan Chase and Merrill Lynch by Bank of America), or became bank holding companies by converting their industrial loan companies (\\"nonbank banks\\") into a national (Morgan Stanley) or state chartered Federal Reserve member bank (Goldman Sachs). At the July 13, 2004, Senate Banking Committee hearing on the GLBA's effects, the Securities Industry Association representative explained securities firms had not taken advantage of the GLBA's \\"financial holding company\\" powers because that would have required them to end affiliations with commercial firms by 2009.. GLBA critics had complained that the law had prevented insurance and securities firms from truly entering the banking business by making a \\"faulty\\" distinction between commercial and financial activities.. . The Consumer Federation of America and other commentators suggested securities firms had avoided becoming \\"financial holding companies\\" because they wanted to avoid Federal Reserve supervision as bank holding companies.. Heyward 2005, pp. 4-6. The SEC (through its Chairman Arthur Levitt) had supported efforts to permit securities firms to engage in non-FDIC insured banking activities without the Federal Reserve's \\"intrusive banking- style oversight\\" of the \\"overall holding company.\\"Levitt 1998 (\\"Market Discipline--not Safety and Soundness Regulation--for Securities Firms). After the GLBA became law, securities firms continued (and expanded) their deposit and lending activities through the \\"unitary thrifts\\" and \\"nonbank banks\\" (particularly industrial loan companies) they had used before the GLBA to avoid regulation as bank holding companies.. Alan Greenspan later noted securities firms only took on the \\"embrace\\" of Federal Reserve Board supervision as bank holding companies (and financial holding companies) after the financial crisis climaxed in September 2008.Greenspan 2010, p. 29, fn. 47. Melanie Fein has described how the consolidation of the banking and securities industries occurred in the 1990s, particularly after the Federal Reserve Board's actions in 1996 and 1997 increasing Section 20 \\"bank-ineligible\\" revenue limits and removing \\"firewalls.\\" Fein stated that \\"[a]lthough the Gramm-Leach-Blily Act was expected to trigger a cascade of new consolidation proposals, no major mergers of banks and securities firms occurred in the years immediately following\\" and that the \\"consolidation trend resumed abruptly in 2008 as a result of the financial crisis\\" leading to all the large investment banks being acquired by, or converting into, bank holding companies. Fein noted the lack of consolidation activity after 1999 and before September 2008 was \\"perhaps because much of the consolidation had occurred prior to the Act.\\" Commentators cite only three major financial firms from outside the banking industry (the discount broker Charles Schwab, the insurance company MetLife, and the mutual fund company Franklin Resources) for qualifying as financial holding companies after the GLBA became effective and before the late-2000s financial crisis.Heyward 2005, p. 5. In 2011 the European Central Bank published a working paper that concluded commercial bank Section 20 affiliate underwriting of corporate bonds in the 1990s had been of lower quality than the underwriting of non-commercial bank affiliated securities firms.Focarelli, Marques-Ibanez, and Pozzolo 2011, pp. 7-8, 13-15, and 22-23. The authors suggest the most likely explanation was that commercial bank affiliates \\"had to be initially more aggressive than investment bank houses in order to gain market share, and in pursuing this objective they might have loosened their credit standards excessively.\\"Focarelli, Marques- Ibanez, and Pozzolo 2011, p. 23. The working paper only examined corporate bonds underwritten from 1991 through 1999, a period before the GLBA permitted financial holding companies.Focarelli, Marques-Ibanez, and Pozzolo 2011, pp. 13-14. Glass‚ÄìSteagall \\"repeal\\" and the financial crisis Robert Kuttner, Joseph Stiglitz, Elizabeth Warren, Robert Weissman, Richard D. Wolff and others have tied Glass‚ÄìSteagall repeal to the late-2000s financial crisis. Kuttner acknowledged \\"de facto inroads\\" before Glass‚ÄìSteagall \\"repeal\\" but argued the GLBA's \\"repeal\\" had permitted \\"super-banks\\" to \\"re-enact the same kinds of structural conflicts of interest that were endemic in the 1920s,\\" which he characterized as \\"lending to speculators, packaging and securitizing credits and then selling them off, wholesale or retail, and extracting fees at every step along the way.\\". Stiglitz argued \\"the most important consequence of Glass‚ÄìSteagall repeal\\" was in changing the culture of commercial banking so that the \\"bigger risk\\" culture of investment banking \\"came out on top.\\". He also argued the GLBA \\"created ever larger banks that were too big to be allowed to fail,\\" which \\"provided incentives for excessive risk taking.\\". Warren explained Glass‚ÄìSteagall had kept banks from doing \\"crazy things.\\" She credited FDIC insurance, the Glass‚ÄìSteagall separation of investment banking, and SEC regulations as providing \\"50 years without a crisis\\" and argued that crises returned in the 1980s with the \\"pulling away of the threads\\" of regulation. Weissman agrees with Stiglitz that the \\"most important effect\\" of Glass‚ÄìSteagall \\"repeal\\" was to \\"change the culture of commercial banking to emulate Wall Street's high-risk speculative betting approach.\\". Lawrence White and Jerry Markham rejected these claims and argued that products linked to the financial crisis were not regulated by Glass‚ÄìSteagall or were available from commercial banks or their affiliates before the GLBA repealed Glass‚ÄìSteagall sections 20 and 32.; Alan Blinder wrote in 2009 that he had \\"yet to hear a good answer\\" to the question \\"what bad practices would have been prevented if Glass‚ÄìSteagall was still on the books?\\" Blinder argued that \\"disgraceful\\" mortgage underwriting standards \\"did not rely on any new GLB powers,\\" that \\"free-standing investment banks\\" not the \\"banking-securities conglomerates\\" permitted by the GLBA were the major producers of \\"dodgy MBS,\\" and that he could not \\"see how this crisis would have been any milder if GLB had never passed.\\". Similarly, Melanie Fein has written that the financial crisis \\"was not a result of the GLBA\\" and that the \\"GLBA did not authorize any securities activities that were the cause of the financial crisis.\\"¬ß1.02 Fein noted \\"[s]ecuritization was not an activity authorized by the GLBA but instead had been held by the courts in 1990 to be part of the business of banking rather than an activity proscribed by the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act.\\" As described above, in 1978 the OCC approved a national bank securitizing residential mortgages. Carl Felsenfeld and David L. Glass wrote that \\"[t]he public‚Äîwhich for this purpose includes most of the members of Congress\\" does not understand that the investment banks and other \\"shadow banking\\" firms that experienced \\"runs\\" precipitating the financial crisis (i.e., AIG, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch) never became \\"financial holding companies\\" under the GLBA and, therefore, never exercised any new powers available through Glass‚ÄìSteagall \\"repeal.\\"Felsenfeld and Glass 2011, p. 362. They joined Jonathan R. Macey and Peter J. Wallison in noting many GLBA critics do not understand that Glass‚ÄìSteagall's restrictions on banks (i.e., Sections 16 and 21) remained in effect and that the GLBA only repealed the affiliation provisions in Sections 20 and 32.Felsenfeld and Glass 2011, p. 312. . The American Bankers Association, former President Bill Clinton, and others have argued that the GLBA permission for affiliations between securities and commercial banking firms \\"helped to mitigate\\" or \\"softened\\" the financial crisis by permitting bank holding companies to acquire troubled securities firms or such troubled firms to convert into bank holding companies.. Martin Mayer argued there were \\"three reasonable arguments\\" for tying Glass‚ÄìSteagall repeal to the financial crisis: (1) it invited banks to enter risks they did not understand; (2) it created \\"network integration\\" that increased contagion; and (3) it joined the incompatible businesses of commercial and investment banking. Mayer, however, then described banking developments in the 1970s and 1980s that had already established these conditions before the GLBA repealed Sections 20 and 32.. Mayer's 1974 book The Bankers detailed the \\"revolution in banking\\" that followed Citibank establishing a liquid secondary market in \\"negotiable certificates of deposit\\" in 1961. This new \\"liability management\\" permitted banks to fund their activities through the \\"capital markets,\\" like nonbank lenders in the \\"shadow banking market,\\" rather than through the traditional regulated bank deposit market envisioned by the 1933 Banking Act.Mayer 1974, pp. 192-197. In 1973 Sherman J. Maisel wrote of his time on the Federal Reserve Board and described how \\"[t]he banking system today is far different from what it was even in 1960\\" as \\"formerly little used instruments\\" were used in the \\"money markets\\" and \\"turned out to be extremely volatile.\\" In describing the \\"transformation of the U.S. financial services industry\\" from 1975-2000 (i.e., from after the \\"revolution in banking\\" described by Mayer in 1974 to the effective date of the GLBA), Arthur Wilmarth described how during the 1990s, despite remaining bank holding companies, J.P. Morgan & Co. and Bankers Trust \\"built financial profiles similar to securities firms with a heavy emphasis on trading and investments.\\" In 1993, Helen Garten described the transformation of the same companies into \\"wholesale banks\\" similar to European \\"universal banks.\\"Garten 1993, pp. 169-170 and 182-185. Jan Kregel agrees that \\"multifunction\\" banks are a source for financial crises, but he argues the \\"basic principles\\" of Glass‚ÄìSteagall \\"were eviscerated even before\\" the GLBA. Kregel describes Glass‚ÄìSteagall as creating a \\"monopoly that was doomed to fail\\" because after World War II nonbanks were permitted to use \\"capital market activities\\" to duplicate more cheaply the deposit and commercial loan products for which Glass‚ÄìSteagall had sought to provide a bank monopoly. While accepting that under Glass‚ÄìSteagall financial firms could still have \\"made, sold, and securitized risky mortgages, all the while fueling a massive housing bubble and building a highly leveraged, Ponzi-like pyramid of derivatives on top,\\" the New Rules Project concludes that commentators who deny the GLBA played a role in the financial crisis \\"fail to recognize the significance of 1999 as the pivotal policy-making moment leading up to the crash.\\" The Project argues 1999 was Congress's opportunity to reject 25 years of \\"deregulation\\" and \\"confront the changing financial system by reaffirming the importance of effective structural safeguards, such as the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act's firewall and market share caps to limit the size of banks; bringing shadow banks into the regulatory framework; and developing new rules to control the dangers inherent in derivatives and other engineered financial products.\\" (\\"The Financial Crisis\\").

In 1820 he issued, in two volumes, Reprints of Rare and Curious Tracts relating to English History, containing 16 seventeenth-century pamphlets, with reproductions of contemporary portraits and a few notes. Following in Caulfield's footsteps, Smeeton issued in 1822 Biographia Curiosa; or Memoirs of Remarkable Characters of the Reign of George III, with their Portraits (London; with 39 portraits, and a plate of the Beggars' Opera at St. Giles).

Local uniformization was introduced by , who separated out the problem of resolving the singularities of a variety into the problem of local uniformization and the problem of combining the local uniformizations into a global desingularization. Local uniformization of a variety at a valuation of its function field means finding a projective model of the variety such that the center of the valuation is non-singular. This is weaker than resolution of singularities: if there is a resolution of singularities then this is a model such that the center of every valuation is non-singular. proved that if one can show local uniformization of a variety then one can find a finite number of models such that every valuation has a non-singular center on at least one of these models. To complete a proof of resolution of singularities it is then sufficient to show that one can combine these finite models into a single model, but this seems rather hard. (Local uniformization at a valuation does not directly imply resolution at the center of the valuation: roughly speaking; it only implies resolution in a sort of \\"wedge\\" near this point, and it seems hard to combine the resolutions of different wedges into a resolution at a point.) proved local uniformization of varieties in any dimension over fields of characteristic 0, and used this to prove resolution of singularities for varieties in characteristic 0 of dimension at most 3. Local uniformization in positive characteristic seems to be much harder. proved local uniformization in all characteristic for surfaces and in characteristics at least 7 for 3-folds, and was able to deduce global resolution of singularities in these cases from this. simplified Abhyankar's long proof. extended Abhyankar's proof of local uniformization of 3-folds to the remaining characteristics 2, 3, and 5. showed that it is possible to find a local uniformization of any valuation after taking a purely inseparable extension of the function field. Local uniformization in positive characteristic for varieties of dimension at least 4 is (as of 2019) an open problem.

They use the postnominal initials O.M.D.  History  =The origins of reform= The Great Western Schism in the Catholic Church (1378-1417) was a period of grave crisis for the stability of life within religious orders. During this period, there developed a movement within the Mercedarian Order to recover the contemplative element of their way of life. It came about in several monasteries of the Order where the Rule of St. Augustine was followed more strictly, the chief proponent of which was the Mercedarian monastery in Valladolid, whose prior was John of Granada. Prior John drew up a proposed renewal of the Order which gained the approval of Antonio Caxal, the Master General of the Order, on 24 September 1414. The reform spread and was embraced by many monasteries of the Order, such as Our Lady of Refuge, near Madrid, which became a great center of spirituality. =A new Order= New instances of renewal developed in the Order after the Council of Trent, in the 16th century. A Mercedarian friar, Juan Bautista Gonz√°lez Alc√°zar (1554-1616), attempted to establish a monastery following this stricter life in Peru during that period, hoping that the lack of established forms of monastic life in the New World would be a more fertile field for this. This effort did not meet with success, however, and he returned to Spain in 1602. There he was appointed the spiritual director of the Monastery of the Refuge, which he then attempted to reform, introducing a more austere form of life than that followed even by the stricter communities of the Order. The Master General of that period, Alonso Monroy, supported the initiative and gave Friar Ferdinando di Santiago the task of drawing up a set of statutes which would supplement the Rule of Life of the Order. This document was adopted on 27 April 1603 by the Provincial Chapter of Castile, held that year at Guadalajara. On 8 May 1603, Gonz√°lez, together with five other friars, formally committed themselves to the \\"Recollection\\" (or Reform), which had as its first base the monastery in Almoraima. He then adopted the new name of John Baptist of the Blessed Sacrament. Fearing a major spit in the Order, in 1606 Pope Clement VIII forbade the reform; he consented, though, to establishing some monasteries in each province of the Order to a stricter life. Despite this ruling, when the next General Chapter was held in Madrid, it ratified the statutes of the reform. The new pope, Paul V, gave his approval on 6 August 1607. The Reform movement saw a quick expansion and within ten years there were 7 monasteries following the Reform in Castile, 10 in Andalusia and 8 in Sicily. On 26 November 1621 Pope Gregory XV authorized the Discalced Mercedarian friars (as the followers of the Reform had come to be called) to elect their own Vicar General, subject only to the Master General. He further prohibited those who followed the original pattern of life from interfering with the new branch of the Order. =Modern era= The Discalced Mercedarian friars suffered severely under the religious suppression of the late 18th century. Their revival did not begin for nearly a century, with the opening of a new house for candidates to the Order in 1886 in Toro, Zamora. Current status The goal of the Order is instruction for the preservation of the Catholic faith. The friars commit themselves to pastoral care, as well as to giving spiritual direction to nuns of enclosed religious orders. Additionally they work with prisoners and the sick in centers of medical care. The friars are present in Spain and in the Dominican Republic. The General Motherhouse is in Las Rozas, near Madrid. As of 2008, the Order consisted of 11 monasteries with 47 friars, 38 of whom were priests.

History Italian archaeologist Antonio Bosio was the first to enter the catacomb, into the upper level (no longer visible today). The first archaeologist to excavate the remains of the catacomb was Orazio Marucchi (1852‚Äì1931): in 1878, while searching for the cemetery, he casually entered a cellar, at the foot of the Parioli hills, and he realized that it actually was a grave covered with pictures, though very ruined because of its change into a room for agricultural use. Marucchi himself also discovered the remains of the outer basilica, dedicated to Saint Valentine. New archaeological investigations were carried out in 1949 by Bruno Maria Apollonj Ghetti. These excavations permitted to ascertain that the martyr Valentine was not buried into the catacomb, but directly into a pit outside it; on this subdial grave, Pope Jiulius I (336‚Äì352) built a former basilical structure, which was modified and enlarged by popes Honorius I (625‚Äì638) and Theodore I (642‚Äì649) and further restored in the following centuries until the last works carried out by Pope Nicholas II in mid-11th century. To this century dates back the testimony of a cloister close to the basilica. The basilica was still existing in the 13th century and some remains were visible in the time of Bosio (1594). It has also been ascertained that, during the 6th century, between the basilica and the catacomb an open-air necropolis rose, with mausoleums, tombs and sarcophaguses. Nowadays hardly anything remains of the catacomb, especially due to the flood and the landslip that involved the area in 1986 and that made most of the galleries inaccessible. The only significant artifacts are the outer basilica and the ambulatory discovered by Marucchi in 1878 and placed at the entrance of the catacomb. The martyr A controversial debate arose between academics and archaeologists during 20th century about the figure of Saint Valentine: in fact, the date of February, 14 is consecrated to two martyr saints with the same name, the priest Valentine from Rome and the bishop Valentine from Terni. The theories can be summed up as follows. #The first solution of the question of the two martyrs bearing the same name is the classic one, asserted by most of the academics until some decades ago: the saints are two different men. Valentine from Rome was a presbyter, who was martyred on February 14 under Emperor Gallienus (253‚Äì268) and was buried by a Christian woman named Sabinilla into a plot she owned at the feet of the Parioli hill. These topographic indications are confirmed by the Chronography of 354, written by Furius Dionysius Filocalus, which is the earliest notice about the martyr Valentine: in fact the Chronography tells that Pope Julius I built a basilica ‚Äúquae appellatur Valentini‚Äù (which is called Valentine's). Moreover, the presence of a man named Valentine in Rome is also attested by the discovery, into the basilica at the feet of the Parioli, of some fragments of a carmen written by Pope Damasus I to celebrate the martyr. #In the 1960s, the Franciscan scholar Agostino Amore, taking his stand on the notice into the Chronography, supposed that a martyr Valentine from Rome never existed. According to his investigation, Valentine is the name of the man who financed the building of the outer basilica under the papacy of Pope Julius I in the mid-4th century and who, due to this donation, deserved the epithet of saint during the 6th century: in order to confirm his thesis, Amore quotes documents from a Roman synod in 595, in which each titular church of Rome is preceded by the word ‚Äúsaint‚Äù, while in a similar document from a synod in 499 the expression sanctus before the name of the Roman titular churches never appears. Finally, for Valentine it seems plausible the same situation of other ancient Roman tituli, like the ones of Saint Cecilia, Saint Praxedes or Saint Pudentiana. #In the last decades, the scholar Vincenzo Fiocchi Nicolai has proposed a new interpretation, according to which the priest Valentine from Rome and the bishop Valentine from Terni would be the same person. Fiocchi Nicolai suggests the existence of a single Valentine, a priest from Terni who came to Rome and here was martyred and buried: later his worhip spread until it reached his native town, where it found a new urge ‚Äúunder more prestigious pretences‚Äù. There would have been a sort of decoupling of the figure of the martyr, that was made more important by his fellow citizens through the assignment of the title of episcopus. Description The former basilica of Saint Valentine has three naves. Two apses, pertaining to different phases of the building, have been brought to light. There are also remains of an underlying crypt - probably due to the works carried out by Pope Leo III (8th‚Äì9th century) - covered in marbles, some fragments of which are still in loco. The only significant room of the catacomb, and also the only that can be visited today, is the ambulatory discovered by Marucchi in the 19th century and converted into a cellar. This room was visited by Antonio Bosio and at that time it was still intact: therefore, thanks to the drawings that he commissioned, it is possible to decipher the remains of the frescoes still surviving. According to their make and kind, they can be dated between 7th century and the beginning of 8th century.

Synopsis Merlin, the illegitimate son of a princess and the grandson of King Conaan is made unwelcome at court. He is fostered by a local smith and his wife, from whom he learns the worth of honest labour. His foster-grandmother, Myfanwy, however is able to see his future, and teaches the boy the magic he will need in King Arthur's service. Unfortunately, the Saxon king, Vortigern, gets wind of Merlin's powers, and his location and takes steps to cause problems for the young magician. Production The series was devised by Anne Carlton and was based on an episode of the series Shadows called \\"The Boy Merlin\\" (directed by Vic Hughes and broadcast 11 October 1978). Broadcast It was broadcast in the UK on ITV in 6 episodes from 23 April to 11 June 1979 (with no episode being transmitted on 7 May owing to Bank Holiday sports coverage) and repeated from 1980/04/11 to 1980/05/16.

Angelou had written four autobiographies and published four other volumes of poetry up to that point. Angelou considered herself a poet and a playwright and her poetry has also been successful, but she is best known for her seven autobiographies, especially her first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. She began, early in her writing career, of alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. Most critics agree that Angelou's poems are more interesting when she recites them. The poems in I Shall Not Be Moved focus on themes of hard work, universal experiences of humans, the struggle of African Americans, and love and relationships. Like most of her poetry, the collection has received little serious critical attention, although most reviews have been positive. Background I Shall Not Be Moved is Maya Angelou's fifth volume of poetry. She studied and began writing poetry at a young age. After her rape at the age of seven, as recounted in her first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), she dealt with her trauma by memorizing and reciting great works of literature, including poetry, which helped bring her out of her self-imposed muteness. Although Angelou considered herself a playwright and poet when her editor Robert Loomis challenged her to write Caged Bird, she has been best known for her autobiographies, and many critics consider her autobiographies more important than her poetry. Critic William Sylvester agrees, and states that although her books have been best-sellers, her poetry has \\"received little serious critical attention\\". Bloom also believes that Angelou's poems are more interesting when she recites them. Bloom calls her performances \\"characteristically dynamic\\", and says that Angelou \\"moves exuberantly, vigorously to reinforce the rhythms of the lines, the tone of the words. Her singing and dancing and electrifying stage presence transcend the predictable words and phrases\\". Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993 Early in her writing career she began alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. By the time I Shall Not Be Moved was published in 1990, she had published five autobiographies, eventually going on to publish seven. Her publisher, Random House, placed the poems in I Shall Not Be Moved in her first collection of poetry, The Complete Collected Poems of Maya Angelou (1994), perhaps to capitalize on her popularity following her reading of her poem \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" at President Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993. Also in the 1994 collection were her four previous collections, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well (1975), And Still I Rise (1978), and Shaker, Why Don't You Sing? (1983). Angelou's publisher placed four poems in a smaller volume entitled Phenomenal Woman in 1995. Themes Critic Lyman B. Hagen states that much of Angelou's poetry and most of her writings, especially \\"Worker's Song\\", the first poem in I Shall Not Be Moved, praises the laborer. He says, \\"In Angelou's writings, rarely is there anyone who does not work. Everyone of her characters‚Äîsingers, dancers, railway workers, etc.‚Äîworks hard\\". Critic Hazel Rochman, who calls the poem an \\"exquisitely simple worksong\\", states that Angelou connects physical action with wit and longing. She compares it to the performances of singer Paul Robeson and to Langston Hughes' poem \\"Florida Road Workers\\". Michele Howe calls I Shall Not Be Moved \\"a collection that testifies to the undaunted spirit of oppressed people everywhere\\", and states that it \\"relates a history of hard work, pain, joy, and the affection and heartbreak often associated with love\\". She also mentions \\"Worker's Song\\" in her article in the New Jersey newspaper The Star-Ledger, stating that it describes the struggles of the workers that \\"keep the whole world running\\". Howe says that although Angelou writes about the Black experience, she draws from the experiences of all ethnic backgrounds. Howe considers the poem \\"Our Grandmothers\\", which relates the struggle of a woman attempting to overcome her enslavement and oppression, one of the most poignant poems in the volume and its focal point. The poem uses the title phrase; according to Howe, Angelou's use of the personal pronoun signifies the universal experience of mothers and grandmothers and their struggles to overcome obstacles. Howe also discusses the poem \\"Coleridge Jackson\\", which she considers another significant poem in I Shall Not Be Moved. The poem describes a man who \\"wouldn't take tea for the fever\\"--someone incapable of creatively dealing with his suffering at the hands of his employer. Angelou informed Howe that she believed that \\"Coleridge Jackson\\" was one of the most powerful poems she had ever recited in public. In the poem \\"Love Letter\\", Angelou describes the power of love to empower people to be themselves in their relationships, and to be equal with their partners. Angelou's poem \\"Human Family\\" focuses on the similarities of all people, especially the line \\"We are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike\\". According to Howe, this line sums the themes found throughout the volume.Angelou uses this line again in her 1993 book of essays, Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now, and in Letter to My Daughter (2008). Lupton calls it Angelou's most famous statement (Lupton, p. 20). Reviews Rochman, when she compares \\"Worker's Song\\" to Hughes' \\"Florida Road Workers\\", states that like Hughes, Angelou's poem combines rhythm and sense. She considers the poem the best in the volume, calling many of the other poems in I Shall Not Be Moved \\"too polemical\\". Rochman says that the sensuous details in Angelou's best poems enlivens her abstractions, and finds no false sentiments in them. She also states, \\"The dying fall of many lines combined with the strong beat reinforces the feeling of struggle and uncertainty\\". Poems The volume's title, according to Angelou, comes from her desire to encourage young people to \\"have a moral stance\\" and never give up, despite the tendency for people in power to ignore, deny, or neglect their duty to use their positions and abilities to change the world. It is dedicated to her mother Vivian Baxter and Mildred Garris Tuttle. * \\"Worker's Song\\" * \\"Human Family\\" * \\"Man Bigot\\" * \\"Old Folks Laugh\\" * \\"Is Love\\" * \\"Forgive\\" * \\"Insignificant\\" * \\"Love Letter\\" * \\"Equality\\" * \\"Coleridge Jackson\\" * \\"Why Are They Happy People\\" * \\"Son to Mother\\" * \\"Known to Eve and Me\\" * \\"These Yet to Be United States\\" * \\"Me and My Work\\" * \\"Changing\\" * \\"Born That Way\\" * \\"Televised\\" * \\"Nothing Much\\" * \\"Glory Falls\\" * \\"London\\" * \\"Savior\\" * \\"Many and More\\" * \\"The New House\\" * \\"Our Grandmothers\\" * \\"Preacher, Don't Send Me\\" * \\"Fightin' Was Natural\\" * \\"Loss of Love\\" * \\"Seven Women's Blessed Assurance\\" * \\"In My Missouri\\" * \\"They Ask Why\\" * \\"When Great Trees Fall\\" References Citations Works cited * Bloom, Harold.

Overview The sixth-generation hardware of the PlayStation 2 video game console consists of various components. At the heart of the console's configuration is its central processing unit (CPU), a custom RISC processor known as the Emotion Engine which operates at 294 MHz (300 MHz in later consoles). The CPU heavily relies on its integration with two vector processing units, known as VPU0 and VPU1, the Graphics Synthesizer, and a floating-point unit (FPU) in order to render 3D graphics. Other components, such as the system's DVD-ROM optical drive and DualShock 2 controller, provide the software and user control input. PlayStation 2 software is distributed on CD-ROM and DVD-ROM. In addition, the console can play audio CDs and DVD movies, and is backwards compatible with original PlayStation games. This is accomplished through the inclusion of the original PlayStation's CPU which also serves as the PS2's I/O processor. The PS2 also supports limited functionality with the original PlayStation memory cards and controllers. The PS2's DualShock 2 controller is an upgraded version of the PlayStation's DualShock with analog face, shoulder and D-pad buttons replacing the digital buttons of the original. Like its predecessor, the DualShock 2 controller features force feedback technology. The standard PlayStation 2 memory card has an 8 MB capacity and uses Sony's MagicGate encryption. This requirement prevented the production of memory cards by third parties who did not purchase a MagicGate license. Memory cards without encryption can be used to store PlayStation game saves, but PlayStation games would be unable to read from or write to the card such a card could only be used as a backup. There are a variety of non-Sony manufactured memory cards available for the PlayStation 2, allowing for a larger memory capacity than the standard 8 MB. However their use is unsupported and compatibility is not guaranteed. These memory cards can have up to 128 MB storage space. The console also features USB and IEEE 1394 expansion ports. Compatibility with USB and IEEE 1394 devices is dependent on the software supporting the device. For example, the PS2 BIOS will not boot an ISO image from a USB flash drive or operate a USB printer, as the machine's operating system does not include this functionality. By contrast, Gran Turismo 4 and Tourist Trophy are programmed to save screenshots to a USB mass storage device and print images on certain USB printers. A PlayStation 2 HDD can be installed via the expansion bay in the back of the console, and was required to play certain games, notably the popular Final Fantasy XI.

The name of the loch comes from the Scots Gaelic word Caer meaning fort and wark the old Scots language word for work. There are four artificial islets in the loch showing evidence of fortification and settlement, Ash Island is thought to be a crannog. Several archaeological finds have been retrieved from the loch including a bronze cauldron, sword and pan and two dugout canoes. Carlingwark Lane Canal is a 1.5 mile canal which opened between the loch and the River Dee, 1.5 miles away in 1765. It remained in use until its abandonment in about 1840, allowing flat-bottomed boats to transport shell- marl to farms along the route. There is a footpath around the loch and it is popular for bird watching and fishing. As of 5 March 2012 the loch and the land around it has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest on account of its varied birdlife and grassland. In 1903 the loch was surveyed by E.R. Watson and later charted as part of The Bathymetrical Survey of Fresh- Water Lochs of Scotland 1897‚Äì1909. In 2009 an aerating fountain was installed at a cost of ¬£10,000 to try to prevent the build-up of blue-green algae. The funding was provided by South West Scotland Environmental Action Trust. The installation of the fountain was part of a wider development of Carlingwark Outdoor Activity Centre by Dumfries and Galloway Council. However, further research showed that, owing to the relatively shallow depth of the loch, the fountain is ineffective and its use was discontinued. Barley straw, added twice a year, has been used very successfully up to 2019 to reduce the blue- green algae levels.

Background \\"Tonight I Could Fall in Love\\" was written by Richard Gower and was produced by English producer Mickie Most, the owner of RAK Records. It was Quatro's only 1985 release, which failed to enter the UK Top 100. Following the limited success of the 1982 album Main Attraction, Quatro found herself without a label. During 1984, Quatro returned to London to record a new album, despite not having a record company. Quatro convinced Tuckey, her husband and collaborator, that they should go ahead with making an album, and then try to gain the interest of a label once it was completed. They booked RAK Studios for two weeks, with Quatro writing and Tuckey producing. Every single track recorded was original except for \\"Oh Suzi Q\\" which was written by Dale Hawkins. Quatro wrote one song about her daughter Laura, who was born in 1982, titled \\"Everything I Ever Wanted,\\" while other songs recorded during the two- week session were \\"Pardon Me,\\" \\"There She Goes,\\" \\"I'm a Rocker,\\" \\"Strange Encounters,\\" Comes the Night,\\" \\"Starry Night,\\" Good Girl Looking for a Bad Time,\\" (which was written for nanny Michelle), \\"Secret Hideaway\\" and \\"Just Like Mama,\\" the latter which was from Quatro's first tour with Slade in 1972. After the recording sessions, Quatro and Tuckey failed to secure a deal for the album, which remained unreleased until 1998 when it came out on the Connoisseur Collection label titled Unreleased Emotion. During the RAK studio sessions, Mickie Most would pop in and out assisting with the mixes, and it was decided for Quatro and Most to do a couple of songs together. \\"Tonight I Could Fall in Love\\" would be the single, coupled with \\"Good Girl (Looking for a Bad Time)\\" as the B-Side. The only other song to see light from the sessions was \\"I'm a Rocker\\", which was the b-side to Quatro's previous 1984 single \\"I Go Wild\\". The single received limited promotion overall and had no music video. Release The single was released via 7\\" and 12\\" vinyl through RAK Records in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany only. The single featured the b-side \\"Good Girl (Looking for a Bad Time)\\" which was written by Quatro and her guitarist/then husband Len Tuckey. It was also produced by Most. The b-side was exclusive to the single, although it would later appear on the 1998 Connoisseur Collection album Unreleased Emotion. The 12\\" vinyl was issued with the same b-side but an extended six-minute version of \\"Tonight I Could Fall in Love\\" as the featured song. Both 7\\" and 12\\" releases included artwork, a full colour picture sleeve, which featured a photograph of Quatro against some window blinds. The only difference between the artwork of the 7\\" and the 12\\" release, was that the blinds gave off blue light on the 7\\" vinyl release whilst it gave off a green colour on the 12\\" vinyl release. The photography was handled by Paul Forrester, whilst Quatro's hair and make-up was done by Clancy Valentina. Following the original release as a non-album single, the song would later appear as a bonus track on the 2012 CD re-issue of the Unreleased Emotion album from 1998.

Cave diving  Hasenmayer began his cave diving career in 1957 at the age of fifteen, exploring the Falkensteiner H√∂hle near Stuttgart. Beginning in the 1960s, Hasenmayer explored many karst springs and caves in the Swabian Jura and elsewhere in Southern Germany, including the Wimsener H√∂hle, the Aachtopf and the Blautopf. He became famous in 1985 due to the discovery of the M√∂rikedom (\\"M√∂rike Cathedral\\", named after Eduard M√∂rike), the second big air-filled chamber in the Blauh√∂hle, about into the cave system. Some of his terminuses (farthest point reached in a cave) have not been exceeded. In the late 1970s, Hasenmayer was among the divers who searched for an underwater connection between Kingsdale Master Cave and Keld Head in the Yorkshire Dales. On 5 February 1978 Hasenmayer briefly became trapped in Keld Head. A British diver, Geoff Yeadon, shook Hasenmayer's hand through a gap in the cave, believing he was \\"shaking a dead man's hand\\", but Hasenmayer found his way out. The passage where the incident occurred became known as \\"Dead Man's Handshake\\". Hasenmayer spent decades developing the necessary diving equipment for his explorations. Well known as a safety fanatic, Hasenmayer has introduced unique practices perceived by some cave divers as safe, but which contradict the basic rules of normal diving. Hasenmayer was a pioneer in the use of trimix breathing gas mixtures (adding helium to oxygen and nitrogen). Hasenmayer and American cave diver Sheck Exley became friends and rivals in the 1980s, each repeatedly attempting to break the depth records of the other. In 1981 Hasenmayer used mixed gas to reach a depth of in the Fountain of Vaucluse in France. Hasenmayer made the world's first dive in the Fountain of Vaucluse on 9 September 1982, diving after dark because he had been denied a diving permit. His then-wife, Barbara, waited all night for him to surface.Finch, pp. 15-16. In 1983 Hasenmayer made a mixed-gas cave dive to at Vaucluse. Due to a faulty depth gauge, in 1989 Hasenmayer surfaced too quickly after a dive in the Wolfgangsee, a lake in Austria. His short decompression resulted in the bends, causing paralysis, but his colleagues immediately placed him in a waiting decompression chamber, and initially the paralysis was reversed. However, the emergency physicians at the hospital in Graz again decompressed Hasenmayer too quickly. Since that time he has been a paraplegic. Hasenmayer did not give up diving, but since 1996 has used a submersible, the Speleonaut, designed and built by Hasenmayer and his friend Konrad Gehringer, to explore the Blauh√∂hle. In 2001 Hasenmayer reached the M√∂rikedom chamber of the Blauh√∂hle in the Speleonaut. In 2004 he reached a point beyond the M√∂rikedom into the mountain. In the same year he discovered two more large chambers in the Blauh√∂hle: the Mittelschiff (or \\"nave\\") and the √Ñonendom. For the last several years the Blautopf cave system has been explored by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Blautopf (Blautopf Study Group, or Consortium), a team of cave divers led by Hasenmayer. The most recent fatal accident in the Blautopf occurred in 2003, killing Bernd Aspacher, a member of Hasenmayer's team. Hasenmayer developed a controversial theory on the subject of karst formation in Southern Germany. According to this theory, the Blauh√∂hle was formed between 25 million and 100 million years ago, much earlier than is currently believed. Therefore, the Blauh√∂hle could not drain to the original Danube Valley, today the Blau, and must have drained much farther south. Since these caves are deep enough to contain large quantities of thermal water, this could lead to the recovery of geothermal energy which could be used to solve energy problems in Southern Germany. As an indication of the cave's age, Hasenmayer claimed that underwater stalactites at the back of the cave were several million years old, but scientific investigation of a drip stone yielded an age of well under 10,000 years. Hasenmayer's theory was published in 1986. Many scientists were skeptical of his theory. Among the public, however, the fascination with Hasenmayer's charismatic personality is still unbroken, not least because of his overwhelmingly positive media coverage. Hasenmayer has been awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.  Personal life  Hasenmayer met his life partner Gaby Barth at a clinic during his rehabilitation from his decompression accident. They live in Birkenfeld, near Pforzheim.

Named after Hence Pontoh, the Indonesian dive guide from Bunaken (Manado) who first brought these pygmy seahorses to attention. Description The weedy pygmy seahorse is a small fish which can reach a maximum length of approximately 1.7 cm, which makes it one of the smallest representatives of the seahorses. The body is small and slender with a prehensile tail. The head is relatively large, it represents about 25% of the size of the body. The eyes are prominent. It has a moderately long snout and this later does not have any bulbous tip. The coronet rises rearwardly creating a kind of angle when the animal's profile is observed. The trunk and tail may also have some small bulbs. The coronet and the widest part of the back can have some red distinctive branching filaments. The body background color is whitish with a yellow to pinkish color on the head and backside of its body. Thin red lines may also extend from the starting point of the cutaneous filaments from its back. The tail has also some red bands. Distribution and habitat The Pontoh's pygmy seahorse has been recorded from central Indo-Pacific area in eastern Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. This pygmy seahorse likes reef wall exposed to current and rich in Halimeda plants or hydroids Aglaophenia cupressina between 11 and 25 meters depth. Biology The weedy pygmy seahorse has a carnivorous diet and feeds on small crustaceans and other planktonic organisms. The species is ovoviviparous, and it is the male who broods the eggs in its ventral brood pouch. The latter includes villi rich in capillaries that surround each fertilized egg creating a sort of placenta supplying the embryos. When fully grown, pups are expelled from the pocket and become autonomous. Conservation status This species population may be vulnerable to the loss of meadows of Halimedadue to the acidification of oceans, however, it can use other habitats and is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN.

Sony released a Linux-based operating system for the PS2 in a package that also includes a keyboard, mouse, Ethernet adapter and HDD. Currently, Sony's online store states that the Linux kit is no longer for sale in North America. However, as of July 2005, the European version was still available. The kit boots by installing a proprietary interface, the run-time environment, which is on a region-coded DVD, so the European and North America kits only work with a PS2 from their respective regions. In Europe and Australia, the PS2 came with a free Yabasic interpreter on the bundled demo disc for some time. This allows simple programs to be created for the PS2 by the end-user. This was included in a failed attempt to circumvent a UK tax by defining the console as a \\"computer\\" if it contained certain software. A port of the NetBSD project and BlackRhino GNU/Linux, an alternative Debian-based distribution, are also available for the PS2. Using homebrew programs (e.g. 'SMS Media Player'Simple Media System for PlayStation 2 ‚Äì http://home.casema.nl/eugene_plotnikov/) it is possible to listen to various audio file formats (MP3, OMA, Ogg Vorbis, AAC, FLAC, AC3), and watch various video formats (DivX/XviD, MPEG1, MPEG2, MPEG4-ASP in AVI Container) using the console. Media can be played from any device connected to the console i.e. external USB/FireWire/thumb drive/hard disk drive (FAT32 only), the internal hard disk on early revision consoles, optical CD-R(W)/DVD¬±R(W) disks (modded systems or patched disks), or network shares (Windows Network or PS2 host: protocol). Homebrew programs can be launched directly from a memory card on unmodified consoles by using certain software that takes advantage of a long known and used exploit, dealing with the boot part of the EE/IOP process (Independence). A more recent development (May 2008) called Free McBoot allows homebrew programs to be launched without a trigger disc required by the older exploit. This also allows use of homebrew on unmodded systems without a functional disc drive. However, installation of the exploit to each individual memory card requires either an already exploited/modded system in order to launch the installer, or boot image that can load an app that loads ELF files (network adapter and hard drive also required). Copying from one memory card to another will not work. This newer exploit will not work on the very newest PS2s (SCPH-9000x model with BIOS 2.30 and up) but will work on all models prior to that. The newest versions of Free McBoot, version 1.90 and newer, also have the ability to install and boot from both Sony and non-Sony HDDs when using a \\"fat\\" PS2 and network adapter.FMCB 1.9 series release thread - http://psx-scene.com/forums/f153/fmcb-v1-9-series- release-thread-116247/ This support is called Free HDBoot or FHDB. With a few minor issues, it is now possible to game entirely from the HDD, without needing to use the optical disc drive nor a physical memory card. Homebrew programs can be used to play patched backups of original PS2 DVD games on unmodified consoles, and to install retail discs to an installed hard drive on older models (ESR, HD Loader, HD Advance, Open PS2 Loader). Homebrew emulators of older computer and gaming systems have been developed for the PS2.PS2 Emulators ‚Äì http://www.sksapps.com/index.php?page=emus.html A new exploit (June 2020) called FreeDVDBoot allows homebrew programs and game backups to be launched from a burned DVD from the disc drive. This makes it really convenient to run homebrew and game backups with ease, more conveniently for the newer slim models that don't have any easy way of doing so. It is currently compatible with all PS2 Slim models. It works on certain DVD Player versions of the PS2 as of right now, and will eventually be ported to all DVD Player versions which will allow all PS2 Fat models to run the exploit. This exploit also makes it easier than ever to install Free McBoot onto a memory card or Free HDBoot onto a hard drive without having to use another method of doing so. The exploit tricks the PS2 into thinking it's reading a DVD movie when it's really booting a game backup or homebrew program, similarly to how ESR does. With uLaunchELF being the initial program that is launched, the user can have multiple homebrew programs on the disc or on a connected FAT32 formatted USB device that can be launched on the console.

The raid started in conjunction with the preparation for the Siege of Pskov. It was a diversionary measure to protect the main Polish‚ÄìLithuanian forces at Pskov from a Russian attack. Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç's cavalry raided deep into the Grand Duchy of Moscow, reaching the Upper Volga. That made the raid one of the most distant Lithuanian raids. The raid was successful: Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç's men gained much loot, protected the main Polish‚ÄìLithuanian forces, and contributed to Tsar Ivan IV agreeing to negotiate the Truce of Jam Zapolski. Campaign On July 10, 1581, while preparing for the Siege of Pskov, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Stephen Bathory convened a military council. It was decided to send a cavalry regiment, commanded by Krzysztof Miko≈Çaj Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, into Orsha region and further. On August 5, Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç departed Vitebsk with about 4,000 men, which included the core of about 1,000 personal soldiers of Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç and a company of his father, Great Hetman Miko≈Çaj \\"the Red\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. Initially, Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç's men raided Orsha region. Near Toropets, Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç's regiment was joined by mercenary and Cossack cavalry units of Filon Kmita, Voivode of Smolensk. The combined forces numbered some 6,000 soldiers. Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç's men invaded and looted Smolensk region. Near the Shelom River, they faced two Muscovite armies. One was destroyed and the other's attacks were successfully repelled. Later Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç invaded Rzhev area, crossed the Volga River, burned Urdoma, and moved towards Staritsa where at that time Tsar Ivan IV was residing. On September 14, Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç was just three or four miles from Staritsa. Ivan evacuated his wife and children as well as the state treasury deeper into the Russian territory. However, Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç did not dare to attack Staritsa, one of the few brick fortresses in Russia, and retreated towards Lake Ilmen. On their way, Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç's men scored a victory near Toropets and ransacked Staraya Russa. On October 22, 1581, Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç reached besieged Pskov and rejoined the main Polish‚ÄìLithuanian forces. Aftermath The Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç expedition burned six cities and numerous villages, took much loot and many prisoners. At Pskov they were greeted as victors. Soon the siege of Pskov turned into a passive blockade and Ivan IV sent a delegation to start peace negotiations. The raid was lauded in many contemporary poems by Pranci≈°kus Gradovskis (Franciszek Gradowski), Jan Kochanowski, Elijas Pilgrimovijus (Elijah Pielgrzymowski), Andrius Rim≈°a (Andrzej Rymsza), and Jonas Radvanas (Jan Radwan). The raid earned Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç his 'thunderbolt' nickname.

In: The New Grove Dictionary of Opera. London & New York, Macmillan, 1997.  Life and career  Born Marie Ledant to a working-class family in the Marais area of the French capital, she was orphaned aged 15 months, and she and her sister grew up first with her maternal grandmother in Longjumeau. Then from 1881 she lived with her paternal grandparents, who ran the 'Caf√© du Panorama' near Meudon station, while she attended a convent school.P√®re-Lachaise entry for Marie Delna, accessed 24 July 2013. Her grandmother started her with singing lessons and she studied with Rosine Laborde. She began appearing at public auditions and various private concerts in Paris.Chabrier E, Correspondance. Ed Delage R, Durif F. Klincksieck, 1994. 92-27n, quoting Bruneau on a dinner at the house of Georges Charpentier. She was spotted by Carvalho, director of Op√©ra-Comique, who suggested her stage name (a rough anagram of her surname). In June 1892, she made a sensational stage debut, just after her 17th birthday, as Didon in Les Troyens √† Carthage.Noel E & Stoullig E. Les Annales du Th√©√¢tre et de la Musique, 18√®me ann√©e, 1892. Biblioth√®que Charpentier, Paris, 1893, p.104-109. Massenet chose her as his first Charlotte in Werther in Paris, in January 1893, and later that year she created Marceline in Bruneau's L'attaque du moulin. The following April she sang the role of Mistress Quickly in the first French Falstaff, supervised by Verdi, and continued to play the role at the Salle Favart.Wolff, St√©phane. Un demi-si√®cle d'Op√©ra-Comique 1900‚Äì1950. Andr√© Bonne, Paris, 1953. She sang Marion in Godard's La Vivandi√®re many times in her career, from its 1895 French premiere at the Op√©ra-Comique and subsequent revivals there to a production at the Ga√Æt√©-Lyrique. In 1896, Delna sang Orph√©e in the first Op√©ra-Comique production of the Berlioz-Viardot version of Gluck‚Äôs opera, to which she returned in 1900 and 1912. Delna took part in the first Covent Garden performance of L‚Äôattaque du moulin in 1894. Her Italian debut was in 1897 in Milan. In May 1898 she moved for a short while from the Op√©ra-Comique for the Paris Op√©ra, where she was Fid√®s in Le proph√®te and returned to Berlioz as Cassandre in the Paris premiere of La prise de Troie. She also sang La favorite and Samson et Dalila, as well as creating Gin√®vra in Victorin de Jonci√®res's Lancelot. Back at the Salle Favart in 1900 she sang Carmen for the first time, alongside Adolphe Mar√©chal and Hector Dufranne. Along with Orph√©e, Carmen was the role which featured most prominent for the rest of her stage career. April 1901 saw her creating Marianne in Bruneau's L‚ÄôOuragan. A revival of Falstaff in honour of Verdi's memory featured her as Quickly and she portrayed F√©e Grignotte (the witch) in H√§nsel und Gretel. In 1902 she sang Margared for the first time, partnering L√©on Beyle and Julie Guiraudon, in the revival of Le roi d'Ys. In 1903, while taking part as Carmen at the Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie in Brussels, she married a Belgian admirer, the Marquis Prier de Sa√¥ne, an industrialist, and retired from the stage. She later resumed her career with several concerts then productions at the Th√©√¢tre-Lyrique de la Ga√Æt√© as La Vivandi√®re, Orph√©e and in L'attaque du moulin. The following season she sang Fid√®s and L√©onore (La favorite).Stoullig E. Les Annales du Th√©√¢tre et de la Musique, 35eme √©dition, 1909. G Charpentier et Cie, Paris, 1910, p320-328. Delna made her Metropolitan Opera d√©but as Orfeo conducted by Toscanini, but other appearances were curtailed for various reasons. The next stage of her career included more performances of L‚Äôattaque du moulin in 1910, the creation of Tilli in La L√©preuse by Sylvio Lazzari (1912), and further performances at La Monnaie. During her career Delna performed at major houses such as La Monnaie, Covent Garden, La Scala, Teatro Lirico Milan, Metropolitan New York, Opera de Monte-Carlo and the Teatro Regio (Parma).Gourret J. Dictionnaire des Cantatrices de l'Op√©ra. Editions Albatros, Paris, 1987, p66. During the First World War she sang widely in concerts for troops, then in November 1925 appeared in the premiere of Maurin des Maures by L√©o Puget (Miss Rabasse) at the Folies-Dramatiques.Delna (Marie) Encyclop√©die multimedia de la com√©die musicale (French text), accessed 8 March 2011 Financial problems forced her to move in 1926 to a rented house in Villemomble.

Discography Delna's first recordings of operatic excerpts were set down in London in 1903 (Le proph√®te, Carmen), swiftly followed by more in Paris with La Vivandi√®re, Werther, Les Troyens. In 1905 she recorded duets with Albert Alvarez, and in 1907 more solo excerpts, this time extending to Orph√©e et Eurydice and Samson et Dalila.

Located in Austin, Texas, the school was named after General Albert Sidney Johnston, who served as Secretary of War for the Republic of Texas and as a brigadier general for the Texian Army of the Republic of Texas, the United States Army, and the Confederate States Army. From its inception in 1960, Johnston High School was well known for a wide variety of vocational and technical programs that prepared students for work in such fields as cosmetology, printing, auto mechanics, industry and business. Primarily a school for the Hispanic and African-American students of East Austin, Johnston High School grew to be a 5A school and weathered the challenges of desegregation, forced busing, and the end of desegregation. From 1988 to 2002, Johnston High School housed the signature Liberal Arts Academy, a college- preparatory liberal arts magnet program that brought students to Johnston High School from throughout the Austin Independent School District. Beginning in 2004, Johnston High School hosted International High School, a ‚Äúschool within a school‚Äù that provided an intensive English program for ninth- and tenth- grade immigrant and refugee students who were bused to Johnston High School from throughout Austin. In 2008, Johnston High School was the first school in Texas to be closed and reconstituted under the accountability system of Texas Education Agency Commissioner Robert Scott.  School Information  = School Name = In 1958, the Austin School Board approved the construction of a new high school in East Austin, some 3,000 feet from a bend in the Colorado River. Construction on the facility‚Äîoriginally named Riverside High School‚Äîbegan in 1959. The program for the school's 25th jubilee in 1985 suggests that the school was named Riverside High School ‚Äúpartly because it was on the [Colorado] river, but also because there was a well-known high school in Fort Worth at the time named Riverside High School.‚ÄùJohnston High School 25th Jubilee Program The school's 1985 yearbook similarly shares, ‚ÄúWhile under construction, Johnston was called Riverside High School because it was near the Colorado River. Things soon changed. ‚ÄòRiver rats‚Äô wasn‚Äôt an appropriate nickname [for a mascot].‚ÄùThe Confederate [the yearbook of A.S. Johnston High School], 1985, page 2. The 1985 jubilee program confirms that even before the school was opened, ‚Äúthe nickname ‚ÄòRiverside Rats‚Äô was already being applied. So several students at Allan Junior High, who would be coming to the new high school, petitioned the school board to change the name. Besides, hidden in the school board regulations was a ruling that stated that all schools in Austin must be named for a person and that person must be dead.‚ÄùJohnston High School 25th Jubilee Program Students of Allan Junior High submitted a list of possible names for a renamed school. The list of possible names that came before the Austin School Board included such heroes as David Crockett, John H. Reagan, Sidney Lanier, and Albert Sidney Johnston, an American Civil War hero buried in Austin. Board minutes reflect that the school board ceded to the request of future students to change the name of the school to honor ‚Äúsome historical or educational figure such as the other high schools of the city.‚Äù Three names were ultimately considered by the Board: Davy Crockett High School, Coronado High School, and Albert Sidney Johnston High School. Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston With heightened activities focused on the centennial celebration of the American Civil War (1860-1865), the school was renamed after Albert Sidney Johnston, an American Civil War general buried at the Texas State Cemetery, 3.5 miles west of the school. The next two high schools built by the Austin Public Schools during the centennial celebration would also be named for Confederate heroes: Sidney Lanier High School (which opened in 1961) and John H. Reagan High School (which opened in 1965), prompting some to speculate that the naming of these three schools for Confederate heroes was a \\"push to glorify the Confederacy as a deliberate slap in the face to minorities and the federal government after the 1954 Supreme Court school desegregation decision Brown v. Board of Education.\\" It seems that Albert Sidney Johnston, a native- Kentuckian, was relatively unknown at that time. In an Austin Statesman article entitled, ‚ÄúYes, Ma‚Äôm, He‚Äôs Texan,‚Äù Anita Brewer wrote, ‚ÄúSome Austinites are perplexed about this man, Johnston. Just who was this fellow? Why was he important enough for the Austin Board of Education and the future students of Austin‚Äôs new eastside high school to scuttle a perfectly good name like 'Riverside' to name the school for Johnston? The School Board voted unanimously Monday night to rename the new school the Albert Sidney Johnston High School‚Ä¶. Historians are cheering the board‚Äôs decision as a fine one and a belated and overdue tribute to one of the greatest of the early Texans.‚ÄùAustin Statesman, August 1960 A photo of Johnston's tomb at the Texas State Cemetery was featured in the newspaper, with the caption, ‚ÄúJohnston interest is revived as School Board names new high school for famed Confederate.‚Äù With Founding Principal Gordon Bailey's death thirty years later, on January 27, 1990, alumni rallied to rename Johnston High School for their longtime principal of happy memory. In May 1990, a petition was brought by alumni to the Board of Trustees of the Austin Independent School District, to rename the school for Bailey. The school's newspaper reported: ‚Äú‚ÄòPapa Bailey,‚Äô as he was affectionately called, often met his students at the door each day. His devotion to the school was deep, working weekends and coming in to help do school repairs himself. It is this kind of spirit that moved his alumni to attempt to honor him with a renaming of the school [to which] he gave so much. But many students now attending Johnston reacted with disbelief and protest. ‚ÄòWhen you take the name, you also take our identity,‚Äô Joy A. Foster said.‚Äù‚ÄúName change issue to be resolved: Board to determine fate of school‚Äôs name after public hearing,‚Äù by Rochelle Hayes, printed in Shiloh [the school newspaper of A.S. Johnston High School], vol. 30, no. 6, May 31, 1990. The Board did not rename the school for Bailey in 1990, but broke ground in 1992 for a middle school in Austin named in Bailey‚Äôs memory. The Johnston Rams Legacy Hall at Eastside Memorial High School in Austin, Texas In 2008, Johnston High School was the first high school in Texas to be closed under a new state accountability system. In August 2008, a new high school, Eastside Memorial High School, was opened in the same facility. In 2009, the school was divided into two campuses: Eastside Green Tech and Eastside Global Tech. On May 23, 2011, partly to honor the legacy of Johnston High School, the school was renamed Eastside Memorial High School at the Johnston Campus. Memorabilia from Johnston High School can be found at the Johnston Rams Legacy Hall, located inside the cafeteria of Eastside Memorial High School at the Johnston Campus. = School Colors = Confederate heroes & flags, with Albert Sidney Johnston pictured in the bottom row (second to the left). Note that the primary colors of the Confederate flags are scarlet and Columbia blue, the colors of A.S. Johnston High School in Austin, Texas. The Johnston High School colors were scarlet and Columbia blue, colors often associated with the flags of the Confederate States of America. The program for the school‚Äôs 25th jubilee shares that ‚Äústudents of the new school chose everything. It was their school‚Äù and that the choice of Columbia blue was ‚Äúsomewhat rare as a school color at the time.‚ÄùJohnston High School 25th Jubilee Program The choice of Columbia blue is interesting insofar as Confederate flags typically contain navy blue; a lighter blue, similar to Columbia blue, was contained in the Second Confederate Navy Jack (1863-1865). School spirit often centered around ‚Äúthe Red & Blue,‚Äù and various school programs and events incorporated the colors. = School Songs = The Johnston High School song, or alma mater, was ‚ÄúLoyal Hearts,‚Äù which was sung to the tune of Jean Sibelius‚Äô ‚ÄúFinlandia.‚Äù The words were: ‚ÄúWith loyal hearts, we hail our alma mater, praising her name for all the world to hear. Her colors fly up in the sky triumphantly and wave us on to glorious victory. Her Red & Blue, her spirits true do testify of (or ‚Äòto‚Äô) praises sung for mighty Johnston High!‚Äù The lyrics are attributed to Jacqueline McGee, an English teacher & yearbook sponsors at Johnston High School, who would later become the school's first Dean of Girls, then Austin‚Äôs first woman principal, first at Burnet Junior High and later at Stephen F. Austin High School. The program for the school‚Äôs 25th jubilee in 1985 notes that ‚Äúthe tradition of linking little fingers during the school song was, according to Mr. Bailey, a common tradition among high schools at the time and a symbol of unity among the students.‚ÄùJohnston High School 25th Jubilee Program Johnston also had a fight song entitled ‚ÄúFighting Rams.‚Äù Its lyrics were: ‚ÄúWe are the Rams of Johnston High. Invincible we stand, united in our praises of the best school in the land. Let‚Äôs give a cheer, a rousing cheer. Let‚Äôs fight to win the game. In victory, we‚Äôll crown our school with glory and fame. Let‚Äôs fight! Let‚Äôs fight! For Johnston High, let‚Äôs fight! Let‚Äôs fight for the Red & Blue and victory tonight! Go! Fight! Go, Rams! Go!‚Äù = School Mascot = The mascot of Johnston High School was the ram. The program for the school's 25th jubilee in 1985 shares that ‚Äústudents of the new school chose everything. It was their school, ‚Ä¶and the principal, Mr. Bailey, was determined that they should have a voice in selecting everything from its mascot to its yearbook name.‚ÄùJohnston High School 25th Jubilee Program The school's 1985 yearbook shares that ‚Äúrumors circulate that a ram was selected since a ram once roamed free around the school when it was first built and nothing but cow pastures surrounded the school. Another version accounting for the name was that since the Los Angeles Rams were a popular and powerful football team at the time Johnston was seeking a mascot, the Rams were a likely choice.‚ÄùThe Confederate [the yearbook of A.S. Johnston High School], 1985, page 2. The program for the school's 25th jubilee confirms, ‚ÄúThe students selected the Ram as their mascot because the Los Angeles Rams were a powerful football team at the time.‚ÄùJohnston High School 25th Jubilee Program The head of King Ramses I (the former mascot of Johnston High School in Austin, Texas) which used to hang in the office of the school School yearbooks suggest that during the school's first year, the Fall Student Council led an effort to purchase a ram, named ‚ÄúKing Ramses I,‚Äù which accompanied students to athletic competitions. During the school's second year, the Boys‚Äô Service Club was formed to take care of the mascot and to transport it to and from athletic competitions. After the death of King Ramses I in 1964, the Boys‚Äô Service Club mounted its head in the front hall of the school, and a new mascot by the same name was purchased. The program for the school's 25th jubilee in 1985 offers a slightly different history: that ‚Äúmany high schools had live mascots in the 60‚Äôs, and Johnston was no exception. A live ram was given to the school by a student‚Äôs father; he was promptly named Ramses. He was kept at a student‚Äôs house, but he went to all football games. At one game, another team was represented by a live horse with a student rider. The horse was spooked by Ramses and nearly threw his rider. The school board then ruled that no school could have a live mascot. So Johnston had to get rid of Ramses! A student group at the time, perhaps the Boys‚Äô Club, decided to slaughter him and use the cooked meat as a fundraiser. The feast was held at a local restaurant, and Ramses‚Äô head was stuffed and mounted and hung in the main hall of Johnston. The head was taken down in 1983 because of its dirtied condition and is being cleaned.‚ÄùJohnston High School 25th Jubilee Program The program continues: ‚ÄúAfter the demise of Ramses, the school was adopted by a second ‚Äòmascot.‚Äô A small black-and-white dog decided he would be Johnston's mascot, guard dog, and general care-taker. His name seems to be lost in the caverns of individual memories; some people claim he was called ‚ÄòRamsey,‚Äô others ‚ÄòRamses II,‚Äô and others say he was simply ‚ÄòRam.‚Äô At any rate, he was allowed to roam the halls and eat in the cafeteria. He had enough sense not to disturb classes, and the students had enough sense not to take him to football games. Ramsey and Johnston were very happy together until‚Äîone day, the circus came to town. And when the circus left, Ramsey was gone. Whether he was dog-napped, was killed, or voluntarily left for excitement and adventure was never known. But Johnston has not had a live mascot since.‚ÄùJohnston High School 25th Jubilee Program \\"Rambo,\\" the later mascot of Johnston High School. The school later purchased the costume of a ram for a new mascot, which was named ‚ÄúRambo\\" after the protagonist John Rambo in the 1980s film series starring Sylvester Stallone. By 2001, the costume had suffered enough wear that a new Rambo costume was purchased. Because the school mascot was the ram, the school was often referred to as ‚ÄúRamland,‚Äù and students and athletes alike were often referred to as Rams and Ramettes.  History  = Opening = In 1958, the Austin School Board approved a new high school in East Austin for students graduating from the nearby Allan Junior High School, which desegregated that same year. Construction on the facility‚Äîoriginally named Riverside High School‚Äîbegan in 1959. In 1960, with heightened activity focused on the centennial celebration of the American Civil War (1860-1865), the school was renamed after Albert Sidney Johnston, a Civil War general buried at the Texas State Cemetery, 3.5 miles west of the school. Albert Sidney Johnston High School opened in 1960 under the leadership of Austin Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Irby B. Carruth and Johnston High School Principal Gordon A. Bailey, who led the school for 12 years. The school's 1985 Jubilee program notes that Johnston High School was opened in February 1960 with a single administrator, Mr. Bailey, overseeing the education of 325 sophomores and juniors.Johnston High School 25th Jubilee Program The following Fall, another administrator, Vice Principal Wallace Dockall, was added to help oversee the growing student body, which now comprised sophomores, juniors and seniors. Albert Sidney Johnston High School graduated its first senior class of 80 students in 1961. In the Fall of 1962, the ninth-grade class was moved from Allan Junior High School, making Johnston High School a full, four-year high school. = Desegregation & Resegregation = The desegregation of public schools in Austin was a long and arduous process. The U.S. Department of Education had accepted the district's plan for desegregation in 1955, but the plan was still not implemented in 1966. In 1956, 13 African-American students were integrated into Austin's ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù high schools;‚ÄúJunior High Segregation To Continue Next Year,‚Äù in The Austin Statesman, May 15, 1956. integration did not occur at the junior high level until 1958 when the first African-American student was integrated into the ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù Allan Junior High School, near Johnston High School.‚ÄúUp 1003: Schools Open For 27,505,‚Äù in The Austin American, September 3, 1958. The first integration of faculty in Austin did not occur until 1964 when world history teacher William Akins (after whom Akins High School in the Austin Independent School District is named) was the first African-American teacher to be integrated at Johnston High School. Akins was one of three teachers to be integrated into ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù schools in 1964, with the other two, B.T. Snell and Narveline Drennan, being assigned to teach at the nearby Allan Junior High School.‚ÄúAustin Faculty Is Integrated,‚Äù in The Austin American, September 11, 1964. In July 1971, after various failed attempts by the Austin ISD to desegregate its schools, a U.S. District Court judge ordered the immediate implementation of a busing plan that would transport over 13,000 Austin students to integrated schools at a cost of more than $1 million.‚ÄúLocal Integration Scheme Wins Nod,‚Äù in The Austin American, July 20, 1971. Two pages of the 1972 Johnston High School yearbook were dedicated to largely negative reactions to busing by students.The Confederate [the yearbook of A.S. Johnston High School], 1972, pages 4-5. One student was reported as saying, ‚ÄúThey ought to hang [busing] up. It‚Äôs not contributing to education. It‚Äôs just causing more hatred amongst the Black and White pupils because they can‚Äôt get along with each other.‚ÄùThe Confederate [the yearbook of A.S. Johnston High School], 1972, page 5. The same yearbook reported that violent incidents erupted ‚Äúas well as some well-spread rumors of upcoming violence,‚ÄùThe Confederate [the yearbook of A.S. Johnston High School], 1972, page 127. and that ‚Äúthousands of students stayed away from school on May 1 [1972], which was being called ‚ÄòBloody Monday,‚Äô because of expected violence on local [Austin] campuses.‚ÄùThe Confederate [the yearbook of A.S. Johnston High School], 1972, page 124. While forced busing was appealed through the courts, the school‚Äôs 1974 yearbook reported a great deal of persistent segregation. A White world geography teacher shared, ‚ÄúThe browns sit together, the blacks sit together, and the whites sit by me.‚ÄùThe Confederate [the yearbook of A.S. Johnston High School], 1974, page 186. Other teachers observed, ‚ÄúMy students tend to segregate themselves,‚ÄùThe Confederate [the yearbook of A.S. Johnston High School], 1974, page 198. ‚Äúthere is a lot of racial prejudice but it is well contained,‚ÄùThe Confederate [the yearbook of A.S. Johnston High School], 1974, page 186. and ‚Äú[students] get along fine because all the browns sit together and all the blacks sit together. There are a few that mix.‚ÄùThe Confederate [the yearbook of A.S. Johnston High School], 1974, page 192. According to the school's 1980 yearbook, ‚Äúdesegregation, busing, rumor and question marks occupied students, faculty in winter of ‚Äô79.‚ÄùThe Confederate [the yearbook of A.S. Johnston High School], 1980. In January 1980, a series of desegregation appeals were finally settled by Judge Jack Roberts, and a tri-ethnic desegregation plan of forced busing, affirmative action hiring, and bilingual education was implemented for the Austin ISD in the Fall of 1980 with $3.4 million of emergency aid from the federal government.Robert Reinhold, ‚ÄúTexas School Principal, Contradicting Reagan, Says Federal Aid was Crucial,‚Äù The New York Times, May 22, 1983. (https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/22/us/texas-school-principal-contradicting- reagan-says-federal-aid-was-crucial.html) The school's yearbook reported, ‚ÄúThe almost decade-long desegregation case of AISD was finally coming to an end; Johnston High was in the midst of the issue. When school began, students, parents, and faculty knew of the changes coming to Johnston High School. What kind of changes? That was still not decided when school began. Yet, we decided not to wait for the final outcome of the court battles, appeals and counter- appeals.‚ÄùThe Confederate [the yearbook of A.S. Johnston High School], 1980, pages 2-3. After the court-ordered busing was effected, students were bused to Johnston from northwest, southwest and south Austin. The demographics of Johnston High School quickly and dramatically changed, as evidenced by the White faces of the school's homecoming court and the ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Who‚Äù section of its subsequent yearbooks. In 1985, the school's homecoming court was entirely White, and only one of 24 students in the ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Who‚Äù section of the yearbook had a Hispanic surname. The White editor of the 1984 yearbook shared an idyllic view of racial integration: ‚ÄúBusing would take kids from the different parts of town and all the different walks of life, and gather them all together in one school. Both parents and students alike objected to the busing. Many people went to private schools, or moved into a different school district. Those that went along with busing did suffer some, but the majority of the students had no regrets later. The Johnston Senior Class was one made up of all sorts of people and, through the years, they became very close. No integration was fully satisfied, but the Senior Class has made the first step in creating a unified bond between the different sections of the city.‚ÄùThe Confederate [the yearbook of A.S. Johnston High School], 1984, page 98. For many, Johnston High School was a model for desegregation. An April 25, 1983 article in Time magazine noted how the school used to be, in the words of Principal Adan Salgado, ‚Äúthe doormat of the district,‚Äù but that ‚Äúthe administration [subsequently] began beefing up the academic program, installing the school system‚Äôs first computer center and adding advanced courses in French, Latin, math, biology and chemistry‚Ä¶. In 1980, 90% of the students were below grade level in math; by 1982, the figure had improved to 54%.‚ÄùGuy D. Garcia, John E. Yang & Adam Agorin, ‚ÄúHope stirs in the ghetto,‚Äù in Time magazine, April 25, 1983, page 95. Johnston High School again made the news when President Ronald Reagan cited the Time magazine article during a press conference on May 17, 1983, noting how local officials were taking the initiative to transform schools without federal aid and the court-ordered desegregation that Reagan often opposed.Robert Reinhold, ‚ÄúTexas School Principal, Contradicting Reagan, Says Federal Aid was Crucial,‚Äù The New York Times, May 22, 1983, (https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/22/us/texas-school- principal-contradicting-reagan-says-federal-aid-was-crucial.html) The New York Times offered a corrective, noting that court-ordered busing and $368,000 in federal aid ‚Äútransformed the Johnston High School from a decaying slum school into an institution that has gained national attention for educational excellence.‚ÄùRobert Reinhold, ‚ÄúTexas School Principal, Contradicting Reagan, Says Federal Aid was Crucial,‚Äù The New York Times, May 22, 1983, (https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/22/us/texas-school-principal-contradicting- reagan-says-federal-aid-was-crucial.html) The paper quoted Principal Adan Salgado, who shared that President Reagan ‚Äúdid not really understand our situation. He did not have all the facts.\\"Robert Reinhold, ‚ÄúTexas School Principal, Contradicting Reagan, Says Federal Aid was Crucial,‚Äù The New York Times, May 22, 1983, (https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/22/us/texas-school- principal-contradicting-reagan-says-federal-aid-was-crucial.html) Salgado noted that the President's decision to eliminate federal funding under the Emergency School Assistance Act negatively impacted the Johnston community, which, before desegregation through busing, was ‚Äú99 percent Mexican-American and black, ‚Ä¶the ‚Äòdoormat of the district.‚Äô‚ÄùRobert Reinhold, ‚ÄúTexas School Principal, Contradicting Reagan, Says Federal Aid was Crucial,‚Äù The New York Times, May 22, 1983, (https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/22/us/texas-school- principal-contradicting-reagan-says-federal-aid-was-crucial.html) The article continued: ‚ÄúBefore that, Mr. Salgado said, his school was deteriorating badly, suffering from poor attendance, low achievement and lack of parental involvement. He said the Federal aid allowed him to keep promises to parents about school improvements. New classrooms were built, the gymnasium and locker rooms were remodeled, courses in Latin and computer sciences were added, and new band uniforms were purchased.‚ÄùRobert Reinhold, ‚ÄúTexas School Principal, Contradicting Reagan, Says Federal Aid was Crucial,‚Äù The New York Times, May 22, 1983, (https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/22/us/texas-school-principal- contradicting-reagan-says-federal-aid-was-crucial.html) The school's 1985 jubilee program shared that 55% of Johnston students at that time were bused to the school from other parts of Austin and that the school was then 50% Anglo, 30% Mexican-American and 20% African-American, ‚Äúthus reflecting the general population of Austin.‚ÄùJohnston High School 25th Jubilee Program Within seven years, desegregation ended. By 1983, the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had determined that the Austin ISD had removed all remaining vestiges of segregation and was now free from federal interventions, like the busing mandate, paving the way for the district's decision to end forced busing in 1987. The school's 1987 yearbook reported, ‚ÄúTopping the local news in 1986‚Äì87 was the Austin Independent School Board‚Äôs decision to stop desegregation. As a result of this decision, most students will be attending neighborhood schools, regardless of racial distribution. The new districting plan will make Johnston a vocational magnet school.‚ÄùThe Confederate [the yearbook of A.S. Johnston High School], 1987, page 35. By 2006, the Daily Texan would report that Austin ISD schools ‚Äúhad begun to slip into patterns of racial isolation mirroring the east-west residential divide‚Äù and that ‚ÄúAustin ISD is part of a nationwide trend of school re-segregation caused by the dismantling of court-ordered desegregation plans.‚ÄùJustin Ward, The Daily Texan, posted February 23, 2006 at: http://texasedequity.blogspot.com/2006/02/re-segregation-and-reform-in- austin.html The article pointed out that with the end of busing, the percentage of students who passed state standardized tests fell from 60% to 20%. = Vocational Education = = The Liberal Arts Academy = = International High School = = Decline & Closure =  Leadership  = Principals of Johnston High School = * Dr. Gordon A.

His brothers were Publius Valerius Publicola and Marcus Valerius Volusus. They were said to be the sons of Volesus Valerius.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.30 Appointment as dictator During the period of popular discontent in Rome which led to the First secessio plebis, the Volsci, Sabines and the Aequi took up arms against Rome at the same time. To meet the threat and because of the popular political concerns at the time, in 494 BC Valerius was appointed dictator by the Roman senate. He was said to have been chosen because of his moderate temper. His appointment was accepted by the people because of the popularity of his late brother Publius. Resolution of military affairs Valerius called for conscripts and the people responded positively. Ten legions (about 45,000 men) were raised, a greater number than had been raised previously at any one time. Four of these legions were assigned to the dictator to deal with the Sabines who were regarded as the most serious of the three military threats, and three to each of the consuls to meet the Aequi and the Volsci. Valerius marched with his army to meet the Sabines and won a victory, for which he was awarded a triumph. Additionally the honour of a curule chair in the circus maximus was given to him and his descendants.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.31 Secession of the plebs After the armies' return to Rome, Valerius requested the senate to deal with the ongoing debt issues which were afflicting the people. The senate declined to act, and the dictator was outraged. He said before the senate: He resigned his commission, and went to his house, greeted by the applause of the people. In some traditions, following his dictatorship, he was first elected augur in 494 BC and then princeps senatus during the census of 493 BC.

It continued to issue revenues under British and Ethiopian occupation, as well as when it became an independent state. The capital Asmara also issued some revenues. Italian colony (until 1941) Eritrea's first revenues were issued when it was still an Italian colony. There were issues for stamp duty (Marca da Bollo), bills of exchange (Marca da Bollo per Cambiali) and passports (Atti Esteri Passaporti), all of which were Italian revenues overprinted ERITREA. Apart of these there were stamps for bills of lading (Tassa Camerale sulle Polizze de Carico), which had designs with the coat of arms of Italy in the centre. These were Italian Eritrea's only revenues which were not overprints on Italy. In addition, Eritrea also used general revenue issues for use in all Italian colonies, as well as revenue stamps of Italian East Africa. British occupation (1943 to 1952) The British occupied Eritrea during World War II and introduced revenues for Eritrea in 1943. The first issue consisted of stamps of the Italian colonies overprinted ERITREAN Inland Revenue and the value in cents or shillings. These were later replaced with similar ones with the overprint reading ERITREA INLAND REVENUE. In 1944, keytypes were issued, with designs similar to the ones used in Italian Somaliland. These continued to be used until the end of the British occupation. There were also some surcharges. In 1947, the 4c keytype stamp was issued overprinted CYRENAICA P.T. 25 for use in Cyrenaica, which was also under British Military Administration. Part of Ethiopia (1952 to 1991) Ethiopian Eritrea's first revenues were British occupation keytype issues overprinted in Ethiopian dollars. These were replaced by a new issue in 1953, again using the keytypes but with the new currency inscribed on the stamp. There was another issue using the keytype in 1955, with the face values shown trilingually in Amharic, English and Arabic. These were replaced by an issue in 1960 portraying Emperor Haile Selassie I. After this, Ethiopian revenue stamps were probably used in Eritrea. Independent (since 1991) Upon becoming independent, Eritrea began to issue revenues once again. The first stamps were issued in 1991 by the Provisional Government of Eritrea, but were soon replaced by a new issue two years later in a similar design but with the inscription changed to reflect the establishment of the State of Eritrea. In 1997 a single stamp showing a fish was issued. This exists in two formats, either perforated or rouletted. Asmara (1940 to 1960) The Asmara City Hall which appeared on the city's last revenue stamps of 1960. Asmara's first revenues were issued in 1940 showing the city's coat of arms. When it was an Italian colony, two sets were issued, one for health inspection fees (Diritti Sanitari) and the other for secretariat fees (Diritti di Segretaria). When the British occupied Eritrea, Asmara issued stamps for use as general duty revenues. All were stamps of the Italian colonies overprinted Asmara Municipality Revenue, and the value was in cents or shillings. When Eritrea became part of Ethiopia, Asmara's revenues were still those of the Italian colonies overprinted. However, the overprint was now in Italian, reading Municipio Asmara, and the new values were in Ethiopian dollars. An additional two stamps were issued for Asmara in 1960. These showed the city hall and were inscribed SEGNATASSE. This usually meant postage due, however they are regarded as revenues since they were only used for fiscal purposes and were never used as postage dues.

Unlike traditional light sources such as incandescent lamps, LEDs rarely fail outright and instead continue to emit light, albeit at slowly diminishing rate over time. Lumen maintenance is the luminous flux remaining (expressed as a percentage of the initial output) at any selected elapsed operating time. Lumen depreciation is the luminous flux lost over time, and thus the complement of lumen maintenance. Lumen maintenance compares the amount of light produced from a light source or from a luminaire when it is brand new to the amount of light output at a specific time in the future. For instance, if a luminaire produced 1,000 lumens of light when it was brand new and now produces 700 lumens of light after 30,000 hours, then it would have lumen maintenance of 70% at 30,000 hours. Useful lifetime estimates for LED lighting products are typically given in terms of the expected operating hours until light output has diminished to 70% of initial levels (denoted L70 life). This percentage was favored because research indicates that most users fail to notice the slow loss of light until well after it passes the 70% mark. However, many lighting designers have pointed out that a 30% loss of light is pretty poor performance and some manufacturers have responded by providing L80, and even L90, data (that is, the life until the LED has lost 10% of its initial brightness). There are a number of methods for controlling lumen maintenance areas: * Installing photoreceptors tied directly to ballasts, controlling the voltage output to the lamps based on the set level of luminance. * Connecting dimming ballasts directly to an energy management system that has been programmed for the expected depreciation of the lamps; the energy management system directs the output of ballasts as necessary to maintain required lighting levels over time. * Manually verifying lighting levels in a space by using photometers in specific locations, and then manually setting the system to meet lighting requirements.  Lumen maintenance degradation mechanisms  One mechanism is the degradation of the LED chip due to the increase of non-radiative recombination which reduces the total number of emitted photons. The other predominant mechanism is the degradation of the optical parts under temperature or electric stresses. If an LED is in the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), then VOCs can diffuse into the gas-permeable silicone lens and encapsulants. The VOCs will occupy the free space in the molecular structure of the silicone. Once exposed to high photonic energy emitted by the LED and heat from the junction temperature, the VOCs start to discolor and deteriorate the LED, by through the phosphor layer.  Lumen maintenance standards  = IES LM-80 = IESNA LM-80 is the Department of Energy (DOE) approved testing method for measuring lumen depreciation of solid-state (LED) light sources, arrays and modules. The Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) and the Department of Energy Solid State Lighting Standards Development group worked together to create the LM-80 test criteria. The IESNA LM-80 committee is chaired by Jeff Hulett, CTO at Vektrex Electronic Systems Inc., who continues to work with the group to update and improve the LM-80 standard. Following the release of the original LM-80 standard in 2008, the LM-80 working group released two additional updates: LM-80-08 and LM-80-15. LM-80-15 expanded the standard to include radiant, photon or luminous flux maintenance. LM-80 is for inorganic LED-based packages, arrays and modules, not LED bulbs or luminaries. It mainly measures: # Lumen maintenance of light source in different temperature # Color maintenance of light source in different temperature. LM-80 specifies a minimum testing period of 6,000 hours, with 10,000 hours being the preferred testing period. LM-80 also requires testing at a minimum of 1,000-hour increments. = IES TM-21 = While LM-80 provides a standard method for testing lumen maintenance, it does not provide guidance or recommendations for predicting or extrapolating maintenance beyond the duration of these measurements. The need for this additional level of guidance was addressed in 2011 when the IES published TM-21: Lumen Degradation Lifetime Estimation Method for LED Light Sources, the IES-recommended method for projecting the lumen degradation of an LED package, array or module beyond the LM-80 test period. TM-21 is now the standard method for projecting useful LED lighting product life at realistic operating temperatures. Once the LM-80 test is complete, the resultant measurements are used to determine a depreciation curve for the luminous flux at each tested temperature. The data is used as described in TM-21 to determine the L70, L80 or L90 ‚ÄúLumen Maintenance Life Projection.‚Äù In other words, LM-80 is a testing procedure, and TM-21 is a calculation procedure.

Shiffrin's work spans issues in moral, political and legal philosophy, as well as matters of legal doctrine, that concern equality, autonomy and the social conditions for their realization. She is an associate editor of Philosophy and Public Affairs and was elected a Fellow of the American Academic of Arts and Sciences in 2010.http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/chancellor-block-7-other- ucla-157117 Education and career Shiffrin received her B.A. in philosophy from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1988, winning the University Medal. As a Marshall Scholar, she went on to obtain a B.Phil., with distinction, from University College, Oxford, in 1990. She earned a D.Phil. in philosophy at Oxford University in 1993 under the supervision of G. A. Cohen, and then a J.D. magna cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1996. She is winner of the Fred Berger Memorial Prize in Philosophy of Law in 2002 for her widely cited article, \\"Paternalism, Unconscionability, and Accommodation\\". She was also the Hempel Lecturer at Princeton University in 2012. Philosophical work Shiffrin's recent work has primarily focused on freedom of speech, truth-telling, promising, and the place of the law in building moral character. Shiffrin argues that although liberalism may preclude legal enforcement of morality for its own sake, the law cannot be indifferent to morality but must promote the social conditions of fostering and sustaining moral agency and moral deliberation. A connected theme she emphasizes is the role of equality and equal social relationships in rendering individual autonomy possible and meaningful. She has pursued these themes predominately through her non-conventionalist account of promising, her controversial argument that contract law should be more sensitive to its relationship to the moral practice of promising, her critique of luck-egalitarian conceptions of egalitarianism as incompatible with liberal freedoms that require accommodation practices, and also through the development of her thinker-based theory of freedom of speech. She is also cited for her critique of Lockean arguments for intellectual property, for her efforts to develop a non- comparative alternative theory of harm, and for her argument that the federal law authorizing exploitative penalty fees for minor breaches of credit card contracts violates constitutional due process guarantees against disproportionate punitive damages.

He played an essential role in the development of the Plant System of railroads. Haines City, Florida is named after him. Lake Haines, on the Chain of Lakes in Winter Haven, Florida is also named after him. Personal life Henry Haines was born in Nantucket, Massachusetts. However, he grew up in Savannah, Georgia. At age 21, he married Elizabeth J. Owens from Charleston, South Carolina. They had four children together. After his first wife died from yellow fever, Haines married Anna H. Davies, daughter of a prominent Episcopalian Bishop from Michigan. They had two sons together. Haines continued to work actively on the railroad until age 58. After retiring he spent several years traveling Europe. Haines died shortly before his 87th birthday, having lived to an unusually old age for that time. Business career During the 1850s, Haines worked as a railroad superintendent in South Carolina. After the outbreak of the Civil War, he joined the confederate Army, and was given the rank of Colonel. He served as a logistical officer, maintaining military transport and supply lines in the Carolinas. His work during the war mostly focused on the railroad system. By the end of the war, he was an expert on railroad construction and management. He was said to be able to \\"lay track, run an engine, mend a boiler, issue payroll, and balance the books - all in the same morning\\". After the war, having lost his fortune and wife, he was greatly discouraged. He then worked for the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad, helping to re-build the railroad system in the south. He eventually became employed by Henry Plant, as the great railroad magnate purchased many smaller railroads all across the South. Haines quickly became Plant's most trusted employee, and played an important part in the development of the Plant System of railroads. He served as a general manager and vice-president of Henry Plant's railroads, and had an office in New York City. Haines worked for Henry Plant until his retirement in 1894. Even though Haines was not college educated, he was widely considered one of the leading experts in the world on railroad construction and operation. He wrote several important academic treatises about railroads during his retirement years. His works include, \\"American Railway Management\\" published in 1897, and \\"Problems In RailRoad Regulation\\" published in 1911. Sanford-Tampa Line Haines' most notable achievement was the construction of Sanford-Tampa Line in 1883-1884. In 1883, Henry Plant acquired a charter from the state of Florida to connect Sanford, Florida and Tampa, Florida by railroad. Henry Plant had long wanted to connect the deep water, natural harbors in Tampa Bay to the national railroad system. He knew that Tampa would quickly develop into an important port city serving ships headed to Cuba and Central America. However, because of political wrangling in the state, Plant's charter was only good for seven months, from June 1883 until the end of January 1884. In order to succeed with the Sanford-Tampa Charter, Plant had to lay over of new rail road, through thick sub-tropical forests, wetlands, and swamps of central Florida before his charter expired. Plant called on Haines to oversee the entire operation in the field. Haines organized thousands of men, working together like clockwork, to complete this impressive engineering achievement. Over a thousand men were employed to just cut the vegetation and clear the land. Crews of blacksmiths and wheelwrights worked 24 hours a day to stay on schedule. Tools, heavy equipment, work materials, food, and fresh water all had to be brought to the work site as it progressed across Florida. The operation began in June 1883, right at the beginning of the rainy season. Afternoon rains would deluge the worksite, turning everything to mud. Haines and his men struggled to move forward, and finally reached Tampa Bay with just a few days to spare. The completion of this railroad line helped cement Henry Plant's dominance in the railroad industry. It also changed the history of central Florida, causing rapid growth all along the new railroad line, in towns including Orlando, Tampa, and Lakeland. Interstate Highway 4 today runs a similar course to the original railroad, passing through the same areas that originally boomed because of the new railroad construction. Plant City, Florida was established during the construction of the railroad, and was named for Henry Plant. In 1887, four years after the completion of the Sanford-Tampa Line, the village of Clay Cut was renamed Haines City, in honor of Haines, while at the same time it was awarded, by Haines, a permanent railroad station, where trains would make regular stops.

It has a length of about seventeen kilometers, and debouches into the bay Stormbukta at the western shore of Spitsbergen. The glacier front is about five kilometer long. Olsokbreen is a southern branch of the glacier Mefonna, which also has the northern branch Samarinbreen. Tributary glaciers to Olsokbreen are Kvithettbreen and Valettebreen, both coming from the east, from or between the mountains of Sn√∏krossen, Gr√•tinden, Kvithetta, Haitanna and Guilbaudtoppen. Olsokbreen is one of the 163 tidewater glaciers in Svalbard. It lies in the southernmost tip of Svalbard. Records show that between 1900-2008 the Olsokbreen has receded by 3.5 kilometers. It has gradually withdrawn from a peninsula to its north. Since 2010, however, it is the southern section of Olsokbreen that has seen more calving. Images taken in 2010 also showed that the north-south calving front has become irregular. Further images taken from 2012 showed that the open water at the north side of the glacier between the terminus and the peninsula had extended. The natural prediction from these images is that the increase in the calving front's width will bring about an increase in calving. The southern region of Svalbard.

As in many parts of Africa, there is a great amount of stigma attached to being an atheist. A 2010 poll by Pew Research Center showed that 51% of Nigerian Muslims agree with the death penalty for leaving Islam. In some parts of Nigeria, there are even anti-blasphemy laws. In 2017 the Humanist Association of Nigeria gained formal government recognition after a 17-year struggle. This was followed by recognition of the Atheist Society of Nigeria, the Northern Nigerian Humanist Association and the Nigerian Secular Society. Case of Mubarak Bala Mubarak Bala, a Nigerian atheist, who was born in Kano State, Northern Nigeria in the mid 80s, was forcibly committed to a psychiatric institution in Kano for eighteen days in 2014, where he was forcibly drugged. One doctor suggested there was nothing wrong with Bala but a second doctor suggested a personality disorder and, according to Bala, told him: > My dear, you need a God, even in Japan, they have a God, no one should live > without God, those that do, are all psychologically ill, denying the > biblical account of Adam and Eve is delusion, denial of history. The International Humanist and Ethical Union has taken up the case and feels Bala's Human rights were violated. According to the IHEU, \\"The real reason for this outrageous and inhumane action is because Mubarak has renounced Islam and has openly declared himself to be an atheist.\\" On 4 July 2014, the BBC reported that Bala had been released from hospital in conjunction with a doctors' strike, and was seeking reconciliation with his family. It was not yet clear if he would remain in Northern Nigeria, due to death threats. Mubarak Bala decided to stay in Nigeria and was named president of an organisation called the Nigerian Humanists. In April 2020, he was arrested in Kaduna for blasphemy due to a FaceBook post he made, and has been held without charge since then (as at 15 May 2020). Due to the fact that the Nigerian police allegedly transferred him from Kaduna to Kano, where Shariah law is practiced and in the face of several credible death threats fears are mounting for his safety. Leo Igwe has been working hard to fight for his rights, working with several atheist and humanist organisations, notably Humanism International and Atheist Alliance International, which has a long and honorable history of campaigning going back to its registration as a charity in 1991, and which has UN consultative status, Council of Europe participatory status and is Gold rated for transparency by Guide Star. Also, the newly formed International Association of Atheists (IAA) joined forces to raise awareness and funds to help pay Mubarak's legal costs, although it must be said that the international media has been mostly silent on this case. Recently, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) took an interest in Mubarak and have started applying pressure on the Nigerian government.

Early life and background  Evangelina Cosio was born on September 23, 1877, in Puerto Pr√≠ncipe, Cuba.PROFILES OF SIGNIFICANT FIGURES IN THE HISTORY OF CUBA (PART TWO), Raul Quintana Suarez, www.eumed.net She was the daughter of Augustin Cosio, who was an active participant in attempts to gain Cuban independence from Spain; Ms. Cosio's mother, Caridad de Cisneros y Litorre, died when Evangelina was a child.New York Times, August 25, 1897 In 1895, the Cuban Revolution/War of Independence started under leadership of Cuban writer Jos√© Julian Mart√≠ in an attempt to overthrow Spanish rule.Perils of Evangelina@, American Heritage, Volume 19, Issue 2, 1968 In the summer of 1896, Augustin Cosio, as one of the rebel leaders, was captured and sent to a penal colony on the Cuban Isle of Pines (now known as Isle of Youth). Evangelina Cosio accompanied him along with one of her sisters.Perils of Evangelina‚Äù, American Heritage, Volume 19, Issue 2, 1968 Initially the conditions on Isle of Pines were described by Ms. Cosio as relatively comfortable with Augustin living with his family in a small adobe house on the island. However, the arrival of a new governor, Colonel Jos√© Berriz, resulted in the imposition of imprisonment for the father.The Story of Evangelina Cisneros (Evangelina Betancourt Cosio Y Cisneros)Frederic Remington, K. Decker, Evangelina Cisneros, General Domain (1898) Evangelina appealed directly to the governor, but according to Ms. Cosio, he apparently mistook her pleas for something romantic. While there is much controversy as to the actual events, what is known is that the Colonel showed up at the young woman‚Äôs residence one night, and after making what she considered inappropriate advances, a commotion ensued. The Colonel was briefly taken prisoner by associates of Evangelina, and he was in turn rescued by some of his troops.The Story of Evangelina Cisneros (Evangelina Betancourt Cosio Y Cisneros)Frederic Remington, K. Decker, Evangelina Cisneros, General Domain (1898 In short order she was charged with attempted murder and rebellion. Evangelina subsequently denied any plot, and claimed she was solely attempting to protect herself from the Colonel‚Äôs advances, Cuban sources have suggested she was part of the rebel cause and the episode was indeed part of a larger attempt to free prisoners to join the revolutionary forces.Teresa Prados Torreira,\\"Desatando las alas,\\"La mujer cubana en la Guerra de Independencia‚Äù Santiago 1998 p 273 The full truth is not known. As a result of the incident, Evangelina Cosio was transferred from the Isle of Pines to a prison for women in Havana known as Casa de Recojidas, which had been given the reputation of being one of the most unpleasant jails in Cuba.George Clarke Musgrave, Under Three Flags in Cuba (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1899),  Imprisonment  Cosio remained in that jail for over a year awaiting trial. News reports indicated she would be sentenced to 20 years on an even more harsh penal colony off the coast of Spanish Morocco. At this point, in June 1897, American journalists became involved, in particular Hearst's papers and his reporters in Cuba.George Clarke Musgrave, Under Three Flags in Cuba (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1899) Hearst had been actively pushing for American assistance of the rebels in Cuba. When his reporters in Cuba discovered what they described as a young, cultured and attractive Evangelina Cosio in the women's jail, Hearst had a cause to use to attract more readers in his circulation battle with his rival in New York, Joseph Pulitzer's New York World. This came during the high point of the so-called ‚Äúyellow journalism‚Äù period when Hearst and Pulitzer were each attempting to outdo each other with ever more sensational news stories to attract the newly literate general public in New York. Commentators have suggested Hearst was determined to turn the affair into a damsel-in-distress story like that of the then popular medieval romances. Hearst first tried to obtain Cosio's release with a letter and petition campaign that managed to enlist 15,000 signatures, including the mother of President McKinley and the widow of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. The entreaties to the Spanish government, including the Queen Regent of Spain, were unsuccessful. Alleged attempts by Hearst reporters to bribe Cosio out of jail resulted in the Journal's primary reporter in Cuba being deported.  Escape  Hearst then decided to send another reporter to Cuba, Karl Decker, described as swashbuckling ‚Äúman of action,‚Äù who was given the task of breaking the young woman out of her jail cell. He went to Cuba, gathered some associates to assist in the effort, including Cuban sympathizers and Americans fluent in Spanish. He also had assistance of some members of the U.S. Consulate in Havana, who helped with at least the tacit approval of the American Consul-General, Fitzhugh Lee, a former Confederate General and the nephew of Robert E. Lee.‚ÄúNot a Hoax: New Evidence in the New York Journal‚Äôs Rescue of Evangelina Cisneros‚Äù W.Joseph Campbell American Journalism, 19, (4) Fall 2002 After Decker rejected a number of what appeared to be ill-advised schemes, including blowing a hole in the wall of the jail, Cosio devised a more realistic plan. The jail varied in height from two to three stories. Her third floor cell had a barred window that faced a flat area of jail‚Äôs roof. Cosio suggested drugging her jail-mates so they would sleep through the night and breaking out one of the bars to make her escape. Decker had a room rented in the building next door and at night had a ladder stretched from the roof of that building to the roof of the jail. He and his associates, over two nights, climbed over to the roof of the jail and sawed through one of the bars, which created a large enough opening for the slight prisoner to squeeze through and escape. The young woman was taken to the home of one of the conspirators, Carlos Carbonnel, an American educated, Cuban banker. After three days of hiding from the police-conducted searches, Cosio, dressed as man, with her abundant hair stuffed under a large hat, and carrying an unlit cigar, walked through Havana to the dock, boarded a New York bound ship using false identification papers, and escaped to the United States.  Response in America  Upon her arrival in New York, Hearst‚Äôs stage-craft and directions continued the focus on the young woman and the Hearst reporter who helped in her escape. This included receptions at Delmonico's and Madison Square Garden, and later a meeting with President McKinley in Washington D.C. She then commenced a fund raising campaign for Cuban independence, while Hearst continued to trumpet the escape as a prime example of ‚ÄúJournalism that Acts.‚Äù Rival newspapers suggested that a hoax, or at least bribery, was involved. The most recent research suggests these accusations were false. Ms. Cosio‚Äôs story faded with the rush of events, in particular the sinking of the American warship U.S.S. Maine and American‚Äôs declaration of war on Spain, which ultimately resulted in Cuba‚Äôs independence. However, commentators have said that the publicity around Cosio‚Äôs story, and similar newspaper agitation, probably helped to prepare the American public for the war when it did come, making it what has been called one of the most popular wars the United States ever fought.Fighting for American Manhood: How Gender Politics Provoked the Spanish ‚ÄìAmerican War and Philippine-American War By Kristin L. Hoganson, Yale University Press, 1998  Later life  Some months after her escape, Evangelina Cosio married one of her rescuers, Carlos Carbonnel, who was 28 years her senior.‚ÄúEvangelina Cos√≠o: una camag√ºeyana de mitos y realidades‚Äù Nace el sitio Web de la Oficina del Historiador de la Ciudad de Camaguey They had two daughters. Carbonnel died in 1916. In 1918, Evangelina remarried Miguel Romero, a Havana lawyer. Evangelina Cosio died May 29, 1970, and was given a full military funeral by the Cuban government, as one of the last heroes of the Cuban War of Independence.

Located just south of Flintholm station, on the border with Vanl√∏se, it is the result of a redevelopment of a former gasworks site which began in 2004 and is still ongoing. The neighborhood covers an area of about 10 hectares and consists of a mixture of housing, offices, retail and several minor green spaces. The only surviving building from the gasworks, The Yellow Villa, now serves as a local cultural centre. History Flintholm in about 1900 Flintholm takes its name from an estate which was founded when a large area of farm land which had until then belonged to Ladeg√•rden, a farm under Copenhagen Castle, was auctioned off in lots in 1765. It was named after Jacob Nielsen Flindt, a farmer, who acquired the property in the 1790s. In 1827, most of the land was sold off to a neighbouring estate, Gr√∏ndal, while the house, including a small wood and a garden, was sold to H. J. Grove, a post officer, who used it as a summer retreat.< The area remained open countryside until the 1890s when it was acquired by the City and designated for municipal utility and service functions. Frederiksberg's second gasworks opened at 76 Finsensvej in 1895 and was in 1908 joined by Finsen Power Station down the road. Flintholm House was adapted for use as an infectious decease hospital. It consisted of 12 beds in the house and 40 beds in two tent wings. It was in use in 1917, when Frederiksberg was hit by an outbreak of scarlet fever, and again a few years later during an outbreak of smallpox. Up through the century, Frederiksberg Gasworks saw several expansions, especially in the years after World War II, before it was closed down in 1964. Redevelopment In 2001, prompted by the opening of Flintholm station, Frederiksberg Municipality, in collaboration with DSB and private investors, decided to develop a masterplan for redevelopment of the area into a new mixed-use neighbourhood. The new streets and spaces that were created were mostly named for Danish revue artists, such as Preben Kaas, Dirch Passer, Elga Olga, Kjeld Petersen, Marguerite Viby and Stig Lommer. The area is therefore also known as Revykvarteret, literally \\"The Revue Quarter\\". Notable buildings and residents Flintholm station The only surviving building from the gasworks is a building known as the Yellow House (Den Gule Villa). It is now used as a local cultural centre. It was listed in 2003. Flintholm Church is not located within the area but further south at Peter Bangs Vej. NCC's Flintholm Company House was designed by Vilhelm Lauritzen Architects and is located next to Flintholm Station. It contains 21,000 square metres of office space and 3m000 square metres for retail and caf√©s. KPMG inaugurated their new Danish head office in the area in 2011. Their building was designed by 3XN and has room for 1,700 employees.

It was first aired by Telefe with the name \\"El √∫ltimo pasajero\\" (Spanish: The Last Passenger), from 2005 to 2009, and from 2011 by El Trece, first with the name \\"Baril√≥, a todo o nada\\" and the current name. The show's format included participants of all ages, from children to the elderly, who played a wide range of games for numerous high- quality prizes. The show is no longer being produced; however some Latin American countries still broadcast reruns.  Original Show  Formerly 2 divisions of seniors from different high schools competed with each other to win a trip to the city of San Carlos de Bariloche, with a format similar to that of the show \\"Feliz domingo\\" (Happy Sunday in English). The schools were represented by red and blue teams. Originally, during the season El √∫ltimo pasajero, there was three teams. (Red, green, and blue, mirroring the likeness of the logo for the television channel Telefe.) However, in 2008, the team was eliminated. The objective of the game was to add more team members on their trip bus. But they had to pass tests, win challenges, ask questions, take embarrassing clothing, and endure physical pain, such as cutting hair with fire, (by a specialist), among other challenges. When a team managed to get all the passengers in the bus, (or at least one,) the last person outside, who was called the last passenger, was given charge of choosing two keys. Then a driver in the bus who had a microphone said if the key chosen was the right one to get the bus started. The first team to get the right key, and to get their bus started, was the one able to go on the trip. The program has had differing versions in different Latin American countries; in the Argentina version the buses are of the Tecnoporte brand, and was provided by the Ivecam company representative for Argentina. In the summer of 2012, A Todo o Nada was allowed two hours and thirty minutes of screentime, but because of low ratings, was on the verge of being cancelled. Because of this, the producer changed the formatting of the program. Initially, the yellow and green teams were incorporated together, as well as the red and blue. The passengers also had to be evaluated by a jury when they completed challenges. However, that format didn't work either, so it was decided to make games that appealed to a wider audience, to win many different prizes, for example, \\"throw the glass on the LCD\\" and \\"Embark on a challenge for a trip worth 200,000 pesos\\", among others. Also, there was a new section where a participant led an argument about a product with the driver. As of 2013, the program has an average rating of 9.0, placing it in the top 10 of the most watched television programs daily.  End of Show  On November 28, 2014, the program aired its final episode. This was due to the premiere of a new show, which meant the return of Julian Weich to the screen, with the program \\"Mi mam√° cocina mejor que la tuya\\" (Spanish: \\"My mother cooks better than yours\\"), as well as \\"El Mejor de la Cocina\\" (Spanish: \\"The Best of the Kitchen\\"). Both of these shows took up the television block that A todo a nada previously occupied. This block was from 6:45 PM to 8:00 PM on Fridays and Mondays. However, the program continued to be broadcast on Fridays at 9:15 pm with the name of \\"All or nothing: special Friday\\" until December 19, 2014.

Winfield Scott. This fort was on the Fort Leavenworth- Fort Gibson Military Road. The completed fort was fairly elaborate. It included space to house a company of dragoons and their horses. Also, it contained a hospital and store houses. Gaps along the outside walls of buildings were filled in with stockade walls. The buildings were built around a large interior open area.\\"Trading Post Is One of Oldest Settlements in the Entire State,\\" Fort Scott Tribune and the Fort Scott Monitor, May 30, 1942, anniversary ed., historical sec., p. 8. In spite of the considerable work going into the fort's construction, it was used for only a short time, possibly only weeks. The troops there abandoned the fort and moved further south to build Fort Scott. Private individuals made use of the fort and troops did not use it until 1861, when the American Civil War erupted.William A. Mitchell, Linn County, Kansas: A history (Kansas City: Campbell-Gates and Charno Bindery, 1928), pp. 116, 197-8. The first time the use of Trading Post's fort was mentioned during the Civil War was when troops were stationed there in September 1861, although it appears they soon left. Between early 1862 and June 1864 Trading Post was almost continuously occupied by troops. In 1862 Col. Charles R. Jennison led troops stationed there, but the settlers complained about their unruliness. Jennison's men were then removed.Mitchell, pp. 116, 197-8. In October 1864 the troops at Trading Post were removed and sent to Missouri to meet Confederate forces under Maj. Gen. Sterling Price. After Price was defeated October 23 in the Battle of Westport, his forces moved south along the Kansas-Missouri border. The next day some of his men occupied Trading Post and two imposing hills north of town. Price himself was with them. Union forces arrived in the evening and at 3 AM October 25 the Battle of Marais des Cygnes began. The Union forces dislodged the Confederates from the hills and then about daylight charged into Trading Post, capturing 100 Confederates. All Confederate forces retreated south and later that day the Battle of Mine Creek forced the Confederates to continue their southward march toward Arkansas.Maj. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis, report, The War of the Rebellion (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1891), Series I, Vol. XLI, Part I, pp. 493-5.Mitchell, p. 116.Lumir F. Buresh, October 25th and the Battle of Mine Creek (Kansas City: Lowell Press, 1977), pp. 85-6. Soon after Price left the area troops were sent to garrison Trading Post again. A stable and some living quarters were built in February 1865. Troops remained until at least early June 1865. After troops left for good, the old fort was occupied for a time by two families. Later it was demolished, as a road was built through the fort.Untitled story, The Border Sentinel (Mound City, Kans.), February 3, 1865, p. 3.Lieut. Col. D. J.

The Newark Museum Explorers Program is a year-round work-based, college-preparatory, and mentoring program that supports Newark high school students in their exploration of the sciences and humanities, and pursuit of a college education. The program is run from the Newark Museum in Newark, New Jersey, United States. History In 1995, the Science Explorer's Program was the recipient of a start-up grant under the YouthAlive! Project, a national initiative, funded by the DeWitt Wallace Readers Digest Fund in partnership with the Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC). The initiative called for the development of programs in museums that could provide positive work and learning opportunities for young people. The Newark Museum, in keeping with its long history of actively addressing the needs of its community, designed such a program. Through the years, the Explorers‚Äô program has evolved into a successful college and job preparedness program that provides invaluable education, employment, and mentoring opportunities to urban youth. The Newark Museum Explorers Program is also a recipient of a grant provided by the Rivendell Foundation. Meetings and workshops Explorers meet regularly for workshops, meetings and training sessions prior to each festival. Workshops offered in the past includes public speaking workshops, financial literacy workshops, glass art workshops, etiquette workshops, animation workshops, mural painting, soap and candle making workshops. Meetings, workshops scheduled by program coordinator and field trips supersedes internship duties. If a meeting, field trip or workshop conflicts with Explorer's internship schedule, it is the Explorer's responsibility to inform their supervisor of the existing conflict in schedule. Explorers are expected to participate in all meetings, workshops and field trips throughout their participation in the program. Attendance and participation in these events are vital parts of each student's experience and their continuation to participate in the Program. Internships To equip students with employable skills, students will have the opportunity to work in different departments at the Newark Museum and other partnering organizations during their internships as well as varying museum activities, events and festivals. Explorers are assigned mentors who supervise them through the acquisition of employable skills in different departments, events and festivals such as: *weekend family arts and science activities, Science Department, Dynamic Earth, Membership, Exhibits, Special Events, Junior Museum, Planetarium, Visitor Services, Museum Library, School Programs, and Museum Shop. Explorers work for about 4 hours per week during the school year, and about 20 hours per week during the summer. Students have the opportunity to work in different departments as well as varying museum activities, festivals and events in order to gain employable skills. The Explorers Program is a job preparedness program. Therefore, students are not compensated for participation in workshops, trainings and field trips. Field trips Explorers are engaged in outdoor education through several field trips. In the past, Explorers have taken trips to The Bronx Zoo, New York Aquarium, CSI: The Experience, Bodies Exhibit, Mural Tour of Philadelphia, Metropolitan Museum of Arts, World Series of Birding, Osprey Banding in Maryland, American Museum of Natural History and the Wax Museum. Explorers have also visited colleges such as Yale, Columbia University, Montclair University, Pennsylvania State University, New York University and The College of New Jersey. At the end of each year, graduating classes attend a 3-day senior trip. In the past, the graduating Explorers have visited Puerto Rico, 1000 Acres Ranch Resort New York, Baltimore, Maryland, and Montreal, Canada. Alumni Since its inception in 1994, the Explorers Program has maintained a 90% retention rate. The Explorers Program gives students a stronger leadership background and opens up doors that these students never thought they could walk through. Students leave the program with new found courage, leadership, and skills they might never have attained without the help of this program. During the course of the year, each student attends an average of 80 meetings, a minimum of 10 additional training sessions and log in about 320 internship hours. The students‚Äô participation and retention in the program indicates that they are enjoying the program. The Explorers program maintained a 95% retention rate in 2012‚Äì13. The program has maintained a 100% high school graduation and college attendance for five years from 2008. 225 students have graduated from the Explorers program since its conception in 1995, and have been attending an institution of higher education within 12 months of their high school graduation. The alumni component is vital to track long-term success of the program. This component will include annual luncheons open to all alumni. This luncheon aims to be aware of the Alumnus progress and create a mentoring opportunity for the program. This component will also host an alumni reunion every 2‚Äì3 years. The Explorers Peer Mentor will oversee Explorers Alumni affairs. Some alumni attend leading institutions of higher learning such as Harvard Law School, Princeton University, Columbia University, and Cornell University, where they studied: *nursing, engineering, medicine, chemistry, mathematics, education, architecture, microbiology, cell biology, Biochemistry, Graphic design, International Relations, Sociology, Biology and nutrition , business, and computer graphics, just to mention a few.

They frequently co-produce songs together and put the finishing touches on the projects released by Top Dawg Entertainment.  History  All four members of the group, Tae Beast, Willie B, Sounwave and Dave Free, grew up in the Los Angeles, California area. They all started out as solo producers before working with Black Hippy members Kendrick Lamar, Jay Rock, ScHoolboy Q and Ab- Soul. Top Dawg Entertainment began signing all four producers to deals to become in-house producers for the record label. Shortly after all signing, Sounwave and Dave Free were in the studio, when Dave Free said, \\"We should get all our producers together and make this one Voltron of production.\\" He felt they all had different great qualities about their productions that would fit well together. In November 2012, Complex named the group one of the \\"Top 25 New Producers to Watch Out For\\". In July 2013, BET named Digi+Phonics as a group, as one of the top ten young producers on the rise. Members of the group also worked on ScHoolboy Q's major label debut album Oxymoron.  Members  = Tae Beast = Donte Perkins, better known by his stage name Tae Beast is an American record producer from Los Angeles, California. Beast is also one- half of the production team The Weirrd People, alongside Skhye Hutch. Tae Beast first got into producing records when his cousin and his cousin's friend showed him how to use an MP60 keyboard, and he would take his dad's old records and chop up samples along with playing the keyboard. Beast began his love for music in the '80s listening to old vinyl Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield records with his father, and continued in the 90's as he tried to loop tracks to make instrumentals on a karaoke machine. His love for the likes of J Dilla, RZA and Kanye West, just to name a few have begun to shape his sound as a soulful hip hop producer. Early in his career he had already worked with the likes of U-N-I, Jay Rock and Bad Lucc. Tae Beast originally got linked up with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) after playing a few beats for Black Hippy's Ab-Soul, in 2010, one of which became \\"Turn Me Up\\". Soon after he had a meeting with TDE, it resulted in him signing with the record label as a producer. On July 15, 2010, Tae Beast released his first project, an instrumental mixtape titled The Tae Beast Tape. On October 1, 2012 he released the sequel to his first mixtape, aptly titled The Tae Beast Tape 2. In early 2014, he earned placement on ScHoolboy Q's album Oxymoron by producing \\"Grooveline Pt. 2\\" and produced the Logic and Big Sean song \\"Alright\\".

From there, he graduated to a 4-track machine and then to the MTV Music Generator for PlayStation. After using that for a while he hooked up with rapper Bishop Lamont from Carson, California, and a song he produced for him with MTV Music Generator received local radio placement. In 2005, Sounwave was originally discovered by Top Dawg Entertainment co-founder Terrence \\"Punch\\" Henderson, who had him meet with TDE CEO, Anthony \\"Top Dawg\\" Tiffith. Anthony \\"Top Dawg\\" Tiffith was originally unimpressed with Sounwave, however, he persisted and honed his craft which ended up \\"blowing away\\" Tiffith. Sounwave's earliest work for Top Dawg Entertainment surfaced on the self- titled Kendrick Lamar EP, and Jay Rock's compilation track \\"Fa Sho\\" in 2009 and 2010 respectively. In 2011, Sounwave produced a bulk of Kendrick Lamar's mixtape/album Section.80, which landed him on Complexs \\"15 New Producers to Watch\\" list. He also produced three songs on Lamar's critically acclaimed second album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012).

The first Republican to serve on the 319th court, Greenwell was first elected in 2002 and reelected in 2006 and 2010. Legal career In 1981, Greenwell graduated from the University of Texas School of Law. In 1978, he received his Bachelor of Arts with concentration in political science and journalism from George Washington University in Washington, D.C.. In 1981, he was appointed a staff attorney on the Texas 13th Court of Appeals. He was chief of the legal staff on that court from 1991 to 1996. From 1997 until 2002, he was in private practice. For two years Greenwell served as the presiding administrative district judge of Nueces County. He also presided over the newly established Nueces County Veterans Court, which uses a collaborative approach among the courts, probation and corrections, and law enforcement agencies. It assists with cases of substance abuse, post traumatic stress, and anger. Greenwell ran unsuccessfully in the general election held on November 6, 2012, for the position of judge of the Texas 13th District Court of Appeals for a term that would have expired in 2018. He was defeated by the Democrat Nora Longoria, 262,235 (59.5 percent) to 178,554 (40.5 percent). He had planned to seek another term on the state district court in the Republican primary scheduled for March 4, 2014.

Suicide and aftermath Greenwell was found in his chambers dead from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head. A handwritten will was found near the body. According to Nueces County Sheriff Jim Kaelin, the judge faced financial ruin. He had exhausted spending caps on five credit cards and owed the repayment of loans. Kaelin said that Greenwell earned at least $140,000 annually but did not apparently live extravagantly. Investigators are looking into possible blackmail or extortion attempts against the judge. A memorial service was to be held on July 25, 2013 at the First United Methodist Church in Corpus Christi. Greenwell had a surviving brother. He left his estate to Albert Fuentes (born c. 1977), one of the persons of interest in Greenwell's death. Fuentes has in the past had scrapes with the law, and Greenwell had been trying to help him for at least six years. Fuentes moved rent-free into a house that the judge owned in Sun Valley Estates and was allowed to drive Greenwell's vehicle.

She served primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as a convoy escort. She was named for Prescott, Ontario. Background Flower-class corvettes like Prescott serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French for classes of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Prescott was ordered on 7 February 1940 as part of the 1939‚Äì1940 Flower-class program. She was laid down by Kingston Shipbuilding Co. at Kingston, Ontario on 31 August 1940 and launched 7 January 1941. She was commissioned at Montreal, Quebec on 26 June 1941. During her career she had four significant refits. The first took place in early 1942 after developing mechanical problems. She required two months repairs at Liverpool, Nova Scotia to fix them. The second refit took place in the United Kingdom after she was assigned to Operation Torch. There she received additional AA armament. After completing her Torch duties, she returned to Canada in April 1943 and late in that month she began a six-month refit at Liverpool. During this refit she had her fo'c'sle extended. Prescotts final refit began in September 1944 at Liverpool. Service history After working up Prescott joined the Newfoundland Escort Force (NEF) on 31 August 1941. She remained with that force until early 1942 when she was sent back to port with mechanical problems. She returned to service on 21 April 1942 and stayed with the NEF until being transferred to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) in July. After a short period with the WLEF she was assigned to operations in connection with Operation Torch. On 13 March 1943 during convoy escort off Cape Finisterre, Prescott encountered and sank the U-boat . She returned from her Torch duties to Atlantic convoy service on 4 April 1943. She departed for a major refit later that month. After returning from a six-month refit she was worked up at Pictou and sent to join Escort Group 6 under Royal Navy command. She served with the group until April 1944 when the corvettes were replaced with frigates. Prescott then joined the Western Approaches Command as part of Operation Neptune. After the invasion she returned to Liverpool for another refit. After working up she served with Nore Command until the end of the war. Prescott was paid off on 20 July 1945 at Sorel, Quebec. She was sold for scrap on 30 August 1946 and broken up in 1951 at Hamilton, Ontario.Miramar Ship Index has the ship broken up in Montreal, Quebec.

Johnny Meadows is seriously wounded in battle in the South Pacific during World War Two. While recuperating, he takes comfort reading a book donated to the Red Cross by Rosemary Blake, who has written her name and address in the book. He corresponds with her, and as pen pals they fall in love. Eventually, on leave and back in the States, he heads for Rosemary‚Äôs home. While taking the train to get there, he meets a pretty woman reading the same book, and for a moment thinks he has met Rosemary. But the lovely woman is Dr. Leslie Ross, coincidentally heading for the same town where Rosemary lives, to take over a practice being left by another doctor. They start a friendly conversation, but then there is a derailment of several cars ahead of them, and the doctor treats those who are wounded, while Johnny assists where he can. More help arrives and, both exhausted, they share a cab-ride into the town they were both headed for. The next day, as the doctor settles into running her practice, Johnny heads up the high hill to the house where Rosemary lives. He meets the homeowner, an older disabled woman, Mrs. Blake (Rosemary‚Äôs mother), and her live-in assistant, Ivy Miller. Mrs. Blake and Miller tell Johnny that Rosemary is away, but will be back soon, and Mrs. Blake invites him to stay. The next day Mrs. Blake shows Johnny a large painting done of Rosemary, so he can see how beautiful she is. Johnny is happy, and, from the style in which the painting is done, thinks he knows the artist, but can‚Äôt fully recall whom at the moment. After a few days of Rosemary not showing up, and no satisfactory answers forthcoming from either Mrs. Blake or Miller, who seems very nervous about the situation, Johnny leaves for San Francisco. He finally remembered who the artist was, as he had worked with him for a short time in the City before the war. Meanwhile, Miller attempts to divulge to Dr. Ross just what is going on, but her nervousness and insecurities stop her. Dr. Ross and her nurse suspect something strange is going on in the Blake house, but because Mrs. Blake had been dismissive of the doctor during an initial consult on her first day in town, they take no specific action. That evening. when Mrs. Blake discovers what Miller tried to do, she gives Miller an overdose of medicine to kill her. A few moments later, Dr. Ross shows up at the home to see how Miller is doing, and then Johnny shows up too. He has found out the painting is a ‚Äòfantasy‚Äô of what Mrs. Blake pictured as a perfect daughter. Johnny goes upstairs to find Miller for an explanation, but finds her body, and Dr. Ross can do nothing to revive her. Mrs. Blake accuses the doctor of committing malpractice, but the doctor tells her the medicine she had prescribed for Miller wasn‚Äôt sufficient to kill her. Finally, Mrs. Blake confesses she always wanted a daughter, and always wanted to be loved and wanted, and that she had corresponded with Johnny. Johnny tells Mrs. Blake he loves the doctor now. Then Dr. Ross suggests Miller was murdered, but Mrs. Blake says it was suicide, that Miller has left a note. Johnny and the doctor ask to see it, and Mrs. Blake leaves them to fetch it. She instead goes out to their car to set a booby-trap. She returns without the note, and sends them away. They leave, and Johnny is almost killed after stepping through the trap Mrs. Blake had set. Dr. Ross realizes what has happened, and they feign their deaths by screaming aloud. Hearing this, Mrs. Blake telephones for an ambulance, but then Johnny and the doctor walk into the room, and the game is up. Cast * William Terry as Sgt.

The battle between the besiegers, a group of rebels led by Li Heng and the Song Chinese defenders is important in global history as the first recorded instance of the fire lance, an early ancestor of firearms, being used in battle. Background After the Jingkang crisis, the Song capital Kaifeng fell to the Jurchens. In 1130, the Jurchens established a puppet state called Great Qi to govern the newly acquired land. Liu Yu, a former Song governor of Jinan who capitulated to the Jurchens, was appointed as Great Qi‚Äôs emperor. Liu Yu‚Äôs regime was unpopular to the people, which led to several rebellions. One of the rebel leaders, Sang Chong (Ê°ëÂÜ≤), pledged allegiance to the Southern Song emperor. However, Huo Ming, a Song general, suspecting Sang Chong to be a Jurchen spy, ordered to kill him. Li Heng, Sang Chong‚Äôs subordinate, then led the rebel forces against the Southern Song. The battle A fire lance as depicted in the Huolongjing. A fire ox from the Huolongjing Rebel forces led by Li Heng (ÊùéÊ©´) encircled the city of De'an (; modern Anlu in eastern Hubei) with a force of 10,000, established around 70 stockades, and set up watch towers to observe enemy movements within the city and relay their positions by fire at night and bright flags by day. Carpenters, smiths, and leatherworkers from nearby areas were forced to construct mobile assault towers called \\"sky bridges\\" that could be wheeled to the walls for soldiers to make a frontal assault on the ramparts. In response, the prefect of De'an, Chen Gui (Èô≥Ë¶è) ordered the garrisons to construct defensive structures atop the walls to hide their movements and protect against enemy arrows and trebuchet projectiles. These were constantly damaged by enemy fire, but were repaired in kind. After defensive structures had been completed, trebuchets were deployed to return fire against Jin siege weapons, damaging them to great effect. The protracted siege forced Jin troops to scour the countryside for food while De'an's moat prevented a direct attack on the city itself. Eventually rebels resorted to using children, women, and the elderly to gather material, including their own bodies, to fill the moat, but this was ultimately unsuccessful as Chen retaliated by firing gunpowder arrows into the moat, burning the wood and straw filling. Siege forces tried again, this time with mud and brick caked filling, and once they deemed the moat sufficiently filled, started their assault. Sky bridges rolled up to the walls under cover of archers and trebuchet fire, but Chen's defenders used long beams to keep them from getting any closer than ten feet from the walls. While soldiers were stuck on their assault platforms, De'an defenders unleashed the fire lances: \\"Using fire-bomb potion (ÁÅ´Á†≤Ëó•), long bamboo lances were made ready. More than twenty of them, as well as good numbers of striking spears and hook-blade staves (Èâ§ÈêÆ), all of which would be deployed, with two people holding one together, and which were made in such a way that when the sky bridges approached the wall, [the defenders could] emerge from above and below their defense structures and deploy them.\\" Fire lancers used their weapons to attack the sky bridge porters: \\"As the sky bridges became stuck fast, more than ten feet from the walls and unable to get any closer, [the defenders] were ready. From below and above the defensive structures they emerged and attacked with fire lances, striking lances, and hooked sickles, each in turn. The people [i.e., the porters] at the base of the sky bridges were repulsed. Pulling their bamboo ropes, they [the porters] ended up drawing the sky bridge back in an anxious and urgent rush, going about fifty paces before stopping.\\" During the siege, Chen was wounded in the foot by a trebuchet and supplies became scarce in the city. Chen maintained troop morale by using his personal funds to supply the troops. Seventy days into the siege, Li Heng sent a messenger into the city indicating that he would lift the siege if Chen would send him a maiden. Chen, realizing that the Jin forces were also in a dire situation by proposing such an odd offer, refused despite the entreaties of his commanders. Seizing the critical moment, Chen released a drove of oxen enraged by setting fire to their tails, and personally led a group of 60 fire lancers out from the west gate to make a direct attack on the sky bridge soldiers. Defenders on the walls threw bricks and shot arrows in conjunction with trebuchets hurling bombs and rocks. The sky bridges were burned with incendiary bundles of grass and firewood and their destruction caused the complete collapse of rebel morale. The commander Li Heng decided to lift the siege and retreat with severe casualties. Legacy The siege of De'an marks an important transition and landmark in the history of gunpowder weapons as the ‚Äúfire potion‚Äù (ÁÅ´Ëó•, which has passed down as the Chinese word for gunpowder) of the fire lances were described using a new word: \\"fire bomb potion\\" (ÁÅ´ÁÇÆËó•), rather than simply \\"fire potion\\". This could imply the use of a new more potent formula, or simply an acknowledgement of the specialized military application of gunpowder. Peter Lorge suggests that this \\"bomb powder\\" may have been corned, making it distinct from normal gunpowder. Evidence of gunpowder firecrackers also points to their appearance at roughly around the same time fire potion was making its transition in the literary imagination. Fire lances continued to be used as anti-personnel weapons into the 12th century, and were even attached to battle carts in one situation in 1163. Song commander Wei Sheng constructed several hundred of these carts known as \\"at-your-desire-war-carts\\" (Â¶ÇÊÑèÊà∞Ëªä), which contained fire lances protruding from protective covering on the sides. They were used to defend mobile trebuchets that hurled fire bombs.

The large, stone church was built in a long church design and in the Art Nouveau style in 1909 by the architect Sverre Knudsen. The church seats about 800 people. History The first church in √Ölesund was constructed in 1855, shortly after it was designated as a kj√∏pstad in 1848. The new stone church was designed by the architect Heinrich Ernst Schirmer. The church's design was very similar to the Str√∏m Church in S√∏r-Odal municipality in Hedmark county. On 23 January 1904, the church was destroyed by the great √Ölesund fire. Hundreds of buildings were destroyed and nearly the entire town had to be rebuilt. After a competition of architects, Sverre Knudsen was chosen as the person to design the new √Ölesund Church. The foundation stone for the new church was laid down on 13 July 1906 by the new King Haakon VII. Roughly of marble cover the church's fa√ßade. The church took about three years to be completed and it was consecrated on 15 September 1909.

It is located in the village of Borgund, just east of the city of √Ölesund. It is the church for the Borgund parish which is part of the Nordre Sunnm√∏re prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of M√∏re. The historic, white, stone church was built in a cruciform style around the year 1300 by an unknown architect. The church reflects both Romanesque and Gothic architectural styles. The church seats about 750 people. History The earliest existing historical records of a church in Borgund date back to the 12th century. In fact, at one point, there may have been as many as four stone churches in Borgund. Records talk about the (St. Margaret's Church), (Christ Church), (St. Matthew's Church), and (St. Peter's Church). It is believed that the St. Peter's Church was located on the site of the present- day Borgund Church, in fact some of the stone walls are believed to the original walls. During the centuries, the church was renovated. Records show that in 1632 and again in 1864 the church was expanded and turned into a cruciform design. The altarpiece and pulpit were decorated in the baroque style during the 1600s as well. The church was the seat of the large Borgund prestegjeld and later the main church for the large Borgund Municipality. The church had a major fire and the building was almost completely destroyed on 13 April 1904 by an arsonist only described as \\"mentally disturbed\\" by the local police. The loss was tragic, but a new church was rapidly built within the remaining medieval walls using plans by the architects Christian Siegwart and Hans Siegwart. The church was consecrated on 7 August 1907. The pulpit and altar were carved from oak by local craftsmen. Additional wooden features were later added by artist Oddvin Parr. The church organ dates from 1981 to was built by Marcussen & S√∏n of Aabenraa, Denmark.

It and its sister species, the hero shrew (Scutisorex somereni), are the only mammal species known to have interlocking vertebrae. Description Thor's hero shrew has a smaller skull and fewer lower vertebrae‚Äîeight instead of ten or eleven‚Äîthan its sister species. The vertebrae have fewer bony offshoots, and the animal's ribs are flatter and more robust. Like the hero shrew, it has an extremely strong back‚Äîroughly four times stronger than a human's, adjusted for size. It is less than long and weighs approximately . Hero shrews are generally less flexible than most mammals, but are able to turn around in confined spaces by sagittally flexing their spines. Discovery Thor's hero shrew was first described in Biology Letters by a team headed by vertebrate biologist William Stanley. In July 2013. It was discovered when Stanley dissected a specimen of hero shrew collected in the village of Baleko and found that its spine was different from those of known specimens. The team named the shrew after Thorvald \\"Thor\\" Holmes, Jr of the Humboldt State University Vertebrate Museum, as well as referring to the Norse god Thor due to the god's association with strength. Evolutionary significance The structure of Thor's hero shrew's cranium and vertebrae suggest that it may be descended from an evolutionary intermediate between the hero shrew and other shrews. Its existence may help explain the evolution of the hero shrew which, Stanley explains, has historically been cited as an excellent example of punctuated equilibrium, a theory that holds that species sometimes evolve very rapidly in short periods of time after long periods of stability. The existence of an intermediate species hints at a more gradual or incremental evolution for the hero shrew's extreme specialization. Thor's hero shrew may also help explain the evolutionary advantage of interlocking vertebrae. The animal's discoverers hypothesize that both hero shrew species use their strong backs to push under logs or rocks to find worms or to crawl into the tight spaces between the trunk and the bases of palm leaves to find larvae. The proposed behavior has not been observed in the wild, but the shrews are commonly seen in palm forests, where they have runways around the tree trunks.

The film stars Annette Bening, Ed Harris, Robin Williams, Amy Brenneman, Jess Weixler and Linda Park. It was screened in the Special Presentation section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot Nikki (Bening) is a recent widow whose husband, Garret (Ed Harris), died in a drowning accident; Nikki has not yet gotten over it. Objects, people and situations that remind Nikki of the love of her life still haunt her. Resigned to life alone, Nikki visits an art gallery she often frequented with Garret and sees a man (Harris in a dual role) whose resemblance to her husband stuns her. She returns to the gallery several more times, hoping to see him. Eventually, Nikki identifies him as a professor at a small local college. She finds \\"Tom\\" on the internet and visits an art class he is teaching; but she is emotionally overwhelmed and flees. Eventually, Nikki calms down and invites Tom to give her private, at home, tutoring in painting. She doesn't disclose to him his physical resemblance to her late husband. Nikki and Tom become lovers, to the emotional distress of her neighbor (Robin Williams), who has hoped to attract her interest romantically since the death of Garret, his friend. The strain of keeping Tom a secret from her friends and family, who would immediately recognize the uncanny resemblance, begins to wear on Nikki, Tom, and the relationship. Nikki is not alone in keeping secrets in the relationship. Tom, who is divorced for 10 years from his ex-wife yet still maintains a close friendship with her, does not tell Nikki he suffers from a severe heart ailment. When Nikki‚Äôs adult daughter Summer visits unexpectedly, finding Tom at the house, she flies into a rage repulsed by Tom‚Äôs appearance. Tom believes her outrage is triggered simply by his presence. Tom, puzzled by the daughter's reaction, accepts when Nikki asks him to fly off to Mexico with her. At a resort often visited by Garret and Nikki when they were married, Tom discovers a photo of Nikki and her husband by the bar, notices the resemblance and also realizes that a psychologically imbalanced Nikki has brought him to the very place her husband died. Tom confronts her with the resemblance and Nikki runs off into the raging surf, perhaps to commit suicide. She is rescued by Tom and they later hold one another in bed with the knowledge the relationship isn't based on anything more than his physical similarity to Garret and is doomed. A year later, Summer finds an art gallery card in Nikki's mail that turns out to be an invitation to a memorial display of Tom's art. Tom has died of his heart condition but produced an outpouring of art in his last year. Nikki attends the reception hosted by Tom's ex-wife and tearfully sees Tom's painting of the two of them titled \\"The Face of Love\\". He has painted a haunting self portrait of himself with Nikki standing in her pool at her home looking at him.

Mata (November 7, 1915 ‚Äì March 7, 2012) was a Filipino General and the 15th Secretary of National Defense of the Republic of the Philippines, serving in that capacity from 21 January 1967 to 3 February 1970. Mata was also a former Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff, the only retired officer to be recalled to active duty to occupy this position. In February 2012, just before his death, he was acknowledged to be the only known living graduate of the Philippine Constabulary Academy, which was later renamed the Philippine Military Academy in 1935. Biography =Early life= Mata was born on 7 November 1915 in Laoag, Ilocos Norte. In 1933 he graduated from Ilocos Norte High School and took further education at the University of the Philippines Junior College at Vigan, Ilocos Sur. He passed the Philippine Constabulary Academy entrance exam a year later, graduating in March 1937. That same year, he became a Third Lieutenant and was assigned with the 23rd Philippine Constabulary Company in Iloilo City. =World War II= During World War II he fought in the United States Army Forces in the Far East and was a commanding officer for the 3rd Battalion, 74th Regiment, and 71st Division in Negros. From 1942 to 1945, instead of surrendering to the Imperial Japanese Army, he led the 72nd Division of the 7th Military District on the island of Negros and assisted in the liberation of the Philippines from the Japanese invaders. He served as aide-de-camp for President Sergio Osme√±a. He later completed the Infantry Officer's Advanced Course at Fort Benning, Georgia and the Command and General Staff College course at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. =Post War era= When World War II ended, Mata began studying at the Institute of Foreign Affairs at the Department of Foreign Affairs. He attended the Harvard Advance Management Programs in Baguio in 1958. On June 16 of that year, he became Military Assistant to Jesus Vargas who then was Defense Secretary. Two years later, he took a course in Modern Weapon Familiarization at Fort Bliss, Texas and the same year made tours of various armies of Greece, Italy, and Spain. =1960-1970= In March 1962, he became commander of the 1st Infantry Division of the Philippine Army and on 24 June 1963, became their commanding general. He was promoted during President Diosdado Macapagal's term to Brigadier General a month later. He retired on June 1964 but was recalled back to duty on 22 January 1966 by President Ferdinand Marcos and was appointed as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. He also became Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Military advisor and when he finally retired from the military on 21 January 1967, he was appointed as Secretary of National Defense. He served without receiving a salary, relying only on his pension as a retired general. He was able to collect his accumulated salary as Defense Secretary in September 1972, more than two years after he relinquished the post.

On 17 February 1825, Almorah returned to Sydney from Batavia. Captain Mitchell, of , which was serving as a guardship at Port Jackson, seized Almorah for having on board 300 chests of tea. He was urged on by Sydney merchants who did not like Government imports. Probably more importantly, Mitchell would have been entitled to a quarter of the value of the vessel and her cargo if the court upheld his seizure. There was no Court of Admiralty at Sydney, so over Governor Brisbane's objections, Mitchell put a crew aboard Almorah that sailed her on 2 March to Calcutta for adjudication.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ6048. There seized Almorah and her cargo. The charge was that the tea violated the EIC's monopoly on the private trade in tea. Litigation lasted five years without any definitive result. One problem was that Brisbane had not specifically mentioned tea in his instructions. Had he done so, there would have been no issue as the EIC monopoly did not apply to government purchases. Eventually the British Government persuaded all concerned to give up their claims. It also paid Almorahs owners ¬£5000 for their freight and losses.

E. \\"Nick\\" Nichols, was an American jurist in Georgia who served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia from 1975 to 1980. Personal life Nichols was born in Elkmont, Alabama to Mr. and Mrs. William Henry Nichols. He attended public school in Birmingham. His early training in piano and voice resulted in a lifelong love of music. He married Edith Mae Bowers in October 1945. They had two daughters and a son. Mrs. Nichols died in May 1984. Education He received his Bachelor of Law degree from the Cumberland School of Law while it was part of Cumberland University at Lebanon, Tennessee. He later studied constitutional law at Columbia University. He was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and Blue Key Honor Society. Career He was admitted to the State Bar of Georgia in December 1935 and began practicing law in Canton, Georgia. In 1938, he became Assistant Solicitor of the Blue Ridge Circuit in Georgia where he served until 1940 when he moved to Rome, Georgia. After practicing law for six years in Rome, he was appointed Assistant Attorney General of Georgia, serving two years. On October 18, 1948, he was appointed Judge of the Superior Court for the Rome Circuit. At the expiration of the appointment, he was elected to a full term. In 1952, the Atlanta Constitution published stories regarding a Floyd County court's handling of some traffic tickets. Judge Nichols took exception to accusations of the court's mishandling of the cases. After the Constitution refused to publish information the Judge wanted added, he found Ralph McGill and William Fields in contempt of court and sentenced each to 20 days in jail plus a two hundred dollar fine. McGill was a nationally prominent editor and the story was carried by Time magazine. The contempt citation was reversed by the Supreme Court of Georgia in January 1953. He continued as Superior Court Judge until January 15, 1954 when Governor Herman E. Talmadge appointed him to the Court of Appeals of Georgia. In November 1966, after twelve years on the Court of Appeals, Governor Carl E. Sanders appointed Nichols as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia. In 1975 he became Chief Justice and served until retiring in December 1980. In 1982 he became one of a group of fourteen prominent people who helped establish and founded the Georgia State University College of Law offering an American Bar Association accredited evening curriculum. He died in Atlanta on June 8, 2000 after having suffered a stroke. Clubs and organizations Judge Nichols was a member of the Piedmont Driving Club, the Capital City Club, the Coosa Country Club, Gridiron Secret Society, Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, and Woodmen of the World. Legacy He was known for his support of the death penalty, but his most lasting legacy was the elevation of the Georgia judiciary to a higher level of professionalism and respect. Upon becoming Chief Justice, he insisted on the judiciary receiving the same respect as the executive and legislative branches of government. His development of a unified appeal process in death penalty cases helped to eliminate delays in executing sentences. He allowed both cameras and tape recorders in the courtroom so that the public could have a better understanding of the work of the judiciary.

A prolonged high pressure system over Britain and Ireland caused higher than average temperatures for 19 consecutive days in July, reaching at Heathrow and Northolt. Following a brief period of cooler weather at the end of July, temperatures temporarily rose again, peaking at on 1 August in the United Kingdom, the warmest the country had seen since July 2006, and in Ireland. At 19 days, the July heatwave was the longest continuous period of hot weather in the UK since August 1997. Timeline On 4 July the Met Office predicted a long spell of warm weather over England and Wales to last until the middle of the month, with the south-east set to experience close to , and Scotland and Northern Ireland expected to avoid the warmest weather. In the following week temperatures reached on the south coast and climbed to in Northern Ireland, the highest temperature seen there since 2006. Heat waves in the United Kingdom are declared when the threshold maximum day temperature and a minimum night temperature are exceeded for at least two consecutive days. The threshold temperatures differ region by region, but the average is for the day and for the night. On 12 July, the Met Office released heat wave alerts across much of England, with Yorkshire and the Humber placed in the level three category out of four alert levels. On 17 July, the Met Office upgraded London and South East England to level three following the fifth consecutive day of temperatures over . The heatwave ended on 23 July with heavy thunderstorms, bringing flooding and lightning strikes that caused delays on motorways and railways, power cuts and fires. Despite this, temperatures still remained above average for the time of year. On 29 July, another spell of thunderstorms hit the UK. Manchester for example was hit by three thunderstorms in eight hours. Three days later on 1 August, the temperatures rose again, recording the warmest August temperature since 2003. In some places, 1 August was actually warmer than all of the days in July. London Heathrow recorded , which exceeded the previous record of which was recorded on 22 July. By 2 August however, temperatures began to return to normal.  Impact  On 18 July, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine reported that the first 9 days of the heat wave had caused up to an additional 760 deaths in the UK. = Emergency services = The heat wave led to rises in both the number of calls to the emergency services and admissions to A&E; departments. The large numbers of people using rivers, lakes and the sea to cool off led to a large increase in the number of calls to lifeguards. The London Fire Brigade reported having to deal with double the number of grass fires in the capital compared to the previous year. Wildfires were also reported in Epping Forest in Essex, the Dorset coast, the valleys of southern Wales and Tentsmuir Forest in Scotland. = Ecology = Following declines in the summer of 2012 due to wet and windy conditions, butterfly numbers saw a surge due to the prolonged warm weather. The warmer waters around the British coasts also led to an increase in the number of jellyfish sightings, particularly the moon jellyfish. The death of thousands of fish in rivers and lakes was attributed to the elevated temperatures lowering the amount of oxygen in the water to toxic levels.

Influenced by the Bay Area funk art movement, he is best known for his multiple series of decal plates that rejected traditional studio ceramic practices that emphasized and valued hand- made objects, and focusing instead on mass-produced store-bought plates and commercial decals to create pieces decorated with appropriated images from popular culture to convey Kottler's political, social, and personal messages. Based on these works, he developed a reputation for using coded images, wordplay, and biting humor which established Kottler's reputation as a satirist and decalomaniac. Career Originally trained as an optometrist, Kottler graduated from Ohio State University in 1952 with a Bachelor of Arts in Biological Sciences. While working on his undergrad, he took a university ceramics course in 1952 that shifted his focus and returned to Ohio State to study ceramics. Kottler began his career with a traditional crafts orientation; as a student, he had been trained in traditional ceramic techniques and glaze technology. After earning a Master of Arts in Ceramics from Ohio State in 1956, he was offered a scholarship to undertake a Master of Fine Arts at the Cranbrook Academy of Art. It was there that he met and studied under Maija Grotell, a teacher and artist who profoundly influenced his ideas about art and education. With support of a Fulbright grant, he spent time working at the Central School of Arts and Crafts and at the Arabia Ceramic Factory in Finland, studying the creation and application of ceramic decals and working with renowned potter Kyllikki Salmenhaara. He returned to Ohio State, where he received a Ph.D. in Ceramics in 1964 with his dissertation An Exhibition of Pottery in Support of Three Processes in Ceramics, and later moved to Seattle where he joined the University of Washington faculty in 1965. Work & Collections Not fully appreciated while alive, he has, posthumously, received critical acclaim in response to a number of retrospective exhibitions held in the United States. The output of his work was uneven over the 30 years of his professional life as he was a full-time university professor, it was only in the 80s that he began to work with sufficient intensity to produce a body of work sufficient to result in a one- person show. His works have been collected by New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Art and Design, and Whitney Museum of American Art; the Renwick Gallery, Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto; the Victoria and Albert Museum in London; and Seattle Art Museum, Portland Art Museum, Henry Art Gallery, and Tacoma Art Museum in the Pacific Northwest.

The term is an intentional play on both Adam Smith's invisible hand and Alfred Chandler's Visible Hand. Background In Smith's work, his invisible hand describes the self-regulating behavior of the market. In essence, this theory states that individual personal motivations lead to the most efficient allocation of resources and greatest overall benefit, even if those motivations were not in any way benevolent. This is exemplified by relatively small firms operating with no market control. Competition between buyers and sellers channels the profit motive causing competition to lead to socially desirable outcomes.Sen, Amartya. Introduction. The Theory of Moral Sentiments. By Adam Smith. 6th ed. 1790. New York: Penguin, 2009. vii‚Äìxxix. During Smith's time and much after, this was a justification for a laissez- faire economy. However, in Smith's day there were not several market forces that currently exist, such as large-scale industry, finance, and advertising.Olsen, James Stewart. Encyclopedia of the Industrial Revolution. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002. pp. 153‚Äì154 The Visible hand, however, was believed by Chandler to have replaced the Invisible hand with middle management in the mid 19th century, which became ‚Äúthe most powerful institution in the American economy‚Äù. In short, he states that the multi-unit business structure arose because administrative coordination could yield greater profits than market coordination, giving rise to managerial hierarchy and led to furthered growth and profit. The rise of this new system yielded major sectors of the economy being dominated and altered the structure of markets, steering away from a competitive state and to an economy controlled by corporate managers. In other words, the large scale industries arising began to provide larger social benefits due to managerial presence and long- term scope rather than perfectly competitive markets.Chandler, Alfred. The Visible Hand. Belknap Press, 1977. . Introduction. Vanishing Hand theory Langlois intended to show that Chandler's theory was partially correct but needed some reevaluation. The Vanishing Hand theory, as argued by Dick Langlois: In other words, the Vanishing hand theory states that initially the Visible hand is present as industries require managerial cooperation and vertical integration for long term growth, but eventually fades away to a more Invisible hand in which specialization allows for market forces to coordinate more effectively leading to a quasi-Smithian division of labor. Temporary clusters of firms arose acting under Chandler's Visible hand process that would eventually be replaced by Smith's division of labor and thus Invisible hand. Many of the large, vertically-integrated corporations of the past have broken up in recent years into more specialized firms due to the removal of barriers to trade, such as outsourcing. Specifically it has once more become economically optimal to seek a division of labor, or seek vertical disintegration, rather than integrate. As minimum efficient scale falls firms size should fall as well. When firm size is viewed as firm activity undertaken, this holds true. It is likely, therefore, that as integration becomes costlier in comparison to alternatives, large firms are more likely disintegrate to varying degrees and have a loosened managerial presence, although complete return to a Smithian market is unlikely.

Its chiefs of general staff were: to 1 March 1917, Field Marshal Conrad; from 2 November 1918, Arthur Arz. The AOK was stationed in Teschen in Austrian Silesia until 1916, and then in Baden bei Wien.  World War II  Flag of the commander of an Armeeoberkommando in the Wehrmacht During World War II, an AOK (usually commanded by a Generaloberst (\\"colonel general\\" or above) controlled several army corps and had its own army troops, e.g. heavy artillery, engineers, and other specialist troops that were subordinated to it depending on availability and task. The AOK was the command level between army group and corps. Demands and allocation of logistic supplies usually went straight to the Oberquartiermeister (\\"senior quartermaster\\") of the AOK; the army group command was only involved in situations of crisis. The area of responsibility of an AOK was split into the operational area, which was further subdivided at corps and divisional level, and the army rear area, which was run by the Kommandanten r√ºckw√§rtiges Gebiet (\\"Commander Rear Area\\"; Kor√ºck). In the course of the war, in certain places as a stopgap alongside the AOKs, there were ad hoc formations called armeeabteilungen (\\"army troops\\") and kampfgruppen (\\"battle groups\\"). Such a formation would be named for its commander, and often did not have the usual levels of command support. = Organization of an AOK = The normal organization of an Armeeoberkommando during World War II was as follows: * Commander-in-Chief - Oberbefehlshaber ** Chief of Staff - Chef des Generalstabes - e.g. a major general *Command Division - F√ºhrungsabteilung) **First General Staff Officer (Ia) (Operations) - Erster Generalstabsoffizier (Ia) (Operationen) **Third General Staff Officer (Ic) (Enemy situation) - Dritter Generalstabsoffizier (Ic) (Feindlage) **Fourth General Staff Officer (Id) (Training) - Vierter Generalstabsoffizier (Id) (Ausbildung) **National Socialist Leadership Officer (NSFO; from 1944) - Nationalsozialistischer F√ºhrungsoffizier *Senior Quartermaster's Division (Supplies) - Oberquartiermeisterabteilung (Nachschub) **Senior Quartermaster (O.

Accessed December 8, 2014. Changewater is located on the Musconetcong River southeast of Washington. The community was named for its location at the confluence of the upper and lower branches of the river. Changewater has a post office with ZIP code 07831, which opened on September 26, 1859. History Remains of a trestle constructed by the Warren Railroad across the Musconetcong River at Changewater in 1856, part of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. A station was built nearby. Passenger service ended in 1926, and freight service stopped in 1958. The trestle was removed in 1959. One of the early iron furnaces in the county--known as the Changewater Forge-- was established here in the mid-1700s by Mark Thomson and later purchased by a well known local Van Leer family. Ledgers show Samuel Van Leer's sons B. Van Leer and Isaac Van Leer owning the property in the early 1800s. In 1843, members of a local family--the Castner's--were murdered during an apparent robbery. The crime attracted widespread publicity, and in 1845, two men were convicted and hanged at the Warren County Court House. During the 1800s, a number of industries were attempted in Changewater, including a tannery, woolen factory, flouring mill, picture frame factory, snuff factory, and distillery. In 1874, the village consisted of a looking glass and picture framing factory, a store and post office, a grist mill, and eight residences. By 1918, Changewater had a population of 200, and the A. T. Skerry woolen mill was its only industry.

The film was rated Category III by the Hong Kong motion picture rating system. Plot On a rainy night in Shenzhen, a female prostitute named Sze-kam Oi-yee was strangled to death by female wanted criminal Yip Siu-ngan in order to assume her identity. Ngan poses as Yee and passes the customs and successfully arrives in Hong Kong. After reporting the loss of her ID card, she successfully obtains Yee's identity. Yee has a Hong Kong ID because her husband is a Hong Kong resident, who at the time was waiting for his wife's arrival. Siu-ngan meets a brothel frequenter Chan Kai-ming, a taxi driver who is divorced and left his daughter Yin-yin to be cared by his mother, whom he also rarely interferes with. Ngan chooses Ming as her victim and first runs him over with a car, crippling him, and later sneaks into his house and holds him hostage and asks about him in detail. One night, Ming's mother comes to visit her son and the vicious Ngan kills her so she will not ruin her plan, and defrauds Yin. On the day that Ngan receives her ID card, Yee's husband finds Ngan suspicious and follows her to Ming's house. While he fights with Ngan, her husband, Kwan Fai, arrives and kills him. The couple are both wanted criminals. Fai, who is crippled in both hands, intends to take Ming's identity and his arms. Fai chops off Ming's arms, causing him to die from blood loss, and Fai attaches Ming's arms to himself and successfully obtains Ming's identity. Just as their plan seems successful, Yin escapes from the two and is found by construction workers. The truth is revealed, and Ngan and Fai are once again wanted by the Hong Kong police. Setting foot on the road to escape again, Ngan quotes to Fai, \\"blame the moment that I was softhearted, I was not cruel enough before, but it does not matter, I will do better next time.\\" Cast *Jacklyn Wu as Yip Siu-ngan *Wayne Lai as Chan Kai-ming *Moses Chan as Kwan Fai *Bonnie Wong as Chan Kai-ming's mother *Yuen Bun as Sze-kam Oi- yee's husband *Yuki Lai as Yin-yin *Lam Suet as Cleaning river entrance *Hung Wai-leung as Cleaning river entrance *Choi Kwok-leung *Wong Man-chun as Policeman Box office The film grossed HK$446,790 at the Hong Kong box office during its theatrical run from 29 November to 4 December 1997 in Hong Kong.

It has been responsible for some of the ongoing violence in Libya, though the degree of its involvement has been disputed in a number of instances. Sympathy for Gaddafi and his fallen government is viewed rather negatively by current Libyan authorities‚Äîboth the legal government and extralegal militias‚Äîand parts of general society in postwar Libya, and even accusations of it can provoke harsh responses. In May 2012, the democratically elected postwar government passed legislation imposing severe penalties for anyone giving favourable publicity to Gaddafi, his family, their regime or ideas, as well as anything denigrating the new government and its institutions or otherwise judged to be damaging to public morale. Derisively called tahloob (\\"algae\\") by anti-Gaddafi Libyans, suspected loyalists have faced strong persecution following the war. Around 7,000 loyalist soldiers, as well as civilians accused of support for Gaddafi are being held in government prisons. Amnesty International has reported large scale torture and other mistreatment and executions, of those perceived as enemies of the new government. Reports and rumours of organised pro-Gaddafi activity have persisted since the war's end. The Libyan Popular National Movement was organised in exile on 15 February 2012 (the first anniversary of the protests that led to the civil war) by former officials in the Gaddafi government. The party, banned from participating in Libyan elections, may have also cultivated links with armed pro-Gaddafi groups in Libya. Statements from the party sometimes appear on websites affiliated with the so-called \\"Green Resistance\\" (after the sole colour of Gaddafi's flag), a term sometimes used by sympathisers to refer to supposed pro-Gaddafi militant groups.Nkrumah, Gamal. Libya's apocalyptic slough . Al Akhram Weekly. 1 March 2012. 2011 =End of the civil war= Following Gaddafi's fall, several states, such as Venezuela, refused to accept the National Transitional Council as the legitimate government, opting to continue recognising the former Gaddafi government. In Libya, loyalists either fled to foreign countries or went into hiding to avoid prosecutions. Shortly before his capture, Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam appeared on Syrian pro-Gaddafi television on 22 October in an attempt to rally remaining loyalists claiming \\"I am in Libya, I am alive and free and willing to fight to the end and take revenge.\\" =Zawiya fighting= Several days of fighting between fighters from Zawiya and fighters from Warshefana erupted in early November after the fighters from Warshefana set up a checkpoint on a highway near Zawiya and began challenging fighters from the city. Other reports stated that the groups were fighting over the Imaya military base, with Zawiya fighters claiming to be fighting Gaddafi loyalists. Zawiya field commander Walid bin Kora claimed that the Warshefana, riding in vehicles with \\"Brigade of the Martyr Muhammad Gaddafi\\" written on them and flying Gaddafi's green flag, had attacked his men. He also claimed that his men captured pro-Gaddafi \\"mercenaries\\" from sub-Saharan Africa. NTC figures, however, denied that they were Gaddafi loyalists, blaming the clashes instead on a misunderstanding. The fighting resulted in between 7 and 14 dead. The National Transitional Council claimed to have resolved the issue over the weekend of the 12 and 13 November following a meeting with elders from Zawiya and Warshefana. =Capture of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi= On 19 November, Saif al-Islam and four loyalist fighters were captured west of the town of Ubari near Sabha in southern Libya. A nomad who had been hired to guide them in their planned escape to Niger secretly told government forces where Saif al- Islam and his two-vehicle convoy would be passing through. Acting on this information, the Zintan brigade blocked off the area and arrested them on sight. Saif al-Islam was taken to Zintan by plane and, pending trial, he is kept in detention by the Zintan militia. =Bani Walid ambush= On 23 November, clashes erupted as a National Transitional Council militia tried to apprehend a suspected loyalist in Bani Walid, which was one of the last pro- Gaddafi strongholds in the civil war. At least seven people were reported killed, five of them NTC militia. 2012 =Sirte= In January 2012, residents of Sirte, Gaddafi's hometown, attacked a military camp associated with the NTC on the outskirts of the city. =Zuwara clashes= On 1 April, between 21 and 34 Zuwara militiamen were detained by members of a neighbouring town's militia. Fighters from Ragdalein stated that they captured the men after months of abuses by a Zuwara brigade, including the looting of property. For their part, the Zuwara local council head accused Ragdalein of being a hub of Gaddafi loyalists. A third version of the events came from the government Interior Ministry which stated that the trouble started when a Zuwara hunting party close to nearby al-Jumail shot and killed a person from that town by mistake. The hunters were then arrested but released later. Another Zuwara council head claimed that the men were tortured before being released and stated that Zuwara came under mortar and anti-aircraft fire by militias from both Ragdalein and al-Jumail. On 3 April, reports emerged that the fighting in the Zuwara area was still continuing with at least one Zuwara militiaman killed and five wounded. The losses for militia from Ragdalein and al-Jumail were not known. Clashes were reported at the entrance to Ragdalein while groups in al-Jumail were shelling Zuwara. At least 14 were killed and 80 injured. On 4 April, the fighting escalated with the use of tanks and artillery. The reported number of dead was said to had risen to 26, eight from Zuwarah and 18 from the outlying towns, and another 142 Zuwarans were wounded. Unconfirmed reports rose up the death toll to 48 killed in the clashes.The situation in Libya UN Security Council, 6768th meeting, 10 May 2012. BBC News aired a report on the story, confirming a number dead. The report also aired an interview with a wounded man from Zarawa, claiming to have been attacked by what he called \\"Gaddafi loyalists\\". There is no confirmation as to whether or not the clashes had anything to do with the guerrillas. =Ghat skirmishes= On 6 April, French leading newspaper Le Figaro reported that a dozen people were killed near the border town of Ghat on 1 and 2 April in fighting between former pro-Gaddafi Tuaregs and the Zintan tribe. The town of Ghat, in the deserts of southwest Libya, was a stronghold of Gaddafi during his reign. It was the last town in Libya to recognise the new government. Since the fall of Gaddafi, it has been suspected of continuing to be a base of loyalist sentiment. No area in Libya has had as many officials disbarred due to links to the Gaddafi government. The present government has banned its two council members, the local council leader, the secretary to the council, its financial controller, the head of security services, and the heads of the sanitation department and the border guards. =Zintan clashes= Tribal clashes in Zintan broke out on 17 June, after a Zintan man was killed after stopping at a checkpoint while attempting to transport tanks from a weapons depot in Mizda to Zintan. While the Zintanis had played a prominent role fighting in favour of the NTC during the civil war, the neighbouring Mashashya tribe had chosen to side with the Gaddafi government during the civil war. The Mashashya tribe chose to side with the Gaddafi government, whilst fighters from Zintan played a prominent role, fighting in favour of the NTC. This, combined with a dispute over land and bitterness over prisoners of war from Mashashya, led to the fighting. It is unclear if Green Resistance had a role in instigating the violence. As a result of the fierce fighting between the different tribes, government troops were deployed to the area on 17 June. The area was subsequently declared a military zone. The deployment of soldiers and imposition of a government enforced ceasefire managed to prevent further clashes, with government spokesman Nasser al-Manaa declaring that fighting had ended on 18 June. =Tripoli= In August 2012, claims surfaced of loyalist remnants attempting to smuggle weapons into Libya in an effort to destabilise the government. A member of the group in Tripoli's Abu Salim neighbourhood, a former pro-Gaddafi stronghold, claimed in an August 2012 interview that loyalist militia were rebuilding their strength and waiting for the right moment to move against the new government. Saadi Gaddafi was claimed to support the group whilst under house arrest in Niger.Gaddafi's son leading former regime's revival World Bulletin. 24 January 2014 He warned in early 2012 that he was in contact with sleeper cells who were organising underground resistance. In addition to his son Saadi, Muammar Gaddafi's nephew Ahmad Gaddaf al-Damm, living in hiding in Egypt, was also accused of supporting violent pro-Gaddafi activity. Col. Khamid Bilhayr of the Libyan National Army claimed that other loyalist figures outside the country were sending large quantities of money and support to loyalist groups inside Libya. Others claim that despite the group's rhetoric, its operations were limited to bombings and minor instances of sabotage. They were believed to have been behind a bombing outside the headquarters of the Military Police on 10 August. On 19 August, two people were killed and up to five were injured when a car bomb went off at dawn near the former military academy for women. Another car bomb exploded at the same time near the interior ministry, but no one was harmed. The bombings occurred on the eve of the anniversary of the Battle of Tripoli. Tripoli's head of security, Col. Mahmoud Sherif, blamed Gaddafi loyalists for the attack, and the following day Libyan authorities announced they had arrested 32 members of a pro-Gaddafi network in connection with the bombings. On the same day as the arrests, a bomb was placed under the car of an Egyptian diplomat. The bomb exploded, but nobody was injured. The incident was also blamed by the government on Gaddafi loyalists. =Raid on Katibat Al-Awfiyah brigade= On 23 August, Interior ministry spokesman Abdelmonem al-Hur claimed that more than a hundred tanks and twenty-six rocket launchers were seized from an alleged pro-Gaddafi militia (named Katibat Al-Awfiyah, or Brigade of the Faithful), during a government raid on their campsite in Tarhuna. The operation ended with one of the fighters killed, eight wounded and thirteen detained‚Äîincluding the commander‚Äîand accused of being linked with 19 August Tripoli bombings. Three fighters managed to escape. =Death of Omran Shaban= Omran Shaban, the man held most responsible for the extrajudicial killing of Gaddafi, was abducted by suspected Gaddafi loyalists in Bani Walid in July. He was imprisoned and tortured for two months before being released in September due to government pressure on Bani Walid. He was sent to France for medical treatment, but died of his wounds the same month. The rebels responsible have so far eluded capture or death. =Bani Walid= On 9 September, local militia in Bani Walid drove government forces from the town. Initial reports claimed that a supposed Gaddafi loyalist group called \\"Brigade 93\\" was responsible for the takeover, although the Bani Walid town elders later denied this, and proclaimed support for the removal of Gaddafi. The elders stated that the accusations of pro-Gaddafi sympathies were orchestrated by the media, and that the town instead was fighting for the removal of the NTC military administration of the town and its replacement by a local council. =Brak ambush= On 21 September, government forces were ambushed by alleged Gaddafi loyalists in the city of Brak in south west Libya. Nine soldiers were killed in the attack, with no information of casualties from the attackers. 2014 On 18 January, the Libyan air force attacked targets in the south of Libya because of unrest blamed on forces loyal to slain leader Muammar Gaddafi. The government also declared a state of emergency after Gaddafi loyalists took over the Tamahind air force base near the southern city of Sabha. On 22 January Voice of Russia featured a report with Libyans who claimed that much of the southern half of the country as well as Bani Walid had fallen under the control of the \\"Green\\" Gaddafi loyalists, and that some foreign Libyan embassies were flying the Gaddafi-era green flag in support. The interviewed Libyans claimed to be fighting against a Western-backed \\"puppet government\\" with ties to Al-Qaeda, and charged that Qatar was paying Sudanese pilots to bomb their positions.Green Libyan flags are waving once again - Interview. The Voice of Russia. 22 January 2014. On the other hand, the more government-friendly Libya Herald newspaper reported that a large contingent of Gaddafi-friendly fighters were scattered near Ajilat as they tried to aid other Gaddafi-loyalists in Sabha, with five of them killed. The report claimed that if the events were part of a coordinated movement, \\"it does not appear to be well organised, let alone have any significant or measurable support.\\"Wahab, Ashraf Abdul. Qaddafi supporters heading to Ajilat killed in Sabratha: report. Libya Herald. 22 January 2014. On 22 January, the Libyan General National Congress passed Decree 5/2014, Concerning the Cessation and Ban on the Broadcasting of Certain Satellite Channels, aimed at censoring pro-Gaddafi satellite television stations such as al-Khadra (The Green Channel) and al-Nedaa (the Libyan Popular National Movement's channel). Reporters Without Borders subsequently issued a statement calling for the withdrawal of the decree.Reporters Without Borders. Libya: Freedom of Information in Jeopardy in Post-Gaddafi Libya. AllAfrica. 30 January 2014. On 24 January, nine soldiers were killed and 27 injured near Tripoli in clashes with Gaddafi loyalists.Army: 9 soldiers killed in clashes with gunmen . Afrique en Ligne. 24 January 2014. 2015 On 4 August dozens of Gaddafi loyalists staged a rare public demonstration in Benghazi (the only pro-Gaddafi gathering in the city as of yet), chanting pro-Gaddafi slogans and waving the flag of the Jamahiriya, in response to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi's death sentence. The protest was later dispersed after anti-Gaddafi militia opened fire and threw rocks, although no one was reported injured. Continuous fighting was also alleged to have erupted between pockets of pro-Gaddafi militants and ISIL forces in Gaddafi's former hometown of Sirte. Furthermore, protests were reported across the Libyan south, in particular the city of Sabha, where at least four protestors were reported dead after opponents opened fire. Protests were also reported in Tobruk, triggering a large counter-demonstration from those in favour of the 2011 revolution. Another protest happened on 7 August in Bani Walid, a city that was a stronghold of pro-Gaddafi loyalists. 2016 On 5 May, Gaddafi loyalists alongside with soldiers loyal to Khalifa Haftar captured the town of Zella after an intense battle with Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya fighters near Sirte. Some loyalists joined the Battle of Sirte on the side of the GNA. On 23 December, a Gaddafi loyalist hijacked a plane which was flying from Sabha to Tripoli and was diverted to Malta. 2018 Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of Muammar Gaddafi, announced on 22 March 2018 that he will run for president of Libya, in the 2019 Libyan General Election. On May 20, a delegation of Gaddafi exiled supporters comprising three former high-ranking military officials, three activists and a university professor that have being invited to a reconciliation meeting in Tripoli were detained on charges of planning violent acts to destabilize the capital. On September 1, shy celebrations marking the 49th anniversary of Al Fateh Revolution spread over several cities including Sabha, Sirte, Benghazi and Tripoli suburbs. On September 2, hundreds of prisoners, including Gaddafi supporters, escaped from Ain Zara prison in the southern suburbs of Tripoli, in a mass jail break during clashes in the city between the Tripoli Revolutionaries Brigade and Nawasi Brigade against the 7th Brigade from Tarhuna.Hundreds escape prison near Libya's Tripoli: police Yahoo News (Agence France-Presse), September 2, 2018 2020 On August 20, dozens of Gaddafi supporters held demonstrations in Sirte, Bani Walid and Ghat.http://alwasat.ly/news/libya/292937 ÿ™ÿ∏ÿßŸáÿ±ÿßÿ™ ŸÑÿ£ŸÜÿµÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ∏ÿßŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿßÿ®ŸÇ ŸÅŸä ÿ®ŸÜŸä ŸàŸÑŸäÿØ Ÿàÿ≥ÿ±ÿ™ Ÿàÿ∫ÿßÿ™ On August 24, supporters of the Gaddafi family once again gathered in Sirte, with reports of clashes between the LNA and the protestors. 50 civilians had been detained since the start of the demonstrations in Sirte.Large demonstration held in support of Gaddafi family in northern Libya: video Al Masdar News, 25 August 2020 On September 1, Gaddafi supporters celebrated the 51st anniversary of the Al Fateh Revolution taking to the streets of several towns like Ajaylat, Tiji (Al-Sayan), Bani Walid and Sabha.Gaddafi supporters rally in support of family on anniversary of rise to power: video Al Masdar News, 1 September 2020 References Category:Aftermath of the Libyan Civil War (2011) Category:Libyan Civil War (2011) Category:Libyan Civil War (2014‚Äìpresent) Category:Muammar Gaddafi Category:Political movements in Libya Category:Politics of Libya ","title":"Gaddafi loyalism"},{"id":"40064549","text":"\\"Love Love Love\\" is the debut single from New Zealand folk band Avalanche City.

In 1177, the Crown's clerical appointment rights were transferred by King Valdemar to Ringsted Abbey, which continued to have responsibility over Halsted Priory. At the time of the Reformation, ownership returned to the Crown, which retained it until 1719 when Halsted Priory was transferred to Jens Juel-Vind in exchange for Juellinge on Zealand. It was subsequently owned by members of the Juel-Vind family. After the barony was dissolved in 1921, the church came under ownership of the adjoining main building, named Halsted Kloster. In 1987, Mogens-Krag-Juel-Vind-Frijs returned ownership to the church itself. Architecture Halsted Church The main entrance The church was originally a Romanesque building with a nave, chancel, apse and possibly a tower. Remains of the chancel and nave survive in the masonry of today's structure. When it became the priory church at the end of the 13th century, the chancel was extended to the east, its three-sided gable replacing the former apse. The church formed the northern wing of a four- winged priory of which nothing remains today. In 1510, the L√ºbeckers burnt down the abbey, probably also destroying the church's Romanesque tower. During the 16th century the church was extended towards the west. A low tower was built at the west end and was rebuilt in the 1870s. In 1636, Borkvard Rud obtained rights to build the north chapel as a burial chapel for the owners of nearly S√¶byholm. The church was fully restored from 1868 to 1877.\\"Halsted klosterkirke\\", Nordens kirker. Retrieved 25 July 2013.\\"Beskrivelse\\", Halsted Kirke. Retrieved 25 July 2013. Interior The 15th-century triptych altarpiece J√∏rgen Ringnis auricular pulpit (1636) Vaults were introduced at the beginning of the 16th century, with three cross-vaults in the nave, two star-shaped vaults in the chancel and a five-sectioned vault at the end of the chancel. The late 15th-century altarpiece is a Gothic triptych with a scene of the crucifixion in the centre and saints and apostles on the two wings. The auricular chancel screen from 1671 with the 11 apostles and Christ's baptism was probably crafted by Henrik Werner. A Baroque altarpiece which crowned the altar from 1750 to 1877, when it was replaced by the 15th-century work, can now be seen on the north wall of the chancel. The auricular pulpit (1636), displaying representations of Faith, Hope and Charity as well as the arms of Prince Christian and Princess Magdalene Sibylle, is the work of J√∏rgen Ringnis. The font from c. 1750 is probably from the same workshop as the Baroque altarpiece. Graveyard Johan Wegner (1811-1883), pastor and headmaster of R√∏dding H√∏jskole, is interred in the graveyard.

Her 1917 text How to Write for Moving Pictures: A Manual of Instruction and Information reflected and influenced the screenwriters of the era.Somerville, Siobhan B. (2002). \\"The Queer Career of Jim Crow: Racial and Sexual Transformation in A Florida Enchantment.\\" In Bean, Jennifer M.; Negra, Diane. A Feminist Reader in Early Cinema. Durham, NC: Duke University Press. pp. 256-257. . In the early days of film it was not uncommon for \\"scenario writers\\" to be women and she was among those who, beginning in 1916, also directed films.Women Filmmakers in Early Hollywood by Karen Ward Mahar, pgs 182-183 However, she would later be called one of the \\"forgotten women\\" of silent film as the non-acting women of early film largely became obscure.Robert and Frances Flaherty by Robert J. Christopher, pg 419 Prints of two films that Bertsch had worked on as a screenwriter were rediscovered in the Netherlands, at the Nederlands Filmmuseum. These newly discovered films, The Diver and The Troublesome Step- Daughter, and the 1914 film A Florida Enchantment, are currently the only films from Bertsch's career that have been recovered. The rest are presumed to be lost.  Career  Bertsch began her film career with Vitagraph in 1913, starting as a scenario writer. In 1916, she became the head of the screenwriting department, and began working as a director for the company. Her first directorial output was the 1916 film The Law Decides, which she directed with William P.S. Earle. Several months later, she directed her first solo feature, The Devil's Prize. This was considered to be an unusual film for a woman director and writer, as it was a \\"tangled tale of illegitimate pregnancy, abandonment, and murder. She also may have worked as an editor and screenwriter for the Famous Players Film Company, but the dates for this work are unknown. For reasons that are unknown, Bertsch stopped working for the Vitagraph company in 1918, when she was considered to be at the height of her career. There is no record of any film work by her after this point.  Early life  Bertsch was born in New York City, and was educated at Columbia University. She worked as a playwright and a public school teacher before beginning her career as a screenwriter with Vitagraph Studios in 1913. Very little is known about Bertsch's life outside of her career, but it has been suggested that she was a supporter of the Social Reform movement. In How To Write For Moving Pictures, she argued against writing \\"anything that might stir up in [the audience] vulgar feelings or sexual thoughts.\\" The film historian Siobhan B. Somerville has argued that Vitagraph's adaptation of the novel A Florida Enchantment, for which Bertsch was the lead screenwriter, reflects this ideology. A number of overtly sexual scenes from the book were cut, as well as scenes dealing with racial issues. This may also be due to the Vitagraph's interest in making \\"respectable\\" films. The historian R. Bruce Basell further argues that Bertsch's screenplay for the film shows an opposition to the women's emancipation movement, as it suggests that there will be societal chaos if emancipation is achieved. There is very little public information about her life between 1918, when she left Vitagraph, and 1967, when she is believed to have died. Census records from the states of New York and New Jersey suggest that between 1930 and 1941, she was living with various family members and may have been working as a freelance writer.

He and Wilhelm Vogel were the only two inmates who succeeded in escaping the Osthofen concentration camp.  Life  A son of Orthodox Jewish Russian immigrants, Max Tschornicki was born in 1903 in R√ºsselsheim. As a student, he belonged to several Jewish youth associations and joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany. Later he became a member of the Social Democratic Party and the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold. After attending high school in Mainz, he studied law and practiced as an attorney in Mainz, defending principally Social Democrats and Reichsbanner members. Tschornicki was active in the opposition to Nazism. On 24 May 1933 he was arrested on the basis of the Reichstag Fire Decree and imprisoned at Osthofen, one of the first Nazi concentration camps. With the aid of his fianc√©e and two other inmates, Philipp Wahl and Christoph Weitz, he succeeded in escaping the camp on 3 July 1933. As a result of his escape, security at the camp was significantly tightened, several inmates were severely punished and his family was taken into \\"protective custody\\". He escaped to the Saar, then a League of Nations Mandate, and later to Toulouse and Lyon. After the German occupation of France in 1940 he joined the French R√©sistance. He was arrested in 1944 and sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp on 11 August 1944. Subsequently, he was moved to other camps. On 20 April 1945, he died of dysentery in Allach-Untermenzing, at a satellite camp of the Dachau concentration camp, nine days before the camp was liberated by Allied forces.  Biographical works  Tschornicki related his experiences as an exile in France to Anna Seghers, who used them in her novel Das siebte Kreuz,Drobisch/Wieland, p. 169 written in 1938 and 1939. The Chawwerusch- Theater in Herxheim adapted Tschornicki's biography as a play in 2013. It adapts texts by Seghers, St√©phane Hessel, Walter Benjamin and Wolf Biermann's translation of the Yiddish workers' song Sol sajn. The play was performed, among other venues, at the memorial site for the Osthofen concentration camp.

He currently resides and works in Todi, Italy. Ceccobelli was one of the six artists of the Nuova Scuola Romana or Scuola di San Lorenzo, an artistic movement that grew out of the Arte Povera and Transavanguardia movements of the latter twentieth century.  Life  He wrote: \\"I do not want to be a market-fan artist, but to belong to all times, and this is why I believe in a foreseeing art, not just historical or literary or sociological or stylistic. I believe in a symbolic art, capable to offer a message and to pacify the world\\". In 1975, he first took part in a group exhibition in the Town Hall of Albach, Austria, and, two years later, he had his first solo exhibition at the Alternative Space Gallery in Rome, where he exhibited works of conceptual art. He also participated in two group exhibitions at La Stanza, an independent space self-managed by young artists. In the early 1980s, Ceccobelli and other artists settled in the former Pastificio Cerere, a large abandoned industrial space located in the San Lorenzo quarter in Rome. The group, known as the New Roman School or San Lorenzo Workshop, included Piero Pizzi Cannella, Marco Tirelli, Giuseppe Gallo, Gianni Dess√¨, Nunzio Di Stefano and Domenico Bianchi. The Italian art critic Achille Bonito Oliva wrote that these artists were \\"all bearers of individual poetics and all streams towards a common aesthetic mentality and a moral vision of art\\". In the following years he had a number of international exhibitions: in 1979, at the Festival of Italian Culture in Belgrade and, subsequently, group exhibitions in France, Germany, and Croatia. At Yvon Lambert in Paris he exhibited Morpheus. Artista Re (1987), paper on wood, graphite and wax, 160 x 205 cm The 1990s started with exhibitions in Germany, Austria, Canada and Italy. In 1994 he was invited to give a training course at the Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Artes in Senegal, an experience that would leave a deep influence in his life. Leda (2000), travertine In 1999 Arturo Schwarz is the curator of Ceccobelli's exhibition ‚ÄúTrascorsi d‚ÄôAsfalto‚Äù at the Guastalla Centro Arte Gallery (Livorno) and in the same year he exhibits in Bilbao (Luis Borgus) During the Jubilee Year (2000) he is entrusted with the realization of the huge portals in iron corten and bronze for the Cathedral of Terni, in Italy. In 2002 Ceccobelli celebrates at the B.M.B. Gallery his twenty years of exhibitions in Dutch Galleries. The next year he publishes the book Color Bellezza, a collection of his essays expressing his longing for a forthcoming aesthetic society. Also in 2005 he holds his important solo-exhibition ‚ÄúClassico Eclettico‚Äù at the Archeological Museum of Villa Adriana in Tivoli (Roma). In 2004 Ceccobelli realizes the mosaic ‚ÄúEternity is the true healer‚Äù in Gibellina (Sicily) and the year after the Guastalla Gallery in Livorno presents the anthological exhibition ‚ÄúBig Works 1989-2005‚Äù. In the same year he writes the book Tempo senza tempo della pittura, which is a collection of comparisons about yesterday's and today's artists, an opportunity to theorize his aesthetical arguments. In 2005 he is appointed as Director of the Academy of fine arts ‚ÄúPietro Vannucci‚Äù of Perugia, Italy. In 2006 Ceccobelli presents a series of marble sculptures in Verona and in Pietrasanta at the gallery Spirale Arte, and participates in the important group exhibition ‚ÄúSan Lorenzo‚Äù at Villa Medici (Roma).

Also in 2009, the Museum of Contemporary Art (MaRT) of Rovereto presented the first retrospective exhibition dedicated to the Officina San Lorenzo, which traced the history of that group. The exhibition catalogue, was published by Silvana Editorale and edited by Daniela Lancioni. In 2010 he takes part of the group-exhibition at the Limen 895 Gallery ‚ÄúSan Lorenzo, la soglia del‚Äôarte‚Äù, curated by Achille Bonito Oliva (Roma) and is in the 16th Biennale of contemporary sacred art organized by the Italian Foundation Staur√≥s (Isola del Gran Sasso).

Rodriguez, at the Museum of Abruzzo People (Pescara 2010), which, for the first time ever, shows Ceccobelli's main graphic works. In the same year the Anfiteatro Arte Gallery (Padova) organizes the retrospective ‚ÄúEarly Works‚Äù, which gives a survey of the extraordinary period between 1982 and 1992. In 2010 Ceccobelli publishes his third book, Gratiaplena. Economia della grazia, which contains his spiritual legacy in the form of a collection of inspired writings on aesthetic and society. Among the numerous events in 2011, we must cite the exhibition ‚ÄúSch√∂ne Tr√§ume‚Äù (Rovereto), in which the artist tries to capture the beauty of the dreams impressed on pillow cases. It is also the year of the participation in the important exhibition ‚ÄúGrandi opere‚Ä¶grandi‚Äù at the Marconi Foundation (Milan) and in the Lazio Stand at the Venice Biennale (curated by Vittorio Sgarbi).

When grown on MacConkey agar, pathogenic isolates often develop a darkened raised centre.\\"Bordetellosis in Poultry - Poultry\\". Merck Veterinary Manual. Retrieved 2020-09-21.  Epidemiology  This pathogen has a worldwide distribution but is found at the highest density in the North Temperate Zone between the arctic circle and the Tropic of Cancer. Outbreaks have been recorded in many countries including the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, and South Africa and in are most often recorded during the summer and fall. Due to the highly contagious and transmissible nature of this bacterium, the prevalence in bird species is abundant. B. avium can remain in the environment in litter and water for as long as 6 months and has a short incubation of only 7-10 days allowing for rapid transmission. Prevalence is highest and most well understood in domesticated turkeys. Prevalence is especially high in younger turkey populations consisting of birds 1-6 weeks old, although turkeys of all ages are susceptible. In addition, much of the transmission is thought to relate to management practices and outbreaks are often associated with farms with confined spaces and flocks consisting of animals of varying ages. Older animals are thought to be carriers of this bacterium which is why it is recommend that turkey farmers avoid multi-age flocks. Although most common in domestic turkeys, B. avium can transmit to chickens as an opportunistic infection, and wildlife species, where prevalence is still being evaluated. It has been suggested that wildlife species act mainly as a reservoir and it is unclear if B. avium acts as part of the normal flora in wild bird populations or is a causative agent of disease. Despite the fact that wild birds are commonly asymptomatic, Bordetellosis has been reported in a variety of wild birds including parrot finches, partridges, cockatiels, and ostriches, among others. In one study by Raffel et.al, in a sample of 46 Canadian Geese, 67% tested positive for B. avium using a serum agglutination test for antibodies. Although many studies have begun to look at characterizing the epidemiology of this bacterium, the understanding of prevalence in different countries and among different species of domestic and wild birds remains to be fully understood.

Shearer was an engineering and farm machinery manufacturer based in Mannum between 1882 and 1912, founded by John (1845‚Äì1932) and David Shearer (1850‚Äì1936), and continued separately as John Shearer & Sons of Kilkenny, South Australia, and David Shearer & Co. (later David Shearer Ltd.) of Mannum. History John and David Shearer were two of a family of six children born to Peter Shearer (c. 1808 ‚Äì 31 July 1891) and his wife Mary (c. 1814 ‚Äì 28 May 1908) in Orkney. The family migrated to South Australia in the Omega, arriving in South Australia on 24 August 1852, living first at Port Adelaide, where their father pursued his trade of stonemason, then at Clare, where the youngest boys attended the local school. At the age of twelve David left to work on a property at Hoyleton, and after two years enrolled with J. S. Cole's Stanley Grammar School in Watervale for a year's tuition; the fees paid for out of his savings. He then worked for two years at his brother William's blacksmith shop at Leasingham. At age 18 he went to work in W. Patterson & Co.'s foundry in Clare. When that business failed he moved to the other end of town where J. G. Ramsay of Mount Barker had a workshop. . John served his apprenticeship with J. G. Ramsay, a farming implement merchant and manufacturer of Mount Barker and in 1876 set up a workshop and smithy in Mannum, where David joined him in 1877, repairing farm equipment and paddle- steamers. Between 1877 and 1904 they designed and manufactured agricultural equipment. In 1888 they started manufacture of a wrought ploughshare using a resilient grade of steel developed for him by Meadow's company in England.

Clarence's brother R. Bowyer Smith of Kalkabury (north of Maitland) has been recognised as the inventor. which he manufactured from 1884. The company John Shearer and Sons was registered in 1923. In 1904 the two partners, each wishing to concentrate on their own specialities, separated as far as manufacturing was concerned, then dissolved their partnership in 1910. Other interests David Shearers steam powered car *In 1898 David Shearer built Australia's first motor car. Steam powered, it had a horizontal boiler with a working pressure of made by his nephew J.

Coupling coefficients are used in resonator filter theory. Resonators may be both electromagnetic and acoustic. Coupling coefficients together with resonant frequencies and external quality factors of resonators are the generalized parameters of filters. In order to adjust the frequency response of the filter it is sufficient to optimize only these generalized parameters.  Evolution of the term  This term was first introduced in filter theory by M Dishal.Dishal, M. (Sept. 1949) \\"Design of dissipative band-pass filters producing desired exact amplitude-frequency characteristics\\", Proc. IRE, Vol. 37, No. 9, P. 1050‚Äì1069. In some degree it is an analog of coupling coefficient of coupled inductors. Meaning of this term has been improved many times with progress in theory of coupled resonators and filters. Later definitions of the coupling coefficient are generalizations or refinements of preceding definitions. = Coupling coefficient considered as a positive constant = Earlier well-known definitions of the coupling coefficient of resonators are given in monograph by G. Matthaei et al.Matthaei,G.L., Young, L., Jones, E.M.T. \\"Microwave filters, impedance-matching networks, and coupling structures\\", Artech House, Inc., Norwood. (1980) 1096 p. Note that these definitions are approximate because they were formulated in the assumption that the coupling between resonators is sufficiently small. The coupling coefficient k for the case of two equal resonators is defined by formula k=f_o-f_e/f_0, (1) where f_e, f_o are the frequencies of even and odd coupled oscillations of unloaded pair of the resonators and f_0=\\\\sqrt{f_ef_o}. It is obvious that the coupling coefficient defined by formula (2) is a positive constant that characterizes interaction of resonators at the resonant frequency f_0. In case when an appropriate equivalent network having an impedance or admittance inverter loaded at both ports with resonant one-port networks may be matched with the pair of coupled resonators with equal resonant frequencies, the coupling coefficient k is defined by the formula k=\\\\frac{K_{12}}{\\\\sqrt{x_1x_2}} (2) for series-type resonators and by the formula k=\\\\frac{J_{12}}{\\\\sqrt{b_1b_2}} (3) for parallel-type resonators. Here K_{12}, J_{12} are impedance-inverter and admittance-inverter parameters, x_1, x_2 are reactance slope parameters of the first and the second resonant series-type networks at resonant frequency f_0, and b_1, b_2 are the susceptance slope parameters of the first and the second resonant parallel-type networks. When the resonators are resonant LC-circuits the coupling coefficient in accordance with (2) and (3) takes the value k_L=\\\\frac{L_m}{\\\\sqrt{L_1L_2}} (4) for the circuits with inductive coupling and the value k_C=\\\\frac{C_m}{\\\\sqrt{(C_1+C_m)(C_2+C_m)}}. (5) for the circuits with capacitive coupling. Here L_1, C_1 are the inductance and the capacitance of the first circuit, L_2, C_2 are the inductance and the capacitance of the second circuit, and L_m, C_m are mutual inductance and mutual capacitance. Formulas (4) and (5) are known for a long time in theory of electrical networks. They represent values of inductive and capacitive coupling coefficients of the coupled resonant LC-circuits. = Coupling coefficient considered as a constant having a sign = Refinement of the approximate formula (1) was fulfilled in.Tyurnev,V.V., Belyaev, B.A. (1990) \\"Interaction of parallel microstrip resonators\\", Elektronnaya tekhnika. Ser. Elektronika SVCh, Issue 4(428), P. 25‚Äì30 (in Russian). Exact formula has a form k=\\\\frac{f_o^2-f_e^2}{f_o^2+f_e^2}. (6) Formulae (4) and (5) were used while deriving this expression. Now formula (6) is universally recognized. It is given in highly cited monograph by J-S. Hong.Hong, J-S., \\"Microstrip filters for RF/microwave applications\\", Hoboken, John Wiley & Sons, (2011). It is seen that the coupling coefficient k has a negative value if f_o In accordance with new definition (6), the value of the inductive coupling coefficient of resonant LC-circuits k_L is expressed by formula (4) as before. It has a positive value when L_m>0 and a negative value when L_m<0. Whereas the value of the capacitive coupling coefficient of resonant LC-circuits k_C is always negative. In accordance with (6), the formula (5) for the capacitive coupling coefficient of resonant circuits takes a different form k_C=\\\\frac{-C_m}{\\\\sqrt{(C_1+C_m)(C_2+C_m)}}. (7) Coupling between electromagnetic resonators may be realized both by magnetic or electric field. Coupling by magnetic field is characterized by the inductive coupling coefficient k_L and coupling by electric field is characterized by the capacitive coupling coefficient k_C. Usually absolute values of k_L and k_C monotonically decay when the distance between the resonators increases. Their decay rates may be different. However absolute value of their sum may both decay all over distance range and grow over some distance range.Belyaev, B.A., Titov, M.M., Tyurnev, V.V. (2000) \\"Coupling coefficient of irregular microstrip resonators\\", Radiophysics and Quantum Electronics, Vol. 43, No 8, P. 649‚Äì653. Summation of the inductive and capacitive coupling coefficients is performed by formula k=\\\\frac{k_L+k_C}{1+k_Lk_C}. (8) This formula is derived from the definition (6) and formulas (4) and (7). Note that the sign of the coupling coefficient k itself is of no importance. Frequency response of the filter will not change if signs of all the coupling coefficients would be simultaneously alternated. However, the sign is important during collation of two coupling coefficients and especially during summation of inductive and capacitive coupling coefficients. = Coupling coefficient considered as a function of the forced oscillation frequency = Two coupled resonators may interact not only at the resonant frequencies. That is supported by ability to transfer energy of forced oscillations from one resonator to the other resonator. Therefore it would be more accurate to characterize interaction of resonators by a continuous function of forced-oscillation frequency k(f) rather than set of constants k_p where p is order number of the resonance. It is obvious that the function k(f) must meet the condition k(f)_{f=f_p}=k_p. (9) Besides, the function k(f) must become zero at those frequencies f_z where transmission of high frequency power from one resonator to another one is absent, i.e. must meet the second condition k(f)_{f=f_z}=0. (10) The transmission zero arises in particularly in resonant circuits with mixed inductive-capacitive coupling when L_m>0. Its frequency k(f) is expressed by formula Tyurnev, V.V. (2002) \\"The coupling coefficients of an asymmetric pair of microwave resonators\\", Journal of communications technology and electronics, Vol. 47, No. 1, P. 1‚Äì8. f_z=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{L_m}{(L_1L_2-L_m^2)C_m}}.(11) The definition of the function k(f) that generalizes formula (6) and meets the conditions (9) and (10) was stated on energy-based approach in. This function is expressed by formula (8) through frequency-dependent inductive and capacitive coupling coefficients k_L(f) and k_C(f) defined by formulas k_L(f)=\\\\frac{\\\\dot{W}_{12L}(f)}{\\\\sqrt{[\\\\bar{W}_{11L}(f)+\\\\bar{W}_{11C}(f)][\\\\bar{W}_{22L}(f)+\\\\bar{W}_{22C}(f)]}}, (12) k_C(f)=\\\\frac{\\\\dot{W}_{12C}(f)}{\\\\sqrt{[\\\\bar{W}_{11L}(f)+\\\\bar{W}_{11C}(f)][\\\\bar{W}_{22L}(f)+\\\\bar{W}_{22C}(f)]}}. (13) Here W denotes energy of high frequency electromagnetic field stored by both resonators. Bar over W denotes static component of high frequency energy, and dot denotes amplitude of oscillating component of high frequency energy. Subscript L denotes magnetic part of high frequency energy, and subscript C denotes electric part of high frequency energy. Subscripts 11, 12 and 22 denote parts of stored energy that are proportional to U_1^2, U_1U_2 and U_2^2 where U_1 is complex amplitude of high frequency voltage at the first resonator port and U_2 is complex amplitude of voltage at the second resonator port. Explicit functions of the frequency-dependent inductive and capacitive couplings for pair of coupled resonant circuits obtained from (12) and (13) have forms k_L(f)=\\\\frac{L_m}{\\\\sqrt{L_1L_2}}\\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{(1+f_1^{-2}f^2)(1+f_2^{-2}f^2)}}, (14) k_C(f)=\\\\frac{-C_m}{\\\\sqrt{(C_1+C_m)(C_2+C_m)}}\\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{(1+f_1^2f^{-2})(1+f_2^2f^{-2})}} (15) where f_1, f_2 are resonant frequencies of the first and the second circuit disturbed by couplings. It is seen that values of these functions at f=f_1=f_2 coincide with constants k_L and k_C defined by formulas (14) and (15). Besides, function k(f) computed by formulae (8), (14) and (15) becomes zero at f_z defined by formula (11).  Coupling coefficients in filter theory  = Bandpass filters with inline coupling topology = Theory of microwave narrow-band bandpass filters that have Chebyshev frequency response is stated in monograph. In these filters the resonant frequencies of all the resonators are tuned to the passband center frequency f_0. Every resonator is coupled with two neighbor resonators at most. Each of two edge resonators is coupled with one neighbor resonator and one of two filter ports. Such the topology of resonator couplings is called inline one. There is only one path of microwave power transmission from the input port to the output port in filters with inline coupling topology. Derivation of approximate formulas for the values of the coupling coefficients of neighbor resonators in filters with inline coupling topology k_{i,i+1} those meet specified filter frequency response is given in. Here i and i+1 are order numbers of the coupled resonators in the filter. The formulae were derived using low-pass prototype filters as well as formulae (2) and (3). Frequency response of the low-pass prototype filters is characterized by Chebyshev function of the first kind. The formulas were first published in.Cohn, S.B. (1957) \\"Direct-coupled-resonator filter\\", Proc. IRE, Vol. 45, No. 2, P. 187‚Äì196. They have a form k_{i,i+1}=\\\\frac{f_2-f_1}{\\\\sqrt{f_1f_2g_ig_{i+1}}}, (16) where g_i (i=0,1,2...n) are normalized prototype element values, n is order of the Chebyshev function which is equal to the number of the resonators, f_1, f_2 are the band-edge frequencies. Prototype element values g_i for a specified bandpass of the filter are computed by formulas g_0=1, g_1=2a_1/\\\\gamma, g_i=\\\\frac{4a_{i-1}a_i}{b_{i-1}g_{i-1}}, (i=2,3,...n), (17) g_{n+1}=1, if n is even, g_{n+1}=\\\\mathrm{coth}^2(\\\\beta/4), if n is odd. Here the next notations were used \\\\beta=2\\\\mathrm{artanh}\\\\sqrt{10^{-\\\\Delta L/10}}, \\\\gamma=\\\\mathrm{sh}(\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{2n}), (18) a_i=\\\\mathrm{sin}\\\\frac{(2i-1)\\\\pi}{2n}, b_i=\\\\gamma^2+\\\\mathrm{sin}^2(\\\\frac{i\\\\pi}{n}), (i=1,2,...n), where \\\\Delta L is the required passband ripple in dB. Formulas (16) are approximate not only because of the approximate definitions (2) and (3) for coupling coefficients were used. Exact expressions for the coupling coefficients in prototype filter were obtained in. However both former and refined formulae remain approximate in designing practical filters. The accuracy depends on both filter structure and resonator structure. The accuracy improves when the fractional bandwidth narrows. Inaccuracy of formulas (16) and their refined version is caused by the frequency dispersion of the coupling coefficients that may varies in a great degree for different structures of resonators and filters. In other words, the optimal values of the coupling coefficients k_{i,i+1} at frequency f_0 depend on both specifications of the required passband and values of the derivatives dk_{i,i+1}/df_{f=f_0}. That means the exact values of the coefficients k_{i,i+1} ensuring the required passband can not be known beforehand. They may be established only after filter optimization. Therefore, the formulas (16) may be used to determine initial values of the coupling coefficients before optimization of the filter. The approximate formulas (16) allow also to ascertain a number of universal regularities concerning filters with inline coupling topology. For example, widening of current filter passband requires approximately proportional increment of all the coupling coefficients k_{i,i+1}. The coefficients k_{i,i+1} are symmetrical with respect to the central resonator or the central pair of resonators even in filters having unequal characteristic impedances of transmission lines in the input and output ports. Value of the coefficient k_{i,i+1} monotonically decreases with moving from the external pairs of resonators to the central pair. Real microwave filters with inline coupling topology as opposed to their prototypes may have transmission zeroes in stopbands.Belyaev, B.A., Leksikov, A.A., Tyurnev, V.V. (2004) \\"Frequency-selective features of multisection filters based on regular microstrip resonators\\", Journal of communications technology and electronics, Vol. 49, No. 11, P. 1228‚Äì1236. Transmission zeroes considerably improve filter selectivity. One of the reasons why zeroes arise is frequency dispersion of coupling coefficients k_{i,i+1} for one or more pairs of resonators expressing in their vanishing at frequencies of transmission zeroes.Belyaev, B.A., Tyurnev, V.V. (1992) \\"Frequency-dependent coupling coefficients of microstrip resonators\\", Elektronnaya Tekhnika. Ser. SVCh-tekhnika, Issue 4(448), P. 23‚Äì27, (in Russian). = Bandpass filters with cross couplings = In order to generate transmission zeroes in stopbands for the purpose to improve filter selectivity, a number of supplementary couplings besides the nearest couplings are often made in the filters. They are called cross couplings. These couplings bring to foundation of several wave paths from the input port to the output port. Amplitudes of waves transmitted through different paths may compensate themselves at some separate frequencies while summing at the output port. Such the compensation results in transmission zeroes. In filters with cross couplings, it is convenient to characterize all filter couplings as a whole using a coupling matrix \\\\mathbf M of dimension n\\\\times n,.Cameron, R.J., Kudsia, C.M., Mansour, R.R. \\"Microwave filters for communication systems: fundamentals, design, and applications\\", Hoboken, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., (2007) 771 p. It is symmetrical. Every its off-diagonal element M_{ij} is the coupling coefficient of ith and jth resonators k_{ij}. Every diagonal element M_{ii} is the normalized susceptance of the ith resonator. All diagonal elements M_{ii} in a tuned filter are equal to zero because a susceptance vanishes at the resonant frequency. Important merit of the matrix \\\\mathbf M is the fact that it allows to directly compute the frequency response of the equivalent network having the inductively coupled resonant circuits,. Therefore it is convenient to use this matrix when designing the cross-coupled filters. The coupling matrices \\\\mathbf M, in particular, are used as coarse models of filters. Utilization of a coarse model allows to quicken filter optimization manyfold because of computation of the frequency response for the coarse model does not consume CPU time with respect to computation for the real filter.  Coupling Coefficient in terms of the Vector Fields  Because the coupling coefficient is a function of both the mutual inductance and capacitance, it can also be expressed in terms of the vector fields \\\\mathbf E and \\\\mathbf H . Hong proposed that the coupling coefficient is the sum of the normalized overlap integrals J. S.

(22) Formulae (19) and (22) are approximate. They match the exact formula (8) only in case of a week coupling. Formulae (20) and (21) in contrast to formulas (12) and (13) are approximate too because they do not describe a frequency dispersion which may often manifest itself in a form of transmission zeros in frequency response of a multi-resonator bandpass filter. Using Lagrange‚Äôs equation of motion, it was demonstrated that the interaction between two split-ring resonators, which form a meta-dimer, depends on the difference between the two terms. In this case, the coupled energy was expressed in terms of the surface charge and current densities. Recently, based on Energy Coupled Mode Theory (ECMT), a coupled mode formalism in the form of an eigenvalue problem, it was shown that the coupling coefficient is indeed the difference between the magnetic and electric components \\\\kappa_M and \\\\kappa_E Using the Poynting theorem in its microscopic form, it was shown that \\\\kappa can be expressed in terms of the interaction energy between the resonators‚Äô modes.

Design and development Just before World War I the term Pfeilflieger was used to describe a category of biplanes with swept back wings, a feature adopted to provide some automatic stability. At least six other manufacturers (Ago, DFW, Harlan, Lohner Daimler, Sommer and Union) as well as LFG designed and built them, though some had less sweep than others. Most had Pfeilflieger in their name. The LFG Arrow was amongst the more strongly swept of the class. It had wings of unequal span, with ailerons only on the overhung upper planes. There was marked dihedral on the lower wing but none on the upper. With three pairs of long interplane struts on each side, the LFG was a three bay biplane with a large interplane gap. It could be powered either by a Mercedes D.I water cooled six cylinder inline engine or by a four-cylinder inline Argus As I engine of the same output. The Argus engined version had a span reduced by , 81% of the wing area and a slightly longer fuselage. The fuselage was flat sided and rectangular in section, with the engine exposed in the nose and the passenger/observer's cockpit immediately behind it. In some engine installations the radiator was mounted along the fuselage side, with this cockpit between them. The pilot's cockpit, fitted like the passenger's with a celluloid windscreen, was much further aft at about mid-fuselage with the main fuel tank between them.

Accessed June 9, 2016. Wallpack Center is located in the Flat Brook Valley west of Branchville. Wallpack Center has a post office with ZIP code 07881. Wallpack Center was established as a farming community in the mid-1800s. The community, which is located in a rural area, functioned as a service center for the surrounding farms. Due to its isolated location, the community only served farmers within its valley, which could not easily go to other communities for services. In the 1900s, the community declined as larger settlements were able to serve the farms in the region. . The community presently includes the post office, a church, a former school used for storage, and six houses. These buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Wallpack Center Historic District.

Life Lane was the son of a poor drawing-master from Worcester. Aged 14 he was apprenticed in London to John Barrow of Weston Place, St. Pancras, an artist and colourer of prints. Lane first came into notice as a painter of water- colour portraits and miniatures. About 1825 he took up oil painting. He was left-handed, but with the help of Alexander George Fraser became proficient. Lane died in an accident: while waiting for a friend at the horse repository in Gray's Inn Road he by mistake stepped upon a skylight, and, falling on the pavement below, was killed, 21 May 1828. He was buried in Old St. Pancras church-yard. Works The Gallery - Powerful Attraction of Talent by Theodore Lane Lane exhibited water-colours and miniatures at the Royal Academy in 1819, 1820, and 1826. He had a talent for humorous subjects, and a series of thirty- six designs by him, entitled The Life of an Actor, with letterpress by Pierce Egan, was published in 1825. Lane also etched some prints of sporting and social life: Masquerade at the Argyll Rooms, Scientific Pursuits, or Hobby Horse Races to the Temple of Fame, and A Trip to Ascot Races, a series of scenes on the road from Hyde Park Corner to Ascot Heath, which he dedicated to the king, 1827. He illustrated with etchings and woodcuts A Complete Panorama of the Sporting World, and Egan's Anecdotes of the Turf, 1827. In 1827 Lane sent to the Academy The Christmas Present, and to the British Institution An Hour before the Duel. In 1828 his Disturbed by the Nightmare was exhibited at the Academy, Reading the Fifth Act of the Manuscript at the British Institution, and The Enthusiast at the Suffolk Street Gallery. Enthusiast ('The Gouty Angler') by Theodore Lane, Tate collection Lane left a widow and three children, for whose benefit his best-known work, The Enthusiast, representing a gouty angler fishing in a tub of water, was engraved by Robert Graves; it was subsequently purchased by Robert Vernon, was engraved by Henry Beckwith for the Art Journal in 1850, and went to the National Gallery, ending in the Tate collection.tate.org.uk, Enthusiast ('The Gouty Angler'). His picture Mathematical Abstraction, which he left unfinished, was completed by Fraser, and purchased by John Rushout, 2nd Baron Northwick; it also was engraved by Graves.

She spent most of her career in the Mediterranean. She was lost to a mine in the Aegean Sea in 1943. Construction Hurworth was ordered with 15 others of the same type on 20 December 1939 as part of the War Emergency Programme. The ship was laid down by Vickers-Armstrongs on the River Tyne at Wallsend on 10 April 1940 in a yard big enough for two ships to be built at the same time. Her 'partner' was . Hurworth, as Admiralty Job No. J4207, was launched on 16 April 1941, and commissioned on 5 November. Hurworths complement was found in Portsmouth; her skipper and 'Jimmy' (first lieutenant), were both experienced officers. The 'workup' period was intense, with both ship and crew being tested to the limit. She eventually left the Tyne for Scapa Flow, calling at Rosyth where she was commissioned; she arrived at the 'Flow' on the 8th. Service history =From Scotland to Suez= Hurworths first operation involved taking Crown Prince Olaf of Norway from Scapa Flow to Scrabster in northern mainland Scotland. She then escorted the troopship Rangitata, with her fellow destroyer to Gibraltar, from the Clyde; arriving at the 'Rock' on 1 December 1941. Rangitata was shepherded to Freetown by Hurworth and two more destroyers, and . They were joined by another destroyer, on 18 December and arrived in the West African port in time for Christmas. Having carried out more escort work between Freetown and Cape Town in South Africa, Hurworth then sailed independently to Suez, becoming part of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla in Alexandria on 6 February 1942. =The Mediterranean= Convoy escort and invasion support Hurworth was kept busy throughout the year escorting merchant ships to Tobruk and Malta against stiff Axis aerial opposition. She also provided fire support at Mersa Matruh in August 1942. She then escorted the merchantmen - the 'empties', once they had discharged their cargoes, on the return journey to Alexandria. She was also involved with other Royal Navy ships and aircraft of the Royal Air Force in the action against a Kriegsmarine U-Boat, , on 30 October. In November, Hurworth, along with nine other ships, sailed as part of Operation Stoneage, escorting Convoy MW 13 to Malta. Somewhat surprisingly, the ships arrived at the beleaguered island without loss on 19 November. The return voyage to Alexandria saw several air attacks which were unsuccessful. Hurworth took part in other convoy escort operations in December, mostly to Malta; although one, MW 16, was to the newly recaptured port of Benghazi. The vagaries of war were driven home in the New Year rather dramatically with the death in February of Lieutenant Amos Stuart DSC in a car accident. In May 1943 Hurworth was involved in Operation Retribution, the prevention of enemy troops escaping from Tunisia and Algeria to Sicily and Italy. The plan seemed to have worked; Axis forces surrendered in North Africa on 13 May; many prisoners were taken. By now a member of the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla, Hurworth was due to support Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily, but boiler problems caused her to put into Malta for repairs. When she did arrive in the invasion area, she provided fire support and patrols off the British ACID beach. =The tide turns= The Italian capitulation did not mean the tempo slackened off. One crew member was quoted as writing to his mother about \\"having 4 hours off the ship in as many weeks\\". The convoy escort jobs continued; Hurworth was not involved in the Salerno landings, but she was present at Malta when the Italian fleet, including two battleships, two cruisers and a destroyer arrived, following their surrender. =The Aegean= The ship returned to escort duties until 15 September, when she, along with , crammed 300 infantrymen aboard for passage from Haifa to Portolago, on Leros in an attempt at thwarting German efforts to garrison the Greek islands following their evacuation by the Italians. More tragedy came along; following a gunfire support operation against Kos on 19 October 1943, Hurworth was hit by return fire. One man was killed. =Loss= Hurworth left Alexandria on 21 October 1943 as part of the supply force in the Dodecanese islands. The following day, with the ships just off the neutral Turkish coast prior to the 'dash' to Leros, the Greek destroyer Adrias struck a mine and was badly damaged. Hurworth, on going to investigate, suffered the same fate, but the explosion split the ship in two. Both halves sank within 15 minutes. 113 men died, there were 85 survivors. =Aftermath= Hurworth lies in of water at 36.59N 27.06E in Greek territorial waters; she is a War Grave.

In c.1250, the spelling was \\"Chirche Couele\\" and in 1316 \\"Church Couele\\", then \\"Churchcovell\\". The road was created between Church Cowley and Iffley Turn in 1853. It was previously known as Cemetery Road or New Road and was named \\"Church Cowley Road\\" in 1930. Location The road is mainly residential. It has a church (the Parish Church of St James and the Apostle) and graveyard (Rose Hill Cemetery). It separates the area of Florence Park from Cowley and Littlemore. House prices here are around average for the city of Oxford. Notable residents The comedian Ronnie Barker lived in the road as a boy from the age of four, when his family moved there, and a blue plaque by the Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board commemorates this.

Coconuts falling from their tree and striking individuals can cause serious injury to the back, neck, shoulders and head; and are occasionally fatal. Following a 1984 study on \\"Injuries Due to Falling Coconuts\\", exaggerated claims spread concerning the number of deaths by falling coconuts. Falling coconuts, according to urban legend, kill a few people a year. This legend gained momentum after the 2002 work of a noted expert on shark attacks was characterized as saying that falling coconuts kill 150 people each year worldwide. This statistic has often been contrasted with the number of shark- caused deaths per year, which is around five. Concern about the risk of fatality due to falling coconuts led local officials in Queensland, Australia to remove coconut trees from beaches in 2002. One newspaper dubbed coconuts \\"the killer fruit.\\" Historical reports of actual death by coconut nonetheless date back to the 1770s. Background Ber. Deutschen Bot. Ges., vol 51 pp. 301‚Äì304. (article translated into English by Dr. R. Child, Director, Coconut Research Scheme, Lunuwila, Sri Lanka).) Coconut fruit come from the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) which can grow up to tall, with pinnate leaf long, and pinnae 60‚Äì90 cm long. Older leaves will break away cleanly from the tree leaving a smooth trunk.T. Pradeepkumar, B. Sumajyothibhaskar, and K.N. Satheesan. (2008). Management of Horticultural Crops (Horticulture Science Series Vol.11, 2nd of 2 Parts). New India Publishing. pp. 539‚Äì587. . While a mature and thriving tree can yield up to 75 fruits per year, it is more common to get fewer than 30.Grimwood 1975, p. 18. A full-sized coconut weighs about .Bourke, R. Michael and Tracy Harwood (Eds.). (2009). Food and Agriculture in Papua New Guinea. Australian National University. p. 327. . Coconut palms are cultivated in more than 80 countries of the world, with a total nut production of 61 million tonnes per year.Food And Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Economic And Social Department. Statistics Division. (2 September 2010). Retrieved 14 April 2011 from the FAOSTAT Database. The origin of the death by coconut legend was a 1984 research paper by Dr. Peter Barss, titled \\"Injuries Due to Falling Coconuts,: published in the Journal of Trauma (now known as the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery). In his paper, Barss observed that in Papua New Guinea (where he was based), over a period of four years, 2.5% of trauma admissions were for those injured by falling coconuts. None were fatal, but he mentioned two anecdotal reports of deaths, one several years before. That figure of two deaths went on to be misquoted as 150 worldwide, which was based on the assumption that other places would suffer a similar rate of falling coconut deaths. In March 2012, Barss received an \\"Ig Nobel Award\\" from the Annals of Improbable Research in recognition of research that \\"cannot or should not be replicated.\\" In response to the dubious distinction, Barss told the Canadian Medical Association Journal, \\"when you're treating these injuries daily, it's not funny at all.\\" Following the publication of Barss' study, exaggerated claims about the number of deaths by coconut began to spread. Reports of death by coconut became so widespread that The Straight Dope, a newspaper column devoted to exposing myths, reported that it had become an urban legend. Another writer, Joel Best, described the claim of widespread deaths as a \\"journalistic equivalent of a contemporary legend.\\" An analysis by the Shark Research Institute cites a press release from Club Travel, a U.K.-based travel insurance company, as helping to spread the urban legend. In an attempt to market travel insurance to individuals traveling to Papua New Guinea, the release stated that coconuts were \\"ten times more dangerous than sharks\\". In May 2002, the legend gained new momentum when George H. Burgess, director of the International Shark Attack File, claimed that \\"[f]alling coconuts kill 150 people worldwide each year.\\" Concerns about death by coconut have been reported extensively in mainstream media sources. Such reports include: * In February 1985, The New York Times reported on the hazards posed by coconut trees and noted that \\"falling coconuts could strike a person on the ground with a force of almost 2,000 pounds [].\\" * In August 2001, the Toledo Blade reported that \\"a check with the experts\\" found that a human was more likely to be killed by a pig or a falling coconut than by \\"a shark on the prowl for dinner.\\" * In February 2002, The Daily Telegraph reported that coconut trees were being removed from beaches in Queensland, Australia, to guard against \\"death by coconut.\\" * In April 2002, the Boston Herald ran an op-ed piece titled \\"Travelers should watch out for coconuts ‚Äì the killer fruit.\\" The piece reported on the removal of palm trees bearing coconuts in Queensland and noted that local officials were \\"advising campers not to pitch their tents under coconut trees.\\" * In June 2002, The New York Times reported Burgess' claim that \\"the chances of being killed by a shark are less than those of being killed by a coconut that falls from a tree.\\" * In March 2003, The Morning Call in Pennsylvania reported, \\"You are 30 times more likely to be killed by a falling coconut than by a shark.\\" * In July 2005, Richard Roeper in the Chicago Sun-Times cited a 2001 report from the London Times for the proposition that, \\"You're more likely to be killed by a falling coconut than a shark.\\" * In February 2009, CBS News reported: \\"You have a better chance of being killed by a falling coconut than by a shark.\\" * Following shark sightings off the Massachusetts coast, The Boston Globe in September 2009 quoted a local resident as saying, \\"You're less likely to get killed by a shark than by a coconut falling on your head.\\" * In November 2010, The Guardian reported that the Indian government removed coconuts from the trees at Mumbai's Gandhi museum \\"for fear that a nut would descend on to the head of President Obama\\" who had recently visited the city. The article cited the Barss study and observed: \\"Thanks to Indian officials and perhaps also to Barss, Obama's recent visit to Mumbai was devoid of coconut trauma.\\" * In October 2011, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation broadcast a story in which Christopher Neff from the University of Sydney claimed that \\"while people may not pay attention to the statistics, you are more likely to be killed by a coconut than eaten by a shark.\\" A later 2001 study over a five year period found all skull fractures from falling fruit were in children under the age of ten. Documented occurrences =Death by falling coconut= Coconuts on tree near Canc√∫n, Mexico Documented instances of death by coconut include the following: * In approximately 1777, King Tetui of Mangaia in the Cook Islands had a concubine who died after being struck by \\"a falling green nut\\" * In 1833, four people died from falling coconuts on the island of Sri Lanka * In January 1943, a U.S. Marine was killed in his sleep when struck in the head by a falling coconut near Henderson Field on Guadalcanal * On 26 August 1952, a seven-month-old baby died when she was struck in the head by a coconut while being held by her mother in Singapore * In 1966, a resident of Rabaul, Papua New Guinea, was killed while eating lunch beneath a coconut tree when struck in the face by a falling coconut * In July 1973, a two-year-old girl was killed, and her aunt injured, during a family picnic at Kapiolani Beach Center near Diamond Head, Hawaii, when a cluster of 57 coconuts weighing more than 100 pounds fell from a tree. The incident was \\"Hawaii's first recorded fatality from falling coconuts.\\" * In November 1991, a mourner was killed by a falling coconut while attending a funeral at a cemetery in southern Sri Lanka * In April 2001, a resident of Vanuatu was killed by a falling coconut while seeking shelter from adverse weather conditions relating to Cyclone Sose * On 15 August 2001, in Kampung Tanjung Badang, Malaysia, Mamat Kundur, age 59, was killed when a monkey used to harvest coconuts from trees dropped a coconut on his head * On 1 August 2002, in Raub, Pahang, Malaysia, 6-month-old Nurul Emilia Zulaika Nasaruddin, died after a coconut fell into the child's crib and struck the child * On 22 September 2003, in Raub, Pahang, Malaysia, Deraman Ghomat, 65, was waiting to catch a bus, the wind became stronger and it started to rain just before a coconut fell * In March 2009, 48-year-old Luelit Janchoom, in Nakhon Si Thammarat Province of Thailand, was killed when a monkey used to harvest coconuts furiously kicked them down to his master, hitting his head * In May 2010, a one-and-a-half-month-old girl was killed when a falling coconut struck her in the head during a religious ceremony outside the family's home in Thiruvananthapuram, India * In August 2010, a 69-year-old man was killed by a coconut that fell out of a palm tree as he sat in a rocking chair outside his home in Melgar, Colombia * In 2013, a man in Colombo, Sri Lanka, was killed after a coconut fell on his head =Variations= While the typical form of death by coconut is by trauma resulting from a coconut falling from a tree under the force of gravity, variations on the phenomenon have also been reported. In December 1923, a New Castle, Pennsylvania man was killed while trying to crack open a coconut with the butt end of a loaded revolver. The gun discharged, and the man was shot in the abdomen. One of the most unusual variations occurred in India in the 1930s. Newspapers across the world reported that a schoolboy in India had been killed by a \\"magic\\" or \\"enchanted\\" coconut. In an effort to determine who had taken a book from a classroom, an elementary school teacher at Harnahalli required each of his students to touch a coconut bearing a namam, a religious symbol. The teacher claimed that the one who took the book would face \\"divine wrath\\" upon touching the coconut. One student resisted, but was forced to touch the coconut. He reportedly contracted a high fever, fell into delirium, and died within an hour. In April 1983, a coconut was cited as the cause of death for a female goose-beaked whale. The husk from a coconut became lodged in its intestine, and the whale beached itself on a sandbar at Siesta Key, Florida. In May 1997, a report of death by coconut oil was published. The production line manager at a margarine factory in Kyiv, Ukraine, drowned in a vat of coconut oil. His body was discovered soon after he was reported as missing. The police investigated to determine whether he fell or was pushed into the coconut oil. Other occurrences involve coconuts being used as deadly weapons. These include: * In 1944, reports were published that Japanese troops were using \\"coconut bombs\\" in defending against the American invasion of Leyte. Col. Allan Feldman reported that the bombs were created by placing hand grenades and picric acid inside hollowed-out coconuts. The coconuts were then sealed with wax, attached to a string, and thrown at the American troops. * In July 2004, a 55-year-old Sri Lankan man was killed when he was struck on the head by a coconut. Police concluded that the blow was not the result of a coconut falling from a tree, but rather had been sustained in a fight that developed after the victim invited \\"a group of friends to his hut to enjoy a hooch party.\\" There have also been reports of deaths resulting from the collapse of coconut palm trees. These include: * In April 1992, an 81-year-old man was killed in Malaysia when he was pinned under the trunk of a coconut tree that had been uprooted by high winds. His family noted that he had been employed as a \\"coconut plucker\\" and had previously survived a fall from a coconut tree. * In May 2006, a man and a boy were killed by falling coconut palm trees during a tropical storm in the Philippines. * In August 2011, a 56-year-old man was killed after an entire coconut tree toppled onto him while he was motorcycling in Kampung Baru Seberang Takir, Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia. * In August 2020, a 37-year-old man died of severe head injuries after a coconut tree he was hired to help cut down fell on him. The incident occurred in a roadside gully near Banana Beach, along the coastal road from Surin to Nai Thon, Thailand.https://www.thephuketnews.com/man-killed-by-coconut-tree-76921.php Other reports credit the strength of the coconut palm trees with saving the lives of persons who have been tied to the trees for safety during high wind or tsunami events.(report on a Kutubdia Island man who lost six family members to a cyclone but saved one son by tying him to a coconut tree)(\\"Stories are told of how during cyclones people in Kiribati would tie themselves to coconut trees so they would not be blown into the ocean.\\")(report of man saving his family from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami by tying them to a coconut tree) Coconuts and the law Deaths and injuries resulting from falling coconuts have been the subject of several legal proceedings that have been covered in the media. In 1956, the City of Miami paid $300 to a woman after a coconut fell from a city-owned tree and struck her in the foot. In justifying the award, the city attorney explained that the city was allegedly on notice of the danger, because \\"a reasonable man would assume it was about to fall when it turns brown.\\" In 1977, a jury in Hawaii awarded $39,000 to a police officer who was struck by a falling coconut. The officer was hit in the head while removing fronds from a public sidewalk in Lahaina. The property owner was sued for failing to maintain the trees. Popular culture The American poet Frederick Seidel wrote a poem titled \\"Coconut\\", which included the following lines: On their 1995 CD Makin' A Mess, the writing/singing team of Bob Gibson and Shel Silverstein included a song on this subject, entitled \\"Killed By A Coconut\\", which humorously describes a series of men and their fatal encounters with coconuts. Falling coconut injuries were featured in the American television series Gilligan's Island. A June 1965 episode revolved around an injury sustained by Gilligan after a falling coconut hit him in the nose. Actor Bob Denver explained the success of the series as follows: \\"Little kids seem to love it. It doesn't take a great intellect or reasoning power to be able to laugh at a monkey running off with Gilligan's dinner or a guy getting conked on the head by a coconut.\\" When Denver died, the show's creator Sherwood Schwartz said that Denver didn't get enough credit for his talent as a slapstick actor: \\"A lot of people don't think it's hard to be an actor where all you have to do is react to a falling coconut.\\" In the film Cast Away, the stranded character played by Tom Hanks is alarmed several times by loud thuds, which he cannot identify. He finally sees a coconut fall, making the sound. In March 2006, Newsweek ran a satirical article on former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, stating he testified that he had sustained amnesia after being struck in the head by a falling coconut and, as a result of the injury, was unable to recall the events that occurred during his time at Enron. When Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones underwent surgery and hospitalization for a brain injury in April 2006, some press reports erroneously blamed the injury on Richards' having been \\"conked by coconuts\\". Falling coconuts had not caused the injury as Richards had climbed a dead tree (not a coconut palm) and had then fallen from the tree. The video game Donkey Kong 3 has the antagonist Donkey Kong throwing coconuts from overhead at the player, trying to kill him. A hit causes a missed turn. In the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \\"Rock-a-Bye Bivalve\\", Patrick Star is addicted to a show where nothing happens except a man gets hit in the head by a coconut. In the Sonic the Hedgehog video game series, several robotic enemies stylized after monkeys throw coconuts at Sonic the Hedgehog from the trees as he runs past.

In 893 of the Creation Calendar, the powerful but evil Sirens started the ‚ÄúGenesis Project‚Äù, attempting to create the most powerful and perfect life form in the world. In order to prevent the situation from getting out of hand, Adala formed an alliance, which destroyed everything the Sirens had possessed and expelled the remnants. However, the war tore a mysterious accidental rift in space, from which powerful demons emerged continuously. The rift also corroded the nearby forests, which mutated woodland creatures into horrible and cruel beasts. More and more powerful monsters came into existence, with the most advanced able to rip through thousands of warriors instantly. After an emergency conference, Adala decided to assemble the elites of all races and form an organization to especially hunt those beasts. They are called the ‚ÄúRift Hunters‚Äù.

Life Born at Manchester on 26 November 1808, he was the son of Thomas Stephenson, boot and shoe maker, of Stable Street there, near Oldham Street. He was educated at a school kept by Thomas Rain, adjoining Oldham Street chapel, and before the end of his schooldays was apprenticed to John Fothergill, an engraver, of Prince's Court, Market Street. While there he met Henry Liverseege, and, perhaps on his advice, went to London at the end of his apprenticeship and entered the studio of William Finden. While there he gained the silver medal of the Society of Arts for an original design of a figure engraved in line. About 1838 Stephenson returned to Manchester and established himself as an historical and landscape engraver in Ridgefield, and then in a studio in St. Ann Street. Around 1847 he moved back permanently to London, and from 1856 exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy. He died at his residence in Dartmouth Park Road, London, on 28 May 1886. Works Stephenson furnished illustrations for Manchester as it is (1839), for Charles Swain's Mind and other Poems, and for other books; and engraved the members' card for the Anti-Corn-law League. For Agnew & Sons he painted portraits of prominent members of the League, including Sir John Bowring, Edward Baines, and John Heyworth. During this period he also engraved Charles Allen Du Val's portrait of Richard Cobden, George Putten's portrait of John Frederick Foster, and John Boston's portrait of Daniel Grant, one of the original \\"Cheeryble Brothers\\". In 1842, for the British Association, which met in that year in Manchester, he executed a portrait of John Dalton. John Dalton, by James Stephenson Among Stephenson's later engravings were The Great Day of His Wrath, The Last Judgment, and The Plains of Heaven, after John Martin; The Highland Whiskey Still, the Taming of the Shrew, and The Queen at Osborne, after Edwin Landseer; Ophelia, after John Everett Millais; and the Portrait of Lord Tennyson, after George Frederick Watts.

At the same time, recent efforts were made to study the gradual change from Halaf style pottery to Ubaid style pottery in various parts of North Mesopotamia. Archaeology Archaeologically the period has been studied anew recently by a number of scholars. The Halaf appears to have ended around 5200 BC and the northern Ubaid begins around then. There are several sites that run from the Halaf until the Ubaid. Previously, only two such sites were well known. The first of these, Tepe Gawra, was excavated in the 1930s when stratigraphic controls were lacking, causing difficulties in re-creating the sequence.Campbell, Stuart and Fletcher, Alexandra. 2010.

But with the present state of archaeological knowledge, more certainty is emerging. Sites with abrupt transition Tell Arpachiyah, and Tepe Gawra are the sites where the transition from Halaf to Ubaid were quite abrupt. No transitional levels were observed at these two important sites.SIMONE M√úHL and OLIVIER P. NIEUWENHUYSE (2016), Halaf and Ubaid period settlement: a view from the Central Zagros Piedmont. in: M.

L. Perkins identified the existence of a Halaf-Ubaid Transition phase that can be seen in ceramic assemblages.

Its benefice is united with that of St Mary, West Derby. The church is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building. History The church was designed by Edward Welch and built in 1845‚Äì46. The original short chancel was replaced by a larger one by W. and J. Hay in 1875‚Äì76, and at the same time a south organ chamber, a north vestry, and a semicircular structure to the south of the tower, providing a staircase to the tower and new steps to the gallery, were added. Originally the church has a slim broach spire, but this became unsafe, and was demolished and replaced by a low pyramidal roof in 1970. In 1994 the interior of the church was re-ordered, the pews were removed, and a wall was inserted to form a parish hall at the rear. Architecture =Exterior= St James' is orientated north-south; in the following description ritual orientation is used. The church is built in red sandstone. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave, north and south transepts, a chancel with a north chapel and a south vestry, and a west tower with a baptistry to the south. The tower is in three stages, with a west doorway, lancet windows, louvred bell openings, and a pyramidal roof. There are more lancet windows along the sides of the church, and a five lancets at the east end. In the roof are dormers. =Interior= Inside the church the former west gallery is now in the parish hall. Most of the stained glass was designed by Carl Almquist, E. H. Jewitt and W. J. Tipping, all of the Lancaster firm Shrigley and Hunt, with the glass in the lancet windows at the east end, dated 1876, by William Wailes. The three-manual pipe organ was built in 1869‚Äì70 by William Hill and Son. Originally in the west gallery, it was moved to the chancel in 1876, and it was rebuilt and enlarged, again by William Hill, in 1895. There is a ring of six bells, all cast in 1859 by George Mears at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry.

Career history Neill, who was born with dwarfism, was initially more interested in equestrian sports, but after an injury to her competition horse, and a lack of funds, she began looking for other sporting outlets. Neill had always been interested in athletics, and had entered the 2009 World Dwarf Games in Belfast, where she had won three medals in throwing events, but she now decided to take the sport more seriously. In 2010 Neill entered several meets, including the Sport Grand Prix in Perivale, the UK National Open Dwarf Games in Birmingham and the London Disability Athletics Challenge, competing in the discus, javelin and shot put. She also entered the IWAS World Junior Championships in Olomouc in the Czech Republic. At the Junior Championship, Neill took bronze in the javelin and discus and gold in the shot put. In 2011 Neill dropped the javelin throw to concentrate on her other two events. She again entered the IWAS World Junior Championships, this time held in Dubai. There she took silver in the discus and retained her shot put title. 2011 also saw Neill enter the Paralympic World Cup in Manchester where she came fourth in the shot. Although not part of Team GB in the 2012 Summer Paralympics, Neill was selected for the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships in Lyon, selected in the discus.

The company was established in 1864. It is based in Bridgwater, Somerset.  History  The company was founded by William Gadsby in Stratford, London, in the year 1864. The business sold wicker items from a shop in Gurney Road. During World War Two the original shop was bombed, and the company chose to relocate to the Somerset Levels. This location was chosen due to the prevalence of willow growth in the area, a low lying wetland region. During World War Two the company was employed by the Ministry of Defence to produce airborne panniers, large wicker baskets that were filled with supplies and munitions and dropped to troops by plane. The company opened a new store in Somerset, near the village of Burrowbridge at the side of the A361 road. During the 1970s much passing trade was lost as a result of the creation of the new M5 Motorway. In 1988 the company was the subject of a documentary by Transition Vision. Willow focused on the willow industry on the Somerset Levels, covering areas such as cultivation and basket making. Until the mid-1990s the business was predominantly a producer of large baskets for use as picnic hampers and employed around 25 weavers. Many of these hampers were used in new cars, such as those sold by Rolls-Royce.  Flooding problems and a shift to importing  Due to the low nature of the Somerset Levels, with much of the area at or below sea level, the business was regularly damaged by winter flooding. When exposed to water the wicker products became mouldy and had to be discarded on a number of occasions. This resulted in the movement of the business to a new facility near Bridgwater in 2002. A 1996 article in the UK Financial Times examined the history of the business, as well as the shift to imported goods at that time. It also covered the issue of flooding and its effects upon the business. By 1996, W Gadsby & Son were importing around 100,000 willow hampers each year, the majority of which were from Eastern Europe. The worst flood to affect the company came during the winter of 1995, when a large amount of stock was lost during flooding that covered the Somerset Levels. Although willow thrives under wet conditions, the stock became contaminated when exposed to flood water and could not be sold.  The company today  Since 2002 the company has occupied a site adjacent to the M5 Motorway in Bridgwater. This facility serves as the main warehousing and logistical hub for the company. The company is now managed by Paul Gadsby, a 5th generation family member. The business assists annually with the nearby North Petherton Carnival, offering parking for the charity event. Due to increasing labour costs the majority of sales now consist of imported items, with one weaver still used to produce English-made samples and bespoke items. The customer base of W Gadsby & Son Ltd includes companies such as Harrods.> Much of its recent and current product development is focused on retail display, as well as gift packaging products.

He was the son and heir of the Sassanid Persian general and briefly shahanshah, Shahrbaraz. Biography Niketas was the son of Shahrbaraz, a famous Persian general who had led Sassanid armies in Syria, Anatolia, and Egypt during the Byzantine‚ÄìSassanid War of 602‚Äì628. After the war ended, Shahrbaraz remained in control of Egypt and the Levant lands, until in early 629 he handed them back to the Byzantine emperor Heraclius in exchange for Byzantine support in his own bid for the Persian throne. To conclude the pact, Niketas, who was recognized as Shahrbaraz' heir by Heraclius, was given the Byzantine rank of patrikios, while his sister Nike was married to Theodosios, one of Heraclius' sons.Kaegi (2003), pp. 152, 188 Niketas and another of his brothers came to live in the Byzantine court, practically as hostages. As a token of their alliance, in summer/early autumn 629, Niketas returned the Christian relics of the Holy Sponge and the Holy Lance to Heraclius from Jerusalem, then still under control of Shahrbaraz's Persian troops. It is probable that at this time, Niketas converted to Christianity; as he was his father's heir-apparent, this opened the prospect of the Christianization of Persia should Shahrbaraz be able to maintain his power there.Kaegi (2003), pp. 188‚Äì189, 206 Following his father's murder, Niketas remained in Byzantine service, and re-appears in 636 as one of the many Byzantine commanders during the Battle of Yarmouk against the Muslim Arabs, although which army he led is unknown. He survived the Byzantine defeat at Yarmouk and fled to Emesa, from where he contacted the Caliph Umar.

Doheny after he had made a huge oil strike in Mexico. Pan American profited from fuel demand during World War I, and from the subsequent growth in use of automobiles. For several years Pan American was the largest American oil company, with holdings in the United States, Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela. In 1924 Pan American was involved in the Teapot Dome scandal over irregularities in the award of a U.S. government oil concession. Standard Oil of Indiana obtained a majority stake in 1925. The company sold its foreign properties to Standard Oil of New Jersey in 1932. What was left of Pan American was merged with Standard Oil of Indiana in 1954 to form Amoco. Origins Edward L. Doheny was a prospector who became wealthy in the 1880s from silver mines in the Black Range of New Mexico. In 1892 he moved with his family to Los Angeles, where he sank a mine and found oil at the corner of Patton Street and West State Street. This began an oil boom in Los Angeles. Doheny overextended himself and his company went bankrupt in August 1896. The setback was temporary, and a long-term contract with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway gave him the opportunity to develop and expand a growing number of oil properties. In 1900 he visited Mexico with his associate Charles A. Canfield and Almon Porter Maginnis of the Santa Fe railroad, saw the oil potential of the country near Tampico, Tamaulipas and began acquiring property. Doheny found heavy oil in El Ebano in 1901, which he exported to the United States for use in paving. He formed the Mexican Petroleum Company and funded it with $6 million of his own money. In 1905 he bought properties near Tuxpan, Veracruz, and formed the Huasteca Petroleum company to hold them. In 1910 his wells in the Juan Casiano Basin in the Faja de Oro field started to produce good quality oil. The gusher at Casiano number 7 spewed out 60,000 barrels a day, and by 1918 had delivered over 85 million barrels of oil. In 1911 Doheny signed a contract to supply Standard Oil. Doheny's Mexican Petroleum Company made a major strike in February 1916 with the Cerro Azul No. 4 well in Cerro Azul, Veracruz, Mexico. When the well struck it shot a stream of oil into the air. It became world's largest, pumping 260,000 barrels per day. Over the next fourteen years the well produced over 57 million barrels. The Mexican Petroleum Company eventually acquired ownership or leasehold rights to of land. Expansion The Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company was incorporated by Doheny in Delaware in 1916 as the holding company for his Mexican Petroleum Company, Huasteca Petroleum Company and California oil properties. World War I drove up demand for oil-fueled transport, and Doheny responded by expanding pumps, tanks and loading sites in Tampico. By July 1917 Pan American had a fleet of 31 tankers. The company paid $1.1 million in dividends in 1917 and $3.1 million in dividends on its common stock in 1918. 1918 revenues were $17 million and net profits were almost $7 million. In 1918 the Carib Syndicate, a concern owned by Americans, bought the Barco oil concession in Colombia. They sold 75% of their interest to the Colombian Petroleum Company the next year, a subsidiary of Pan American. Doheny was also interested in plans to develop the oil industry in Venezuela, and in building a pipeline from Colombia to Venezuela to make it more economical to export the Barco oil production from the west coast of Lake Maracaibo. In 1921 Pan American was the largest oil company in the United States, ahead of Sinclair Consolidated Oil Corporation and the Standard Oil Company of Indiana. Automobile production was booming and oil prices were high. The Mexican Petroleum Company was the largest in Mexico, and Mexico was the largest oil producer in the world. Edward L. Doheny poses with his lawyer Frank J. Hogan in this 1924 photo In 1922 Albert B. Fall, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, leased the oil field at Elk Hills, California, to the Pan American Petroleum & Transport Company. Around the same time, the Teapot Dome Field in Wyoming was leased to Sinclair Consolidated Oil Corporation. Both oilfields were part of the US Navy's petroleum reserves. Neither lease was subject to competitive bidding. In 1924 rumors about corruption in the deals escalated into the Teapot Dome scandal. On 24 January 1924 Doheny testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Public Lands and Surveys, and admitted that he had loaned Fall $100,000 in cash with no security some months before the oilfield leasing arrangement was made. Doheny said the loan was a personal one. Pan American had been the lowest bidder for a contract to build and fill crude oil storage facilities at Pearl Harbor, and had offered to undertake this contract in exchange for the oilfield lease, being paid in oil and then paying royalties to the government for oil extracted in excess of costs. Eventually the Supreme Court nullified both leases. It was not until 1930 that Doheny was cleared of all charges. In 1923 Louis Blaustein and his son Jacob Blaustein sold a half interest in their American Oil Company to Pan American in exchange for a guaranteed supply of oil. Before this deal, American Oil had depended on Standard Oil of New Jersey, a competitor, for its supplies. At the end of 1923 Pan American had a net worth of $173 million, with net earnings that year of over $20 million. The company paid dividends of $20.4 million that year. Amoco subsidiary On 1 April 1925 the California assets of Pan American Petroleum and Transport were transferred to a new holding company, the Pan American Western Petroleum Company, in which Doheny retained control. He sold a majority of shares in the remainder of the Venezuelan facilities of Pan American Petroleum and Transport and his Mexican Petroleum Company to Pan American Eastern Petroleum, a new subsidiary of Standard Oil of Indiana. This included the Mexican holdings, Atlantic and Gulf Coasts holdings in the United States, refineries, pipelines and 31 tankers. At the end of 1925 Pan American Western gained control of Lago Petroleum Corporation from C. Ledyard Blair's Blair & Co.. The transaction was to be the subject of a stockholder action in 1933, alleging that there had been a conspiracy by the bankers, who were represented on the Pan American board, to make excessive profits. In 1926 Venezuelan Eastern Petroleum Corporation was organized as a subsidiary of Pan American Eastern with the purpose of buying and developing Venezuelan oil properties. The Turkish Petroleum Company discovered a large oil field in Iraq in 1928. France, the United Kingdom, and the United States were each worried about being edged out by the other two. The Red Line Agreement gave the Near East Development Corporation, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Royal Dutch Shell, and the Compagnie Fran√ßaise des P√©troles each 23.75% of any oil that was produced by the Turkish Petroleum Company. The Near East Development Corporation (NEDC) represented American interests and included Jersey Standard Oil, Socony-Vacuum Oil Company, Gulf Oil, the Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company, and Atlantic Refining. The remaining 5% share went to an Armenian businessman, Calouste Gulbenkian, who had previously owned shares within TPC. Pan American sold out its shares in NEDC to Jersey Standard and Socony (later Mobil) in 1930. In 1932 Pan American sold its foreign properties to Standard Oil of New Jersey for about $100 million. With this acquisition, Standard Oil of New Jersey became Mexico's largest oil producer. The deal also included large oil concessions in Venezuela and Pan-American's UK subsidiary Cleveland Petroleum Products. However, a few years later the Mexican properties were nationalized. President L√°zaro C√°rdenas expropriated all foreign oil concessions on 18 March 1938 and placed them under the government-controlled Pemex, paying compensation to the former owners. In the 1940s the case of Blaustein v. Pan American Petroleum & Oil Transport Co. was heard by the Supreme Court to determine whether the directors of Pan American had been in breach of their fiduciary duty. The directors were all officers of directors of Standard Oil of Indiana, which held almost 80% of Pan American's shares, and it was charged that they had deprived Pan American of profitable opportunities to drill and refine oil. The majority finding, setting an important precedent, was that it should be assumed that they had acted in good faith and without personal gains to themselves. In 1954 Pan American merged with Standard of Indiana to form the American Oil Company, Amoco. Amoco was in turn acquired by British Petroleum in 1998. In popular culture The novel Oil! by Upton Sinclair published in 1927 is loosely based on Doheney's life and the story of Pan American. Oil! was in turn the inspiration for the 2007 film There Will Be Blood.

The extension from Santiago de Compostela to Vigo completed in March 2015 and the entire line was inaugurated on 18 April 2015. The total investment of the project exceeded ‚Ç¨3bn. The line was planned to be extended to the south towards the border between Spain and Portugal and with a further connection to the city of Porto including the longest railway bridge on the Iberian Peninsula for the 4.5 km crossing of the Minho River. It was also planned to be extended to the north from A Coru√±a to Ferrol. However, these plans were shelved in 2011.  Features  The line has a length of 155.6 km of Iberian gauge track of , which is due to be converted to Standard gauge once the Madrid-Ourense-Santiago de Compostela high speed line is fully operational. It is an upgrade of the former 241 km non electrified single railway line between the town of Ferrol and the Portuguese border into a double electrified high- speed line for the part between A Coru√±a and Vigo. The new rebuilt railway permits mixed use traffic with a maximum design speed of 250 km/h for passenger trains. The new line has 37 tunnels totalling 59.2 km, 38% of the total length and the longest is the 8.25 km tunnel beneath Vigo which connects the line with the new Vigo-Urzaiz station. It also has 32 major bridges, including a 2.4 km viaduct across the valley of the River Sar. The new line shorten the distance between A Coru√±a and Vigo by 22 km, from 178 km to 156 km, and cut the travel time from around 3 hours on the old railway down to 1 hour and 20 minutes on the new one. The line is linked to the Madrid‚ÄìGalicia high-speed rail line in Santiago de Compostela, which as of 2019 is under construction.

By birth, she was a princess of Moghulistan as a daughter of Qazan Khan ibn Yasaur and was also a direct descendant of Genghis Khan. Family and lineage Saray Mulk Khanum was born a princess of Moghulistan in 1341 to Qazan Khan ibn Yasaur, the last Khan of the Chagatai Khanate. Saray's grandfather was Khan Yasa'ur, her father's predecessor and a great-great-grandson of Chagatai Khan. She was therefore, a direct descendant of Genghis Khan, the Great Khan (Emperor) and founder of the Mongol Empire. Saray was thus, a member of the House of Borjigin, the most renowned family clan in Eurasia. Being the daughter of a Khan, Saray held the title of Khanum (\\"daughter of a Khan or princess\\") by birth. Marriage to Timur Siege of Balkh (1370) Before her marriage to Timur, Saray had been previously married to her husband's predecessor, Amir Husayn of Balkh. When in 1370, Timur defeated and thereafter executed Husayn after the Siege of Balkh, he seized the harem of his predecessor and took to himself the latter's wives, one of whom was Saray Mulk Khanum, daughter of Khan Qazan and a Turko-Mongol princess. Saray was five years younger than Timur and was said to be very beautiful, sometimes described as possessing \\"surpassing\\" beauty. As the daughter of a Khan and a descendant of Genghis Khan, Saray enjoyed the status of Timur's senior wife, although in her first husband's harem the chief wife was a daughter of Khan Tarmashirin, who after Husayn's fall was married to the Jalayir Khan Bahram. Through his marriage to Saray, Timur acquired the right to the surname Gurgan (\\"son-in-law\\") of Qazan Khan, which appears on his coins and often in the Mamluk sources. The title of gurgan was very important for Timur because it was indicative of his relations with the family of the Chughtai. In 1397, Timur married Tukal-Khanum, a daughter of the Mongol Khan Khizr Khoja, who skipped over several other wives due to her exalted lineage and took the second place in the harem becoming second in status only to Saray. Saray, therefore, held the position of being Timur's chief consort until his death. Little is known of Saray and Timur's relationship, apart from the fact that she was his confidante and one of his closest advisers, but it is clear that she wielded great influence over her husband and in the Empire. She is also cited by most sources to have been Timur's \\"favourite\\" and his beloved wife. Saray also sometimes acted as regent during Timur's absences from Samarkand as a result of his western campaigns and wielded great authority at Court. As Timur's chief consort, Saray additionally held the title of \\"Great Empress\\" similar to the title held by Genghis Khan's chief wife, B√∂rte. The Spanish ambassador, Ruy Gonz√°les de Clavijo, who was sent by Henry III of Castile to visit Timur's court in 1405, called Saray, \\"The Grand Khanum\\". In May 1394, Saray along with Timur's other wives followed her husband with the ughruq to Armenia and Transcaucasia where Ibrahim was born. In September, they returned to Sultaniya, but some time later were again summoned to join Timur. In the spring of 1395, both the Saray and Tukal with the children were sent to Samarkand, where Shahrukh had been staying since the autumn of 1394. In 1396, they were all in Khuzar, meeting Timur on his return from his \\"Five Years\\" campaign. During the Indian campaign, Saray Mulk Khanum and Ulugh accompanied Timur only as far as Kabul. In August 1398, Timur sent them back to Samarkand from the neighbourhood of Kabul. =Issue= Saray did not have any children with Timur, though she is sometimes referred to as the mother of her husband's youngest son, Shahrukh Mirza, who was actually born of a concubine. Even if Saray had any children with her husband, they did not survive, and neither did Tukal-Khanum's, and yet their power and influence were well noted by foreign visitors to the Court. It was the two Chingisid princesses' personal qualities and pedigree that allowed them to develop a such a prestigious dynastic position, since with Timurid consorts maternity was not in itself a path to power. Upon the birth of Shahrukh's eldest son, Ulugh Beg, in 1394, he was also, like his father, placed in Saray's care and grew up under the supervision of the Empress. Clavijo's account of the Empress Ruy Gonz√°lez de Clavijo, the Spanish ambassador who was sent by Henry III of Castile to the Timurid imperial court at Samarkand Although the Spanish ambassador, Ruy Gonz√°les de Clavijo, probably did not intend it, his description of \\"Cano\\" (The Great Khanum), Timur's chief wife, as she entered the great pavilion serves as a potent metaphor for much that he witnessed during his sojourn in Samarkand, the capital of Timurid Empire, between 8 September and 20 November 1404. As the ambassador of Henry III of Castile, Clavijo enjoyed great generous access to the life and ceremony of the Timurid imperial court and left one of the most detailed and lengthy accounts of their settings. \\"Cano\\" identifiable as Empress Saray, had come to join her husband, Timur, for a great feast, one of the several arranged at the Khan-i-Gil (lit. Mine of clay) meadow located outside Samarkand.Brummett, p. 113 Clavijo offers an expanded description of Saray's procession into the pavilion and of what she was wearing. Joined by fifteen servants to carry her train, eunuchs, and a male servant carrying a \\"shade\\" (sombra), Saray Mulk Khanum was dressed in red silk, her face covered by a white veil. She wore a complex headdress, fashioned from red fabric ornamented with pearls, rubies, turquoise, feathers, and held together with gold wire.Brummett, p. 114 Clavijo estimated about 300 hundred attendants making up her royal suite. Her doubly screened face ‚Äî one screen a cloth veil, the other a thick layer of applied make-up ‚Äî concealed her true identity. The face that dimly showed beneath her veil was so thickly covered with white lead to protect from the Sun, that it looked as if it were made of paper. Patronizing education The Bibi Khanym Mosque in Samarkand was named after Saray by her husband One of the most important buildings of the late 14th century in Samarkand was the Khanum madrasa, opposite the great mosque of Timur. The madrasa was commissioned by Empress Saray in c. 1397 as she was interested in patronizing education and was built by her orders at the capital of the Timurid Empire: Samarkand. Saray had commissioned many other buildings, but only the Khanum madrasa foundations remains to this day. Timur named one of the largest mosques ever conducted (1399-1404) in honour of his wife, Bibi Khanum (Saray). However, the Bibi Khanym Mosque was actually commissied by Saray.

The actor previously auditioned for guest roles on the show, but the producers decided to develop a long-term character specifically for him instead. Glockner's character, Mason, was created and introduced along with the Turner family, as part of a major overhaul of the show's cast. Glockner was given a two-year contract with Neighbours and he began filming his first scenes as Mason in November 2012. Glockner made his first screen appearance as Mason during the episode broadcast on 22 February 2013. In December 2013, it was announced that Glockner was to leave Neighbours and Mason departed on 28 February 2014. The character was introduced two weeks after his parents and two younger siblings. Prior to his on-screen arrival, Mason was serving a three-month sentence for robbery in juvenile detention. He had fallen in with a bad crowd and was led astray by Robbo Slade (Aaron Jakubenko). Executive producer, Richard Jasek, said Mason has a good heart, while Glockner described him as being \\"smart, funny, serious, angry, caring, playful\\" and someone who loves his family. Shortly after his arrival, Mason developed a relationship with Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer). He also became involved in another robbery with Robbo and briefly dated Imogen Willis (Ariel Kaplan). Creation and casting On 4 November 2012, it was announced that the five-strong Turner family would be introduced to Neighbours in February 2013. The family were created as part of a major overhaul of the show's cast. Of the Turners, Kate Kendall, who plays matriarch Lauren, explained \\"The producers were looking to get quite a traditional family in there and hark back to some of those old traditions and family values. They're going to be a really charismatic family, but you'll also get some really juicy storylines and that's what the audiences relate to. Viewers will relate to the familiarity of them and hopefully the sense of magnetism that we bring.\\" The Turners were given an immediate link in Erinsborough through long-term resident Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver), the father of Lauren and grandfather to Mason and his siblings. Taylor Glockner was cast as the eldest Turner sibling Mason. Speaking to Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy, Glockner explained that he had previously auditioned for a couple of guest roles on the show. The producers decided that they wanted to develop a long-term character specifically for Glockner instead. The actor called the creation of Mason \\"a very interesting process.\\" Glockner was both \\"humbled and thrilled\\" to land the role and called it \\"a fantastic opportunity\\" for him as an actor. He told Brooke Hunter from Femail \\"One of my inspirations, Guy Pearce worked on Neighbours and that was one of my big reasons for auditioning and working hard on the project.\\" Glockner initially had a two-year contract with Neighbours and he began filming his first scenes in November 2012. He shot his first scenes alongside actress Ashleigh Brewer who plays Kate Ramsay. Glockner made his debut screen appearance as Mason on 22 February 2013, two weeks after the rest of his on-screen family began appearing. Development =Backstory= In his fictional backstory, Mason was born in June 1999. His birth date was changed to 15 February 1995 upon his introduction. Mason arrived in Erinsborough two weeks after his family due to being in juvenile detention, where he was serving a three-month sentence. Glockner revealed that Mason had fallen in with a bad crowd back in Mount Isa, where his family are from, and was led astray by \\"troublemaker\\" Robbo Slade (Aaron Jakubenko). Robbo developed a plan to rob a local warehouse, which Mason went along with ‚Äì but it went wrong. While Robbo escaped, Mason was caught and the arresting officer was his father Matt (Josef Brown). =Characterisation= Before his introduction, Kendall described Mason as \\"the smouldering, rebellious\\" child. While executive producer, Richard Jasek, commented that Mason is \\"a bad boy\\", who has a good heart. He has done the wrong things for the right reasons. Similar to Jasek, Glockner thought that Mason may not have made the best choices in life, but they always came from the right place. Glockner thought that it was \\"kinda cool\\" that Mason arrived after his family, saying that it was in his nature to be late to the party. He also said his character was \\"a good kid\\" deep down. Describing Mason, the actor stated \\"He's just lost his way a little bit recently and he's faced the consequences. At the end of the day, he loves his family and would do ANYTHING to protect them. He's smart, funny, serious, angry, caring, playful... and his cheekiness is particularly fun to play.\\" The actor told Kilkelly that he loves Mason's \\"hard, rebellious edge\\", saying it was a part of him. He continued \\"It often works playing Mason with that chiselled element, because it really accentuates his moments of pain and vulnerability.\\" Glocker also labelled his character \\"a lost puppy\\" and \\"impulsive\\". The actor stated that despite trying to be a better person, trouble often seemed to follow Mason. Relations between Mason and his father are \\"pretty icy\\" to begin with. Mason does not have a lot of time for Matt as he still blamed him for sending him to juvenile detention. Glockner commented that Mason also felt \\"a lot of frustration and resentment\\" towards his father, but thought he would overcome it and forgive Matt eventually. Glockner told an Inside Soap columnist that Mason was happy to be free and saw Erinsborough as an unexplored playground. Mason is quick to settle in and when he realises he needs a job, he asks Chris Pappas (James Mason) who works at the local garage. Chris is initially reluctant to take him on, but when Mason helps him out with Ralphie Mahone (Daniel Bowden), Chris then owes him a favour. =Relationship with Kate Ramsay= Shortly after his arrival, Mason began pursuing Kate Ramsay (Brewer) and although she thought he was too young, there was a spark between them. Glockner said Mason and Kate were a great match and he thought that Kate might be the type of woman to help Mason get his life in order. Mason tries everything to impress Kate, including taking his shirt off in front of her. But when he tries \\"a more heartfelt approach\\" by compiling a CD of Kate's sister's music to give to her, it prompts Kate to invite him to Georgia Brooks's (Saskia Hampele) birthday party as her guest. However, just as Kate is starting to change her mind about Mason, his ex-girlfriend, Rhiannon Bates (Teressa Liane), shows up in town. Rhiannon's presence is not welcomed by Mason, but he ends up kissing her to get information about Robbo. Glockner told TV Week's Thomas Mitchell that Mason is prepared to go as far as he needs to, but Kate is the girl he has genuine feelings for. Kate witnesses Mason and Rhiannon's kiss and Mason fears his relationship with her is over before it has begun. Despite resisting Mason's advances at first, Kate becomes jealous when she sees him with Rhiannon. Brewer admitted that she was not sure her character should be with Mason, especially after she had previously been involved with someone younger. She explained \\"But it's different, he's very cheeky and it takes its time. Rhiannon turns up and Kate is like 'Why am I getting jealous?' And that's when it starts to unravel that maybe she really does like this guy. But he's really fun and opposites attract there and she just dives in.\\" Kate and Mason begin dating, but soon after, Kate's ex- boyfriend, Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor), returns and asks Kate to come away with him. Kate had assumed Mark was dead, so when she begins spending time with him, Mason feels left out of Kate's life. He is threatened by the history between Kate and Mark and eventually he and Mark fight. Kate is left torn between Mark and Mason, but she eventually commits to a relationship with Mason. However, Mason feels like second best and when he learns Kate kissed Mark, he breaks up with her. Glockner told an Inside Soap columnist that Mason was \\"shattered\\" over his break up with Kate and even though he put on a front, he was struggling inside. Mason tries to get over Kate by dating new neighbour Imogen Willis (Ariel Kaplan). Glockner insisted that Imogen was just a distraction for Mason and even though he thinks she is \\"a pretty cool girl\\", it becomes clear that Mason is not over Kate. Imogen quickly realises Mason still has feelings for Kate and she calls time on their brief relationship. Mason decides to forgive Kate for kissing Mark and he tries to reconcile with her. They kiss, but Kate pushes Mason away and flees. Glockner explained \\"When Kate runs out on him, Mason is confused. At the end of the day he still loves Kate and wants her back.\\" Mason is unaware that Kate recently had a one-night stand with her housemate Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan) and Glockner reckoned that Mason would not take it lightly when he found out, adding that it would interesting to see how he harnesses his \\"explosive temper.\\" =Robbo and Lassiter's robbery= Mason's past catches up with him when Robbo Slade arrives in Erinsborough. A writer for Inside Soap observed that Mason was \\"not too pleased\\" to see Robbo, considering that he left Mason to take the blame for the robbery they both committed in Mount Isa. Robbo reveals that he has tracked Mason down to get his share of the proceeds from the robbery. Robbo's arrival brings Mason and Matt closer as they realise that they have more important things to worry about and need to work together to protect the family. Since Mason no longer has the money from the Mount Isa robbery, he is forced to come up with another way to pay Robbo back. Mason also learns that Robbo has been secretly dating his younger sister Amber (Jenna Rosenow). Robbo informs Mason that unless he comes up with his share of the money, he will continue to see Amber. Mason's desperation to get Robbo out of town leads him to agree to rob Lassiter's Hotel with him. Mason \\"listens in horror\\" as Robbo outlines his plan to rob the hotel while everyone attends Sonya Mitchell (Eve Morey) and Toadfish Rebecchi's (Ryan Moloney) wedding reception. Mason is aware that his criminal record means that he cannot afford to be caught up in anything illegal, but he believes that he has no choice but to go along with Robbo's plan to protect his family. Mason and Robbo's attempted armed robbery does not go according to plan and they are spotted by Sonya. However, she loses her memory during an explosion, leaving Mason to believe that he is in the clear. But when Sonya's memories return weeks later, Mason is arrested and told that he could go to prison for 15 years if he is convicted. Mason is \\"heartened\\" by Kate's forgiveness, but her uncle, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis), disapproves of their relationship and asks his lawyer to represent Mason and deliberately damage his case, so he will be sent to jail. Mason is surprised by the offer and Glockner commented \\"Paul doesn't exactly like Mason, so Mason's taken aback when Paul offers to help.\\" Paul's plan is rumbled by Mason's father, Toadie and Ajay Kapoor (Sachin Joab), who move quickly to stop it. On 13 May 2013, it was confirmed that Jakubenko had returned to filming, after pictures of him filming with Glockner were released on the show's Facebook page. When Robbo returns, Mason calls the police and tells them that Robbo was responsible for the attempted robbery at Lassiter's. Mason later attempts to deal with Robbo using his fists, but Robbo outsmarts him when he reveals that he has an \\"illicit video\\" of Amber that will go viral, unless Mason gives him double the amount of money he owes him. Glockner said that Mason is distressed by the situation and knows that if the video got out, the ramifications would impact on Amber for the rest of her life. Mason becomes so desperate to get hold of the money, he turns to Paul for help, which is \\"a hard thing\\" for him to do. He also tries breaking into the old radio station, where Robbo is squatting, to try to find the video and delete it. Glockner thought that Mason would not rest until he had put a stop to Robbo's plan and commented \\"Mason's a total hothead and often acts before he thinks. But would he do something to Robbo that could have permanent consequences. We'll just have to wait and see...\\" =Departure= On 3 December 2013, it was announced that Glockner was to leave Neighbours. The actor stated that since Mason's introduction, he had been \\"the catalyst for a remarkable amount of storyline\\" and after a discussion with the producers, they all felt the character should be rested. Glockner continued \\"I've been involved in so much high-intensity story in such a short space of time ‚Äì coming up just shy of a thousand scenes in one year!\\" Glockner told a TV Week reporter that he needed a creative rest, but did not rule out a return to Neighbours. The actor added that he had had \\"the time of my life.\\" In January 2014, a reporter for news.com.au stated Mason would leave to pursue a new job. Glockner's last scenes as Mason were broadcast on 28 February 2014. Storylines After being released from juvenile detention early, Mason waits a couple of weeks before joining his family in Erinsborough. When he arrives, Mason reassures his mother that he has changed his ways, but tells his father that he will not forgive him for helping to send him to juvie. Mason's brother, Bailey (Calen Mackenzie), admits that he found $10,000 from the robbery, which he was also involved in. When the brothers go to retrieve the money, hidden in a garden gnome, they find it has gone. Mason intervenes when he sees Ralphie Mahone threatening Chris Pappas and begins flirting with Kate Ramsay. He asks her out, but she turns him down due to his age. Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major) gives Mason a job at his garage, while Mason's grandfather, Lou, learns that he has been to juvie. Bailey suspects that Mason's accomplice, Robbo Slade, was behind a break in at their house and to prove him wrong, Mason contacts Robbo. He turns up in Erinsborough and asks for his share of the proceeds from the robbery. Mason soon learns that Robbo has been dating Amber and playing the family off against each other. Realising that he needs to get rid of Robbo quickly, Mason takes a waitering job at Lassiter's Hotel to earn more money. In order to square his debt with Robbo, Mason agrees to take part in a robbery at Lassiter's. However, on the day, extra security staff laid on for Sonya and Toadie's wedding prevent Mason and Robbo from carrying out the robbery. While Robbo is berating Mason, they are spotted by Sonya and Robbo leaves. Shortly after an explosion causes Sonya to hit her head and lose her memory. Bailey spots the missing gnome in Sheila Canning's (Colette Mann) garden and he and Mason try to get it back. They tell Sheila the money belongs to Lou and she gives it to him. When he learns where it came from, he donates it to charity. The truth about the Mount Isa robbery comes out and it brings Matt and Mason closer. Mason's ex-girlfriend, Rhiannon Bates, arrives in town and he uses her to get information about Robbo. Realising that Rhiannon's presence is stopping him from winning over Kate, Mason tells her that does not want to be with her. Kate's uncle, Paul Robinson, learns about Mason's criminal record and attempts to blackmail him into leaving her alone. However, Mason is honest with Kate and they start dating. Sonya regains her memory, leading Mason to be arrested and charged with armed robbery. Kate breaks up with him, but Mason gets her to change her mind. Paul disapproves of Mason dating Kate, but offers Mason his lawyer's services. Kate's ex-boyfriend, Mark Brennan, returns and Mason is jealous when she spends time with him. Mason finds out Mark has a girlfriend in Sydney and they fight. When Kate tells Mason that she chose him, he believe that he is second best and breaks up with her. Mason changes lawyers at the last minute and is given a three-year good behaviour bond. Mason briefly dates Imogen Willis, but she breaks up with him when she realises he still loves Kate. Mason asks Kate if they can get back together and she tells him that she had a one-night stand with Mark. Mason assures her that he can get past it and they reunite. Mason and Imogen become co-owners of a car and Mason gets a job as a concierge at Lassiter's. Robbo returns to Erinsborough and Mason tips off the police. After making bail, Robbo comes to see Mason and they fight. Mason supports Kate when she tells him that she is infertile, but he is disappointed when he learns her housemates knew first. Robbo blackmails Mason for $10,000, threatening to release footage of himself and Amber having sex onto the internet. After failing to raise enough money, Mason asks Paul for a loan, but Paul insists on handling things his way. Robbo steps up his threat, causing Mason to ask Chris, Joshua Willis (Harley Bonner) and Hudson Walsh (Remy Hii) for help. Hudson gets the money and the others are giving it to Robbo, Mason breaks into Robbo's squat and takes his laptop. That same night, Robbo is involved in a hit-and-run and he later dies in hospital.

The storyline sees Mason teaming up with Hope Gottlieb (Louna Maroun) in an attempt to stop a zombie invasion. Reception Of Mason's first appearance, Dianne Butler from The Daily Telegraph commented \\"And now boy Mason Turner's arrived, fresh out of juvie, and already he's hooking people up with 'storm-damaged' cars from 'Queensland'. Sure, we're all for rehabilitation, but there is a limit.\\" A reporter for the Daily Post also commented on Mason arrival, saying \\"Fresh out of juvenile detention, Mason turns up in Ramsay Street with a chip on his shoulder. He hasn't forgiven Matt for shopping him to the cops. Little wonder there's tension between father and son at a belated Turner family dinner to celebrate Mason's 18th birthday.\\" A writer for the Sunday Mail called Mason the \\"resident bad boy\\". Their colleague noted that Rhiannon's arrival halted Mason's attempts to get closer to Kate and said \\"How is he going to manage to up his game and show Kate that he's the one for her when his ex is lingering? Kissing her probably won't help, either.\\" A writer for the same paper wrote that Mason was not \\"having a good time\\" when he ended up on the wrong side of the law again. Another reporter thought \\"Mason's romantic life is also on the up, as he takes Imogen out on a date and the two seem to hit it off.\\" Peter Dyke and Katie Begley from the Daily Star cited Mason as one of the reasons extra female viewers were tuning into Neighbours. A TV Week columnist branded Imogen and Mason \\"a modern-day Romeo and Juliet.\\" References External links * Character profile at the Official AU Neighbours website Category:Neighbours characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2013 Category:Fictional thieves Category:Fictional mechanics Category:Fictional waiting staff Category:Male characters in television Category:Male villains ","title":"Mason Turner"},{"id":"40065870","text":"The Sangatta Coal Mine is a coal mine located in East Kalimantan.

To escape the resulting feeling of oppression, many of the youth in Zawame formed dance crews called Beat Riders to bring joy back into peoples' lives. Also rising in popularity is the Inves Game, a simulator that uses strange devices known as Lockseeds to summon monsters known as Inves. Kouta Kazuraba, a member of the dance group Team Gaim, tries to find his place in the world while torn between his loyalty to his teammates and his sister Akira's insistence that he starts acting like an adult and find a proper job. When Team Gaim's captain disappears after informing Kouta of a strange belt he found, Kouta discovers that the Lockseeds and Inves are from an alternate dimension known as Helheim Forest. Encountering a mysterious girl resembling his Team Gaim teammate and close friend Mai Takatsukasa, Kouta uses a Sengoku Driver belt and the Orange Lockseed to become a samurai-armored warrior that is later named Armored Rider Gaim. In the meantime, including Team Baron's leader Kaito Kumon as Armored Rider Baron and Kouta's Team Gaim teammate Mitsuzane Kureshima as Ryugen, other Armored Riders appear to amass social power throughout Zawame: Team Raid Wild's Ryoji Hase as Kurokage, Team Invitto's Hideyasu Jonouchi as Gridon, and the perfectionist ex-soldier Oren Pierre Alfonzo as Bravo. Unbeknownst to the Armored Riders, the Yggdrasill Corporation monitors them and the Inves Games while the head of its R&D; division, Mitsuzane's older brother Takatora, is the enigmatic white Armored Rider Zangetsu who is protecting a dark secret hidden within Helheim Forest. Eventually, when Kouta confronts Takatora as he becomes a New Generation Armored Rider alongside the Armored Rider development scientist Ryoma Sengoku as Duke, his aide Yoko Minato as Marika, and the Lockseed Dealer Sid as Sigurd, he learns the horrible truth of Helheim Forest: that it was home to a once prosperous civilization that was eradicated by the strange plants growing throughout it, as anyone who consumed the fruit of these plants is turned into an Inves. Finding an ally in DJ Sagara, a pirate radio DJ who knows more than he is letting on such as the intelligent Over Lord Inves, Kouta finds himself in the middle of a Sengoku period-like brawl among various factions for the right to possess the power of Helheim Forest‚Äìthe proverbial forbidden fruit itself‚Äìand the fate of life on Earth as he knows it. But while adamant to obtain the Golden Fruit to save the world, Kouta's goal involves him having a predestined confrontation with Kaito who desires the fruit's power to shatter the status quo of the world.

Discovery and naming The first specimen was collected by who described it as mandibular fragments of Protocetus sloani. described two new species, Andrewsiphius kutchensis and A. minor based on their previous material and new mandibular fragments. Later researchers interpreted the same mandibular specimens as belonging to Remintonocetus. reinterpreted these specimens as fragments from maxillae, and determined that the described \\"confluence of the mandibular canals anteriorly\\" was in fact the narial passages. Gingerich et al. also determined that the variations in size among proposed species were within the normal variation for a single species and therefore attributed a number of referred specimens as belonging to Andrewsiphius sloani. Gingerich et al. also noted that the type specimen of Kutchicetus minimus came from the same locality as A. sloani and that its distinctive small size was within the variation that could be expected for A. sloani, and Gingerich et al. therefore included K. minimus into A. sloani. Later authors, however, disagreed on this assignment and Kutchicetus is still accepted as a separate genus.. Retrieved July 2013. named the type species for Dr Robert E. Sloan, Department of Geology, University of Minnesota. Description Andrewsiphius is similar to but smaller than Kutchicetus (another remingtonocetid); synonymized them, and proposed a new subfamily, Andrewsiphiinae, for the two species. Later authors,E.g., however, still accept both as separate genera. Andrewsiphius and Kutchicetus share several characteristics not present in other remingtonocetids: an elongated snout that is higher than it is wide; foramina (small holes) on the tip of the snout suggesting the presence of whiskers; eyes located dorsally near the cranial midline, resulting in an appearance of a mammalian crocodile; and a very large sagittal crest overhanging the back of the skull. Other characteristics make them distinct: the second and third upper and lower premolars are double- rooted in Andrewsiphius but single-rooted in Kutchicetus; the large diastemata in the former are absent the latter; and the tail vertebrae are more robust in Andrewsiphius. Andrewsiphius is, compared to the remgintonocetids Remingtonocetus and Dalanistes, smaller, has a narrower rostrum, and smaller premolars separated by longer diastemata.

With papal approval and encouragement, King W≈Çadys≈Çaw I of Poland allied with Gediminas of Lithuania and organized the raid against Louis V of Germany. Pope John XXII opposed Louis' ambitions to become the Holy Roman Emperor, King W≈Çadys≈Çaw regarded Neumark (East Brandenburg) as Polish territory, while Lithuanians sought loot. The Teutonic Knights, under papal pressure, observed its peace treaties with Poland and Lithuania and did not interfere. The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian army raided Brandenburg for a month, reaching Frankfurt and Berlin, and took 6,000 prisoners. Background After the death of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor, in August 1313, a war erupted between cousins Louis V of Germany and Frederick the Fair of Austria for the imperial crown. Ambitious Pope John XXII saw himself as the ultimate judge and arbiter in the conflict. When Louis V ignored papal decrees and assumed full imperial authority, the pope excommunicated Louis and rallied European nobility against him. The Margraviate of Brandenburg was ruled by the House of Ascania, which became extinct with the deaths of Waldemar in 1319 and Henry II in 1320. The succession crisis caused a lot of confusion. Louis V considered the margraviate vacant and, after his victory in the Battle of M√ºhldorf, appointed his son also named Louis as Margrave of Brandenburg in 1323. That created a common border between possessions of Louis V and Polish King W≈Çadys≈Çaw I, who competed for influence in the Duchy of Silesia. The Poles also regarded Lubusz Land, which was incorporated into Neumark (East Brandenburg), as their territory. Thus, it did not take much encouragement from Pope John XXII to convince King W≈Çadys≈Çaw to attack Brandenburg. In late 1324 or early 1325, Gediminas of Lithuania concluded a military alliance with Poland primarily directed against the Teutonic Knights, a crusading military order. The alliance was cemented by the marriage of Gediminas' daughter Aldona and W≈Çadys≈Çaw's son Casimir. In 1322, Gediminas sent a letter to Pope John XXII with vague promises to convert to Christianity. Seeing a potential new ally, the Pope sent a delegation to Lithuania and by threat of excommunication compelled the Teutonic Knights, who supported Louis V of Germany, to make peace with Gediminas in August 1324. The peace remained in effect for four years until 1328. Raid On February 7, 1326, with the help of papal legates, W≈Çadys≈Çaw I concluded an armistice at ≈Åƒôczyca with the Teutonic Knights and three Masovian dukes which guaranteed safe passage for the Lithuanian troops through Prussia and Masovia while they were in \\"Polish service\\". The truce was to last to Christmas 1326 and, according to chronicler Detmar von L√ºbeck, papal legates even accompanied the army to ensure the Knights observed the armistice. On February 10, 1326, David of Hrodna led 1200 Lithuanian men to join the Polish forces. The joint army looted and robbed Frankfurt, Berlin, and surrounding territories. Thus, the pagans reached Central Europe and struck the Holy Roman Empire which shocked western rulers. Not meeting any organized resistance, they plundered churches and monasteries for about a month. Reportedly, they took 6,000 prisoners as slaves and much booty. The loot was large enough to allow Samogitian duke Margiris to pay 20,000 florins to King John of Bohemia when he raided Medvƒógalis in 1329. German chronicles, including Nikolaus von Jeroschin, vividly described atrocities committed by the invaders. They were particularly scandalized by pagan Lithuanians who showed no respect for Christian symbols, establishments, or personnel. Reportedly distraught by Lithuanian cruelty, Masurian nobleman Andrew Gost ambushed and killed David of Hrodna and their way back to Lithuania. Aftermath While the raid was a successful military campaign and bought much loot, it was not a political success. The raid further antagonized Poland and the Teutonic Knights. The tension soon turned into the Polish‚ÄìTeutonic War (1326‚Äì32). Silesian Piasts turned against Poland and recognized suzerainty of King John of Bohemia. The alliance between the Pope and the pagan Lithuanians, subjects of the Lithuanian Crusade, scandalized western rulers and damaged the Pope's reputation. In 1328, Louis succeeded in installing Antipope Nicholas V. The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian alliance, which survived to 1331, ruined the Lithuanian alliance with the Duchy of Masovia, which oscillated between Poland, Lithuania, and the Teutonic Knights in attempt to maintain its independence. Gediminas' hopes of creating a Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìHungarian alliance against the Teutonic‚ÄìBohemian alliance did not materialize. Instead, the raid encouraged John of Bohemia to join the Lithuanian Crusade and capture Medvƒógalis in 1329.

As one of two Catholic-majority countries in Asia (the other being Timor-Leste), the Philippines enjoys significant relations with the Holy See. The Holy See has a nunciature in Manila, and the Philippines has an embassy to the Holy See (Vatican City) based in Rome. History President Benigno Aquino III meets Pope Francis during his state visit to the Vatican in 2015 Pope Francis with President Benigno Aquino III during the Pope's visit to the Philippines, January 2015 Catholicism first arrived in the Philippines in the 16th century, with missionaries accompanying conquistadors as they annexed the islands to the Spanish Empire. By the time the Philippines regained sovereignty from the United States following the Second World War with the establishment of the Third Republic, Catholicism had already left a lasting impression on Philippine culture and society with at least seventy percent of Filipinos professing the faith. During the administration of Philippine President Elpidio Quirino, the Apostolic Delegation of the Philippines was upgraded to a Nunciature, with Archbishop Egidio Vagnozzi becoming the first Apostolic Nuncio on 9 April 1951. The first Philippine Ambassador to the Holy See, Dr Manuel Moran, presented his credentials to Pope Pius XII on 4 June 1951. Three popes thus far have made pastoral visits to the Philippines. Pope Paul VI visited the Philippines in 1970 and made a speech in front of students at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) in Manila. In 1981, Pope John Paul II also gave a speech at UST, and beatified the 17th century Manila native Lorenzo Ruiz a saint at Luneta Park, the first beatification made outside the Vatican. The pontiff later returned the Philippines in 1995 for the X World Youth Day. On January 15‚Äì19, 2015, Pope Francis made a papal visit to the Philippines, where gave a speech at UST and visited Tacloban, the city that was devastated by Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan). The Philippines has hosted the 1937 International Eucharistic Congress (IEC) in Manila and did so again from 25 to 31 January 2016, which was moved from the original May date per request of the Vatican. Archbishop of Cebu Jos√© S. Palma of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines suggested to the Vatican for Pope Francis to visit the country for the event. However, Palma later confirmed that the pontiff would not visit the country for the event and the Vatican would instead send a papal envoy to participate, saying: \\"the IEC is the opportunity to give glory to God.

Life and work Giuseppe Chiari was born in Florence, Italy on September 26, 1926. In Florence he devoted himself to studying piano and music composition in parallel with studies in mathematics and engineering (1946‚Äì51).Giuseppe Chiari in the dalla Enciclopedia Italiana He was especially drawn to the work of John Cage, and himself began to take an interest in promoting experimental research in visual music in 1961. In 1962, at the Fluxus Festspiele internationale Neuester Musik in Wiesbaden, he joined the Fluxus group, taking on the role of artist-composer-philosopher. Among his writings are: Music without counterpoint (1969), Untitled (1971), Mother Music (1973); Teatrino (1974) Art (1974), Method for playing (1976); Aesthetik (1984), Doubt harmony (1990) and Music (1994). Chiari made what he called \\"action music\\" based on a complex method of execution and traditional instruments: music that takes as its essential element random sounds (water, dry leaves, stones). His work ‚ÄúGiuocare con l'acqua e dire la parola acqua‚Äù (‚ÄúPlaying with water and saying the word water‚Äù) is quite remarkable for both the transformation of the pages of the script into an aesthetic object, and the clarity and rigour of the texts that preludes to the later production of statements typical of conceptual art.

CD94 contains a short cytoplasmic domain and it is responsible for signal transduction. Therefore NKG2 receptors form disulfide bonded heterodimers. NKG2D represent an exception, it is a homodimer.Lazetic S, Chang C, Houchins JP, Lanier LL, Phillips JH (1996), Human natural killer cell receptors involved in MHC class I recognition are disulfide-linked heterodimers of CD94 and NKG2 subunits.

Eur J Immunol. 28(2):444-50 that are defined by the sequence (I/L/V/S)xYxx(L/V), where ‚Äúx‚Äù means any amino acid at a given position. If ITIM-bearing receptors engage their ligand, probably Src family kinase phosphorylates tyrosine residue, and this allows recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, SHP-2 or SHIP. It leads to dephosphorylation of tyrosine kinase‚Äôs substrates, which are involved in the activating cascades. As a result, NK cell activation is suppressed.Lanier LL (2008), Up on the tightrope: natural killer cell activation and inhibition. Nat Immunol. 9(5):495-502 * NKG2C (encoded by the KLRC2 gene), NKG2E and NKG2H are activating receptors. Ligand binding enables interaction between receptor and ITAM-bearing adaptor protein DAP12 (ITAM, Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif, defined by the sequence (D/E)xxYxx(L/I)x6-8Yxx(L/I)). Src family kinases phosphorylate tyrosine in ITAM sequence. It results in recruitment of tyrosine kinases Syk and ZAP-70 by the adaptor molecules. Finally, actin cytoskeleton is being reorganized and the cell can release cytotolytic granules containing perforin and granzyme. This signaling pathway also induces transcription of many cytokine and chemokine genes. The process is similar to T and B cell signaling through their specific receptors TCR or BCR.Lanier LL (2008), Up on the tightrope: natural killer cell activation and inhibition. Nat Immunol. 9(5):495-502 * NKG2D is activating receptor as well but it couples with adaptor protein DAP10 which carries signaling motif YINM. Src or Jak kinases phosphorylate DAP10, which can then associate with p85 subunit of PI(3)K or adaptor molecule Grb2. This signaling triggers actin reorganization (cell polarization) and degranulation.Lanier LL (2008), Up on the tightrope: natural killer cell activation and inhibition. Nat Immunol. 9(5):495-502 * Function of NKG2F receptor has not been clarified yet.Huang H, Wang X, Zhang Y, Zheng X, Wei H, Sun R (2010), Up-regulation of NKG2F receptor, a functionally unknown killer receptor, of human natural killer cells by interleukin-2 and interleukin-15.

Annu Rev Immunol. 23:225-74 Nonclassical MHC glycoproteins class I are structurally similar to classical MHC class I molecules, but they present mainly peptides derived from the signal peptides of MHC class I. Therefore NK cells can indirectly monitor the expression of classical MHC class I molecules through the interaction of CD94/NKG2 with HLA-E (Qa-1) and HLA-E (Qa-1) themselves as well.Yokoyama WM, Plougastel BF (2003), Immune functions encoded by the natural killer gene complex.

The Straight Dope, a newspaper column devoted to exposing myths, reported that it \\"is one of the classic urban legends\\", however, there have been real life instances where babies have been roasted. Legend In some versions, the baby is accidentally cooked when miscommunication occurs. For example, \\"put the turkey in the oven and the baby in the bed\\" is wrongly heard as \\"put the baby in the oven and the turkey in the bed\\". Other variants set out that the doer of the deed was drug or alcohol-induced or an insane individual. In the end, the roasted baby is sometimes served as food to be consumed by the parents. The person who roasts the baby is usually a babysitter or the baby's sibling. Documented occurrences In real life, there have been documented occurrences of babies being roasted, though by family members instead of strange babysitters. When Virginian Elizabeth Renee Otte roasted her baby in 1999, the incident was cited as causing the legend to become true. In November 2006, a second case of real-life baby-roasting was reported. In May 2012, a British citizen was arrested by Thai police after being found in possession of six corpses of roasted infants, some wrapped in gold leaf, reportedly in conformity with a \\"black magic ritual\\". On November 16, 2015, a one-year old baby, J'Zyra Thompson, died after her three-year-old sibling put her in the oven and cooked her alive. Their mother, Racqual Thompson, left her four kids at home, which included a five-year-old and a two-year-old, when she went to pick up a pizza. When they returned home, Thompson found J'Zyra's body cooked in the oven. Thompson and her boyfriend of ten months, 21-year-old Cornell Malone, were charged with endangering a child. Thompson was then sentenced to 12 years in prison for abandoning a child under 15 years old. In March 2016, a 35-year-old mother in Texas showed up naked at her neighbor's door with her partially burned and naked 2-year-old daughter. When police arrived, she confessed that she had put the girl in the oven along with a cat she had recently shot dead, while making sexual advances toward an officer and singing praise to God. According to an affidavit from the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, she seemed unconcerned with her daughter while in hospital and jail, where she was charged with injury to a child with serious bodily injury and tested positive for alcohol, marijuana and methamphetamine. The girl was put in foster care.\\"Glen Rose mother was high before she put daughter in oven, officials say\\", by Claire Z. Cardona, Dallas News Crime Blog In popular culture In the 1979 blaxploitation film Avenging Disco Godfather, a PCP addict claims to have honey-roasted her baby for her family's Easter dinner, ostensibly so the baby's crying wouldn't spoil the occasion. In the thirteenth episode of Teen Girl Squad, released on June 18, 2007, the main cast of teenage girls is babysitting the infant Timkins. When What's-Her-Face attempts to drink a can of diet soda, So-And-So loudly objects and - citing a blatantly-labelled book of urban legends from health class - claims that drinking it will make her \\"microwave the baby!\\" What's-Her-Face is quick to correct her that the diet soda is not PCP. In August 2009, a joke advertisement showcasing a \\"body part roaster\\" \\"specially designed to roast infants and other human morsels\\" surfaced on the website of retailer Sears.com. The song 'Babysitter on Acid' by the all-female punk rock band, Lunachicks is a retelling of the Urban Legend. The teenage babysitter, under the influence of drugs, roasts the baby in the oven and tells the mother over the phone that \\"Wanna know how the baby is? / Don't worry, she's almost done\\". The song was released on their 1990 album Babysitters On Acid.

Etching and drypoint are labor-intensive processes and one of the early forms of printmaking. \\"Rembrandt (Rembrandt van Rijn): Christ Crucified between the Two Thieves: The Three Crosses\\" (41.1.31) In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000‚Äì. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/41.1.31. (October 2006) Rembrandt chose these media primarily because he often suffered financial hardship. He sold many of his etchings in order to be able to afford to print The Three Crosses. Rembrandt made around sixty impressions from the plate in its first three stages, the darkest shadows on the piece being done in dry point, and Christ and the lighter figures being etched. The nature of the media meant it was possible for Rembrandt to make continuous alterations (which he did over a ten-year period), adding further etching and dry point, changing the composition of the picture and making the final image darker and more chaotic. In the last stage, the Virgin Mary becomes an almost disembodied head surrounded by darkness.

It is an oil on panel painting completed in the year 1647. It depicts the story of Susanna, a Deuterocanonical text from the book of Daniel in the Bible. The painting is currently housed at the Gem√§ldegalerie in Berlin.  History  = Creation = When Rembrandt painted Susanna and the Elders, religious themes in art were not as common as in other parts of Europe, most such paintings coming from Rembrandt himself. This was due to the rise of Protestantism in Holland and a loss of favor for the Catholic traditions at the time. However, while Rembrandt studied many modern subjects for his work, he still continued to explore Biblical themes, despite their waning popularity. He initially based Susanna and the Elders on one of the same name by his teacher, Pieter Lastman. Rembrandt copied Lastman's painting in a drawing ca. 1636 as a study for his own work. The painting Rembrandt completed in 1647 however is notably different in composition than Lastman's except for some similarities in the background. While in Lastman's Susanna the figures all take more passive roles, Rembrandt's is an active scene, with an elder taking hold of Susanna while she twists her body to get away. Only the palace in the background echoes his mentor's work. Shortly after Rembrandt completed the piece in 1647, it appears he sold it to a collector named Adriaen Banck for the price of 500 Florins. alt= = Later Modifications = In 2015 it was discovered that the painter and collector Sir Joshua Reynolds altered Susanna and the Elders after obtaining it for his collection in the late 18th century.Susanna and the Elders in the Berlin museum X-ray scans have revealed that large portions of the original work had been painted over, and other parts were removed with solvents. Reynolds made modifications to a good majority of the background, leaving only Rembrandt's figures, the Babylonian palace in the distance, and a few foreground elements untouched. It is unclear exactly why Reynolds made such extensive alterations to the painting, but he was known to modify work in his collection. = Ownership = * Collection of Adriaen Banck, 1647Entry 55 for Susanna and the Elders in Hofstede de Groot, 1915 * Collection of Adriaen Maen, 1660 * Collection of Baron Schonborn, 1738 * Collection of J.A.J. Aved, 1766 * Collection of Edmund Burke, 1769 * Collection of Sir Joshua Reynolds, 1795 * Purchased by Wilhelm von Bode for the Kaiser-Friedrich Museum in Berlin, 1883  Content  Alessandro Allori, Susanna and The Elders, 1561 The painting depicts the story of Susanna from the Catholic tradition. Susanna and the Elders was a relatively common Biblical scene for artists to depict, and there are examples from many past artists, Pieter Lastman being a notable example. Traditionally this story was interpreted as being about God's faithfulness and justice; when Susanna is wrongfully accused and facing execution, she prays and is saved by the wise plan that Daniel comes up with to test the elders' testimony. Artists painting this scene usually infused it with eroticism, presenting Susanna in a tantalizing manner. Most depictions of this story portray Susanna as a temptress or a Venus like figure. This is particularly visible in Alessandro Allori's version of Susanna, for example, where she almost seems to be cavorting with the men rather than trying to get away. In others, such as Lastman's, the elders' intrusion is seen as more of a minor annoyance, rather than an assault. Rembrandt's piece, however, favors a more grounded telling of the story, without the added allure, focusing on the moral aspect and Susanna as a victim.  Visual Description  Rembrandt's Susanna has a major difference from previous versions. Whereas earlier Susanna paintings had a sensual, erotic quality to them, Rembrandt showed it more like an attempted assault as described in the story. Susanna attempts to pull away from the elder that has taken hold of her garment. She makes eye contact with the viewer, perhaps appealing for help. It has also been suggested that the viewer becomes a participant in a way, instead of a hidden voyeur as with other versions. Her expression appears distressed, unlike earlier versions of the painting where she would look bemused or even lustful. With this, it becomes less of an erotic piece for the patron and more about the story itself. The painting has rich colors and the intense shadow and light that Rembrandt is known for. Susanna is in the process of disrobing and stepping into the pool for a bath when she is interrupted by the two elders. She looks distressed as the younger of the two grabs hold of her robe and leers down at her. Many features of the painting have an Orientalist feel to them. Examples can be seen in the surroundings, which are lush, with very dense tropical foliage surrounding the pool and lining the far bank of the river. The garb worn by the elders is another example, particularly the turbans they wear. Additionally, a Babylonian palace is visible in the background. These \\"Eastern\\" features were known to Dutch artists by way of books of illustrations from traders that had been to Asia and recorded what they saw. These features are a type of fantasy, based on written information, sketches, and other secondhand accounts. File:Rembrandt - Study for Susannah Bathing - Louvre.jpgLouvre (HdG 58).

The work is oil on a single oak panel and now located in the J. Paul Getty Museum.\\"The Abduction of Europa\\" , The J. Paul Getty Museum The inspiration for the painting is Ovid's Metamorphoses, part of which tells the tale of Zeus's seduction and capture of Europa. The painting shows a coastal scene with Europa being carried away in rough waters by a bull while her friends remain on shore with expressions of horror. Rembrandt combined his knowledge of classical literature with the interests of the patron in order to create this allegorical work. The use of an ancient myth to impart a contemporary thought and his portrayal of the scene using the High Baroque style are two strong aspects of the work. Rembrandt and classical art The Abduction of Europa is Rembrandt's reinterpretation of the story, placed in a more contemporary setting. Rembrandt developed an interest in the classical world early in his life while in AmsterdamRosenberg, 271 which was a growing business-oriented center, and where he found work with great success. During this time, the international High Baroque style was popular. Rembrandt did not complete many mythological subject paintings. Out of three hundred sixty completed works, five displayed tales from the Metamorphoses, five depicted goddesses, a Carthaginian queen, all of which only five represented myth subjects.Schwartz, 119. Rembrandt occasionally used these mythological paintings as allegory, applying the tale to some Christian theme or a moral tradition.Schwartz, 119.

Specx had established a trading center in Japan in 1609, served as the Governor of Batavia (former name of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital), and later returned to Holland in 1633.Bomford, 82 and Schwartz, 124. The painting was in Specx's collection, along with five portraits, also by Rembrandt. The subject and its allegorical meaning are described by the Flemish art theorist, Karel van Mander, in Het schilder-boeck (1618). Rembrandt The book was produced in Amsterdam and included details about many Netherlands painters. Rembrandt surely would have familiarized himself with van Mander's theories and interpretations of Ovid's myths.Schwartz, 123. Van Mander commented on Europa's abduction, with a European spin to it. Ovid's account of the abduction of Europa is found in Book II 833-75 of Metamorphoses.Westermann, 117. Europa is a princess of Tyre, who is playing with her court on the coast when a beautiful bull appears. Europa mounts the bull, which quickly whisks her away into the ocean. When Europa and her friends notice the bull retreating further into the sea without coming back, the bull transforms into Zeus and carries her to Mount Olympus on the island of Crete.Westermann, 117. Rembrandt's painting is set just as Europa is whisked away, as seen by the bull and young lady in the ocean in the painting. Karel van Mander, from Het schilder-boeck, 1604 Art historians, like Mari√´t Westermann and Gary Schwartz interpret the painting as a reference to Specx' career. The painting includes details from Ovid's story that strengthen the location of the tale as well as tie it to Specx' life. The African driver and non-European coach in the shadows to the right allude to the exotic Phoenician coast. There is a port in the background, a reference to the busy port of the Tyre.Westermann, 118. Karel van Mander looked for an applicable meaning to the work that constructed a moral concept to the classical literature. He quoted an unnamed ancient source that stated that the abducted princess was representative of \\"the human soul, borne by the body through the troubled sea of this world\\".Schwartz, 125. Van Mander theorized that the bull, which is Zeus in the classical tale, is really the name of a ship that bore Europa from her eastern home of Tyre to the western continent that adopts her name.Schwartz, 125. The literary comments of van Mander are essential to deconstructing the allegorical subject of Europa. In the story, Zeus whisks Europa away to Crete. In van Mander's interpretation, she is moved by ship to Crete. Just as Specx's career was to move treasures of Asia to Europe by ship, so too is Europa moved from her Eastern home to Europe.Schwartz, 124. Rembrandt's familiarity with the literary and classical nature of the story is evident by the bull as both god and ship, and the harbor installation in the background. The harbor is representative of the busy trading ports in both Tyre and Europe.Schwartz, 124. The portrayal of Tyre, though, seems fairly modern with the inclusion of a crane, a tool which did not exist in the first century when Ovid was alive. This detail strengthens the parallel between Tyre and the Dutch ports, as Rembrandt attempts to connect the story to Specx's livelihood. The relationship also alludes to Europa's impending new destination, where she will give Europe her name.Westermann, 118. Most scholars agree that this narrative was chosen specifically by Rembrandt to reinterpret and mirror Specx's career. Influence of the Baroque Artistically, The Abduction of Europa reflects the attitudes and interests of Rembrandt and other Dutch painters during the early to mid seventeenth century. The work embodies the international High Baroque with dramatic lighting coming from the left and the high drama in the moment of abduction. This style was popular in Leiden, his birth town. The High Baroque was also present in the Ruben's work that Rembrandt studied.Rosenburg, 271. The idyllic shore and the detailed reflections in the water show the growing interest in naturalism in art.Westermann, 118. Naturalism plays a strong part in other aspects of the piece. Rembrandt contrasts the dark trees against the light blues and pinks skies. Rembrandt also uses light to further dramatize the piece, as seen by the glittering of gold on the dresses and carriages.\\"The Abduction of Europa\\" , The J. Paul Getty Museum The depiction of Europa on the bull combines these details: there is a clear reflection of the figures in the water, her dress has golden threads, and even her jewelry reflects some light. There was also a growing interest in historical landscape painting in Southern Netherlands. Artistic interests like genre, landscape, and myth painting, all combine in this one work. Titian's influence The Rape of Europa, Titian 1560-1562 Rembrandt was not the first artist to represent the abduction of Europa by Zeus. The Italian artist, Titian, created a similar work nearly seventy years before. Many art historians agree that Titian was a huge influence on Rembrandt, including Westermann who connects the two artists in their comparison works of Dana√´.Westermann, 121. Rembrandt is often called the \\"Titian of the north\\", and many of his portrait pieces show the influence of the Titian style and technique.Schwartz, 1214 and Westermann, 156-157. Though Rembrandt never traveled to Italy, Venetian paintings that traveling to Amsterdam increased as it grew as an art center. Amy Golahny, in a dissertation, justifies this thought. She writes, \\"When the Secretary to the Staudthouder asked the two young painters [Rembrandt and Jan Lievens] why they did not undertake the journey to Italy to study the great monuments there, and especially the works of Raphael and Michelangelo, they replied that there was an abundance of Italian art already to be viewed in Holland.\\"Golahny, 69. The presence of Italian art must have been strong, for Rembrandt kept a portrait of Titians' Money-changers in his studio.Golahny, 69. A sure connection and influence, then, would be Titian's representation of the same Ovidian story. While the influences of Titian's Europa (1560‚Äì62) are recognizable, Rembrandt's work is unique. Both pieces reflects the heightened drama of the piece, but Titian's work is more violent in nature.\\"Europa\\", The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, 2014. Philip II of Spain commissioned the piece, and Titian uses the psychological depiction of Europa's horror and nudity to reflect the sexual violence of the moment.\\"Europa\\", The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, 2014. Rembrandt's work is less serious a depiction of the violence, but still keeps the climatic moment alive. Titian keeps the figures in ancient dress, himations and chitons, keeping strong the mythological nature of the work. Rembrandt places his figures in contemporary Dutch dress, making the story more relatable to his viewer. Rembrandt's work is set in a realistic setting, removing the cherubs from the work, instead placing the story in a highly familiar nature setting for his Dutch audience, Specx. Rembrandt makes these changes not only to set himself apart from Titian, but also to gear the work specifically in mind to the commissioner of the work. Lasting tradition Rembrandt's The Abduction of Europa displays much about the artistic influences of his time. His work in mindful of the patron, painted in the popular High Baroque style, and incorporates the influences of earlier artists like Titian. This piece is only one of the mythological subject he completed, but Rembrandt's others display many of the same influences as this. Notes References *Bomford, David. Rembrandt.

The piece is oil on canvas and now located in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. The piece is intriguing stylistically in its unique figural composition and variety of lighting effects. Aside from composition, the painting is notable in terms of its historical context, from the connection between its subject matter and Rembrandt's family situation to its endangered location during World War II. Description The \\"Descent from the Cross\\" is a classic scene in religious themed art and, like many artists before and after him, Rembrandt portrayed this scene many times. In the Hermitage edition of the work, the figural arrangement is quite complex. While the scene is crowded, each person in the image has a specific facial expression, for the most part wracked with emotion. This emotion is shown in the weeping, open mourning of the women, and the more pensive, silently tense expressions of inner grief displayed by the men.Ragghianti, Great Museums of the World: Hermitage, Leningrad, 88. Jesus‚Äô mother, Mary, is portrayed in the work as unconscious, having fainted from the overwhelming grief and sadness. She is portrayed as physically, and likely mentally, supported by the other bystanders. Jesus himself is portrayed in a realistic fashion, with his body slumped and twisted rather unsettlingly as he is carried down the cross displaying the lifeless quality of his form. Jesus‚Äô physical body shape is very rounded, almost Rubenesque, raising the question of whether Rembrandt was influenced by Rubens‚Äô notably voluptuous figures.Van de Wetering, Rembrandt: The Painter at Work, 287. Also evident on the body are the marks of the thorn crown and the stigmata on Jesus‚Äô hands and feet. Lighting of this image is very elaborate and strategized upon certain figures creating groupings of bystanders. The intensity of the light is highly varied. The lightest and brightest areas are on Jesus‚Äô body, promoting it as the focal point of the piece, and the darkest area in the unlit, nearly black, inky background. Various torches and candles provide the light shed on the figures, as the scene takes place at night.Ragghianti, Great Museums of the World: Hermitage, Leningrad, 88. The different types of candles and torches provide different intensities of light. Although varying in degree, light specifically illuminates, and delineates, three main groups.Ibid. These groups are Jesus and the people carrying him, women laying out what appears to be a burial cloth, and Mary and her supporters. This strategic lighting seems to create a sort of order to the work, shedding light on what has happened, what will happen next, and the effect it has on others. Rembrandt often used religious scenes and imagery in his paintings. Rembrandt's family was quite wealthy, his father was a miller, and his mother a baker's daughter. Although he later created many biblical works, Rembrandt was not raised in the church. His mother was a Roman Catholic, and father belonged to the Dutch Reformed Church.Bull, Rembrandt-Caravaggio, 28. However, there is no evidence that Rembrandt belonged to a church. Throughout Rembrandt's youth and the early years of his career, the Netherlands was undergoing huge changes in religion in the form of the third wave of the Protestant Reformation.Israel, The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477‚Äì1806, 691. The third wave of the Reformation was followed closely by a large campaign by the Roman Catholic Jesuits to try and rekindle faith among Catholics. Dwindling numbers of Catholics and an influx of Protestant immigrants bringing about the end of the Roman Catholic era and the rise of Orthodox Calvinism that remains in the Netherlands to this day.Israel, The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477‚Äì1806, 692. Rembrandt's choice of this particular scene of biblical reference is part of both the Roman Catholic and the Protestant's belief systems. In more modern times, during World War II, the Hermitage Museum where Rembrandt's Descent from the Cross is housed faced the dilemma of what to do with the possibility of a siege of Leningrad. The museum's treasures, including Descent from the Cross, were evacuated from their displays. Paintings were taken out of their frames and packed into crates, with works that were too large or too fragile to be packed moved to the museum's vaults and cellars, which were reinforced against impending bombs. After the siege, the Hermitage was repaired and restocked with masterpieces, reopening in 1945.Varshavsky and Rest, The Ordeal of the Hermitage: The Siege of Leningrad, 1941‚Äì1944, 62.

The First Army Air Service was the largest and most diverse Air Service combat organization of the American Expeditionary Forces in France, and most American Air Service combat units were assigned to it when assigned to the front. The organization was demobilized in France on 15 April 1919 with the demobilization of the United States First Army. There is no modern United States Air Force unit that shares its lineage and history. History =Origins= First Army Air Service units and stations The history of the First Army Air Service dates to the first American Air Service personnel arriving in France. On 15 January 1918, Colonel William Mitchell was appointed Chief of the Air Service, I Corps, First Army. At this time, the I Corps was being formed for the purpose of administratively handling all of the American troops then on the Western Front. Headquarters was located at Neufch√¢teau, France. When the first American Aero Squadrons arrived at the front in April 1918, they were assigned to the quiet Toul Sector. At this time, the American Air Service on the front consisted of only a few Aero Squadrons of the 1st Pursuit Group.Series \\"C\\", Volume 1, Early history of Air Service commands at the Front. Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917‚Äì1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. At the end of June, 1918, Air Service, I Corps moved from the Toul Sector to the Ch√¢teau- Thierry Sector as part of I Corps. The I Corps Observation Group was already in the Chateau-Thierry Sector was under the command of First Army. The Assistant Chief of Air Service, Zone of Advance, felt it was necessary to coordinate the observation groups of First Army with the pursuit groups. On 10 August 1918, the First American Army Air Service was established. =Organization= The unit was formally organized on 26 August at Ligny-en- Barrois, France. It consisted of the French Aerial Division, which consisted of a large number of pursuit and day bombardment squadrons. In addition, there was one other French pursuit group and three American pursuit groups-one American day-bombardment group-the 1st Army observation, and one French Army artillery group for the adjustment of long-range artillery fire. Eight night- bombardment squadrons of the British Royal Air Force. were to cooperate with the First Army Air Service whenever the tactical situation made such action expedient. The establishment of the First Army Air Service marked the first concentration of American air forces under its own commander.Maurer, Maurer (1978), The US Air Service in World War I, The Office of Air Force History, Headquarters USAF Washington The front of the First Army, extending from Ch√¢tillon-sous-les-C√¥tes to Pont-sur-Seille, insofar as aviation was concerned, had been very quiet for some time. The enemy performed his photographic reconnaissances with single aircraft, flying at high altitudes, and his pursuit patrols were small and infrequent. In the matter of aerodromes, the enemy was better off than the First American Army, and possessed many small fields within access of any part of the front line. Several aerodromes were unoccupied, and were in such condition that they could be utilized quickly by reinforcements, their barracks and hangars being more or less serviceable.Maurer, Part One, A Tactical History of the Air Service For the Americans, almost every available field had been taken up and they were short in hangars and billet space, so that by the time the allocation of aviation units had been made to the First Army, the problems of locating and housing the units was a serious one. Corps Observation Groups Major John Reynolds, commander of the 91st Aero Squadron, standing next to his Salmson 2.A2 with the Squadron Emblem painted on the side of his aircraft, Gondreville-sur-Moselle Aerodrome, France, 1918 The Corps Air Service of each corps operating under First Army was made up of one squadron for each division and one squadron for the corps. The Air Service of the 2d Colonial Corps consisted entirely of French squadrons. The I Corps observation group was made up of the 1st, 12th, and 50th Aero Squadrons and two French squadrons. In the IV Corps group were the 8th, 135th, and 90th Aero Squadrons and one French squadron. The V Corps group consisted of the 88th, 99th, and 104th Aero Squadrons, only one of which had had a considerable experience in active front-line operations, the corps chief of Air Service and staff remained at the location of the group.Maurer, Part Two, A Tactical History of Corps Observation The I Corps group was located in the vicinity of Toul on two aerodromes. The 1st and 12th Aero Squadrons were stationed at Gengault Aerodrome just east of Toul, which had formerly been occupied by the 1st Pursuit Group in the spring of 1918. The 50th Aero and 211th (French) Squadrons occupied the newly constructed Bicqueley Aerodrome, just south of Toul. The IV Corps group entire occupied Ourches Aerodrome. The French squadrons of the Air Service of the 2d French Colonial Corps were located at Rumont, to the northeast of Bar-le-Duc. The V Corps group occupied Souilly Aerodrome. With the exception of the V Corps group, each Corps Air Service was established and ready for operations by the first week in September. The V Corps group was not completed until the day of the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, when the 88th Squadron arrived from the Vesle. The one new squadron of the I Corps group, the 50th Aero, had but recently arrived at the front. It was equipped with Airco_DH.4 airplanes with the new Liberty engine. Two of the three American squadrons of the IV Corps group were also equipped with the De Havilland DH.4 Liberty; the 90th Squadron had French Salmson 2.A2 airplanes. In the V Corps group all squadrons were equipped with the Salmson. First Army Observation Group During the inactive period on the Toul sector covering the late spring and summer of 1918 and up to the St. Mihiel offensive which commenced on 12 September, army observation in the American Air Service was carried out by one unit, the 91st Aero Squadron. The 91st served as a nucleus for the long-range reconnaissance missions for First Army; while the various Corps observation groups were used for battlefield, tactical observation missions. Previous to its assignment to the First Army, the 91st worked under orders of the Chef de I'Aeronautique of the 8th French Army. The group added two new aero squadrons, the 24th and the 9th, but as these had not had actual battle experience, they did little work other than perfecting their own training. The 91st Aero Squadron, therefore, took care of all of the long- range day reconnaissances.Maurer, Part Three, A Tactical History of Army Observation 1st Day Bombardment Group 11th Aero Squadron posing with its De Havilland DH.4s (Note \\"Mr Jiggs\\" on each fuselage), Maulan Aerodrome, France, November 1918 1st Day Bombardment Group had its beginning 18 May 1918, when the 96th Aero Squadron, the first unit of day bombardment, was established at Amanty Aerodrome to begin active operations against the enemy. The flying equipment of the 96th Squadron consisted of ten Breguet 14B.2 bombing airplanes, equipped with 300 horsepower type 12 F. E. V. Renault motors. The 1st Day Bombardment Group had a threefold object: the destruction of material, reconnaissance, and observation of enemy tactics in combat. Except during an offensive there was but little opportunity to attack massed troops. The principal mission during such a period was to destroy the enemy's transport lines by which supplies and personnel were delivered to the front, or by which ore and other products of military importance were delivered to the rear. The most favorable targets were the railroad centers where the traffic arteries converged. Long distance raids proved wonderful opportunities for deep reconnaissance, especially of enemy railroad movements. Any pronounced current of railroad traffic, going in one direction, or converging at one point, would be reported by every observer making that particular raid. Further confirmation was unnecessary, for the observers were obliged to submit their written raid reports without consulting each other. Photographs of the bursts often revealed troop and construction activity at the objectives, and were subject to careful interpretation. 1st Pursuit Wing Lithograph of 1st Lieutenant Frank Luke \\"Balloon Busting\\", 27th Aero Squadron. Two American pursuit groups were in process of organization for the establishment of the 1st Pursuit Wing. These were already located at Gengault and Vaucouleurs Aerodromes.Maurer, Part Four, A Tactical History of Pursuit Aviation All of the American pursuit squadrons in existence, with the exception of the 17th and 148th Aero Squadrons, which were operating with the British, were concentrated in the 1st Pursuit Wing, with headquarters at Toul, and the 1st Pursuit Group, with headquarters at Rembercourt Aerodrome. The 1st Pursuit Wing consisted of the 2d and 3d Pursuit Groups; the 2d Pursuit Group composed of the 13th, 22d, 49th and 139th Aero Squadrons, and the 3d Pursuit Group consisted of the 28th, 93d, 103d, and 213th Aero Squadrons. The 1st Pursuit Group consisted of the 27th, 94th, 95th, and 147th Aero Squadrons. One French Group (G.C.16) was allocated to the 1st American Pursuit Wing commander for duty in connection with the offensive. With these units at his disposal, and with the general conditions of the air program for the offensive in mind, the Chief of Air Service, First Army, made certain plans for the pursuit units for the attack. He decided to utilize the American pursuit all along the front for the purpose of protective barrage at all altitudes, with incidental duties as occasion arose, of a more combative nature, such as ground strafing, balloon destruction, and offensive patrols. Offensive patrols cross the enemy line in sufficient strength to cruise over his rear area, search out enemy aircraft, and attack them, with the object of causing maximum casualties and inflicting the greatest possible damage to his air service, and with the further object of obtaining definite moral superiority. =St. Mihiel offensive= Preparation In August 1918, the situation of the enemy in the St. Mihiel sector was approximately the same as that described in Toul sector. The sector of the front from Saint-Mihiel north to Ch√¢tillon-sous-les-C√¥tes was organized in approximately the same manner as the Toul or Saint-Mihiel sector. The enemy was favored by the terrain, which offered many natural positions of great strength. These positions had been well organized for a prolonged defense. Some intimation of an impending allied offensive in this sector had reached the enemy, and immediately preceding the attack of 12 September he commenced a redistribution of his available forces, especially with a view to echeloning them in depth. As far as was known at the time, the enemy strength in the sector remained about the same as it had been throughout the summer months. In the air the strength of the enemy continued the same as it had been since the previous spring. A few pursuit patrols of Fokker airplanes were reported as operating in this sector, but it was quite probable that these were new airplanes received as replacements for the Albatross and Pfalz type formerly in use. Individual observation and photograph airplanes operated over the sector, but no unusual number of hostile aircraft was at any time encountered or reported before the opening of the Saint-Mihiel offensive. The operations undertaken during the period of preparation. Visual reconnaissance, Photographic reconnaissance, Artillery fire adjustment, and Exercises with artillery and infantry. Visual reconnaissance of the corps and division sectors was carried out as a routine matter at dawn and twilight of each day. A few other special visual reconnaissance missions were dispatched to secure information of a particular nature in well-defined areas. The work of visual reconnaissance was valuable only in that it kept the command informed at all times of the situation in the enemy lines opposite each corps. The information secured in this manner was for the most part of a negative nature, due to the inactivity of the enemy at this period, but it served the purpose of assuring the staff of each corps that there were no new developments in the general tactical situation. Photographic reconnaissance, during the period of preparation, consisted for the most part of taking oblique views of the enemy territory immediately opposite the front lines of each corps. This type of photograph proved of great value in the preparation of detailed plans for the attack. No great amount of adjustment of artillery fire took place, due to the necessity of veiling all preparations for the offensive. The shoots executed were therefore merely those necessary to register the fire of a few batteries on certain points. Exercises were conducted as frequently as possible in each corps for the purpose of preparing the infantry and artillery to cooperate successfully with the airplane observer during the coming offensive. All operations were greatly hindered by the unfavorable weather which prevailed during the early days of September. The 1st Day Bombardment Group was formed two days before the offensive opened, and included the 11th, 20th, and 96th Aero Squadrons. The 11th and 20th Squadrons had not completed their squadron organization. Some of their pilots and observers had seen action with the French squadrons, but most of them made their first flights over the lines during this offensive. The two new squadrons operated De Havilland DH.4 airplanes, with Liberty motors. The armament was the same as that of the French Breguet, save that the pilot had two Marlin machine guns, synchronized to shoot through the propeller. The De Havilland DH.4s carried the British Wimperis bomb sight attached to the outside of the fuselage. This sight permitted the observer to aim at the target while standing, a position which kept him in readiness to fight off an attack by hostile aircraft. During the period preparatory to the attack, from 29 August to 12 September, the 1st Pursuit Wing, working on the front between the Meuse and the Moselle Rivers, maintained patrols sufficient to prevent any reconnaissance, visual or photographic, of the area Lionville, Beuconville, Domeurs, Francheville, Becq and Gironville. The Wing commander divided the sector for this purpose into two areas, the western running from St. Mihiel to Essey, both inclusive, and the eastern, Seicheprey to Pont-sur-Seille, both inclusive, and gave orders that a double tier barrage should be maintained from daylight to dark over these sectors. The low patrol, acting at from 2,500 to 3,500 meters, and the higher patrol at from 3,500 to 5,500 meters. Each patrol overlapped by 15 minutes, and were not permitted to penetrate over the enemy lines more than five kilometers. By 5 September, the wing had made an area approximately 5 kilometers over the enemy's lines practically safe for corps observation machines to operate. Some close protection work was ordered to act in cooperation with the army reconnaissance squadron, and one particularly dangerous balloon near Mont Sec was attacked repeatedly. Operations The St. Mihiel offensive is chiefly remarkable in that it was the first all- American large scale operation of World War I. During the four days of the American offensive which cleared the St. Mihiel salient of the enemy, weather conditions, except on 14 September, were such as to greatly hinder the carrying out of aerial operations. =Tactical Reconnaissance= 12th Aero Squadron Salmson 2.A2, Julvecourt Aerodrome, France, November 1918 On the morning of 12 September, when the attack was launched, a heavy mist, low-lying cloud banks, and intermittent rain combined to make all aerial observation extremely difficult. Notwithstanding this fact, command airplanes for the corps and divisions, infantry contact patrols, and artillery surveillance airplanes performed their respective missions throughout the hours of daylight. The command was thus kept informed of the general progress of the battle and at periodic intervals was given the first line of our advancing troops located by observers executing the missions of infantry contact. Missions operating in cooperation with the artillery were unable, on account of atmospheric conditions, to accomplish much work of value in the regulation of artillery fire on fugitive targets, but, taking advantage of momentary gaps in the clouds and mist, they were able to observe and report upon the location of such targets from time to time and to furnish other information of considerable value to the artillery. The work accomplished on 13 September was virtually a repetition of that of the 12th, for the same unfavorable weather conditions continued. 14 September was the one day during the offensive which was favorable for the conduct of aerial operations by the Corps Air Service. Missions of every type were dispatched, throughout the hours of daylight. Command airplanes, infantry contact patrols, and visual reconnaissance missions kept the command well informed as to the progress of the attacking troops and of the situation within the enemy lines to a depth of 8 kilometers. Photographic missions were executed and resulted in a large number of successful photographs of the enemy's front-line positions. Artillery surveillance airplanes secured much valuable information which was immediately sent by radio to the artillery posts of command and later confirmed by both dropped messages and telephonic reports upon the return of the observer to the aerodrome. Some successful adjustments of the fire of designated batteries upon fugitive targets located in the enemy lines were accomplished. From early morning of the 14th there was a very noticeable increase of hostile pursuit aviation. Some of the best enemy flights operated along the sector and observation airplanes were repeatedly attacked, but in the majority of cases successfully defended themselves and accomplished their assigned missions. On 15 September, unfavorable weather again greatly hindered aerial operations; the work done was similar to that accomplished during the first two days of the offensive. =Strategic Reconnaissance= Targets were indicated by the Chief of Staff, First Army for strategic reconnaissance missions deep behind German lines to be carried out by the First Army Observation Group. These targets were various artillery objectives, to be photographed just before and on every day during the attack until further notice. A continuous barrage of observation planes was to be maintained over enemy territory throughout the entire day. Formations of three planes were scheduled to leave the aerodrome at intervals of two hours, beginning at daybreak, to reconnoiter the enemy's rear areas. It was considered necessary to employ formations of at least three planes, as there was no pursuit protection available and the friendly pursuit patrols did not penetrate the enemy lines to the same depth that the army reconnaissance planes were required to go. It was certain all these planes would be vigorously attacked by enemy aircraft. However, owing to the prevailing adverse weather conditions, it was necessary to disregard the schedules that were prepared the preceding day as the low hanging clouds rendered formation flying impossible. Photography was out of the question. Single planes were dispatched whenever the weather permitted. The planes were required to fly at low altitudes, under the clouds but proved successful, in that they could climb into the clouds and to safety in case of the appearance of enemy aircraft, or when especially heavy and accurate anti-aircraft fire was encountered. During the first day the enemy territory was successfully reconnoitered to a depth of 60 kilometers. Not one mission was carried out at an altitude exceeding 1,000 meters. This was accomplished without the loss of a single plane or even a single casualty. However, because of the rapid increase in numbers of enemy pursuit planes as the battle progressed, the successful reconnoitering of the enemy back areas became extremely difficult. The reinforcing enemy pursuit was largely equipped with the Fokker D VII scouts. This plane had a considerable advantage in climbing speed over the Salmson. However, the horizontal speed of the latter plane was greater at high altitudes, thereby enabling it to break off a combat at any desirable time. The effective work done and the comparatively small number of casualties suffered during the St. Mihiel offensive, gave evidence of the excellent training and experience gained during the previous three months. =Day Bombardment= Breguet 14B.2 bomber of the 96th Aero Squadron Bombing operations during the offensive were directed against hostile troops concentrations immediately behind the enemy's lines as primary objectives, and raids to railroads centers which were congested with troops and supplies as secondary objectives. To interfere with traffic of reinforcements and supplies from the sector east of the Moselle river it was found expedient to send bombing expeditions against the bridges, and bridgeheads, between Pont-a- Mousson and Metz. The main object of day bombardment during the offensive was to throw into confusion and destroy enemy troops marching into, or retreating from battle. During the days of exploitation the bombers continued to hamper as much as possible the enemy's withdrawal of personnel and material.Maurer, Part Five, A Tactical History of Day Bombardment Late at night, 11 September, orders were received to hold the 9th Aero Squadron on the alert early in the morning, to bomb and machine gun hostile troops in front of our advancing infantry. To carry out these orders the twelve available Breguets were divided into flights of four each. The plan was to send the flights over to attack at 30-minute intervals, and thus keep up the enemy troops under a continuous bombardment. The first order to raid was received at 10 A.M. The objective was troop concentration at Buxieres, in the town and along the roads radiating from it. Because of the strong wind and the low cloud ceiling it was considered impracticable to attempt even these small formation flights. Consequently, that the order be obeyed, the leading team of the first flight volunteered to attempt the mission alone, and to determine, if possible, the best method of conducting troop bombing under the existing unfavorable conditions. The team did not return. It was later learned that the Breguet came down in flames south of Commercy, while returning to the aerodrome. The mission had been accomplished. After this first loss of the offensive it was decided to send all the airplanes on single missions, and not dissipate the strength of the squadron in small formations. The casualties of the bombers were heavy. The 96th Aero Squadron lost sixteen pilots and observers during the first four days of the attack, which is a high percentage of loss even in a day bombardment unit. The 11th Aero Squadron lost twelve of its flying personnel, and the 20th Aero Squadron three. The total casualties of the group for the offensive numbered thirty-one. However, the work done by day bombardment during the St. Mihiel offensive is worthy of praise. The terrific weather made formation flying, upon which bombing depends, almost impossible. The muddy flying field caused so many broken propellers that the formations which crossed the lines were never large enough for self-protection. The main lesson learned from this offensive was that large formations must be employed by day bombardment when the enemy aircraft opposition is strong and persistent. As it was impossible to obtain sufficient replacements in airplanes and spare parts the formations were small and the losses heavy. =1st Pursuit Wing= 13th Aero Squadron - SPAD XII On 12 September, throughout the day there were high winds, and rain fell intermittently. The usual functions of the pursuit aviation could not be performed, but the pursuit planes were used to secure valuable information and to harass by machine-gun and bombs the retreating enemy. Many favorable objectives presented themselves, especially over the Vigneville-Chambley and the Vigneulles St. Benoit roads. The 3d Pursuit Group, equipped its airplanes with bombs, and an these roads, together with assistance of the machine guns of the 2nd and 1st Pursuit Groups, constantly threw into confusion the retreating German forces. Owing to weather conditions on the opening day, few large patrols were used, and many individual reconnaissances were made by pursuit pilots of the lst, 2d and 3d Group. Often single aircraft determined and reported the advance of our front line, actually flying down to 50 meters, and co-operating with the troops on the ground. By 13 September, shortly after midnight, infantry patrols from the south and those from the west met near Vigneulles. Still the enemy was in retreat. The Chambley, Mars-la-Tour road was jammed with his reinforcements coming up and his wagons in retreat. In one day the 3d Pursuit Group made five expeditions bombing and harassing with machine guns, protected by elements of the 2nd Pursuit Group. The 1st Pursuit Group on its sector harassed the infantry, maintaining protective patrols above at different altitudes. But, it was not until 14 September, when the weather cleared, that pursuit aviation was able to operate at its normal altitude. Enemy Balloons were attacked with determination, and massed enemy troops withdrawn on 12, 13 and 14 September were harassed and repeatedly thrown into confusion. Large enemy formations of aircraft when they appeared were fought gallantly even by inferior members, and every opportunity of making observations from pursuit planes was seized with eagerness. =Meuse- Argonne Offensive= Reorganization Shortly after the conclusion of the St. Mihiel offensive a certain redistribution of units took place between the various Corps Air Services in preparation for the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. The three American Army Corps which were to take part in the main offensive were the I, III and V. The IV Corps was to be enlarged to include the former sector of the I Corps. The IV Corps, the 2d French Colonial Corps, and the 33d French Corps were to remain in place and not take part in the main offensive. One American Aero squadron was relieved from the Air Service of the IV Corps, leaving the 8th and 135th Aero Squadrons and one French squadron in the group at Ourches Aerodrome. The Air Service of the 2d French Colonial Corps was composed of the same squadrons as had participated in the St. Mihiel offensive. The Air Service of the 33d French Corps was made up of French squadrons with headquarters at Beauzee. The III Corps Observation Group was located on the aerodromes at Souilly Aerodrome, Vavincourt Aerodrome, and Beauzee Aerodromes. The group comprised the 88th and 90th Aero Squadrons and three French squadrons. The V Corps Observation Group included the 99th and 186th Aero Squadrons and two French squadrons. The V Corps Observation Group was established at Foucaucourt Aerodrome. The I Corps Observation Group, located at Remicourt Aerodrome, was made up of three American squadrons, the lst, 12th, and 50th Aero Squadron, and one French squadron. The 1st Day Bombardment Group was used to attack from high altitudes, large objectives such as towns and railroad stations from which traffic is radiating. In situations when intelligence received that specially favorable targets are presenting themselves within 6 or 8 kilometers of our front lines, this group was ordered to attack such targets at low altitude in order to cause confusion and material damage to enemy elements arriving as reinforcements or retreating. The enemy air service was largely concentrated in the Conflans- Briey area, and the period between 14 and 25 September was marked by severe and repeated combats. Between 20‚Äì23 September, the 2d, and 3d Pursuit Groups of the 1st Pursuit Wing changed station[, but this changing station was not allowed to interfere with operations which were still carried on over the front created by the St. Mihiel battle. The 1st Pursuit Group remained at Rembercourt Aerodrome but it too confined its operations to the sector east of the Meuse. G.C. 16 of the French Army was relieved from duty with the 1st Pursuit Wing. The wing headquarters moved from Toul to Chaumont-sur-Aire; the 2d Pursuit Group moved from Gengault Aerodrome to the Belrain Aerodrome, and the 3d Pursuit Group moved from the Vaucouleurs Aerodrome to the Lisle-en- Barrois Aerodrome. The wing headquarters and its groups perfected liaison with the corps air service, the army observation group, and the armies to the right and left of the 1st Army. For the Argonne-Meuse offensive, the 1st Pursuit Group was allotted the rather new task of combating enemy battle flights and of destroying balloons. In other words, all of its operations were confined to extremely low altitudes during the morning hours. However, its squadrons were available for an offensive operation in the afternoon, and vice versa. The group assigned to patrol in the afternoon will be on the alert in the morning to carry out an offensive operation, in which the entire group may be called upon to participate at medium and high altitudes, penetrating about 12 kilometers beyond our advancing lines to clean the air of enemy aviation. The 2d and 3d Pursuit Groups were assigned the mission to maintain protective patrols within the enemy's lies for the defense of our army corps air service and to attack enemy reconnaissance planes, but it will also be necessary from time to time to take the offensive with a display of dominating force, sending out powerful expeditions so as to cover intermediate and high altitudes and to sweep the air clear of enemy aviation up to a depth, 10 or 12 kilometers inside the lines. Most of the enemy aviation is concentrated in the region of Metz, especial attention will be paid to the sector between the Meuse and Chatillon. Operations The unfavorable weather encountered during the St. Mihiel Offensive continued the greater part of the time between 26 September and 11 November. There were occasional ideal flying days, but for the most part weather conditions were poor to impossible and proved a great handicap in carrying out aerial operations. Haze and fog obscured the ground to a great extent in the early morning and late afternoon during the last four weeks of the offensive. =Tactical Reconnaissance= Capt James E. Meredith, commander 99th Aero Squadron next to his Salmson 2.A2 at Luxeuil- les-Bains Aerodrome, France, July 1918 In considering the work performed by the Corps Observation Groups these weather conditions must be kept in mind as an element which affected the execution of each type of mission. In the matter of reconnaissance and infantry contact patrol work they produced some radical departures from the methods ordinarily used. The photographic missions undertaken during the period from 26 September to 11 November were in almost every case confined to the taking of photographs of well-defined areas of particular interest to the G-2 section of the corps and Army staffs. Atmospheric conditions were so infrequently favorable to the taking of large numbers of photographs that those possible were necessarily directed to cover areas of the most immediate interest to the staff. A considerable number of missions were devoted to the securing of oblique photographs, as had been the case during the preparation of the St. Mihiel offensive. Such photographs were of value particularly with respect to the preparation of plans for the advance of the divisional infantry. At other times, it became necessary to photograph certain sensitive points in the enemy territory. Such missions, which require the greatest care, were assigned to flying teams of long experience. To attain success in them it was necessary that both pilot and observer be thoroughly familiar with the exact locality to be photographed so that no mistake would be made in securing photographs of the exact points desired. Unfavorable weather prevailed, to such an extent that it was never practical to attempt to photograph all the area of the front lines as fast as the troops advanced. In this offensive, as had been the case on the Marne, photographic missions were invariably given protection against attacking hostile pursuit airplanes. The large number of enemy pursuit flights operating in the sector made it practically certain that a photographic mission would be attacked one or more times during the course of the flight. Protection by pursuit patrols from the nearest pursuit group was utilized to a large extent by photographic missions dispatched from the III Corps Observation Group, and with excellent results. On the other hand, the missions of a like nature sent out from the I and V Corps groups employed for the most part biplace protection offered by airplanes from the groups themselves. The pursuit protection, however, ceased to operate close in to the photographic airplane as in the Mame sector. It was found that better results could be obtained by flying a more or less erratic course some 500 meters above the photographic airplane. This method allowed the pursuit airplanes to retain the advantage of their maneuverability and at the same time to assure to the photographic mission considerable protection in the event of attack. =Strategic Reconnaissance= The attack commenced on the morning of 26 September with ideal weather conditions. On the four days previous low clouds and rain had prevented any effective work from being carried out. This had a decided effect on the first days work, due to lack of familiarity with the terrain. This fact, coupled with the activity of the hostile air forces, interfered greatly with the success of the photographing of the artillery objectives, and to some extent with the visual work. Weather conditions throughout the whole operations were extremely bad. Only ten days out of the whole period were suitable for army strategic observation. The most was made of the small amount of good weather, and with two-day squadrons operating an immense amount of work was accomplished. The last three days of October being perfect, gave opportunity for very important work to be accomplished in preparation for the attack, which commenced on 1 November. The areas opposite the American front were reconnoitered and photographed thoroughly, but the work was done in the face of intense opposition by hostile aircraft. One of the most valuable pieces of work carried out during the last three days of October was the photographing of the army artillery objectives at Montmedy, Longuyon, Spincourt, Dommary-Baroncourt and Conflans. The enemy had protected these points by intense antiaircraft barrages, and high patrols of pursuit planes, but in spite of these obstacles, the objectives were photographed both before and after registration fire, allowing the artillery to fire effectively during the attack. The missions assigned varied in character; from verifying reports as to the location of the front lines, to the seeking out of enemy reserves at points where counter-attacks were expected. This work was carried out by single planes flying at extremely low altitudes. The command planes sometimes penetrated hostile territory to a depth of 15 kilometers, and were constantly exposed to heavy machine gun and anti-aircraft artillery fire. They were especially liable to attack by pursuit planes which had every advantage of speed, maneuverability, and position. The strain of flying under these conditions coupled with the necessarily close confinement while awaiting orders, made it necessary that the teams be changed every ten days, and personnel from each of the squadrons in the group were sent out on this work successfully. =Night Reconnaissance= Night Reconnaissance work promised to bring in valuable information, since most military movements of importance are made at night. In order that it may be performed successfully, perfect conditions of visibility and a highly trained personnel were necessary. The 9th Aero Squadron was the only night reconnaissance unit in the American Air Service. The poor weather conditions throughout the Argonne-Meuse operation gave little opportunity for the squadron to work. In addition, only a very few of the flyers had been trained for night work. In spite of these handicaps it is only fair to say that on the few nights suitable for observation, information of value was obtained, and considerable damage done to the enemy by bombing. =Day Bombardment= 20th Aero Squadron Lieutenant Leslie P. Koepfgen with his crew. From the left: Howard W. Wolf, Marion Lappin, Koepfgen, James W. Mone and Earl G. Crain with Koepfgen's Airco DH.4. The objectives for bombardment in the Meuse Argonne Offensive were similar to those of the St. Mihiel offensive. The 1st Day Bombardment Group was used to attack, from high altitudes where possible, such towns as Romagne, St. Juvin, Grandpre, Bantheville, and Dun-sur-Meuse, and railroad centers from which traffic was radiating. Early in the offensive missions were carried out against troop concentrations between the Meuse River and the Argonne forest. When intelligence was received of favorable targets within six or eight kilometers of the lines, the group was ordered to attack such objectives at low altitude to cause the maximum amount of confusion and damage to the enemy elements as reinforcements for retreating before our infantry. With the increase of formation strength, and improvement in skill of the bombing personnel, the group wrought telling havoc on the objectives of the Argonne-Meuse. Fires were frequently started with incendiary bombs. Due to the incessant cloudy weather most of the early raids were made at an altitude of 1,500 to 2,500 meters. The antiaircraft fire of the enemy was so accurate that the flight leaders found it necessary to fly at least 500 meters below the background of clouds. 4 October was a very successful day for the bombers. Dun-sur-Meuse was hit with a ton and a half of bombs, and Landres St. Georges with a like amount. The combats of the day were severe. In each attack the enemy numbered about thirty Fokkers and Pfalz. The clouds were low and afforded many lurking pockets for the enemy pursuit. In the last flight the 96th Aero Squadron was attacked by the full formation of enemy airplanes. The bombing squadron tightened up and kept the pursuers at bay until the 26th Aero Squadron and 11th Aero Squadron attacked the Fokkers and Pfalz in the rear. Two of the enemy were seen to go down. When the combat was the hottest thirty Spads from the 2d Pursuit Group arrived on schedule time and joined in the general fight. The enemy was in a trap and could not escape combat with all our forces. The Spads brought down eleven of the enemy, bringing the total of victories of the fight up to thirteen. Members of the 166th Aero Squadron in front of a De Havilland DH.4. Another highly successful raid was the shock attack on Bayonville, 18 October, on which the group dropped four tons of bombs. The bombs burst in the middle of the town. It was later learned that on this single raid 250 of the enemy troops were killed by our bombs and 750 wounded. According to instructions from headquarters the bombing squadrons returned by way of St. Juvin to encourage our infantry. A successful raid was made by the group on Montmedy, 4 November. Numerous fires were started and great damage done to buildings and warehouses. The hottest combat of the offensive was fought on returning from this mission. Two airplanes of the 11th Aero Squadron went down in flames. Six of the enemy were shot down, two in flames. The last mission of the offensive was a raid on Mousson, on which good hits were made. On this last raid the 20th Aero Squadron lost three planes. Four of the enemy went down in flames or out of control. During the Meuse- Argonne operations the 1st Day Bombardment Group was distinguished for success in precision bombing. Enemy troops were attacked, material was destroyed, and the morale of the enemy so shaken that formations of bombers became the source of constant dread. Statistics of the air service show that two thirds of the enemy airplanes brought down, during the offensive, were brought down by, or in conjunction with day bombardment. =1st Pursuit Wing= 94th Aero Squadron - SPAD XIII The low work of the 1st Pursuit Group justified its introduction on the first day of the Argonne-Meuse attack, 26 September. Ten enemy balloons were shot down in flames on that date. The constant destruction and harassing of the enemy's balloons by the group resulted in the enemy detailing a certain force at all times for their protection, and he made many ingenious attempts to trap our pilots who were attacking his balloons. This resulted in counter schemes being employed in which not only were attacks on balloons carried out, but a number of enemy airplanes were brought down by the group. While many successful balloon attacks were made in the early morning and throughout the day, the most successful attacks were those carried on in the dusk of the evening. The 1st Pursuit Group in addition to its attacks on enemy balloons and its defensive work in destroying German battle-planes, was enabled to use shock action at low altitudes by means of a concentrated patrol of all squadrons which was made about three o‚Äôclock every afternoon. The policy employed with respect to the 1st Pursuit Wing of using large forces for shock action deep in the enemy's side of the lines, justified itself on the first day of the American attack in the Argonne Meuse area, 26 September. The first group sortie was made by the 2d Pursuit Group at dawn of 26 September and resulted in the destruction of 8 enemy airplanes. A similar sortie by the 3d Pursuit Group on the afternoon of 26 September resulted in the destruction of 3 more enemy planes. Eddie Rickenbacker, Douglas Campbell, and Kenneth Marr of the 94th Aero Squadron pose next to a Nieuport 28 fighter, 1918. One of the most successful shock operations carried out by the 1st Pursuit Wing was carried out on 18 October in which two squadrons of the 2d Pursuit Group, equipped with bombs and machine guns for the purpose of harassing group objectives flying at an extremely low altitude, two squadrons of the 3d Pursuit Group at between 2,000 and 3,000 meters, all four squadrons of the 1st Day Bombardment Group at 4,000 meters, and two more squadrons of the 3d Pursuit Group, flying at 4,500 meters, met at the previously appointed rendezvous of Bayonville at 3:30 in the afternoon. The enemy appeared in force, some 30 or 40 enemy planes being seen by our pilots. Their formation was broken up, at least nine of them were destroyed, and the others forced to return to their aerodromes. It is not to be forgotten that throughout the Argonne-Meuse operations both the 2d Pursuit Group and the 3d Pursuit Group were equipped with bombs for use in attacking ground objectives. Officers of the 185th Aero Squadron (Night Pursuit), Rembercourt Aerodrome, France, November 1918 During the offensive, a night pursuit squadron (185th Aero Squadron) was added to the 1st Pursuit Group for the purpose of attacking enemy bombers. The details connected with the organization of this service presented a whole series of new and difficult problems which were satisfactorily solved. After the introduction of the night pursuit squadron, very few night bombardment attacks were undertaken by the enemy. In a few cases our night pursuit pilots were able to come within range of the enemy raiders. The night pursuit squadron combined offensive tactics with its defense against enemy bombers, bombs on enemy posts of command and concentration of troops. In addition to its offensive shock patrols, the 1st Pursuit Wing carried on the more conventional protective patrols for which provision was made in the plan of employment, and also afforded a certain amount of close protection to the army corps observation planes. The imperative necessity of extremely close liaison with the corps air services in the carrying out of these missions was emphasized, and the policy was adopted in October of having the corps observation planes which were to receive close protection from pursuit planes, land on the aerodrome of the pursuit group assigned to give protection, so that the observation airplane crew and the pursuit patrol leader could come to a definite understanding of the work to be done and the methods of doing it. =Demobilization= On 11 November 1918, all offensive flying ended at 11:00am in compliance with the Armistice with Germany. As part of the Armistice, Allied Forces were to occupy the Rhineland area of Germany beginning on 1 December. The Third Army Air Service was established to be the air component of the United States Third Army. Units from the First Army AS contributed to over half the strength of Third Army AS, consisting of eight Aero Squadrons, and the headquarters of the III Corps Observation Group, and the VII Corps Observation Group.Series \\"P\\", Volumes 1 and 2, History of the 3d Army Air Service.

An order of precedence based upon length of service on the front had to be made, staging camps for processing the men and personnel, and ships had to be obtained for transporting the men and materiel back to the United States, consisting of men both in the Zone of the Advance (Western Front) as well as in the Services of Supply (Rear Areas). Demobilization of men and units proceeded, until finally, on 13 April 1919, orders were received from the Chief of the Air Service in France that the Headquarters, First Army Air Service was to demobilize. Six Aero Squadrons, amongst the last to arrive at the front, were to be sent to the Rhineland to reinforce or relieve units of the Third Army Air Service, the remainder to proceed to Colombey-les-Belles Aerodrome, France for demobilization.Series \\"C\\", Volume 4, 1st Army Air Service Periodic Operations Reports Operations Memorandum, Field Orders and Battle Orders.

It is located in a narrow valley along the Bukit Barisan mountains, among the Polan, Pari and Mato hills, approximately northeast of Padang. Coal was discovered in the mid-19th century by Willem Hendrik de Greve, and mining was pioneered in the area in 1876. The mine is known as the oldest coal mining site in Southeast Asia On 6 July 2019, Ombilin Coal Mine was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. History Coal was discovered in this area by Dutch engineer Willem Hendrik de Greve in 1868. Mining started at the open-pit mine in 1892 after the construction of a railway. In the pre-independence period, coal production peaked in 1930, at more than 620,000 tonnes a year. Prisoners/Kettingganger (Dutch for people in chains) from Java and Sumatra who were transported to the mining site with their legs, hands and necks in chained up, were the main laborers of the mine.Coal production in this mining area was able to fulfill 90 percent of the Dutch East Indies‚Äô energy needs. In 1942‚Äì1945, the mine was controlled by Japan, and the glory of the mine declined also. In 1945‚Äì1958, the mine was managed by the directorate of mining and in 1958‚Äì1968, by the bureau of state mining companies. In 1968, it became the Ombilin production unit of the state coal mining company. Production peaked in 1976 at 1,201,846 tonnes per year. Until 2002 it operated as an open-pit mine. After that, only underground mine continues operating. In recent times, CNTIC has invested $100 million to the mine.PT BUKIT ASAM TO EXPLOIT COAL IN OMBILIN WITH CHINESE FIRM., April 7, 2003 By 2008, the mine had estimated reserves about 90.3 million tonnes of coking coal, of which 43 million tonnes was mineable. The mine is owned by PT Tambang Batubara Bukit Asam (PTBA) and operated by the China National Technology Import-Export Corporation (CNTIC). The mine produces about 500,000 tonnes of coal per year.As of 2019, PT Bukit Asam coal mine company had halted operations in Ombilin. Coalmine Ombilin at Sawahlunto circa 1915. Tourists attraction The mining area continues to bring benefits to its constituents through reforestation of the former mining location and its conversion into a tourist destination. A well maintenance pit with sufficient lighting and air supply from blower attract local and foreign tourists mainly from Malaysia and Singapore. Seeing the pit cost Rp.30,000 (US$3.5) per person. There is Ombilin Coal Mining Museum at Ombilin Coal Mine Complex about the history of the company and the tools that were used for mining. Also there are still several original relics such as the Mbah Soero tunnel, workers and mine workers housing (Tangsi Baru and Field Land), coal filtering, railway factories, government offices, settlements, municipal government. The mining site has been transformed into a zoo, lake and horse-riding track.

They are known as the elder Kaas family and the younger Kaas family or named for their respective coats of arms (Sparre-Kaas and Mur- Kaas). Both families appeared in the middle ages, and they have been noble since time immemorial. Like all old noble families in Scandinavia, the families are untitled, although individual members in the past held the rank of knight, traditionally the highest rank of Scandinavian nobility and reserved for important statesmen, but always of a non-hereditary nature. History The elder family is descended from the knight Niels (born 1292). The elder family became extinct in 1799, while the younger family descends, through intermarriage in the late 15th century, from this family. The paternal ancestors of the younger family were also noble, but did not have a family name prior to the late 15th century, when they adopted the Kaas name from their mother's family. Nevertheless, the two families used different arms. The arms of the younger Kaas family is identical to that of the Reventlow family; for this reason it has been argued that the family is descended from the Reventlow family in the male line. Several members of both families were represented in the Danish Council of the Realm, and statesman Niels Kaas of the elder family was head of the Dano-Norwegian government during the King's minority in the late 16th century, and as such the de facto ruler of Denmark- Norway. Other family members were fiefholders or high-ranking military officers.

Other descendants of J√∏rgen Kaas are found in Norway, in particular in the families Huitfeldt, Nissen and Paus. Among J√∏rgen Kaas' descendants are also members of several royal houses, including Augusta Victoria, German Empress, King Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden, King Constantine II of Greece, Queen Sof√≠a of Spain, the current head of the House of Gl√ºcksburg Christoph, Prince of Schleswig-Holstein, the current head of the House of Hanover Prince Ernst August of Hanover and the current head of the House of Hohenzollern Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia. =Munthe-Kaas= A Norwegian branch, Munthe-Kaas, is descended from sergeant Herman Kaas (1730‚Äì93). His son, goldsmith in Christiania Ahasverus Kaas (1791‚Äì1859) applied for permission to change his name to Munthe-Kaas in 1848; however he was not himself descended from the Norwegian Munthe family. This Norwegian branch is very distantly related to the Danish Kaas family; the last common (patrilineal) ancestor of the two family branches was Erich Mogensen (Kaas) (ca. 1500‚Äì1556). The Norwegian Kaas family was far less prominent than the Danish Kaas family and did not own substantial land or achieve high rank in Norway; its members lived mainly as farmers, NCOs and junior military officers before the 19th century, and the family did not petition the Storting for recognition of its noble status in 1824 when the Nobility Act abolished the noble privileges in Norway.

She published various works on astronomy and navigation, founded an academy for the teaching of these subjects, and ran a warehouse focused on the distribution, production and repair of navigational instruments. Her Academy was highly regarded and recommended by the East India Company, Trinity House, and the Admiralty. In recognition of her work, she was awarded medals by the Kings of Prussia and the Kings of the Netherlands, and her rule for calculating latitude from altitudes was described as \\"ingenious\\". Taylor was one of the very few women working as a scientific instrument maker in London in the 19th century. Her \\"Mariner's Calculator\\", patented in 1834, was dismissed by the Admiralty.  Biography  Taylor was born in Wolsingham to Reverend Peter Ionn and Jane Deighton, being the fourth born of the family of eight. Her father was master of the Free Grammar School, which was one of the few north county schools that included navigation in its curriculum, and he allowed Jane Ann to attend both the basic grammar school and theoretical navigation tuition. After her father's death, Jane Ann continued her education with theoretical navigation studies. Her father's passing left her with a good fortune, which she invested wholeheartedly into a career in nautical education, a male dominated field at the time. When she married George Taylor, a widower with three children, in 1831, she became a stepmother and changed her name to Janet. They moved north of Theobald's Road in London and this is where Janet decided to start her first nautical academy in 1833. This academy was strictly made for merchant service officers. During this time period she published \\"Luni-Solar and Horary Tables,\\" which discussed calculations that were able to \\"reduce the lunar distance\\" that used a formula she derived herself. She continued her path in navigation and in 1834 received a patent for her invention of a Mariner's Calculator. The invention did not get approved by Admiralty, deeming it unworthy for the Lordships Patronage. Later on, she published a second edition of the book, \\"Principles of Navigation Simplified.\\" Though, the cost of creating the second edition of this book and the Mariner's Calculator put her in a place where she was slowly draining her capital. Afterwards, she spent some time working on the formula she derived for her first published book to further improve it. Around the mid-1835, she had a child. After the improvement on the formula she derived for some time she was able to publish the third edition of the \\"Luni-Solar and Horary Tables,\\" which was made possible by the donations of the Admiralty, Trinity House, and the Honorable East India Company, to all of whom she dedicated the book too. She owed much of this success to the hydrographer Francis Beaufort, who helped push for the acceptance of her work by the Naval establishment. The increase in fortune from the bookselling allowed the Taylors to move to No 103 Minories, and this is where they set up a \\"navigational warehouse.\\" This success meant Taylor was increasingly recognised as a credible mathematician and entrepreneur. For some years after, she continued to edit her book, later renamed to \\"Lunar-Solar and Horary Tables\\" selling a total of seven editions. The last print appeared in 1854. Also, she completed twelve editions of an \\"Epitome of Navigation,\\" with the last edition appearing in 1859. George Taylor ended up taking up the publishing parts of the enterprise in order for Janet to devote time to raising the children and continuing her writing. In 1843, Taylor decided to change her focus on compasses in iron ships. She worked specifically with the astronomer George Biddell Airy, who later would recommend her name to anyone who would be able to utilize her efforts. In 1845, she appointed William Reynolds to develop a nautical instrument factory in her name, resulting in instruments being entered in the Great Exhibition 1851 and the International Exhibition of 1862. A series of unfortunate events fell upon her, first starting with her husband George Taylor' death in 1853, and then both of her senior employees leaving her to start their businesses. From 1860, Taylor began to receive a Civil List Pension of ¬£50 per year, and around this year her nautical academy changed its name to Mrs Janet Taylor and Co, meaning that it had turned into a company. There is record of her paying land tax for her company up until 1866 but by 1870 she became ill. During this time she was with her sister Joyce and her husband the Rev. Matthew Chester. On the 26th of January in 1870, Mrs. Janet Taylor died of bronchitis. On her death certificate, her occupation is stated as \\"Teacher of Navigation.\\" Works *Lunar Tables for Calculating Distances *Luni-Solar and Horary Tables *Principles of Navigation Simplified *Epitome of Navigation References Further reading  External links * Category:1804 births Category:1870 deaths Category:English astronomers Category:Women astronomers ","title":"Janet Taylor"},{"id":"40066477","text":"Samasundara Palem is a village in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh.

Manga artist Norifusa Mita said he was satisfied with the Korean adaptation because \\"the characters have depth,\\" calling the series \\"energetic and entertaining.\\" The high school drama reached viewership ratings of 26.8% and topped its timeslot for most of its run. Yoon reunited with Master of Study director Yoo Hyun-ki for Brain (2011-2012), saying they chose the topic of neurosurgery because they wanted to tell a story about the human mind. In order to write realistic episodes, Yoon spent two months at a hospital interviewing doctors, nurses and patients. On set, a professor of neurosurgery and a head nurse with 27 years of experience also served as consultants. The series was actor Shin Ha-kyun's first network drama in eight years and his portrayal of an arrogant and ambitious second-year fellow striving to succeed to overcome his underprivileged background brought him critical praise and renewed mainstream popularity, winning him the Daesang (\\"Grand Prize\\") at the 2011 KBS Drama Awards.

She worked side by side with Porter for 25 years, at the National Institute for Medical Research, St Mary's Hospital and in the Medical Research Council Immunochemistry Unit, and played a major role in him being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1972. Early life and education Elizabeth Press was born on 5 October 1920 at 85 Crawford Street, Marylebone, London, the only child of Sydney George Press, the manager of a zinc and plumbing business, and Hilda Marian Press (n√©e Hall), who was a ladies‚Äô maid before marriage. Press was 19 years old when the Second World War started, and joined the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS, \\"the Wrens\\"). After the war, she obtained a BSc in Chemistry at Queen Mary College, London, and had research experience at the Middlesex Hospital Medical School. Career On 1 October 1955, Press joined Rodney Porter‚Äôs research group at the National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London. Her studies on antibodies were important in determining the chain structure, and particularly the observation that more than one gene was involved in coding for antibodies. Her work led to Porter's Nobel Prize in 1972, together with Gerald Edelman. The structural studies on antibodies were essential in the chain of scientific discoveries which led to the development of monoclonal antibodies by C√©sar Milstein, and led to the subsequent development of monoclonal antibodies which are now widely used as treatment for many cancers. Science described Press as \\"a 'major' yet largely unknown contributor to the field of immunology\\". Although she only had a BSc herself, Press supervised the PhD research of others, including Nancy Hogg, now a group leader at Cancer Research UK. The chain structure of antibodies Press's work provided the first evidence that immunoglobulin heavy chains had variable regions similar to those observed in light chains, and identified a particularly variable segment, now known as complementarity-determining region 3. Her research also pointed to evidence that at least two genes are involved in the synthesis of the heavy chain.

She was one of the first women to be appointed lecturer in a university, in addition to writing philosophy, literature and literary criticism. Biography Ellen M. Smith was born in the Village of Geddes, New York to Harriet H. Rowland and Edwin R. Smith, the eldest of their four children. She graduated from the Cortland Academy, Homer, N.Y. in 1860, with a major in Classics. Ellen, also, taught school in Syracuse. During the Civil War her brother, Edwin R. Smith, Jr., served in New York's 149th Regiment. Edwin was killed in the Battle of Chancellorsville, May 3, 1863. He was initially reported severely wounded; the family tried to determine whether the Confederates had captured him and treated him in the Confederate field hospital at Ellwood Manor. However, Edwin was lost without a trace. Ellen adopted the nom de plume \\"Ella Ellwood\\" in identification with Edwin, writing with the name Ellwood during the war. Following Edwin's death, Ellen resigned her teaching position in Syracuse and moved to Cairo, Illinois, where she lived with her uncle, Ward L. Smith and his wife, Anna. During the war, Ellen moved to St. Louis, Missouri. She wrote for the Missouri Republican newspaper of St. Louis, continuing to use the nom de plume Ella Ellwood until the war's end. She married St. Louis attorney and Union civil war veteran Joseph W. Mitchell in the Presbyterian Church of Alton, Illinois in September, 1867. Alton, Illinois had been, before the war, a primary source of advocacy for abolition of slavery, and was the location of the murder of the influential abolitionist advocate, the Presbyterian minister Rev. Elijah P. Lovejoy, and the destruction of his printing press by a pro-slavery mob from St. Louis. The marriage of Ellen and Joseph was, thus, their consecration to the union cause. While in St. Louis, she attended the Hegelian philosophy lectures which had been organized there by William T. Harris. She and Joseph also contributed to a literary and philosophical discussion group called \\"The Pen & Pencil Club,\\" often hosting the meetings in their home. Ellen and Joseph moved to Denver, Colorado in 1878, seeking effective treatment for Joseph's illness (possibly tuberculosis). However, Joseph died in February, 1879. Ellen remained in Denver, where she taught school and, then, lectured on philosophy and literature in the University of Denver. Also, she actively contributed to the Kant Club, and to the Fortnightly Club, of Denver. Mitchell attended the first session, in July 1879, of the Concord Summer School of Philosophy, which was hosted in Concord, Massachusetts. by Bronson Alcott on his property. William T. Harris organized the school and its programs after leaving St. Louis, with the intention of unifying the Hegelian Idealism of the St. Louis Philosophical Society with the Transcendentalism of Concord. At that first 1879 session, Ellen became acquainted with many women from across the country who were leading the struggle for women's suffrage, as well as the efforts to improve educational and social policy standards. Among those she met while attending the 1879 Concord session was Julia Ward Howe who, later, became the president of the Association for the Advancement of Women. The Concord School played an important role in helping to build networks of policy reformers; more than one half of those who attended were women. Mrs. Mitchell participated in the annual Concord School of Philosophy every year, until its final session in 1888. She wrote, in 1880, a description of the lectures during the previous session, and she delivered a paper titled \\"Friendship in Aristotle's Ethics\\" during the Concord session of July, 1887. Mitchell actively contributed to the Association for the Advancement of Women, regularly attending the annual congresses. At the 12th Woman's Congress in 1884, held at Baltimore, she delivered a paper titled \\"A Study of Hegel.\\" By the A.A.W.'s 13th Congress, held at Des Moines, Iowa, she was Vice Pres. of the A.A.W. for Colorado. At that same 13th Annual Congress, Prof. Maria Mitchell, of New York, and Ellen M. Mitchell, of Chicago (Mrs. Francis Mitchell) also were serving the A.A.W. as V.P.'s for the states of New York and Illinois, respectively. At the A.A.W.'s 18th Women's Congress, at Toronto in 1890, Mitchell delivered a paper titled, \\"The Dramas of Henrik Ibsen.\\" Continuing as V. P. of the A.A.W. for Colorado, she was \\"Chairman\\" of the A.A.W.'s Committee for Topics and Papers. For the A.A.W.'s 19th Woman's Congress in 1891, at Grand Rapids, Mich., she continued serving as V.P. for Colorado, as the Chair of the Topics & Papers Committee, and she delivered a paper titled \\"The Real and the Ideal in Art.\\" Throughout her career, Mitchell advocated, and endeavored to realize, the noble aspiration for American philosophy which was advocated by Walt Whitman in his great poetic essay manifesto of 1871, \\"Democratic Vistas\\". After 1893, she permanently returned to Geddes (by then a part of Syracuse) to care for her parents. In Syracuse, she organized and led the Round-Table of Syracuse, a literary and philosophical community adult seminar group. The Round Table began in 1894 and continued for more than 20 years. To assist the participants in their studies and discussions, Mitchell wrote and privately published a series of essays on Dante, Tennyson, and Goethe. The title for one of the essays, \\"The Way of the Soul\\" is adapted from Hegel's introduction to his Phenomenology of Spirit. In her introduction to the essay, she wrote:‚Äî Mitchell died in Syracuse, N.Y. May 14, 1920 at the age of 81, three months before the 19th amendment to the constitution was ratified, finally establishing universal suffrage. She is interred beside her parents in the Myrtle Hill Cemetery of the Village of Geddes. In her obituary, May 16, 1920, the Syracuse Herald newspaper commented: \\"The Herald records with sincere regret the death of Mrs. Ellen M. Mitchell, for many years the gentle preceptor and oracle of the Syracuse Round Table. The value of her services to the literary life of the city cannot easily be overestimated....Mrs. Mitchell's personality was singularly lovable, and it imparted a magnetic charm to her discourse and her teaching. On its intellectual side the City of Syracuse is much the poorer by her death.\\" Philosophy \\"A Study of Greek Philosophy\\", Mitchell's book length philosophical discussion, was published in 1891 by S.C.Griggs & Co. The book contains 36 chapter essays, chronologically presenting the development of the classical Greek tradition in philosophy, extending from the pre-Socratics to the neo-Platonists. Her book is the first book length philosophical analysis to have been written in America by a woman scholar. It guides university students, philosophy specialists, educators, and adult scholars through a program of study of the ancient Greek tradition in philosophy. The book is, also, the first book to preserve the legacy of ancient Greek philosophy in the New World. In her introduction to her book, Mitchell wrote:‚Äî Reviews of the book were offered by prominent scholars and thought leaders when it was published in 1891: * Dr. W.T. Harris, U.S. Commissioner of Education: \\"It shows on every page evidence of scholarship in the best lines, and of real insight into the questions discussed.\\" * S.H. Howison, Prof. of Philosophy, University of California, Berkeley: \\"I am deeply gratified to read in English, at last, a work on the great Greek thinkers that does not 'condescend' toward them as if they were infantile minds compared with moderns, but brings to convincing light the truly permanent value of their thinking.\\" * Edmund Clarence Stedman: \\"This survey, with its analysis of the Greek schools, is the most clear and inclusive, as far as my knowledge extends, that has been made in our language within so compact a space. It is of genuine value.\\" * Prof. Louis J. Block, Chicago: \\"Admirable in spirit and excellent in matter. I do not know where a clearer and more useful history of Greek philosophy is to be found.\\" * Frank Sanborn, in Springfield Republican: \\"There is probably no manual better than this for those who would begin the study of the Greek masters, and yet the book lacks the dryness of manuals and has an interest for all thoughtful readers.\\" * Caroline K. Sherman, in Chicago Herald: \\"This is no superficial hand-book giving a hasty survey of Greek thought - no condensed, simplified form of a larger treatise. It is a careful study from original sources of the great thinkers of antiquity, and it is presented to willing students in a form that will tempt them to go likewise to the same original sources.\\" * Science, New York: \\"This work is written in an earnest, serious spirit, and with an evident desire to present the truth as the writer understands it. It is impartial too as between the different schools of thinkers, none of them being slighted, and no decided preference shown for one over another except as their real importance demands it.\\" * Vouga's Art Folio, New York: \\"The work is comprehensive, and the author has, in a clear compact manner, given a place to each school, following the sequences in a style likely to impress the readers most forcibly, while the explanations and deductions show a most thorough and careful study of a complex and sometimes confused subject.\\" * Review of Reviews, New York: \\"This little work is an interesting, valuable, and very comprehensive view of the whole course of Greek philosophic thought.\\" * The Scotsman, Edinburgh: \\"The book is one from which the general readers can gather a clear idea of the drift of Greek thought, its subject-matter and development, which will serve as an excellent groundwork for further study.\\" * The Methodist Review, Volume 52 (1892): \\"The value of philosophy is the basal assumption in the issue of the above volume. Because of its lofty range of inquiry, its thought discipline, and its search after the ultimate truth, it ranks among the chief studies that can occupy human attention. Greek philosophy also, from its antecedent and fundamental relation to the later philosophic systems, is a perpetual body of instruction. Its maxims have an enduring charm for men; its theories, if dissented from, are wisely conceived; its leaders are among the great schoolmasters of the world. In a circle of St. Louis women, where the study of Greek thought was undertaken under the lead of the present author, the book now considered had its origin. From the rise of philosophy in Greece, under the Ionians, to its close following Neo-Platonism the historic review here sweeps. The personality of many great leaders of Grecian thought-as Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and Zeno-is set forth with clearness; and the differing systems which they gave to their age and the world are traced with sufficient outline for the full understanding of the whole range of Grecian inquiry in those great centuries of intellectual activity. It is instructive in these days, when the materialistic is receiving its full share of notice at the expense of the ideal, to notice such a circle of learners as that which gave the present volume its origin; and in the published result of their philosophic pursuits a wider circle of readers should find enjoyment and edification.\\" * Julia Ward Howe, in Literary World, Boston: \\"Mrs. Mitchell's volume is evidently the work of one who loves philosophy for its own sake. No tiresome pedantry, no encyclopedic dryness is found in its pages, but an earnest desire to present the theme in a graphic and tangible form, which shall rather invite the reader to its further study than discourage him with a mass of difficulties not to be overcome. A wholesome, appreciative, intelligible book. The volume of some two hundred eighty pages represents wide reading and careful study. Its contents belong to that easy reading which does not come of easy writing, but of the endeavor on the part of the writer to make \\"the crooked straight and rough places plain,\\" an endeavor which cannot in this field be too highly commended. Mrs. Mitchell conveys much valuable information and suggestion in a small space, but does not fatigue the reader with overcrowding facts and statements. Rev. W.R. Alger, highly reputed as a student and lover of philosophy, contributes a brief paper on the \\"Claim and Charm\\" of his favorite pursuit.\\" William R. Alger, in his introduction to the book wrote, in part:‚Äî Mitchell focused her writings on the philosophy of history, philosophy of art, political ethics, transcendentalism, and Phidias and Plato. While lecturing at the Denver University she was one of the first to introduce women to idealist thought, the other being Marietta Kies. In ‚ÄúThe Philosophy of Pessimism‚Äù, she was one of the philosophers who resisted philosophical systems that grew out of the skeptical tradition. They were not interested in determining what is not true, possible, or real. She only believed in positive theories that relied on what God created, like nature rather than based on human reason and judgment, it was based on the God-given world. Mitchell was part of the idealist philosophers. One of her larger successes was ‚ÄúA Study of Hegel.‚Äù This seventeen page article did not discuss Hegel's theories in detail. It does discuss important issues for women; nature, art, and religion. There is a paragraph in the article that distorts Hegel's thought by using her own thoughts:‚Äî This conflicts with Hegel's belief as the mind must not be said to stand apart from the world as Mitchell here implies. This paragraph starts the same as Hegel's belief of communicating with the world through senses, but it changes to hers about how to gain the power of knowledge is through using these senses to your individual experiences in life. This shows that she did not always just state other philosopher beliefs, but also had her own philosophies. When it came to the person and society Mitchell said that someone being away from social order is impossible. She states that ‚Äúsocial institutions play a critical role in individual self-determination\\", meaning that in order to rise above, an individual must become a part of society to be able to rise above it. In her book A study of Greek Philosophy, she claims the object of knowledge in philosophy is the human spirit itself, and truth is a living process which develops and advances in the civilizing course of humanity. Later in the book it reveals that we gain self-knowledge as we gain more experiences in life that affects our knowledge and become who we are.

Fak. der Universit√§t Jena) Felix Auerbach (12 November 1856 ‚Äì 26 February 1933) was a German physicist.  Life  Auerbach was born in Breslau (today Wroc≈Çaw) on 12 November 1856. His father, Leopold Auerbach, was a respected physician and professor of medicine at the University of Breslau. His mother was Arabella Auerbach, n√©e Hess. From her, he acquired the talent and love for music that accompanied him throughout his life. Felix was the eldest of six siblings. The chemist, Friedrich Auerbach (1870-1925), and Wroclaw pianist, Max Auerbach, (born 1872), were his younger brothers. Felix Auerbach received his humanistic education from 1865 to 1873 at Mary Magdalene School in his home town. After leaving school, at the age of 16, he went to study at the universities of Breslau, Heidelberg - with Gustav Robert Kirchhoff - and Berlin - with Hermann Helmholtz. Under Helmholtz, he received his doctorate in 1875. The title of his dissertation The nature of vocal sounds demonstrated his interest in the physics of music and acoustics. In 1879, Felix Auerbach became an assistant to Oskar Emil Meyer at the physics department of the University of Wroclaw and in 1880 he became a lecturer there. In 1883, he married Anna Silbergleit (1860-1933), later a board member of the Central German Women's Union and campaigner for women's suffrage. The marriage remained childless. In 1889, Auerbach took over the professorship of theoretical physics at the University of Jena which had been established by Ernst Abbe. As a Jew he was initially refused a full professorship; it was not until 1923 that this was granted to him. He became professor emeritus in 1927. From 1906 to about 1914, with his sister-in-law, K√§the Auerbach (1871-1940), he took on the education of the children of his brother, Max Auerbach: Klaus, G√ºnther, Johannes and Cornelia (later wife of Hanning Schr√∂der).  Artistic salon  The Haus Auerbach By 1914, Auerbach was already a patron of the Jena art scene. Numerous artists such as Erich Kuithan, Clara Harnack (the widow of Otto Harnack), Reinhard Sorge, Eberhard Grisebach and Botho Graef, the sponsor of Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, frequented his house. In Jena, he supported the progressive aspirations of the Jena Art Association and the Weimar Bauhaus. In 1925, Walter Gropius built a house on the principle of \\"large-scale building blocks\\" for Auerbach and his wife. The Auerbach House, as it is still called today, was restored in 1995. Until 1933, it was a cultural centre for artists and scientists. Besides Gropius, Max Bruch, Ida and Richard Dehmel, Edvard Munch, Henry van de Velde and Julius Meier-Graefe were among Auerbach's frequent guests and friends. As early as 1906, Munch had painted a portrait of Felix Auerbach (now in the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam).  Death  The rise of Adolf Hitler and the anti-Semitic climate in Germany made life unbearable for Felix and Anna Auerbach. After the Nazis seized power, both took their own lives. In his suicide note he stated that they \\"left the earthly life full of joy, after nearly 50 years of mutually blissful cohabitation\\". They died in Jena on 26 February 1933.  Works  Auerbach was a versatile scientist who never lost sight of the practical. At the University of Jena, he specialised in experimental physics. He worked on magnetism, which was also the topic of his habilitation thesis. He wrote a treatise on hydrodynamics for the Venetian Academy of Sciences. He also investigated the hardness of solid materials and in 1890 developed an instrument to measure absolute hardness. Horst Bredekamp made mention in Die Zeit that the art historian Ulrich M√ºller had written that the Jena Professor of Physics, Felix Auerbach \\"was able to explain Einstein's Theory of Relativity in two papers, dated 1906 and 1921, and in particular impressed a number of artists because he had dealt with a physics of the arts for decades.\\" Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky, who Gropius had brought in as a teacher at the Bauhaus in Weimar, were two of these artists. Together with physicist Wilhelm Hort (1878-1938), Auerbach began, as a septuagenarian, the publication of the Handbuch der physikalischen und technischen Mechanik (\\"Handbook of Physics and Engineering Mechanics\\", 1927-1931, 7 vols). In addition to his physical work Auerbach had a particular interest in mathematics. One of his classic works was Die Furcht vor der Mathematik und ihre √úberwindung (\\"The Fear of Mathematics and Conquering It\\", 1925). In his work Das Gesetz der Bev√∂lkerungskonzentration (\\"The Law of Population Concentration\\") Auerbach describes a law relating to the wide distribution of city sizes, which is now known as Zipf's law.

Plot When everything you believed in for your entire life turns out to be a devastating lie, then will you direct your anger at the person who caused it all or forgive that person? This drama tells a story about people who are hell-bent on recovering what they think is rightfully theirs while on the opposite side, there are people who will fight to protect what belongs to them. In the beginning, the two sides hate each other's guts. They do despicable things that will make it impossible to ever make things right again. But there is still a sliver of hope. The pent-up anger within themselves softens and they begin a path of rehabilitation and redemption that will allow them to forgive their enemies and bury the hatchet. This drama is not a story about revenge and anguish but a story of rehabilitation and harmony. Viewers will empathize with their agony and pain while also rejoicing at their happiness.

Yangel‚Äôs initiative, a new academic division was founded in Dnepropetrovsk: the Sector for Problems in Technical Mechanics, as a part of the Dnepropetrovsk Branch of the Institute of Mechanics of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (Ukrainian SSR)‚Äôs Academy of Sciences. The next stage in the institute‚Äôs history came in April 1968, when the Sector was reorganized into the Dnepropetrovsk Division of the Institute of Mechanics of the Ukrainian SSR‚Äôs Academy of Sciences. Vsevolod A. Lazaryan, Corresponding Member (from 1972 Academician) of the Ukrainian SSR‚Äôs Academy of Sciences, was appointed Head of Division. In June 1968, the physics and metallurgy departments of the former Branch of the B Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering of the Ukrainian SSR‚Äôs Academy of Sciences were joined to the Division. The scope of research at the Division grew from year to year, thus calling for the establishment of new departments. In February 1970, the research department of propulsion systems dynamics was established under the leadership of Viktor V. Pylypenko, D.Sc., with the task of augmenting the linear theory and devising a nonlinear theory of pogo self-oscillations of space vehicle structures, developing methods of dynamic characterization of liquid- propellant rocket engines and their components, and studying the dynamics of engine feed systems and transient regimes with consideration for cavitation in the centrifugal pumps with an inducer. In 1973, the Sector for Problems in Space Engineering was structurally singled out at the Division. Until 1980, the sector was headed by Vasily S. Budnik, Academician of Ukrainian SSR‚Äôs Academy of Sciences. In May 1980, the Division was transformed into the Institute of Technical Mechanics of the Ukrainian SSR‚Äôs Academy of Sciences. The institute was headed by Viktor V. Pylypenko, Corresponding Member of the Ukrainian SSR‚Äôs Academy of Sciences (now Academician of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine), D.Sc., Professor. At the institute, a number of laboratories were organized and equipped with up-to-date testing facilities: laboratories of hydrodynamics, plasmadynamics, vacuum and aerodynamic engineering, dynamic testing, strength, high energy, and electroforming; a controlled flow gas-dynamics system; a system to study detonation solid-propellant rocket engines and gas generators; a high-pressure system for rocket nozzle testing, etc. To further develop, coordinate, and improve organization of R&D;‚Äôs in space engineering in Ukraine, the Presidium of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and the National Space Agency of Ukraine issued in 1993 a joint decree-order, according to which the Institute of Technical Mechanics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine was given the status of dual subordination and its lines of research were modified to solve scientific and technical problems involving the development and operation of current and prospective space hardware. In 1995, the institute became the leading institute of the Ukrainian space sector. The institute provides scientific and technical support to the execution of the projects of the National Space Programs of Ukraine and coordinates R&D;‚Äôs in space engineering under the supervision of the National Space Agency of Ukraine.  Scientific directions of the Institute of Technical Mechanics  At present, fundamental and applied research are conducted at the institute. Those involve: the dynamics of mechanical and hydromechanical systems, of launch vehicle systems, and of rail and motor transport; the aero-thermo and gas dynamics of power plants and flying and space vehicles and their subsystems; the strength, reliability, and optimization of mechanical systems, launch vehicles, and spacecraft; the mechanics of interaction of a solid with ionized media and electromagnetic radiation; the systems analysis of trends and prospects in space engineering.

The students wanted to design and construct a single-seat formula car, and to participate in the Formula S.A.E competition. The team started from scratch, with only the basic knowledge from their university classes. Establishment Initially, the team relied on a theoretical approach to the car parts and familiarity with the team‚Äôs basic design program, SolidWorks. However, the practical application of those theories proved more challenging, and during construction, multiple problems arose including finances, mechanical failures and red tape. Achievements 2011 Varano de' Melegari The team‚Äôs first appearance in a competition was in the Formula A.T.V Italy in class 3 at Varano de‚Äô Melegari in Italy, near the city of Parma. The team was ranked first out of four universities. The competitors were teams from Italy, France and India; these countries had participated in previous competitions. 2012 Silverstone The Centaurus Team participated in its second competition at the Silverstone Circuit, UK. This was the team‚Äôs first appearance in a class 2 competition. In the final rankings, the team was placed ninth out of a total of 23 teams. More specifically, the team was classified third in design, fifth in business presentation and 12th in the cost and sustainability report.
