In terms of cultural assimilation there is a wide spectrum of experience: from Japanese immigrants who have made London their permanent home to company employees and their families transferred on short-term assignments whose social networks are often limited beyond the Japanese expatriate community. In 2001 over half of people born in Japan who lived in Britain had their homes in Greater London. History Japanese people have been visiting and living in London since the early 1860s: the First Japanese Embassy to Europe arrived in 1862 and the Ch≈çsh≈´ Five, students from the Ch≈çsh≈´ domain who studied at University College London, arrived in 1863. In June 1879 Mitsui & Co. established its London office and by 1884 there were 264 Japanese residents registered in Britain. Shipping and trade links between the two countries grew in the wake of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance signed in 1902 and Britain's Japanese population reached a prewar peak in 1935 of 1,871. In the 1970s and 1980s the Japanese population resident in the United Kingdom grew rapidly reflecting the growing strength of the Japanese economy and the decision of many Japanese firms to set up their first European manufacturing and operational hubs in the country. The majority of Japanese corporate offices were located in London and the South East of England and Japanese grade schools and social facilities developed to support this community. In 1994 54,415 Japanese nationals were registered as living in the United Kingdom, 38,000 of which were concentrated in the Greater London area. Geography Residential centers of the Japanese community in London have traditionally included areas such Acton, Finchley and Croydon, proximate to Japanese language based grade school and weekend language programs provided in these areas. Based on fieldwork conducted in the early 1990s, Junko Sakai (ÈÖí‰∫ï È†ÜÂ≠ê Sakai Junko) observed that at the time there was no particular location for the Japanese community in London, but that the families of Japanese \\"company men\\" had a tendency of living in North London and West London.Sakai, Page unstated (PT67). \\"Although the Japanese have no precise geographical location for their community, they are connected with each other personally, and one of their geographical centres is the Japanese school in London, previously in North London and now in West Acton.\\" In 1991, according to The Economist, lower-ranked Japanese workers tended to live in Croydon. The newspaper stated that Japanese middle managers had a tendency to live in Ealing, Finchley, and Golders Green. The Economist added that bosses of the Japanese offices lived in Hampstead and St John's Wood.\\"Britain: Japanese Spoken Here.\\" The Economist. 14 September 1991. Volume 320, Issue 7724, p. 67. . CODEN ECSTA3. Accession number 00541106, 00898348. Available on ProQuest, Document ID 224204538. \\"Once here, they look for a location that reflects their position in the social pecking-order: Around London it is St John's Wood and Hampstead for bosses; Finchley, Golders Green and Ealing for middle managers; Croydon for lower ranks.\\" and \\"London has more than 60 Japanese restaurants and eight Japanese food shops to stave off the torments of English food.\\" Concentrations of Japanese residents support a greater density of Japanese restaurants and shops. The City of London hosts many Japanese insurance companies, banks, and security houses, and along with the Japanese businesses the City of London includes Japanese job agencies, interpretation and translation companies, and restaurants. Sakai states that the City of London is \\"perhaps\\" the \\"most important centre\\" of the London Japanese community. Retail=20th Century= Yamanaka & Co.'s premises at 127 New Bond Street Japanese owned stores and businesses have been operating in London since the late 19th century. Yamanaka & Co., a prominent Asian art dealership founded by Sadajir≈ç Yamanaka opened premises in New Bond Street in 1900 and was granted a Royal Warrant by George V in 1912. In 1913 Mikimoto opened its first cultured pearl boutique outside Japan. In 1993 when the expansion of the Japanese business community in London was at its height, Yaohan Plaza in northwest London was opened as a Japanese community targeted shopping centre.White, p. 89. The mall was subsequently sold in 1999 to a Malaysian company changing its name to Oriental City, and offering pan-East Asian food retail and a restaurant foodcourt. The centre was finally closed in June 2008. In the 1990s Sogo also operated an outlet close to Piccadilly Circus mainly catering to Japanese package tour groups. In the early 1990s according to the Economist magazine, London had eight Japanese food shops and over 60 Japanese restaurants. For much of the late 20th century retail establishments dedicated to serving the specific needs of the Japanese community in London remained relatively few in number reflecting both the smaller size of the overall Japanese population in the United Kingdom as well as the growing availability of Japanese retail products from established British retail outlets. =Current Retail= YO! Sushi retail venue, Paddington Station The changing tastes and demographics of the Japanese community in London and the growing embrace of Japanese food and culture in the United Kingdom has significantly altered the availability of Japanese fashion, homewares, specialist food products and restaurants in London. Large stores such Muji and Uniqlo have been long established in the UK; smaller independents such as tokyobike and CA4LA are also to be found. Supermarkets such as Waitrose and online shopping services now provide a wide range of Japanese specialist food and beverage products. The Piccadilly Circus area continues to support a number of smaller Japanese bookstores, food shops, restaurants, and travel service offices, the longest established being the Japan Centre first opened in 1978. Japanese retail food offerings in London, offering varying degrees of authenticity, include popular chains such as YO! Sushi and Wagamama as well as smaller independent restaurants such as Kanadya and Kirazu. Education Japanese School in London Japanese children in London attend a variety of schools including the Japanese School in London, Independent, and local state funded schools. The Japanese School and three Japanese government sponsored Saturday language programs in the Greater London area serve as geographical hubs for Japanese families with school age children. The Japanese School first opened as a supplementary school in 1965. Prior to the school's relocation to Acton in 1987, it was located in Camden, in a building now occupied by North Bridge House School.\\"Which School?\\" Truman & Knightley Educational Trust, 1989. p.

Some Japanese students in London attending secondary school go to other international schools, including The American School in London. In 2003 Paul White, author of \\"The Japanese in London: From transience to settlement?\\", wrote that \\"even company movers do not necessarily put their children through the Japanese schooling system in London\\". Sakai noted in her book that some Japanese families elected to send their children to British boarding schools and, in the case of university students, sought admission to \\"Oxbridge\\" (University of Oxford and University of Cambridge).Sakai, pages unstated PT67-PT68 Lifestyle Japanese corporate welfare systems in the early 1990s provided employees with rental accommodation options described as \\"comfortable\\", and Japanese company men and their families enjoyed \\"luxurious lives compared to Japanese settlers\\". Companies in the 1990s sometimes paid generous subsidies to employees sent abroad to provide housing, so there is a perception that their lives are more comfortable in London than back home.Sakai, pages unstated PT68 Institutions The Japanese Embassy is located on Piccadilly in central London.

Course and features The Buchan River rises below Blue Hill in a remote alpine wilderness area within the Alpine National Park, and flows generally south through the town of . The river is joined by the Murrindal River and eight minor tributaries, before reaching its confluence with the Snowy River near Lucas Point in the Shire of East Gippsland. The river descends over its course. At Buchan, the river is traversed by Gelantipy Road, and a little further to the east, the Buchan Orbost Road. Etymology The name Buchan is thought to be taken from the Aboriginal phrase bukkan bukkan or bukkan mungie, referring to bags made from grass. History=Aboriginal history= The traditional custodians of the land surrounding the upper reaches of the Buchan River are the Australian Aboriginal Bidawal and Nindi-Ngudjam Ngarigu Monero peoples; while in its lower reaches, the Gunaikurnai people identify the land surrounding Buchan as their traditional country. At Cloggs Cave near Buchan, evidence has been found of Aboriginal occupation in prehistoric times. =European history= Pastoralists first entered the area surrounding the town of Buchan in the late 1830s. Buchan Station, taken up in the 1840s, had a succession of owners. To the north were the Gelantipy and Black Mountain runs. There were small groups of Aboriginals in the area but their numbers declined rapidly after European settlement. In 1861, Rev. John Bulmer inspected land south of Buchan as a possible site for a mission station. When he moved to Lake Tyers, the remaining Aboriginals accompanied him there. Land settlement began in 1870, with the best land along the river quickly taken up. A township was proclaimed in 1873, taking its name from the station.

Known primarily from Australia, it has also been recorded from Brazil and India. It is a white-rot fungus that grows on rotting eucalyptus wood. Its main identifying feature is the lilac colour of the pore surface on the underside of the fruit body. Taxonomy The fungus was originally described by Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1839, who called it Polyporus lilacino-gilvus. The type specimen was found growing on charred wood in Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania). and sent to Berkeley through botanist Sir William Jackson Hooker, who was sent the specimens from collections made by Ronald Campbell Gunn. Berkeley considered the fungus to be allied with Polyporus gilvus, a species now known as Phellinus gilvus and classified in the Hymenochaetaceae. Mycologists have juggled the fungus to several different polypore genera in its taxonomic history: Mordecai Cubitt Cooke to genus Polystictus in 1886; Otto Kuntze to Microporus in 1898; Curtis Gates Lloyd to Trametes in 1915; and Jorge Eduardo Wright and J.R.Deschamps to Fomitopsis in 1975. Chinese mycologists transferred the species to the newly created genus Rhodofomitopsis in 2016. Description The fungus produces shelf-like fruit bodies, usually in diameter, attached directly to the substrate without a stipe. The caps have concentrically ridged surfaces, and are brown with lilac tints. The lilac-coloured surface of the cap underside has 4‚Äì5 pores per millimetre. The spore print is white; spores are smooth, ellipsoid, and measure 6‚Äì9 by 2‚Äì3 ¬µm. Habitat and distribution Rhodofomitopsis lilacinogilva is known primarily in Australia, where it is widely distributed, having been reported from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia, and Northern Territory. The fungus was reported from India for the first time in 2009, and from Brazil in 2015. Although not native to Europe, it was reported as an exotic species growing on imported eucalyptus wood sheet piling in a new housing estate in Groningen.

The film, originally titled Intramural, stars cast members of comedy groups Saturday Night Live, Derrick Comedy, BriTANicK, and Good Neighbor. The film was picked up by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Orion Pictures and was given a limited release on film and video on demand on June 19, 2015. Synopsis Caleb (Jake Lacy) is a fifth-year senior preparing to graduate. Not quite ready to settle into the life, expectations, and realities outside of his college, he decides that he wants to reassemble The Panthers, an intramural football team that had to shut down after one of the team members ended up getting partially paralyzed for life. Doing so is going to be far more difficult than he expected.

Jackson expressed his desire to have Andrew Disney direct the film, as he greatly enjoyed his work. Nikki Reed was later confirmed to be performing in the film, as were Beck Bennett and Michael Hogan. Jackson and Disney raised funds for the film through a successful Kickstarter campaign, and filming began on July 12, 2013 in Austin, Texas and continued for six weeks, ending on August 22, 2013. Release The film had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 19, 2014. The film went on to screen at the Montclair Film Festival on May 4, 2014. and the Seattle International Film Festival on June 6, 2014. The film was picked up by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Orion Pictures and was retitled Balls Out. The film was released in a limited release and video on demand on June 19, 2015. Reception The film was met with positive reviews from film critics. It currently holds an 80% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 15 reviews. Andy Webster of The New York Times praised the film for its self-aware humor and talented cast for having comedic timing, singling out Kate McKinnon as a standout, concluding that \\"she displays talent too vast for the small screen. Now watch her career rocket.\\" Nick Prigge of Slant Magazine gave a mixed review of the film, saying that it was at odds with itself of being either a straight sports film or a satire of the genre. Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly said that while there's some funny commentary on the absurdity of sports films he found the film less a feature film and more a long television sketch. It won both the Cinema Dulce Best of Fest and Best Actor (Jake Lacy) awards at the Hill Country Film Festival and the Best Guilty Pleasure Audience Award at the Seattle International Film Festival.

Donat began taking elocution lessons in 1918 (aged 12 years) after being enthralled by a recital performance of Dickens‚Äô ‚ÄòA Christmas Carol‚Äô given by Bernard in Rusholme, a suburb of south Manchester. Interviewed in 1934, Donat said modestly: ‚ÄòWhatever success I may have gained has been entirely due to James Bernard, my elocution teacher in Manchester, who taught me all I know. He pushed me into my first stage job, and has always given me every possible help a man could give.‚ÄôPicture Show, 19 May 1934: p.10.  Early life  James Bernard - full name, James Rudolph Bernhard von Schmoocke - was born in Chorlton upon Medlock, Manchester and died at his home in Withington (South Manchester). Little is known of his pre- recital years. As a young boy, he spent time with his uncle, James Lowe, in London and he worked for the Stockport Express in his youth. Bernard married Alexandra Oxley (1872‚Äì1944), the daughter of a local 'smallware manufacturer', 27 April 1915 at the Platt Unitarian Chapel, Fallowfield.  Career  Bernard had early ambitions for the stage. Interviewed in 1936, he said: 'It has been my fate, to be always associated with the stage but not on it. I have never fulfilled my early ambition, but I have taught many other people who have been successful.‚ÄôManchester Evening News, August 13, 1936. His role was to teach others and to fashion their early careers through his many friends and contacts in the theatre world. Those of his students who achieved success on the London stage included Reginald Tate (Prof. Bernard Quatermass in the BBC‚Äôs 1953 'The Quatermass Experiment'), David Olive, Veronica Turleigh, Emrys Jones, and Robert Donat.‚ÄòRobert Donat Papers‚Äô. Letter Nov 12, 1942 (Bernard to Donat) written on the back of an article from The Country House and Estate, December 1925, ‚ÄòMonth in the Dramatic World‚Äô. Bernard was a late example of a class of professional platform reciters and elocutionists who were in vogue throughout the English-speaking world during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Other notable examples of reciters are F. Matthias Alexander, originator of the Alexander Technique and Lionel Logue of The King's Speech - voice coach to King George VI.The King's Speech, Logue, M., Conradi, P. London: Quercus 2010. Bernard, fiercely resisted any suggestion that he was a voice therapist and, as society and fashions changed, his melodramatic acting style was seen as increasingly old-fashioned and unsuitable for the new media of sound and film. Bernard's art was a victim of a changing world and, in particular, the decline in demand for his services during the Second World War years. Michael Kennedy described him as an 'old- world figure' who harked back to the glory days of late Victorian and Edwardian actor-managers and, most of all, the supreme artistry of Sir Henry Irving 'for whom God is to be thanked for a divine gift,' Bernard wrote to Donat, 12 November 1942.'Robert Donat Papers', op cit. Bernard's teaching motto was 'Divide and master'. His methods were rigorous and practical: 'Efforts to train for public speaking, or indeed even for good private speaking, are largely wasted,' he wrote, 'unless the indivisible sounds are mastered one by one. Again, ‚ÄúDivide et Impera‚Äù'.Bernard, J., Twenty-Four Lessons in Elocution. Sir Isaac Pitman & Sons, Ltd., 1946, p. 24.

Bernard, himself, studied for many years with the actress and author, Rose Meller O‚ÄôNeill.Bernard 1946, p. 156 O'Neill wrote a book on the Delsarte System, Science & Art of Speech & Gesture (London: C. W. Daniel company 1927) that Bernard highly recommended - 'Buy, borrow, beg, or sell your bed to get a copy', Bernard wrote.Bernard 1946, p. 155 Donat remembered Bernard's insistence on clear enunciation and a resonant voice: ‚ÄúMy elocution teacher in Manchester was always reminding me to 'remember the bloke at the back who had paid his tanner,' and I have never forgotten it.‚ÄùPicture Show, op cit. He maintained his relationship with Robert Donat chiefly by letter throughout his life. The relationship was somewhat turbulent reaching a low point of 'estrangement' in May 1940, mainly due to Bernard's harking back to the past and his reluctance or inability to move on and accept Donat's artistic (and financial) success as a film star. But there was a reconciliation and they corresponded until a few weeks before Bernard's death. Bernard's latter years were dogged by pain and immobility (arthritis in both legs) but his reputation as a teacher was undiminished and his energy and perseverance for forging the best start for his talented pupils (he called them his ‚Äòpups') remained unabated to the very end. He is buried (unrecorded on headstone) in Philips Park Cemetery, Manchester with his wife. Bernard wrote two books, Twenty-Four Lessons in Elocution (1933), the second edition (1933, 1946) with a Foreword by Robert Donat and a companion volume, Dramatic Recitations and How to Deliver Them (1934) ‚Äì a dramatic ‚Äòreader‚Äô containing two 'original studies of character' by Bernard: ‚ÄòHe Wanted to be an Actor‚Äô (A Tragi-Comedy of Youth) and ‚ÄòThe Quack‚Äô (A Dramatic Episode).Bernard, J.

New Horizons Joseph Zaritsky Naan, The Painter and the Model, 1949 Israel Museum, Jerusalem Zvi Meirovich gouache 1961 70x50 cm Dov Feigin Growth, 1959 Ein Harod Mueeum of Art The Ofakim Hadashim art movement began with a group of artists who mounted an exhibition in Tel Aviv's Habima national theater in December 1942, under the name \\"The Group of Eight\\". The group evolved into a coherent artistic movement only after the founding of the state of Israel in 1948. Members of the school included Arie Aroch, Zvi Meirowitch, Avraham Naton (Natanson), Avigdor Stematsky and Yehezkel Streichman. The work of sculptor Dov Feigin also appeared in the catalog of the 1942 exhibition, though it was not displayed. In February 1947 five of the original members of the group joined Joseph Zaritsky for an exhibit called \\"The Group of Seven\\" at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.Gila Blass, New Horizons (Reshefim Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1980), pp. 16-17 (in Hebrew). Members of the group stated that \\"The group is based in modernism, especially French, yet seeks a unique style that expresses our own reality\\".Davar Ha-Shavua, 12 February 1947. For these artists, this was not only a statement of philosophy, but a practical work plan. Zaritsky, who served as chairman of the League of Painters and Sculptors in the Land of Israel, opposed the league's philosophy of equality among artists. In 1948, at the time of the opening of the artists' house that was to become the League's permanent home, he was delegated to select works for the Bienniale in Venice. His selections caused such an outrage among the members that he was ousted from his position. He walked out with a group of artists, and founded an alternative movement, the \\"New Horizons\\". On 9 November 1948, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art opened the first exhibit bearing the movement's name. Among the artists showing were Pinchas Abramovich, Marcel Janco, Aharon Kahana, Yohanan Simon, Avshalom Okashi and Moshe Castel, as well as movement founders Zaritsky, Streichman and Feigin. The group sought a style that reflected the striving for Zionism and Modernism. This style was largely dictated by the leading artists of the group - Zaritsky, Stematsky Mairovich and Streichman. In practice, this style was a variant of European modernism. The style has been called \\"lyrical abstract\\", but in fact, there was little purely abstract art, but rather works rooted in the local visual landscape. This essentially figurative style was pushed toward the abstract by bold brush strokes, and a strong use of bright colors typical of the \\"Land of Israel\\" style, reflecting the strong Mediterranean light. Formats were generally rather small, and the style was similar to European abstract art before the second World War, akin to the art of Wassily Kandinsky, and unlike the abstract art prevalent in the United States at the time. For example, in his series \\"Yehiam\\" (1949‚Äì1952), Zaritsky depicts scenes from the establishment of Kibbutz Yehiam in northern Israel. The early paintings in this series (mostly watercolors) depict the natural landscapes of the region, while the later paintings are (mostly oil) abstractions of these earlier scenes. This progression, contends art critic and curator Mordecai Omer, reflects Zaritsky's belief that external visual reality is the basis of artistic originality.Mordechai Omer, Zaritzky (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1984), p. 86. Zvi Meirovich, a prominent members of Okakim Hadashim he painted in the abstract lyric style but unlike his colleagues Mairovich was more inclined to a German rather than a French pallette. Hs bold use of black and reds particularly in the gouaches. The big breakthrough was in oil pastels, that only he made in large format. Using a deep space photo surface rather than a flat paper was pioneering moment. Others in the group, however, deviated from this style. Marcel Janco, of international fame for his involvement in the Dada movement in Europe in the 1930s, did not adopt this approach to abstraction; rather his art uses European Cubist and Expressionist styles to create a Jewish-Zionist narrative. Moshe Castel, also, went through a transformation during the 1950s from abstraction to expressionism characteristic of the Canaanist movement. In the field of sculpture, the group introduced new media. Yechiel Shemi, Dov Feigin, and, after a sojourn in Britain, Itzhak Danziger, introduced welded steel as a new medium. This new form freed these artists from the figurative character of stone and wood carving, for a more purely abstract oeuvre. Here, too, however, there is frequent reference to the Canaanite figurativeness and symbolism. Indeed, during the 1950s, the \\"New Horizons\\" group tended more and more toward the abstract, and away from reliance on the figurative. Zaritsky led this shift, which was rooted in what he saw as a guiding ideology. Some members of the group, however, rejected this ideology, and eventually quit the movement. These included Janco, Aharon Kahana and Yehiel Simon.See: Gila Blass, New Horizons, pp. 64-66. Realism and Social art While the abstract and secular works of the New Horizons group had profound influence on the course of art in Israel, they were nonetheless considered at the time to be on the fringes of mainstream art, which was mostly figurative and often bearing explicit Jewish and Zionist messages. This explicitly nationalist trend in Israeli art was denounced by its opponents as \\"regionalism\\".Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor- Friedman, The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art (Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), p. 10 (In Hebrew). New Horizon critics, who maintained that art was international and universal, were opposed by the ideology of the Bezalel School at the time. Mordechai Ardon, head of Bezalel, wrote in 1954, \\"Every artist, like every citizen, must serve his country in heart and in soul\\".Cited in: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008), p. 21 (In Hebrew). New Horizons artists, too, despite their avowed adherence to a philosophy of universality, often expressed in their works sentiments of nationalism, Zionism, and socialism. For example, Zaritsky, one of the leading ideologues of the universalist school, produced series of paintings focusing on Israeli kibbutzim - his series \\"Yehiam\\", and a similar series on Naan (a kibbutz in central Israel), 1950‚Äì1952. Both these series include abstractions of the Israeli landscape. Zvi Meirovich one of the founders of New Horizons produced a series of large oil paintings called Mizpe Ramon focusing on the Israeli deseret. Sculptor Dov Feigin produced \\"Wheat Sheaves\\" in 1956, and Dadaist Janco painted \\"Soldiers\\", \\"Air raid Alarms\\" and \\"Maabarot\\" (jerry-built communities housing new Jewish immigrants in the 1950s). Some of the New Horizons artists belonged to the \\"Center for Advanced Culture\\" run by the Socialist-Zionist youth movement \\"Hashomer Hatzair\\".See: Gila Blass, New Horizons, p. 29. This activity culminated in the founding of the artists' village Ein Harod by a group of artists headed by Janco. There, Janco hoped to found a new socialist and artistic utopia. Mordechai Ardon's work stands out from that of other New Horizons artists for dealing with the mystical and historical, rather than concentrating on the present. His canvases often depict episodes from Jewish history, from Biblical scenes to the Holocaust. In 1965 Raffi Lavie founded a group called \\"10+\\", which sought an alternative to the \\"lyric abstraction\\" of the New Horizons group.

SWIFTS technology is based on a near-field Lippmann architecture. An optical signal is injected into a waveguide and ended by a mirror (true Lippman configuration). The input signal interferes with the reflected signal, creating a standing, or stationary, wave. In a counter-propagative architecture, the two optical signals are injected at the opposite ends of the waveguide. The evanescent waves propagating within the waveguide are then sampled by optical probes. This results in an interferogram. A mathematical function known as a Lippmann transform, similar to a Fourier transform, is later used to give the spectrum of the light.  History  In 1891, at the Acad√©mie des Sciences in Paris, Gabriel Lippmann presented a colour photograph of the Sun's spectrum obtained with his new photographic plate.G. Lippmann: Compte Rendus de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences, Paris, 112 (1891), 274 Later, in 1894, he published an article on how his plate was able to record colour information in the depth of photographic grainless gelatin and how the same plate after processing could restore the original colour image merely through light reflection.G. Lippmann: Compte Rendus de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences, Paris (1894), 92 He was thus the inventor of true interferential colour photography. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908 for this breakthrough. Unfortunately, this principle was too complex to use. The method was abandoned a few years after its discovery. One aspect of the Lippmann concept that was ignored at that time relates to spectroscopic applications. Early in 1933, Herbert E. Ives proposed to use a photoelectric device to probe stationary waves to make spectrometric measurements.Herbert E. Ives, Standing light waves, repetition of an experiment by Wiener, using a photoelectric probe surface, JOSA, 1933, 23, pp. 73‚Äì83 In 1995, P. ConnesP. Connes, E. le Coarer, 3-D spectroscopy: The historical and logical viewpoint. IAU Colloquium, vol. 149, pp. 38‚Äì49, Marseille, 22‚Äì25 Mars 1994 proposed to use the emerging new technology of detectors for three-dimensional Lippmann-based spectrometry. Following this, a first realization of a very compact spectrometer based on a microoptoelectromechanical system (MOEMS) was reported by Knipp et al. in 2005,D. Knipp, Spectrometers shrink down, Nature Photonics, 2007, pp. 1, 8, 444 and 445 but it had a very limited spectral resolution. In 2004, two French researchers, Etienne Le Coarer from Joseph Fourier University and Pierre Benech from INP Grenoble, coupled sensing elements to the evanescent part of standing waves within a single-mode waveguide. In 2007, those two researchers reported a near-field method to probe the interferogram within a waveguide.E. le Coarer, S. Blaize, P. Benech, I. Stefanon, A. Morand, G. L√©rondel, G. Leblond, P. Kern, J.-M. Fedeli, P. Royer, Wavelength-scale stationary-wave integrated Fourier-transform spectrometry, Nature Photonics (2007), 1, 8, 473‚Äì478 The first SWIFTS-based spectrometers appeared in 2011 based on a SWIFTS linear configuration.  Technology principle  The technology works by probing an optical standing wave, or the sum of the standing waves in the case of polychromatic light, created by a light to be analyzed. In a SWIFTS linear configuration (true Lippman configuration), the stationary wave is created by a single-mode waveguide ended by a fixed mirror. The stationary wave is regularly sampled on one side of a waveguide using nano-scattering dots. These dots are located in the evanescent field. These nanodots are characterized by an optical index difference with the medium in which the evanescent field is located. The light is then scattered around an axis perpendicular to the waveguide. For each dot, this scattered light is detected by a pixel aligned with this axis. The intensity detected is therefore proportional to the intensity inside the waveguide at the exact location of the dot. This results in a linear image of the interferogram. No moving parts are used. A mathematical function known as a Lippmann transform, similar to a Fourier transform, is then applied to this linear image and gives the spectrum of the light. The interferogram is truncated. Only the frequencies corresponding to the zero optical path difference at the mirror, up to the farthest dots are sampled. Higher frequencies are rejected. This interferogram‚Äôs truncation determines the spectral resolution. The interferogram is undersampled. A consequence of this under-sampling is a limitation of the wavelength bandwidth to which the mathematical function is applied. SWIFTS technology displays the Fellgett's advantage, which is derived from the fact that an interferometer measures wavelengths simultaneously with the same elements of the detector, whereas a dispersive spectrometer measures them successively. Fellgett's advantage also states that when collecting a spectrum whose measurement noise is dominated by detector noise, a multiplex spectrometer such as a Fourier-transform spectrometer will produce a relative improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio, with respect to an equivalent scanning monochromator, that is approximately equal to the square root of the number of sample points comprising the spectrum. The Connes advantage states that the wavenumber scale of an interferometer, derived from a helium‚Äìneon laser, is more accurate and boasts better long-term stability than the calibration of dispersive instruments.

It is the directorial debut of Michael Mayer (◊û◊ô◊õ◊ê◊ú ◊û◊ê◊ô◊®). The film tells the story of the relationship between Roy, an Israeli lawyer, and Nimer, a Palestinian psychology student. The film was released commercially in Israel on 28 February 2013. The film has been accredited with 25 awards throughout its creation, which includes the Audience Award at the Berlin Jewish Film Festival in 2013, along with the FilmOut San Diego in 2013. Plot The film is set in Israel, and State of Palestine where State of Palestine student Nimer Mashrawi (Nicholas Jacob) is heading to Tel Aviv to meet his friend Mustafa N'amnais (Loai Nofi) at a gay bar. While at the bar, he meets a local Israeli lawyer named Roy Scheffer (Michael Aloni). The couple fall in love, though Nimer struggles with the reality of their relationship. Later in the story, Palestinian society rejects Nimer because of his sexual orientation, whereas initially Israeli society rejects him due to his nationality. The situation is made worse for Nimer when he realises his brother Nabil Mashrawi (Jamil Khoury) is hiding a weapon stockpile for his militant friends. Nimer is granted a student visa to study at a university in Tel Aviv, giving him more opportunity to see Roy. However, he is soon approached by the Israeli Secret Service who pressure him into becoming an informant by threatening to cancel his visa. Nimer refuses and his visa is cancelled. Unbeknownst to Nimer, Mustafa has been living illegally in Tel Aviv under a similar arrangement. When he is unable to provide any more information, he is forcibly deported back to the West Bank where he is immediately abducted by Nabil and his gang of extremists. Nimer is forced to watch as his friend is tortured and executed for being homosexual and an informant. Later, while going through Mustafa's phone, Nabil and his friends find a photo of Nimer. Despite their differences, Nabil lets Nimer escape rather than killing him. Nimer makes it to Roy's house and hides there. Meanwhile, Nabil's store of weapons is discovered by the authorities. He is arrested and the police search for Nimer as an accomplice. Unable to hide him forever, Roy convinces an underworld figure and client of his law firm to smuggle Nimer to France. Though he promises to meet him there in the future, Roy is arrested while distracting the police so Nimer can escape. Nimer makes it to his boat and sails away, unaware of what has happened to Roy.

He served nearly thirty years in the lower and upper houses of the colonial government, as both elected and appointed representative, government minister and chairman of committees. Jacob was born in Jessore, in the Bengal Presidency of British India (now in Bangladesh). He was the second surviving son of Captain Vickers Jacob (1789‚Äì1836) and his wife Anne (n√©e Watson, 1796‚Äì1836). Vickers Jacob reached the rank of captain in the Bengal Army of the East India Company, then became a merchant and landowner in the British colony of New South Wales. At the time of Archibald's birth, Captain Jacob had returned to India and was a jute planter and indigo merchant in Bengal. Archibald Jacob was orphaned in India at the age of seven by the untimely death of both his parents. His father died in Bengal in 1836 and was buried in Calcutta, and his mother Anne died later that same year in Hobart Town, Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania), while on her way back to Sydney with her younger children. Archibald and his younger brother Robert had been left behind in Calcutta, where they were boarders for a time at La Martiniere, a newly established Protestant private school, before sailing to England to be brought up and educated by his mother's relatives in Nottinghamshire and Cheshire. In 1851 Archibald and Robert made their way to Australia to take up family land holdings established there by Vickers Jacob in the 1820s, during the early settlement of the Hunter Valley north of Sydney. In 1853, at Raymond Terrace in that neighborhood, he married Mary Snodgrass (1830‚Äì1897), daughter of prominent local landowner and politician Colonel Kenneth Snodgrass. Jacob was elected as the member for Lower Hunter in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, and represented that district from 7 March 1872 until 9 November 1880. He succeeded Ezekiel Baker as Secretary for Mines in the Robertson Ministry in November 1877, retiring with his colleagues the following month, following the election that year. He then represented the Electoral district of Gloucester from 27 November 1880 until 23 November 1882. Jacob was nominated to the New South Wales Legislative Council on 9 October 1883, and was Chairman of Committees of that body. He was a member of the Council until his death. Archibald Jacob died in Ashfield, Sydney on 28 May 1900. He was survived by his wife Mary and five sons.

Through its sixty-one colored drawings and inscriptions in \\"comics' style\\" it tells the life story of Saint Hedwig of Silesia, spouse of the Silesian Piast duke Henry the Bearded, her family, and events related to her canonization (1267). The Hedwig Codex details both the married life of the Hedwig of Silesia and her life within the Cistercian nunnery of Trebnitz. This art piece, a fine example of Central European Gothic art, is valued especially for its depictions of the Tartar invasion of Europe (Silesia). History= Medieval Commission = The Hedwig Codex was commissioned by Ludwig I of Liegnitz with his wife, Agnes of Glogau. Ludwig I of Liegnitz was also Saint Hedwig's great-great-grandson. In spite of the manuscript being made a century after her demise, the codex has come to substitute for the holy saint, having a nearly relic-like status. The commission of the manuscript helped further establish a cult in Silesia that revered Saint Hedwig. Based on Hedwig's hagiography (), the illustrated codex was produced in 1353 at the court workshop of Hedwig's descendant, Duke Louis I of Legnica, in Lubin. Duke Louis, the vassal of the Bohemian king and from mother's side his relative, while from his father's side a member of the branch of the Polish royal Piast dynasty, wanted through this opus to contribute to celebration of his famous ancestor and family. The writer (or even illuminator?) of the manuscript was certain Nicolaus of Prussia (Nycolaus Pruzie).A colophon (closing inscription) on fol. 148r informs: Scripta est [legenda] autem per manus Nycolai Pruzie foris civitatem Lubyn (\\"Moreover, [the legend] was written by hands of ...\\"). = Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries = Upon the Protestant Reformation and the dissolution- secularization of the Brzeg collegiate chapter in 1534,More to the history of this institution in: the codex was moved to local gymnasium. During the devastating events of the Thirty Years' War the book was transferred to the town of Ostrov (Schlackenwerth) in western Bohemia (this country and Silesia were part of the same Crown at that time) where was subsequently, after 1671, kept at Piarist monastery. = Modern Provenance = Later, it was purchased by Jewish Gutmann family from Vienna. In 1938 Nazi authorities in Austria confiscated Gutmanns' art collection, yet previous owners regained the manuscript in 1947 and passed with it to Canada. For 19 years (1964‚Äì83) the manuscript had been returned to Europe again ‚Äì during that time a facsimile edition, edited by the German art historian Wolfgang Braunfels, was made and published (1972) in Berlin as Der Hedwigs-Codex von 1353 ‚Äì but finally, the J. Paul Getty Trust from USA has purchased it in 1983. The original manuscript is today part of the Getty Museum collection under the signature Ms. Ludwig XI 7. Duke Ludwig left the Hedwig Codex to Saint Hedwig in Brzeg, Poland. The manuscript was in Poland for about two-hundred and fifty years. The Hedwig Codex was passed around through Bohemia royalty until its donation to the monastery in the Czech Republic. Two Viennese art dealers got ahold of the manuscript in 1910 and sold it to philanthropist Ritter von Gutmann. The manuscript was then sold to H.P. Kraus from New York City until it was acquired by the Ludwig Collection located in Cologne. Less than a decade later, the Hedwig Codex was purchased by the J. Paul Getty Museum located in Los Angeles, California. The Hedwig Codex has been in thirty-six exhibitions since being in the J. Paul Getty Museum.  St. Hedwig  Hedwig of Silesia married Henry, the future Duke of Silesia, at the age of twelve and had seven children. She did not have much contact with her family, which was common for the upper aristocracy. When she became duchess, she only had contact with one member of her family, her brother Ekbert who was also the bishop-elect of Bamberg, Germany. Hedwig became a widow upon the death of her husband, retreating to the Cistercian nunnery of Trebnitz that she and her husband, Henry, had founded in 1202. Fourteen years later, Hedwig passed away, Hedwig of Silesia was canonized into a Saint. It was common for noble widows to retreat to a reputable convent in the medieval period. Even though Hedwig retreated to a convent, she never took vows to enter the order formally, due to the fact that she valued her freedom outside and inside the convent. Hedwig told her daughter Gertrude, who was the abbess of the convent, that she could not be officially bound to the order because she needed to look after the needs of Christ's poor in the world. Hedwig wanted to follow the duties Christ designated to his apostles which in return would grant her eternal life. By the year 1300 in Silesia, people began referring to Hedwig as patron saint of Silesia. Churches in Poland honored Hedwig by adding a feast day dedicated to her on their ceremonial calendars. Due to the large number of Silesian Catholics, King Fredrick the Great commissioned a church for Hedwig in the year 1740, known as St. Hedwig's Cathedrallocated in Berlin, Germany.  Purpose  The purpose of the creation of the Hedwig Codex was to celebrate and codify the canonization of Saint Hedwig of Silesia and to claim what was important in her life and sanctity. What interests art historians about the manuscript are its sixty-one tinted drawings which, unlike the text, were originals instead of copies. While the Hedwig Codex details the Saint's life, it does not provide eyewitness statements of the saint, only of the patron. The manuscript is meant to show the marital and penitential life of Saint Hedwig os Silesia. She lived a life of humility that transferred over to the iconography of the manuscript portraying her through maternal imagery. Saint Hedwig of Silesia was perceived as the mother of the poor and a source of comfort for widows and orphans.  Description = Design = The manuscript has a total of 204 folios. All of the drawings in the Hedwig Codex, with the exception of fol. 9v-12v, are included on single leaves. The material that the manuscript is made out of it red-stained pigskin. The manuscript uses tempera colors and is bounded in between wood boards. Many of the illustrations in the Hedwig Codex have figures on the side to represent witnesses and their appearance also represents the readers. By making the reader a proxy participant, the illustrations in the Hedwig Codex make the legend of Saint Hedwig of Silesia come to life. = Text and Script = The manuscript has a total of 204 folios, 128 of which are only text. The folios containing only text telling the story of Saint Hedwig of Silesia are known as vita maior and vita minor. The vita maior tells the long life of the Saint while the vita minor is shorter containing prayers, sermons, and about her canonization. The manuscript has a large text script in order to make up for the large size of the manuscript. The manuscript has twenty-four lines on each page which makes it simply legible. Since the manuscript was written by only one scribe, Nycolaus Pruzia, it's an indicator of the conceptual unity of the manuscript.  Interpretation  The Hedwig Codex shows Saint Hedwig of Silesia praying, performing miracles, and giving back to those in need. The manuscript is seen as a symbol of female devotion while also sharing the life of the duchess of Silesia. At the beginning of the manuscript, Hedwig's family tree is depicted in folio 9v and folio 10r, which can be interpreted as a symbol of the political climate the country was enduring. Ludwig I who commissioned the codex, omitted Anna of Sv√≠dnick√° who was Hedwig's great- great-great-granddaughter and Ludwig's cousin, as well as St. Elizabeth of Hungary, Hedwig's niece, who was the most famous of the family saints. Since Elizabeth died at an earlier age than Hedwig and had only one daughter as opposed to the seven children Hedwig birthed, Ludwig I wanted to legitimize himself through Hedwig and prove his direct Piast lineage. Since its arrival to the J. Paul Getty Museum, art historians, like Jaroslav Folda and Jeffrey Hamburger, have noted that this manuscript is an exemplar of Bohemian book illumination and a testament to woman's religious devotion in the Middle Ages. Jeffrey Hamburger gives an interpretation of the manuscript as evidence of the developing status of art within monastic context.  Illuminations  In fol. 10v of the manuscript, Saint Hedwig is depicted with her family. This folio is anachronistic since the people depicted were already deceased, including Saint Hedwig's parents, making the illustration an impossibility. Ms. Ludwig XI 7 (83.MN.126), fol. 10v The iconography makes the image of Hedwig of Silesia look like a cult image. In fol. 12v, Saint Hedwig appears wearing a grey cloak while clutching the ivory statue of Virgin and child and a pair of shoes on her hands which she carried in case she met someone who was of importance to wear shoes for. A part of Hedwig's legend includes her leaving trails of blood coming from her feet due to her walking barefoot as an imitation of Christ and his apostles and the cold Polish winter. In fol. 12v., Duke Ludwig I of Liegnitz and his wife Agnes are miniature compared to Hedwig's full-page frontispiece. The ivory statue of Virgin and child that Saint Hedwig is holding in fol. 12v represents her cradling Duke Henry, her deceased son who died fighting the Tartar invaders. Unlike the Virgin Mary, Hedwig is shown without a crown, and instead, is given a red and white halo. Saint Hedwig not having a crown symbolizes her humility.  Sources/Resources/Further  * Alvis, R.

The A65 lacks the A77's magnesium alloy construction in favor of a polycarbonate resin (plastic) resulting in a lighter frame and slightly smaller dimensions and lacking weather-proofing capability. The A65 uses the USB 2.0 transfer interface of 480 Mbit/s, has HDMI type C for connectivity and remote capabilities using the RM-S1 accessory. The camera enters the market with its own tier entry into the range, boasting features such as a 24.3Mpx APS-C HD CMOS sensor using a single-lens translucent mirror and features full HD 1080p recording capabilities using H.264 compression. It hosts a variable burst-shooting mode up to 10fps, stereo audio recording capabilities and like others in the Sony Alpha range it has high sensitivity with ISO 100 to 16000, several noise reduction features, 8 white balance presets including custom balance and exposure control systems. The battery capacity is rated for 510 shots using the electronic viewfinder or 560 shots using the LCD. The capture format for images in raw format uses the .ARW extension, Sony's extension for raw. The rear panel has the same layout as the Sony Alpha 55 and whilst the LCD hosts a 4:3 aspect ratio compared to the A55's 16:9 it has the same resolution and adjustability.

Overview The UN Partition Plan. Before Israel gained independence in 1948, neither Israel nor the Arab nations surrounding it had many tanks. The Arabs and the Israelis had to find their weapons through arms dealers, or from any country that would supply them. A Palmach patrol in the Negev Palmach M4 Sherman tank leading a convoy. The first armored tanks and vehicles in Israel were, like many other countries, imported or based on other's designs; but eventually evolved into their own tank designs. But in Israel the plans to import them began before the country even was formed and rudimentory built armoured cars and trucks were prepared in secret. The Palmach was an elite fighting force of the Haganah, the underground army of the Yishuv (Jewish community) and had been established on 15 May 1941 and organized so by the outbreak of the Israeli War for Independence in 1948 it consisted of over 2,000 men and women in three fighting brigades. Following the United Nations General Assembly vote for the Partition Plan for Palestine on 29 November 1947, the Jewish forces plans went into action to build and procure mobile armoured cars and supply trucks and to purchase and bring in tanks and a large number of half-tracks to prepare for the termination of the British Mandate and Israeli proclamation of statehood on 14 May 1948.Resolution 181 (II). Future government of Palestine A/RES/181(II)(A+B) 29 November 1947 During this period the Jewish and Arab communities of British Mandate clashed with only light arms, while the British organized their withdrawal and intervened only on an occasional basis. From January onwards, operations became increasingly militarized. A number of Arab Liberation Army regiments infiltrated into Palestine, each active in a variety of distinct sectors around the different coastal towns. They consolidated their presence in Galilee and Samaria.Yoav Gelber (2006), pp.51‚Äì56 The Army of the Holy War, under the command of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, came from Egypt with several hundred men. Having recruited a few thousand volunteers, al-Husayni organised the blockade of the 100,000 Jewish residents of Jerusalem.Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971), chap.7, pp.131‚Äì153 To counter this, the Yishuv authorities tried to supply the city with convoys of up to 100 armoured vehicles, but the operation became more and more impractical as the number of casualties in the relief convoys surged. By March, al-Husayni's tactic had paid off. Almost all of Haganah's armoured vehicles had been destroyed, the blockade was in full operation, and hundreds of Haganah members who had tried to bring supplies into the city were killed.Benny Morris (2003), p. 163 The situation for those who dwelt in the Jewish settlements in the highly isolated Negev and North of Galilee was more critical. The Arab League began to believe that the Palestinian Arabs, reinforced by the Arab Liberation Army, could put an end to partition. The British decided on 7 February 1948 to support the annexation of the Arab part of Palestine by Jordan.Henry Laurens (2005), p.83 Otter armored car captured by the Haganah from the ALA (Arab Liberation Army- Kaukji's army) in 1948. Ben-Gurion ordered Yigal Yadin to plan in preparation for the announced intervention of the Arab states. The result of his analysis was Plan Dalet, which was put in place from the start of April onwards. The adoption of Plan Dalet marked the second stage of the war, in which Haganah took the offensive and the stated purpose of which was to take control of the territory of the Jewish state and to defend its borders and people, including the Jewish population outside of the borders, in expectation of an invasion by regular Arab armies. According to the Israeli Yehoshafat Harkabi, \\"Plan Dalet\\" called for the conquest of Arab towns and villages inside and along the borders of the area allocated to the proposed Jewish State‚Äîaccording to the UN Partition Plan. In case of resistance, the population of conquered villages was to be expelled outside the borders of the Jewish state. If no resistance was met, the residents could stay put, under military rule.MidEast Web, Plan Daleth (Plan D)Ten years of research into the 1947-49 war - The expulsion of the Palestinians re-examined. By Dominique Vidal. Le Monde diplomatique. December 1997.Palmach Hotchkiss H-39 tanks The first operation, named Nachshon, was directed at lifting the blockade on Jerusalem. Armored cars and forces tried to clear out the roads and escort supply trucks as they tried to reach Jerusalem. The Arab attacks on communications and roads has intensified. The failure of the convoys and the loss of Jewish armoured vehicles has shaken the Yishuv leaders confidence. 1,500 men from Haganah's Givati brigade and Palmach's Harel brigade conducted sorties to free up the route to the city between 5 April and 20 April. The operation was successful, and enough foodstuffs to last 2 months were trucked into Jerusalem for distribution to the Jewish population.Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971), pp.369‚Äì381 The success of the operation was assisted by the death of al-Husayni in combat. At the same time, the large-scale operation of the Arab Liberation Army was defeated at Mishmar HaEmek.Benny Morris (2003), pp. 242‚Äì243 Their Druze allies left them through defection.Benny Morris (2003), p.242 Within the framework of creating Jewish territorial continuity according to Plan Dalet, the forces of Haganah, Palmach and Irgun moved to consolidate areas with Jewish populations as the British had essentially withdrawn their troops. The situation pushed the leaders of the neighboring Arab states to intervene, with the Arab Legion of Transjordan's monarch, King Abdullah I moving tanks and armoured forces into the territory of the British Mandate of Palestine. Preparing for Arab intervention from neighbouring states, Haganah successfully launched Operations YiftahBenny Morris (2003), pp.248‚Äì252 and Ben-'AmiBenny Morris (2003), pp.252‚Äì254 and with limited armored forces they tried to hold what areas they had under their control and sent forces to secure the Jewish settlements of Galilee, and Operation Kilshon and created an Israeli-controlled front around Jerusalem. With the creation of Israel's army, the three Palmach Brigades were disbanded and its members formed the backbone of the Israel Defense Forces high command for many years. The few tanks and armoured cars of these Brigades were the beginning of what was to become a long history of armoured forces in the Israeli Army. History=Pre-World War I to British Mandate period= Jewish Brigade headquarters under the Union Flag and Jewish flag. The military forces of Israel can trace its roots to Jewish paramilitary organizations in the New Yishuv, starting with the Second Aliyah (1904 to 1914) and the Zion Mule Corps and the Jewish Legion of War World I, both of which were part of the British Army. After the 1920 Palestine riots against Jews in April 1920, the Yishuv's leadership saw the need to create a nationwide underground defense organization, and the Haganah was founded and became a full-scale defense force after the 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt in Palestine with an organized structure, consisting of three main units‚Äîthe Field Corps, Guard Corps, and later the Palmach. In 1942, there was a period of great concern for the Yishuv, when the forces of German General Erwin Rommel advanced east in North Africa towards the Suez Canal and there was fear that they would conquer Palestine. This event was the direct cause for the founding, with British support, of the PalmachHow the Palmach was formed (History Central)‚Äîa highly trained regular unit belonging to Haganah (a paramilitary group that was mostly made up of reserve troops). During World War II the successor to the Jewish Legion of World War I was the Jewish Brigade. Later, veterans of the Jewish Brigade became key participants of the new State of Israel's Israel Defense Forces. =End of British Mandate/Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War of 1948= Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War of 1948, October battles IDF soldiers of the Samson's Foxes unit advance in a captured Egyptian Bren Gun carrier. The modern military forces, the IDF was founded following the establishment of the State of Israel, after Defense Minister and Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion issued an order on 26 May 1948. In 1946, Ben-Gurion had decided that the Yishuv would probably have to defend itself against both the Palestinian Arabs and neighbouring Arab states and accordingly began a \\"massive, covert arms acquisition campaign in the West\\". By September 1947 the Haganah had \\"10,489 rifles, 702 light machine-guns, 2,666 submachine guns, 186 medium machine- guns, 672 two-inch mortars and 92 three-inch (76 mm) mortars\\" and acquired many more during the first few months of hostilities. Initially, the Haganah had no heavy machine guns, artillery, armored vehicles, anti-tank or anti- aircraft weapons, nor military aircraft or tanks.Morris, 2003, p. 16. In the United States, Yishuv agents purchased three B-17 bombers, and dozens of half- tracks, which were repainted and defined as \\"agricultural equipment\\". In Western Europe, Haganah agents amassed guns and mortars but most importantly ten H-35 light tanks, and a large number of half-tracks. The Israelis also got two Cromwell tanks from sympathizers at a arms depot in the Haifa port area, which would form the basis of the Israeli Armored Corps. A Cromwell tank Then on 14 May 1948, David Ben-Gurion declared the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz-Israel to be known as the State of Israel, a few hours before the termination of the Mandate at midnight and conflict with Arab irregulars as well as forces of the neighboring Arab states, Egypt, Jordan (Transjordan) and Syria, invaded what had just ceased to be the territory of the British Mandate,Yoav Gelber, Palestine 1948, 2006 ‚Äì Chap.8 \\"The Arab Regular Armies' Invasion of Palestine\\". and immediately attacked Jewish settlements.Morris,2008, pp. 236‚Äì237, 247, 253‚Äì254 A Hotchkiss H35 tank.

Egypt used Shermans, Crusaders and Matildas, as well as Light Tank Mark VI and M22 Locust light tanks. They may have used some Valentines, as well. The Syrians had Renault R35s and R39s (an improved R35). The Lebanese used Renault FTs.

The new army of Israel organized itself quickly during the ensuing 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War as the neighbouring Arab states attacked Israel. Twelve infantry and armored brigades formed: Golani, Carmeli, Alexandroni, Kiryati, Givati, Etzioni, the 7th, and 8th armored brigades, Oded, Harel, Yiftach, and Negev. Some of the armoured brigades formed during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War had Sherman tanks and mounted infantry and some also contained an artillery element. One of the brigades, the 7th Armored Brigade (, Hativa Sheva) was the main force in the Battles of Latrun. Israeli Tank M4A4 Sherman V, in Yad la-Shiryon Museum, Israel. Facing them was the forces of the Egypt's army which in 1948, was able to put a maximum of around 40,000 men into the field. Initially, an expeditionary force of 10,000 men was sent to Palestine, consisting of five infantry battalions, one armoured battalion equipped with British Light Tank Mk VI and Matilda tanks, one battalion of sixteen 25-pounder guns, a battalion of eight 6-pounder guns and one medium-machine-gun battalion with supporting troops. The other main force facing Israel was Jordan's Arab Legion, which was considered the most effective Arab force. Armed, trained and commanded by British officers, this 8,000‚Äì12,000 strong force was organised in four infantry/mechanised regiments supported by some 40 artillery pieces and 75 armoured cars. Until January 1948, it was reinforced by the 3,000-strong Transjordan Frontier Force. As many as 48 British officers served in the Arab Legion. Glubb Pasha, was the commander of the Legion. The Arab Legion joined the war in May 1948, but fought only in the areas that King Abdullah wanted to secure for Jordan: the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. R-35 light tank destroyed at Degania Alef. On 14 May Syria invaded Israel with the 1st Infantry Brigade supported by a battalion of armoured cars, a company of French R35 and R39 tanks, an artillery battalion and other units. However within a week it had been halted in a series of battles around Degania.Pollack 2002, pp. 448-457 The heaviest fighting occurred in Jerusalem and on the Jerusalem ‚Äì Tel Aviv road, between Jordan's Arab Legion and Israeli forces. After the 1948 war, the Israel Defense Forces shifted to low intensity conflict against Arab Palestinian guerrillas. In late 1954, Nasser began a policy of sponsoring raids into Israel by the fedayeen, triggering a series of Israeli reprisal operations.Vatikiotis, P.J. Nasser and his Generation, pp. 252‚Äì253. At this time following the outbreak of the Algerian War in late 1954, France began to ship more and more arms to Israel.Neff, Donald Warriors at Suez, pp. 160‚Äì161. In November 1954, Shimon Peres visited Paris, where he was received by the French Defense Minister Marie-Pierre K≈ìnig, who told him that France would sell Israel any weapons it wanted to buy.Neff, Donald Warriors at Suez, pp. 162‚Äì163. By early 1955, France was shipping large amounts of weapons to Israel. Then Nasser's moved towards the nationalization of the Suez Canal and sent Egyptian forces to seize control of the canal and implement its nationalization.Kissinger, p. 530 Egypt also closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, and blockaded the Gulf of Aqaba, in contravention of the Constantinople Convention of 1888. As tensions mounted, Israel also made an application to the US in 1955 to purchase 60 M47 tanks. After the US refused, Israel applied again in 1958, this time to purchase 100 M47 tanks, but the answer was the same. =1956 Suez Crisis= Israeli AMX-13. Damaged tank and vehicles, Sinai War, 1956. At the period right before the 1956 Suez war, the Israelis were also deeply troubled by Egypt‚Äôs procurement of large amounts of Soviet weaponry that included 530 armored vehicles, of which 230 were tanks and the influx of this advanced weaponry altered an already shaky balance of power.Zeev Schiff, A History of the Israeli Army, pp. 65‚Äì66, Simon and Schuster (1974) Additionally, Israel believed Egypt had formed a secret alliance with Jordan and Syria.Soviets Threaten Israel, Ben-Gurion Responds. Jewishvirtuallibrary.org. Retrieved on 8 September 2011. So with British and French support, Israel reacted and sent its armoured forces into the Sinai and Gaza Strip in the 1956 Suez Crisis, the IDF's first test of strength after 1949, the new army proved itself by capturing the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt. The main IDF tank at the time was the AMX-13 along with some US made World War II armor and faced the Egyptian military well equipped with weapons from the Soviet Union such as T-34 and JS-3 tanks, and self-propelled guns. In the Gaza strip city of Rafah was strategically important to Israel because control of that city would sever the Gaza Strip from the Sinai and provide a way to the main centres of the northern Sinai, al-Arish and al-Qantarah.Varble, Derek (2003) p. 40. Holding the forts outside of Rafah were a mixture of Egyptian and Palestinian forces in the 5th Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier General Jaafar al-Abd. In Rafah itself the 87th Palestinian Infantry Brigade was stationed. Assigned to capture Rafah were 1st Infantry Brigade led by Colonel Benjamin Givli and 27th Armored Brigade commanded by Colonel Haim Bar- Lev of the IDF. To the south of Rafah were a series of mine-filled sand dunes and to the north were a series of fortified hills. Israeli AMX-13 on display at \\"Yad La-Shiryon\\" armor museum. Egyptian Army T-34-85 tank Egyptian M4A4 with FL-10 Turret. Former Egyptian Army IS-3M Dayan ordered the IDF forces to seize Crossroads 12 in the central Rafah area, and to focus on breaking through rather than reducing every Egyptian strongpoint. The IDF assault began with Israeli sappers and engineers clearing a path at night through the minefields that surrounded Rafah. French warships led by the cruiser Georges Leygues provided fire support, through Dayan had a low opinion of the French gunnery, complaining that the French only struck the Egyptian reserves.Varble, Derek (2003) p. 41. Using the two paths cleared through the southern minefields, IDF tanks entered the Rafah salient. Under Egyptian artillery fire, the IDF force raced ahead and took Crossroads 12 with the loss of 2 killed and 22 wounded. In the north, the Israeli troops fought a confused series of night actions, but were successful in storming Hills 25, 25A, 27 and 29 with the loss of six killed. In the morning of 1 November, Israeli AMX-13s encircled and took Hills 34 and 36.Varble, Derek (2003) pp. 41‚Äì43. At that point, General al-Abd ordered his forces to abandon their posts outside of Rafah and retreat into the city.Varble, Derek (2003) p. 43. With Rafah more or less cut off and Israeli forces controlling the northern and eastern roads leading into the city, Dayan ordered the AMX-13s of the 27th Armored Brigade to strike west and take al-Arish. By this point, Nasser had ordered his forces to fall back towards the Suez Canal, so at first the Bar-Lev and his men met little resistance as they advanced across the northern Sinai. On 29 October, Operation Kadesh ‚Äì the invasion of the Sinai, began when an Israeli paratrooper battalion was air-dropped into the Sinai Peninsula, east of the Suez Canal near the Mitla Pass. At the same time, Colonel Sharon's 202nd Paratroop Brigade raced out towards the Mitla Pass. Dayan‚Äôs efforts to maintain strategic surprise bore fruit when the Egyptian commander Field Marshal Abdel Hakim Amer at first treated the reports of an Israeli inclusion into the Sinai as a large raid instead of an invasion, and as such Amer did not order a general alert. By the time that Amer realized his mistake, the Israelis had made significant advances into the Sinai. Dayan had no more plans for further advances beyond the passes, but Sharon decided to attack the Egyptian positions at Jebel Heitan. Sharon sent his lightly armed paratroopers against dug-in Egyptians supported by aircraft, tanks and heavy artillery. Sharon's actions were in response to reports of the arrival of the 1st and 2nd Brigades of the 4th Egyptian Armored Division in the area, which Sharon believed would annihilate his forces if he did not seize the high ground. Sharon sent two infantry companies, a mortar battery and some AMX-13 tanks under the command of Mordechai Gur into the Heitan Defile on the afternoon of 31 October 1956. The Egyptian forces occupied strong defensive positions and brought down heavy anti-tank, mortar and machine gun fire on the IDF force. Gur's men were forced to retreat into the \\"Saucer\\", where they were surrounded and came under heavy fire. Sharon sent in another task force while Gur's men used the cover of night to scale the walls of the Heitan Defile. During the ensuing action, the Egyptians were defeated and forced to retreat. On 30 October, a probing attack by Israeli armour under Major Izhak Ben-Ari turned into an assault on the Umm Qataf ridge that ended in failure. To the south, another unit of the Israeli 7th Armored Brigade discovered the al-Dayyiqa gap in the Jebel Halal ridge of the \\"Hedgehog\\". The Israeli forces stormed and took the al-Dayyiqa gap. An IDF force entered the al-Dayyiqa and at dawn on 31 October attacked Abu Uwayulah and after an hour's fighting, Abu Uwayulah fell to the IDF. On the morning of 1 November, Israeli and French aircraft launched attacks on the Egyptian troops at Umm Qataf and the 37th Armored Brigade came in and joined the 10th Brigade to assault Umm Qataf, and the Egyptian commander ordered a general retreat from the \\"Hedgehog\\" on the evening of 1 November. =1967 Six-Day War= Centurions shortly before the Six-Day War. Sherman M-51. In the 1967 Six-Day War, with the exception of Jordan, the Arabs relied principally on Soviet tanks and weaponry. Egypt, Syria and Iraq used T-34/85, T-54, T-55, PT-76, and SU-100/152 World War II-vintage self-propelled guns. Jordan's army was equipped with American weaponry, and used M-47, M-48, and M-48A1 Patton tanks. Israeli weapons were mainly of Western origin and its armoured units were mostly of British and American design and manufacture. In the early 1960s, Israel signed a deal with West Germany to purchase 150 M48A2 Patton tanks. However, due to strong Arab nation opposition, only 40 were received. Then the US decided to supply the remaining 110 M48A2 Patton tanks and to add another 100 M48 tanks. So, in 1965, Israel received 90 M48 tanks from the US and another 120 M48 tanks in 1966. At this time, Israel had 250 M48 Patton tanks, 150 of them M48A1 and 100 of them M48A2, all of these armed with a 90mm main gun. Israel upgraded those tanks to M48A3's by replacing their engines and transmissions with newer models. These tanks were also fitted with a new 105mm L7 gun (same as on the Centurion MBT) and with the Israeli Urdan cupola. 293 Centurion tanks were operational at the beginning of the war. Israeli M50 Super Sherman. So, by the time of the Six-Day War, Israel had in use the M50 and M51 Shermans, M48A3 Patton, Centurion, AMX-13. The Sherman M-50 and the Sherman M-51, were known abroad as the Super Sherman, and were modified versions of the American M4 Sherman tank. The Sherman also underwent extensive modifications, including a larger 105mm medium velocity French gun, a redesigned turret, wider tracks, more armour, and an upgraded engine and suspension. The Centurion was upgraded with the British 105 mm L7 gun prior to the war. During the Six-day War, only 120 of Israel's 250 M48 tanks were combat ready; they were mainly engaged on the Sinai front against the Egyptian army. M48s were also used with mixed results during the 1967 Six- Day War. On the Sinai front, Israeli M48s up-gunned with 105 mm L7 rifled guns were used with success against Egyptian IS-3s, T-54s, T-34s and SU-100s supplied by the Soviet Union in the second battle of Abu-Ageila. However, on the West Bank front, Jordanian M48s were often defeated by Israeli 105mm Centurions and WWII-era M4 Shermans (M-51s up-gunned with 105 mm guns). In pure technical terms, the Patton was superior to the Sherman, with shots at more than 1,000 meters simply glancing off the M48s' armor. However, the 105 mm gun of the Israeli Shermans fired a HEAT round designed to defeat the T-62 tank, which was the Soviet response to the M48's successor in US service, the M60. The Jordanian Pattons' failure on the West Bank could also be attributed to Israeli air superiority. The Israeli Army captured about 100 Jordanian M48 and M48A1 tanks and pressed them into service in their own units after the war. The Egyptian forces consisted of seven divisions: four armoured, two infantry, and one mechanized infantry. Overall, Egypt had around 100,000 troops and 900‚Äì950 tanks in the Sinai, backed by 1,100 APCs and 1,000 artillery pieces.Pollack 2004, p. 59. This arrangement was thought to be based on the Soviet doctrine, where mobile armour units at strategic depth provide a dynamic defense while infantry units engage in defensive battles. Former Egyptian Army IS-3M Captured Egyptian Army SU-100, Batey Ha-Osef Museum, Israel. Former Egyptian PT-76 in Yad la-Shiryon Museum, Israel. Israeli forces concentrated on the border with Egypt included six armoured brigades, one infantry brigade, one mechanized infantry brigade, three paratrooper brigades, giving a total of around 70,000 men and 700 tanks, who were organized in three armoured divisions. The Israelis broke through with tank-led assaults against the Egyptian army in Sinai. In the Battle of Abu-Ageila, the Israeli 38th Armored Division under Major-General Ariel Sharon assaulted Um-Katef a heavily fortified area defended by the Egyptian 2nd Infantry Division where the Egyptians also had a battalion of tank destroyers and a tank regiment, formed of Soviet World War II armour, which included 90 T-34-85 tanks, 22 SU-100 tank destroyers, and about 16,000 men. The Israelis had about 14,000 men and 150 post-World War II tanks including the AMX-13, Centurions, and M50 Super Shermans (modified M-4 Sherman tanks). Israeli tanks managed to penetrate the northern flank of Abu Ageila, and by dusk, all units were in position. The Israelis then brought up 90 105mm and 155mm artillery guns for a preparatory barrage, and Israeli tanks assaulted the northernmost Egyptian defenses and were largely successful, though an entire armoured brigade was stalled by mines, and had only one mine-clearance tank. The battle ended in an Israeli victory, with 40 Egyptian and 19 Israeli tanks destroyed. In the center of Israel, the Jordanian Armed Forces, which included 11 brigades totalling some 55,000 troops and equipped with some 300 modern Western tanks, were brought to bear. Nine of these brigades (45,000 troops, 270 tanks, 200 artillery pieces) were deployed in the West Bank, including the elite 40th armoured; the other two were in the Jordan Valley. The Jordanian Army, then known as the Arab Legion, moved against the Israeli forces. Against Jordan's forces on the West Bank, Israel deployed about 40,000 troops and 200 tanks (8 brigades).Pollack 2004, p. 294 Israeli Central Command forces consisted of five brigades. The first two were permanently stationed near Jerusalem and were called the Jerusalem Brigade and the mechanized Harel Brigade. Mordechai Gur's 55th paratrooper brigade was summoned from the Sinai front. The 10th Armored Brigade was stationed north of the West Bank. The Israeli Northern Command provided a division (3 brigades) led by Major-General Elad Peled, which was stationed to the north of the West Bank, in the Jezreel Valley. The Israelis launched an offensive to push back the Jordanian forces and encircle Jerusalem, supported by intense tank, artillery and mortar fire to soften up Jordanian positions and captured their objectives after heavy fighting. The Jordanian M48 Pattons, with their external fuel tanks, proved vulnerable at short distances, even to the Israeli-modified Shermans. During the war, Israel captured about 100 of Jordan's 170 M48/M48A1 tanks. Israel decided not to take the M47 tanks left by the Jordanian army, as they were already obsolete at that time. In the north on the Golan Heights, the Israeli forces faced the Syrian army which consisted of about 75,000 men grouped in nine brigades, supported by an adequate amount of artillery and armour. Israeli forces used in combat consisted of two brigades (the 8th Armored Brigade and the Golani Brigade) in the northern part of the front at Givat HaEm, and another two in the center. The 8th Armored Brigade, led by Colonel Albert Mandler, advanced into the Golan Heights from Givat HaEm. Its advance was spearheaded by Engineering Corps sappers and eight bulldozers, which cleared away barbed wire and mines. As they advanced, the force came under fire, and five bulldozers were immediately hit. The Israeli tanks, with their maneuverability sharply reduced by the terrain, advanced slowly under fire toward the fortified village of Sir al-Dib, with their ultimate objective being the fortress at Qala. Israeli casualties steadily mounted. Part of the attacking force lost its way and emerged opposite of Za'ura, a redoubt manned by Syrian reservists. With the situation critical, Colonel Mandler ordered simultaneous assaults on Za'ura and Qala. Heavy and confused fighting followed, with Israeli and Syrian tanks struggling around obstacles and firing at extremely short ranges. The first three Israeli tanks to enter Qala were stopped by a Syrian bazooka team, and a relief column of seven Syrian tanks arrived to repel the attackers. The Israelis took heavy fire from the houses, but could not turn back, as other forces were advancing behind them, and they were on a narrow path with mines on either side. The Israelis continued pressing forward, and called for air support. A pair of Israeli jets destroyed two of the Syrian tanks, and the remainder withdrew. The surviving defenders of Qala retreated after their commander was killed. Meanwhile, Za'ura fell in an Israeli assault, and the Israelis also captured the 'Ein Fit fortress.Oren, pp. 281‚Äì282 Israel conquered the Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip, West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and Golan Heights from the surrounding Arab states, changing the balance of power in the region as well as the role of the IDF. =War of Attrition= King Hussein after checking an abandoned Israeli tank after Israeli raid at Karameh The War of Attrition was fighting from 1967 to 1970 between Israel and Egypt, Jordan, PLO and their allies following the 1967 Six- Day War with support from the armored forces such as in the Israeli raid at Karameh, but no major tank battles. Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser pushed for a military initiative to compel Israel or the international community to facilitate a full Israeli withdrawal from Sinai.Dunstan 2003, pp. 7‚Äì14 Usually it was limited artillery duels and small-scale incursions into Sinai, but by 1969 the Egyptian Army started larger-scale operations. On March 8, 1969, Nasser proclaimed the official launch of the War of Attrition, characterized by large-scale shelling along the Suez Canal, extensive aerial warfare and commando raids. Hostilities continued until August 1970 shortly before Nasser's death and ended with a ceasefire, the frontiers remaining the same as when the war began, with no real commitment to serious peace negotiations. =Yom Kippur War= The 1973 War in the Sinai, October 15‚Äì24. Egyptian president Anwar Sadat had signaled soon after he Nasser's death that, in return for a total withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula, he was ready to recognize Israel as an independent state but this did not lead to any agreement with Israel, so Sadat felt he had only the military option. The Yom Kippur war was a conflict between the Arab world and Israel that lasted from October 6, 1973 to October 25, 1973. The Yom Kippur War began when a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria attacked Israel on Yom Kippur which happens to be the Jewish day of atonement and the holiest day for people of the Judaic faith. The Arab coalition launched a joint surprise attack on Israeli positions in the Israeli-occupied territories on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism, which occurred that year during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Egyptian and Syrian forces crossed ceasefire lines to enter the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights Anticipating a swift Israeli armored counterattack by three armored divisions,Shazly, pp. 224‚Äì225. the Egyptians had armed their assault force with large numbers of man-portable anti-tank weapons‚Äîrocket-propelled grenades and the less numerous but more advanced Sagger guided missiles, which proved devastating to the first Israeli armored counterattacks. Each of the five infantry divisions that was to cross the canal had been equipped with RPG-7 rockets and RPG-43 grenades, and reinforced with an anti-tank guided missile battalion. A map of the fighting on the Golan Heights. The Israelis who have begun to receive quantities of the US M60 Patton tanks and use in their armoured forces, counterattacked the Egyptians with the 162nd Armored Division composed of three brigades totaling 183 tanks and the Israeli 143rd Armoured Division, which was led by General Ariel Sharon, who had been reinstated as a division commander at the outset of the war and Egyptian armored attacks were repulsed with heavy losses.Gawrych 1996, pp. 41‚Äì42. Then the Israeli forces detected a gap between the Egyptian Second and Third armies and as these armies attacked eastward in six simultaneous thrusts over a broad front, they left behind five infantry divisions to hold the bridgeheads over the Suez canal crossings. The attacking Egyptian forces consisted of 800Schiff, A History of the Israeli Army, p. 310.-1,000 tanksCite error: The named reference abc-clio1 was invoked but never defined with artillery support. They were up against 700-750 Israeli tanks. The Egyptian armored thrust suffered heavy losses as Egyptian units launched head-on- attacks against the waiting Israeli defenses.Rabinovich, p. 355. The Israelis repulsed the armoured thrust and followed up with counterattack through the gap between the Egyptian 2nd and 3rd Armies and established bridgeheads on the east and west banks of the canal. The Israeli Armored Divisions then crossed through the breach to the west bank of the canal and swung southward, encircling the 3rd Army.Pollack, p. 118. The Israeli forces on the west bank launched an offensive with an armoured thrust toward Ismailia and toward Suez City while other Israeli forces pushed west toward Cairo and south toward Adabiya. By the end of the war, the Israelis had advanced to positions some 101 kilometres from Egypt's capital, Cairo, and occupied 1,600 square kilometres west of the Suez Canal. They had also cut the Cairo-Suez road and encircled the bulk of Egypt's Third Army. An Israeli M60 Patton tank destroyed in the Sinai. Israeli tanks crossing the Suez Canal An abandoned Syrian T-55 tank on the Golan Heights Abandoned Syrian T-62 tanks on the Golan Heights. One of the greatest tank battles in history, the Battle of Golan Heights, took place during the Yom Kippur War. In the Golan Heights, the Syrians attacked two Israeli brigades and eleven artillery batteries with five divisions (the 7th, 9th and 5th, with the 1st and 3rd in reserve) and 188 batteries. They began their attack with an airstrike by about 100 aircraft and a 50-minute artillery barrage. The forward brigades of three divisions then penetrated the cease-fire lines and bypassed United Nations observer posts, followed by the main assault force, which was covered by mobile anti-aircraft batteries, bulldozers to penetrate anti-tank ditches, bridge-layers to overcome obstacles, and mine-clearance vehicles. The engineering vehicles were priority targets for Israeli gunners and took heavy losses, but Syrian infantrymen, braving intense fire, advanced forward and used their entrenching tools to build up earthen causeways for the tanks, enabling them to overcome anti-tank ditches. At the onset of the battle, the Israeli brigades of some 3,000 troops, 180 tanks and 60 artillery pieces faced off against three infantry divisions with large armour components comprising 28,000 Syrian troops, 800 tanks and 600 artillery pieces. In addition, the Syrians deployed two armoured divisions from the second day onwards.Peter Caddick-Adams, \\"Golan Heights, battles of\\", The Oxford Companion to Military History, ed. Richard Holmes. Oxford University Press, 2001.O'Ballance (1978). Chapter 7 : \\"The Syrians attack\\", pp. 119‚Äì146. Every Israeli tank deployed on the Golan Heights was engaged during the initial attacks. Reservists were directed to the Golan as quickly as possible. They were assigned to tanks and sent to the front as soon as they arrived at army depots, without waiting for the crews they trained with to arrive, machine guns to be installed on the tanks, or taking the time to calibrate the tank guns (a time-consuming process known as bore-sighting). The Syrians had expected it to take at least 24 hours for Israeli reserves to reach the front lines; in fact, reserve units began reaching the battle lines only 15 hours after the war began. Israeli reserve forces approaching the Golan Heights were subjected to Syrian artillery fire directed from Mount Hermon. Syrian forces suffered heavy losses as Israeli tanks and infantry fought desperately to buy time for reserve forces to reach the front lines, and conducted stopgap blocking actions whenever the Syrians were on the verge of breaking through. However, the Syrians pressed the attack in spite of their losses, and the vastly outnumbered defenders lost a number of tanks. Whenever Syrian tanks penetrated the Israeli lines, Israeli gunners would immediately rotate their turrets and destroy them before turning their attention back to the oncoming forces. At night, the Syrians made deadly use of infrared technology, while the Israelis responded by using illumination rounds and xenon light projectors on their tanks. The tide in the Golan began to turn as the arriving Israeli reserve forces were able to contain the Syrian advance. Beginning on October 8, the Israelis began pushing the Syrians back towards the pre-war ceasefire lines, inflicting heavy tank losses. By October 10, the last Syrian unit in the central sector had been pushed back across the Purple Line (the pre-war ceasefire line). After four days of intense and incessant combat, the Israelis had succeeded in ejecting the Syrians from the entire Golan. The UN brought about a ceasefire, largely negotiated between the U.S. and Soviet Union, on October 22, but though most heavy fighting ended on October 28, the fighting never stopped until January 18, 1974. Israeli Magach 6B tank in the Yad La-Shiryon Armored Corps Memorial and Museum, Latrun. The IDF had also a number of Magach (◊û◊í◊ó; Ma-GAKH) tanks in Israeli service which were based on the American M48 and M60 Patton tanks. The Magach 1, 2, 3 and 5 were based upon M48 tanks; the later Magach 6 and 7 were based upon M60 tanks. These tanks had modifications included replacement of the original 90 mm gun with the British 105 mm L7, lowering the command turret's profile, upgraded communication suite, and replacement of the flammable and weak gasoline engine with a 750 hp diesel one.When the Yom Kippur War broke out, Israel had a total of 540 of the modified M48A3 (with 105mm gun) and M60A1 tanks... But during the war, the tanks suffered heavy losses. The location of flammable hydraulic fluid at the front of the turret was discovered to be a severe vulnerability. A large number of these Israeli tanks were destroyed or terminally hit during the war, mostly in the Sinai front against entrenched Egyptian infantry armed with AT-3 Sagger anti tank missiles. After the war, the losses were replaced with new M48A5 (Magach 5) and M60 (Magach 6) which were fitted with better armor in response to the anti tank missile losses. The surprise of the Yom Kippur War, and its aftermath completely changed the IDF's procedures and approach to warfare. Organizational changes were made and more time was dedicated to training for conventional warfare. The armoured forces also were involved in the Lebanese Civil War, Operation Litani and later the 1982 Lebanon War, where the IDF ousted Palestinian guerilla organizations from Lebanon. Development of Israel's tanks Sho't Kal, an upgraded Centurion tank. It was considered in many respects superior to the Soviet T-54/55.Insight Team of the London Sunday Times, pp. 291‚Äì293. In 1965, Israel's military establishment began research and development on a domestically produced tank, the \\"Sabra\\" (not to be confused with the later model of the same name which is now in service, see: Sabra tank). Initially, Britain and Israel collaborated to adapt the United Kingdom's Chieftain tank that had entered British Army service in 1966. However, in 1969, Britain decided not to sell the tank to Israel for political reasons. Israel Tal, who was serving as a brigade commander after the Suez Crisis, restarted plans to produce an Israeli-made tank, drawing on lessons from the 1973 Yom Kippur War, in which Israeli forces were outnumbered by those of the Middle East's Arab nations. By 1974 initial designs were completed and prototypes were built. After a brief set of trials, work began to retool the Tel HaShomer ordnance depot for full-time development and construction. After the new facilities were completed, the Merkava was announced to the public in the International Defense Review periodical. The first official images of the tank were then released to the American periodical Armed Forces Journal on May 14, 1977. The IDF officially adopted the tank in December 1978. The first Merkava Mk. 1 tanks were supplied to the IDF in April 1979, nearly nine years after the decision to produce the Merkava Mk. 1 tank was taken. The Merkava series of main battle tank represents the backbone of Israeli armor elements. In addition to its own designs, Iareal had upgraded the many tanks it had and even renamed them. Israel's formerly British Centurions, bought in the late 1960s, were renamed \\"Sho't\\" (\\"scourge\\" or \\"whip\\") by the Israelis and heavily upgraded following their purchase. When the Six-day War broke out in 1967, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had 293 Centurion tanks that were ready for combat out of a total of 385 tanks. During the war, Israel captured 30 of Jordan's 44 Centurion tanks. Original Centurions had 20 pounder main guns, but these were quickly up-gunned to the British 105 mm L7. The vehicles went through a number of modifications, both major and minor, culminating in the Sho't with blazer package seen in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon and retired with honour during the 1990s. The biggest modifications were the upgrades of the engine, sights and blazer packages. The engine has been changed to a more efficient diesel engine, fire control has been modernized, armour has been thickened, and an improved ammunition layout allows more rounds to be carried. An improved fire extinguishing system, better electrical system and brakes, and an increased fuel capacity, complete the modifications. The Sh'ot can be distinguished from the Centurion by its raised rear deck, to accommodate the bigger engine. They either have the original 7.62 mm calibre MG on the commander's cupola or have it replaced by a 12.7 mm calibre HMG and American radios. Many different variants were bought by Israel over the years from many different countries. Many components of these would find their way into the Merkava. Subvariants indicate upgrades received by Sho't Kal tanks during their operational life, including a new turret rotating mechanism, a new gun stabilizer, a new fire- control system and preparations for the installation of the Blazer Reactive armour. Israeli Sho't Kal Alef Though the Sho't tank was not commonly perceived as a principal battle tank during the Six-Day War (1967), nor the Yom Kippur war (1973); it was in fact considered the Israeli Army's most- effective tank. This Israeli version of the Centurion earned its legendary status during the Battle of \\"The Valley of Tears\\" on the Golan Heights in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Less than 100 Centurion tanks of the 7th Armoured Brigade defeated the advance of some 500 Syrian T-55s and T-62s. Fighting the Syrian army on the Golan Heights during the Yom Kippur War, two damaged Centurion/Sho‚Äôt tanks engaged approximately 150 Syrian T-55/T-62 tanks. In the course of the following 30-hour tank battle, the two tanks knocked out over 60 tanks.Military Channel - \\"Top 10 Tanks - Centurion (No.5)\\" The destruction of this entire armored division forced the Syrian army to halt their advance. The Sho't became emblematic of Israeli armour prowess. However, as all tanks in the opening days of the 1973 Yom Kippur war, it proved exceedingly vulnerable to Soviet-made weapons such as the RPG-2, RPG-7, and briefcase Sagger guided missile, weapons that the Egyptians used in large numbers in the crossing of the Bar Lev line. It is estimated that the Israeli armed forces lost up to 40% of their southern armored groups during the first two days of the war, highlighting the necessity for infantry support to armoured groups, culminating in the Merkava main battle tanks being equipped with rear troop bays. Foreign military imports of tank equipment or tanks=France= Decommissioned IDF AMX-13 tank Starting on the Independence day on 14 May 1948 (5 Iyar 5708), a strong military, commercial and political relationship were established between France and Israel until 1969. In 1953, an Israeli delegation visited France to examine the new AMX 13 light tank. The tank was armed with the high-velocity 75 mm gun CN 75-50, a development of the German 7.5 cm KwK 42 L/70 (used in the Panther tank). While the gun was satisfactory, the armor of the French tank was considered too light. Eventually, Israel did purchase the AMX 13; however in a parallel development, it was decided to graft the powerful French gun onto the available, familiar and better-armored hull of the American M4 Sherman, as the standard tank of the IDF armored units in the early 1950s.Givati, p. 82-85. The highest level of the military collaboration was reached between 1956 and 1966.The Bomb in the Basement. Michael Karpin, ed. Simon & Schuster. . At this time France provided almost all the tanks along with aircraft and military ships. In 1969 the French president Charles de Gaulle limited the export of weapons to Israel. This was the end of the \\"golden age\\" 20 years of relations between Israel and France. =United States= M60 tank unloaded from a USAF C-5 Galaxy during Operation Nickel Grass Operation Nickel Grass was an overt strategic airlift and operation conducted by the United States to deliver weapons and supplies to Israel during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. In a series of events that took place over 32 days, the Military Airlift Command of the U.S. Air Force shipped 22,325 tons of tanks, artillery, ammunition, and supplies in C-141 Starlifter and C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft between October 14 and November 14, 1973.AirForce Journal on Operation Nickel Grass The U.S. support helped ensure that Israel survived a coordinated and surprise life-threatening attack from the Soviet-backed Arab Republic of Egypt and Syrian Arab Republic. The U.S. military maintains two classified, pre-positioned War Reserve Stocks in Israel valued at $493 million. Israel has the official distinction of being an American Major non-NATO ally. As a result of this, the US and Israel share the vast majority of their security and military technology. Since 1976, Israel had been the largest annual recipient of U.S. foreign assistance. In 2009, Israel received $2.55 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) grants from the Department of Defense. All but 26% of this military aid is for the purchase of military hardware from American companies only. =Federal Republic of Germany= The Israeli Merkava MK IV tank uses a German V12 engine produced under license. =United Kingdom= An Israeli Centurion tank operating in the Sinai. After the British withdrew, they left behind some equipment, including Bren Gun Carriers ( a common name describing a family of light-armoured tracked vehicles built by Vickers-Armstrong), that was utilized by the Israelis. Bren Gun Carriers were usually used for transporting personnel and equipment, mostly support weapons, or as machine gun platforms and is the most-produced armoured fighting vehicle in history. During a secret operation in 1966, two British-manufactured Chieftain tanks were brought to Israel for a 4-year-long evaluation for service with the IDF. The plan was for the IDF not only to purchase some Chieftains, but for IMI (Israeli Military Industries) to produce the tank under license. As part of the deal during the early 1960s, Israel purchased second-hand Centurion tanks from the United Kingdom. After the trials were done, Israeli improvements and ideas were implemented by the British manufacturer, but British politicians cancelled the agreement with Israel and the program was shut down. The knowledge earned during the improvements on the 'Chieftain', together with earlier experiments in tank improvements, gave the last push for the development and production of the 'Merkava' tank. The British-made Centurion Main Battle Tank was a commercial, as well as a military, success. The Centurion was perhaps the first tank to face itself in a shooting war. Egypt, Iraq, and Israel bought Centurions and used them against one another in the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli wars. Some feel the reason that Israeli Centurions defeated the Arab T-55's and even T-62's is because the Centurion has good sights and the Arab tanks were downgrades of the original design, as the T-55 used by the Soviet and Warsaw pact Armies had 200mm armor thickness while T-55's sold to the Arabs had only 120mm frontal armor and mediocre side and rear armor.

Israel purchased the Centurion in the late 1950s and in IDF service it was named the Shot (Whip). Its excellent armour, mobility and firepower made it the preferred choice and many tanks were purchased well into the 1960s. All were upgraded with the Royal Ordnance L-7 105mm gun during the late 1960s and from 1970 were fitted with the US Continental diesel engine and transmission. The upgraded tanks were known as the Shot-Kal, and this upgrade was later used by other Centurion operators. The tanks saw action in the 1967 and 1973 Wars, after the battle for the Golan Heights in 1973, the Shot-Kal was dubbed \\"The Tank That Saved Israel\\". After the 1973 war the Shot-Kal was fitted with Blazer reactive armour which pre- detonated incoming missiles and grenades with HEAT warheads. The tanks saw action again in the 1982 incursion into Lebanon. Many tanks were later converted to other use including the Puma Armoured Engineer Vehicle, Nagmashot, Nagmachon and Nakpadon heavy APC's.

Israel needed tanks to defend her borders from the Arab states and the American M48 tank was the best choice at the time.

He has been called \\"the first cardiologist in the modern sense\\". He is known for discovering the early diastolic murmur of mitral stenosis in 1829. James Hope Life He was born at Stockport in Cheshire 23 February 1801, the son of Thomas Hope, merchant and manufacturer, he of Prestbury Hall near Macclesfield. After four years (1815‚Äì18) at Macclesfield grammar school, James resided for about 18 months at Oxford, where his elder brother was then an undergraduate, but never became a member of the university. In October 1820 Hope went as a medical student to Edinburgh University, where he studied for five years. The subject of his inaugural medical dissertation (August 1825) was aneurism of the aorta, and he then began a collection of drawings of pathological specimens coming under his notice. A president of the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh, he held the posts of house-physician and house-surgeon at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Leaving Edinburgh in December 1825, Hope became a medical student at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, and in the spring of 1826 obtained the diploma of the Royal College of Surgeons. That summer he left England for the continent, and stayed a year at Paris as one of the clinical clerks of Auguste Fran√ßois Chomel at the H√¥pital de la Charit√©. He then visited Switzerland, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands, and returned England in June 1828. In September he became a licentiate the Royal College of Physicians. Hope went into medical practice in December 1828 in Lower Seymour Street, Portman Square, London, and entered himself as a pupil at St. George's Hospital, where he was one of the early champions of auscultation. \\"He described a soft early diastolic murmur due to mitral stenosis and was the first to distinguish it from the diastolic murmur of aortic reflux. It was once called Hope's murmur.\\" In 1829 he established a private dispensary linked to the Portman Square and Harley Street district visiting societies. In 1831 he was elected physician to the Marylebone Infirmary, where he had charge of ninety beds. In the autumn of 1832 he delivered at his own home a course of lectures, intended for practitioners only, on diseases of the chest. He afterwards lectured at St. George's Hospital, where he was elected assistant physician in 1834, and at the Aldersgate Street School of Medicine. Hope's investigations into the causes of heart sounds involved vivisection. A series of his experiments led in February 1835 to controversy with Charles James Blasius Williams. In July 1839, on the resignation of William Frederick Chambers, he was appointed full physician at St. George's Hospital, after some opposition from Williams. He then suffered spitting of blood, and his health began to decline. In July 1840 he was elected a fellow of the College of Physicians. Towards the end of 1840 Hope had to give up most duties, but he continued to see a few patients till he moved in March 1841 to Hampstead, where he died on 12 May of pulmonary consumption. He was buried in the cemetery at Highgate. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in June 1832, and was a corresponding member of several foreign societies. When he retired, his professional income was ¬£4,000 per year. He was a member of the Church of England, and had strong religious convictions. Works In 1829 Hope began to publish a series of papers, building up to a projected work on the heart. Four papers on Aneurisms of the Aorta, based on Observations as House Physician and House Surgeon to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, appeared in the London Medical Gazette, 1829, and in 1830 he sent to the same journal four papers relating especially to the sounds of the heart and the physiology of its action. He also wrote for the Cyclop√¶dia of Practical Medicine about the same time the articles \\"Aorta, Aneurism of\\", \\"Arteritis\\", \\"Dilatation of the Heart\\", \\"Heart, Diseases of\\", \\"Heart, Degeneration of\\", \\"Heart, Hypertrophy of\\", \\"Palpitation\\", \\"Pericarditis and Carditis\\", and \\"Valves of the Heart, Diseases of\\"; these were not published till 1833‚Äì1835. Hope's major work came out at the end of 1831 (dated 1832) with the title A Treatise on the Diseases of the Heart and Great Vessels; comprising a new view of the Physiology of the Heart's Action, according to which the physical signs are explained. The book was well received internationally, and it was translated into German by an old Edinburgh friend, Ferdinand Wilhelm Becker. A third edition appeared in 1839, corrected and enlarged, and with the addition of plates; and a fourth edition in 1849, after his death, with additions and corrections, but without the plates, and in a cheaper form. Hope's conclusions about the sounds of the heart became widely accepted. His usage of the term \\"myosclerosis\\" was, however, unclear. Hope also based a work about morbid anatomy on his own drawings. The first part appeared at the beginning of 1833, and the last at the end of the following year. With articles in medical periodicals, he contributed the article on Inflammation of the Brain to Alexander Tweedie's Library of Medicine.

She is the sixth character to assume the Beetle alias, and the daughter of Tombstone. Janice Lincoln made her live-action debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), played by Claire Rushbrook. Publication history Janice Lincoln first appeared as the new Beetle in Captain America #607 (August, 2010), and was created by writer Ed Brubaker and artist Jackson \\"Butch\\" Guice. Beetle features as one of the main characters in Superior Foes of Spider-Man where her real name is revealed. Fictional character biography Janice Lincoln is the daughter of the super powered mobster Tombstone. Janice's mother was an ex-girlfriend of Tombstone during his early days in organized crime. Janice grew with a semi regular life with Tombstone showing up sporadically, usually to help out with bills and schooling. Janice idolized her father and his criminal activities, but was forbidden to take part in them. After building a successful career as a defense attorney, she was appointed to defend Baron Zemo, at which point she volunteered to work for him as the new Beetle. Janice's armor is also revealed to have been built by the Fixer.Superior Foes of Spider-Man #7. Marvel Comics. Helmut Zemo and the Fixer provided Janice with the Beetle armor and a nano- virus as part of their plan to destroy the new Captain America. The new female Beetle is seen at the end of Captain America #606. She emerges from the rubble of an explosion she causes to confront Captain America (Bucky) and Black Widow. The new Beetle fights Bucky and Black Widow in a short battle and is defeated. Bucky unmasks her, and realizes she is culpable in using the nano- virus on him. She is imprisoned in The Raft, where she reveals that she knows Captain America and Bucky are one and the same. While Janice resists Bucky and the Widow's attempts to interrogate her for the identity of her employer, the Fixer asks Zemo whether they should punish her for her failure. Zemo is merciful, saying that she knows no information that would hurt them. Janice is left to her own devices, and the heroes still manage to piece together Zemo's identity. However, Zemo still exposes Captain America's true identity to the general public. As part of the Marvel NOW! event, she is now a member of Boomerang's Sinister Six. After being defeated by Superior Spider-Man (Otto Octavius's mind in Peter Parker's body), Boomerang is secretly contracted by the Chameleon to recover the head of former Maggia leader Silvermane from the Owl. To this end, Boomerang deceives the team into agreeing to help him. However, after the original Beetle, the reformed Abe Jenkins, is assigned to be Boomerang's parole officer, the team vote him out and Janice as their new team leader. Speed Demon's vote is motivated by his unrequited attraction for her. The others note that the Beetle becomes more despotic as team leader, but attribute this as a reaction to the pressure to succeed and avoid incarceration. Boomerang secretly notifies Power Man and Iron Fist of the Sinister Six's whereabouts. Janice and her teammates are arrested, but Boomerang frees them in transit to jail and reclaims his leadership role. In this appearance, her first name is revealed to be Janice.The Superior Spider- Man #1. Marvel Comics. After assaulting the Owl's base the Beetle, Overdrive and Speed Demon were captured by the villain and interrogated. The Beetle tried to blackmail the Owl into releasing them while covertly dialing for back-up. Unimpressed, the Owl got ready to execute her when reinforcements arrived in the form of Tombstone, where it is later revealed that she is his daughter.Superior Foes of Spider-Man #6. Marvel Comics. Janice appears at Stark Industries after the events of The Superior Foes of Spider-Man, claiming to have reformed, and applying for the open Head of Security position alongside Prodigy, Victor Mancha, and Scott Lang. After seducing Iron Man, Janice tries to assassinate him at the behest of an unidentified client, but she is disarmed by Lang, and pursued and presumably apprehended by Iron Man. During the \\"Last Days\\" part of the Secret Wars storyline, Janice appears in Miami where she and a despondent Lang have a drunken tryst as the world is destroyed by the final Incursions between Earth-616 and Earth-1610. Janice Lincoln appeared in the courthouse as a lawyer representing Mysterio following his failed alien invasion plot. In a prelude to the \\"Hunted\\" storyline, Beetle is among the animal-themed characters captured by Taskmaster and Black Ant for Kraven the Hunter's upcoming Great Hunt.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #16. Marvel Comics. When she tries to flee the Hunter-Bots, Beetle hits the forcefield surrounding Central Park.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #18. Marvel Comics. Janice Lincoln meets the Francine Frye version of Electro where she states that she is offering her membership. Janice learned how Francine got her powers as Janice tells her that she is Tombstone's daughter. Janice states that they are building an organization that values and respects the female contributions to the side of evil. Outside of the mentor-ship programs, salons, and a child care facility, Janice states that they had a teleconference Black Mariah from prison and are trying to make contact with Morgan le Fay. Janice then proceeds to introduce Francine to the rest of the team consisting of Lady Octopus, Scorpia, Trapstr (who is deciding if she will replace the E with an A), and White Rabbit. Francine was reluctant to join up with them until Janice states that their first mission has them targeting Boomerang. The Sinister Syndicate begins their mission where they attack the F.E.A.S.T. building that Boomerang is volunteering at.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #26. Marvel Comics. Boomerang tries to reason with Beetle and Electro who are still made at him for betraying him. Beetle states that they aren't targeting F.E.A.S.T., they are targeting him. Beetle leads the Sinister Syndicate in attacking Boomerang. After getting Aunt May to safety, Peter Parker changes into Spider-Man and helps Boomerang fight the Syndicate. The Syndicate starts doing their formation attack until Spider-Man accidentally sets off Boomerang's gaserang which knocks out Spider-Man enough for the Syndicate to make off with Boomerang. As Beetle has Electro write a proposal on how the Syndicate can use Boomerang as an example to the criminal underworld, Beetle leaves while calling Wilson Fisk that they caught Boomerang as she is given the information on where the exchange can happen. Spider-Man goes to visit Randy Robertson and finds him making out with Beetle.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #27. Marvel Comics. As Spider-Man secretly watches them, Randy learns that Janice's Syndicate kidnapped Boomerang and what had transpired at the F.E.A.S.T. building. He tells Janice that she needs to let Boomerang go. Beetle leaves stating that he would not use her disintegrator ray on him because she is nice to Randy. As she flies, Beetle contacts Mayor Wilson Fisk stating that she is sending him the coordinates to Boomerang's location. When Beetle meets up with the Syndicate, they hear Mayor Fisk outside stating that they are harboring a criminal and are to surrender Boomerang to him or suffer the full might of New York City. After reading the paper in Boomerang's hand that belonged to Mayor Fisk, Beetle tells the Syndicate that they should let Boomerang go. While Beetle claimed that she betrayed them, she did it because she's a supervillain and states that she plans to have Kingpin deputize them. The rest of the Syndicate is not up with this plan. Trapstr later stated that she learned about Beetle's boyfriend by hacking her e-mails. The Syndicate then assists Spider-Man against Mayor Fisk's forces. Beetle has Spider-Man evacuate Boomerang while the Syndicate fights Mayor Fisk's forces while not killing them. The Syndicate is defeated and arrested by the police. Their transport is then attacked by an unknown assailant who frees them. At the F.E.A.S.T. building where men working for Mr. Stone are helping to rebuild the building, Aunt May mentioned to Randy Robertson that a high-powered lawyer got Councilman Galazkiewicz to expedite a permit request in exchange for not suing the city on F.E.A.S.T.'s behalf. Randy learns that the lawyer is Janice who invites them to brunch this weekend. Beetle is briefly seen on the nearby rooftop as Randy sees her while accepting the brunch invite.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #28. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities The Beetle suit grants superhuman strength and durability, allows the wearer to fly and stick to walls. Janice's armor seems to be loosely based on the armor designed by the Tinkerer for Abe Jenkins after his original Beetle armor was destroyed by Iron Man. However, the Zemo/Fixer costume does not seem to have the electro-byte offensive capability or the internal battle computer of Jenkins' suit. In her initial appearance, she uses military-grade weaponry to ambush Bucky and the Black Widow.

Life  Aitken was born in Paisley, Scotland, on July 11, 1764. She was the first of four children (two girls and two boys) that grew to adulthood in the family.AncestryLibrary.com/Ancestry Family Trees of Robert Aitken (1062236441) and Jane Aitken (1062242472): Clements, Jeffrey William Family Tree Her father was Robert Aitken (1734‚Äì1802), a Scottish stationery and book merchant who later became a Philadelphia printer and bookbinder. Her mother's maiden name was Janet Skeoch. Aitken and her family were among several Scottish families that emigrated to Colonial America in 1771. The Aitken family settled in Philadelphia, their port of arrival. =Business career= Aitken was involved with her father's Philadelphia publishing business, which consisted of a print shop and bindery. Her handwritten bookkeeping shows the print shop printed a newspaper, journals, books, and stationery. She inherited the printing business from her father's estate after his death in 1802 when she was thirty- eight years of age. The publications were there after in her own name as Printed by Jane Aitken from her printing business, which she ran on Third Street in Philadelphia. Her father's estate came with a heavy debt that was incurred from notes he had signed for. The debt was $3,000. Her brother, Robert Aitken Jr., who was a year younger than she and had been disowned by their father, was financially incapable to assist in this debt. Jane, being the oldest child, assumed the responsibility of caring for her two younger sisters, as her mother had previously died. She never married. Aitken's bookbinding business sometimes gave more support to the family than the actual printing part of the business. She bound many of the books she printed up for the Athenaeum of Philadelphia and some 400 volumes for the American Philosophical Society. The binding work of the 1780s to 1802 from her father's shop shows similarity to her binding work from 1802 to 1812 and shows that perhaps she did most if not all the binding work from his shop when she was younger. = Later life = John Vaughan, a friend of hers and a librarian from the American Philosophical Society, gave her much work and even some financial assistance, but her business failed in 1813 and her equipment was sold off. Vaughan bought the equipment at a sheriff's sale and leased it back to her at under the going market rate, however after she failed again in 1814, she was put into debtors' prison at the Norristown Jail, 20 miles outside Philadelphia. She is mostly unheard of in historical records other than the \\"late printer\\" until her death record of 1832 appearing in an obituary in Germantown, Pennsylvania. Her burial place is assumed to be in the destroyed cemetery of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, of which she was a member.  Legacy  Aitken was the first woman in the United States to print an English translation version of the Christian Bible. This bible is known as Thomson's Bible, being translated by the famous US revolutionary Charles Thomson.  Works  Aitken published at least sixty works from 1802 to 1812. Some of her works are: File:Preserving Health 1803.jpgAn epistle to a friend, on the means of preserving health ...(1803) File:Female Association 1803.jpgThe constitution of the Female Association of Philadelphia ...(1803) File:Mandamus 1803.jpgCommonwealth vs. Tench Coxe, Esq.

It was a punitive expedition led by Colonel Frank D. Baldwin in retaliation for murders committed by Moros in Malabang and Parang on the island of Mindanao.Arnold, J.R., 2011, The Moro War, New York: Bloomsbury Press, Col. Baldwin led seven companies of the 27th Infantry and the 25th Battery Light Artillery against the Moros on the south shore of Lake Lanao, the village of Bayan in particular. The Americans took Fort Pandapatan and the fort of Datu of Binadayan, killing the Sultan of Bayan in the process.  Background  The Moros accused the Americans of trying to convert them from Islam to Christianity, just like the Spanish attempts, and held a grudge from 1900 when troops under Lt. Col. L. M. Brett killed Datu Amirul. There was also a misunderstanding as to the extension of the Bates Agreement of 1899 to mainland Mindanao in which the Americans thought they had established sovereignty by getting the signature of the Sultan of Sulu, The Moros of Lanao is another sovereign and thought they can continue their rule. Right before the American insular government in the Philippines were about to declare the Philippines \\"pacified\\" or \\"assimilated\\", incidents of violence in the southern Island of Mindanao sparked the opening of a whole new front of the recently concluded Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, the so-called Moro rebellion had begun. Although Generals like Leonard Wood attempted to negotiate with the local Datus of Moroland, some Datus weren't interested in giving up their sovereignty to these new colonisers, hostilities almost immediately broke out with minor incidents of murder and stealing of weapons from the Americans stationed there. The expedition to Bayang was said to be a retaliation to two murders, 3 weeks apart, the perpetrators were Moros or Muslim Filipinos who were hoping to obtain the Americans' Krag-Jorgensen rifle. In response, Baldwin took his entire command of 1,025 men on the expedition and added the 25th Battery of the Field Artillery (65 men), ten six-mule teams and 40 pack mules run by contract civilian packers, and 300 hired cargadores. 600 men of the 10th and 17th Infantry Regiments were moved to Malabang as temporary replacements for his forces and to serve as a reserve.  March to Bayan  By late April, Baldwin had established a base at the port of Malabang, and planned to march north along the Mataling River to Lake Lanao. They set up headquarters at the old Spanish fort called \\"Corcuera\\". As they marched towards Bayan, they encountered thick jungles, seemingly bottomless mud pits and tropical diseases like Malaria plagued the expedition, from there, the Americans knew that they were going to encounter an entirely different kind of warfare in Mindanao, superior arms was an advantage for the American army, however the combat in Mindanao would often be fought at hand-to-hand confrontations and suicidal, so-called Juramentado and amok attacks. Once they finally reached the 2 forts at Bayan and Pandapatan, the number of effective guns had dropped to 600 and they had lost their Maguindanao cargadores and replaced them with an additional 40 pack mules, 80 in total. When they got to know that the beans in cans had a mix of pork in it, the bearers refused to carry the American rations of canned pork and beans. The American force reached the lake after a trek of seventeen days over thirty-two miles. Establishing a camp two miles from Bayan on 1 May, Baldwin sent an ultimatum to the Sultan asking for the surrender of the murderers of his soldiers. As they observed the high ridge overlooking Lake Lanao where the two forts or \\"Cottas\\" were built upon, some 1,000 yards apart, The American commanders quickly began planning for the assault, sending reconnaissance parties to gather information on the forts and their defenses, the first and highest fort was called \\"Binadayan\\" the bastion of the Sultan of Bayang who openly wrote against the American occupation and called for armed rebellion, on this fort they could see Maranao riflemen perched on the walls, the red flag of the Maranaos symbolizing a state of war was seen flying over both forts. The larger Cotta, named Pandapatan was the main defense of the Maranao army, under their war leader, the Sultan of Pandapatan. = Assault on Binadayan Cotta = Fifteen minutes after the ultimatum expired at noon, Baldwin's men‚ÄîCompany F (1st Lt. Thomas Vicars) and Company H (Captain Samuel Lyon) ‚Äî started their attack of the Moro fort on Lempesses Hill. The siege of Binadayan lasted about an hour, the Americans first tried firing over the parapets to cut down the defenders on the walls, afterwards, they charged the fort, after an hour the Americans captured the fort, with only 1 American killed and a small number of Moros killed. As the Americans discovered, The Sultan of Bayan and the remaining 600 men (including 150 men sent by other Datus) had moved across the valley to the larger Pandapatan Cotta, where they prepared for the impending assault. Knowing that the Americans easily captured the higher fort, they prepared for a heavy beating, but with the Moros having the main advantage, they were confident in their defense. = Capture of Pandapatan Cotta = Proceeding to the second fort, the Americans crossed three trench lines and surrounded the fort by 4 PM. The Moros set up an impressive defense of the Cotta, with deep trenches five feet deep surrounding the cotta, and the stone walls surrounded by sharpened bamboo stakes along with concealed pits filled with sharpened bamboo; the defense of Pandapatan was poised to halt the advancing Americans. When the Americans commenced their assault, they managed to take out a number of defenders on the walls of the fort, but lacking scaling ladders and running low on ammunition, Hugh A. Drum led an attempt to scale the walls. Company F assaulted the main gate of the fortification, and there a fierce counterattack was launched by the Moros. Company F commanding officer 1st Lieutenant Thomas Vicars was suddenly decapitated by lantaka fire, halting the American advance. Though the Americans inflicted heavy casualties on the Moros, the close-up hand-to-hand battle outside the walls continued until sunset, when the Americans retreated under the cover of night. On the way back to camp near the ruins of the Binadayan cotta, flashes of lightning, accompanied by heavy fog and a deluge of rain made life miserable for the Americans. As the Americans withdrew to Binadayan, the 25th Field Artillery courageously crawled on to the battlefield and retrieved the dead and wounded, although they were beaten back and suffering from heavy rain and fog, they inflicted massive damage to the fort and to the morale of the Moros defending it. As the fog cleared, the next morning dawned sunny to reveal the red battle flags replaced by four white flags. The Americans occupied the fort by 6 AM and took eighty-three prisoners, but the sultan and his chief lieutenant were killed trying to escape. The fort was later destroyed by American forces.  Aftermath  The prisoners tried to escape at 1 PM, resulting in all but nine being killed. President Roosevelt on 5 May sent his thanks for the men who \\"carried our flag to victory.\\" Both forts were dismantled by the Americans, and looting of Moro blades like the Kris and Kampilan, this practice of taking \\"souvenirs\\" from battle sites became common place among Americans fighting in Moroland. This first battle at Bayan became the rallying call of the Moros across Mindanao, with the continuing presence of American troops sparking various uprisings and attacks across the islands of Sulu, the Lanao lake and the Cotabato Basin. Camp Vicars (thus named after the slain Company F commander, 1st Lieutenant Thomas Vicars) was established by the Americans the next day near where the forts were located and John J. Pershing assumed command. Pershing made punitive expeditions against the Sultan Uali of Butig on 18-22 Sept. 1902 and the Sultan Cabugatan of Maciu on 29 Sept.-3 Oct. 1902. This was followed by expeditions against Bacolod, 6‚Äì8 April 1903, and Calahui, 9‚Äì10 April, on the western shore of the lake, and Taraca, 4‚Äì5 May, on the eastern shore. In the meantime, a supply road was built by Robert Lee Bullard's men from Iligan to Camp Marahui on Lake Lanao.  Reactions  The battle was lauded by the American press and the Roosevelt Administration as a signal victory, the resisting Maranaos described as having been \\"thoroughly whipped\\" and taught a \\"salutary lesson\\" after losing between 300-400 killed versus eleven killed and forty severely wounded for the Americans. But Baldwin's immediate superior, Brigadier General George W. Davis, and the commanding officer of the Philippine Department, Major General Adna Chaffee, were greatly upset and angered by Baldwin's conduct; believing he had acted impetuously, with insubordination, and ineptly, which could have easily ended in a major disaster. Behind the scenes President Roosevelt was furious with General Chaffee for having apparently allowed an entirely new front to open up just as he was about to proclaim the Philippine Islands were finally pacified and peaceful after a grinding, -year-long, less than popular war. In addition it undercut a slower yet progressively more successful attempt initiated by Davis to negotiate a peaceful solution through the efforts of Captain John J. Pershing. In fact Chaffee believed that had it not been for Pershing's last minute success in convincing the most powerful datus at the north end of the lake not to join in the defense of Bayan, Baldwin's expedition might have been a disaster. This prompted Chaffee towards an exceptional decision; to see to it that Baldwin was promoted up and out of Moroland and to turn over the Lanao mission to this same unknown junior officer.

The inscription indicates it was cast on 24 June 1038. It hangs in the Catherine Tower (German: Katharinenturm) in the ruins of the monastery of Bad Hersfeld in Hesse. In 2002 the bell tower was repaired by the Friends of the Stiftsruine (monastery ruins). As part of the works the old clapper was removed and hung in the Stadtsmuseum. A new clapper has been fitted and the bell can now be rung. The bell is suspended from a new yoke and is rung by pulling on ropes. History For centuries the Lullus bell was rung at the beginning of Lullusfest, a folk festival held in Hersfield. The festival commemorates Saint Lullus (born about 710 in Wessex, England) who was the first Abbot of Hersfeld Abbey, Germany and the first archbishop of Mainz. He died 16 October 786 in Hersfeld. Eventually the bell acquired its name from the festival. Until the renovation of 2002, the bell was also rung only once a year, at the start of the festival. Since then however, it has been rung on special occasions. It is rung at Christmas, Easter, Whitsun and the Lullus festival. Description The bell is high (excluding the crown) and in diameter. The weight is approximately . The sound is principally two notes beating together: B0 and C1. The bell is approximately tubular with vertical sides and a very small sound bow. The top of the bell is domed. Around the shoulder are three ridges, between the outermost two is an inscription. A further string is cast in just above the sound bow. The bell is suspended from cannons (cast in hoops). The cannons are attached to a beam, the headstock. Fixed to the top of the beak are two poles, one of which can be seen in the attached photograph. A rope hangs from the outboard end of each pole and runs through a hole in the floor to the ringers below. The ringers pull on the ropes alternately to swing the bell to and fro. =Inscription= The inscription is not completely clear. It is based on Latin, but with conventional abbreviations. There is no marked start of the inscription. In one area changes to the mould prior to casting have erased the text. The visible text reads: There is some dispute over the interpretation of the text. The \\"SD\\" in \\"SDANE\\" is thought to be an \\"M\\". Reconstructed the text appears to be three hexameters: The second year of Abbot Meginhar was 1038 and the bell would appear to have been poured on the feast day of John the Baptist (24 June).

Life She was born in Calcutta, where her father, John Williamson Fulton (1769‚Äì1830), was at the time a prosperous merchant; her mother was Anne, daughter of Robert Robertson, and widow of Captain John Hunt of the Bengal army, and she was the second of four daughters. At an early age she was sent from India to Lisburn, County Antrim, where her father's family resided. On her parents' return home, she settled with them in Upper Harley Street, London. In London, Fulton met her father's friends, Daniel O'Connell, John Lawless, and other Irish parliamentary leaders. She married in 1831, and was widowed in 1841. Her health led her to spend time in Madeira between 1842 and 1850. There she studied church history, and in November 1850 she became a Roman Catholic. Making the acquaintance of W. G. Ward and John Dobree Dalgairns, Hope lived for a time at Edgbaston, so as to be near the latter and John Henry Newman at the Birmingham Oratory. She later settled at Torquay. Although permanently disabled by a spinal complaint, she continued to write. She died at St. Mary- church, Torquay, on 2 February 1887. Works Anne Hope assisted her husband in some of his publications. After his death in 1841 she prepared a memoir of him, which Dr. Klein Grant edited (1844); it went to four editions. A series of letters on self-education which she addressed to her son was published in 1842 and reissued in 1846. In 1850 Hope completed, but did not publish, a work on the early Christian church in the first three centuries AD. She published in 1855 The Acts of the Early Martyrs, based on Pedro de Ribadeneira's Flores Sanctorum, and intended for the use of the schools connected with the Birmingham Oratory. It passed through five editions. In 1859 appeared her life of St. Philip Neri, which soon reached a third edition. Hope completed a life of St. Thomas √† Becket in 1868, and a scholarly work on the Conversion of the Teutonic Race 1872 (2 vols.); for both works Dalgairns wrote a preface. She wrote articles in the Dublin Review between 1872 and 1879, replying there to James Anthony Froude's attack on St. Thomas √† Becket in 1876. Her Franciscan Martyrs in England appeared in 1878. In 1894 Francis Aidan Gasquet edited from Hope's manuscript her First Divorce of Henry VIII. Family In 1831 Anne Fulton married James Hope, who died in 1841. in 1843 she published a 22-page memoir of her husband. Theodore Hope was their only son.

They took place between 1919 and 1927, but their background extends to the early 19th century. Britain signed a number of treaties with Bahrain in 1820, 1861, 1880 and 1892. The latter two had effectively turned Bahrain into a British Protectorate. Earlier in 1869, Britain had appointed the young Shaikh Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa as ruler. Shaikh Isa was an autocrat and a feudal overlord whose authority was shared with his family and Sunni tribal allies. The economy was dependent on pearl diving and palm farming. Both sectors suffered from great inequalities; the conditions of the mostly Baharnah (Shia) peasants and the mostly non- Bahraini divers were often compared to slaves. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the British influence in Bahrain has been on the rise; in 1904-5 they extended their jurisdiction over all foreigners and in 1913 issued an Order in Council, which effectively turned Bahrain into a colony. The Order was not implemented until after the end of World War I. The reforms began in February 1919 after the British Political Agent, Captain Bray announced that the Order was effective. Bray's next step to appoint half members of al-Majlis al-Urfi, a council concerned with commercial disputes encountered opposition from Shaikh Isa which led to its suspension. In November, Major H. R. P. Dickson was appointed Political Agent. He introduced the Joint Court, the Municipal Council of Manama and resumed the meetings of al-Majlis al-Urfi. Dickson was resented by the ruler and his tribal allies, but enjoyed the support of Baharnah whom he encouraged to rise against their oppressors. In 1921, Major Daly was appointed Political Agent. Few months later, he started undermining the influence of Shaikh Abdulla, the youngest sons of Shaikh Isa in favor of his older brother and the heir apparent, Shaikh Hamad. Starting from mid 1921, Bahrain witnessed a series of petitions supporting and opposing the reforms. They were submitted to different British officials up to the Foreign Office. The supporting faction was composed of Daly, Shaikh Hamad, his supporters and the Baharnah. The Baharnah demanded equity, as they had to pay numerous discriminatory taxes and were subjected to maltreatment and oppression. The other faction, composed of Shaikh Isa, Shaikh Abdulla, tribesmen and pearl merchants opposed the reforms, because they were set to abolish their absolute powers and superior social class. Faced with Britain's inaction, the Baharnah staged an uprising in Manama in February 1922. Shaikh Isa agreed to most of their demands, but did not carry them out. The Al Dawasir tribe contacted Ibn Saud, asking for his help against the reforms. On the other hand, Persians launched media campaigns accusing Britain of overlooking the oppression of their co-religious Baharnah in Bahrain. The British position then changed and reforms were to be carried even against the wishes of Shaikh Isa. In May 1923, 3-day-riots broke in Manama between Persians and Najdis. Elsewhere, Al Dawasir and Al Khawalid branch of Al Khalifa ruling family attacked several Baharnah villages. The British intervened; they deposed the aging Shaikh Isa in favor of his elder son after he had refused to retire voluntarily. Al Dawasir and Al Khawalid resumed their attacks against Baharnah villages for which they were put on trial and found guilty. Al Dawasir migrated to Dammam in the mainland, while Al Khawalid were either banished for long years or sentenced to death in absentia after their escape. The remaining opponents of reforms continued their peaceful means of pressure which culminated in a congress held in October. The pro-reform faction responded with similar moves. The British banished the leaders of the aforementioned congress. With the end of all forms of opposition, the road was paved for implementation of the administrative reforms. They included customs, judiciary, police, pearl diving and land reforms. Daly took an important part in implementing reforms, that higher authorities cautioned him to not become the actual ruler. He left in 1926 after appointing Charles Belgrave as adviser to the ruler. Some reforms proved to successful, such as those in customs, while others were inadequate, such as those in police and judiciary. By the end of the 1920s, Bahrain had developed a modern administration. British officials occupied several leading positions in it. The reforms also empowered the Baharnah politically and lifted much of the inequalities they had suffered from. Critics of the reforms often state that Sunni groups remained dominant, but only had to change the way they exercised authority. Others analyzed the purpose of British intervention and the aforementioned congress. Background=Early Al Khalifa rule= Bahrain fell under the control of Al Khalifa in 1783, following the defeat of Nasr Al-Madhkur who ruled the archipelago as a dependency of Persia. The first Al Khalifa ruler, Ahmed ibn Muhammad ibn Khalifa (1783‚Äì96) was based in Al Zubara (modern day Qatar) and spent summers in Bahrain. Following his death, Ahmed's sons Salman and Abdulla moved to Bahrain; they co-ruled it as feudal estates and imposed taxes on the Baharnah population. Salman settled in Bahrain Island and Abdulla in Muharraq Island, each of them ruling independently. The Al Khalifa soon became split into two branches, Al-Abdulla and Al-Salman that engaged in open conflict between 1842 and 1846. Al-Salman branch was victorious and enjoyed complete rule of Bahrain. Until 1869, Bahrain was under threat of occupation by various external powers including the Wahhabis, Omanis, Ottomans, Egyptians and Persians, yet the Al Khalifa managed to keep it under their control.; . The Al-Abdulla branch continued to be a cause of threat until 1895. =Treaties with Britain= At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Britain, then the dominant power in the region was attempting to end piracy in the Persian Gulf in order to secure maritime trading routes to its East India Company in the Indies. In 1820, Britain signed the General Maritime Treaty with tribal chiefs of the Persian Gulf, including the Al Khalifa (at their request). By signing this treaty, Britain recognized Al Khalifa as \\"legitimate\\" rulers of Bahrain. Between 1820 and 1850, the Al Khalifa have repeatedly tried to persuade British authorities to provide full protection to Bahrain against external threats, but without avail. Britain wanted Bahrain to remain an independent state. The situation changed in 1859‚Äì60, when the Al Khalifa ruler appealed to the Persians and Ottomans to provide protection, and in 1861 blockaded Al-Hasa. This prompted the British in 1861 to force the ruler to sign a new treaty with Britain, the Perpetual Truce of Peace and Friendship; the ruler of Bahrain was not to engage in \\"prosecution of war, piracy and slavery at sea\\" and Britain was to provide maritime protection. The treaty also recognized the Al Khalifa ruler as an \\"independent ruler\\".; ; . Six years later, in 1867‚Äì8, the British navy intervened after a Bahraini attack on Qatar. After two years, in 1869, they intervened again to end an internal struggle over power, and appointed Shaikh Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa, then aged 21 as ruler of Bahrain. In subsequent years, the British exercised increasing control over Shaikh Isa's communications with foreign powers, especially the Ottomans, who had claims over Bahrain and Qatar. The increasing Ottoman influence in the region threatened the status quo in Bahrain and prompted Colonel Ross, the British Resident to sign a new treaty with Bahrain on 22 December 1880. The treaty prohibited the ruler of Bahrain from negotiating, signing treaties or accepting any form of diplomatic representation with foreign powers without British consent, with the exception of \\"customary friendly correspondence... of minor importance\\". It did not refer to Bahrain's independence.; . The Persian Gulf Residency headquarters in Bushire in 1902 Fearing the increasing Ottoman activity and French influence in the region, Britain signed a new treaty with Bahrain in 1892 which further limited the foreign relations of the ruler by prohibiting disposal of territory to any foreign power other than Britain. It also prohibited the minor communications exempted by the 1880 treaty. The treaties of 1880 and 1892 have effectively turned Bahrain into a British protectorate, giving the British control over defense and foreign relations. The ruler was also to accept British \\"advice\\" regarding internal matters. During this period, Bahrain was the center of British commercial operations in the region. Between 1829 and 1904, the Persian Gulf Residency appointed an Assistant post in Bahrain. It was occupied by natives until 1900 when a British was assigned to the post in order to accommodate the increase in British trade and attract British companies. The British were mainly concerned with their commercial interests and paid little attention to internal affairs.; ; ; . Britain is credited for the stability and growth Bahrain witnessed in the latter half of the 19th century. =Demographics= According to Lorimer, at the beginning of the 20th century (1905), the population of Bahrain was estimated at 100,000. Muslims formed the overwhelming majority (99%). The Sunni community who mostly lived in towns was estimated to form about 60% of the population, while the Shia community who mostly lived in villages were estimated at 40%. The largest city, Manama had 25,000 inhabitants (60% Shia and 40% Sunni), about 7,500 of them were foreigners. The inhabitants of Muharraq numbered 20,000. Bahrainis constituted 17,250 of them (5% Shia and 95% Sunni), while the remaining were foreigners. The majority of the rural population were Shia. The Sunni component was composed of the Al Khalifa family and its tribal allies who migrated to Bahrain in the late eighteenth century, and the Huwala who formed the largest segment of this component. The Shia community was mostly composed of Baharnah (sing. Bahrani), who were the oldest group that still inhabited the island. Baharnah were also the largest single community, followed by Huwala. The other Shia group is Persians, who formed a small minority.; ; . =Political system= Shaikh Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa, the ruler of Bahrain (1869‚Äì1923) Following the end of internal conflicts and external threats in 1869, the tribal rule in Bahrain was stabilized. According to Bahraini historian Khayri, during the first 20 years of Shaikh Isa's rule, authority was centralized. However, in 1889, after the death of his brother, Shaikh Ahmed, authority began to be distributed. The system resembled a \\"feudal estate system\\" in which authority was shared with different groups whose power was dependent on their economic resources. Authority was shared between various Al Khalifa Shaikhs, that Shaikh Isa could not control all of their actions. Also, the Al Khalifa also served as landlords; on one hand, the lands they directly administered were farmed out as fiefs and on the other they collected taxes on private lands. Land was divided into a number of fiefdoms which were administered by close relatives of the ruler, each of them enjoying a high level of autonomy within it, almost as high as the ruler himself.; ; . Within his fiefdom, each ruler had the authority to claim corv√©e (i.e. forced labor, known locally as sukhrah), collect taxes and resolve contentions. He was helped in conducting these tasks by three main administrative staff: fidawis, wazirs and kikhdae. The former was the military arm of the authority whose main job was to execute rulers orders via physical coercion. They were led by a number of Amirs who were appointed by the ruler. Fidawis were composed of Baluchis, African slaves and Sunni Arabs whose tribal origin could not be traced.; . Fidawis collected taxes, rents and tributes from cities, were responsible for rounding up adult males for forced labor and had powers to arrest, interrogate and punish. Their arbitrary way of taking the law into their hands and use of violence were a source of terror throughout Bahrain, especially to the Baharnah. In the 1920s, many complaints by reform supporters were concerned with fidawis.; . The other two staff, kikhdae and wazirs were tax collectors in villages and proxies for renting palm gardens respectively. They belonged to the Baharna, were wealthy and had a leading position in society, but in villages that were heavily taxed they were so hated that they escaped to Manama following reforms of the 1920s. Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa, the heir apparent and elder son of Shaikh Isa The ruler, Shaikh Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa was distinguished from the other Al Khalifa by the larger amount of resources he controlled; he had the cities of Muharraq and Manama as well as many fiefdoms under his control. He held absolute powers; he was described as an \\"autocrat\\" who \\"could order collective punishment of [a] village\\", especially if it was a Shia one. He regularly gave away entire villages as gifts to other Al Khalifas. He ruled from Muharraq, except for the summer months when he moved to Manama. His main source of income was from customs. Other sources of income included agricultural and inheritance transfer taxes. He also ruled over markets and ports, and treated all public revenues as private earnings. Much of the revenue was spent on his retinue and so little or none at all on infrastructure, and when it occurred, it was thought of as an act of charity.; ; . The heir apparent was the oldest son of Shaikh Isa, Shaikh Hamad, appointed in the position in 1896. However, the younger son, Shaikh Abdulla was Shaikh Isa's \\"trusted agent\\". Shaikh Khalid, the younger brother of Shaikh Isa was the governor of Riffa. He also controlled Sitra island, Nabih Saleh and was dependent for his income on the poll tax, exclusively levied on Baharnah. Shaikh Khalid was the most independent fief overlord. Authority-related jobs were exclusive to the Sunnis whereas market- related were confined to Baharnah and foreigners. =Economy= The main economic resources back then, pearl diving, fishing and palm farming were administered by tribal councils, with Shaikh Isa's council being the most influential. Most fishing trap owners and palm farmers were Baharna, who formed the lowest layer of the social strata.; . They were the only group which had to pay a number of taxes including, but not limited to: poll tax (also known as neck tax and ragbiyyah, levied on Baharnah males), water tax, fish tax and Muharram tax.; . Most lands were seized by Al Khalifa and Baharnah farmers had to rent them. Some Baharnah families who were allied to the Al Khalifa were allowed to keep their lands, but were required to pay a heavy land tax. Even this latter group was not spared from occasional confiscation of land for \\"no valid reason\\". Palm farming was the only source of subsistence for many Baharnah families which were always left with no more than the essentials of survival, because rents were dependent on yield, increasing and decreasing with it. Those who failed to pay rents were \\"summarily evicted from their homes and in some cases [were] beaten and imprisoned as well\\". They also had to look after the cattle of the rulers and provide food to any Al Khalifa that passes by. They were subject to attacks by bedouins and Al Khalifa, were subjected to corv√©e and their women were \\"apt to be molested\\". The conditions of Baharnah were described to be \\"little better than landless serfs\\" and \\"virtually serfs\\". British officials described Baharnah peasants as \\"shamefully rack-rented peasantry\\" and \\"their condition resembled that of helots, who could call no lands nor the produce of any land their own\\".; . On the other hand, pearl diving was controlled by Sunni Arab tribesmen, who had their own estates, enjoyed a high level of autonomy and freedom of operation within them, and were not directly taxed. Only few Baharnah were engaged in this occupation. The most powerful tribe was Al Dawasir who lived in Budaiya and Zallaq; they were wealthy, numerous and only second in power to Al Khalifa;; ; . they had 400 manpower, while the total manpower of Al Khalifa was 540. They had a pearling fleet and many divers. They were allied to other tribes residing in Eastern Arabia. When Al Dawasir migrated to Bahrain from central Arabia in 1845, they expelled the Baharnah living in the north west side of the island. In the years preceding administrative reforms, they had stopped paying the diving tax, which used to be \\"small\\" and paid in \\"reduced form\\". Shaikh Isa \\"was too nervous of Ibn Saud's intervention to insist on them\\". Charles Belgrave described them as \\"fine-looking men, tall, handsome and arrogant, and they terrorized the villages in the neighborhood\\". Al Hidd was also an important pearl center. It was controlled by Al Khalifa. Pearl diving produced enormous amounts of cash and recruited a large portion of the population (up to 70% of working males). The annual pearl export increased by 700% between 1873 and 1900. It was the pillar of Bahraini economy. The pearling boat captain, known as Nakhuda was of tribal origin, while the crew were mostly non-Bahraini. The crew, which had to endure hard work and face hazards of the sea only received a small part of the share, while merchants and Nakhudas got most of it. A special court, known as the salifa presided over matters relating to pearling.; . Salifa was always headed by a judge of tribal origin and was biased in favor of merchants and Nakhudas, who were also of tribal origin. At the beginning and end of each diving season, the Nakhuda would give loans to the crew. These loans were very important for the diver's family during and after the season. Loan interests were very high and increased with pearl catch, thus the crew were almost always in debt to the Nakhuda. Because debts were hereditary from fathers to sons and brothers, most divers (90%) were stuck in the system. This system was described by one British official as \\"a form of slavery\\".; . Another described it as \\"bondage and oppression\\" and \\"like slavery\\", especially for older people, who had to work despite getting physically weaker. In 1913, many drivers went to sea without Nakhudas. The latter, especially those who belonged to Al-Dawasir tribe complained to Shaikh Isa, who sent orders to the divers to return immediately. Merchants were influential and their elites played an important role in the sustainability of the tribal regime. Their financial power was often superior to that of the ruler. Tribal merchants, who monopolized the pearl industry were at the top of the hierarchy, while Baharnah merchants were the lowest. The latter merchants acted mainly as middlemen for pearl trade and were known as tawawish. They were vulnerable to \\"arbitrary dispossession and extortion\\" as can be seen from the case of Ahmad bin Khamis. Huwala merchants, while not enjoying the same privileges as tribal merchants had strong transnational networks that were sometimes reinforced by connections to the British Agency. The Huwala elite merchants such as Yusuf Kanoo and Yusuf Fakhro were exempt from import-export tax by Shaikh Isa, despite the large amount of commodities they dealt with. =Judiciary= Another informal court existed, known as al-Majlis al-Urfi (Customary council) which was concerned with commercial disputes. Shaikh Isa appointed members of both courts. Criminal and civil cases were dealt with by the Al Khalifa- controlled tribal councils, where customary law was applied. Religious matters were dealt with by religious courts which followed Sharia (Islamic law), derived from the Qur'an and Hadith. Appointed by Shaikh Isa, Jassim al-Mihza was the sole jurist that served the Sunni community. The Shia courts on the other hand were numerous and independent of the ruler. Shia jurists had tremendous social power, controlled the numerous Shia endowment properties and represented an alternative to the government as their followers looked upon them as the \\"legitimate\\" authority. The few European traders were under British jurisdiction. At some points, the British extended their jurisdiction over Bahrainis as well, but this was rare prior to 1904. Increasing British protection In 1903, Lord Curzon, then the Viceroy of India visited Bahrain and highlighted the need to reform the customs -which were in a state of chaos- by appointing a British director. The ruler, Shaikh Isa resisted what he considered an interference, after which Curzon told him they were persistent in their demands.; . Complaints about the customs were made as early as 1885 and remained a popular topic for British officials until the implementation of the administrative reforms in the 1920s. Throughout this period, Shaikh Isa resisted British control over customs in order to remain financially independent. In 1904, the post of British Assistant was elevated to British Political Agent. The British political agency, circa 1900 On 29 September, followers of Ali ibn Ahmed Al Khalifa, a nephew of Shaikh Isa attacked clerks working for a German trading firm. Ali himself attacked the German trader. On 14 November, his followers attacked and severely injured several Persians. The Political Agent asked Shaikh Isa to punish the aggressors and compensate the victims, but Shaikh Isa refused. After failing to get justice in Bahrain, the victimized parties referred their cases to the German Council in Bushire and the Persian Secretary for Foreign Affairs respectively.; . Fearing that these incidents would allow foreign powers to \\"gain an opening for assailing [the British] regime\\", Major Percy Cox, the Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf visited Bahrain in a navy fleet on 30 November. Shaikh Isa agreed to punish those behind the attack on the German firm, but not those who attacked the Persians. After consultations with higher British authorities, Cox returned to Bahrain in a great show of force on 23 February 1905. He issued an ultimatum ending on 25 February. Cox demanded deporting Ali, compensating the Persians, prohibiting forced labor of foreigners, and adhering to advises by the British Political Agent. He threatened to fire on Manama if Shaikh Isa did not comply. Shaikh Isa agreed to the demands on 26 February after Cox had fired few blank shots on Manama. In secret however, he allegedly warned Ali against his inevitable arrest. Finding that Ali was gone, Cox took the heir apparent, Shaikh Hamad as a hostage, imposed house arrest on Shaikh Isa and confiscated Ali's properties. He then arrested Jassim al-Mihza, the influential Sunni judge. Three days later, Cox was satisfied with the results as the population submitted to the British. Shaikh Hamad and al-Mihza were released and Shaikh Isa was freed from house arrest. Ali surrendered himself in July and was deported to Bombay in September.; ; . In January 1906, Cox extended the jurisdiction of the British Political Agent to Persians when he ruled that a Persian who was caught stealing from a British ship harbored in Bahrain fell under British jurisdiction. In April, the British further extended their jurisdiction to include Jews and native Christians after the former group complained of harassment over taxes by Shaikh Isa. According to one British official, all these judicial powers were \\"not authorized by any law\\". The full implications of these actions were not realized at first. Because all \\"foreigners\\" were placed under the British jurisdiction, an often-conflicted dual authority system was created, one led by the ruler, the other by the British Political Agency. During the time, there was an increasing number of foreigners due to the pearl boom which was coupled with stability. At the same time, the term \\"foreigner\\" lacked a precise definition; both Shaikh Isa and the British claimed non-Bahraini Arabs and Baharnah as their subjects. Shaikh Isa's motivations were political as well as financial, as he charged 10% of all cases fees. Shaikh Isa's reaction to this change was to postpone any reform to the customs which he thought of as \\"the darlings of British trade\\". The British attempted to use this atmosphere to their advantage; Captain Prideaux, the newly appointed Political Agent had been developing plans for administrative reforms. Unlike other British officials, he did not suggest changes in the customs or internal authority of Al Khalifa. Instead Prideaux proposed that reforms be focused on \\"ending local tyranny\\" in the form of forced labor, and judicial and financial corruption. His proposals were the basis of the Bahrain Order in Council, a document issued in 1913 that secured the legal status of Britain in Bahrain. At first, these plans were rejected by Cox, who thought they were premature. British officials thought that by 1908 Shaikh Isa would be forced to accept reforms in the customs due to the expiration of Banyan merchants contracts. However, in January 1908, the customs revenue increased when Shaikh Isa appointed local officials. Bahrain Order in Council and WWI Before late 1907, the British have not openly declared Bahrain a protectorate, instead they considered it under their protection. The Foreign Office refused to use \\"strict terms\\" to define the status of Bahrain. But in private correspondents between British officials, the term \\"protectorate\\" was often used since the 1890s. On 14 November 1907, the British Government of India requested issuing an Order in Council for Bahrain in light of the growing British jurisdiction over foreigners. Rising foreign interests and trade in the region, especially those of the Germans was another important motivation. In the request, the Government of India acknowledged that treatment of 1880 had turned Bahrain into \\"a sort of protectorate\\". In February 1908, the Foreign Office questioned if administrative reforms can be carried out along with formally acknowledging the increased British jurisdiction over Bahrain, so that the latter may not provoke any hostile reactions from other foreign powers. In March, a committee headed by John Morley, the Secretary of State for India was formed. It concluded in its final report that Bahrain was in fact a British \\"visual Protectorate\\" (but did not see fit to declare it publicly as so) and that the Order in Council should be issued following written consent from Shaikh Isa over the new status of British jurisdiction over foreigners. The report was approved in February 1909 and the Government of India was tasked on May with preparing a draft for the Order in Council. Shaikh Isa's consent was secured in July, however for various reasons, the draft was only submitted in June 1911. Further negotiations with Shiakh Isa and the Ottomans delayed the approval of the Order in Council until 12 August 1913.; . The Bahrain Order in Council (BOIC) was published in The London Gazette on 15 August. It provided legal cover for British jurisdiction over foreigners. It also limited the powers of the ruler and gave the Political Agent far reaching jurisdiction powers, including on religious law courts. John Marlowe stated that this had equated Bahrain's status to a British Colony and the British Political Resident's power to a Colonial Governor.; . Littlefield wrote the BOIC had made Bahrain \\"in all but name, a British colony\\" and that it aroused anti- British feelings. Six courts were to be formed: the Chief Court (Muslims), the District Court (foreigners), the Joint Court (Bahrainis vs foreigners), al- Majlis al-Urfi (only when disputing parties agreed to refer to it), Salifa Court (pearl diving) and Kazi's Court (cases could be referred to it from other courts). The applicable law was to be Indian law with some amendments. However, the BOIC was suspended due to negotiations with Ottomans and outbreak of the First World War. It was only put into effect in February 1919, announcing the start of the administrative reforms. The insignia of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire Few months before the war, Bahrain granted Britain exclusive oil concessions. During the war, most Bahrainis were not supportive to the Allies. The British thought this was due to their (the British) lack of attention toward Baharnah oppression and suspension of reforms. These anti-British feelings were another reason for delaying implementation of the Oder in Council until after the war. On the other hand, Shaikh Isa and his family, especially his younger son, Shaikh Abdulla were loyal to the British.; . Shaikh Isa was given the Companion (CIE) and Knight Commander (KCIE) of the Order of the Indian Empire in 1915 and 1919 respectively. Shaikh Abdulla too was given CIE in 1915. The situation within Bahrain was calm, but very hard at the same time; the customs income decreased by 80%, 5,000 died due to plague in Manama and Muharraq, and many others migrated. Many were brought to the \\"brink of famine\\" due to India's ban on exporting rice and the subsequent increase in staple commodities prices. Shaikh Isa responded in 1917 by borrowing from merchants, increasing the customs tax and dispossessing of Baharna, who were now the only non-Sunni group which did not enjoy British protection. At the time, Britain responded to external threats from the Wahhabis, Ottomans and Persians by tightening its grip over Bahrain. The latter two had longstanding claims over the island. Following the end of the war, Persian media launched a campaign calling for a stop to the oppressive policies against their co-religious Shia. By the end of the war, the Persian Gulf became \\"a British lake\\", as all enemies of Britain were defeated and its control was therefore left unchallenged. This marked a shift in the British policy in Bahrain toward more intervention in the island's internal affairs. Timeline of reforms=Captain Bray= The administrative reforms took place between 1919 and 1927. In November 1918, Captain N. N. E. Bray was appointed as Political Agent in Bahrain and instructed to \\"seek the amelioration of the internal government by indirect and pacific means and by gaining the confidence and trust of the shaikh\\". He was the first of three British officials to the post who were educated about \\"Arabic language, culture, and society.\\" This change in British policy was previously resisted by the Foreign Office and Government of India which preferred a \\"cautions policy\\".; . On 27 January 1919, the British Secretary of State telegramed the Government of India that the BOIC was to be commenced on 3 February. Bray was notified and he proceeded to inform Shaikh Isa on 1 February. Shaikh Isa simply acknowledged he had been notified about the BOIC without giving a positive or negative opinion, despite being given 2 days to consider. During these 2 days, Bray secured the approval of al-Mihza, the sole Sunni jurist. On 3 February, Bray announced to the public that BOIC was effective. Bray's first step to implement the BOIC was to appoint half members of the al-Majlis al-Urfi. On 2 April, Shaikh Isa sacked one of the aforementioned members without consulting with Bray. The latter protested against this move, as it was a breach of the BOIC. No compromise was reached as Shaikh Isa considered it his right as ruler to appoint members of al-Majlis al-Urfi. As a result, meetings of the al-Majlis al-Urfi were upheld indefinitely.; . Bray wrote that there were growing anti-British feelings in Bahrain for various reasons. He suggested forming a pro-British party to counter them. In May, Bray was to leave to London. He invited Shaikh Abdulla, the second son of Shaikh Isa from another wife to accompany him as a reward for his help during World War I and in order to learn about modern administration. Shaikh Abdulla however used the opportunity to mail Arthur Hirtzel, the Deputy Under Secretary of State for India when he arrived in London in September. He demanded among other things that his father's jurisdiction powers be restored to those prior to 1904. He signed the memorandum: \\"Abdulla bin Isa ‚Äî The Successor\\". He never delivered Shaikh Hamad's letter to King George V. After his return, Shaikh Abdulla opened al- Hidaya al-Khalifiyah, the first modern school in Bahrain and appointed an Egyptian, Haffez Wahbah as head.; ; =Major Dickson= Harold Richard Patrick Dickson (4 February 1881 ‚Äì 14 June 1959) In November, Major H. R. P. Dickson was appointed as Political Agent. His fluent Arabic and visits to their villages allowed him to establish strong relationships with Baharnah peasants, who told him about their grievances. Dickson encouraged them to rise against the tribal administration and promised that tyranny would end and that he would help them.; . He described Baharnah as \\"pro-British\\". He also strengthened his communication with the people by holding an Arab-style regular Majlis. Dickson stated that \\"British prestige rested on fear and not respect\\". In one of his reports, he described the political situation as \\"wholly unsatisfactory\\" with deep \\"anti-British sentiment\\". In the same report, he divided influential Bahrainis into \\"while list\\" and \\"black list\\", and the opposition into \\"honest\\" and \\"dishonest\\". In another report he listed the five most influential Bahrainis: Shaikh Isa, his wife, Shaikh Hamad, Shaikh Abdulla and Jasim al-Shirawi.; ; . Dickson was annoyed by Shaikh Isa's repeated talk of Wilson's Fourteen Points statement (he referred to it as \\"utterances\\") on the right of self-determination and independence of small nations. Dickson once requested that a British warship be occasionally sent to Bahrain in order to impress Shaikh Isa and \\"keep [British] prestige alive among a set of people who are only too apt to forget that the British Empire exists and does take an interest in Bahrain affairs\\". Shaikh Isa was also hostile to Dickson; the judges he appointed avoided any contact with Dickson and his fidawis prevented foreigners from contacting the agency, thus hindering the flow of intelligence. Dickson agreed with Shaikh Isa to resume the meetings of al-Majlis al-Urfi for six months to give time for the reply of the British Government. The first meeting was held in January 1920 with 10 members, half of them were Bahrainis appointed by Shaikh Isa and the other half were Persians and Indians appointed by Dickson. One of the latter group was Mohammed Sharif, who would play a more important role later. The court was given rule over trade, including pearl industry. It replaced the tribal salifa court in later years.; . In May, the Government of India sent reply to Shaikh Abdulla's earlier letter, rejecting all of his demands, except that of jurisdiction over non-Bahraini Arabs, on the condition that other Arab rulers agree. Dickson spared no time before contacting rulers of Saudi Arabia and Qatar regarding the matter. After getting their replies, in which they refused to give Bahrain jurisdiction over their subjects, Dickson announced in November that foreign subjects were under British protection. Municipality of Manama Dickson introduced two modern institution. The first was the Joint Court in 1919 headed by him and Shaikh Abdulla and concerned with cases of foreigners against Bahrainis. On 1 July, a Municipal Council (municipality) was formed in Manama with Shaikh Abdulla as head. Half of its 8 members were appointed by Shaikh Isa and the other half by Political Agent, and it was tasked with civil responsibilities. Fidawis were abolished and replaced by a small group of municipal guards. The opening session of the municipality witnessed a large demonstration against it. Dickson was dissatisfied with the proceedings of the municipality and accused Shaikh Abdulla and his Indian secretary of monopolizing decision-making. He introduced a new set of decision-making by-laws based on majority vote and appointed himself as ex officio member.; ; . Dickson also provided protection to some Bahraini women, which Al Dawasir powerful tribe saw as \\"humiliating and hurtful to their pride\\". These policies earned Dickson the enmity of the ruler, his son Abdulla, the tribes and Sunnis in general (conservatives and enlightened). The former two, along with other ruling Shaikhs resented Dickson, because of his interference in their traditional absolute authority, while the latter were motivated by local morals and nationalism. This opposition was translated into petitions sent to higher British offices and efforts to render the newly established offices inoperative. Petitions were mainly prepared by Haffez Wahbah, Jasim al-Shirawi and Abdul Wahab al-Zayani. On the other hand, foreigners and the Baharnah were supportive of the reforms. The former group felt safe under British protection and to them the reforms represented an organized regime. While the latter group had been longtime oppressed by the Al Khalifa and were agitated for liberty.; ; . =Major Daly= Shaikh Isa with his family and the British Political Agent, Major Daly. Dickson was relieved from duty at the end of 1920, which brought his opponents a short relief that was soon interpreted by his successor, Major Clive Kirkpatrick Daly. Prior to the arrival of Daly in January 1921, the position of the Political Agent was temporarily filled by an Indian assistant. During this period, the influence of the Agency became very low. Daly's first priority was to restore the Agency's power. He spoke fluent Arabic and had attended Shia religious classes in Iraq. During the first few months of his arrival in Bahrain, Daly did not purse reforms. He refused to provide protection to individuals and turned a blind eye to the tribal administration persecution and killing of Baharnah peasants whom Dickson had promised with salvation. Mohammed Al Tajir mentioned that the British Political Agency silence was the main motivation for continuation of oppression of Baharnah and described Daly's attitude as \\"trickery\\". Shaikh Isa was satisfied with Daly and sent a letter to the British Political Resident requesting his permanent fixation after rumors spread that Daly was getting transferred.; . Few months later, Daly targeted supporters of Shaikh Abdulla by sacking or deporting them, among them were Haffez Wahbah and Jasim al-Shirawi. Shaikh Abdulla represented \\"the symbol of tribal power\\", was supported by the tribes and was more influential than his elder brother, the heir apparent Shaikh Hamad. Shaikh Abdulla had ambitions to succeed his father in throne. Daly removed Shaikh Abdulla from the Joint Court and Municipality Council and placed Shaikh Hamad instead. He also appointed Shaikh Hamad as manager of public business, a move made in agreement with Shaikhs Isa and Abdulla. Daly then appointed a Persian merchant, Mohammed Sharif as secretary of Manama municipality and later as its head. Daly also provided protection to a growing number of individuals, especially the still‚Äìoppressed countryside Baharnah who sought to use this new status to voice their demands and grievances.; ; . Daly communicated with and organized the Baharnah community via a number of \\"brokers\\" (merchants). By mid 1921, Bahrain was divided into two main camps, the first supporting the reforms composed of Daly, Shaikh Hamad and his supporters (including Sunni jurist al- Mihza), and the Baharnah (urban and peasant). The opposing faction was composed of Shaikh Isa, his son Abdulla, tribesmen, pearl merchants and Nakhudas. Shaikh Salman, the son of Shaikh Hamad was also opposed to the reforms. The ruling family was divided on the matter. Haffez Wahbah attributed the conflict between Shaikh Isa's sons to the actions of Daly, while Hashim stated it was caused by Shaikh Isa's wife. A series of pro and anti reform petitions were submitted by the two factions to different British officials up to the Foreign Office. On 7 June, a delegation of Baharnah dignitaries submitted a petition to Daly, praising him in a lengthy poem and demanding the enforcement of reforms. The opposing faction petitioned that reforms be reversed and Daly and Shaikh Hamad be dismissed. The basis of Shaikh Isa's opposition to the reforms was that he did not want to give up the absolute powers he had enjoyed for the past 50 years. Other members of Al Khalifa, such as Shaikh Khalid, the brother of the ruler were dependent for their income on the poll-tax, which the reforms were set to abolish. Another source for Shaikh Khalid's opposition might have been his ambition to hold a senior position if Abdulla was to succeed Shaikh Isa instead of Shaikh Hamad. For tribes and pearl merchants, especially Al Dawasir, the basis of their rejection was that reforms would place them on same footing with other people with regard to taxation and law, thus removing all advantages they had enjoyed. They also saw the reforms as pro-Shia, undermining to their sovereignty and placing them under control of what they called \\"the British tribe\\".; . The basis of Shia's support for reforms was that they saw justice and fair taxation as their rights, especially since they considered themselves the original people of Bahrain. On 21 December, a group of Baharnah took advantage of the visit of the British Political Resident, Arthur Prescott Trevor in order to raise their grievances. They submitted a petition and told Trevor that should the British fail to persuade Shaikh Isa to accept reforms, then they (the British) should not protect him anymore and allow a new unnamed Arab ruler to be installed. The petition also asked to place Baharnah under British protection. It read: > We beg to state to the possessor of great wisdom, the chief of the Gulf, > that the Shi'a community is in a state of great humiliation, and subject to > public massacre, they have no refuge, the evidence of none of them is > accepted [in courts], their properties are subject to plunder, and > themselves liable to maltreatment at any moment. Upon a request by Trevor, Daly submitted a detailed report in which he listed examples of the mismanagement and corruption of the Al Khalifa as well as the \\"atrocities and oppressions\\" they had committed. He focused on Shaikh Abdulla's attitude towards Shia. Prior to the visit, Shaikh Isa had tried and failed to secure Shias' support to his regime. Trevor contacted the Government of India, suggesting more British intervention and temporary deportation of Shaikh Abdulla, who he blamed for the troubles facing the administration of Shaikh Hamad.; ; . In January 1922, he got a negative reply which stated that all local means of pressure should be exhausted before such measures were considered. Trevor was told to visit Bahrain in the near future to let Shaikh Isa know he was being closely monitored. He was also instructed to warn him that \\"if misrule leads to uprising Government will find it difficult to render him any support whatsoever\\". Baharnah staged another petition in January without avail. During the same month, several shots were fired on Manama police posts, which were attributed to the opponents of reforms. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, Shaikh Isa sought advice from Daly.; ; . =Baharnah uprising= On 6 February 1922, a group of Baharnah attacked a fidawi who according to Daly had unlawfully beaten and arrested one of their own in Manama. They released the detainee and staged a strike and some protests in Manama Souq that had brought it to a standstill.; . Mohammed Al Tajir stated that Baharnah strike was instructed by Daly and that it was very effective, because they controlled food and agriculture. He also mentioned that Baharnah were very confident at this time that they \\"hardened their tone and freely criticized\\" Shaikh Isa, his family and allies. This incident is referred to by Mahdi Al-Tajir and al-Shehabi as \\"The Baharnah uprising of February 1922\\".; . The uprising was classified by al-Mdaires as the most significant protest by Baharnah during the 1920s, and Matveev said it was \\"a land mark in the history of Bahrain\\". Shaikh Isa was \\"oblivious to the fact that he was sitting on a volcano,\\" Daly wrote. Shaikh Isa contacted Daly regarding the matter, who told him to speak with his subjects and avoid any escalation. On 16 February, a group of Baharnah delegates presented a list of 8 demands to Shaikh Isa. Among the demands were stopping the Shaikh's camels and calves from entering and destroying other's gardens, ending the practice of forced labor and arbitrary arrests.; ; . After 6 days of consultations with his family, Shaikh Isa accepted most of the demands. He however, refused to abolish the poll tax and improve the conditions of prisoners, but promised Baharnah 3 positions in al-Majlis al-Urfi. Shaikh Isa then established a public affairs office and a joint court to look after regular cases, which pacified the situation temporarily. Daly referred to this declaration as \\"The Magna Carta\\" and promised to support him in initiating reforms. In private, Daly was skeptical that promised reforms would actually be carried out. On 7 March, Trevor arrived to Bahrain in a warship and delivered separate warnings to Shaikh Isa and his sons Hamad and Abdulla. Prior to the visit, Abdulla had promised Daly to cease his opposition to the reforms. From this point on, Shaikhs Hamad and Abdulla referred to their father's era as \\"past misrule\\" and blamed it for current troubles facing them. A period after this, Daly reported that none of the promised reforms were carried out.; ; ; . During this period, sectarian terminologies and prejudices started appearing, and mistrust between Shias and Sunnis became the norm. Baharnah stopped paying taxes since February and Shaikh Hamad had been trying to reach a compromise. However, his uncle, Shaikh Khalid and his sons (known as Al Khawalid) were still insistent on collecting taxes from the Shia. In April, many Baharnah staged a protest at the British Agency. They only left after Shaikhs Hamad and Abdulla had promised that Shaikh Khalid's aggression would stop. The Shaikhs promised to introduce a new fair and nondiscriminatory taxing system. A new taxing system was submitted by Daly to the Shaikhs. They however were afraid that Sunnis would refuse to pay taxes and asked for the backing of British authorities. Daly wrote to higher authorities regarding the matter. Al Dawasir offered Shaikh Hamad their support against Baharnah. He turned them down to avoid losing Baharnah's support, especially at this time. =British hesitancy= On 2 May, the British Government replied to Daly's request. Its position however was changed with regard to reforms. Back in March they had requested \\"taking immediate measures for introducing reforms in Bahrain's financial and banking system\\" whereas by now they did not want any direct interference and only offered moral support.; . This development had diminished chances for more reforms that Daly wrote in May that \\"hope for reform have fizzled\\". In June, Shaikh Abdulla became a supporter of the reforms after reaching a financial reconciliation with his older brother. The apparent reluctance of British authorities have encouraged the opposing factions to resort to violence in order to end the calls for reform. Al Dawasir visited Ibn Saud in May and July 1922. They gained his support against the reforms. Back in 1913 Ibn Saud had annexed the nearby Al-Hasa to his newly formed theocratic state and may have wanted to use the current disturbances to annex Bahrain as well.; . He also opposed the reforms on the basis that they might influence the heavily taxed Shia majority in Al Hasa to demand similar rights. They had already tried to escape taxes by migrating to Bahrain, but the Political Agent prevented them in order not to give Ibn Saud an excuse for direct intervention in Bahrain. In light of these developments, Daly decided to wait and see what they come down to. Daly viewed Al Dawasir as the main obstacle to reforms. In July, Daly wrote that Baharnah themselves were divided; those who used peaceful means to support reforms were disappointed, others were stocking weapons and calling for outright revolution if the situation worsened. He wrote again in December that \\"[pressure for reforms may] have lapsed indefinitely\\". On 7 December, the Foreign Office decided to take action in light of the Persian media campaigns against their policy in Bahrain. Persian newspapers had accused Britain of overlooking the oppression of Shia in Bahrain. The Foreign Office was troubled by these articles as they \\"afford[ed] opportunity for anti-British agitations in Persia and elsewhere\\". It asked the Government of India to \\"express their earnest hope that steps might be taken forthwith for the introduction at Bahrain of reforms tending to ensure the equitable treatment of Shi'a\\". The message was forwarded to Trevor and Daly who agreed in January 1923 that the needed reforms revolved around taxation, courts and pearl diving. Trevor added that \\"material force\\" might be needed to enforce the reforms. During the same month, Ahmad bin Khamis, a Bahrani leader threatened Daly to publish their cause in the Indian media if reforms are not carried out. Shaikh Isa rejected a plan to supply Manama with water and electricity, despite attempts by several leading figures.; . In March, the Foreign Office asked the Government of India to introduce reforms. In face of these developments, the Government of India reluctantly agreed and told the Foreign Office in April: > We are anxious to use every endeavour to induce Shaikh Isa ostensibly on his > own initiative, it should be explained to Shaikh Isa that his subjects were > prevented from rising against him by our protection alone, and that we shall > back him up in carrying out reforms. Failing that even if it means his > enforced retirement and the deportation of Shaikh Abdulla we are determined > to carry out reforms ourselves. The Foreign Office gave its authorization and the Political Resident was to carryout the order \\"as the opportunity arose\\".; . In March 1923, Al Dawasir attacked Barbar, a Baharnah village. On 20 April, a fight occurred between Persians and Najdis in which several of them were injured. The small municipal police force was able to contain the situation quickly. Khayri mentioned that one Bastaki Persian had almost died due severe beating. Shaikh Isa's administration however did not punish the perpetrators from either side. During the same month, Lt Col Stuart George Knox became the acting Resident after Trevor went on leave. Knox was less enthusiastic about reforms and thought they were not in the interest of Britain. He stated that \\"misrule\\" had not increased in the past 20 years and that intervention would cause international repercussions. He also though that the Persian agitations were a smoke screen to revive their claim over Bahrain and thus it would not ease if reforms were implemented. The Viceroy of India was quick to point out to Knox that \\"misrule\\" in Bahrain would have been the only \\"serious flaw\\" in any future case of dispute with Persia over Bahrain in the League of Nations. He also noted that \\"publicity [was] a new factor that can't be ignored\\". Knox was ordered to act when 3-day-riots broke in Manama between Persians and Arabs of Najdi origin on 10 May.; . =Najdi-Persian riots= The specific sequence of events is disputed, but it is accepted that riots started after Abdulla al- Qusaibi (an agent of Ibn Saud and a pearl merchant) had accused a Persian shopkeeper of stealing a watch from his house. The matter was then taken to Mohammed Sharif who defused the situation by paying the cost of the watch. Few moments later, 2 Persians approached Sharif with injuries allegedly inflicted by Najdis. News reached the market and soon Persians and Najdis were clashing with each other. The clashes left 2 Persians and 1 Najdi dead in addition to a dozen of injuries, three critically.; . Khayri stated that those who started the riots were the same people involved in the earlier fight in April. He added that as soon as the fight erupted, Persians closed their shops and raised their arms in the face of Najdis. Najdis retaliated with stronger force and the riots continued to the afternoon. The situation subsided after Daly deployed guards from the British agency. He then held a meeting with Shaikh Hamad, al-Qusaibi and Sharif in which he held the latter two responsible for any further disturbances. Al-Qusaibi was accused of repeatedly inciting the Najdis to commit violence and in turn he accused Sharif of ordering municipality guards, who were mostly Persians to open fire on rioters. As a precaution, Daly requested that guards hand over their weapons. Although Daly did not dispute that the guards were prone to be biased towards their fellow Persians, he noted that there were no gunshot injuries among rioters. On the following day, the atmosphere was still tense with sporadic clashes. Armed Najdis were gathered at houses, including al-Qusaibi house, and rumors that Persians did the same were rife. Several armed groups of Najdis in Muharraq island and Al Dawasir in Budaiya tried to land in Manama. They were carrying Ibn Saud flag, chanting war songs and firing in air, but were deterred by the presence of machine gun‚Äìarmed British troops. On the third day, some armed Najdis remained in the streets, while Persians were instructed by Daly to stay at homes. Overall, 8 people were killed. Following the end of riots, Shaikh Hamad said al-Qusaibi was responsible for the violence and that he told Najdis about his plans several days before. Daly also held al-Qusaibi responsible, at best for exploiting the situation to instigate Najdis to riot and at worst for master-planning the riots.; ; . Al-Hassan mentioned that \\"most researchers\\" blamed riots on al-Qusaibi. Mohammed Al Tajir mentioned that the administration of Shaikh Isa \\"appeared\\" to be involved in instigating Najdis to riot, yet he also accused Sharif of instigating Persians to kill Najdis. As a witness to the events, Mohammed Al Tajir excused the government for not being able to control riots at first, because rioters were not Bahrainis and \\"it could not do much\\". Khayri who also witnessed the events blamed the riots on Shaikh Isa's administration which he accused of being biased in favor of Najdis. He also noted that Shaikh Isa was headquartered in Muharraq, where groups of armored Najdis had tried to lunch an attack on Manama. Ibn Saud accused Sharif of being behind the riots, accused the municipal guards of being biased against Najdis and criticized Britain as being one-sided.; . =Abdication of Shaikh Isa= On 12 May, the third day of riots in Manama, Ibn Saud advanced to Hofuf, near Bahrain. On the same day, Al Dawasir attacked A'ali village and Al Khawalid attacked Sitra, both Baharnah villages. The raids resulted in 12 people killed, dozens wounded and women raped. On 15 May, Knox arrived in Bahrain in two gunships. He deported al-Qusaibi and sacked Sharif. Shortly after this, Ibn Saud retreated to Riyadh. In the following days, Knox held meetings with Shaikhs Isa, Hamad and Abdulla to negotiate Shaikh Isa's voluntary abdication in favor of his elder son, Shaikh Hamad.; ; . Shaikh Isa objected on the basis that such move would humiliate him and lead to a confrontation with the tribes. Knox listed the shortcomings of the Shaikh and his mismanagement of internal affairs. He also reminded him of Abdul Rahman Al Saud who retired at old age and delegated his son, Ibn Saud to lead the tribe without feeling humiliated. Shaikh Isa, now aged 75, still refused, saying the situation was different. He requested that tribes must be consulted on the matter first. He added after further discussion that he would rather be decapitated or drowned than abdicate voluntarily. Knox refused to entertain any of his suggestions. As a last attempt to save his position, Shaikh Isa tried to enlist the support of Baharnah to a petition prepared by him, however they signed another petition calling for his forced abdication and listing a number of grievances.; . On 26 May, Knox held a major meeting with a couple hundred leading Bahraini figures from various backgrounds. Knox was in the middle, with Shaikh Hamad to his right, Daly to his left and Shaikh Abdulla to the left of Daly. In the meeting, which was described as \\"moving\\", Knox announced the abdication of Shaikh Isa. Shaikh Hamad agreed, stating: \\"In obedience to the orders of the High Government, today I assume on my shoulders the responsibility of the Government of this country\\". Shaikh Isa is reported to have \\"accepted the verdict reluctantly\\".; . Although Shaikh Isa was forcefully abdicated, he was allowed to keep the title of \\"Shaikh of Bahrain\\" and Shaikh Hamad -now the actual ruler- was known as the Deputy Ruler.; . Knox then gave a speech in which he affirmed the British support for administrative reforms, announced transforming custom revenues to Shaikh Hamad and told Al Dawasir that they may migrate to Saudi Arabia as they have frequently threatened, but that they should not \\"be surprised if [their] lands and houses are confiscated\\". He then addressed the Al Khalifa and the Shia. To the former he said they \\"must not expect that [they] have the right to live on the rest of community .. by preying on the poor and helpless\\". To the latter he said \\"[m]uch of the agitation of recent years has been fictitious\\" and that they \\"must not expect equality at a bound and Sunni privileges cannot be swept away at once, if at all\\". He also assured Sunnis that \\"reforms would lead to ultimate benefit of [their] community\\".; . Al Khawalid promised to reduce taxes on Sitra residents, but raised them again as soon as Knox left. =Further violence and trials= The petitions and political crisis continued to the reign of Shaikh Hamad. Opponents of the reforms demanded dismissing Daly and revocations of the reforms, especially those abolishing fidawis and the salifa court. They produced a large amount of \\"petitions, memorials, cables and articles in the press\\". Baharnah on the other hand continued supporting Shaikh Hamad, Daly and the reforms. A criminal court was set up to rule in the cases of violence. Al Dawasir and Al Khawalid reacted by intimidating the witnesses.; . In June, Al Dawasir attacked A'ali again, killing 3 people and severely injuring 4. They \\"looted most of the village\\". On 23 June, their tribe chief, Ahmad bin Abdullah was held responsible for the attack on A'ali. He had to serve few days in jail and compensate the victims. In revenge, a group of Al Dawasir attacked and killed two Baharnah notables near Budaiya on 10 July. The two had encouraged residents of A'ali to witness against Al Dawasir. Ahmad bin Abdullah was held responsible again, and this time fined Rs. 15,000. Following this, most of Al Dawasir decided to leave Bahrain to the mainland. The remaining were forced to leave by November, as their presence threatened the security of the island. As Knox and Trevor had previously warned, Al Dawasir properties were confiscated. They were prevented from diving in Bahrain pearl banks and their divers were freed from all debts.; ; . On 18 September, Al Khawalid attacked one village in Sitra and killed a man on the pretension that one of their camels was injured while grazing there. This case was more complicated as they were members of Al Khalifa family and direct cousins of the new ruler. Shaikh Hamad was in a deadlock; the law mandated him to punish Al Khawalid, while his tribal responsibilities held him to support his family in right and wrong. On 22 September, Shaikh Hamad -advised by Daly- held a court for Al Khawalid. The offenders were Shaikh Khalid, his sons Ali and Salman, and two of his servants. Shaikh Khalid was fined Rs. 2,000 and ordered to move his residence from Sitra to Riffa. Ali, who led the attack was banished for ten year. Salman was banished for one year and the two servants were imprisoned. Although the sentences were viewed as light by the Shia, they represented a victory for law and order as this was the first time a court finds members of the ruling family guilty.; . Al Khawalid however, were not happy with the result and held deep grudge against residents of Sitra who witnessed against them. On the night of 8 January 1924, they attacked Wadyan village in Sitra and the nearby Tubli village, killing several Baharnah men, women and children. Thousands of Baharnah reacted by staging protests for several days at the British Political Agency and sending petitions to Daly and Trevor. Shaikh Hamad was on a trip and his younger brother, Shaikh Mohammad acted on his behalf. Al Khawalid's guilt in the crime was established by witnesses accounts, but they left the country after refusing to appear before any court, except the Sharia court.; ; . Shaikh Hamad returned to Bahrain on 14 January and after discussing the matter with Daly ordered the arrest of the remaining suspects. Trevor was cabled by the Government of India who told him to ask Shaikh Hamad to punish the perpetrators, even if they belonged to his own family and that they will lend him support in doing so. Trevor arrived in Bahrain on 25 January, and a trial was set up for Al Khawalid the next day. The witnesses provided strong criminalizing evidence, which was described by Daly as \\"very conclusive and left no shadow of doubt as to the guilt of the accused\\". Shaikh Khalid was fined Rs. 2,000 and asked to leave Rifaa for Muharraq. His son Ibrahim, the leader of the attack was sentenced to death in absentia. Salman bin Khalid, who was already serving his banishment from the previous attack was also sentenced to death in absentia. Another perpetrator was sentenced to death in absentia and the remaining were given prison terms ranging from 6 months to 10 years.; . On 13 October 1926, four gunmen fired at Shaikh Hamad's car while he and his family were on their way to Budaiya. All of the shots missed the target. Despite offering a generous prize for information leading to the perpetrators, no one was arrested. Upon the emergence of new evidence in 1929, Ibrahim bin Khalid was arrested and found guilty. Shaikh Hamad however, did not take any action in the case, instead he appointed Ibrahim in his newly built Al-Sakhir Palace. Three of the hired gunmen were arrested in 1930; two were sentenced to life, while the third was killed while trying to escape jail.; ; . =Peaceful opposition= Other Al Khalifa did not resort to violence. Instead they wrote numerous letter and petitions to higher British authorities and to their friends abroad. In Muharraq and Manama, students at the school opened by Shaikh Abdulla posted anti-British leaflets on houses of those who supported reforms. Mohammad bin Abdulla (the son of Shaikh Abdulla) wrote to the Secretary of State for India. He also wrote two articles which appeared in the Syrian press. He was critical of the reforms and measures undertaken by the British such as arrest of Ahmad bin Abdullah Al-Dosari and forced abdication of Shaikh Isa. The latter also protested his forced abdication; Shaikh Isa sent several letters to British officials asking for an inquiry to investigate Bahrain's affairs. When Trevor returned from his leave on 21 October 1923, Shaikh Isa and Al Dawasir were optimistic and wrote a petition to him. Baharnah reacted by submitting a counter petition signed by 328 of them on 25 October. On 26 October, a group of 12 Sunni merchants and tribal leaders formed the \\"Bahrain National Congress\\" which called for six demands, among them were the restoration of Shaikh Isa as ruler unless he consented to the change, formation of a consultative council and that reforms should be compliant with Sharia and Urf.; . It is also stated that they have called for a legislative council. Congress members were described as \\"enlightened Sunni nationalist\\". Most of them were Nakhudas and merchants. According to Al-Rumaihi, the Congress leaders, Abdul Wahab al-Zayani and Ahmed bin Lahij tried to gather the support of a Bahrani leader, but they received a negative reply. Shaikh Isa supported demands of the Congress, which were sent to Trevor. Shaikh Hamad met with some of the Congress members, but failed to reach a compromise. During the same day of the Congress, a group of Baharnah notables led by Ahmad bin Khamis held a meeting. They submitted a petition of 9 points in which they renewed their support to the reforms, raised some demands and warned that they were ready to raise the issue with the British Parliament if their agitation was ignored. Trevor replied to the petitions by assuring Baharnah that reforms will continue and that their demands will be considered. He explained to Shaikh Isa that reforms were not the \\"personal wish of Knox or Daly\\", but orders of the British Government and that the \\"public scandal\\" of \\"tyranny and oppression\\" in Bahrain made them necessary. He noted that despite promising to do so, Shaikh Isa did not introduce any reforms. Trevor then made a public announcement that \\"the orders of His Majesty's Government will be executed in all circumstances and the [reforms] will continue steadily without the least hindrance.\\" On 1 November, Trevor arrived at Bahrain. He called for a meeting with the Bahrain National Congress at the British Political Agency on 7 November. On the face of it, the purpose of the meeting was to discuss demands of the Congress, however when its member arrived, al-Zayani and bin Lahij were detained and deported to India. The movement died with the arrest of its leaders as it lacked popular support. With the end of all forms of opposition, the road was paved for implementation of the administrative reforms.; . Al-Zayani continued his opposition to the reforms in India. Helped by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, he appealed to courts and to the Viceroy of India against his own deportation and Shaikh Isa's forced abdication. His efforts were largely fruitless and he died in 1925 at the age of 69. Shaikh Khalid died in 1925 as well.; . Several Arab newspapers in Syria, Egypt and Iraq were supportive of Shaikh Isa. Also, Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca and ruler of Qatar voiced their opposition to the reforms. =Implementation of reforms= One of the first reforms introduced by the new regime was the Civil List in June 1923. It allocated a monthly amount of Rs. 30,000 to the ruling family (this constituted 40% to 50% of state revenue). Shaikh Isa refused to receive his monthly salary of Rs. 4,000 initially, but in May 1926 he agreed to it.; . Members of the ruling family often complained that the allowances were not enough. In June 1923, the Government of India told Daly to avoid \\"interference too much and too directly\\" so that he does not become the actual ruler. In December, they questioned if British involvement had \\"gone too far\\" and in July 1924 it requested that reforms should not be carried further without the free consent of the ruler. Trevor assured them that Shaikh Hamad had fully agreed to the reform plan. Also, Daly pointed out that Bahrain will continue to progress with or without British intervention due to its people's travels and education.; . Daly, helped by his strong personal relationship with Shaikh Hamad and the pro-reform petitions continued to take a prominent part in the implementation of reforms on a daily basis, well beyond the legal frame of BOIC.; . Customs reforms The reorganized customs office of Manama In August 1923, the British appointed Mr. Bower to head the customs temporarily. He had previously served at the Imperial Indian Custom Service. He found obvious embezzlements and was able to recover Rs. 70,000. He also forced top merchants to pay on time, whereas previously they often delayed payments. The revenue of the customs, which was redirected to a government account in a British bank increased significantly that Bahrain's financial resources were described as \\"pleasingly solvent\\" by the end of 1923. On 14 January 1924, Bower was replaced with Claude de Grenier.; ; . Grenier was described by Trevor as a \\"qualified accountant\\" who had served in Baghdad and Bushehr. His work was praised by one British official who stated that \\"[Grenier] had increased State revenue by 20 per cent without raising customs duty; 97 per cent of the revenue accruing to the State was the result of his efforts\\". He remained in his position until 1929.; . Judicial reforms By the late 1920s, there were eight courts. They included those mentioned in the BOIC earlier, in addition to the Bahrain State Court (also known as Shaikh Hamad Court), opened in July 1923 for cases of Bahrainis against Bahrainis. It was based on the \\"Magna Carta\\" declaration of Shaikh Isa and introduced big improvements from previous practices in which \\"every member of Al-Khalifah family used to convict and punish Baharnah peasants without trial\\". Yet it suffered from major flaws as there was no codified law to refer to and prison conditions were miserable. Two Sharia courts were in operation, one for Sunnis and the other for Shia. Daly criticized the sectarian judicial system, calling it \\"the root grievance of Bahrainis\\".; . The judicial system suffered from other flaws as well; most of the judges were members of the ruling family and did not have law degrees nor were they legally qualified.; . Daly suggested that judges be elected by Bahrainis and put under British protection, and that Bahrainis be allowed to bring their cases to the Joint Court. The Political Resident supported this view, but the Government of India rejected it. Police reforms In June 1924, a power force of 150 Arabic-speaking Baluchis was recruited to serve as armed police. The force was requested by Shaikh Hamad in the end of 1923 and was approved by Trevor who thought that Arabs were \\"unsuitable\\" and Persians \\"objectionable to the Arabs\\". The Baluchis proved to be incompetent and undisciplined; in August 1926, one of them killed two of his colleagues and slightly injured Daly. Another unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate the head of police. Therefore, they were disbanded and replaced by retired Indian Army Punjabis in November.; . Pearl diving reforms Bahraini pearling license in 1942. In 1921 and 1922, during what Al-Hulaibi referred to as the Divers' Uprising, divers boycotted the tribal-biased salifa court and refused to pay debts to Nakhudas. The next year, salifa was suspended for investigation. It was found that some Nakhudas manipulated accounts to over- charge divers. The reforms began in 1924, when Nakhudas were required to keep a separate account book for each diver and a boat-licensing tax was introduced. The former change was aimed to protect divers' interests, while the latter provided large income to the state (~Rs. 50,000 in 1924). There were several other changes in favor of the divers such as preventing the Nakhudas from punishing divers on board the boat, preventing selling of pearls without the presence and consent of divers, and assigning a minimum wage for divers.; ; . Debts were no longer hereditary, but outstanding debts had to be paid. Initially, the Nakhudas opposed these reforms and instigated divers against them. In time however, they reluctantly agreed to them. Although the reforms were in their favor, divers were not happy with the reforms, because they limited the pre- and post-season loans, which they needed to supply their families. They protested annually during the beginning and end of the diving season. Merchants and pilots supported these protests.; . It was only after several years that the divers realized the reforms were in their benefit. Land reforms In 1924, Land Registration Office was opened to \\"register sales and transfer of property and to deal with cases of land disputes\\". In April 1925, a cadastral survey was conducted to register properties. There were two main goals, the first was to end the decades-long practice of \\"squeezing the indigenous Shiah population out of their [date-groves]\\" and the second was to tax all lands equally in order to support state budget. The Registration office was replaced by the Land Registry Department in March 1926, which shortly branched into a Survey Department. The \\"feudal estate\\" system was abolished. Land was divided to six categories: private land, government land, Shia endowment, Sunni endowment, progeny land and heirs land. About half of land was private properties, and Shia endowments far outnumbered their Sunni counterpart (33.6% to 0.7% of overall land, respectively). A Shia endowments department was formed in 1927, which transferred the control of these lands from the traditional authority of Shia jurists to the government. Ownership of private lands was given on the basis of occupation (10 years or more) and the historical ruler-issued \\"gift declarations\\" documents. Other lands were referred to the courts. Difficulties soon aroused within the ruling family over distribution of former estates, but a deal in 1932 was reached that included prohibiting forced labor and tax collection, and established of a \\"family court\\" to deal with intra-Al Khalifa disputes.; . Unregistered and unclaimed lands were registered to the state. The Al Khalifa ended up owning much of the agricultural lands in northern parts of Bahrain. Land renting was put under government supervision, with parties to it having to write out and submit to authorities the terms and conditions of contracts. With taxes and forced labor abolished, there was no need for wazirs and kikhdas and so these positions were abolished as well. A lighter state taxation system was introduced, it only contributed to a small percent of state budget, while the biggest part was through customs, especially those on pearl industry. The ruling family received much of the budget; in 1930 half of it was allocated to them either as allowances or salaries. Arrival of Belgrave and departure of Daly  Since 1923, Daly had been pressuring British authorities to approve a position for a judicial adviser. In 1925, he got approval from London. Shaikh Hamad is reported to have asked Daly to find a suitable British officer to work as a financial adviser for him. Daly advertised for the matter in British newspapers. Charles Belgrave was appointed to the post after an interview with Daly. Belgrave arrived at Bahrain in July where Daly received him and showed him over the country. Daly who had \\"substantially\\" ruled Bahrain left the country in September 1926, becoming Bahrain's longest-serving British Political Agent. Only few Bahrainis came to see him off. His position was filled by Major Barrett.; ; . Shaikh Hamad retracted some of the important decision he undertook when Daly was the Political Agent. Most notably were the cases of Al Dawasir and Al Khawalid. In 1927, about one year after Daly had left Bahrain, Shaikh Hamad said he was \\"disgrace[d]\\" by the confiscation of Al Dawasir properties, which was done under his name. He had agreed to pay them Rs. 200,000 to 300,000 in compensation, but was convinced by the Political Agent and members of his family to only pay them a third of that amount. In January 1927, Ibrahim bin Khalid contacted Shaikh Hamad, asking to be allowed to return to Bahrain. The plan was to reconcile between Al Khawalid and the residents of Sitra. The latter group would then drop the case and no retrial would be ordered. Belgrave protested against this move, calling it \\"disingenuous\\". Shaikh Hamad however stated that the initial trial was illegal and that he sentenced Al Khawalid to death against his own will in order to appease Daly. Barrett stated that the initial trial was fair and that evidence was strong (27 witnesses). He advised Shaikh Hamad to hold a retrial for them before the Sharia court. Shaikh Hamad however acted contrary to the Agent's advice; on 30 April 1928, 2 days after Ibrahim and his brother Salman had returned to Bahrain, he held a meeting that was attended by a Shia judge, the head of Sitra community (where the attacks occurred), Belgrave and children of the victims. The latter agreed to drop the charges after Shaikh Hamad had assured them that previous offenses would not be repeated. It was then proclaimed that Ibrahim and Salman were free to return to Bahrain. Also, they were given monthly allowances and their confiscated property was returned. The victims' families received blood-money and were compensated for properties stolen during the attack. The British Political Agent and Resident did not object. The latter expressed his hope that would help build trust between Al Khalifa and the Shia. Aftermath By the end of the 1920s, the administration in Bahrain was described as \\"reasonably efficient and modern\\". The British involvement however, was very deep. Belgrave was in control of all offices and British officials involvement was described in November 1927 by Denys Bray, the Secretary of the Foreign Department of the Government of India as \\"more than desirable\\". \\"A British Financial Adviser, British Police Superintendent and British Customs Manamager, this is more British than Katal, which is a Border state\\", he added. He also stated that the British position in Bahrain could only be adequately covered by a treaty that would extinguish \\"the Shaikh's sovereignty to a degree less than that possessed by an Indian chief.; . A more optimistic description of the situation was made in 1929 by C. G. Prior, then the British Political Agent. He stated that the British officials were indispensable and that they have made enormous improvements to the administration. He also said: > The Baharnah have had security and justice for the first time for 150 years > and have come to think of their rights. Divers' serfage has been much > ameliorated and there is little or no opposition to Government activities > and crimes of violence have almost ceased... Instead of resisting the > reforms the public spirit now demands them. The relationship between Baharnah and Al Khalifa was \\"improved dramatically\\". Baharnah co-operated with the administration and were optimistic about reforms. Despite these improved conditions of the Shia, Mahdi Al-Tajir stated that by 1929 some inequalities remained, especially with regards to \\"education, law and representation on various Government Councils\\". Schumacher gave an even darker evaluation of the situations. She stated that: > British reforms reaffirmed inequalities and reinforced the Sunni- > ruler/Shi'i-ruled equation by institutionalising Al Khalifa power. The Al > Khalifa no longer had to steal land because the methods devised for > determining land ownership guaranteed that most of it belonged to them. > \\"Fleecing the Baharna\\" could be done legally through the new judicial > system, whose judges were the Al Khalifa and the British president... The > institutions set up by the British and controlled by the Al khalifa did > little more than to redirect Baharna complaints\\". Although many in Al Khalifa initially opposed the reforms, they gradually accepted them and cooperated with the new authority. They ended up taking many of the newly created offices such as Minister of Education, head of police and judges.; . Shaikh Isa however, remained opposed to the reforms and continued to view himself as ruler of Bahrain. For instance, in April 1924 when Lt-Col F. B. Prideaux succeeded Trevor as British Political Resident, Shaikh Isa sent him a congratulatory telegram as ruler of Bahrain. Several influential members of Al Khalifa also continued to oppose the reforms and therefore remained under the surveillance Belgrave until his departure in 1957, after which they began to regain their former influence. Belgrave presided over many positions, that Shaikh Hamad was widely seen as \\"little more than a puppet\\". Legacy The call for reforms is seen as the first in a series of subsequent reform movements in the 1930s, 1950s, 1970s, 1990s and 2011.; . The reforms have empowered Baharnah to realize their political weight and express their demands vocally (as they did for instance in 1934), whereas in the past they did not take part in politics, despite their miserable conditions under the Al Khalifa.; . The reforms helped unite Shia and Sunni Bahrainis during the 1930s as the judiciary was then divided on the basis of nationality and both groups were thus categorized as \\"Bahraini\\". Even after many decades, the opposition to the reforms did not die out completely; during the reign of Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa (1961‚Äì99), the grand grand son of Shaikh Isa, some government publications refused to acknowledge 1923 as the end of Shaikh Isa's reign, instead they extended it to 1932, the year of his death. A history book published by University of Bahrain in 2009 and taught to its students also extended Shaikh Isa's reign to 1932. The book described his reign briefly, but made no mention of his forced abdication.; . Analysis Bahraini author Saeed al-Shehabi criticized the view of some Bahraini nationalists who opposed the reforms because of their opposition to the British. He argued that the oppression of Baharnah by Shaikh Isa's administration and the Sunni tribes required the abdication of Shaikh Isa. Al-Shehabi opposed appointing Shaikh Hamad as ruler, but viewed it as the lesser of two evils. He preferred if authority had been given to one of the people, but argued that the British would not have allowed this, because they required a weak ruler who needed them to keep the office. American political scientists Michael Herb had a similar analysis, describing Hamad as a \\"puppet\\" who was dependent on Britain due to lacking family support. Both Al-Shehabi and Saudi author Al-Hassan argued that the British intervention had sought to defuse any possible Baharnah revolution against Al Khalifa.; . This view is supported by a letter sent by the British Political Residency to Ibn Saud on 15 June 1923, in which it is stated that British intervention would lead in the long term to stabilizing the Al Khalifa regime and maintaining Sunni dominance over the island.; . Bahraini historian, Mohammed Al Tajir (d. 1967) mentioned that the only cause of British intervention was to put Bahrain under its control without having to wage a war. He explained that following the defeat of the Ottomans and Germans in World War I, the scene was clear for the British to overpower Bahrain. Al Tajir also accused Daly of seeking to divide and conquer by inciting Shia against Sunnis and vice versa. He cited a particular incident in which Daly told a group of Baharnah who came to seek protection to revenge from their oppressors and offered to give them weapons if they did not have any. Mai Al Khalifa, Bahrain's Minister of Culture argued that the British aim behind the reforms was to gain power and that they have deceived and used the Baharnah for this goal while privately warning Ibn Saud against their influence. Al Khalifa also wrote that members of Bahrain National Congress were motivated by their interests and traditional values. She cited their objection to the establishment of the airport, which undermined their traditional transportation trade as evidence. She also cited their opposition to the opening of cinemas for religious reasons. Al Khalifa was very critical of Daly, often describing him as the \\"de facto ruler\\" and accusing him of stirring sectarian tensions. She was also supportive of Shaikh Isa (her great- great-uncle) and described him as the legitimate ruler. She however, acknowledged the importance of modern institutions that were introduced by the reforms and laid the foundations of modern Bahrain. In a jointly authored book, Sawsan Al Sha'er and Mohammed Jassim argued that the goal of British intervention in Bahrain was to fill any gap that could afford a foothold to other foreign powers and to turn Bahrain into their main base in the Persian Gulf. Also, they stated that Political Agents, aided by the prestige of the British Empire had ambitions to rule Bahrain; they argued that Daly had exaggerated the intensity of the situation in Bahrain in order to convince higher British authorities to intervene in its local affairs. They also analyzed the causes of Shaikh Isa's opposition to British interventions; they stated that he resented and was embarrassed from being treated differently from other Arab rulers who enjoyed a higher degree of independence and that his son, Shaikh Abdulla had played a great role in alienating his father from the British. They stated that Baharnah leaders represented the pro-British party Bray had suggested and that were tools in the hands of the British who had successfully used sectarian differences to divide and rule. They concluded that whatever Baharnah motivations were, their actions were a great mistake that had deepened mistrust between them and Al Khalifa and that its consequences remain to this day. Mansoor al-Jamri rejected the aforementioned conclusion, calling the book \\"sick\\", \\"very poor, unrealistic, badmouthing, and raises hatred and sectarianism\\", because according to him, the book advocated the idea that Baharnah were agents for the British. He added that Baharnah were forced to seek British protection, because unlike other groups (e.g. Persians and Najdis) Baharnah were vulnerable to oppression by Shaikh Isa's regime as they had no one to protect them. The conclusion al-Jamri said one should reach is to read history carefully, understand it and try to live in peace with it. Nelida Fuccaro stated that the goal of reforms was \\"empowering large sections of the impoverished Arab Shi‚Äòi population and at keeping the political activities of Iran among the local Persian communities in check while creating a suitable framework for the continuation of the rule of the al-Khalifah family\\". Hamza wrote that oil exploration was the reason behind the reforms. Abdulhadi Khalaf referred to Britain actions against opponents of the reforms as \\"highhanded colonial measures\\". He also wrote that the reforms led to \\"unfinished dual processes of nation- and state building\\". Al-Rumaihi described the demands of Bahrain National Congress as \\"extremely progressive\\" and argued that they would have \\"sown the seeds of a more constitutional form of government\\" if accepted back then. He also described their demands as \\"moderate\\", because they were not insistent on the restoration of Shaikh Isa as ruler. He added that Baharnah did not cooperate with this movement due to the longstanding mistrust between the two communities and criticized British officers for favoring \\"reforms when imposed by themselves, but not when proposed by the indigenous Bahraini population\\". Mahdi Al-Tajir wrote that one of the important reasons behind Baharnah opposition to the Bahrain National Congress was its call for re-installment of Shaikh Isa, which Baharnah \\"had suffered greatly\\" during his reign. He added that \\"psychological and religious cleavages of the past\\" were a stumbling block to the unity between Baharnah and Sunnis. Bahraini cultural critic Nader Kadhim wrote that the main difference between the Sunni-led Bahrain National Congress and Baharnah was their priorities; while the latter were very firm in demanding equality, the former was very firm in demanding national sovereignty. He also wrote that al- Zayani favored the reforms, yet opposed them, because he considered them a British interference in Bahraini affairs. He added that if the two groups had joined forces, then this would have led to major political and social changes, and would have disintegrated the conformity of Shia and opposition in its infancy (it has become a norm to see Shia as anti-government and Sunnis as pro-government). Kadhim criticized the control of the tribal powers over the new administration, blaming them for the failure to reach a general consensus within the state, because their control went against the neutrality required for others to enjoy the benefits of the state without discrimination. Lebanese anthropologist Fuad Khuri mentioned that throughout the period of reforms, issues relating to government legitimacy, \\"public delegation, consent or any other form of representation\\" were not discussed, instead reforms were only focused on the administration. \\"In other words, the reforms laid down the foundations of 'modern' bureaucracy without establishing a 'modern' political system,\\" he added. Humaidan agreed with Khuri that reforms ignored democratic demands, adding that although the reforms were enforced by the British, they saved \\"the system from severe structural crises threatening its stability\\". He added that the Bahrain National Congress demands did not gather much support due to being associated with the violent faction that had opposed reforms. F. Gregory Gause argues that the reforms did not reduce the power base of Al Khalifa and its tribal allies, but forced them to change their methods while remaining dominant. Al-Jamri also stated that the reforms did not shift the status quo as the \\"[t]ribal elements made-up the core of the state\\". In his opinion, the reforms only succeeded in ending the \\"obvious parts of the feudal-tribal system\\", but failed in \\"amalgamating modern administration with tribal structure\\". Fred H. Lawson argued the reforms were no more than \\"modernization of autocracy\\". A study by S.K. Datta and J.B. Nugent argued that the pearl diving reforms were \\"counter-productive\\" and \\"contribut[ed] to the demise of the pearling industry\\". The basis of this conclusion is that removal of hereditary debts raised the cost of \\"recruitment of labour\\" and \\"granting of loans\\", and that giving equal loans to divers regardless of their skill reduced the competition between them. Mahdi Al-Tajir stated that the aforementioned analysis was exaggerated, despite containing some \\"measure of truth\\" in it. He added that the real causes behind the demise of pearling were not the regulations against abuse, but were the Great Depression of the 1930s, introduction of Japanese cultured pearls and the discovery of oil in Bahrain. Littlefield gave the same 3 reasons to explain the demise of the pearl industry. Hussain Esmail wrote that while Daly was one of the worst Political Agents in Bahrain's history, the reforms he introduced into pearl diving were one of his few good deeds.

For plain-dyed fabrics it is called a lab-dip, and for yarn-dyed fabrics (like stripes and checks), it is called a handloom. The use of swatches is an essential part of the design process as it enables designers to show the type of fabric to use, demonstrating how colours and different materials and trimmings will look in real terms before going to the trouble of making up a full design. Swatches also offer the advantage of illustrating how colours and patterns will appear on an actual fabric, something that may not be readily apparent from a paper or digital design. The textile manufacturer might bring together many swatches of their materials into a single sample book, enabling a salesperson to show a wide selection of available designs in various colorways to potential customers without the necessity of having multiple rolls of fabric immediately to hand.

He received his PhD in 1899 with a thesis: Materials for the knowledge of Croatian fauna of water polyps (Graƒëa za poznavanje hrvatske faune hidropolipa). He worked as a high school teacher in Osijek, Vara≈ædin, Susak and Zemun. In 1906 he was elected as a curator in the National Zoological Museum in Zagreb. At the same time he started working as a private docent, teaching morphology and systematics of invertebrates at the Faculty of Philosophy and the Higher Pedagogical School. He was appointed as a university professor of zoology in 1927, when he took over as the director of the Zoological Museum. He retired in 1945. Since 1940 he was a full member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. In his zoological research he mainly dealt with coelenterata, echinoderms and arthropods. He was especially interested in the sea fauna. He studied water polyps of the Adriatic Sea (Rad JAZU, 1898; Glasnik Hrvatskog naravoslovnog dru≈°tva, 1903; Zoologischer Anzeiger, Leipzig 1911, 1912, 1914; Glasnik Hrvatskog prirodoslovnog dru≈°tva, 1921), planktonic Coelenterata of scyphozoa and ctenophora (Rad JAZU, 1913), and also wrote several papers on sponges in the Adriatic, discovering several new species (Glasnik Hrvatskog prirodoslovnog dru≈°tva, 1921; Zoologische Jahrb√ºcher, Abt. f√ºr Systematik, √ñkologie und Geographie der Tiere, Jena 1923). He further studied isopod and decapod crustaceans and starfishes (Zoologischer Anzeiger, 1912, 1913; Glasnik Hrvatskog prirodoslovnog dru≈°tva, 1922), sea turtles (Priroda, 1920) and whale sharks (Zoologischer Anzeiger, 1939).

It applies to objects or systems that are chiral (not identical to their mirror image) and where, in addition, their mirror image has a symmetry group that differs from the symmetry group of the original object or system.Conway, John H.; Burgiel, Heidi; Goodman-Strauss, Chaim (2008). The Symmetries of Things, p. 353. A K Peters Ltd., London. . Many familiar chiral objects, like the capital letter 'Z' embedded in the plane, are not metachiral. The symmetry group of the capital letter 'Z' embedded in the plane consists of the identity transformation and a rotation over 180Àö (a half turn). In this case, the mirror image has the same symmetry group. In particular, asymmetric objects (that only have the identity transformation as symmetry, like a human hand) are not metachiral, since the mirror image is also asymmetric. In general, two-dimensional objects and bounded three-dimensional objects are not metachiral. An example of a metachiral object is an infinite helical staircase. A helix in 3D has a handedness (either left or right, like screw thread), whereby it differs from its mirror image. An infinite helical staircase, however, does have symmetries: screw operations, that is, a combination of a translation and a rotation. The symmetry group of the mirror image of an infinite helical staircase also contains screw operations. But they are of the opposite handedness and, hence, the symmetry groups differ. Note, however, that these symmetry groups are isomorphic. Of the 219 space groups, 11 are metachiral. A nice example of a metachiral spatial structure is the K4 crystal,Sunada, Toshikazu (Feb. 2008). \\"Crystals That Nature Might Miss Creating\\", Notices of the AMS, Volume 55, Number 2, pages 208-215. preprint also known as Triamond, and featured in the Bamboozle mathematical artwork.Bamboozle: A Mathematical Artwork in MetaForum See also * Chirality * Orientation (mathematics) * Stereochemistry * Right-hand rule * Handedness * Asymmetry References  * External links Category:Chirality ","title":"Metachirality"},{"id":"41528955","text":"The Christmas Burglars is a 1908 American silent short drama film directed by D.

He worked for numerous animation studios during his career, including Walt Disney Animation Studios, Warner Bros. Cartoons, Hanna-Barbera, and DePatie‚ÄìFreleng Enterprises, beginning his career during the late 1930s and continuing until the early 2000s. He was a frequent collaborator with director Chuck Jones, working with Jones both at Warner Bros. and Jones' own production company. Early life Born in Hanson, Kentucky on March 2, 1918, Givens was one of twin boys. His family moved to southern California, hoping the climate would improve the poor health of his father, who was a horse breeder and rancher. He attended Alhambra High School, graduating in 1936. He then worked as a freelance artist for the following year, before joining the Walt Disney Studio in 1937 on the recommendation of school classmate and Disney staffer Hardie Gramatky. Animation career After joining Disney, he worked as an animation checker on several of their short subjects (mostly involving Donald Duck), before working on their first feature-length film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). He subsequently joined Warner Bros. for his first stint at the studio, which was spent working mostly under Chuck Jones and Tex Avery. For the cartoon A Wild Hare (1940), Avery asked Givens to redesign a rabbit character previously designed by director Ben Hardaway and character designer Charles Thorson, which Avery thought had potential, but was \\"too cute\\" in his existing design. Givens, therefore, created the first official design for the rabbit, now named Bugs Bunny. Givens' design was subsequently refined by fellow animator Robert McKimson (under whom Givens would frequently work in the decades ahead) two years later. Givens' initial spell at the studio ended when he was drafted during World War II, his last cartoon for the studio before leaving happened to be The Draft Horse (1942). As part of his military service, he worked with former Warner Bros. animator Rudolf Ising on military training films. He subsequently returned to Warner Bros. in the 1950s and mostly worked as a layout artist under McKimson, and also Jones later on, staying with the studio until its 1954 shutdown. Unlike many of his co- workers, Givens did not rejoin the Warner Bros. studio when it eventually opened again, and worked at various other studios, including UPA, Hanna- Barbera and the Jack Kinney studio. He returned for one last spell at Warner Bros. in the early 1960s, continuing until the studio's final shutdown, and even acting as the layout artist on False Hare (1964), the final cartoon (in production order) made by the studio. Givens followed most of the Warner Bros. staffers to new studio DePatie‚ÄìFreleng Enterprises, while also working with Jones once more on the Tom and Jerry cartoons produced by Jones at Sib Tower 12 Productions. He continued his Looney Tunes association by working at the Warner Bros.-Seven Arts cartoon studio in the late 1960s, remaining with that studio until it shut down. Further spells at DePatie‚ÄìFreleng and Hanna-Barbera followed during the 1970s, before working at the reformed Warner Bros. Animation studio on Friz Freleng's Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie (1981), Bugs Bunny's 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales (1982) and Daffy Duck's Movie: Fantastic Island (1983). He then had spells at Filmation (whose founder, Lou Scheimer had actually worked under Givens when the two were freelancers in the 1950s) and Film Roman. Givens did the layout from Garfield and Friends from seasons 1 through 4 during the years 1988 to 1992 and Bobby's World from seasons 1 through 5 during the years 1989 to 1994 at Film Roman studios. In the 1990s, he worked with Chuck Jones once again, handling the production design duties on the Looney Tunes cartoons Jones' production company worked on for Warner Bros. His last animation credit was on 2001's Timber Wolf, a direct-to-video animated feature written and produced by Jones. After Jones died the following year, Givens largely retired from active animation work, though he continued to teach and give animation talks well into his 90s. Death Givens died of respiratory failure, on December 14, 2017, at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, at the age of 99.

From left to right: Howler, Bright Eyes, Cooler, Whopper, and Nose Marie. This is a list of Pound Puppies characters from the television series, that ran from 1986 to 1989, as well as the TV film, and Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw. The animated children's show was based on the popular 1980's stuffed toy line. Characters=Pound Puppies= Cooler (Beagle/Bloodhound mix) ‚Äì Cooler is the leader of the Pound Puppies. As his name would imply, Cooler has an outgoing and mellow personality and always keeps his head up even in the most daring situations. He also has a witty and sharp sense of humor compared to the other characters in the series, which is also backed up by his goofy Eddie Murphy-styled laugh. His battle cry is \\"Pound Puppies, let's start pounding!\\" In the season 2 episode Cooler, Come Back, Cooler was finally caught by Katrina Stoneheart. However, he escaped from Katrina's clutches in an unknown part of the United States and was taken to a dog pound with No-Name, a dog who refuses to be adopted. After saving every dog from the red leash, Cooler was about to be done for. Fortunately, No-Name (Now King) and his new master, Carolyn, saved him and Cooler is reunited with Holly and the Pound Puppies. Cooler and Holly have a special bond since the season 1 episode How to Found a Pound, when he helped Holly save the pound for the first time from Katrina Stoneheart. In Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw, he wore a white leather jacket (He had a blue leather jacket in the TV series) and his personality was a little more serious than in the TV series. In the TV special, he had a crush on Violet Vanderfeller and had a record of 762 escapes (which Cooler refers as \\"A nasty habit I'm trying to quit\\"). Voiced by Dan Gilvezan in both the TV series and the TV special. In Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw, Cooler was voiced by Brennan Howard and his singing voice was provided by Ashley Hall. Nose Marie (Boxer/Bloodhound mix) ‚Äì Nose Marie is the oldest female of the team. In the first series, she is flirtatious, has good manners, is a bit boastful at times, and is shown to have romantic interests in Cooler. In the second series, she is kind, mature, and has a motherly role over the younger Pound Puppies. When running scared, she often screams out \\"Eek! Eek! Eek I say! Eek!\\". In the season 2 episode Nose Marie Day, the other Pound Puppies decided to dedicate a holiday to her. However, Nose Marie felt like the \\"relaxing is becoming downright exhausting.\\" When she felt like she isn't wanted anymore, she ran away and was about to leave with Lisa, a little girl whose family is moving away. Just then, the Pound Puppies stopped Nose Marie because they wanted her to know that she was important to them and they wouldn't be the same without her. In the TV special, Nose Marie was referred as \\"The Nose\\" and has a record of 15 escapes. In Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw, she wore a pink dress and is somewhat like Cooler's girlfriend (As she was in Season 1 of the TV series). It is also revealed in the movie and in the TV special that she can track a scent with her nose (According to Nose Marie, her nose knows best.) Voiced by Ruth Buzzi in the TV series and in Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw. Nose Marie was originally voiced by Joanne Worley with a Brooklyn accent in the TV Special. Howler (Pug/Dalmatian mix) ‚Äì Howler is the inventor of the Pound Puppies squad. His inventions often solve the teams' problems. His trademark red derby comes with a mechanical hand that helps him invent or read a book when he has his hands full. As his name implies, he often howls after the end of his sentences or at the end of an episode. In season 1, Howler often stutters in his sentences, which is backed up by his howling. In season 2, Howler is generally not the spotlight puppy and has appeared in fewer episodes than he did in Season 1. In the season 1 episode In Pups We Trust, Howler was accused of stealing the Pound Puppies beloved items. He ran away from Holly's Puppy Pound and befriended a homeless dog named Spudge. While looking for food, they were almost kidnapped by Captain Slaughter. Fortunately, Howler's friends were able to save him and Spudge. Afterward, Howler was happy to be back with his friends. In Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw, Howler wore a green derby (red in the TV series), a red shirt with short sleeves (yellow in the TV series), and had brown curly hair (yellow in the TV series) and is not the bravest puppy of the group. Voiced by Robert Morse. He was originally voiced by Frank Welker in the Pound Puppies TV special and only howls. In Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw, Howler was voiced by Hal Rayle and his howling vocal effects were provided by Frank Welker. Bright Eyes (Yellow Labrador Retriever) ‚Äì Bright Eyes is the youngest female of the team, her name based on her bright blue eyes back in Season 1 and in the TV special. She is sweet, passionate, and extremely energetic. A hobby of hers is cheerleading, which is seen as one of her roles in the show. At times, she comes across as rather naive and ditzy, but is always aware of what's going on in a situation. In Season 2, Bright Eyes is younger than in season 1. In the season 1 episode Bright Eyes, Come Home, Bright Eyes wanted to be adopted. After an incident during the episode, Bright Eyes decides to stay with the Pound Puppies. Her dream of being adopted wasn't mentioned again in the series. In Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw, she wore a green shirt (blue in season 2, originally green in season 1), a yellow skirt (blue in the TV series), and has white fur (yellow in the TV series). Voiced by Nancy Cartwright impersonating Mae Questel in the TV series and in Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw. Bright Eyes was originally voiced by Adrienne Alexander in the Pound Puppies TV Special. Whopper (Jack Russell Terrier) ‚Äì Whopper is the youngest of the Pound Puppies. He is often fantasizing and imagining nearly impossible situations, and telling little white lies. He wears a diaper even though he is officially a \\"kid\\". Whopper also has a brother-sister relationship with Bright Eyes, as they often share opinions, come to agreements, and experience things together. He also dresses up in many different outfits as alter-egos during a heroic or otherwise serious situation, and provides comic relief. His most notable outfit and alter-ego is Wonder Whopper, in which Whopper wears a red cape and a blue bodysuit inspired by Superman. In the season 2 episode The Wonderful World of Whopper, he helped a puppy named Beezer snap out of her boredom with the power of his imagination. In season 2 he states that he wants to be a Golden Retriever when he grows up. Bright Eyes counters this by saying he is a \\"Mixed Breed.\\" In the present day storyline of Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw, he is an adult and shares the Bone of Scone story when he was a kid with his niece and nephew. Also, Whopper no longer wears a diaper and instead wears a blue shirt, blue pants, a blue cap, and is somewhat older than he was in the TV Series. Voiced by B.J. Ward in both the TV series and Pound Puppies and The Legend of Big Paw. Beamer (Scottish terrier/Schnauzer mix) ‚Äì Beamer is a happy-go-lucky puppy and behaves in a cheerful gentleman-like manner. Beamer likes to eat scones, crumpets, cookies and sandwiches. He is able to talk in other languages and accents besides his decidedly Scottish accent, like French, Spanish, and Welsh. His catchphrases are \\"Good tidings\\" and \\"Sometimes I did things that I'm not supposed to do, but I learn from them\\" and \\"It's awesome!\\" He will also say \\"Wow, that's really out of character\\" whenever he sees one of his friends behaving in a strange way and \\"Sweet Henrietta!\\" Beamer can also be fussy, clean and will not tolerate anything dirty. Sometimes, he has terrible classes. He is also part bull terrier. Beamer appeared in Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw. He is voiced by Greg Berg. Barkerville (English Bulldog) ‚Äì Barkerville or \\"Barky\\" by his friends is an upper-class, snobbish dog. Sometimes, he can be stubborn, smug and naughty, but is kind at heart. He behaves like a gentleman toward women, especially Violet. Barkerville appeared in the Pound Puppies TV special. He made a brief cameo appearance with Violet and Scrounger in Wagga Wagga at the beginning of Cooler's flashback. He is voiced by Alan Oppenheimer in the TV special and by Robert Morse in Wagga Wagga. Reflex (Schnoodle/Old English sheepdog mix) ‚Äì Reflex is a lovesick dog. His tactic is kissing all of his friends, which was followed by his catchphrase \\"I love you!\\" every time he hears a bell ring. His tactic can be used whenever needed, but most of the time, instead of doing it for mischief he uses it to make his friends happy whenever they feel sad. It also turned the other Pound Puppies back to normal when they were brainwashed by Marvin McNasty's Mean Machine. He's a mix with a purebred Bernese Mountain dog. Reflex appeared in Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw. He is voiced by Hal Rayle. Violet Vanderfeller (Greyhound/Shar Pei Mix) ‚Äì A dog from a rich family who was kidnapped by Flack and Tubbs as a ransom. However, Violet was able to escape from her kidnappers and landed in the City Pound. She has a crush on Cooler. At the end of the Pound Puppies TV special, she was happily reunited with her owners. Until the end of the TV special, Cooler referred Violet as \\"Sam\\". Along with Barkerville and Scrounger, Violet made a brief cameo appearance in the Season 1 episode Wagga Wagga at the beginning of Cooler's flashback. Her hobby is relaxing in a bath. She also has a hobby of teaching younger puppies about manners. Voiced by Gail Matthius. Louie (Cane Corso/Chinook Mix) ‚Äì A dog who served food to Violet and Cooler. Louie is an excellent cook. He speaks with a French accent. According to Cooler, Louie is not a good joke teller. He has an assistant who plays a violin. Louie appeared in the Pound Puppies TV special. Voiced by Don Messick. Scrounger (Beagle/Shar Pei Mix) ‚Äì In the Pound Puppies TV Special, he was a member of the Pound Puppies with yellow fur and loved garbage. He had a record of 29 escapes. His habit is finding junk, trinkets, or useless knick-knacks.

The world's first three peacetime train robberies were carried out by Frank and John Reno in Seymour, Indiana. The Reno Gang became so successful the Adams Express Company and railroad tycoons hired Allan Pinkerton to bring them to justice. Plot The Reno Brothers Gang were largely a group of criminals and war veterans that operated in the Midwest during and after the Civil War. They carried out the first peacetime train robbery in world history years before Jesse James and Billy the Kid gained notoriety. Ten members of the gang, including three brothers, were illegally lynched while in official protective custody of the US Government. Afterwards, a firestorm of international protests from Great Britain and Canada ensued. Ultimately, no one was ever identified or prosecuted for the murders. This new documentary examines the root cause of a small, rural Midwestern town in anarchy; not only due to the Reno Gang's crimes, but the secret formation of the Jackson County Vigilance Committee otherwise known as the Masked Halters or the Red Mask Society.

Johanne Andersdatter Sappi was the daughter of Anders Nielsen til Asdal and Ide Lydersdatter and the heir of one of the most powerful noble clans of Denmark. She first married the son of the chamberlain Bonde Due til Torp, who according to legend had her abducted. Widowed in 1430, she remarried Niels Eriksen til Vinstrup (d. 1447), by which she became the ancestral mother of the noble house Banner. She had four children during her first marriage, and fourteen during her second. By her wealth and her lands, as well as her personal qualities, she occupied a central place in the Danish nobility. The traditional legend that she was even given a place in the council of state, the riksr√•d, because of it is, however, not considered likely.

Following a meeting on May 29, 1992 convened at Cleveland, Ohio by Bishop Ellis, several congregations affiliated together as the United Pentecostal Churches of Christ.

It was discovered on 1 January 2014 by Richard Kowalski at the Mount Lemmon Survey at an apparent magnitude of 19 using a reflecting telescope at Mount Lemmon Observatory. 2014 AA was only observed over a short observation arc of about 70 minutes, and entered Earth's atmosphere about 21 hours after discovery. Nonetheless it remains one of only a few asteroids observed before impact (see Asteroid impact prediction). Entry impact location of near-Earth asteroid 2014 AA based on infrasound data from the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization. Using a poorly determined orbit, the JPL Small-Body Database listed a 3-sigma solution with impact occurring around 2 January 2014 02:33 UT ¬± 1 hour and 5 minutes. The Minor Planet Center listed impact as occurring around 2 January 2014 05:00 UT ¬± 10 hours. Independent calculations by Bill Gray, the Minor Planet Center and Steve Chesley at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory verified that impact was virtually certain. The impactor would have been roughly the size of , which exploded above the Nubian Desert in Sudan on 7 October 2008. Calculations by Chesley suggest the impactor fell somewhere on an arc extending from Central America to East Africa, with a best-fit location just off the coast of West Africa. Calculations by Pasquale Tricarico using the nominal orbit show that 2014 AA entered Earth's shadow cone approximately 40 minutes before entering the atmosphere. Infrasound was detected by three stations of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization. Peter Brown and Petrus Jenniskens located weak signals from infrasound stations in Bolivia, Brazil and Bermuda. 2014 AA entered Earth's atmosphere around 03:06 ¬± 5 min UT, 3,000 km from Caracas, Venezuela, far from any landmass. No ships or planes reported witnessing the event. A recalculation of the impact parameters of this meteor based on infrasound recordings puts it in the Atlantic Ocean about 1900 km (1030 nautical miles) east of Port of Spain in Trinidad, at a longitude of impact of nearly 44¬∫ West and a latitude of 11¬∫ North, the impact time being 2456659.618 JD UTC. Extensive numerical simulations indicate that, prior to impact, 2014 AA was subjected to a number of secular resonances and it may have followed a path similar to those of the NEOs , , , and ; NEOs in this transient group experience close encounters with the Earth-Moon system at perihelion and Mars at aphelion and could be a dynamical family.  Other discoveries  Kowalski previously discovered , the first asteroid discovered before Earth impact, using the same telescope in October 2008. There are about a billion near-Earth objects in the size range of 2014 AA, and impacts of comparably-sized objects occur several times each year. Several years later, 2018 LA was also discovered by the Mount Lemmon Survey, and ended up impacting Earth in southern Botswana in June 2018.

Players duel with swords in a pixelated environment. The game was commissioned for the New York University Game Center's annual multiplayer show, and was revised and demoed at private events over the next four years before its final release. It won Indiecade 2013's Game Design award and the 2011 Independent Games Festival's Nuovo award. It was released for Microsoft Windows on January 13, 2014, and later ported to OS X, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita. Critics praised the feel of the gameplay and its balance, but considered its single-player mode unsatisfying. Messhof released a sequel in 2017 with a higher resolution art style and additional weapons and arenas. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot Animated gameplay Nidhogg is a fast- paced two-player dueling game where two players sword fight in a side- scrolling environment. Players can run, jump, slide, throw their swords, and fistfight. The player-character's sword can be held at three different heights: low, medium, and high, and changing the sword's position to hit the opponent's sword will disarm the opponent. Players can also dive kick, wall jump, climb ledges, and crawl. The player continually pushes towards one side of the screen, such that they are permitted a few seconds to run towards their opponent's side while their opponent respawns after dying. The player to reach the end of their opponent's side first wins and is eaten by the mythological Norse serpent N√≠√∞h√∂ggr. Nidhogg has four different levels and single-player, local multiplayer, and online multiplayer two-player modes. The game also has a tournament mode and game variants including \\"boomerang swords\\". It can be played via a shared keyboard, and its art style has a pixelated aesthetic similar to games of the 1980s, with vivid colors and simple graphics. Development Inspired by the 1984 fighting game Great Swordsman, the game was made by indie developer Mark Essen over the course of four years, using GameMaker Studio. It was commissioned for the New York University Game Center's first No Quarter annual multiplayer show and first exhibited in April 2010 as Raging Hadron. The game was delayed as Messhof planned a formal release and later renamed Nidhogg, after the mythological Norse serpent who appears in-game. Messhof worked as the game's only programmer and his time was divided between development and his other freelance and personal projects, graduate school, and a job teaching at University of Southern California. The game languished until Kristina \\"Kristy\\" Norindr assisted Essen in founding Messhof LLC, a legally incorporated indie studio, joining as a co-founder and working in a business development role. She led the search for the game's musician. Their list of desired styles always included Daedelus, who they were able to contact through a mutual friend who attended high school with the musician. Daedelus designed some of the procedural elements that trigger the music sequences. Messhof described their process as wanting to \\"enhance the action\\" while letting players control the game's tension. He felt lucky to have Daedelus as his composer. Messhof also asked a former student to help him complete the game's netcode, which he deemed to be \\"totally essential\\" for the game's future as an eSport. He read about \\"programming and fighting game structure\\" over the course of development, which he credited as important towards the game's progress. It was his first attempt at networked multiplayer. Daedelus composed the game's soundtrack The core concept did not change over the course of development, though the other content did. Messhof limited the game's exposure during this time as he wanted the game to be respected in the fighting game genre and wanted to make sure it was ready first. Messhof himself, however, did not have much experience in this genre. He said that he \\"spent a lot of time\\" on the gameplay's feel and designed it to play slowly, where players wait for their opponent to move first, similar to Bushido Blade. He also spent time adding divekicks and cartwheels while improving the melee attacks and spectator experience. Some moves, such as a Yoshi-style \\"ground pound\\" and the Karate Kid crane kick, were attempted and removed. In testing, he would observe players and their strategies before attempting to write an artificial intelligence to use similar strategies. Messhof considers the single-player to be training for the online multiplayer, and the online multiplayer training for live matches. He described his process as making \\"the most fun game\\" to play with his friends. Gamasutra Mike Rose wrote that the game became \\"the equivalent of a video game fable\\" for its appearance at video game shows but lack of public release. It won several awards within a year of its first showing and appeared at \\"hyper-local indie group\\" meetups such as the Hand Eye Society of Toronto and Juegos Rancheros. A playable demo of the game was displayed at the 2013 Evolution Championship Series, with upgrades from previous demos of the game. The next year, the game was selected for the July 2014 Evolution Championship Series fighting game tournament's Indie Showcase. Messhof said that the game works best in live, public settings. Nidhogg was released on January 13, 2014, for Microsoft Windows via Steam. The release includes online competition and an eight-person tournament mode. A port for OS X was later released on May 19, 2014, and ports for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, developed by Code Mystics, on October 14, 2014. The Fencer later went on to appear as a playable character in the indie fighting game Divekick. Reception Nidhogg received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. It won Indiecade 2013's Game Design award and the 2011 Independent Games Festival's Nuovo Award, where it was also nominated for Excellence in Design and the Seumas McNally Grand Prize. It was IGN's January 2014 Game of the Month, and Rock, Paper, Shotgun awarded the game their first physical trophy. Reviewers praised the feel of the gameplay and its balance, and thought the single-player mode to be unsatisfying. Some critics found technical issues with the online multiplayer code, while others only had issues finding other players. Brandon Boyer marked the game as part of a \\"multiplayer renaissance\\" alongside TowerFall and Samurai Gunn. Polygon Russ Frushtick described the game as a tug-of-war closer to the National Football League than to Street Fighter. He commended the game's originality. Kyle Hilliard of Game Informer did not think the pixelated graphics were sufficiently \\"distinct\\" from similar games. He praised the soundtrack but wanted more tracks. Eurogamer Quintin Smith praised the game's balance, writing that \\"every single fight is hold-your-breath tense\\", that even the shortest fights \\"take on an air of majesty\\", and that kills feel fair. He described the game as multiplayer \\"theatre\\" for the impact the game has on those watching and playing it. Destructoid summarised the game as \\"Nidhogg stands as one of the true kings of competitive gameplay, and that doesn't need to be patched one bit\\", while GamesMaster said \\"A peculiar, thrilling and essential addition to your PC games collection. Best played with friends/enemies.\\" Rock, Paper, Shotgun Alec Meer described the game as a combination of \\"precision and reckless abandon\\". IGN's Keza MacDonald called it the \\"most exhilarating competitive game [she had] played in years\\". Edge put the game alongside Street Fighter II, Super Smash Bros., and GoldenEye 007 as games \\"written into history indelibly for their competitive multiplayer\\". The game later inspired indie games such as TowerFall and Samurai Gunn. Sean Hollister of The Verge described Nidhogg as \\"perfect\\". Regarding the overall proposition, GamesTM said \\"It‚Äôs a small package but there‚Äôs a wealth of value to be found in the creative gameplay that‚Äôll spur you through many hours of gaming\\", while PC Gamer said \\"A brilliant marriage of mechanics, level design and music that will be played and talked about for years to come\\", a sentiment echoed by VideoGamer, who said \\"Nidhogg is a game to be enjoyed with friends while in the same room together, and it may be the best title you play that way this year.\\"  Sequel  In August 2017, Messhof released a sequel, Nidhogg 2, for macOS, PlayStation 4, and Windows platforms. The sequel adds to its predecessor's core game mechanics and adds a colorful, higher resolution art style, additional weapons, and ten arenas.

Pietro Micca lights the gunpowder (1858, Museo del Risorgimento, Turin). Biography Gastaldi was born and died in Turin, Piedmont. He studied at the Accademia Albertina under Michele Cusa, Giovan Battista Biscarra, and Carlo Arienti. He then traveled to Florence and Rome during 1850‚Äì1851 and 1853‚Äì1859; and spent some time in Paris studying in the studio of the history painter Thomas Couture. He met also Paul Delaroche.Treccani Encyclopedia, short biography. In 1860 at the Promotrice of Turin, with the painting of Pietro Micca, he won the institute award funded by the Marchese Di Breme, and was nominated to be professor of painting at the Albertina. Among his other works depicting historical or literary subjects is The Prisoner of Chillon (1854, Promotrice at Turin). This work is based on a poem by Lord Byron and was made into an acquaforte engraving by Alberto Maso Gilli in 1864 in an Album of the Promotrice. Other works include: Gerolamo Savonarola in jail (1856); L'Innominato (1860); and Atala (1862). The latter is the half-Christian and half-Seminole maiden at the center of a Romantic style novel by the French author Chateaubriand, and which culminates in her chaste suicide. A number of other painters including Girodet, Luis Monroy, and Rodolfo Amoedo also depicted this subject. Gastaldi made two versions of the painting Sogno di Parisina (including the 1852 version at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and a second 1867 version in Turin). The tragic story of Parisina was popularized by writers including Matteo Bandello, Lope de Vega, and in 1816, Lord Byron. In the last version, the Duke of Ferrara ascertains his wife's infidelity, when she mentions her lover's name during sleep. The enraged Duke contracts the murder of the lover, who happens to be his bastard son; he has the assassins do so in front of the Duke's wife.Pittura e scultura in Piemonte 1842-1891: Catalogo cronografico illustrato della Esposizione Retrospettiva 1892., A.

It describes the gun control policies used in Germany from the 1918 Weimar Republic, through the Third Reich in 1938. The book aims to substantiate the Nazi gun control theory of gun politics in the United States by referencing German archives, diaries, and newspapers that attest to restrictions on firearm ownership for Jews and enemies of the state. It is published by the Independent Institute Halbrook is a lawyer involved in Second Amendment and gun control litigation on behalf of the National Rifle Association.Marjolijn Bijlefeld, People for and against gun control: a biographical reference, Greenwood Press, 1999, pp. 105-108, , 9780313306907 In an interview in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Halbrook said that he decided to research the topic because \\"Nobody has ever researched it. I first heard about it when I was an undergraduate in college in 1968, and there were these gun registration bills proposed in Congress. [...] The proponents of the bill challenged that and said they actually had commissioned a Library of Congress study saying there was no use of gun registration lists by the Nazis, either in Germany or in occupied countries, which was blatantly stupid. When (the Nazis) took power in 1933, they immediately used the (gun registration) records to disarm political enemies.\\" In a November 2013 review of the book in The New Republic, senior editor Alec MacGillis said Halbrook told him that he wanted the book to be seen as a scholarly work. As for analogies between Nazi gun laws and today's gun control debates, Halbrook said: \\"The Nazis thought it was really important to disarm political enemies and Jews, but as far as contemporary comparisons, I‚Äôm very aware of how loosely people use these comparisons, and it does a disservice to the victims of the Holocaust.\\" Critical reception A Washington Times review said, \\"It is the most extensive history to date of Nazi Germany's policies on firearms, drawing largely on original documents.\\" The New Republic wrote, \\"...the book's marketers, who are not shy at all about framing the Nazi's disarming of Jews and other political enemies as a giant, .950 caliber warning shot amid efforts in Washington and some states to pass new regulations on firearms.\\" and \\"[...] surely this book, now selling fairly briskly on Amazon, will have no impact whatsoever on the number of people making those loose comparisons [between contemporary gun control and the Nazis]\\". American Thinker wrote, \\"Would armed resistance on German soil have made a difference? No one can answer that with any certainty, but clearly it was a formidable concern for Werner Best and his Gestapo henchmen. Without arms there was no hope of meaningful resistance. [... the book] analyzes the manner in which the Nazis capitalized on the strict gun control policies of the Weimar Republic and used those policies to consolidate power and render the political opposition defenseless and the Jews hopeless.\\" See also * Gun legislation in Germany  References  Category:History books about the Holocaust Category:2013 non-fiction books Category:American non-fiction books ","title":"Gun Control in the Third Reich (book)"},{"id":"41529605","text":"Seticosta cigcligrapha is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

The game had more than one million downloads during the first fourteen days after its initial release. The game was released for iOS, Android and Windows Phone. As of October 2019, the app was unavailable on the App Store and the Play Store. Gameplay It is an infinitely running game. The player controls a pixel who is falling down and has to avoid dangerous black pixels represented by various shapes. As he avoids these pixels, his own pixel is getting bigger by collecting white pixels. Furthermore, by brushing the shapes (falling next to them), ideally in a quick succession, player scores and the mega pixel bar is getting filled up. When its filled completely, pixel becomes the Mega Pixel and demolishes everything in his way. Player can score by smashing shapes too, but that also reduces his size. There are also coins that player has to catch. He can use them to buy some power-ups like pistols. Power-ups can also be bought for real money.  Reception  The game received positive and mixed reviews. It was praised for its concept, graphics and its soundtrack.

Biography=Early career= Lanigan was born in Ogallala, Nebraska in 1943. While in high school, he was a DJ at his high school's radio station. Throughout the 1960s, Lanigan bounced between jobs in Denver, Colorado Springs (at one point working in both cities simultaneously - Colorado Springs during the day, and Denver at night), Albuquerque, NM, and Dallas. =Cleveland= 1974 print ad In 1971, Lanigan came to Cleveland to become the morning host at WGAR (1220 AM) as a replacement for Don Imus. With his outspoken style, Lanigan would quickly become a popular (and controversial) personality in Cleveland. John did his last show on WGAR February 9, 1984, after which he left Cleveland for a brief stint in Tampa, Florida. Lanigan would return to Cleveland in 1985, becoming host of The Lanigan and Webster Show on WMJI FM 105.7 with veteran Cleveland radio voice John Webster. Lanigan's popularity in Cleveland helped raise the profile of WMJI, leading to the station winning five National Association of Broadcasters Marconi Awards during his tenure (Large Market Station of the Year in 1998 and 2003, and Oldies Station of the Year in 2002, 2004, and 2006). Lanigan also is well known in Cleveland for his television work, as in conjunction with his radio shows, he was host of the daily afternoon Prize Movie on WUAB channel 43 during the '70s through the early '90s (with a hiatus when he was in Tampa, during which time the movie program was hosted by WWWE Radio morning man Fig Newton). During his show on July 20, 2012, as the news was breaking about the Aurora theater shooting, Lanigan reported that it was his son Jad, a Lieutenant in the Aurora, Colorado police department, who arrested the shooter James Holmes. In November 2013, Lanigan was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame at a ceremony in Chicago. Lanigan was honored on March 29, 2014 during the 2014 \\"Majic\\" Moondog Coronation Ball concert at Quicken Loans Arena. During the event, Lanigan was awarded with an official proclamation from the city of Cleveland, honoring his radio career and efforts in promoting the city. Lanigan's last show was on March 31, 2014, when he officially retired. In retirement, Lanigan stated that he plans to split his time between his homes in Colorado and Florida. In late 2014, Lanigan made somewhat of a comeback to Cleveland radio, becoming a co-host alongside Mike Trivisonno on The Spew, a daily hour-long debate program on WMJI sister station WTAM AM 1100. On August 8, 2018, Lanigan abruptly announced on air during a Spew broadcast that he was retiring from the show and radio entirely effective immediately, citing a lack of interest in the show's usual topics (politics, current events, Cleveland sports), not feeling qualified to give his opinions on such topics, and an overall lack of enjoyment doing the show.

It was located in Trocad√©ro in the 16th arrondissement of Paris and it had opened with 100 students. In the 1980s the school expanded rapidly. In 1990 it moved to a building that had been erected to serve as the Japanese school. Japanese companies had funded the new school building. That year, the school had 563 students in elementary school and junior high school. In 1991 it had 500 students, around the time of its peak enrollment and the time of peak investment from Japanese companies. Since then a Japanese recession occurred. In 2013 the school had 380 students. Operations and curriculum The school committee overseeing the school includes representatives of Japanese companies with offices in the Paris area. The tuition paid by parents is comparable to tuition at Japanese private schools. The school emphasizes the maintenance and cultivation of Japaneseness in its students while also promoting international understanding. As part of the latter, the school has its ninth grade students participate in class exchange visits with area French schools, and the Japanese school and the French schools partake in events in the School Festival compete in the Annual Sports Day. In addition, the Japanese school offers Saturday morning Japanese classes to the local community. =Curriculum= The Japanese Ministry of Education sets the curriculum, which is intended to provide a Japanese-style education and allow students to re-enter Japanese schools. The ministry also sends teachers to teach at the Japanese school. The school has no Saturday morning programme so seven classes per day are offered instead of six. The local authority requires the school to offer French classes for two to three hours per week, so the school uses French and Japanese French-language teachers. Transport The school runs eight daily buses throughout the Paris area to pick up and drop off students.Conte-Helm, p. 85.

Overview  Alarm was filmed primarily in Dublin, Ireland. The lead actors are Aidan Turner (known for his role as K√≠li in the film series The Hobbit) and Ruth Bradley (known for playing Garda Lisa Nolan in Grabbers).  Premise  After witnessing the murder of her father by burglars, Molly is living with friends and seeing a psychiatrist (Emmet Bergin) to deal with her panic attacks. She dreams of finding a house where she can live alone. Upon buying her dream house in a Dublin suburb, she gives a house-warming party and one of her friends brings along an old classmate of Molly's, Mal. Molly had fancied Mal during school, and now they become a couple. With a new house and a new boyfriend, things seem perfect. However, soon her house is burglarized again and again, although her neighbours are spared. Molly suspects that someone she knows might be involved.  Cast  * Ruth Bradley as Molly * Aidan Turner as Mal * Owen Roe as Joe and Mossie * Tom Hickey as Frank * Anita Reeves as Jessie * Emmet Bergin as Psychiatrist * Alan Howley as Peter * Fionnuala Murphy as Receptionist * Alan Martin Walsh  Release  Alarm was shown at the Irish cinema in 2008. On November 30, 2010, an American DVD was published by the IFC Film studios.  Critical reception  When director and writer Gerard Stembridge introduced Alarm to the audience he said that he had wanted to do a \\"swan song for the Celtic tiger\\" (i.e. Ireland's economic boom in the 1990s). Furthermore, he had wanted to create a good old-fashioned thriller. However, critics doubt that he succeeded with this, noting that the plot is predictable. Many scenes were filmed at night and the action during these scenes is hard to see.

He is researcher for the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies (ISTC) of the Italian National Research Council (CNR) in Rome. He is Professor Emeritus in Psychoanalysis at the International Institute of Depth Psychology in Kiev. He founded and edited the European Journal of Psychoanalysis (since 2012 also published in Russian). Biography He studied at the University of Paris 7 between 1967 and 1973, where he obtained a Ma√Ætrise (master's degree) in Psychology. In the same period he followed seminars by Roland Barthes (at the √âcole Pratique des Hautes Etudes) and Jacques Lacan. He obtained his second degree in Sociology (in 1976) at the University of Urbino (Italy) and trained in psychoanalysis with analysts Elvio Fachinelli and Diego Napolitani in Milan, where he lived and worked between 1974 and 1979. He was Visiting Researcher at the Philosophy Department of the New School for Social Research (1989-1991). Since moving from Milan to Rome he has divided his work activities between research in Social Psychology with CNR, his private practice as analyst and his writing, both as author of papers and as journalist publishing in newspapers and magazines. In 1984, he co-founded the cultural magazine Lettre Internationale (which comes out with editions in German, Italian, Spanish and several other languages). He also contributes to American Imago and to various international magazines (such as the French L‚ÄôEvolution psychiatrique and Cliniques M√©diterran√©ennes, the German Texte, the Russian Psykoanalyz). In 1995 he founded in New York the semestral Journal of European Psychoanalysis, later EJPsy - European Journal of Psychoanalysis, which he edited until 2012 (www.journal-psychoanalysis.eu). Since 2011 he teaches Psychoanalysis at Kiev‚Äôs Institute of Depth Psychology. Thought Benvenuto has addressed fields apparently very different from one another ‚Äì social psychology, philosophy of language, political philosophy, psychoanalysis, political theory ‚Äì in the nineties he began to structure a predominant project that touches upon all these fields: to replace the primacy of reflection on Truth (typical of Western culture) with a reflection that aims at the Real. In this way he seeks a third way between the two predominant and opposing Western cultures: positivist epistemology (concerned with the truth conditions of propositions) on the one hand, and hermeneutics (concerned with disclosing a Truth that unravels throughout human history) on the other. He adopts the concept of Real from Jacques Lacan, but broadens its meaning, including in it everything that remains external (origin and remainder) to every structure of sense, whether scientific, aesthetic, ethical and political. The Real is the background upon which every scientific theory, every artistic production, the psychoanalysis of each subject, every ethic arrangement, revolves and it is always in excess of all these ‚Äúdiscourses‚Äù. Thus, the Real of every scientific theory is the Chaos that sets itself as the limit and background of every causative process. The Real in psychoanalysis is the background to the drives, the bodily, irreducibly individual background before which all interpretation stops. In particular (for example in La strategia freudiana [The Freudian Strategy] and in Perversionen [Perversions]) he has engaged in an original reinterpretation of Freudian theory and of psychoanalysis in general, as founded on a precise metaphysics of ‚Äúthe signifying flesh‚Äù. Freud‚Äôs interpretative and explicative tissue, however, also refers to something uninterpretable and inexplicable: the drive as an opaque non-signifying source of subjectivity.

This former fishing village lies west of the city centre of Karlsruhe, not far from the river Rhine on the river Alb and comprises about 12,000 inhabitants.  History  Daxlanden was first mentioned in 1261 as \\"villa daslar\\" in a papal document. However, the place is certainly older, as indicated by existence of the Wei√üenburg Monastery and Gottesaue Monastery. In 1396, the Appen Mill in Daxlanden was first mentioned upon its donation to the hospital in Baden (today Baden-Baden). The Appen Mill remained property of the hospital until into the 18th century and was the official mill of the surrounding boroughs Bulach, Beiertheim, Daxlanden, M√ºhlburg and Knielingen. In 1407, Archbishop to Cologne Friedrich III. von Saarwerden settled a dispute over hunting rights in the \\"Daheslarerau\\" and surrounding areas between Rupert, King of Germany, and Bernard I, Margrave of Baden-Baden in favour of the former. In 1463, Daxlanden established its own parish, previously it belonged to the parish of Forchheim. With the division of the Margraviate of Baden, Daxlanden was designated to Baden-Baden and belonged therewith to the Ettlingen Council. The boom years Gold panning in the gold fields in Daxlanden were in 1579. From the 18th century on they have been fruitless. On the 6th of March 1651 the worst catastrophe in the history of Daxlanden occurred. A break in the dam on the Rhein destroyed 700 acres of fields, 20 houses and the local church. As a consequence of this, half of Daxlanden was at risk of dropping into the Rhein. Following many such flooding catastrophes afflicting the borough, a new Daxlanden was established on a high bank further from the Rhein. In 1665, the Appen Mill that had been destroyed in the Thirty Years War was rebuilt. 1673/77 saw new dams for the Rhein being constructed around Daxlanden and Rappenw√∂rth. It had been attempted many times to restrain the Rhein through dam building.

At the beginning of the 15th century, it was decided to combat the city's lagging population by accommodating crossbowmen and their families there, especially as they could also man the surrounding defences. The quarter has three main streets which run parallel to each other: Postera, Enmedio and San Basilio. Unlike the winding streets elsewhere in the city centre, they are perfectly straight, introducing a more rational approach to urban planning. By contrast, the generally two-storey, whitewashed houses have an Arabic look, arranged as they are around central courtyards or patios forming a neighbourhood known as \\"Los Patios Cordobeses\\". From the late 14th century, the area was occupied by Jewish converts who created a ghetto. An attempt to banish them failed, thanks to mediation by the Catholic monarchs in 1479. However, as a result of poor sanitation, they were later moved to nearby San Nicolas de la Villa. One of the most interesting structures in San Basilio is the Torre de Bel√©n, a fine example of a former defensive gate providing access to a walled enclosure. The parish Church of San Basilio, on the site of a monastery founded in 1590, is built in the 17th-century Baroque style with period furnishings. The 18th-century convent \\"Cofrad√≠a de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Paz\\" houses the richly decorated altarpiece from the former \\"Convento de Santa Clara\\".

It was released on September 12, 2013 for iOS, and on October 15 for Android. Initially available in the App Store and Google Play for purchase, the game switched to a freemium model in February 2014, with the inclusion of in-app purchases. On February 20, 2014, the game was greenlit for Steam. An early access version was released for Windows and OS X on April 15, with the game going gold on December 17. The game has received mixed to positive reviews, and has been downloaded over three million times. A sequel, Dead Effect 2 was released on October 29, 2015.  Gameplay  Gameplay in Dead Effect. The player aims at an approaching zombie. The virtual joystick is on the bottom left, the fire, reload and ironsights buttons on the bottom right. Weapon selection is on the top right. The gameplay mechanics of Dead Effect are similar to other first person iOS/Android shooters, such as the games of the Modern Combat or N.O.V.A. series. In the default setup, movement is controlled by a virtual joystick on the left of the screen, with sight and aim controlled by the player moving their finger across the touchscreen, although there are two shortcut buttons on the left and right of the screen to allow the player to instantly turn 90 degrees to the left or right. Players can use explosives, iron sights, reload, change weapons, shoot and enter slow motion mode using virtual buttons on the right of the screen. Controls can be customized from the main menu, with each icon individually repositionable as the player sees fits. In story mode, the player can play as either a male (Gunnar Davis) or a female (Jane Grey), although there is no difference in storyline or weaponry. The game features twelve missions, which the player must complete in sequence, fighting enemies in the form of zombies and completing tasks such as finding codes to open doors. On various levels, the player also encounters bosses. Each level features pods which replenish the player's health, and in later levels, pods can be found which will upgrade the player's stats. Every level also contains secret orbs, which can be shot, and hidden tablets, which can be collected. In survival mode, the player must survive for a set amount of time, killing as many enemies as possible. In biohazard mode, the player must defeat waves of enemies. Scores and achievements are tracked through Game Center.  Story  Set in 2045, the game begins with Jane Grey awakening from cryostasis 178 days into the flight of the colonization spaceship ESS Meridian. A member of the elite security team, \\"Unit 13\\", Grey is unsure why the computer has awoken her early, and so sets out to learn what is happening. She discovers that the crew of the ship have turned into zombies; detecting unusual activity on board, the computer automatically awakened Unit 13 as per its security protocol. When Grey is able to reactive the comlink on her suit, the computer tells her that there is something wrong with her, but before she can investigate further, she is contacted by Dr. Wagner of the research division. Wagner tells her that the crew have been attacked by a virus that kills and then reanimates them, and that she too is infected, which is why her suit reported health anomalies. Wagner directs her to the med-lab and a computerized medi-bed administers a detox serum. Wagner tells Grey that the virus is man-made, developed as part of the \\"Dead Effect\\" project, but was accidentally leaked and infected the entire crew. He explains that in the absence of the pilot, the ship activated its autopilot, which is programmed to return to Earth. If the Meridian reaches Earth, the virus will infect the whole of mankind. The only way to stop the ship is to manually shut down the propulsion unit. Grey does so, and Wagner directs her to his own location, saying they will decide what to do next together. When Grey arrives in the lab, Dr. Wagner reveals that she herself is actually part of the \\"Dead Effect\\" experiment; they are not on a spaceship at all, they are on a massive orbital research centre, and there was no accidental zombie outbreak - the entire exercise was part of Wagner's research into developing mutagens to increase combat stamina (collectible log files clarify that Dr. Wagner is delusional, and that the ESS Meridian really was a colony ship; Dr. Wagner deliberately mutated the crew and converted the ship into a combat testing ground for his experiments). He tells Grey that she has performed very well, and her results will be archived for future study. He tries to kill her using a medi-bed, but Grey escapes and vows to hunt him down and kill him. She escapes from the lab and goes in search of Dr. Wagner, who has used a virus on himself, turning him into a zombie-like creature with electrical powers. She finds him in the core of the station, and kills him. Reception Dead Effect has received mixed to positive reviews. The iOS version holds an aggregate score of 70 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on ten reviews, and 70.62% on GameRankings, based on eight reviews. TouchArcade's James Paterson was impressed, scoring the game 4 out of 5. Although he was critical of the lack of originality in the plot, the poor voice acting, the absence of a run ability and no online multiplayer mode, he concluded that \\"at its core, Dead Effect is yet another fun shooter featuring everyone's favorite reanimated beings. You won't find anything new, but it offers a decent challenge, and has some great replayability in survival mode and trying to earn all the achievements. If you're a fan of violent, bloody, horror themed games, you'll find a good distraction in this one.\\" Modojo's Chris Buffa also scored the game 4 out of 5. He found the voice acting to be so bad, that it helped the game, by introducing unintended comic elements into an otherwise serious story. He concluded that \\"Dead Effect entertains despite following the same route we've seen in countless zombie games. Bottom line, it's a good start to what should become an even greater experience in the months ahead. Zombies in space? Sure, why not?\\" Pocket Gamer's Harry Slater scored the game 7 out of 10, writing \\"There may not be much in the way of subtlety in Dead Effect, and it might not rank among the most innovative games on the App Store, but there's a lot of gory, mindless fun here. And sometimes that's all you really want from a game. A big silly shooter with lots of zombies to plough through, Dead Effect is far from a classic. But it is brainless fun.\\" 148Apps' Blake Grundman scored the game 3.5 out of 5, writing \\"It isn't anything overly special, but it is a passable first person shooter on a platform already littered with far less fruitful attempts. Those looking to indulge their inner B movie lover need look no further.\\" MacLifes Chris Pereira was less impressed, scoring the game 2 out of 5, and writing \\"The weapons, setting, music, and enemies are all uninspired, and the gunplay is too weak to compensate. As a result, Dead Effect is a thoroughly run-of-the- mill first-person shooter.\\" He was critical of the controls, the similarity of the levels, the enemy AI, the dialogue and the voice acting. Although he praised the sound effects, he concluded that \\"for every positive element there's something to gripe about on the other end, whether it's the dull upgrade system or unremarkable shooting. Dead Effect is an uninspired first- person shooter that does nothing original, proving most memorable for its hilariously awful dialogue.\\"  Notes  References  External links  * Category:2013 video games Category:First-person shooters Category:Zombie video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:IOS games Category:Video games developed in the Czech Republic Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Steam Greenlight games Category:Video games featuring protagonists of selectable gender Category:MacOS games Category:Windows games Category:Single-player video games Category:Early access video games ","title":"Dead Effect"},{"id":"41530031","text":"Rami M.

AL.COM, Kay Campbell on May 24, 2013  Early life and education  Shapiro was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, and raised in a modern Orthodox Jewish household. Introduced to the study of world religion in high school he began a serious study of and practice in Zen Buddhism at age sixteen. Shapiro entered the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1969, majoring in philosophy. There he met Teresina Havens, a retired professor of world religion from Smith College who took him on as a private student studying both the Bhagavad Gita and Goddess-based spirituality. His work with Havens culminated in a private conference exploring the archetypal Divine Feminine in Hinduism and Judaism. As part of a year abroad program, Shapiro attended the University of Tel Aviv, where he focused on Jewish philosophy, especially the work of Martin Buber. While in Israel he studied Chabad Hasidism, and lived for a short time at Kfar Chabad, a Chabad Lubavitch Hasidic community. He then enrolled full-time at Smith College (one of only eight men allowed to do so at the time), where he majored in Buddhist Studies with Professor Taitetsu Unno. Shapiro managed Smith's zendo and sat sesshin with Joshu Sasaki Roshi of Mount Baldy Zen Center. His philosophy degree was conferred by the University of Massachusetts in 1973. Upon graduation Shapiro married Deborah Flanigan and the two moved to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada where he earned his M.A. in Religious Studies at McMaster University with a concentration in contemporary Jewish philosophy, especially the work of Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan. Shapiro entered the Hebrew Union College‚ÄìJewish Institute of Religion in 1976, and spent his first year of study in Jerusalem, where he studied privately with Rabbi Kaplan, who was then 99 years old, and with Rabbi Sherwin Wine and the Society for Humanistic Judaism. After his year in Jerusalem, Shapiro continued his studies under the tutelage of Ellis Rivkin, Eugene Mihaly, Alvin Reines, and Rabbi Sherwin Wine, seeking to blend his love of Judaism with his passion for Zen Buddhism, Taoism, and Advaita Vedanta (non-dual Hinduism). In 1979 he was appointed as a chaplain in the United States Air Force, where he served as the full-time rabbi at Wright‚ÄìPatterson AFB. Shapiro completed his rabbinic studies in 1981.\\"Every religion has its shadow side: Rabbi Rami Shapiro\\". Poulomi Banerjee, Hindustan Times, New Delhi  Dec 06, 2015  Career and work  Upon graduation, Shapiro moved to Miami, Florida, and created Temple Beth Or, a synagogue and think tank where he experimented with new forms of Jewish liturgy and practice, combining his experiences with Judaism, Buddhism, and Hinduism.\\"Book Review: Jesus through Jewish Eyes\\". Jews for Jesus, by Matt Sieger He continued his Zen practice with the aid of Gesshin Roshi's International Zen Institute of Miami. In 1985 Shapiro completed a Ph.D. in Contemporary Jewish Studies from Union Graduate School using his work with the temple as the basis for his dissertation. During his 20 years at Temple Beth Or, Shapiro studied with Rabbi Zalman Shachter-Shalomi, the founder of Jewish Renewal, a neo-Hasidic movement. In 2000 Shachter-Shalomi gave him the title of Rebbe (spiritual master). In 1984 Shapiro was invited to become a founding member of the Snowmass Group, an annual gathering of contemplatives from various religions held at St. Benedict's Monastery in Snowmass, Colorado, under the auspices of Father Thomas Keating. Through Keating, Shapiro met Ed Bastian, the founder of the Spiritual Paths Institute, and became part of the institute's faculty. Also on the institute's faculty was Swami Atmarupananda, who became Shapiro's primary Hindu teacher. After a decade of study, Shapiro was initiated into the Ramakrishna Order of Vedanta Hinduism under Atmarupananda's teacher, Swami Swahananda. Shapiro lectures on the parallels between Judaism and Hinduism at various Vedanta centers in India and the United States. In 2002 Shapiro was invited to deliver the Huston Smith Lecture at the California Institute of Integral Studies. He called this lecture, delivered with Smith sitting in the front row, \\"one of the highlights of my career.\\" In 2012 Shapiro teamed up with Reverend Tim Miner and the Order of Universal Interfaith to co-found the annual Big I Conference on Inclusive Theology, Spirituality, and Consciousness. In 2016, after leaving the university, Shapiro teamed up with Reverend Claire Goodman and Frank Levy to create the One River Foundation.oneriverfoundation.org\\"A Rabbi Seeking Wisdom Across Religious Lines\\". Tablet, Wayne Robins One River promotes the study of Perennial Wisdom, the mystic heart found at the core of all religions.

Batei Saidoff (, \\"Saidoff Houses\\") is a former courtyard neighborhood in western Jerusalem. Erected by Yitzhak Saidoff, a wealthy Bukharan Jew, in 1911, it was one of a series of courtyard neighborhoods built along Jaffa Road in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, together with Sha'arei Yerushalayim and Ohel Shlomo.Kroyanker and Wahrman (1983), pp. 199-200. In the 2000s the two buildings facing Jaffa Road were evacuated of tenants and redeveloped as upscale shops, and a 23-story luxury residential tower was constructed south of the courtyard. Location Batei Saidoff is located on the southern side of Jaffa Road, east of Sha'arei Zedek Street and west of Eliyahu Mani Street. It is east of the original Sha'arei Zedek Hospital (now the Israel Broadcasting Authority) and west of Mahane Yehuda Market. It was built opposite the Ohel Shlomo neighborhood and to the east of the Sha'arei Yerushalayim neighborhood, both located on the northern side of Jaffa Road.Ben-Arieh (1979), p. 275. History One group that made a mark on early Jerusalem home construction was Bukharan Jews, mostly affluent merchants who built upscale homes and public institutions. At the same time as the Bukharim quarter was under construction, Bukharan Jews erected several fine buildings along Jaffa Road. These include the Mashiach Borochoff House, the Kandinoff House, the Sephardic Orphanage, and Batei Saidoff.Kroyanker and Wahrman (2003), p. 287. Batei Saidoff was built by Yitzhak Saidoff, a wealthy Bukharan Jew, in 1911.Kroyanker and Wahrman (1983), p. 200. Batei Saidoff was designed as an \\"open courtyard\\" with two long, two-story buildings attached at an angle on the southern side of Jaffa Road and two smaller, two-story buildings at the eastern and western sides of the courtyard. The homes opened onto the courtyard,Wager (1988), p. 222. with a balcony accessing the upper story.\\"◊™◊ê◊ï◊û◊ô◊ù ◊ë◊ô◊®◊ï◊©◊ú◊ô◊ù\\" [Twins in Jerusalem], in ◊°◊§◊®◊ï◊™ ◊ô◊ú◊ì◊ô◊ù ◊ï◊†◊ï◊¢◊® [Stories of Children and Youth], Gershon Bergson, ed., issue 100. Retrieved 8 December 2013. A small synagogue was on the upper story. Shops occupied the lower story of the buildings, with their entrances facing Jaffa Road. In the courtyard stood two cisterns and a shared bathroom tower. The development was considered luxurious for its era. By the 1950s the residents of Batei Saidoff were primarily poor Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish families. The buildings deteriorated as family dwellings were replaced by workshops and warehouses. The facade underwent a facelift by the Jerusalem municipality in 1983. Redevelopment In 1999 a renewal plan promoted by a group of homeowners called for the construction of a seven-story residential tower on the site of Batei Saidoff. In following years, the plan changed to that of a 23-story luxury residential tower consisting of 90 penthouses and duplexes, ranging from three to six rooms each, to be erected south of the courtyard. The complex will include a swimming pool, indoor gym, spa, and synagogue; there will also be a concierge service and a 24-hour surveillance system. The high- rise proposal aroused opposition from conservation groups, who contested it in the Israeli Supreme Court, but the project received building rights in 2008. The last tenants were evacuated and the original two-story buildings abutting Jaffa Road were restored and prepared for occupancy by upscale shops and art galleries, (subscription) while the other buildings in the complex were razed. The Saidoff Tower joins four other luxury high-rises planned for Jaffa Road, with the goal of revitalizing the city center.

He became proprietor in 1860 of the substantial Egmont Hotel in Kanturk through renting it from the estate of the Earl of Egmont. Johnson played a prominent role from 1869 in the Amnesty Association established by Isaac Butt, campaigning for the release of Fenian prisoners. The association organised its first open-air rallies in Mallow and Skibbereen where Johnson displayed his fierce gift of oratory. He also addressed further pro-Fenian meetings, which included a commemoration at Kilclooney Wood, the site of the death of Peter O‚ÄôNeill Crawley. He contributed letters to the weekly pro-Fenian The Irishman, as well as to the Cork Examiner, publicly advocating a republican form of government, but his exact relationship to the Irish Republican Brotherhood are unclear, often denying he was a sworn Fenian member. Political engagement When Isaac Butt founded the Home Government Association in 1870, Johnson was active in its formation and campaigned for it in several elections always opposing the Gladstonian candidates. In October 1872 he, together with Butt and John Nolan, leader of the Amnesty Association, went on a speaking tour of Britain. Johnson first turned to the concerns of labourers in 1869 when he co-founded in September the Kanturk Labourers‚Äô Club, becoming its secretary in January 1870. It was the first body of its kind in the country which attempted to represent agricultural labourers. The club had several hundred members and attracted thousands to its rallies. It recruited its supporters largely from Fenian sympathisers. Focused on calling for improvements to Gladstone‚Äôs first Irish Land Act 1870, the club demanded that its legislation needed to incorporate provisions for housing and small holdings to be made available to labourers at a ‚Äòfair rent‚Äô. On the other hand the club discouraged conflict with tenant farmers over wage rates. Johnson attempted to organise clubs elsewhere in the country, with only limited success. This largely due to the labourers‚Äô situation, although extremely discontent, they were widely dispersed and had irregular seasonal work patterns. Their dwindling numbers due to emigration and their limited vision made them difficult to organise. As a result labourers‚Äô organisations tended to be organised by agrarian activists and radicals such as Johnson, who were themselves not labourers. Labourers‚Äô union Together with Butt‚Äôs Home Government Association, Johnson operated the club from 1871 as affiliated to it, but his more genuine commitment to the labourers‚Äô cause and his belief that British radicals were natural allies of Irish republicans had him establish contact to the newly evolving National Agricultural Labourers Union (NALU) in Britain. A few of their activists came to Ireland to support him. At a meeting at Johnson‚Äôs hotel in August 1873 attended by Butt and P. J. Smyth and some NALU representatives, the Irish Agricultural Labourers Union (IALU) was founded. Despite some initial successes in Munster and Leinster, the home rule MPs though nominally its leaders, showed little interest in its activities so that by 1875 the IALU had faded away. Other reasons for this were that the IALU activities aroused conservative and clerical suspicion due to its nationalism and Fenian connection and the rhetoric of some of its speakers. This in turn led to a breakdown of relations with the NALU. Johnson began to suffer health problems after an accident and turned to advocating emigration to Canada, setting up an emigration business in his hotel. Labour league activist During the Land War of the early 1880s Johnson was symbolically nominated to the founding executive of the Land League and was a leading activist in north Cork and the surrounding counties. When from December 1880 landlords attempted to encourage divisions between farmers and labourers, Johnson reactivated labourers‚Äô organisations as a countermeasure to these attempts. He then took a leading role in establishing a Munster Labour League at a conference in Limerick in May 1881. The league functioned as a pressure group within the Land League movement and campaigned for more attention to be given to the demands of labourers as well as betterment for small tenant farmers. It also acted as an umbrella, uniting the many local ‚Äòlabourer leagues‚Äô which had sprung up spontaneously as a reaction to the agricultural crisis. Many supporters advocated that he be returned to parliament, but it never came about, though the police regarded him as a candidate for arrest, which also didn‚Äôt happen. From mid 1882 Johnson recognised that the national directory was neglecting the labourers‚Äô needs and reducing their organisations to being mere subservient off-shoots of the Irish National League. He justifiably scaled back his political involvement and was never again prominent on a national level. Later years Johnson bought his hotel and six acres of adjoining land in the 1890s and stayed in business in Kanturk until 1917. He remained an outspoken anti-Parnellite, though in the years prior to the first world war he nevertheless supported the local Redmonite faction against the All-for-Ireland League founded by his fellow townsman William O'Brien which was backed by the Kanturk founder of a newer labourers‚Äô association, D. D. Sheehan. It can be said of Johnson that he took a formative role in the creation of a form of ‚Äòlabour-nationalism‚Äô centred in Munster committed to the well-being of the landless labourers, although he was primarily a believer in a cross class nationalist alliance rather than a trade unionist in the latter day sense of the word. His engagement played a notable, if sub-ordinate, part in nationalist politics throughout the home rule movement and had also some influence on the post-independence Labour Party. After selling his hotel in 1917 he retired to live with his grandchildren in Clifden, County Galway, where he died 3 November 1926. NotesReferences *Lane, Fintan: \\"P.F.

It is administered by the West Zimbabwe Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. History Since its establishment the school has a history of academic excellence and producing outstanding members of the society, producing the best academic results in Tsholotsho District. The school enrolled its first ‚ÄúA‚Äù level (form 5) students in 2004. It is one of the best ‚ÄúA‚Äù level schools in the province, a standard which has been maintained until today. Year after year Nemane Adventist High School remains one of the best school in the province. Location The school is located 23 km southwest of Tsholotsho township along Mgodimasili Road. Education system Students entering Form I, usually aged 12‚Äì13, compete for places at the school based on their Grade 7 examination results, as well as school-based interviews and placement tests. The school consists of three levels: ZJC (Zimbabwe Junior Certificate) which includes Forms I and II; \\"O\\" level which includes Forms III and IV; and \\"A\\" level which includes Forms V and VI. The ZJC Core Curriculum consists of 8 subjects: English, Ndebele, Mathematics, Science, History, Geography, Bible Knowledge, and a Practical Subject (i.e. Fashion and Fabrics, Woodwork, Agriculture, Metalwork, etc.) Zimbabwe phased out the ZJC examinations in 2001, but has maintained the same curricular framework for general Form 1 and 2 education and plan to renew this set of examinations at the end of Form 2 education. Based on their Form 1 and 2 reports, students are assigned to courses and tracked classes for their \\"O\\" level studies for Forms III and IV. The school also offers Hexco National Foundation courses in the Following Areas: Motor Maintenance, Brick and Block laying, Cabinet making, Computer operations and Packages, Computer Programming, Computer systems installation Servicing and repairs, Horticulture, Business English, Book Keeping, Office Practice, Garment Construction. Ordinary level Since the early 1990s and until April 2002, GCE \\"O\\" level examinations were set and marked in Zimbabwe by the Zimbabwe Examinations Council (ZIMSEC) in conjunction with the University of Cambridge International Examination GCE system. Marks from highest to lowest are A, B, C, D, E, U with A, B, and C as passing marks. Subjects being offered for \\"O\\" level examinations include: * Sciences: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Physics with Chemistry, Integrated Science, Mathematics * Arts: English Literature, Religious Education, Geography, History, Sociology * Commercial Subjects: Accounts, Business Studies, Economics, Computer Studies * Languages: English, Ndebele * Practical Subjects: Woodwork, Agriculture, Fashion & Fabrics. To receive a passing ZIMSEC \\"O\\" level GCE certificate, a student needs to have passed at least five subjects including English language with a mark of \\"C\\" or better. The English and mathematics \\"O\\" level examinations serve as gatekeepers for many students who cannot proceed without them despite their other exam scores. Entrance into \\"A\\" level programs is quite competitive, with the majority of \\"O\\" level students either returning to small-scale farming, entering the work force or proceeding to a vocational course, a technical school or a nursing or teaching college. Only students with the best scores manage to find a high school place in an \\"A\\" level program. Advanced \\"A\\" level At the Advanced \\"A\\" level, students choose among science, commercial and art subjects to study for Forms V and VI. The vast majority of students take three subjects at \\"A\\" level, with a few very gifted students at elite schools opting for four subjects. In addition, many A level students take \\"English for Communication‚Äù, which before 2004 was called ‚ÄúGeneral Paper, \\" a very challenging exam that assesses both English writing skills and knowledge of current events both nationally and worldwide. English for Communication is marked on a 1‚Äì9 scale with 1 as the highest mark and a 1‚Äì6 as a pass. Through 2001, \\"A\\" level examinations written in Zimbabwe continued to be set and marked at the University of Cambridge in the UK; they have been considerably more challenging than \\"O\\" levels, yielding far less favourable pass rates. Starting June 2002 exams, A levels were localised and run by ZIMSEC. It is common for a capable student to have higher \\"O\\" level exam marks than her/his \\"A\\" level exam marks. \\"A\\" level subjects being offered include: * Arts: English Literature, Geography, Ndebele/Zulu Language and Literature, Divinity, History, Sociology * Commercial: Business Studies, Economics, Accounting, Computing * Sciences: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Agriculture Category:Schools in Zimbabwe Category:Education in Matabeleland North Province Category:Educational institutions with year of establishment missing ","title":"Nemane Adventist High School"},{"id":"41530270","title":"Golf at the 1986 Asian Games"},{"id":"41530273","title":"2000 Anguillian general election"},{"id":"41530298","text":"Bibi Medoua (born Bibi Balbine Laure Medoua on 9 August 1993) is a Cameroonian football defender.

His medical training took place in Dublin and Edinburgh. He then went into practice in Kilkenny for some years, moving to London about 1829. Ryan was a member of the Royal College of Physicians in London, where he practised, and was physician to the Metropolitan Free Hospital. He took on a number of lecturing posts. He died in London on 11 December 1840, leaving a young family. Works Ryan published in 1831 part of a course of lectures on medical jurisprudence, delivered at the medical theatre, Hatton Garden, under the title Lectures on Population, Marriage, and Divorce as Questions of State Medicine, comprising an Account of the Causes and Treatment of Impotence and Sterility. In the same year appeared the completed form of his Manual of Medical Jurisprudence, being an Analysis of a Course of Lectures on Forensic Medicine. A second and enlarged edition was issued in 1836, an edition with notes by R. E. Griffith, M.D., having been published in Philadelphia in 1832. In 1831 also appeared the third edition, of Ryan's Manual of Midwifery ‚Ä¶ comprising a new Nomenclature of Obstetric Medicine, with a concise Account of the Symptoms and Treatment of the most important Diseases of Women and Children. An enlarged edition was issued in 1841, rewritten, and containing 120 figures. The Atlas of Obstetricity had been issued separately in 1840. An American edition of the Manual appeared at Burlington, Vermont, in 1835. In editing from 1832 to 1838 the original London Medical and Surgical Journal, Ryan had some assistance from James Fernandez Clarke. His later publications included The Philosophy of Marriage in its Social, Moral, and Physical Relations; with an Account of the Diseases of the Genito-Urinary Organs and the Physiology of Generation in the Vegetable and Animal Kingdom, 1837; this formed part of a course of obstetric lectures delivered at the North London School of Medicine. Twelve editions in all, the last in 1867, were issued. This work contained an attack on extreme proponents of birth control. It was followed in 1839 by Prostitution in London, with a Comparative View of that of Paris and New York ‚Ä¶ with an Account of the Nature and Treatment of the various Diseases.

The IFLB was parallel to the International Football Association Board (IFAB), formed by the football associations (FAs) of each of the four Home Nations (with the English FA and Welsh FA both on the IFAB). Subsequently, the IFAB was extended to include FIFA, whereas the IFLB did not extend its geographical remit, although the League of Ireland joined after splitting from the Irish League.

Early years Henri Fran√ßois Lambert was born in Haraucourt, Meurthe-et-Moselle, on 3 June 1760 to a humble family. His parents were Antoine Lambert and Magdelaine Mangin, both in the service of the count of Chatenay. The count and his wife were his godparents. He was well educated by the standards of the time. On 5 August 1780, aged twenty, he volunteered for the regiment of Artois-Infanterie, and rose slowly through the ranks. He was named corporal on 2 December 1784 and quartermaster on 1 November 1785. The next year he married the daughter of the regiment's bandleader. He was given leave on 15 October 1788 and returned to his family, who were living in Dijon. Revolutionary soldier When the French Revolution (1789‚Äì1799) broke out, Lambert supported it enthusiastically. On 18 May 1790 he was appointed adjutant in the national guard of Burgundy, and in 1792 he was named second in command. On 5 September 1792 he was elected lieutenant colonel and second in command of the battalion of grenadiers of the C√¥te-d'Or. He was attached to the Army of the North, which he joined soon after the Battle of Jemappes in November, and with whom he served in the Belgian campaign. His battalion was then assigned to the Army of the Alps, which freed Lyon from the royalists. On 28 January 1794 he was promoted to brigadier general of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle. He played a distinguished role in the first wars of the revolution. He served with distinction in several battles, notably in the recovery of Kaiserslautern in the Palatinate on 29 September 1794. In June 1795, he was given command of a brigade of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle under General Jean-Charles Pichegru. The French army crossed the Rhine and took a position on the right bank, near Mannheim, but was forced to recross the river by Austrian troops. Lambert fought valiantly during the retreat, and was mentioned in an order of the day on 25 November 1785. After the replacement of Pichegru by General Jean Victor Marie Moreau, in June 1796 the Army of the Rhine and Moselle recrossed the Rhine at Strasbourg and defeated the Austrians at Renchen and at Rastadt. Lambert again distinguished himself as the army advanced into Bavaria. Death Rottenegg Lambert was conducting a reconnaissance at Menstadt, a small town near Nuremberg, when he was mortally wounded by the explosion of a bomb. He was taken back to Mauern, a village in Neustadt an der Donau, behind the lines. Lambert died on 7 September 1796. Before dying he asked that the fragment of shrapnel that had wounded him be preserved in the church, where it remains today. He was buried beside the Mountain Church of Rottenegg, about to the southwest. During his lifetime Lambert had chosen this as his final resting place if he should die in the region.

W. Griffith. The Internet Movie Database lists Mary Pickford as appearing in this short. However, Pickford did not begin with Biograph until the end of April 1909. Synopsis Dear little Mrs. Jones once gave a tea party to her temperance friends, at which Mr. Jones unfortunately got intoxicated. So his presence was objected to when the ladies met again. As luck would have it the waiter who was to serve the repast could not come, and so Jones, poor fellow, consented to disguise himself and act as waiter to his own wife's guests. These prim and virtuous ladies duly arrived; the meal was served and all proceeded happily until Jones, who received the dishes from a pert maid in the kitchen, was seized by a desire to try an experiment before the meal was finished. Discovering a bottle which appeared to contain a spirituous liquid, he poured some into each of the guests' cups. The effect of the experiment was soon apparent. The ladies got more communicative towards each; they warmed and melted: they clamored for more \\"tea\\"; they got quite boisterous and just slightly indecorous, and finally so abusive and intoxicated that Mrs. Jones had to clear them off, and then husband and wife were reconciled, presumably with a promise on his part to behave himself in future.The moving picture world January 9, 1909 page 34 Cast * John R.

Synopsis  Whenever she shares her daily routine farmwork with her father, the young narrator is taken to be a boy by visitors. She tries to keep away from any work in her mother's range of tasks because she does not really take any interest in that kind of work. The narrator remembers that by the time she was eleven years old she was faced with more and more expectations of what a girl should be like and what she should do or not do. Her role in the family began to change, and the narrator concludes with telling the story of an event in which she behaved according to her intuition, is squealed on by her younger brother and subsequently is being assigned the new gender role by her father. The narrator's last comment reads: ‚Ä≥Maybe it was true.‚Ä≥  Architecture of the story  The architecture of Munro's short stories is essential for any interpretation.‚Ä≥She revolutionized the architecture of short stories, often beginning a story in an unexpected place then moving backward or forward in time, and brought a modesty and subtle wit to her work that admirers often traced to her background growing up in rural Canada‚Ä≥, writes Julie Bosmans, Alice Munro Wins Nobel Prize in Literature, The New York Times, 10 October 2013 This story consists of three sections, with the first being the shortest and the last the longest.

Summary Hacking discusses the history of probability.. Here is a quote from page 17 of the book, which describes the basic model the author uses to try to understand probability: It is better to expose the crudities of one‚Äôs model at the start, than to conceal a methodology in banal phrases. I am inviting the reader to imagine, first of all, that there is a space of possible theories about probability that has been rather constant from 1660 to the present. Secondly, this space resulted from a transformation upon some quite different conceptual structure. Thirdly, some characteristics of that prior structure, themselves quite forgotten, have impressed themselves on our present scheme of thought. Fourth: perhaps an understanding of our space and its preconditions can liberate us from the cycle of probability theories that has trapped us for so long. This last feature has a familiar ring. The picture is, formally, the same as the one used by the psychoanalysts and by the English philosophers of language. ‚ÄòEvents preserved in memory only below the level of consciousness‚Äô, ‚Äòrules of language that lie deep below the surface‚Äô, and ‚Äòa conceptual space determined by forgotten preconditions‚Äô: all three have, of course, a common ancestor in Hegel. I do not ask any reader to swallow all this. The story told in what follows is of interest even if the methodology that led to it turns out to be silly. I state the picture partly to explain how some of the data have been selected. The author argues that there was a sudden and dramatic transition in the conception of probability in the mid seventeenth century, which led to modern concepts of probability. He also explains that he is making use of Foucault's archaeology of knowledge to study the historical development and change in the ideas of probability. Publication history The Emergence of Probability was first published by Cambridge University Press in 1975. A second edition was published in 2006. Reception The Emergence of Probability has been described as ground- breaking. The philosopher James Franklin argued that Hacking's contention that there was no concept of uncertain evidence before about 1650 is incorrect, as it neglects the extensive Latin scholastic literature on legal evidence and aleatory contracts and on induction.

First published by Cambridge University Press, it is a sequel to Hacking's The Emergence of Probability (1975). The book received positive reviews. Summary Hacking discusses the history of probability. He draws on the work of the philosopher Michel Foucault. Publication history The Taming of Chance was first published in the United Kingdom by Cambridge University Press in 1990. It is part of the series Ideas in Context. Reception The Taming of Chance has been described as ground-breaking. The book received positive reviews from the statistician Dennis Lindley in Nature, the philosopher Stephen P. Turner in the American Journal of Sociology, the historian of science Theodore M. Porter in American Scientist and in Poetics Today, and Timothy L. Alborn in Isis. The book received mixed reviews from the philosopher Margaret Schabas in Science and Bruce Kuklick in American Historical Review. Lindley credited Hacking with presenting a careful and entertaining discussion of the development of the idea of chance, successfully showing that the laws of chance developed from \\"collections of data.\\" He noted that, \\"Hacking's argument is supported by a vast number of references to statistical work and the interpretations put upon it.\\" However, he criticized Hacking's style for being sometimes \\"overwhelming in its complexity\\", and questioned whether Hacking's thesis was original. Turner wrote that the book was useful for both sociologists of science and historians of social science, and that while Hacking's arguments were open to objections, Hacking was \\"too sophisticated\\" to be caught by them. Porter wrote in American Scientist that Hacking made \\"outstanding use\\" of Foucault's insights. He believed that Hacking's perspective was \\"especially fitting as an approach to the history of probability and statistics.\\" Although he was not entirely satisfied with Hacking's arguments, he concluded that the book was \\"eminently worth reading.\\" In Poetics Today, Porter described the book as \\"exceptionally illuminating on the issue of statistics and control\\" and credited Hacking with suggesting a \\"suitably subtle way of understanding social statistics.\\" Alborn wrote that Hacking had a \\"vibrant writing style\\" and presented a \\"wealth of material\\". However, he also wrote that the book left many questions unanswered. Schabas complimented Hacking for his discussion of \\"the debate over free will and determinism.\\" However, she wrote that because the book built on previous works by Hacking such as The Emergence of Probability, it \\"does not exhilarate quite as much.\\" She disputed the novelty of parts of Hacking's argument, noting that Porter had dealt with much of the same subject matter in The Rise of Statistical Thinking (1986). Kuklick noted that the book was a sequel to Hacking's earlier work The Emergence of Probability. Kuklick praised Hacking for the \\"richness of his ideas\\" and credited him with mastering complicated literature in several languages and \\"meticulous scholarship\\" superior to that of Foucault. However, he considered the book a \\"strain to understand\\" and criticized Hacking for giving insufficient emphasis to the role of the hospital in \\"acclimating the public to chance and probability\\", and for his \\"penchant for irrelevant anecdotes\\" and poor judgment about how to write about the past.

The only way to comprehend Big data is to reduce the data into small, visually-appealing objects representing various aspects of large data sets (such as histogram, charts, and scatter plots). Big Data is all about finding correlations, but Small Data is all about finding the causation, the reason why. A formal definition of small data has been proposed by Allen Bonde, former vice- president of Innovation at Actuate - now part of OpenText: \\"Small data connects people with timely, meaningful insights (derived from big data and/or ‚Äúlocal‚Äù sources), organized and packaged ‚Äì often visually ‚Äì to be accessible, understandable, and actionable for everyday tasks.\\" Another definition of small data is: * The small set of specific attributes produced by the Internet of Things. These are typically a small set of sensor data such as temperature, wind speed, vibration and status. It was estimated that ‚ÄúIf one takes the top 100 biggest innovations of our time, perhaps around 60% to 65% percent are really based on Small Data.‚Äù as Martin Lindstrom puts it. Small data includes everything from Snapchat to simple objects such as the post-it note. Lindstrom believes we become so focused on Big-Data that we tend to forget about more basic concepts and creativity. Lindstrom defines Small Data \\"as seemingly insignificant observations you identify in consumers‚Äô homes, is everything from how you place your shoes on how you hang your paintings\\". He thus considers that one should perfectly master the basic (Small Data) in order to mine and find correlations. Uses in business=Marketing= Bonde has written about the topic for Forbes, Direct Marketing News, CMO.com and other publications. According to Martin Lindstrom, in his book, Small Data: \\"{In customer research, small data is} Seemingly insignificant behavioural observations containing very specific attributes pointing towards an unmet customer need. Small data is the foundation for breakthrough ideas or completely new ways to turnaround brands.\\" His approach is based on the combination of the observation of small samples with intuition. Marketers can obtain market insights from gathering Small Data by engaging with and observing people in their own environments. In comparison to Big Data, Small Data has the power to trigger emotions and to provide insights into the reasons behind the behaviours of customers. It may uncover detailed information on a person's extroversion or introversion, self-confidence, whether one is having problems in his/her relationship, etc. According to Lindstrom, relationships among people and customer segments are organized around four criteria: # Climate: It reveals for example how a person's environment affects their diet. # Rulership: The power or government in charge # Religion: The prevalence of religion in a country, depending on its influence, indicates whether a person's decision making process is impacted by their belief system. # Tradition: Cultural norms influence people's behaviors and interactions. Many companies underestimate the power of Small Data, using samples of millions of consumers instead of recognizing the value of closely observing small samples in their market research. In his book, Lindstrom defines \\"7Cs\\", which companies should consider in the attempt to derive meaningful customer insights and market trends through small data from their customers: # Collecting: Understanding the manner in which observations are translated inside a home. # Clues: Uncovering other distinctive emotional reflections that can be observed. # Connecting: Identifying the consequences of emotional behaviour. # Causation: Understanding what emotions are being evoked. # Correlation: Identifying the initial date of appearance of the behaviour or emotion. # Compensation: Identifying the unmet or unfulfilled desire. # Concept: Defining the ‚Äúbig idea‚Äù compensation for the identified consumer need. Some of Lindstrom's clients such as Lowes Foods looked at data in a different way and actually chose to live with the customer. ‚ÄúAs you enter their store, they have now created an amazing community where every staff member acts in a character mood, based on Small Data‚Äù. The supermarket made everything it can to make the customer feel at home. All the behaviours of employees are inspired by customer feedbacks gathered from interviews directly done at customer‚Äôs home. =Healthcare= Researchers at Cornell University started developing applications to monitor health problems in patients, based on small data. This is an initiative of Cornell's Small Data Lab,http://smalldata.io/ in close cooperation with Weill Cornell Medicine College, led by Deborah Estrin. The Small Data Lab developed a series of apps, focusing not only on gathering data from patients' pain but also tracking habits in areas such as grocery shopping. In the case of patients with rheumatoid arthritis for example, which has flares and remissions that do not follow a particular cycle, the app gathers information passively, thus allowing to forecast when a flare might be coming up based on small changes in behaviour. Other apps developed also include monitoring online grocery shopping, to use this information from every user to adapt their groceries to the recommendations of nutritionists, or monitoring email language to identify patterns that might indicate \\"fluctuations in cognitive performance, fatigue, side effects of medication or poor sleep, and other conditions and treatments that are typically self-reported and self-medicated\\". = Postal Service = The United States Postal Service (USPS) used optical character recognition (OCR) to automatically read and process 98% of all hand-addressed mail and 99.5% of machine-printed mail. By combining this technology with its small data sample of US zip codes, the USPS can now process more than 36,000 pieces of mail per hour. = Aerospace = In 2015, Boeing established the analytics lab for aerospace data in cooperation with the Carnegie Mellon University to leverage the university's leadership in machine learning, language technologies and data analytics. One of the initiatives projects aims to by standardize maintenance logs using AI to dramatically reduce costs. Currently, there is no standardized procedure to document maintenance logs leading to small but highly unstructured data sets. As a result, it becomes highly difficult for maintenance workers to translate these variations in maintenance logs within a short period of time. However, with AI and a narrow data set of common aircraft maintenance terminology, it becomes possible to dynamically translate these logs in real time. By using AI to enhance the speed and accuracy of the airline maintenance workflow, airlines stand to save billions according to the Harvard Business Review.

Black, 1974, p. 1399 was Professor of Philosophy at Birkbeck College, London (1964-1988), and editor of Mind from 1972 to 1984. Biography Hamlyn was born in 1924. His father was a grocer. He commanded a tank during World War Two in India and the Middle East as part of Hodson's Horse Regiment. Hamlyn's major interests were in Aristotle (whose de Anima, II and III and parts of I, he translated with a commentary, 1968) and in Ludwig Wittgenstein, both of whom influenced Hamlyn's approach to questions in epistemology and philosophy of psychology.Haldane 2005. p. 358. Hamlyn's central thesis, developed in Experience and the Growth of Understanding (1978), Perception, Learning and the Self (1983), and In and Out of the Black Box (1990), was that in order to be a knower a being must be active and seek to regulate its beliefs in accord with a norm of truth: this requires membership of a community, interaction with which involves emotional responses. In short, knowers are social, affective agents.Haldane 2005. p. 358. The other main area of Hamlyn's writing was the history of philosophy.Haldane 2005. p. 358. Over the course of his career, Hamlyn authored twelve books.

The film is an adaptation of the Heinrich von Kleist novella The Earthquake in Chile.Knight, Julia. Women and the New German Cinema. Verso Books, 1992. , 9780860915683. p. 96. Plot Handsome Jeronimo Rugera is hired to tutor the rich heiress, Josephe Asteron. They fall in love, yet the church forbids their relationship, and Josephe is hidden in a convent. When the church discovers she is pregnant, Josephe is sentenced to death by decapitation. Jeronimo tracks her down, yet is jailed before he can rescue her. When fate intervenes in the form of a massive earthquake, the two lovers have no idea what is in store for them. Sanders-Brahms uses a voice-over of the first and final sentences of the book, placing them in the beginning and end of the film. Analysis According to critic Elaine Martin, author of the scholarly article \\"Rewrites and Remakes: Screen Adaptations of Romantic Works,\\" the film director \\"erases the uncanny aspect of Kleist's tale and replaces it with a socio-political explanation\\" and intended to politicize the earthquake narrative's context in a higher degree compared to the original work. For the adaptation Sanders-Brahms uses parallel plotlines that intersect in the end instead of the flashbacks used in the original work. Sanders-Brahms created story segments referred to by Martin as \\"pre-stories, as it were.\\"Martin, p. 671. Martin states that the new segments \\"locate\\" the characters \\"socially and temperamentally.\\" In addition Sanders-Brahms removed the nineteenth century Prussia context, what Martin calls \\"the stage that represents Kleist's narrative filter.\\" The author added that the ending of the film is \\"less sanguine\\" compared to the novella because the director added a \\"veiled reference\\" to the \\"economic value\\" of the surviving child. The child is scheduled to inherit the wealth of the parents, who are dead. She further wrote that in the film Don Fernando is \\"a coolly calculating businessman, shaped by a bourgeois business mentality\\" instead of a \\"divine hero.\\" Cast *Julia Pe√±a as Josephe Asteron (German voice: Maddalena Kerrh) *Victor Alc√°zar as Jeronimo Rugera (German voice: Fred Maire) *Juan Amigo as Don Fernando Ormez (German voice: Manfred Schott) *Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Hoyos as Dona Elvira Ormez (German voice: Lis Kertelge) *Mar√≠a Vico as Dona Elisabeth Ormez (German voice: Helga Tr√ºmper) *Antonio Gamero as Shoemaker Pedrillo (German voice: Bruno W.

Reception Film critic Greg Titian wrote a generally negative review of the film in which he stated that \\"Earthquake in Chile throws the audience into the story with scant setup. Narration at the opening sets the scene in a way that was dissatisfying to this reviewer [...] I felt that Earthquake in Chile made emotional demands on the audience without properly establishing an emotional attachment in the audience to those characters [...] Perhaps I missed the point, or the historical significance of this particular piece of German cinema, but the predictable storyline, in my estimation, ultimately falls a bit flat,\\" though he nevertheless praised the fact that the \\"DVD sports a very high quality transfer.\\" Der Spiegel's critic Siegfried Schober's review made similar negative remarks. Legacy The director made the 1976 film Heinrich because, during work on Earthquake in Chile, she developed an interest in the work's original author.

Whitney was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1870 and served one two-year term. In 1873, he led the effort to incorporate Hinsdale, Illinois. Biography William M. Whitney was born in Ontario, New York on September 23, 1828.Either Ontario, New York or Ontario County, New York. He became a teacher in 1848 and married Sarah Lavilla Clark in 1851. Whitney came to Winfield, Illinois in 1858. Two years later, he was elected DuPage County Circuit Clerk and Recorder. He served in this role until 1868. Whitney moved to Naperville, then the DuPage County seat, in 1862. Six years later, the seat was moved to Wheaton, which may have caused Whitney to not seek re-election in his role. He was admitted to the bar in 1868, but never practiced law. Starting in 1865, Whitney became involved with real estate dealings. In 1868, he platted one of the first subdivisions in Downers Grove with Charles W. Richmond. By 1870, Whtiney was worth $17,000. In 1870, Whitney was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives as the only representation from DuPage County. He served in the 27th General Assembly.

From 1872 to 1876, Whitney was a member of the State Board of Equalization, a tax assessment board. The Panic of 1873 ruined Whitney financially. By 1879, Whitney was deeply in debt and sold his house to pay back taxes. Whitney served as Hinsdale's police magistrate from 1878 to 1880. In 1879, he took a position managing accounts for the Illinois Eastern Hospital for the Insane, where he worked for eight years. Sarah Whitney died in 1880.

The community flourished from the 18th-early 20th century, following the confirmation of certain privileges granted to Polish Jews in 1659. The community had its own synagogues, yeshivas, beit midrash, mikveh, schools, and community center. By the 19th century, the majority of the general population of ≈Åuk√≥w was Jewish, with many people working in a shoe factory. Members of the community followed various movements, including Hasidic Judaism, socialism, labor movements, and Zionism. The majority of the Jewish community of ≈Åuk√≥w was murdered in the Holocaust. There were only about 150 survivors in total, most of whom had left for the Soviet Union.  Early history (15th-17th century)  At the turn of the 15th century, Jews began to settle in ≈Åuk√≥w. Some sources claim that Jews came as early as the mid-13th century. By the 16th century, an organized Jewish community was in place. The first synagogue in the town was built in the 16th century, although it later burned down in a fire. In 1648, the Khmelnytsky uprising as part of the Cossack Uprisings, led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky, resulted in attacks and heavy losses for the Jewish community of ≈Åuk√≥w, which also saw numerous marches and stopovers by armies. In 1655, the Jewish community experienced a pogrom, which had been organized by the Muscovites and impacted many parts of Poland. The local community of ≈Åuk√≥w had 1000 deaths. The new synagogue was set on fire and many Jewish households were also destroyed. This was followed by the Swedish Deluge (1657), during the war between Poland and Sweden, which involved invasions ordered by King Carl Gustav and his Transylvanian ally, the Rakocy prince. This period brought fatal effects to the town. In April 1657, the town was totally devastated by the invasion of Swedish and Transylvanian troops, and about 1000 Jews lost their lives.  Privileges & reconstruction (17th-18th century)  In 1659, King Jan Kazimierz Waza granted certain privileges to the Jews of Poland. This included the right to acquire real estate, conduct business, and produce and sell alcoholic drinks. These laws helped facilitate the growth of the town, and by 1676, ≈Åuk√≥w had one of the largest Jewish communities in the region. In the 1760s-1770s, the Jewish community of ≈Åuk√≥w focused on rebuilding the town. In 1765, 543 Jewish people (137 families) lived in ≈Åuk√≥w. In the latter half of the 18th century, ≈Åuk√≥w experienced an economic boom. Jews typically lived in the Market Square and on Kozia Street, with some living on Browarna Street. Some rented three taverns in Jurydyka, which was a settlement outside a royal city. The center of Jewish life in ≈Åuk√≥w was found between Brzeska, Ko≈õcielna, and Trzebieska Streets. Two new synagogues were built, with one located at the corner of Staropijarska and B√≥≈ºnicza Streets. A beit midrash and mikveh were also located on Trzebieska Street.  19th century  By the 19th century, the Jewish population saw population growth. By 1827, the number of Jewish people grew to 2,023 (which accounted for 60% of the town population). In 1857, there were 2,114 Jewish people (68% of the town population). By the mid-19th century, the Jewish community owned a synagogue, a brick beit midrash, a wooden mikvah (located on Staropijarska Street), and a two-room wooden shelter. During this period, Hasidic Judaism was very popular in the Jewish community. The town had a few shtibelekh, which were meeting places for the supporters from Kock, Radzy≈Ñ Podlaski, Aleksandr√≥w ≈Å√≥dzki, and G√≥ra Kalwaria. By 1897, there were 4,799 Jewish people (55% of the town population).  Early 20th century  In 1901, Szmuel Szlomi Braun became the rabbi of the town. He ran a popular yeshiva in town. In 1905, the Russian Revolution left a profound impact on many Jews of ≈Åuk√≥w, most of whom were poor. Common professions were tailor, shoemaker, baker, and porter. According to the accounts of Shloyme Rubinshteyn, some members of the town became socialists and labor activists. A man named Yakov (the son of Moshe Kiwi), the brothers and sisters Luterman, and others created a Bund. However, many of the members of the Bund eventually fled to the United States, due to the repressive tactics of the Czar's authorities. From 1906-07, the town saw economic growth, as multiple factories opened. In 1906, Gastman's shoe factory, originally from Warsaw, relocated to ≈Åuk√≥w. This helped bring an economic revival to the town, and it employed hundreds of town residents. A small shoe factory was opened by Yosef Mendel Hochman and an album factory was opened by Meir Liberman. These two factories employed dozens of workers. In 1906, a mansion was built for Hersz Morgenstern, the great-grandson Mendel Morgenstern (the tzaddik of Kock), in ≈Åuk√≥w. During this period, the Zionist movement became increasingly popular in ≈Åuk√≥w. Under the leadership of Hershel Eisenberg, lessons were taught to residents about Israel and Zionism. A library was also established, although it wasn't legal to do so. In 1912, the library brought Hillel Zeitlin to speak. Later, Reuben Brainin was also brought to speak. In 1914, the first public concert in the town was arranged, which consisted of Jewish folk music and took place at the Dom Ludowy (community center). The group hoped to establish a legal library, but the request was rejected by Czarist authorities.  WWI  With the outbreak of WWI, most small businesses ceased operation in ≈Åuk√≥w. Gastman's shoe factory only operated part-time. As a result, many Jewish families lost their income. In 1915, Poland was occupied by the Austrian army, which the Jewish population generally preferred over the Cossacks (due to their pogroms). The Austrian forces later left, and the German forces took their place. The Germans evacuated Jews from Brisk and dispersed them to other towns, including ≈Åuk√≥w. Volunteer programs were set up to help provide food and shelter to the new homeless Jews who had arrived in town. A typhus epidemic broke out, and the town was given permission to build a hospital by the German authorities. The residents of ≈Åuk√≥w began to grow accustomed to German occupation, and remnants of their former lives before the war began to resume. In 1916, political parties began to sprout up, starting with the Bund and the youth group, Bund - Tsukunft (future). They invited various lecturers from Warsaw to speak. The Folkspartei (\\"Jewish People's Party\\") was also established. Other groups were the Poalei Zion Right with the Hapoel sports club. Other groups were the General Zionists and the Hashomer Hatzair, which organized lectures and many Jewish youth activities. In 1918, WWI ended and Poland became an independent state.  Interwar period  Following WWI, the Jewish community of ≈Åuk√≥w received a letter promising financial support from the American Jewish community. The Bund met to discuss how to distribute the money. They agreed by majority to distribute the money to the town's poor population through goods. Most political groups supported the measure, except for Agudat Yisrael and the General Zionists. During this time, there was notable political organizing among various socialist, communist, and labor groups in ≈Åuk√≥w. As recalled by Shloyme Rubinshteyn, in discussing a meeting of the period, \\"Red flags flew. The speeches were given in Polish and Yiddish. It was a striking picture. Everyone believed that a new era of truth and justice for all people has arrived.\\" Other political groups also flourished in this period. Some of the most active included the General Zionist Party, Poale Zion Right, Mizrachi, Folkspartei, and Aguda. Left-wing Zionist organizations included Tsukunft, Ha-Shomer Ha-Tzair, Hehalutz, and Betar. The most influential group was Aguda, which was Orthodox Jewish, and almost exclusively controlled the Jewish Community Co-operative until 1931. The interwar period brought increased prosperity for the Jews of ≈Åuk√≥w. In 1921, 6,145 Jews lived in ≈Åuk√≥w, which accounted for 49% of the total inhabitants. They ran 85% of 530 local industrial and commercial companies and created 30 associations. The Jewish community issued a weekly publication, Dos ≈Åukower Wort, and several issues of ≈Åukower Nayes were published in 1931. In terms of education, the town offered four private chederim, at least two schools for Talmud Torah, and a private school that went up to the fourth- grade (which was operated by the Mizrachi party). In 1923, the school became a public state school. From 1928-mid-1930s, an elementary school (until the fourth grade) was also active in town, and it as run by the TSIShO (Central Yiddish School Organisation). Economic prospects for Jewish youth were often limited in ≈Åuk√≥w. As Shloyme Rubinshteyn, a former resident recalled, > There were two high schools in the city, for boys and for girls, but it was > possible to count the Jewish high school students on the fingers - first, > because of the high tuition and secondly, because of the anti-Semitic > discrimination. For example, I remember a high school student, Reuven > Fluman. His father had a shoe store and he has done everything so that his > son, a boy with a 'flaming head' will become a 'man.'

They bragged about the cinemas, > theaters, and the restaurants where they ate, but they weren't able to tell > the truth that two of them slept in one bed and at times they didn't have > money to buy food. The interwar period was marked by growing anti-Semitic actions and commercial boycotts. In 1920, a pogrom took place. In August, when the Polish army was waging a counteroffensive in the war against Bolsheviks, 12 Jews were executed without any trial by the soldiers in the neighborhood of ≈Åuk√≥w. The pogrom went on for two days in the town itself. Officers did not try to stop it, allowing soldiers to plunder shops and hit Jewish inhabitants. With the arrival of the Great Depression in the 1930s, the town began to fall on hard times. Some industrial plants closed down, and unemployment went up. Anti- semitism also began to began to rise, and Polish nationalists rallied for boycotts of Jewish businesses and workshops. Some businesses were devastated at that time. This period also had the last rabbi of ≈Åuk√≥w: Aron Nuta Frajberg.  World War II  On September 19, 1939, German forces seized the town. Some Jews tried to defend the town. German forces shot down several Jewish people and burned down 25 Jewish houses in retaliation. A few days later, the Soviet Army entered the town. In October 1939, the Soviet forces retreated, which resulted in 500 Jews fleeing town. World War II led to the total extermination of the Jewish community in ≈Åuk√≥w. Before this happened, the town was a stopover on the way to the gas chambers for thousands of Jews from the neighboring villages, many Polish towns, and even from other countries. Between November and December 1939, more than 2,500 Jews from Serock, Nasielsk, and Suwa≈Çki were displaced to ≈Åuk√≥w. A year later, this was followed by almost 1000 Jews from M≈Çawa, and, in May 1942, more than 2,000 Jews from Slovakia. The first mass executions of ≈Åuk√≥w Jews started in March 1942. At that time, Germans shot 47 people. In the summer the Jews were forbidden to leave the town. A regular action of liquidation of the Jewish community started on October 5, 1942. On that day, about 4,000 people were transported to the Treblinka extermination camp and about 500 were executed in the town (the last rabbi of the community, Aaron Note Freiberg, was among them). Another 2,000 people were transported to Treblinka on October 8, 1942. After this action, the area of ghetto was decreased and the Jews from the neighboring towns and villages, such as Kock, Wojcieszk√≥w, Adam√≥w, Stanin, Tuchowicz, Trzebiesz√≥w and Ulan, were forced to come to ≈Åuk√≥w. After that, between October 26-27 and between November 7-11, another 4,000 people were taken to Treblinka. A few hundred more Jews were executed at the court of the ≈Åuk√≥w magistrate and in the Jewish cemetery. The Jews who survived were closed in the ghetto at the beginning of December, and there were regular executions. The ghetto was finally liquidated on 2 May 1943, when SS troops deported about 4,000 people to Treblinka. In summary, from 1942 and 1943, around 14,000 Jews from the ≈Åuk√≥w ghetto and the neighboring towns and villages were sent to the gas chambers in Treblinka, and approximately 2,000 Jews were executed in the town. In this way the Jewish community in ≈Åuk√≥w ended.http://www.lukow.pl/images/studium/historia.pdf  Survivors  Following WWII, it was estimated that about 150 Jews from ≈Åuk√≥w survived. The majority had left for the Soviet Union. After the war, many settled in Silesia and later moved to Western Europe, Israel, or the United States. In 1950, only six Jews lived in ≈Åuk√≥w. In 1968, a memorial book The Book of Lukow: Dedicated to a Destroyed Community was published in Tel Aviv, Israel, which included memories of former town residents.

The hamlet at the intersection of Fifth Line East (now Torbram Road) and Britannia Road was once a thriving 19th century rural community. It was later cleared for expansion of the Toronto Pearson International Airport. A part of the original Britannia Rd. still exists, now as a street east of the airport named \\"Elmbank Road\\". Nothing remains of the former community. History Land in the area was cleared for farming beginning in the mid 1820s. The first resident was John Grubb, who emigrated from Scotland in 1831. Grubb built a home overlooking Etobicoke Creek, and named the place Elmbank. Other settlers followed, and the Elmbank community soon had a blacksmith, store, inn, schoolhouse, cheese factory, carriage maker, and Sons of Temperance Society Hall. No mills were located there. The Elmbank Post Office operated from 1873 to 1915, and the first postmaster, William McKay, operated out of his store. Shell's Chapel was built south of the community in 1831, named after Jacob and Henry Shell. The chapel was renamed Bethany Wesleyan Methodist Church and Cemetery, and then Bethany United Church in 1925. The last service was held in 1956, and the graves were relocated to Riverside Cemetery in Etobicoke. Elmbank was noted for its importance to Toronto's Catholic community. The Catholic Mission and Cemetery, a log church constructed in 1833, was located in Elmbank and parishioners would travel from Toronto for mass or funerals. In 1885, a red brick church and rectory replaced the log church. The last recorded mass took place in 1915, and the church was torn down in 1932. Materials from the church such as pews, bricks and stained glass windows were reused in neighbouring churches. Residents of Elmbank had a close association with the community of Malton, located a short distance northeast. The Elmbank soccer team, composed of young men from Elmbank and Malton, won the Peel league championship. Residents of Elmbank also participated in Malton's day-long Callithumpian Parade, held annually beginning in 1896. The Sons of Temperance Society Hall was also used occasionally for lectures organized by the Malton Women's Institute, founded in 1906. Elmbank's population peaked at 300 in 1886, and had declined to about 30 by 1926. In 1937, the Toronto Harbour Commission selected Malton as the site for Toronto's airport. The rural land near Elmbank was expropriated and its buildings demolished for successive expansions of the airport. By the 1950s, the only visible remnant of the Elmbank community was the Catholic cemetery. Cemetery relocation The Catholic cemetery, also called the Elmbank/Fifth Line Cemetery, was used for over 600 burials, the last taking place in 1937. Access to the cemetery was limited after that, as it was located on airport property. The cemetery was damaged by Hurricane Hazel in 1954, after which most of the headstones were moved, though 23 headstones remained, delineating both individual and family plots. In the 1990s, plans were started to permit the building of an east-west runway, and the associated taxiway would have directly affected what remained of the cemetery. An application was submitted to relocate the graves. Archaeological Services Incorporated (ASI) was hired in 2000 to assist with the cemetery's relocation. Excavation of the site began in 2001, when ASI located the stone foundation of the red brick church and rectory, as well as fragments of ceramics and stained glass. The headstones were removed, and 622 bodies were exhumed. By October 2001, the Elmbank Cemetery had been completely relocated to the Assumption Cemetery, a short distance northwest of the airport. It was the largest historic cemetery relocation in Ontario history. Living descendants were consulted and records of the area were researched so that the graves could be placed at the new site as close as possible to their original placements. Attention was paid to maintaining the closeness of family members. A final mass was celebrated at the old cemetery on August 27, 2000, and on July 10, 2004, a mass took place for the relocated dead at Assumption Cemetery.

It is native to several Greek islands, Turkey, Syria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Israel, Lebanon and southwestern parts of the Russian Federation. Description The ring-headed dwarf snake is a pencil-thin species that grows to a maximum length of but most adults are considerably smaller than this. The skin is smooth and the edges of the scales are slightly darker than the centres. The upper surface of the body is a uniform yellowish-brown, greyish-brown or reddish-brown colour and the underparts are glossy white. The top of the head has a large black blotch inside which are either two whitish spots or a pale \\"W\\"-shaped mark. Round the neck is a crescent-shaped band of dark blotches separated from the head by a pale band.  Subspecies  Currently, three subspecies are recognized, namely Eirenis modestus modestus (MARTIN 1838), E. m. semimaculatus (BOETTGER 1876) from central and western Turkey (Anatolia), and E. m. cilicius (SCHMIDTLER 1993) from southern Turkey. Distribution and habitat The ring-headed dwarf snake is native to the Greek Mediterranean islands of Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Alzonisi, Kalymnos, Leros, Symi and Megisti and most of Turkey. Its range extends eastwards into the Caucasus Mountains, eastern Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Its natural habitats are dry shrubby vegetation, cultivated fields, fallow areas and dry open woodland. Behaviour During the day the ring-headed dwarf snake shelters under stones or in crevices, and several snakes may share the same hiding place. It emerges at twilight to hunt for spiders, insects, centipedes, scorpions and small lizards. Breeding takes place in summer when the female lays a clutch of three to eight relatively large eggs. The hatchlings are up to about long. Status The ring-headed dwarf snake has a wide range and is presumed to have a large total population. It seems to be an adaptable species able to tolerate a range of different habitat types, and no particular threats have been identified and for these reasons, the IUCN has listed it as being of \\"Least Concern\\".

It is one of several current units with extensive Colonial era roots and campaign credit for the War of 1812. The 103rd Engineer Battalion traces its origins to the Associators, constituted on 21 November 1747, at Philadelphia by Benjamin Franklin. The original Associators included several companies of artillery, which were combined on 29 December 1747, to form the Train of Artillery of Philadelphia. It is from these artillery companies that the 103rd Engineer Battalion is derived. During the French and Indian War, these companies served at Forts Pitt and Erie. In 1775 when the Associated Regiment of Foot of Philadelphia was reorganized as the Associators of the City and Liberties of Philadelphia, it included one battalion of artillery. On 1 May 1775, this artillery battalion underwent further reorganization to form the Philadelphia Artillery Battalion under the command of Colonel Samuel Mifflin. Its Revolutionary War Campaigns include the Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, and New Jersey 1777. The Philadelphia Artillery Battalion was ordered into Continental Service on 2 July 1776, at Philadelphia, and mustered out in January 1777 at Morristown, New Jersey. During this period, the unit served in New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and participated in the Trenton and Princeton campaigns. *While remaining in state service, the Philadelphia Artillery Battalion also formed Procter's 4th Company, organized in Philadelphia in October 1775, and was expanded to form the Pennsylvania State Artillery Battalion in August 1776, which was assigned to the Main Continental Army in September 1776. The Pennsylvania State Artillery Battalion was expanded again to form the Pennsylvania State Artillery Regiment in February 1777, and relieved from the Main Continental Army. On 10 June 1777, the Pennsylvania State Artillery Regiment was adopted into the Continental Army as Procter's Continental Artillery Regiment, which became the 4th Continental Artillery Regiment in 1783.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 103rd Engineer Battalion. At the Battle of Fort Washington, Margaret (‚ÄúCaptain Molly‚Äù) Corbin, the wife on an enlisted man in one of the companies of the Philadelphia Artillery Battalion, became the first American woman to be wounded on the battlefield and later the first woman to be paid a pension by the U. S. government for her service. When her husband, John Corbin, was killed during the assault on Fort Tryon, a small outer redoubt of Fort Washington, she took his place in the gun crew, cleaning and loading the cannon. She was seriously wounded by grapeshot shortly before the Hessians overran the battery. Margaret was put on the rolls of the Invalid Regiment at West Point. She died in Highland Fall, New York, in 1800 at the age of 49. She is buried in the post cemetery.Edward 1971, pp. 385-386. Another story about another \\"Molly\\" who distinguished herself on the battlefield has come down to us from the Battle of Monmouth, which was fought on a sweltering day in late June 1778. According to the legend of Molly Pitcher, Mary Hays, the wife of William Hays, a soldier in Proctor‚Äôs 4th Continental Artillery, was bringing pitchers of water from a nearby spring to the cannon crews when she saw her husband collapse. Mary is then reported to have picked up the rammer, joined the gun crew, and continued to work the cannon for the rest of the battle. It is further reported that for her heroism General Washington warranted her as a non-commissioned officer and awarded her a pension for life. There are eyewitness accounts that verify that Mary was present at the battle, that there was a woman bringing water to the cannon crews, and that a woman was seen assisting her husband at a gun. There is no record of any woman receiving a military title after the battle or any record of Mary receiving a federal pension (although she did receive a pension from the State of Pennsylvania for her war service, not her husband‚Äôs). Her contemporaries referred to Mary as \\"Captain Molly\\" or \\"Sergeant Molly,\\" not as \\"Molly Pitcher.\\" The name \\"Molly Pitcher\\" appeared in print for the first time in 1837 and was greatly popularized by the painting \\"Molly Pitcher: Heroine of Monmouth,\\" by Nathaniel Currier. William Hays survived the war, after which he and Mary settled in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. William died in 1789, after which Mary married another Revolutionary War veteran, George McCauley. She died in 1832, and is buried in Carlisle.Landis 1905, pp. 13-14. Beginning in 1784 and culminating in 1794, Proctor‚Äôs Artillery Battalion and the Philadelphia Artillery Battalion were consolidated to form the Regiment of Artillery of the City of Philadelphia, which was mustered into federal service during the War of 1812 as the Regiment of Artillery. Thus the Battalion is among Army National Guard units with campaign credit for the War of 1812. The current 103rd Engineer Battalion's lineage is traced to the 1st Regiment, Infantry, Pennsylvania National Guard. This regiment was in federal service on the Mexican Border (during the Pancho Villa Expedition) from June to October 1916. On 5 August 1917, it was drafted into federal service and became the 109th Infantry Regiment. However, it was redesignated to the 1st Infantry, Pennsylvania National Guard in October 1919. The 1st Infantry was converted and redesignated as 103rd Engineer Regiment, an element of the 28th Infantry Division 1 April 1921. The 103rd Engineer Regiment was an element of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard's 28th Division.Pennsylvania's Historic Regiments: The 103rd Engineers, accessed January 2014. It was organized and federally recognized in Philadelphia, Pa. 18 July 1921. It was inducted into Federal service for World War II in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 17 February 1941. On 17 February 1942, the regiment was broken up and its elements reorganized and redesignated as follows: Regiment (less the 2nd Battalion) as the 103rd Engineer Battalion, an element of the 28th Infantry Division. The 2nd Battalion was redesignated as the 180th Engineer Battalion and relieved from assignment to the 28th Infantry Division. On 1 August 1942, the 180th Engineer Battalion was redesignated as the 180th Engineer Heavy Pontoon Battalion. On 27 November 1945, the 180th Engineer Heavy Pontoon Battalion was inactivated at Camp Miles Standish, Massachusetts. On 24 May 1946, the 103rd Combat Battalion (the 103rd Engineer Battalion was redesignated the 103rd Combat Battalion 9 March 1943) and the 180th Engineer Heavy Pontoon Battalion consolidated and were designated as the 103rd Engineer Combat Battalion.

Location Grant is a rural community close to the Snake River. It is west- southwest of Rigby. and north of Idaho Falls. History Grant was known historically as Poverty Flat. The land was predominantly sagebrush, with wildlife trails bringing the first pioneers to the area in the late 1870s and early 1880s.Picture History of Jefferson County, Jefferson County Historical Museum, Rigby, ID. Visited May 8, 2015 The first settlers were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), second generation to those who had arrived in the Salt Lake valley in the mid 1800s. Alfred Kossuth DaBell and James Ottowell Webster established the first homesteads in Poverty Flat in 1888. They spent that initial winter with family members in the nearby town of Lewisville, then began to build their farms in the spring of 1889. The first permanent settler in Poverty Flat was Jeppe Peter Hansen, originally from Denmark, who arrived just before the DaBells and the Websters returned from Lewisville. Between 1891 and 1892, the community constructed a small building to be used as both church and school and the Grant School District was organized. The Grant Ward of the LDS Church was also established that year, named after Heber J. Grant, the 7th President of the LDS Church. The first postmaster, Frederick C. Hanson, was appointed on March 3, 1893. The post office was connected to the \\"Grant Store,\\" which remained in continuous operation for over 100 years until the late 1990s. In 1900, the Grant Ward was composed of 77 families and 389 individuals. The community grew significantly through the early twentieth century, resulting in the construction of several new buildings and a baseball diamond. The \\"Grant Hall,\\" built in 1900, became a social center for the area, with people coming from all over the Snake River valley to attend weekly dances. On July 4, 1920, a group of local cowboys and farmers held a rodeo on the baseball diamond.

In 1885 he married Mary Venetia Cavendish-Bentinck (1861‚Äì1948), godmother to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Early years James‚Äôs parents were Daniel and Sophia James, Americans domiciled in Liverpool, England. He was educated privately at Woodbridge in Suffolk and admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, on 24 February 1870 graduating BA in 1874. After his father died in 1876, James joined the family business, but left in 1879. He enjoyed a period of bachelorhood with his two brothers, Frank and William, living in London, shooting in Scotland and big game hunting in Africa. Together they explored uncharted areas of Africa, and Frank, who was a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, published details on their return. Horseracing In 1885 James married Mary Venetia Cavendish- Bentinck, who was the daughter of George Cavendish-Bentinck and Prudentia Penelope Leslie. They lived in Grafton Street, London, and Coton House near Rugby where they bred racehorses. On the racetrack their successes included: * Goodwood Cup: 1901 Fortunatus; 1902 Perseus; 1903 Rabelais. * Coronation Stakes: 1899 Fascination. * New Stakes (Norfolk Stakes): 1899 The Gorgon. * Windsor Castle Stakes: 1902 Mabon; 1903 Huntly; 1904 Chain Stitch. * National Breeders Stakes: 1902 Rabelais. * 2,000 Guineas Stakes: 1906 Gorgos Venetia James was related to the Duke of Portland, owner of racehorse St. Simon, so it was probably no coincidence that the blood line of many of the foals born at Coton House can be traced back to this great horse. After James died, his wife continued to breed and race; she won the Victoria Cup at Hurst Park Racecourse with Phalaros and Herbalist in successive years and the 1932 Coronation Cup with Salmon Leap. James, who was a Steward of the Jockey Club, placed his racehorses with trainer Richard Marsh at Egerton House, Newmarket at the same period as the facility was being used by the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII). James and his wife Venetia were friends with the Prince. Frederick Ponsonby (private secretary to the Prince) wrote of this friendship: ‚Äúhe (James) charming, but not having so much in common with the King except racing; she full of humour and high spirits, walking with the King and keeping him amused.‚Äù . Edward VII found that training his horses with Richard Marsh was a financial burden. Marsh had spent lavishly on his establishment and this was reflected in his charges. At one point Arthur James tried to persuade the Prince to move his horses, however, Marsh, fearing the loss of the royal patronage, asked Lillie Langtry to intercede on his behalf. Langtry, who was a friend of the Prince, sent for James and told him that she considered it a great responsibility for him to encourage the Prince of Wales to move stables. James, perhaps considering that Langtry‚Äôs influence with the King outranked his own, took the hint and allowed the matter to drop. Submerging Boat Company In 1891 James was the chairman of The Submerging Boat Company Limited in partnership with naval architect W. C. Storey. Shipbuilder Day, Summers & Co. of Southampton, constructed a submarine for them of a cylindrical design, 96 ft in length, 9 ft 6in in diameter and weighing 126 tons.The Submerging Boat Company; The Times-page 19; May 28, 1892 The vessel, named Nautilus and later renamed Incognita was constructed in iron, with steam engines for surface running and electric motors for use when submerged.Sale of Incognita;Hampshire Advertiser ‚Äìpage 4; Saturday April 2, 1892 The submarine sunk at its moorings before its first trial, and although raised by the insurers, the Submerging Boat Company went bankrupt. A dispute arose between the designer of the Incognita and the shipbuilder Day, Summers & Co. over who was to blame for the sinking and this dispute went to court. Day, Summers & Co. had some experience of working on ships with similar hull shapes; in 1877 they had modified the Walter S. Winans, a vessel designed by Ross Winans and nicknamed The Cigar Ship. The work they carried out, more than double its length and triple its displacement. Public life Arthur James held the following positions in public life: * Justice of the Peace; * selected as the Liberal Unionist Party parliamentary candidate in 1892 for the Rugby division of Warwickshire (although failed to be elected); * Sheriff of Warwickshire for 1916; * Deputy- lieutenant for Warwickshire; * Steward of the Jockey Club He received the following honours: * Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) appointed by King Edward VII in 1909.http://www.london- gazette.co.uk/issues/28269/pages/5282 * Knight of Grace of Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem in England 13 August 1902. Both Venetia and Arthur James were generous benefactors to hospitals and other causes. Family Mrs Mary Venetia James, n√©e Cavendish-Bentinck (Samuel Luke Fildes, 1895) James died in 1917 and was buried in a cemetery at West Dean, West Sussex, where his two brothers and other members of the family lie, including Venetia. His elder brother, Frank, had died in 1890 from a hunting accident in Africa. The death of Frank came as a terrible blow to both Arthur and his brother William. As a memorial, he and Arthur funded the building of a hospital for mariners in the town of East Cowes, Isle of Wight, named the Frank James Memorial Hospital. William James died in 1912. Venetia James was related to, and godmother of Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon, the future queen consort of the United Kingdom who, following the death of her husband King George VI, became Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. When Venetia died in 1948, she left jewellery to Queen Elizabeth and pictures by Titian, Reynolds and Gainsborough to the National Gallery, London. Arthur and Venetia James were childless. His paternal half brother was Daniel Willis James, co- partner of Phelps, Dodge & Co. His half sister was Olivia James who married Robert Hoe III. His nephew was Edward James.

Scientific collections dealing specifically with organisms plants, fungi, animals, insects and their remains, may also be called natural history collections or biological collections. The latter may contain either living stocks or preserved repositories of biodiversity specimens and materials. Scientific collections hold a tangible portion of the cumulative evidence base in such fields as biology (especially taxonomy and evolutionary biology), geology, and archaeology. They may be stored and managed by governments, educational institutions (e.g. colleges and universities), private organizations (including museums), or individuals. Prominent uses of scientific collections include the systematic description and identification of biological species, the study and prediction of long-term historical trends (including impacts of climate change), the dating and analysis of historical objects (e.g. via wood samples and ice cores with annual rings), and the maintenance of teaching resources.Preparation of a plant for a Herbarium Ornithological collection at the Museum of Comparative Zoology of Natural history of Harvard Museum of Natural History. Museum collections are tremendous repositories of specimens and data of many sorts, including phenotypes, tissue samples, vocal recordings, geographic distributions, parasites, and diet. View in a Seedbank at the Western Regional Plant Introduction Station  Indexing  The indexing of the collections was historically made by directories, catalogs, index cards, today supplemented by or replaced by databases with information such as e.g. scientific description, including picture, name, location, find circumstances, fund age, scientific analysis, phylogenetic relationships, DNA and isotope analysis results, analysis of pollutants, references, condition of the property, owner changes and name changes.Die Sammlungen  Deutsche Naturwissenschaftliche Forschungssammlung Many organizations support the indexing and handling of their collections by specialist libraries.  Institutions  Research collections hold especially museums, notably natural history museums, botanical gardens, universities and other research institutions. There are also independent research collections, such as the Zoological State Collection Munich with over 20 million stuffed animals for research purposes. Public authorities such as national geological agencies or police units hold partly research collections too. The Natural History Museum in London - with one of the biggest collections worldwide - is home to life and earth science specimens comprising some 70 million items within five main collections: botany, entomology, mineralogy, palaeontology and zoology. Largest German Natural History Museum is the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, Berlin, with over 30 million objects, including 9 million beetles and 275,000 jars with preserved in alcohol animals.  Geology / Earth Sciences collections  Remarkable Earth Sciences collections: * In Germany the Technische Universit√§t Bergakademie Freiberg has particularly rich geological research collections. This includes 80,000 minerals in the Mineralogical Collection, 120,000 samples from deposits in the deposit collection, 16,000 rocks in the petrological collection, 114,000 macro - and almost a million micro-fossils in the fossil collection, 70,000 macro - and microfossils 12,000 and 15,000 lithostratigraphically or facies relevant rock samples and about 14,000 specimens and sections in the Stratigraphic collection, 30,000 pieces of evidence and 30,000 preparations and cuts in Fuel Geological Collection and 34,000 objects in the central body of evidence Lithothek. * The IODP/ODP - Kernlager / Bremen Core Repository (BCR) at the University of Bremen has a collection of 140 km of drill core from the Ocean Drilling Program with 190,000 individual pieces, which are stored in a 1.100m ¬≤ large cold storage at 4 ¬∞C.IODP/ODP - Kernlager / Bremen Core Repository (BCR), Universit√§t Bremen ¬∑ Universit√§tssammlungen in Deutschland *The Mus√©e de Min√©ralogie a museum of mineralogy operated by the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des mines de Paris (Mines ParisTech) containing some 100,000 samples including 80,000 minerals, 15,000 rocks, 4,000 ores, 400 meteorites, 700 gems, and 300 artificial minerals. * The most important geological collections in Europe include the Museum of the Earth of Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw With more than 170,000 minerals, meteorites, fossil and an Amber collection.  Biological collections / Life Sciences collections  Typical collection objects biology are fossils of organisms, in particular plants and animals, plants, and animals killed, and be protected from decay, for example, by drying or preparation, but also live plants, animals, bacteria and viruses. Plant collections are referred to as herbaria. Live plants are collected in the Botanical gardens, (trees ) in arboretums, aquariums, and partly in seedbanks, as well as e.g. algae from the Culture Collection of Algae G√∂ttingen. Live animals are collected in zoos and aquariums. The great Old Botanical Garden of the University of G√∂ttingen e.g. represents about a collection of 17,000 species.Georg-August-Universit√§t G√∂ttingen - Alter Botanischer Garten Particularly well known in Germany are the major research collections of the Naturmuseum Senckenberg of Senckenberg Society for Nature Research in Frankfurt am Main with over 22 million natural objects (Herbaria 1 Million). Senckenberg offers to open up his collection to the SESAM database. The Macaulay Library is the world's largest archive of animal sounds. It includes more than 175,000 audio recordings covering 75 percent of the world's bird species. There are an ever increasing numbers of insect, fish, frog, and mammal recordings.

Christ Church Cathedral is the cathedral church for the Episcopal Diocese of Texas. Early life and education Thompson was born on November 17, 1972 in Paragould, Arkansas. He is the younger brother of Robert F. Thompson, a former member of the Arkansas state senate. Thompson was raised a Methodist, with his early formation in the United Methodist Church contributing to his vocation to pastoral ministry. While in college, Thompson was encouraged to visit a local Episcopal parish church by one of his college professors. About his experience of walking into the church, Thompson has said, \\"The moment I crossed the threshold from narthex to nave, I had a deep sense that I had come home\\". He joined the Episcopal Church shortly thereafter, which he has described as combining \\"the Methodist theology of hospitality and grace\\" with \\"Catholic sacramental and liturgical worship\\". Thompson graduated with a BA, magna cum laude, from Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas in 1995, where he also received the college's President's Medal, presented to the student who best exemplifies the school's highest ideals. Thompson went on to earn an MA degree from the University of Chicago Divinity School in 1998. His oral defense paper was entitled, \\"Toward a Christology of Purpose: The Early Royce and the Incarnation.\\" Thompson later earned the Master of Divinity degree from the Episcopal Theological Seminary of the Southwest in Austin, Texas. Currently, Thompson serves on the Seminary of the Southwest's Board of Trustees. Career Following his seminary education, Thompson was ordained first a deacon and then a priest by Bishop Don E. Johnson in the Diocese of West Tennessee of the Episcopal Church. In 2003, he was assigned to his first pastoral appointment as vicar (and later rector) of the Church of the Holy Apostles in Collierville, Tennessee. The congregation numbered only about 40 communicants when he arrived. Under his leadership the parish reorganized and expanded, growing from 40 parishioners to over 400 in just four years.Tom Bailey, Jr., \\"Minister leaving for Va.--C'ville's Holy Apostles losing rector,\\" Commercial Appeal (August 3, 2007). In 2007, Thompson became the rector at St. John's Episcopal Church in the heart of Roanoke, Virginia. While there, he led the parish in pursuing ‚Äúinnovative-yet-still- traditional forms of worship, new programs for Christian formation, outreach initiatives and enhanced Christian community‚Äù. His ministry at St. John's was marked by congregational growth, development of new programming, and the establishment of a parish endowment. In 2009, Thompson also led the parish in a restoration of its historic 117-year-old church. Thompson was called in 2013 to be the eighth dean and twentieth rector of Christ Church Cathedral in Houston, Texas. In that capacity, he also chairs the board of The Beacon, which is Houston's largest social service day center for the homeless. Thompson also serves on the North American Committee for St. George's College in Jerusalem, the Anglican Center in the Holy Land and on the board of Episcopal High School in Houston. Views=Theology and preaching= Thompson's theological approach emphasizes communicating the Christian gospel inductively and narratively through storytelling. This approach is visible both in his preaching and in his published work. Thompson's technique combines the presentation of biblical stories or doctrines with stories of common life to illuminate key themes of the gospel in a way intended to be accessible to Christian audiences.See, e.g., Barkley Thompson, \\"The Barber Shop and Sabbath Time\\", Ratherview: Official Magazine of the Episcopal Theological Seminary of the Southwest 23:2 (2001): 6‚Äì7. It is a way of communicating theology practically that has been described as ‚Äú[combining] stories from Scripture and stories from everyday life‚Äù. Thompson's approach is developed most fully in Elements of Grace, where he couches his characteristically narrative style in meditations that are organized thematically into the \\"elemental\\" categories of Earth, Water, Spirit, Light, Darkness, Discipleship, and Word.Barkley S. Thompson, Elements of Grace (Marion, AR: Trinity Books, 2013). In addition to his pastorally oriented works, Thompson has published academic essays focusing on figures as diverse as the 19th-century philosopher Josiah Royce and the contemporary agrarian writer Wendell Berry.Barkley Thompson, ‚ÄúToward a Christology of Purpose: The Early Royce and the Incarnation,‚Äù American Journal of Theology and Philosophy 21:1 (2000): 39-57.Barkley Thompson, ‚ÄúEschatological Moments in the Theology of Josiah Royce and the Novels of Wendell Berry‚Äù. Journal of Pastoral Theology 15:1 (2005): 39-47. =Ecclesiastical politics= The early years of Thompson's career coincided with a tumultuous time in the Episcopal Church, as tensions around human sexuality led to internal fractures in the denomination that spilled over into the Episcopal Church's relationships with other churches of the Anglican Communion. In response to the trend of individual parishes and dioceses separating themselves from the Episcopal Church, Thompson appealed the historic principle of conciliarism to advocate for a General Council of Anglicanism as the proper arena in which to adjudicate ecclesiastical disputes.Barkley Thompson, \\"Conciliar Authority\\", The Living Church 229:21 (November 2004): 12-13. For Anglicans, according to Thompson, such a council should be in the form of a Lambeth Conference that would have juridical power. Thompson has also disputed the practice of Anglican bishops foreign to the United States asserting episcopal supervision over Anglican/Episcopal bodies within US geographical boundaries. He has advocated that the fundamentally provincial character of Anglican polity ought to dictate that the various churches of the Anglican Communion respect one another's autonomy and independence.Barkley Thompson, ‚ÄúAnglican Essentials from the Reformation‚Äù, The Living Church 235:8 (August 2007): 15-16. This attitude, in Thompson's view, would be in conformity with the spirit of the Act in Restraint of Appeals, one of the foundational parliamentary acts of the English Reformation. Thompson has referred to the ideals contained in the Act in Restraint of Appeals the ‚ÄúFirst Principle of Anglicanism‚Äù.Thompson, ‚ÄúAnglican Essentials from the Reformation‚Äù, The Living Church 235:8 (August 2007): 16.

George Wilson Life Born at Hathersage, Derbyshire, on 24 April 1808, he was the son of John Wilson, a corn miller, who moved in 1819 to Manchester, as a corn merchant. He was educated at the Manchester commercial school and at evening classes, and was at one time a pupil of John Dalton. Wilson started business in the corn trade, and then became a starch and gum manufacturer. Most of his working life was taken up with political and railway work. He was, when young, president of the Manchester Phrenological Society, and an occasional writer for the press. He was secretary to the committee which obtained the charter of incorporation for Manchester in 1839, and sat as a member of the town council from 1841 to 1844. On the foundation of the Anti-Cornlaw Association in January 1839, he became a member of the executive committee, and in 1841, when the title was changed to that of the Anti-Cornlaw League, he was elected chairman, and occupied that position until the repeal of the corn laws, of February 1846. During those five years Wilson presided over the largest British public meetings held up to that time, to agitate constitutionally for a change in the law. When the League was dissolved, its council of presented him with ¬£10,000 in recognition of his political work. The great bazaars in aid of the cause in Manchester and London were due to him. In 1852, when Lord Derby's government proposed to reimpose a \\"moderate\\" duty on corn, the League, revived under Wilson's guidance, disposed of the protectionist proposal in a short campaign. He subsequently turned his attention to parliamentary reform, particularly to redistribution of seats. He kept the question in the front at the numerous public meetings and reform conferences at which he presided, became chairman of the Lancashire Reformers' Union in 1858, and in 1864 was appointed president of the National Reform Union. He took an active part in the Union for the rest of his life. Wilson was often asked to stand for parliament, but never did. He was as director of the Electric Telegraph Company, and with Joseph Adshead he established the Manchester Night Asylum. In 1847 he joined the board of directors of the Manchester and Leeds Railway, and was deputy- chairman in 1848. In 1860 he became managing director and deputy-chairman of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company. In 1867 he was appointed chairman. Wilson died suddenly on 29 December 1870 on a train, and was interred in Ardwick cemetery, Manchester. He attended a Sandemanian chapel, but was tolerant in his religious views. Family Wilson married, in 1837, Mary, daughter of John Rawson, merchant and manufacturer, of Manchester, by whom he had seven children.

Depicting Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette with George Washington, and designed by Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber, it was the only U.S. silver dollar commemorative prior to 1983, and the first U.S. coin to depict American citizens. Beginning in 1898, prominent Americans sought to erect in Paris a monument to Lafayette, a Frenchman who fought in the American Revolutionary War. Among these supporters was Chicago businessman Ferdinand Peck, whom President William McKinley chose as commissioner-general to the exposition. Peck made the monument proposal a part of the American plans for Paris, and appointed the Lafayette Memorial Commission to raise funds for it. A part of this fundraising was the one- dollar commemorative coin, approved by Congress on March 3, 1899. Conjoined busts of Washington and Lafayette appear on the obverse. Barber stated that the bases for his work were a sculpture of Washington by Jean-Antoine Houdon, and an 1824 medal of Lafayette by Fran√ßois-Augustin Caunois. For the reverse, he used an early sketch of the planned monument, designed by Paul Wayland Bartlett, whose last name appears on the base of the statue on the reverse. The coins did not sell out, and 14,000 were later melted by the United States Treasury. The Lafayette dollar is valued from several hundred dollars to tens of thousands, depending on condition.  Background  Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette was born on September 6, 1757 to a noble French family. When the boy was less than two years old, his father was killed at the Battle of Minden, making the toddler a wealthy nobleman. The young marquis married in 1774. In 1775, while on military duty in Metz, Lafayette received word of the American Revolution in the Thirteen Colonies. The young officer quickly came to believe that the American cause was noble. On learning that the Second Continental Congress lacked funds, Lafayette hired a ship at his own expense and in 1777 sailed for America, though he initially received a cold reception from the Congress. So many foreign officers had sought to be a part of the Continental Army that its commanding general, George Washington, asked that no more be engaged. Lafayette's application, which sought no pay, met with eventual success. Congress had received a letter from the American envoy to France, Benjamin Franklin, stating that Lafayette's family was wealthy and influential. Franklin urged Congress to accommodate Lafayette, and also keep him safe and out of the action lest his death harm the American cause. Congress dutifully voted in July 1777 to commission Lafayette as a major general, and sent him to meet Washington. The two men formed a very close relationship despite a quarter-century difference in age. Franklin's wish to keep Lafayette safe was frustrated by the young man's desire to be where battles raged, and he was wounded at the Battle of Brandywine in September 1777. France soon entered the war on the American side, and was instrumental in the victory. Lafayette helped lead the decisive Yorktown campaign, leading to the surrender of Lieutenant General Lord Cornwallis alongside his entire army, which sealed the fate of the war in favor of the Americans. Lafayette returned to France after 1781, a national hero in both countries. He returned to the United States in 1784, his last visit for 40 years. In France, he involved himself in politics, favoring a constitutional monarchy. He was given office and commands after the French Revolution, but was captured by the Austrians in 1792, remaining in captivity for five years. After Napoleon arranged his release, Lafayette remained on his estates and away from politics during the Emperor's rule. After the restoration of the monarchy in 1815, he again engaged himself in politics, sitting in the Chamber of Deputies. In 1824, the American Congress voted unanimously to have President James Monroe invite Lafayette to return as the guest of the nation. The marquis and his son, George Washington Lafayette, arrived in New York City to mammoth celebrations. Over the next year and a half, Lafayette visited all 24 states. He was given innumerable honors and gifts, including land in Florida. The marquis returned to France in 1825, and died in 1834. One of only eight people to be made an honorary citizen of the United States, according to Arnie Slabaugh in his book on commemorative coins, \\"Lafayette became so popular and respected in both countries that the friendship he helped cement between the two nations has extended to this day\\".  Inception  In March 1898, a resolution was introduced in Congress for a commission to erect a monument to Lafayette in Paris on behalf of the United States. The bill passed the Senate, and hearings were held before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Chicago businessman and philanthropist Ferdinand Peck testified in support of the bill, which though favored by the committee was not considered by the House due to higher priorities during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Later in 1898, President William McKinley appointed Peck as United States Commissioner- General to the 1900 Exposition Universelle, a World's Fair to be held in Paris, France. Peck revived the Lafayette proposal as part of the American participation in the fair, and created a Lafayette Memorial Commission to supervise the monument project. The commission was to ensure that the monument was unveiled on July 4, 1900‚Äîboth Independence Day and also United States Day at the exposition. On September 1, 1898, Peck appointed a number of prominent Americans to the commission, including Iowa Senator William B. Allison, Secretary of State William R. Day, Archbishop John Ireland, and Reverend Edward Everett Hale. The commission's officers included the treasurer, Comptroller of the Currency (and future Vice President of the United States) Charles G. Dawes, and the secretary, Robert J. Thompson. Fundraising to build the Lafayette monument was a major component of the commission's work, and it sought to involve American schools and schoolchildren in the project. October 19, 1898‚Äîthe 117th anniversary of Cornwallis's surrender at Yorktown‚Äîwas proclaimed the first \\"Lafayette Day\\" by 42 governors or commissioners of education of the states or territories. Although President McKinley did not issue a similar proclamation, he did praise the plan in a letter printed in the press. Special ceremonies in honor of Lafayette (along with appropriate lesson plans) were observed in many schools, and pupils were called upon to donate cents in honor of the French patriot. A total of $45,858.30 was obtained from the events at the schools; those institutions were furnished, on the next Lafayette Day (intended to be annual), with ornate receipts, signed by Dawes and meant as momentos to descend to posterity. Another proposed means of paying for the statue was a commemorative coin. In early 1899, the commission sought enactment of legislation granting it an appropriation of $50,000 in the form of 100,000 commemorative half dollars, that could be sold to the public at a premium. Such a method had helped to finance (though with mixed success) the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Instead, Congress passed and McKinley signed on March 3, 1899, a civil appropriations bill that included provision for 50,000 silver one-dollar pieces to be granted to the commission. The bullion for the striking was to be purchased on the open market and was not to come from the Mint's remaining stocks acquired pursuant to the repealed Sherman Silver Purchase Act, though the Mint would not exhaust its inventory from that legislation until 1904. Congress placed a ceiling on the cost of the silver at $25,000. In the event, the United States Treasury bought 38,675.875 troy ounces of silver for $23,032.80. The designs were to be selected by the Mint Director, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.  Preparation  Mint Director George E. Roberts on his Mint medal designed by Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber Once the bill passed, Bureau of the Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber took personal charge of the project, seeking to avoid the delays and disputes that had marked the two previous commemoratives, the Columbian half dollar and the Isabella quarter. On March 24, 1899, Mint Director George E. Roberts wrote in a letter that the Lafayette Memorial Commission was contemplating having, on one side of the coin, a representation of the new monument. Barber responded the following day to Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Henry Boyer, referencing that letter and asking for a sketch of the monument. By April 12, 1899, the chief engraver had obtained from commission secretary Thompson a preliminary sketch of the monument‚Äîan equestrian statue by Paul Bartlett. Barber sketched other designs, including one with Lafayette's 1784 prayer for the prosperity of the United States. He also created one showing a standing figure of Lafayette, based on a statement by Thompson that they might omit the horse. Barber's concepts showing an equestrian statue for one side, and jugate heads of Lafayette and Washington for the other, would form the basis for the eventual coin. Roberts quickly approved Barber's sketch of the two heads, and without consulting the commission leaked the information to the American Journal of Numismatics, which printed it in its April 1899 issue. On May 23, 1899, Barber wrote to Roberts that he planned to base the Washington bust (on the obverse) on the well-known 1785 bust of the first president by Jean-Antoine Houdon, and upon an early medallic use of the Houdon bust, the 1786 \\"Washington Before Boston\\" medal by Pierre-Simon-Benjamin Duvivier. The Lafayette bust (also on the obverse) was to be based on an 1824 medal of Lafayette by Fran√ßois-Augustin Caunois. Caunois's medal of Lafayette Peck and other commission members were not satisfied with the design proposals, and suggested some of their own. Barber denigrated these in a letter to Roberts on June 8. Peck had proposed that only the faces of Washington and Lafayette be shown, with no depiction of the rest of the head. Barber stated, \\"I am of the opinion that the heads of Washington and Lafayette should be treated from the sculptor's standpoint, and every effort be made to represent them with a grandeur and dignity commensurate with the position they fill in the Nation's history, which certainly could not be done if they are to be shown peeping out of a half moon.\\" At the instructions of Roberts, Barber went to New York and met with Peck over two days on June 14 and 15. Afterwards, Barber reported to the Mint Director, \\"I think we will hear no more of the Lafayette prayer\\" and that Peck now appreciated that the space available for a design, even on a silver dollar (the largest US coin) was limited, \\"and as it is the desire of the Committee [commission] to have the monument displayed, the prayer will have to find some other place\\". Although Barber indicated that the decision of the commission to represent the statue without its pedestal represented progress toward the point where he might engrave dies, \\"I learned in New York that the work of the sculptor must be submitted to a committee in Paris who will have entire charge of the monument, and the sculptor's work has to be changed in any and every detail until it meets the approval of this Committee of Frenchmen ... to me it looks as if it might be sometime in 1900.\\" On June 20, 1899, Barber submitted the final designs for the coin. They were approved by Director Roberts on July 1. This did not put an end to the wrangles over what should be on the coin: the commission wished to have the coins dated 1900, but have them to sell as early as possible in 1899. Secretary of the Treasury Lyman Gage insisted on the provision of the Coinage Act of 1873 that required the date of production to appear on the coins. In the end, the matter was compromised: the pieces were struck in December 1899, not distributed until the following month, and the inscription \\"Paris 1900\\" appears on the coins.  Design  Peter Krider's Yorktown Centennial medal (1881) The obverse of the Lafayette dollar features jugate, or conjoined, heads of Washington and Lafayette. Slabaugh noted Barber's account that the busts were based on the sculpture by Houdon and the medal by Caunois, but, \\"possibly these did have some effect on the design but it has always been my belief that the immediate source or idea for the design was the Yorktown Centennial medal of 1881.\\" Swiatek and Breen contended that although the ultimate ancestor of Barber's depiction of Washington was the Houdon bust, the source of the Lafayette bust and the format of the obverse \\"was beyond doubt Peter L. Krider's Yorktown Centennial Medal (1881)\\". Krider, a Philadelphia engraver not employed by the Mint, issued a number of tokens and medals in the 1870s and 1880s. \\"United States of America\\" and \\"Lafayette Dollar\\" appear at the top and bottom of the obverse of the coin. The reverse is based on an early sketch of the statue of Lafayette by Bartlett. It depicts a mounted statue of Lafayette, riding left. Barber's monogram does not appear on the coin, but the name \\"Bartlett\\" is inscribed on the base of the statue. Also on the base, and extending below it, is a palm branch. The reverse inscription, \\"Erected by the youth of the United States in honor of Gen Lafayette/Paris 1900\\" is a tribute to the school fundraising efforts that took place in 1898. Swiatek and Breen pointed out that even if one grants that the 1900 date was intended to be that of the exposition and the erection of the statue, the coins would still violate the 1873 act, that required the date of mintage to appear on the coins, and thus \\"the Lafayette dollars are technically undated and therefore illegal!\\" The obverse of the \\"Washington Before Boston\\" medal was the first medallic use of Houdon's bust. On the reverse, Lafayette holds a sword, extended upwards. Bartlett described the version of the statue that Barber worked from: \\"Lafayette is represented in the statue as a fact and a symbol, offering his sword and services to the American colonists in the cause of liberty. He appears as the emblem of the aristocratic and enthusiastic sympathy shown by France to our forefathers.\\" Swiatek and Breen noted, \\"We may take Lafayette's pose on the statue, as depicted on the coin, to represent him in triumphal procession rather than charging against the enemy‚Äînote his sheathed sword, like a Highland pipe major's baton, serving as a standard rather than brandished unsheathed as a weapon.\\" Barber's design for the Lafayette dollar has often been criticized. Swiatek and Breen complained about the \\"lifeless head of the President [Washington]\\". Q. David Bowers stated that \\"the shallow relief of Barber's work is but a travesty of Krider's extremely detailed high-relief artistry\\". According to Don Taxay, \\"When one compares Barber's portraits to those by Du Vivier and Caunois, it is clear why [sculptor and Barber enemy] Saint-Gaudens used to refer contemptuously to the 'commercial medalists of the Mint'. The difference here is not merely in the relief, but in elementary modeling skill.\\" Art historian Cornelius Vermeule stated that, \\"the Lafayette dollar lacks the quaint, dated appeal of the Isabella quarter or the amusing originality of the Columbian half-dollar. Despite the necessity for low relief the jugate busts are too linear. The reverse suffers from too much lettering of uniform size. The words 'Paris 1900' might have been enough; at most, the addition of 'From the Youth of the United States' would have conveyed the matter.\\"  Production and aftermath  All Lafayette dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint on December 14, 1899, the centennial of the death of George Washington. The Philadelphia Public Ledger reported, Once the ceremony at the Philadelphia Mint had concluded, striking of the Lafayette dollar continued on an older coinage press capable of minting eighty pieces per minute, or 4,800 per hour. A total of 50,026 pieces were struck, including 26 coins laid aside for inspection and testing at the 1900 meeting of the United States Assay Commission. Casket in which the first Lafayette dollar was presented to French President √âmile Loubet. The first Columbian half dollar had been sold for $10,000. An offer of $5,000 was made but declined for the first Lafayette dollar to be struck, which was designated for presentation to the French president. Thompson, designated a special commissioner of the United States for the purpose, took the casket to France aboard the S.S. La Champagne. The ceremony was originally scheduled for February 22, 1900 (Washington's Birthday), but was not held until March 3, when Thompson presented the casket and coin to French President √âmile Loubet. The two objects are now in the Louvre. The commission was plagued by a number of financial difficulties. In January 1900, sculptor Charles Henry Niehaus questioned why $150,000 was the fundraising target of the commission, as no equestrian statue had ever cost more than half that. The commission was sued by architect Henry Hornbostel, demanding fees for designing a pedestal for Bartlett's statue. The out-of-court settlement reimbursed him for his expenses. Paul Bartlett's statue of Lafayette in Paris The commission was tardy in giving the final order for the statue to Bartlett, so late that it was impossible to have the final bronze piece ready in time; a one-third model was only completed in May. According to Q. David Bowers, \\"the French are at home in such problems.\\" The commission was able to have a full-sized plaster model ready by July 4 by sawing the scale model in pieces and distributing them to various workshops, that made enlargements in plaster. Brought together, the plaster pieces fitted perfectly. This assembly was ceremoniously dedicated in the Place du Carrousel on July 4, 1900. Afterwards, Bartlett was dissatisfied with certain aspects of the design, and changed them. His bronze statue erected there in 1908 differs considerably from the statue depicted on the coin. Changes made included the elimination of Lafayette's three-cornered hat, and the position of the raised arm and sword. The statue stood there for almost eighty years, but was displaced in the 1980s during the excavations for I. M. Pei's glass pyramid at the Louvre. It now stands on Cours-la-Reine in Paris, along the River Seine. Once the coins were minted, the commission began sales at $2 each. After February 1900, when the commission moved its offices from Chicago to Paris, sales were handled by the American Trust & Savings Bank of Chicago. Only small numbers were sold to coin collectors. Sales, conducted through the bank, continued for several years. Prices initially dropped on the secondary market‚Äîthe pieces could be purchased for $1.10 in 1903‚Äîand thousands may have been released into circulation, or were spent by purchasers in hard times. By 1920, the market price passed the original issue price, and thereafter prices rose steadily, reaching $3.50 by 1930, $5 at the height of the commemorative coin boom in July 1936, $13 by 1950, $55 by 1960, and $650 by 1975. Fourteen thousand pieces were returned to the Treasury, and were held in $1,000 sacks. This followed poor sales of the new coin in Paris‚Äîonly 1,800 sold there; some 10,000 were returned to the United States. They were held for many years. In 1945, Omaha coin dealer Aubrey Beebe learned about the coins from government records and enquired, only to be told that the coins had been recently melted. The Lafayette dollar is the first American coin to depict a US citizen. After the Lafayette piece, the Mint did not again strike a commemorative silver dollar until the 1983-S Los Angeles Olympics dollar.  Collecting  In 1925, numismatist George H. Clapp discovered a Lafayette dollar that slightly differed from published descriptions. He researched the matter further over the following decade, and discovered two additional varieties. These exist because multiple dies, for both obverse and reverse, were used in striking the Lafayette piece, and the dies were not identical. Swiatek, writing in 2012, noted a fifth die combination he had discovered, and examined images of hundreds of Lafayette dollars he owned or that were on the Internet. He reported that two varieties combined for more than 90% of the specimens, with the remaining ones much rarer. Because of this, he speculated that the dollars were struck on at least two machines, not one as usually reported, with the rarer varieties the result of replacement dies being inserted as the original ones wore out. The differences are minor (for example, whether the M in \\"America\\" is raised or even with the A that precedes it on the obverse, and details of the palm branch on the reverse) and the coin is rarely collected by die type, meaning that little premium value attaches to the less common varieties. R.S. Yeoman's deluxe edition of A Guide Book of United States Coins issued in 2018 lists the Lafayette dollar at $485 in Almost Uncirculated (AU-50) ranging upwards to $15,000 in near-pristine MS-66. One in MS-67 condition sold in 2015 for $73,438. Most Lafayette dollars display contact marks from other coins as the pieces were mechanically ejected from the press into a hopper and no attempt was made to preserve their appearance for collectors. Although whether the specimen is well-struck or not rarely affects value, clearly struck specimens will show the engraving line separating Lafayette's boot from the rest of his uniform, and details of the lower part of his clothing will also be distinct. The highest points on the coin, at which wear should be most apparent, are Washington's cheekbone on the obverse and the face of Lafayette on the reverse. The coin has been counterfeited from time to time. Various techniques have also been used to make genuine specimens shinier to deceive collectors, including polishing, a process that damages their surfaces and patina.

Her work frequently appeared in shows at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Long Beach Museum of Art, the Los Angeles Art Association, and the Art Center College of Design alongside works by Lorser Feitelson, Helen Lundeberg, Josef Albers, June Wayne, and Knud Merrild, among others.  Early life and education  McCord was born in Dayton, Ohio, on January 30, 1914, but she spent the first year of her life in San Francisco; her father had temporarily relocated there for work. McCord studied at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1932-1934.  Hull House  After graduating in 1934, McCord lived for a short time in Boston, but by 1938 she had returned to Chicago, lured by the city‚Äôs progressive politics and more cosmopolitan art scene. One of the few sites where these forces overlapped was Hull House, the legendary settlement house founded by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jane Addams in 1889 as a place where immigrants of diverse communities could gather to learn, eat, debate, and acquire the tools necessary to put down roots in their adopted country. McCord accepted a job in the Hull House Art Department, where she taught immigrants how to paint and draw, and moved into a garret on the top floor of Addams‚Äô old Victorian mansion. McCord produced her first mature works during her time at Hull House, which lasted until 1945. In the summer of 1938, she created several covers for the Hull House Block News, and also designed a poster, ‚ÄúHalsted Street,‚Äù for the organization. Soon after, she was accepted as an ‚Äúeasel artist‚Äù for the Federal Art Project (FAP), which was the visual arts division of Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs ambitious, Depression-Era Works Progress Administration (WPA).  Career  The WPA stipend enabled McCord to move out of the Hull House and into her own apartment on the north side of Chicago. In 1939, her ‚ÄúCity Scene‚Äù was one of 60 WPA paintings selected for inclusion in the permanent collection of the National Gallery in Washington, D.C. During this period she also exhibited at the Illinois State Museum, and at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1940. At the same time, McCord was making connections through Hull-House that would deepen her engagement with modernism. As a supervisor with the Donald Vestal Puppet Project, a WPA project in which participants made puppets, wrote plays, and performed at Chicago‚Äôs Natural History Museum, McCord came into contact with Donald Vestal, a modern-art gallerist and eventual Gertrude Stein collaborator, and Burr Tillstrom, the celebrated modern puppeteer who went on to create Kulka, Fran and Ollie. McCord also met Frank Lloyd Wright in Chicago, likely through Hull- House, where the renowned modernist architect had delivered his groundbreaking lecture ‚ÄúThe Art and Craft of the Machine‚Äù in 1901 and with which he had a lasting relationship. (Wright‚Äôs mother and uncle were both Hull-House volunteers ). McCord‚Äôs association with Wright sparked a lifelong fascination with architecture. When she was later asked to name her favorite artists, McCord said there were only three to whom she ‚Äúresponded with feeling‚Äù: ‚ÄúCezanne, Claude Lorrain, and Frank Lloyd Wright.‚Äù  California  By 1945, McCord‚Äôs parents and three younger brothers had all moved to California, and when the war ended, she followed them west, settling in Venice Beach, where she quickly integrated herself into the local bohemian community. McCord‚Äôs paintings were greeted with widespread acclaim, frequently appearing in shows at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Long Beach Museum of Art, the Los Angeles Art Association, and the Art Center School of Design alongside works by Lorser Feitelson, Helen Lundeberg, Josef Albers, June Wayne, and Knud Merrild, among others. In 1951, McCord married Lou Newman. Her work was featured in LACMA‚Äôs cutting-edge exhibition Painting in the USA; the same year she participated in Six Portable Murals, a group show organized by the Los Angeles Art Association that advertised itself as a collection of paintings ‚Äúdesigned especially for mid-century architecture.‚Äù ‚ÄúPainting,‚Äù a large McCord abstraction acquired by June Wayne and prominently displayed in Wayne‚Äôs Alvin Lustig-designed home, appeared on the cover of the Nov. 11, 1951 issue of The Los Angeles Times Home magazine in a color photograph by Julius Shulman. Leading architectural critic Esther McCoy wrote the accompanying article. Although McCord continued to exhibit locally and paint at her Venice Beach studio‚Äîand although her works were acquired by significant collectors (Alice Parker Henderson, Maurice Weiss, Lorser Feitelson) and major museums, including the Long Beach Museum of Art‚Äîshe was largely overlooked after the 1950s. But in 2011 the seeds of a McCord revival were planted when her Big Pink (1951) was the only painting chosen to appear in \\"Living in a Modern Way,\\" LACMA‚Äôs sweeping survey of mid-century California design. McCord died at her home in Venice Beach on April 18, 2008.  Critical reception  Writing in East of Borneo about McCord's contribution to the 1951 exhibition \\"Six Portable Murals\\" at the Los Angeles Art Association, critic Jonathan Griffin described McCord as \\"an accomplished colourist\\" who was \\"an innovator long before the term 'Hard Edge' was coined in 1959, and before the expressionist Richard Diebenkorn became associated with the Ocean Park area of Santa Monica when he moved there in 1966.\\" Griffin went on to suggest that the reason McCord \\"has not enjoyed the exposure, until now, of her male peers\\" likely reflects \\"the prejudice that female artists faced in mid-century California, relegated to making d√©cor rather than progressive artistic experiments.\\" In an Artillery magazine review of McCord's 2013-2014 retrospective Elizabeth McCord Paintings at See Line Gallery in Los Angeles, Peter Frank wrote that \\"the palette McCord maintained throughout her career, brimming with dark tones but bright chromas, seems deliberately designed to convey a sense of light and atmosphere, most specifically that of Southern California‚Äôs Mediterranean climate,\\" adding that \\"her exercises in sensuous or subdued palette all have a compositional soundness to them.\\" Frank concluded that \\"McCord‚Äôs particular take on such 'concrete expressionism' ... was sprightly and distinctive ... fusing the brio of gestural abstraction with the luminous qualities and almost heraldic designs of hard-edge painting.\\" In 2014, Kyle Fitzpatrick of Los Angeles, I'm Yours characterized Soft Color, a McCord exhibition at LA's The Landing gallery, as \\"an incredible collection of work.\\" ReferencesExternal links * \\"ElizabethMcCord.net\\" * Bannatyne, Bryce. \\"E.

The stream passes centrally through the Governor Bridge Natural Area / Patuxent River Park and joins the Patuxent, just south of Governor's Bridge. The stream cuts a narrow gorge through the Aquia greensand between Crain Highway and its junction with the Patuxent. Drainage area Green Branch drains the communities of Heather Hills, Ensleigh, Essington, Easthaven, Heather Ridge, Palisades, Pin Oak Village, Covington Manor, Governors Green and Longlea as well as the commercial areas of Bowie Gateway Center and Prince George's Stadium within Bowie, Maryland. Environmental concerns The major pollutant in this stream is non-point sediment. The source of the sediment is erosion from construction, storm water runoff carrying lawn chemicals such as excess fertilizer, and pet waste runoff from lawns. Increased amount of runoff causes water to flow at a faster rate, which erodes stream banks and increases sediment in the water. A large culvert on Green Branch, was significantly impairing fish passage to spawning grounds upstream on the Patuxent in 2008. Fish including herring, alewife, and American eel could not pass through the three-pipe culvert located under an access road within the Governor Bridge Natural Area. The Patuxent Riverkeeper has been working with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Fish Passage Program to fix this and has received funding from Fish America Foundation and Chesapeake Bay Trust to support the project.

News comments On February 11, 2019, on religious grounds, Kavanagh made belittling comments following a humanist invocation made by Rep. Athena Salman on the floor of the Arizona House of Representatives. Salman lodged a protest on the House floor the following day, citing the multiple House and federal rules Kavanagh had violated with his remarks. Kavanagh made news by passing a bill to end abusive lawsuits against businesses for minor violations of Arizona's American's With Disabilities Act. Kavanagh's bill gives businesses a \\"cure period\\" during which they can correct violations and avoid litigation. Kavanagh passed legislation granting those who break into locked vehicles to rescue children and pets from overheating on hot days immunity from civil liability and lawsuits. In 2016, Kavanagh passed a law mandating that doctors check the Controlled Substance Prescription Monitoring Program (CSPMP) database before prescribing a controlled substance to a patient, in response to doctor shopping by opioid abusers. Kavanagh made news for his controversial comment on inmate Regan Clarine being asked to treat her C-section with sugar. He reportedly commented \\"That doesn't sound like a true allegation. That sounds ridiculous. Prisoners have 24/7 to think of allegations and write letters. I'm not saying that some of them can't have a basis in fact, but you gotta take them with a grain of salt, or, in the case of the hospital, maybe a grain of sugar.\\"Abigail Leonard and Adam May (May 28, 2014). Whistleblower: Arizona inmates are dying from inadequate health care. America Tonight. Retrieved December 30, 2014. Kavanagh was the lead sponsor of a bill to remove eleven controversial phrases from Arizona's controversial 9/11 Memorial. As a retired Port Authority police officer, Kavanagh was upset by the controversial phrases because he personally knew many of the 37 Port Authority police officers who died at the World Trade Center on September 11. One of the phrases involved the name of Balbir Singh Sodhi, a victim of a racist retaliatory attack in Arizona after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Claiming that Sodhi, who was murdered four days after the attacks by a white supremacist seeking revenge for the 9/11 attacks, he said Sodhi was \\"not a victim of 9/11,\\" Kavanagh further stated \\"It's part of a myth that, following 9/11, Americans went into a xenophobic rage against foreigners. That's not true. America's reaction towards foreigners was commendable.\\" The bill passed, but was vetoed and did not take effect. Kavanagh did meet with Sodhi's family, recognized his error in proposing to remove Sodhi's name and had agreed to keep his name on the memorial. Kavanagh sponsored a bill to make it illegal to record the police within twenty feet, even of ones own interaction with them. Another bill he sponsored would have prevented municipalities from requiring private businesses to allow transgender people to use restrooms that match their gender identities.

He was selected in the sixth round (137th overall) of the 1970 NFL Draft by the Cincinnati Bengals. He played in only one game in his rookie year of 1970, the Bengals' first year in the NFL after the AFL-NFL merger. In 1971, however, he saw significant playing time at free safety, playing in all 14 games with four interceptions returned for a total of 46 yards. He also returned six punts for 14 yards and even rushed once for seven yards. In 1973, he joined the New England Patriots and started in all of the Patriots' 14 games, picking off three passes. He also returned three punts for 21 yards. The following year, 1974, was his fourth and final NFL season, as Durko played 11 games and started four for the Patriots. In 2011, he was one of 12 honorees inducted into the West Covina Walk of Fame, which \\"honors athletes, coaches and sports volunteers from the city who have made significant contributions in making West Covina a better place to live, work and play.

This conflict was part of the South American theater in the Cold War, with the United States backing the Chilean military and the Soviet Union backing the guerrillas. The main armed resistance groups of the period were the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR) and Frente Patri√≥tico Manuel Rodr√≠guez (FPMR), the armed wing of the Communist Party of Chile. These groups had a long-standing rivalry, including over Marxist orthodoxy. Key events during the armed resistance were the attempt to set up guerrilla camps in Neltume in 1970-73\\"In September 1973 and again in September 1981, the forest complex of Panguipulli (especially Neltume), only 115 kilometres east of Valdivia, became the focal point of alleged subversive attacks and shoot-outs and a site of massive military operations leading to executions. Panguipulli indeed served as a zone of political organizing, land invasion, and agrarian reform during 1970-73, and as a camping zone for MIRistas reentering Chile under Operacion Retorno in 1980-81.\\" Battling for Hearts and Minds, Steve J. Stern, p. 288, Duke University Press and 1980-81, the February 1986 sabotaging of the Limache train tracks, the Carrizal Bajo arms smuggling operation in August 1986 and the attempted killing of Pinochet in September that same year. After the return to democracy was initiated in 1990 the bulk of the armed groups demobilized. However, splinter groups that reportedly switched targets after the dictatorship fell, continued to carry out assassinations, bombings, kidnappings and armed robberies until 2010. The insurgency was supported by the socialist states of Cuba, Libya, Nicaragua and North Korea (the Warsaw Pact states provided minor financial assistance), while the Chilean security forces were backed by the United States, Britain and Israel.Hudson, Rex. \\"Coordinating Cuba's Support for Marxist-Leninist Violence in the Americas.\\" Cuban American National Foundation, 1988: \\"A State Department official confirmed that U.S. experts had positively established that Cuba sent the weapons. (248) According to Chilean officials, more than 200 individuals participated in transferring the weapons from Soviet and Cuban merchant or fishing ships into chartered Chilean fishing boats, and then in carrying them ashore in rubber dinghies (Zodiacs). (249) Chilean authorities also reported that Cuba, Nicaragua and the Soviet Union provided $20 million through an International Guerrilla Coordinating Committee (CCGI) to finance the landing of weapons and explosives in the northern zone of Chile and the subsequent failed assassination attempt made by the FPMR against General Pinochet. In that action on September 7, 1986, fifteen FPMR terrorists attacked the General's motorcade with grenades and automatic weapons, killing five members of the presidential guard and wounding ten military escorts. (250) According to Chile's director general of Investigative Police, both the FPMR and MIR receive urban guerrilla training in Cuba at the Punto Cero, Pinar del Rio, Trinidad, and Havana camps. The official added that Cuba provides logistical support, whereas the Soviet Union gives them financial and propaganda assistance, and other aid comes from Nicaragua and Libya. (251) Chile's Attorney General Ambrosio Rodr√≠guez reported on January 22, 1988 that Cuban and Nicaraguan agents were commanding a newly created International Guerrilla Coordinating Board (presumably the CCGI) that had politically reunited the MIR and FPMR under Cuban command. He added that MIR and FPMR cadres were being trained in Cuba and East Germany.(252)\\" Pre-dictatorship violence The first major action by the MIR took place in September 1967 during violent clashes between MIR-led students from the University of Concepci√≥n and riot police. Carabineros were seeking to arrest those responsible for destroying a police vehicle, but students reorganized and kidnapped carabinier H√©ctor Guti√©rrez Orellana. Chilean president Eduardo Nicanor Frei Montalva sought to defuse the situation through intermediaries and obtained the release of the policeman in exchange for dropping charges against students earlier arrested in the confrontations.Determinants of Gross Human Rights Violations by State and State Sponsored Actors in Brazil, Uruguay, Chile and Argentina: 1960 - 1990, Wolfgang S. Heinz, Hugo Fr√ºhling, p. 423, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1999 During 1968, the MIR presence continued to be felt in various universities with armed actions increasing in 1969 through multiple acts of vandalism, intimidation and physical assaults on conservative/right wing students and faculty members. On 1 May 1969, fifteen MIR activists armed with knives took over the Bio Bio radio station in Concepci√≥n and transmitted a special broadcast calling for the locals to take up arms and overthrow the government of Frei. On 2 May 1969, MIR activists operating in Concepci√≥n attacked the branches of National City Bank, the building of the La Patria newspaper and the offices of the Weigner Stein business. In June, the MIR kidnapped journalist Hern√°n Osses Santa Mar√≠a, Director of the Noticias de la Tarde in nearby Talcahuano (15.6 kilometres), in an effort to silence the in depth reporting on the leftist violence in Concepci√≥n. Police Investigations and Carabineros soon surrounded the University of Concepci√≥n and forced the students to release the newspaper director unharmed. A specially appointed judge was soon named and a criminal suit was filed with the Courts of Appeals of Concepci√≥n against the MIR and over 20 of its identified leaders for breaking the Law of Interior Security of the State. Consequently, the MIR had no option but to go largely underground and into hiding. In the ensuing police and military operations against the MIR, a guerrilla training camp is discovered in San Jos√© de Maipo (Guayac√°n) and another at Corral (Chaihu√≠n).\\"En 1969 se descubre una escuela de guerrilleros en San Jos√© de Maipo (Guayac√°n) y en 1970 otra en Corral (Chaihu√≠n).\\" R√©gimen de Gobierno y Partidos Pol√≠ticos en Chile 1924-1973, Bernardino Bravo Lira, p. 301, Editorial Jur√≠dica de Chile, 1986 Nevertheless, MIR guerrillas continue to operate, and in Santiago alone carry out 12 armed robberies of banks and businesses between August 1969 and September 1970 to finance their operations.\\"Entre agosto de ese a√±o y septiembre siguiente realiza en Santiago no menos de 12 asaltos a mano armada contra Bancos y locales comerciales.\\" R√©gimen de Gobierno y Partidos Pol√≠ticos en Chile 1924-1973, Bernardino Bravo Lira, p. 301, Editorial Jur√≠dica de Chile, 1986 The Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR) were absolved of criminal charges under an amnesty under the Popular Unity (Unidad Popular or UP) government of Allende and was allowed to operate again openly, encouraging and carrying out illegal expropriations of farms and businesses, and assaulting outspoken conservatives/rightist members of the public and security forces.

Some of them had commando-training, having belonged to the GAP (Grupo de Amigos Personales), they had previously served as bodyguards of President Allende. Many activists created resistance groups from refugees abroad. The Movimiento Juvenil Lautaro or Lautaro Youth Movement (MJL) was formed in December 1982 and the Communist Party of Chile set up an armed wing, which became in 1983 the FPMR (Frente Patri√≥tico Manuel Rodr√≠guez). The main guerrilla group, known as the MIR (Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria), suffered heavy casualties in the coup's immediate aftermath, and most of its members fled the country.Terrorism Review Chile: Change in MIR tactics Andreas Pascal Allende, a nephew of President Allende led the MIR from 1974‚Äì1976, then made his way to Cuba. Nevertheless, in the first three months of military rule, the Chilean forces recorded 162 military deaths. It is claimed that a total of 756 servicemen and police are reported to have been killed or wounded in clashes with guerrillas in the 1970s. Among the killed and disappeared during the military regime were at least 663 Marxist MIR guerrillas.CAIDOS DEL MIR EN DIFERENTE PERIODOS. CEME (CENTRO DE ESTUDIOS MIGUEL ENRIQUEZ). The MIR commander, Andr√©s Pascal Allende, has admitted that the Marxist guerrillas lost 1,500-2,000 fighters killed or disappeared. Many guerrillas confessed under torture and several hundred other young men and women, sympathetic to the guerrillas, were detained and tortured and often killed. Nearly 700 civilians disappeared in the 1974-1977 period, after being detained by the Chilean military and police. Remnants of the MIR also joined Marxist guerrillas from the People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina) (Ej√©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo or ERP) in Argentina in the protracted fight to control Tucum√°n Province. Some 30,000 former Chilean conscripts that served between 1973 and 1990, claiming to be suffering from post-traumatic stress after taking part in the cordon and search operations and night curfews, are currently seeking compensation from the Chilean government. Fewer than 60 individuals died as a direct result of fighting on 11 September although the MIR and GAP continued to fight the following day. In all, 46 of Allende's elite guard (the GAP, Grupo de Amigos Personales) were killed, some of them in combat with the soldiers that took the Moneda. Allende's Cuban-trained guard would have had about 300 elite commando-trained GAP fighters at the time of the coup,The Nixon Administration and the Death of Allende's Chile: A Case of Assisted Suicide, Jonathan Haslam, page 64, Verso Press 2005 but the use of brute military force, especially the use of Hawker Hunters fighter-bombers, may have handicapped many GAP fighters from further action. On the military side, there were 34 deaths: two army sergeants, three army corporals, four army privates, 2 navy lieutenants, 1 navy corporal, 4 naval cadets, 3 navy conscripts and 15 carabineros. Most of the carabineros were killed after two busloads of policemen were heavily engaged by armed leftists in the Pro- Allende shantytown of La Ligua.The Dictator's Shadow: Life Under Augusto Pinochet, Heraldo Mu√±oz, p. 19, Basic Books, 2008 In mid-September, the Chilean military junta claimed its troops suffered another 16 dead and 100 injured by gunfire in mop-up operations against Allende supporters, and Pinochet warned, \\"sadly there are still some armed groups who insist on attacking, which means that the military rules of wartime apply to them.\\" 22-year-old Corporal Hugo Y√°√±ez Dur√°n would be among the army fallen, killed on 15 September 1973 in a shootout with leftists students holding out in the grounds of the University of Chile.La Verdad Olvidada del Terrorismo en Chile, 1968-1996, Arturo Castillo Vicencio, p. 87, Editorial Maye Ltda, 2007 On 23 October 1973, 23-year-old Army Corporal Benjam√≠n Alfredo Jaramillo Ruz, who was serving with the Cazadores, became the first fatal casualty of the counterinsurgency operations in the mountainous area of Alquihue in Valdivia after being shot by a sniper.Informe de la Comisi√≥n Nacional de Verdad y Reconciliaci√≥n, Volume I, Page 441, Santiago, Chile, 1991.

By the end of the year, the Chilean police would claim to have uncovered a huge arms cache, that included 5,000 HK-33 sub-machineguns and corresponding ammunition numbering in the millions and large quantities of 20-mm anti-tank gun shells.Victoria sin guerra, Graf Hans Huyn, p. 280, Andres Bello, 1987 1974‚Äì1979 On 19 February 1975, four captured MIR commanders went on national television to urge their guerrillas to lay down their arms. According to them, the MIR leadership was in ruins: of the 52 commanders of the MIR, nine had been killed, 24 were prisoners, ten were in exile, one had been expelled from the group, and eight were still at large. On 18 November 1975, MIR guerrillas killed a 19-year-old army conscript (Private Hern√°n Patricio Salinas Calder√≥n).Informe Rettig. Volume II. Page 605.

(SM, V, Chro) The Chilean secret police on this occasion were met with a hail of automatic weapons fire, killing a carabinero and a girl. On 28 April 1976, MIR guerrillas shot and killed a 29-year-old carabineros corporal (Bernardo Arturo Alcayaga Cerda) while he was walking home in the Santiago suburb of Pudahuel. On 16 October 1977, MIR guerrillas exploded 10 bombs in Santiago. In 1978 the MIR sought to reestablish a guerrilla front in southern Chile and launched Operation Return which involved clandestine entry, recruitment, bombings and bank robberies in Santiago that briefly shook the military regime. In February 1979 MIR guerrillas bombed the US-Chile Cultural Institute in Santiago, causing considerable damage. In 1979, about 40 bombings were blamed on MIR guerrillas. Several police, military and civilians caught in the crossfire and bomb blasts were killed in the renewed MIR attacks in the Chilean capital and at least 70 soldiers and policemen were wounded battling the marxist guerrillas.\\"La √∫ltima v√≠ctima fue un sargento de Carabineros. Y m√°s o menos 70 quedaron heridos en combate\\" Los Comunistas y la Democracia, Luis Corval√°n, p. 49, Lom Ediciones, 2008 Neltume Guerrilla Front In order to reinforce urban guerrilla warfare waged in the main cities, the MIR commanders in 1978 had set in motion Operaci√≥n Retorno (Operation Return), ordering exiled militants back into Chile. In 1980, a platoon of thirty well-equipped MIR combatants of the Toqui Lautaro Battalion infiltrated into the mountains of Neltume in southern Chile and reestablished a guerrilla front. The MIR spearhead was commanded by 30-year-old Miguel Cabrera Fern√°ndez (nome de guerre Paine), who along with 120-150 Chileans had completed their training for this operation in Czechoslovakia, Cuba and North Korea.Neltume 81 (Chilean TV documentary), 2012 The Chilean Army moved against the guerrillas in Neltume in June 1981, in a massive operation spearheaded by the Chilean Para-Commandos (elite Black Berets) all under the command of Colonel Orlando Basauri, with support from 10 Puma and Lama helicopters. Flora Jaramillo had fed and attended three MIR guerrillas that had sought refuge in her house, and not wanting to be later accused of collaborating with the enemy had sent her 15-year-old son Juan Carlos Henr√≠quez Jaramillo to warn the local police station. Carabineros soon surrounded her house and opened fire, killing all the guerrillas and destroying the house, but not before warning Mrs Jaramillo to get out. The Special Forces involved discovered the first guerrilla arms cache on 25 June killing Ra√∫l Rodrigo Obreg√≥n Torres (nome de guerre Pablo) in the process, and four more store dumps were uncovered by the end of the first week in July. Another gun-battle took place on 28 June, but it took some time before Basauri's men could corner the guerrilla force.Chile Under Pinochet, Mark Ensalaco, p. 146, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010 Nevertheless, seven MIR guerrillas were reported killed in an ambush in the third week of September, just after the 8th-anniversary of the 1973 military coup, but the survivors were able to escape and blend in with the local population. On 19 September 1981, Army Private Victor Manuel Nahuelpan Silva is killed during operations in Neltume. On 16 October 1981, Juan Angel Ojeda Aguayo (nom de guerre Pequeco) who had escaped the mountain fighting was caught and executed while resting at his parents‚Äô home. Miguel Cabrera Fern√°ndez was himself killed on 15 October 1981, in a clash with policemen at Choshuenco. The Pinochet regime launched another counterinsurgency operation in August 1984 to wipe out the remaining guerrillas, concentrating in the areas around Concepci√≥n, Valdivia and Los Angeles, killing seven more MIR fighters and forcing the remainder to go into permanent hiding. Some forty MIR fighters lost their lives between 1978 (when Operation Return was set in motion) and 1984 when the MIR insurgency was finally defeated in southern Chile. Another 41 supporting Mapuche Indians that had earlier on taken part in the land and business takeovers under Salvador Allende were killed with 80 only spared after having been rounded up in and around Neltume and held for long periods in secret detention camps.\\"En los informes sobre derechos humanos se establece que en este per√≠odo hubo 41 ejecutados pol√≠ticos y m√°s de 80 detenidos desaparecidos de origen mapuche.\\" Los Comunistas y la Democracia, Luis Corval√°n, p. 74, Lom Ediciones, 2008 Guillermina Reinante, had three brothers rounded up and forcibly disappeared up by soldiers from the 8th Tucapel Infantry Regiment in late 1973. When she enquired about their whereabouts a female military official informed her that they had been executed. In the 2012 Chilean TV documentary Neltume 81 Reinante claimed that the military had executed her brothers in revenge for taking part in the land expropriations. 1980‚Äì1989 Peaceful protest against Pinochet, 1985 On 15 July 1980, three guerrillas in blue overalls and yellow hardhats ambushed the car of Lieutenant-Colonel Roger Vergara Campos, director of the Chilean Army Intelligence School, and killed him and wounded his driver in a barrage of bullets from AK-47 assault rifles.

Pellegrino also negotiated the sale of the International Hat Company to Interco, Inc. Additionally, he created a variety of inventions related to the plastic molding industry. Most notably, Pellegrino invented automated assembly line machines in the formation of plastic objects. These machines were used by General Fibre in the production of a variety of plastic models, duck decoys, and Michelob paraphernalia throughout the 1960s to 1980s.

After World War II, Pellegrino was stationed in Japan as part of the US occupation and rebuilding effort. In 1948, he returned to St. Louis and married into the high society, old money Henry family; marrying Virginia Anne Henry, daughter of Harry W. Henry, president of the Graham Paper Company. That same year, Pellegrino was hired as vice president of General Fibre by President George Tilles, Jr. In the mid-1950s, Pellegrino became president of General Fiber, following the retirement of Lewis Tilles Apple. The company had manufactured the original M1 fiber helmet liner in 1941 before moving into the production of fiber components for the military pressed fiber sun helmets used by American soldiers during World War II. After the war ended, the company required a production transition back to civilian orders. In 1946, General Fibre switched into the duck, goose, and swan decoy model market. The models were used by hunters to attract prey. During his management of the company, General Fiber reached its peak production of these models in the late 1950s and early 1960s. However, it was during this time that Pellegrino began shifting the company's business model out of the production of wood fiber pulp products into the emerging plastics and plastic molding industry. In the early 1960s, he designed and engineered new automated machines in the manufacturing of plastic goods. These included plastic models, construction helmets, and various products for the Anheuser-Busch company. Pellegrino died in 2008. He is buried in Sunset Memorial Park in St. Louis.

History  The mosque was constructed between 1747 and 1751 by the order of Qudsia Begum for Nawab Bahadur Javed Khan, a nobleman during the reign of the Emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur. Qudsia Begum was the mother of Emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur. Javed Khan was the supervisor of the harem and was in great favour with the begum and therefore was very influential. He was later assassinated. The Sunehri Masjid is made of bassee jung, a light salmon-coloured stone not usually used for building mosques, which gives the building a singular and picturesque appearance. Nawab Ahmad Bakhsh Khan, father of the Nawab of Firozpur, repaired the mosque to benefit the neighbourhood. Not long after its renovation, Nawab Ahmad Bakhsh Khan was attacked by an infuriated elephant while out with his son. His horse was killed in the attack, and his vehicle was destroyed. The Nawab and his son were only saved from death by taking refuge inside this mosque.  Architecture  The mosque is surmounted by three domes, which were originally gilt with copper from which it derives its name. The mosque has a main prayer hall and two minarets. The central arch of the mosque bears an inscription about the builder of the mosque and date of its construction.

It tells the story of a Christmas obsessed Jewish boy on his way to sunny Florida who figures out how to get the Christmas of his dreams by trading airline tickets and places with another boy on his way to snowy Christmastown, Washington. This film also features CGI scenes based on Ira's Christmas dreams. It stars Elliott Gould and David DeLuise and is directed and produced by Sue Corcoran. It was originally filmed, in Leavenworth, Washington, under the title Ira Finkelstein's Christmas. At a local screening in 2012 it had the title All I want is Christmas. The film was included in the 2012 Seattle International Film Festival. Plot In Hollywood, Ira J. Finkelstein (Elijah Nelson) wishes he could celebrate Christmas, but his parents do not want to celebrate because they are Jewish. Ira's father, Max (David DeLuise), a filmmaker, says he's making a low-budget, holiday sci-fi movie and that he wants demanding and empty-headed Jennifer Cameo (Julianne Christie) to be the lead role. Ira's mother, Rosie (Angela DiMarco), a caterer, gets to plan a Christmas party. Ira's parents tell him that he is going to visit his grandparents, Sam (Elliott Gould) and Ruth Finkelstein (Meg Savlov) in Florida for Hanukkah and that he'll have fun with them. Ira further contends that he wants to go somewhere where it snows so that he can experience an authentic Christmas. Ira's flight lands at the Chicago O'Hare International Airport and he is excited to see snow for the first time in real life. At an indoor kids' area he reluctantly goes over to the play area where he meets a Christian boy named Mikey Amato (Justin Howell). Mikey tells Ira that he is from Chicago and is visiting his aunt, uncle, and cousins in Washington, relatives that he hardly knows; he only knows their names and what they look like by a postcard his mom, Julie (Tracy Hyland), gave him. He also thinks it's awesome how Jews get eight nights of presents for Hanukkah. Ira tells him that he'd rather go to a place like Washington to experience Christmas. They agree to switch places, donning each other's hats, coats, and ID tags as well as Ira‚Äôs glasses but the 2 boys barely pull it off due to Ira‚Äôs bad eye prescription...with no airport security-guard suspecting anything different about them. Ira and Mikey exchange phone numbers and while Mikey gives Ira the postcard of his cousins. Ira arrives at the Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport and is greeted by Mikey's relatives, Libby (Cynthia Geary) and Walt (Tony Doupe) Wilson and their three children, Jessica (Jenna Levin), Clare (Shayne Hodgins), and Kyle (Jack Fleischmann). Meanwhile, Mikey arrives in Florida and is affectionately greeted by Ira's grandparents. Neither set of relatives suspects anything is wrong since Mikey and Ira look alike, nor have they seen them since they were both much younger. The Wilsons take their \\"cousin\\" to Christmastown, Washington, where they live. Ira is excited because the town is \\"just like in the movies\\". He is also inspired to make and direct a play called Christmas Is For Everyone. Jessica and a friend sing and play guitar on the street for money, and Clare can sing but doesn't want to do it in public. She writes a song for the play, and Jessica and her friend agree to perform in the play. Clare and Ira round up kids from town to audition. Jack, a bully, sics his dog Killer on Ira, who climbs a tree to escape the dog. Eventually, Ira realizes he misses his family. After Jack's father threatens to send Killer to the pound, Clare and Ira rescue Killer, renamed Mistletoe, and put him in the play. Mikey gets injured from a broken-arm, and when Ira's parents are called, they drop everything to rush to his side...discovering that he and Ira had switched places; Jennifer was becoming too difficult to work with and wasn't talented anyway. The truth eventually comes out to everyone but Ira's family go to Washington to surprise him on the night of the play. Mikey's family also finds out the truth, and Mikey is pleased to see his mother, who came to surprise him as well. As the play comes to an end, Ira‚Äôs parents reconcile with him and tell him that they‚Äôre very proud of what‚Äôs he‚Äôs done. Soon everyone gathers for the final song: ‚ÄúChristmas Is For Everyone‚Äù and everyone embraces each other by learning the true meaning of family and the holidays.

It is required for every type of motorised vehicle with the exception of the smallest mopeds below 50 cm¬≥, with a speed limit of 25 km/h, as well as motorised bicycles. (Even for these, there is a minimum age of 15 years and a small mandatory driving school course). The types of licences one may obtain are the same in all the European Economic Area. See European driving licence. The minimum age to obtain a driving licence is: 16 years for a restricted motorcycle up to 125 cm¬≥, 17 years for a car with a legal guardian, 18 years for unrestricted car and 21 years for buses and cargo vehicles.Bundesministerium f√ºr Verkehr und digitale Infrastruktur, http://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/LA/voraussetzungen-fuer-die- fahrerlaubnis-und-geltungsdauer.html Obtaining a driving licence The German driving licence can be obtained after finishing driving school and passing a two-stage test, the theory test and road test. Before being allowed to take these tests an eye-exam must have been performed and a first-aid course (usually lasts 8 hours) completed. The learner driver's training usually takes place in legally authorised and mostly privately-owned, for- profit driving schools. The driving school handles all the necessary paperwork for the students, such as: applying for a licence, registering for tests etc. The theoretical part of the education comprises of lessons at the driving school, held by legally authorised driving instructors, typically in the evening. The content and number of the lessons is set by law and depending on the type of licence the student wishes to acquire; a different number of lessons has to be attended. Remarkably enough, a student does not have to attend different lessons, they could theoretically attend the same lesson several times to meet the criteria. Lessons are divided into general knowledge about road rules that anyone studying for any licence might attend and specialised lessons for certain types of vehicles. To prepare for the written theory test, students usually obtain a study package from the driving school which can consist of software programmes, textbooks and sample exam papers. Schools usually take responsibility for their students' success and thus keep track of class attendance and hand out sample exams for practising. The theory test is a multiple-choice test consisting of randomised questions from a published guidebook. Thus the questions and correct answers can be studied in advance. Practical training also takes place with driving school instructors. Specially labelled and fitted vehicles are provided by the driving school. Cars are usually dual control (feature extra mirrors and pedals for the instructor so that they can take control of the vehicle in dangerous situations) since driving and parking maneuvers are taught on public roads. For motorcycles, the student operates the motorcycle on their own with a driving instructor following in another vehicle and giving instruction via radio. A certain number of practical and technical lessons has to be completed again depending on the type of vehicle. Obligatory lessons include a minimum number of lessons each driving on: the motorway Autobahn; rural areas, and in the dark. The actual number of lessons a student completes varies with individual skill. As the most difficult part of the driving test is usually urban driving, most lessons actually take place there, even though there is no mandated minimum for that. If a student wishes to be tested in a car with an automatic transmission and sits the road test in such a car, a code or note will be added to the licence and the holder will only be permitted drive cars with an automatic transmission. A test passed on a manual transmission car also gives qualification to drive either manual or automatic. Theoretical and practical training may be commenced at the same or different times. Some driving schools may insist a student attend a certain number of lessons before giving out appointments for driving lessons. Both exams are held by an authorised inspector who visits the driving school for this purpose. Students must pass the theory test before sitting the road test, with no more than a twelve month gap between the two. During the road test, the driving instructor is present in the car with the assisting features of the driving school car deactivated or connected to audio signals and a warning light (if the instructor has to intervene, the test will result in failure.) After each exam, results are immediately given to the students. In case of the road test, if the student meets all the required criteria, the licence is handed over by the inspector. Should the student, for any reason, not be allowed to hold the licence at the time of a successful test (for example because he has not yet reached the minimum age), the licence will be sent to the Kraftfahrzeug- Zulassungsbeh√∂rde (compare DMV DVLA) of the student's place of residence where it can be picked up as soon as the person becomes eligible. There are limits on the frequency and the time elapsed before failed tests can be reattempted. The failure rate for driving tests in 2011 was 28%. Automobile associations have given the opinion that this is due to the low quality of the education at driving schools as it benefits their income if students take additional lessons after failing. For cars, people aged seventeen do not get a standard driving licence after passing all required tests. Instead a permission slip that only allows for driving a car under the supervision of persons meeting certain criteria as stated on the permission slip. The actual driving licence becomes available upon the person's eighteenth birthday. The cost of obtaining a licence for driving a car is on average ‚Ç¨1,400 (US$1,800 in September 2014) but varies widely according to an individual's skill, city and region. Individual driving schools set their own prices. The total includes fees for: authorities and exams, learning materials, driving lessons and tuition. Card validity The Driving licence card is valid for 15 years, and is replaced with a new card when it expires. Before 19 January 2013, the driving licence card was valid without time limit. There is a decision that cards issued before that date expire on 19 January 2033. Although the driving licence is an official document issued by authorities, it has very limited validity as an identity card.F√ºhrerschein als Ersatz f√ºr Personalausweis?

The R51 is a modernized version of the John Pedersen-designed Remington Model 51 pistol now chambered in 9√ó19mm caliber.Quinn, Jeff, Remington‚Äôs New R51 9x19mm Plus P Semi-Automatic Pistol, GunBlast.com, 2 January 2014, retrieved 8 January 2014NAH Staff, New: Remington R51 Sub-Compact Handgun, North American Hunter, Huntingclub.com, retrieved 8 January 2014 Remington announced plans to offer the pistol in .40 S&W; and other calibers. However, no other chamberings were offered by the time of Remington's bankruptcy in 2018. Design details Pedersen's layout of the Remington R51 is copied in the Walther PPK pistol using a stationary barrel and recoil spring surrounding the barrel.Slowik, Max, Introducing the Remington R-51: Maybe You‚Äôve Met Before, Guns.com, 3 January 2014, retrieved 8 January 2014 However, a notable design feature is the use of a locking breech block within the slide utilizing the \\"hesitation-locked\\" action originally developed by John Pedersen. When the pistol is in battery, the breech block rests slightly forward of the locking shoulder in the frame. When the cartridge is fired, the bolt and slide move together a short distance rearward powered by the energy of the cartridge as in a standard blowback system. When the breech block meets the locking shoulder, it stops, locking the breech. The slide continues rearward with the momentum it acquired in the initial phase. This delay allows chamber pressure to drop while the breech remains locked and the cartridge slightly extracted. Once the bullet leaves the muzzle and pressure drops away, the rearward motion of the slide lifts the breech block from its locking recess through a sliding cam arrangement, continuing the operating cycle. Only manually retracting the slide with the grip safety held in, or firing a cartridge opens the pistol. Because the action halts cartridge extraction momentarily while holding locked the breech, the R51 is designed to use higher pressure cartridges than a straight blowback firearm with similar slide weight. The hesitation-locked Model 53 was based on the Model 51 design, and was built by Remington in .45 ACP for Navy trials. The Pedersen design has the recoil spring surrounding the barrel, reducing the pistol's overall profile. Lighter operating parts and longer lock time provide less felt and actual recoil. The R51's low bore axis gives less muzzle rise which also lowers perceived recoil, while the stationary barrel improves accuracy and simplifies construction. Like the original the new Remington R51 uses an internal hammer with a built-in drop safety and features a single-action trigger. The slide stop is mostly recessed into the left side of the frame. The primary safety is a grip safety which must be depressed before the pistol will fire. The R51 lacks the magazine safety that was present on the original model 51. The trigger guard is undercut to allow a higher grip on the frame. The frame has a 20-degree grip angle designed for natural point shooting, and has checkering on the front strap for improved grip of the gun. The R51 comes standard with polymer grip panels which are held on with conventional screws. Remington plans to offer optional rubber and rosewood grip panels as accessories for users desiring a wider, more hand-filling grip. The magazine is a steel single-column design with a polymer floorplate. Capacity is 7 rounds in 9√ó19mm. The magazine release is ambidextrous. The slide of the R51 is machined from stainless steel and has a matte black FNC finish, while the frame is machined from 7075 aluminum alloy and has a matte black anodized finishWhite, Phil, Remington Announces New R-51 Pistol, TheFirearmsBlog.Com, retrieved 7 January 2014 The 3.4\\" barrel is machined from 416 stainless steel and has a bright finish.Amselle, Jorge, Remington R51 9mm Gun Review, PersonalDefenseWorld.com, 2 January 2014, retrieved 7 January 2014/ Production problems A press release from Remington in July 2014 said that production of the R51 had been suspended and was expected to resume in October.

He has been considered by some to be a moderate Republican relative to Arizona's politics. He has a 76% lifetime conservative score from the American Conservative Union. According to a study by the Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting, State Senator Worsley voted with a majority of the Arizona Senate's Democrats 52% of the time, but still voted more often with his own party. = Abortion = Worsley opposes abortion.

He has been given an 80% rating by the Arizona Hospital and Healthcare Association. = Immigration = Worsley supports a pathway to legal residency for undocumented immigrants.

Early life Gradwell was born in New Brighton, Cheshire, England, the son of solicitor Joseph Gradwell and Gertrude Mary Theresa Taylor.1901 England Census He was educated at Stonyhurst College, Lancashire and then read classics at Balliol College, Oxford. By the time he graduated he spoke six languages. He joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman, serving in the First World War. Barrister At the cessation of hostilities, Gradwell was discharged from the Navy and started a pupillage in Liverpool and was called to the bar in 1925. He entered chambers in Liverpool, then practised as an advocate on the Northern Circuit. During his spare time, he enjoyed sailing in the Irish Sea and gained a coastal navigation certificate. Second World War At the outbreak of the Second World War, Gradwell was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a lieutenant. He returned to active service in 1942 and was given command of the anti-submarine warfare adapted Middlesbrough-built trawler MS Ayrshire, renamed HMS Ayrshire (FY 225), with a crew of volunteer fishermen. Attached as part of the defensive net around Convoy PQ 17, on receiving the third order to scatter on 4 July 1942, Gradwell concluded that as he was heading north to the Arctic ice shelf, he might as well take some merchant ships with him. Leading his convoy of Ayrshire and three merchant vessels ‚Äì the Panamanian-registered Troubador, the Ironclad, and the American-registered Silver Sword ‚Äì he proceeded north using only a sextant and the Times World Geographic Pocket Book, as his vessel lacked charts for this part of the Atlantic. On reaching the Arctic ice pack, the convoy found itself stuck fast, so the ships stopped engines and banked their fires. Gradwell arranged a defence, formulated around the fact that the Troubador was carrying a cargo of bunkering coal and drums of white paint: the crews painted all the vessels white, covered decks with white linen, and arranged the Sherman tanks on the merchant vessels' decks into a defensive ring, with loaded main armament. After a period of waiting, and having evaded the reconnoitring Luftwaffe aircraft, finding themselves unstuck they proceeded to the Matochkin Strait in Novaya Zemlya. They were found there by a flotilla of corvettes that escorted the four-ship convoy, plus two other merchant vessels, to the Russian port of Archangel, arriving on 25 July. Appointed Distinguished Service Cross on 15 September 1942, he later went on to command the ASW adapted whaler HMS Thirlmere (FY 206). London magistrate After the end of hostilities, Gradwell returned to his career in court. He was made a stipendiary magistrate on the London circuit at Marlborough Street Magistrates' Court in 1951, where he shared an office in a tempestuous relationship with Edward Robey, the son of comedian George Robey. A few months later, he contracted polio; after successful treatment, he returned to his position as magistrate. Dealing mainly with licensing cases, during his career Gradwell processed the case of Stephen Ward during the Profumo affair, committing Ward for trial at the Old Bailey in July 1963. After the British publishing rights to Hubert Selby, Jr.'s novel Last Exit to Brooklyn were acquired by Marion Boyars and John Calder in January 1966, Gradwell was the judge for the private prosecution brought by Sir Cyril Black, the then Conservative Member of Parliament for Wimbledon. The public prosecutor brought an action under Section 3 of the Obscene Publications Act, which Gradwell agreed with, and Gradwell ordered that all copies of the book be destroyed, though that applied only to seized copies within the Magistrate's Court.Forell, Claude. \\"A Noble Crusader for Purity.\\" The Age Literary Review, 25 March 1967.

The concept has been developed in the mid 1950s by phytosociologist Reinhold T√ºxen, partly expanding on the concept of climax. Concrete applications PNV is widely used in modern conservation and renaturation projects to predict the most adapted species for a definite ecotope. Native species being considered having optimum ecological resilience for their native environment, and the best potential to enhance biodiversity. To determine \\"natural\\" vegetation, scientists research the original vegetation of a land through retrospective ecology. Implications Study of past ecosystems allowed to demonstrate, for instance, that numerous contemporary biotopes (like the \\"wild\\" Slovenian forests for instance), supposedly largely untouched, were in fact very remote from their natural vegetation. (No citation) In Japan Prof. Akira Miyawaki, demonstrated after study that, on the one hand, long supposed \\"native species\\" had in fact been introduced on account of human intervention since over 1000 years (especially, coniferous being privileged over deciduous).

This is the third side chapel from the counterfa√ßade and was dedicated to St. Augustine. The cycle of beautiful quattrocento frescoes was executed by Pinturicchio and his workshop.Acidini, cit., pag. 184. History The chapel was furnished by Bishop Girolamo Basso della Rovere after his uncle, Pope Sixtus IV had reconstructed the basilica from 1472 to 1477. The painted decoration is attributed to Pinturicchio and his workshop, who worked here in an unspecified period between 1484, when the chapel was fitted, and 1492, when his patron received the bishopric of Palestrina instead of that of Recanati, which is mentioned in the dedicatory inscription on the monument of his father, Giovanni Basso. Description and style Compared to the nearby Chapel of the Nativity, frescoed by the same Pinturicchio, the Basso Della Rovere Chapel has a greater decorative fervour. The small chapel is hexagonal with a sexpartite ribbed vault and the entrance is protected by a slim 15th-century balustrade. On the side walls fake porphyry columns with Corinthian capitals support an entablature of white and gilded marble. They are placed on a pedestal which is decorated with painted benches and illusionistic monochrome reliefs. Two books were painted on one of the benches in perfect perspective, deceiving the viewer. The pedestal has remarkable similarities to the inlays of the small study of Guidobaldo da Montefeltro originally at Gubbio but now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.Acidini, cit., pag. 186. The monochromes were restored in the 19th century by Vincenzo Camuccini. The panels of the vault are covered by a lush floral decoration on a golden background with images of prophets in medaillons. General view The profusion of polychrome decoration is complemented by the maiolica floor tiles, contemporary works from Deruta, which show heraldic devices, Della Rovere trees, animals and other decorative motifs. The five lunettes are decorated with Stories from the Life of the Virgin, now much damaged and repainted. The great fresco of the Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints Augustine, Francis, Anthony of Padua and a Holy Monk above the altar, with a lunette that shows the God the Father Blessing, is enclosed by a white marble frame with rich golden decorations. There are two arched windows on the two adjacent walls with splays decorated with grotesques. The first wall is decorated by the fresco of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary while last section is covered by the funeral monument of Giovanni Basso (‚Ä†1483). That was created around 1485 by the workshop of Andrea Bregno. Its design is analogous to the now truncated tomb of Pietro Mellini in the Mellini Chapel and other similar monuments in Rome. The handling is less refined, when closely examined, but still a beautiful work.Gerald S. Davies, cit., pag. 305. The tomb is surmounted by a lunette fresco of the Dead Christ Supported by Two Angels attributed to Antonio da Viterbo.Acidini, cit., pag. 188. The marble Piet√† above the altar is the work of Gian Cristoforo Romano. The complex painted decoration, although in general following the Umbrian style, has the characteristics of multiple hands with very different individual accents. In addition to the assistants from the workshop of Pinturicchio and Perugino, the Bolognese Amico Aspertini may have participated in the stories of the martyrs on the false reliefs of the base, because he stayed in Rome in those years. One of the hands notably present in the main scenes, if not Pinturicchio himself, is assigned to a generic ‚ÄûMaster of the Basso Della Rovere Chapel‚Äù, perhaps recognizable even in the frescoes of the Piccolomini Library in the Cathedral of Siena.

The comic series originally appeared in 1968. The idea to adapt Bonvi's scripts to a film came from producers Ermanno Donati and Luigi Carpentieri who had recently produced another popular Italian production set in World War II, Salon Kitty. The two got in touch with Bonvi through screenwriter Vittorio Vighi. Filming was initially set to start in June 1976. The project eventually went through several different stages as Donati and Carpentieri were not convinced by the original director Ennio De Concini's vision of the film. The script was originally written by Vittorio Vighi and Maria Pia Fusco but these parts were dropped and director Salvatore Samperi signed as the director. De Concini later spoke about his involvement in Strumtruppen, stating that he \\"felt that my relationship with cinema was running out. [...] I did not feeling like doing [Strumptruppen]. I would have made a bad job and a bad movie.\\" Release Sturmtruppen was released in Italy in 1976. The film was a big box office hit in Italy, grossing over a one billion lire at the box office. The film's success led to a sequel ' which was written by Bonvi and again directed by Samperi.

It follows a teenage boy named Seth who, after drowning in the ocean, wakes up alone on a desolate suburban English street in what he believes to be hell.  Plot  The book begins with a 16-year-old boy, Seth Wearing, drowning. He finds himself in what he assumes is a hell made for him, as it resembles the Southern English town he was born in before moving to America but is completely abandoned. (The town's exact location is never stated, but it is within commuting distance of London.) Whenever he sleeps, he flashes back to events in his life. Seth remembers that when he was eight, he was left alone by his mother with his four-year-old brother, Owen. An escaped convict, let into the house by Seth, kidnapped Owen for three days. This left him with psychological damage and prompted the family's move to Halfmarket, a small coastal town in Washington, US. Also described is Seth's secret relationship with a male friend, Gudmund. In Seth's old bedroom, he finds an open coffin containing \\"conductive tape\\" and tubes, which he woke up in before fleeing. Later, Seth sees a black van driving through town. A girl, Regine, and a boy, Tomasz, prevent him from getting close to it, telling him that they must hide from what they call the Driver. They too had died and awoken in coffins. Regine tells Seth her theory ‚Äì on account of the world's decline the entire population decided to enter an simulated recreation (indistinguishable from reality) permanently, with automated coffins carrying out bodily functions. Therefore, the place they occupy is the real world. Global issues mentioned include fires, climate change, wars, epidemics, economic chaos and closures of European borders. The three children woke up in the real world because, while dying, they each knocked a system connection implant on the back of their heads. Seth wonders if more coffins are stored in the prison near his house, and decides to go there against the others' warnings. At the prison, Seth does find thousands of people in coffins, including his parents (but not Owen). By the next day, Seth recalls the true course of his life ‚Äì in reality, Owen was killed by the convict. His parents, unable to bear their grief, entered the online world permanently in a process called Lethe. Although the kidnapping could not be wiped from their memories, the death could, allowing them to resume their lives believing Owen was found and living with a digital replacement of him. The prototype's flaws were concealed by the \\"psychological damage\\" he had supposedly undergone. Soon after, world events led all of the human race to enter Lethe. Seth also reveals to the others that his own death was not accidental, instead he had committed suicide after he and Gudmund were outed and their relationship forcibly ended. The Driver seizes and reconnects Regine to a coffin, placing her back in Lethe so that she can die properly. Once rescued by Seth and Tomasz, Regine claims that she remembered the real world while she was back online. Seth theorizes that the gas from a particular tube numbs their memories, so if they do not inhale it, they can connect to the simulation while still remembering the real world. If Seth could be reinserted just before his death, he could choose not to go through with it, travel between both worlds and share the truth. The three set out to Seth's coffin, but are stopped by the Driver. A violent fight follows in which Seth is stabbed by the Driver. Inexplicably, the Driver itself heals Seth. Tomasz, not realizing this, uses the Driver's baton to destroy it. Seth takes to his coffin, and finally says, \\"I'm ready.\\" Reception More Than This was reviewed favorably by critics and readers. Martin Chilton of The Daily Telegraph describes the novel as \\"an impressively challenging and philosophical book for young adults,\\" capturing \\"ambiguity and bewilderment of being young and the uncertainty of what will happen to any of us next in life.\\" Tony Bradman of The Guardian concurred, writing: \\"Seth is a terrific exemplar of the eternal teenage desire for there to be, in the words of the novel's title, \\"more than this\\"\\". As of early March 2015 the book scores 4.04 out of 5 stars on the social reading site Goodreads. John Green's review of More Than This is printed on the front cover of the book.

He enrolled in Oberlin College in 1956 and earned his B.A. in sociology (summa cum laude) in 1960 with a minor in economics. He earned his Ph.D. in sociology at Harvard four years later in 1964, writing a dissertation titled Urban Social Stratification. While at Harvard, he was a research assistant for Talcott Parsons, Curriculum vitae, retrieved January 1, 2014. who was on his dissertation committee along with George Homans and Harrison White. Laumann was hired as an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Michigan in 1964, where he was the principal investigator of the Detroit Area Study. He moved to the University of Chicago in 1973, where he would eventually serve as the chair of the Department of Sociology, the Dean of the Social Sciences, as well as the Provost of the University. He was the editor of the American Journal of Sociology from 1978 to 1984 and from 1995 to 1997. He is currently the chairman of the board of trustees of the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago. NORC senior leadership and board information  Scholarly career  Laumann is known for his pioneering work in several areas of sociology. He is one of the founders of the field of social network analysis, and wrote some of the foundational work on networks of elites, organizational networks, and egocentric networks. He is equally well known for his work in the sociology of sexuality, both for his theoretical and empirical contributions to the field and for his years-long fight against Congress for funds to collect national data on American sexual norms and practices in the wake of the AIDS crisis. His PhD students have included, among others, Ronald Burt, Paula England, Joseph Galaskiewicz, Robert M. Hauser, and Kazuo Yamaguchi. = Social Network Analysis = In the mid-1960s, Laumann introduced the idea of studying individual social networks via surveys - an approach that led to the creation of widely available network data such as those in the General Social Survey. Inspired in part by W. Lloyd Warner's structural approach to social class, Laumann used individual-level social network data to demonstrate the ethnoreligious and class-based structuring of broader social networks.Edward O. Laumann. (1965). \\"Subjective Social Distance and Urban Occupational Stratification.\\" American Journal of Sociology, 71:26-36.Edward O Laumann. (1973). Bonds of Pluralism: The Form and Substance of Urban Social Networks. New York: Wiley Interscience.Edward O. Laumann, Richard Senter. (1976). \\"Subjective Social Distance, Occupational Stratification, and Forms of Status and Class Consciousness: A Cross-national Replication and Extension.\\" American Journal of Sociology 81:1304-1338. This work highlighted the tension individuals experience between their subjective preference to associate with people who are like them (the \\"like-me\\" hypothesis) and the sometimes contradictory desire to affiliate with higher-status individuals (the \\"prestige\\" hypothesis). Laumann argued that individuals' resolution of these impulses forms the basis of class consciousness within a given society.Laumann, Edward O. (2006). \\"A 45-year retrospective on doing networks.\\" Connections 27:65-90. Laumann also defined the \\"boundary specification problem,\\" which refers to the theoretical and methodological challenge of determining the appropriate set of actors and connections to analyze in order to identify the relevant social network within a given setting.Edward O. Laumann, Peter V. Marsden, and David Prensky. (1989). \\"The Boundary Specification Problem in Network Analysis.\\" Research Methods in Social Network Analysis 61:87. In the 1980s and 1990s, Laumann and colleagues published the first studies of the inter-organizational network of national policy interests in Washington, D.C.Edward O. Laumann and David Knoke. (1987). The Organizational State: Social Change in National Policy Domains. University of Wisconsin Press.John P. Heinz, Edward O. Laumann, Robert L. Nelson, and Robert H. Salisbury. (1993). The Hollow Core: Private Interests in National Policy Making. Harvard University Press. These are the most exhaustive empirical studies of the social networks of national organizations to date. They demonstrate that major public policy in important domains such as health and energy are shaped by latent social connections that exist among the leaders of numerous networked organizations (e.g., lay voluntary association, federal agencies, and professional societies). Policy decisions are disproportionately shaped by organizations that have vested interests in the outcomes of domain-specific issues and those that have greater capacity to monitor events and to obtain information/resources by virtue of their positions within the interorganizational network.Edward O. Laumann and David Knoke. (1987). The Organizational State: Social Change in National Policy Domains. University of Wisconsin Press.Charles Tilly. (1989). Review of The Organizational State: Social Choice in National Policy Domains, in American Journal of Sociology 95,(1):239-41. At the same time, organizations' positions within these networks varies by domain, such that there is no single core set of organizations that dominates resource or influence flows across different policy domains.John P. Heinz, Edward O. Laumann, Robert L. Nelson, and Robert H. Salisbury. (1993). The Hollow Core: Private Interests in National Policy Making. Harvard University Press.Paul A. Sabatier. (1994). Review of The Hollow Core: Private Interests in National Policy Making, in American Journal of Sociology 100(1):287-89. These studies forged innovative connections between social network analysis and data-reduction and display techniques, especially multidimensional scaling, and presented some of the earliest analyses of two-mode (actor-and-event) social network data. In recognition of these and his various other contributions to the field, Laumann was chosen as the keynote speaker at the first European social networks conference in Groningen, Netherlands in 1989,Freeman, Linton C. The Development of Social Network Analysis. Vancouver: Empirical Press, 2004. and at the Annual Sunbelt Conference in Vancouver, Canada in 2006.Laumann, Edward O. (2006). \\"A 45-year retrospective on doing networks.\\" Connections 27:65-90. = The Sociology of Sexuality = In the wake of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the mid-1980s, Laumann began to study the role of sexual behavior and social networks in the spread of the disease. Laumann and several colleagues - including Robert T. Michael, John Gagnon, Stuart Michaels, and Martina Morris - won a competition, first conceived by the NICHD in July 1987, to undertake a national survey of individuals' sexual practices and the social and sexual networks in which they occur.Laumann, Edward O. (2006). \\"A 45-year retrospective on doing networks.\\" Connections 27:65-90.Edward O. Laumann, John H. Gagnon, Robert T. Michael, and Stuart Michaels. (1994). The Social Organization of Sexuality, Chicago: University of Chicago Press. In 1989, Science magazine published a story about the upcoming study, which was still under review at the Office of Management and Budget. The story quickly gained national media attention, and Laumann and colleagues found themselves facing serious opposition from national politicians such as William E. Dannemeyer and Jesse Helms. Despite the support of other politicians, such as Daniel Patrick Moynihan and American Psychological Association lobbyist William A. Bailey,Laumann, Edward O. (2006). \\"A 45-year retrospective on doing networks.\\" Connections 27:65-90. the project eventually was blocked by an act of Congress in 1991, which diverted the funds for the project to a \\"say no to sex\\" campaign.Hunt, Morton M.

Laumann and his colleagues then turned to private funders, including the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the MacArthur Foundation, which together funded the resulting National Health and Social Life Survey.Laumann, Edward O.

(2006). \\"A 45-year retrospective on doing networks.\\" Connections 27:65-90. A key finding from this study was that Americans are fairly conservative in their sex practices. In retrospect, Laumann remarked: \\"Only at Chicago could we have so thoroughly managed to take the fun out of sex.\\"Page 80. Laumann, Edward O. (2006). \\"A 45-year retrospective on doing networks.\\" Connections 27:65-90. One of the team's primary conclusions was that, due to the social structuring of sexual contact, there was little chance of an AIDS epidemic within the heterosexual community - a scientific conclusion that challenged then-widespread, politically fueled rhetoric about the dangers of sex.Edward O. Laumann, John H. Gagnon, Robert T. Michael, and Stuart Michaels. (1994). The Social Organization of Sexuality, Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Laumann would also use the NHSLS data to write what would eventually become the most highly cited scientific study of sexual dysfunction written in any discipline - a paper published in 1999 in the Journal of the American Medical Association that documented the surprisingly widespread prevalence of sexual dysfunction in the U.S.Edward O. Laumann, Anthony Paik, and Raymond C. Rosen. (1999). \\"Sexual Dysfunction in the United States.\\" JAMA: the journal of the American Medical Association 281(6):537-44. Because he was recognized as one of the foremost experts in sexual behavior, sexual problems, and their public health implications, Laumann was brought on as a consultant by Pfizer in the mid-late 1990s and became instrumental in establishing the public interest in Viagra just prior to its release.Ray Moynihan and Barbara Mintzes.

Laumann is also a critic of the two Kinsey Reports and has noted that they both focused on the biology of sex and lacked psychological and clinical information and analysis.http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-compassionate-message-from-a-neighbor- at-the-right-time/  Honors  Laumann has been a member of Phi Beta Kappa since 1959, was a Ford Foundation Fellow in the behavioral sciences, is an affiliated scholar of the American Bar Foundation, and has won a number of other scholarly distinctions, Curriculum vitae, retrieved January 1, 2014. including election as Fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science and membership in the American Academy of Arts & Sciences. \\"2013 Fellows and their Affiliations at the Time of Election.\\" American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 2013.
