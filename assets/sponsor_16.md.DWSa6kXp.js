Hamstring injuries are common in athletes participating in many sports. Track and field athletes are particularly at risk, as hamstring injuries have been estimated to make up 29% of all injuries in sprinters. The biceps femoris long head is at the most risk for injury, possibly due to its reduced moment of knee and hip flexion as compared to the medial hamstrings. Diagnosis=Grades= Pulled hamstring Grade 1 Sensation of cramp or tightness and a slight feeling of pain when the muscles are stretched or contracted. Grade 2 With a grade two hamstring strain there is immediate pain which is more severe than the pain of a grade one injury. It is confirmed by pain on stretch, swelling and contraction of the muscle. Grade 3 Bruising due to strained hamstring, horizontal lines show where bandage was. A grade three hamstring strain is a severe injury. There is an immediate burning or stabbing pain and the individual is unable to walk without pain. The muscle is completely torn and there may be a large lump of muscle tissue above a depression where the tear is. After a few days with grade two and three injuries a large bruise may appear below the injury site caused by the bleeding within the tissues. Treatment Recommended treatment for this injury consists of the RICE protocol ‚Äî rest, ice, compression and elevation. The RICE method is primarily used to reduce bleeding and damage within the muscle tissue. Lower grade strains can easily become worse if the hamstring is not rested properly. Complete ruptures require surgical repair and rehabilitation. Initial treatment of the injury, regardless of the severity of the strain, is the same. Within the first five days, the hamstring is rested in an elevated position with an ice pack applied for twenty minutes every two hours. A compression bandage is applied to limit bleeding and swelling in the tissues. After five days of rest, active rehabilitation begins. Epidemiology An academic study found that the most common and prevalent musculoskeletal injury in the world is a hamstring strain.Orchard, J., & Seward, H. (2002, February). Epidemiology of injuries in the Australian Football League, seasons 1997-2000. British Journal of Sports Medicine, 36(1), 39-45. The study further explains that hamstring strains represented 15% of all injuries per club per season also had a 34% chance of recurrence. Another study showed that a previous hamstring injury is one of the most cited risks for future injury, with as many as one-third of active individuals experiencing a re-injury within 2 weeks of returning to activity.Sherry, M. A., Johnston, T. S., & Heiderscheit, B. C. (2015, April). Rehabilitation of Acute Hamstring Strain Injuries. Clinics in Sports Medicine, 34(2), 263-284. A meta-analysis article showed evidence that a history of hamstring injury and being of older age were associated with increased risk of hamstring strains.Freckleton, G., & Pizzari, T. (2013, April). Risk factors for hamstring muscle strain injury in sport: a systematic review and meta- analysis. British Journal of Sports Medicine, 47(6), 351-358. One study found that men and master athletes (athletes older than forty) were at an increased risk of hamstring strains compared with women and younger athletes.Opar, D. A., Drezner, J., Williams, M., Webner, D., Sennett, B., Kapur, R., Cronholm, P.F.(2014). Acute hamstring strain injury in track-and-field athletes: A 3-year observational study at the Penn Relay Carnival. Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports, 254-259. Women were approximately 3 times more likely to suffer hamstring strain than males with the majority of these being non-sporting scenarios. Similarly the average age of non-sporting hamstring strains are from the ages of 40-60. Many of these non-sporting injuries are sustained during road traffic accidents, slipping, and falling. These results also show that hamstring strains account for 50% of muscle injuries received by sprinters and are the most common injury in hurdling.Ahmad, C.S., Redler, L.H., Ciccotti, M.G., Maffulli, N., Longo, U.G., & Bradley, J. (2013, December). Evaluation and Management of Hamstring Injuries. The American Journal of Sports Medicine, 41(12), 2933-2947. One explanation is that older active individuals may be at greater risk due to lower levels of eccentric knee flexor strength compared with their younger counterparts. However, it is unclear whether flexibility serves as a risk factor; this topic should be researched in the future to further understand the relationship between flexibility and risk of injury.Dalton, S. L., Kerr, Z.Y., & Dompier, T.P.(2015). Epidemiology of Hamstring Strains in 25 NCAA Sports in the 2009-2010 to 2013-2014 Academic Years. American Journal of Sports Medicine, 43(11), 2671-2679. Muscle weakness has also been an implication as a predisposing factor for both primary and recurring hamstring strain injuries.Kuske B, Hamilton DF, Pattle SB, Simpson AHRW (2016) Patterns of Hamstring Muscle Tears in the General Population: A Systematic Review. PLoS ONE 11(5):e0152855.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0152855 Over a 10-year study more than 51.3% of hamstring strains occurred during the preseason of athletics. In another study, that analyzed 25 NCAA sports over four years, it was clearly shown that hamstring strain rates are higher in the preseason. The factors that are being implicated in this trend are the relative deterioration and muscle weakness that occur during the off-season. The hamstrings undergo a complex dynamic process during gait, making it unsurprising that they are frequently injured. They must first contract concentrically during the end of the stance phase in order to bend the knee and allow the foot (along with dorsiflexion at the ankle) to clear the ground. At the end of the swing phase the hamstrings must eccentrically contract while applying a braking moment to knee extension, then immediately change functions to again concentrically contract and produce hip extension. Studies have shown that ‚Äúthe hamstring group reaches peak elongation and acts eccentrically at the hip and knee during the late swing phases of running‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe hamstrings are most active and develop the greatest torques at the hip and knee during the late swing through midstance phase of running.‚Äù Thus, the hamstrings reach their maximum length while attempting to forcefully contract eccentrically and switch functions to immediately produce a concentric contraction, which makes the terminal part of swing phase the most vulnerable for injury. There have been many other proposed predisposing factors to injury. These include muscle weakness, muscle imbalance, poor flexibility, fatigue, inadequate warm up, poor neuromuscular control, and poor running technique. One of the few predisposing factors that most researchers agree upon however is previous hamstring injury. Brokett et al. (2004) stated that ‚Äúthe athletes most at risk of a hamstring strain are those with a previous history of such injury‚Äù and noted that 34% of the hamstring injuries were recurrences.‚Äù Cameron et al. also found that 34% of injuries recur in the same season. Arnason et al. generalized these numbers, saying that previous injury was in itself an independent risk factor for re-injury.

These products include additives for engine oils and other transportation-related fluids, additives for industrial lubricants, and additives for gasoline and diesel fuel. In addition, Lubrizol makes ingredients and additives for personal care products, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, specialty materials, including plastics technology, and coatings in the form of specialty resins and additives. Since 2011, Lubrizol has been a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. It generated $6.5 billion in revenue in 2016 and has an employee headcount of approximately 8,300 people globally. Eric R. Schnur is the current president, chairman and CEO.  History  The Lubrizol Corporation was founded in 1928 as The Graphite Oil Products Company in Cleveland, Ohio, by father Frank A. Nason and son Francis A. \\"Alex\\" Nason, Thomas W. James and brothers Kent H. Smith, Vincent K. Smith and A. Kelvin Smith. The company's first product was a graphite lubricant and applicator for early automobiles. In 1929, the company changed its name to The Lubri-Graph Corporation. It moved to Wickliffe, Ohio in 1931. In 1934, Lubri-Graph changed its name to The Lubri-Zol Corporation. The name changed to Lubrizol in 1943. The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in the 1960s. Toward the end of that decade, Lubrizol focused on developing products to help make cars cleaner and more fuel efficient. During the 1980s, the company created new additives for passenger motor oils, gear oils, hydraulic fluids and viscosity modifiers, while also eyeing biotechnology, agribusiness and specialty chemicals for other applications to expand beyond the transportation field. Lubrizol acquired Noveon International in 2004 for 920 million in cash and the assumption of 920 million in debt. That move, along with others, helped Lubrizol expand beyond its additives business and create a second business segment, Lubrizol Advanced Materials, producing industrial chemicals for packaging, paints and textiles, chemicals for personal-care products such as lotions and shampoos, and additives and ingredients for engineered polymers, in addition to products for the medical devices and pharmaceutical markets. Berkshire Hathaway announced on March 14, 2011 that it would acquire Lubrizol for 9.7 billion in cash. This happened just weeks after a top Berkshire executive, David Sokol, made a major bet on the stock price with his own money. That deal closed in September 2011. In December 2014, Lubrizol bought Weatherford International's engineered chemistry and drilling fluids businesses in a deal valued at 825 million. This resulted in creation of the company's third business segment, Lubrizol Oilfield Solutions. The company announced that it eliminated Lubrizol Oilfield Operations business segment in February 2017. Lubrizol's expansion in other areas of business in the 2000s included a 10-year phased investment plan launched in 2010. The plan, which sought to increase global capacity in additives, featured a plant in Zhuhai, China, among others. Additionally, the company expanded its life sciences unit with the announcement of a $60 million investment to expand its excipient, global polymer and contract manufacturing plants. The new facilities are expected to provide a flow through process for customers. Lubrizol took the majority stake in Lubrizol India Private Ltd., its Indian joint venture with Indian Oil Corp., in March 2017. In April 2020, the company asked for Section 301 tariff relief for glutaraldehyde, which had 25% tariffs due to Trump's 2018 China‚ÄìUnited States trade war. The company's relief application said it could be helpful as a disinfectant against COVID-19; the application made no mention of its use for fracking or the company's primary market being the oil industry. Operations The Lubrizol Corporation is broken down into two business segments, Lubrizol Additives and Lubrizol Advanced Materials. =Lubrizol Additives= With Lubrizol Additives, the company supplies additives for transportation, including additives for lubricating engine oils, fuels and other chemicals, and industrial lubricants. =Lubrizol Advanced Materials= Lubrizol Advanced Materials creates and sells specialty materials and chemicals used in consumer products for personal care, pharmaceutical and food industries; specialty materials under the TempRite, Hycar and Estane trademarks; and performance coatings under the trademarks Hycar, Sancure, Algan, Performax and Myflam. Lubrizol had operated Lubrizol Oilfield Solutions, an oilfield chemicals and drilling fluids business, following the 2014 acquisition of Weatherford International businesses. Bloomberg reported in February 2017 that Lubrizol eliminated the oilfield solutions business segment. = Industrial accidents = * See :fr:Incendie de l'usine Lubrizol √† Rouen Sites in and around Rouen (France) have been the site of numerous industrial incidents: * In 1975 and 1989, two incidents (similar to the one that will occur in 2013) result in the emission of mercaptans. * On April 16, 2003, a fire damaged the facilities of the Oudalle factory without causing any casualties. * On January 21, 2013, an incident occurred at the Lubrizol plant located in Rouen (Seine-Maritime): the chemical decomposition of a zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP) tank resulted in the emission of a cloud of gas composed of a cocktail of mercaptans (probably dominated by isopropyl mercaptan), whose odor was perceptible far beyond the Rouen site by several hundred thousand people, the plume from south of London to the Paris region (\\"Complaints of local residents citing bad smells, headaches or nausea were thus collected by the poison and toxicovigilance centers (CAPTV) and Air normand between 21 and 22 January). The hazard study had modeled the risk of decomposition of zinc dialkyldithiophosphate, a risk also taken into account in the development of the PPRT: according to this modeling, H2S can be emitted (highly toxic with fatal or irreversible effects beyond certain thresholds, thresholds not reached in the environment during the event of 21 January). This decomposition is also a source of large quantities of mercaptans, gases known to be not very toxic but whose olfactory threshold is very low (10,000 times lower than the concentrations reached in the air that day). The genes or headaches related to this type of event have not been integrated in the PPRT, but must be included in emergency plans (PPI ...). After analyzing the accident, corrective measures were submitted to CODERST (May 2013) and then imposed on the factory via a prefectural order (June 2013). These measures are: better monitoring of the temperature of the adjustment tanks, new automatic safety systems, an analysis of the stirring and refrigeration needs of the tanks (decalcification, new refrigeration means, etc.), new monitoring tools process, manufacturing and alarm, an improved process of response in case of decomposition, improvement of the measurement system of mercaptans in the stack and finally the resizing of the system treating releases to the air in case of decomposition. The implementation of these measures was verified by the DREAL on June 11 and 12, 2013. The invisible but fragrant plume of mercaptans was retrospectively modeled (publication 2015). * On September 3, 2019, a fire broke out at the Lubrizol plant in Oudalle, near Le Havre (Seine- Maritime). 50 firefighters and 12 vehicles were mobilized. * On September 26, 2019, explosions and a fire (major accident) impacted the company‚Äôs manufacturing site in Rouen, France, in addition to a neighboring site. 240 firefighters and 200 vehicles were mobilized, including some from Paris. The authorities ordered the evacuation of the population within a radius of 500 meters around the factory, closed schools of the surrounding municipalities, and later recommended not having direct contact with the soot or eating the crops and food products exposed to it. The company created a public web page to share more on this event. https://www.lubrizol.com/rouen Acquisitions and partnerships Lubrizol has grown its business through a number of acquisitions and partnerships in recent years.

The transmitter is located on Roslyn Road in Osborne Village. History The station signed on the air on December 2, 2006 on 104.7 FM, originally on a special events license issued by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and Industry Canada. As a way to comply with the special events license, CJNU operated as a means of spreading awareness for various non-profit organizations and charities in the Winnipeg area. Each month, the station broadcast in support of a different organization, remaining on the air for up to 28 days at a time. Businesses or companies also sponsored portions of the broadcast day to assist the station in its mission to keep nostalgia music on the air. Members of the public would also purchase a membership, entitling them to a vote at member meetings. The broadcast schedule included a number of veteran Winnipeg air personalities, broadcasting students, and other volunteers. In 2008, the station relocated to 107.9 FM, following the revocation of CJWV-FM's license on that frequency.

It is one of the lesser-known works in the influential group of \\"New Hollywood\\" films of the late 1960s and early 1970s made by independent production house Raybert Productions (The Monkees, Easy Rider) and its successor, BBS Productions. Based upon the 1964 novel of the same title by Jeremy Larner, the film, which stars William Tepper, is notable as the directorial debut of Jack Nicholson (who also wrote the screenplay) following his breakthrough as an actor in Easy Rider (1969) and Five Easy Pieces (1970). Although it was coolly received at the time, and has subsequently faded into obscurity, the production brought together many significant Hollywood names. Director of photography Bill Butler gained renown for his later work on classic films such as Steven Spielberg's Jaws, Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Original music was composed by David Shire (then married to Coppola's sister, Talia) and the screenplay included uncredited contributions from future director Terence Malick. It starred several of Nicholson's friends and frequent screen collaborators in leading roles ‚Äì Karen Black, Bruce Dern, Robert Towne and Henry Jaglom (although Towne and Jaglom became better known as screenwriter and director, respectively). Several younger actors who became familiar TV faces in later years were also featured in small supporting roles, including David Ogden Stiers (M*A*S*H), Cindy Williams (Laverne & Shirley) and Michael Warren (Hill Street Blues), who (like Tepper) was also a former collegiate basketball player. It was filmed on the campus of the University of Oregon and other locations in Eugene, Oregon. The film is also notable for its then- controversial use of profanity, its depictions of sex and drug use, and for several scenes of male frontal nudity, including a locker-room shower scene, and the mental breakdown scene in which Gabriel (Margotta) is shown frontally nude, which led to an attempt by the censor to give the film an X rating. The title comes from the poem \\"I Know A Man\\" by Robert Creeley, which a character recites in the opening scene. It also serves as a cryptic reference to basketball, the movie's dominant milieu. Plot Hector Bloom is a laconic, libidinous college basketball star distracted by obligations and current events: the misadventures of his volatile roommate Gabriel, a potential pro career, the draft, campus unrest, and a turbulent affair with Olive, the wife of Richard, a professor and friend. His coach pays special attention to him, given Hector's abilities, but is unsure how to get him to focus and fulfill his potential. Hector's attitude, and his coach's frustration, is exemplified by a meeting before an important late-season game where the coach instructs him to \\"play it straight out there tonight, I don't want any fooling around at all\\"; to his coach's exasperation, Hector replies \\"Why not?\\" Gabriel, a vulgar borderline psychotic, is far more troubled and committed to rebellion than Hector. He abuses drugs, disrupts a basketball game with a guerrilla theatre stunt, goes crazy during an induction physical, ransacks his apartment, espouses anti-establishment views about everything, and drifts aimlessly. During a confrontation in a grocery store, Olive informs Hector that she is pregnant, implies he is not the father, and tells him their affair is over. Hector replies that he has \\"the clap\\", which infuriates Olive; she warns him that if he follows her, she will call the police. That night, Hector leads his team to a huge victory; the fans storm the court, and triumphantly carry Hector off. At the same time, Gabriel breaks into Olive's house while she is bathing and physically assaults her. She fends off his attack, eventually running outdoors with Gabriel in pursuit just as Hector drives up. Gabriel, aware of Hector's trysts with Olive, screams at Hector that Olive prefers him over Richard, then runs off when Richard arrives home. Hector confronts Richard, telling him Olive should be with him; a shaken Olive asserts her independence, saying, \\"I'm not going with anybody, anywhere\\". Richard warns Hector \\"I'll kill you\\", then escorts Olive back into their house. The next morning Gabriel, completely naked, runs into a biology lab and frees snakes, an iguana, mice and other vermin. Eventually campus police and white-coated attendants arrive with a straitjacket; Gabriel rebuffs them, insisting he is both \\"right and sane\\". They cloak him in a blanket and lead him into a padded van. Hector, seeing this, jumps onto the back of the van, demanding they open it. As the van pulls away, he jumps off, yelling to Gabriel that his mother called. CastProduction Filming took place in Eugene, Oregon. Critical reception The film was entered into the 1971 Cannes Film Festival, where it encountered a stormy reception; The New York Times reported that the movie \\"set off the most violently negative reaction from an audience at the festival this year. As the lights came up, the people hooted, screamed and whistled. Some got to their feet and waved indignant fists toward where Nicholson and his two actors, William Tepper and Michael Margotta, were seated.\\"Grenier, Cynthia (May 25, 1971). The New York Times. 44. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four and called it \\"a disorganized but occasionally brilliant movie,\\" with the performances being \\"the best thing in the movie. Nicholson himself is a tremendously interesting screen actor, and he directs his actors to achieve a kind of intimacy and intensity that is genuinely rare. But if Nicholson is good on the nuances, he's weak on the overall direction of his film. It doesn't hang together for us as a unified piece of work.\\"Ebert, Roger Drive, He Said., RogerEbert.com Retrieved May 12, 2019. Vincent Canby of The New York Times declared, \\"It is not a great film, but it is an often intelligent one, and it is so much better than all of the rest of the campus junk Hollywood has manufactured that it can be indulged in its sentimental conventions.\\"Canby, Vincent (June 14, 1971). \\"Screen: Nicholson's 'Drive, He Said'\\".

Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post commented, \\"While it's not an untalented picture, it is an exasperating and finally insufferable one, because none of its potentially interesting themes or characters ever takes hold ...

The Washington Post. B6. Pauline Kael, looking back on the film in 1978, called it \\"perhaps the most ambitious, chaotic, and daring of the counterculture films‚Äîit had a deranged, dissociated vitality.

Electoral system :Source: The electoral system used for the European elections was based on proportional representation, comparable to the system traditionally used in Austria for legislative elections. The parties put forward lists of candidates. The seats are shared out on the basis of the percentage of the votes obtained by each list. Because of the limited number of seats, the lists were identical for the whole of Austria; there were no regional lists. The threshold required to win a seat was 4%. Candidates who win 7% of the total 'preference votes' obtained by their party would win one of the seats accorded to the party, irrespective of their position on the list. The lists of candidates had to be signed by three members of the national parliament, or by one Member of the European Parliament, or by 2600 voters. The minimum voting age was 18.

Electoral system :Source:European elections in Austria and Finland All Finnish citizens that were 18 years old on the election day at the latest, were eligible to vote. They did not have to register as it was done automatically by the authorities. Other citizens of the European Union who had a domicile in Finland on 30 August 1996 were eligible to vote, although they had to register as voters in Finland and confirm that they did not vote in any other Member State during the elections in 1994 and 1995, and would not vote in Austria in 1996. According to the Finnish Population Register Center (V√§estrekisterikeskus) there were at the end of August 1996 some 72600 foreigners living in Finland. Biggest national groups willing to vote were the Swedes, the Germans and the British. The final date for the registration was 15 August 1996. In June V√§estrekisterikeskus approached with an official letter all the EU nationals living in Finland. The letter was in Finnish, Swedish, English, French and German. In the European elections candidates could be nominated by the registered political parties and citizens' groups. The parties could do the nomination automatically. The other groups had to gather supporting signatures for each of their candidates from each of the four election districts i.e. each candidate must have had 4 x 1000 supporting signatures. This meant that a non-party organization wanting to nominate the maximum number (16) of candidates had to collect 64000 signatures altogether. The parties and other groups could choose between two different systems. They could nominate candidates for the whole country or for a region. For the elections Finland was divided into four districts. However, all the parties nominated candidates for the whole country. The deadline for the parties and other organizations to put forward candidates was 19 September 1996. There were 14 parties and one other organization in the elections. The total number of candidates was 207.

Beginning in the late 1840s, individuals of black African descent were prohibited from ordination to the LDS Church's priesthood--normally held by all male members who meet church standards of spiritual \\"worthiness\\"--and from receiving temple ordinances such as the endowment and celestial marriage (sealing). The origins of the policy are still unclear: during the 20th century, most church members and leaders believed the policy had originated during founding prophet Joseph Smith's time, but church research in the 1960s and 1970s found no evidence of the prohibition before the presidency of Brigham Young.Lester E. Bush, Jr. (1973), \\"Mormonism's Negro Doctrine\\", in Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 8 (Spring 1973): 11‚Äì68, cited in Kimball (2005), p. 196‚Äì97 LDS Church presidents Heber J. Grant and David O. McKay are known to have privately stated that the restriction was a temporary one, and would be lifted at a future date by a divine revelation to a church president. In 2013, the LDS Church posted an essay stating that the ban was based more on racism than revelation and disavowed racist theories for the origin of the ban. Background Men of black African descent were permitted to hold the priesthood in the early years of the Latter Day Saint movement, when Joseph Smith was alive. After Smith died, Brigham Young became leader of the LDS Church and many were excluded from holding the priesthood. This practice persisted after Young's death, and was maintained until the announcement of the 1978 revelation. Events leading up to the revelation In the decades leading up to the 1978 revelation, it became increasingly difficult for the church to maintain its policy on Africans and the priesthood. The difficulties arose both from outside protests and internal challenges encountered as the membership grew in far away areas of the world outside of the predominantly white Utah. Internal challenges in administering the priesthood ban were mainly due to the difficulty in determining which peoples were of African ancestry in areas such as Brazil, the Philippines and Caribbean and Polynesian Islands as well as shortages of available people for local church leadership positions in areas with a predominantly black population such as Nigeria or the Dominican Republic. The majority of the protests against the policy coincided with the rise of the civil rights movement in the United States during the 1960s. In 1963, Hugh B. Brown made a statement on civil rights during General Conference in order to avert a planned protest of the conference by the NAACP. During the late 1960s and 1970s, black athletes at some universities refused to compete against teams from church owned Brigham Young University. A protest in 1974 was in response to the exclusion of black scouts to become leaders in church sponsored Boy Scout troops. By 1978, when the policy was changed, external pressure had slackened somewhat. In the 1960s, an effort was made to establish a church presence in Nigeria where many natives had expressed interest. Church leaders found it difficult to make progress in establishing the church in that region without a change in the priesthood policy. Issues regarding possible expansion in Nigeria were considered in correspondence between the South African Mission and church general authorities from as early as 1946. LDS Church leaders in the Caribbean, notably in the Dominican Republic (described at the time as 98% black), had expressed the difficulty of proselytizing efforts in the region due to priesthood restrictions. In 1969, during a weekly meeting the apostles voted to overturn the priesthood ban. However, Harold B. Lee, a senior apostle at the time, was not present due to travel. When he returned he made the argument that the ban could not be overturned administratively but rather required a revelation from God. Lee called for a re-vote, which did not pass.Quinn, Michael D. The Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power Salt Lake City: 1994 Signature Books, p. 14. On March 1, 1975, LDS Church president Spencer W. Kimball announced plans to build a temple in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Before the 1978 revelation, not only were men of black African descent denied ordination to the priesthood, but men and women of black African descent were also excluded from performing most of the various ordinances in the temple. Determining priesthood and temple eligibility in Brazil was problematic due to the considerable miscegenation between Amerindians, Europeans, and Africans since 1500, and high uncertainty in tracing ancestral roots. Furthermore, in the Brazilian culture, racial identification had more to do with physical appearance and social class than blood lines. The cultural differences in understanding race created confusion between the native Brazilians and the American missionaries. When the temple was announced, church leaders realized the difficulty of restricting persons with various bloodlines from attending the temple in Brazil. During the first half of the 20th century, most church members and leaders believed the priesthood ban had originated with church founder Joseph Smith. Because of this belief, church leaders were hesitant to overturn the ban. Scholars in the 1960s and 1970s found no evidence of the prohibition before Brigham Young.Lester E. Bush, Jr. (1973), \\"Mormonism's Negro Doctrine\\", in Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 8 (Spring 1973): 11‚Äì68, cited in Kimball (2005), pp. 196‚Äì97. This evidence made it easier for Kimball to consider making a change. =Softening of the policy= Prior to the complete overturning of the priesthood ban by revelation, several administrative actions were taken to soften its effect. Before David O. McKay visited the South Africa mission in 1954, the policy was that any man desiring to receive the priesthood in the mission was required to prove a lack of African ancestors in his genealogy. Six missionaries were tasked with assisting in the necessary genealogical research but even then it was often difficult to establish lack of African ancestry. McKay changed the policy to presume non-African ancestry except when there was evidence to the contrary. This change allowed many more people to be ordained without establishing genealogical proof. Four years later, McKay gave permission for Fijians to receive the priesthood despite their dark skin color. Thus, the priesthood ban was restricted to those people who were specifically of African descent. In 1967, the same policy that was used in South Africa was extended to cover Brazilians as well. In 1974, blacks were allowed to serve as proxies for baptisms for the dead. Revelation In the years prior to his presidency, Spencer W. Kimball kept a binder of notes and clippings related to the issue. In the first years of his presidency, he was recorded as frequently making the issue one of investigation and prayer. In June 1977, Kimball asked at least three general authorities--apostles Bruce R. McConkie, Thomas S. Monson, and Boyd K. Packer--to submit memos \\"on the doctrinal basis of the prohibition and how a change might affect the Church\\", to which McConkie wrote a long treatise concluding there were no scriptural impediments to a change. During 1977, Kimball obtained a personal key to the Salt Lake Temple for entering in the evenings after the temple closed, and often spent hours alone in its upper rooms praying for divine guidance on a possible change. On May 30, 1978, Kimball presented his two counselors with a statement he had written in longhand removing all racial restrictions on ordination to the priesthood, stating that he \\"had a good, warm feeling about it.\\" On June 1, 1978, following the monthly meeting of general authorities in the Salt Lake Temple, Kimball asked his counselors and the ten members of Quorum of the Twelve Apostles then present to remain behind for a special meeting. Kimball began by describing his studies, thoughts, and prayers on removing the restriction and on his growing assurance that the time had come for the change. Kimball asked each of the men present to share their views, and all spoke in favor of changing the policy. After all present had shared their views, Kimball led the gathered apostles in a prayer circle to seek final divine approval for the change. As Kimball prayed, many in the group recorded feeling a powerful spiritual confirmation. Bruce R. McConkie later said: \\"There are no words to describe the sensation, but simultaneously the Twelve and the three members of the First Presidency had the Holy Ghost descend upon them and they knew that God had manifested his will .... I had had some remarkable spiritual experiences before ... but nothing of this magnitude.\\"Bruce R. McConkie, \\"The Receipt of the Revelation Offering the Priesthood to Men of All Races and Colors\\", June 30, 1978, Kimball Papers; cited in and . L. Tom Perry described: \\"I felt something like the rushing of wind. There was a feeling that came over the whole group. When President Kimball got up he was visibly relieved and overjoyed.\\" Gordon B. Hinckley later said: \\"For me, it felt as if a conduit opened between the heavenly throne and the kneeling, pleading prophet of God who was joined by his Brethren.\\"Gordon B. Hinckley, \\"Priesthood Restoration\\", Ensign, October 1988. The church formally announced the change on June 9, 1978. The story led many national news broadcasts and was on the front page of most American newspapers, and in most largely Latter-day Saint communities in Utah and Idaho telephone networks were completely jammed with excited callers. The announcement was formally approved by the church at the October 1978 general conference, and is included in LDS Church's edition of the Doctrine and Covenants as Official Declaration 2. Revelation accepted at general conference On September 30, 1978, during the church's 148th Semiannual General Conference, the following was presented by N. Eldon Tanner, First Counselor in the First Presidency: > In early June of this year, the First Presidency announced that a revelation > had been received by President Spencer W. Kimball extending priesthood and > temple blessings to all worthy male members of the Church. President Kimball > has asked that I advise the conference that after he had received this > revelation, which came to him after extended meditation and prayer in the > sacred rooms of the holy temple, he presented it to his counselors, who > accepted it and approved it. It was then presented to the Quorum of the > Twelve Apostles, who unanimously approved it, and was subsequently presented > to all other General Authorities, who likewise approved it > unanimously.Official Declaration 2, Doctrine and Covenants, a standard work > of the LDS Church. On that day, the general conference unanimously voted to accept the revelation \\"as the word and will of the Lord.\\" Ramifications Following the revelation, black male members were allowed to be ordained to the priesthood. Black members and their spouses regardless of race were allowed to enter the temple and undergo the temple rituals, including celestial marriages. Black members could be adopted into a tribe of Israel through a patriarchal blessing. Black members were also allowed to serve missions and hold leadership positions. Proselytization restrictions were removed, so missionaries no longer needed special permission to teach black people, converts were no longer asked about African heritage, and marks were no longer made on membership records indicating African heritage. Statements after the revelation Later in 1978, apostle Bruce R. McConkie said: > There are statements in our literature by the early brethren which we have > interpreted to mean that the Negroes would not receive the priesthood in > mortality. I have said the same things, and people write me letters and say, > \\"You said such and such, and how is it now that we do such and such?\\" And > all I can say to that is that it is time disbelieving people repented and > got in line and believed in a living, modern prophet. Forget everything that > I have said, or what President Brigham Young or President George Q. Cannon > or whomsoever has said in days past that is contrary to the present > revelation. We spoke with a limited understanding and without the light and > knowledge that now has come into the world.... We get our truth and our > light line upon line and precept upon precept. We have now had added a new > flood of intelligence and light on this particular subject, and it erases > all the darkness and all the views and all the thoughts of the past. They > don‚Äôt matter any more.... It doesn‚Äôt make a particle of difference what > anybody ever said about the Negro matter before the first day of June of > this year. > as found in: On the topic of doctrine and policy for the race ban lifting the apostle Dallin H. Oaks stated in 1988, \\"I don‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs possible to distinguish between policy and doctrine in a church that believes in continuing revelation and sustains its leader as a prophet. ... I‚Äôm not sure I could justify the difference in doctrine and policy in the fact that before 1978 a person could not hold the priesthood and after 1978 they could hold the priesthood.\\" In 2013, the LDS Church posted an essay on the priesthood ban, stating that the ban was based more on racism than revelation. The essay places the origin of the ban on Brigham Young, arguing there was no evidence any black men were denied the priesthood during Joseph Smith. The essay also disavowed theories promoted in the past including \\"that black skin is a sign of divine disfavor or curse, or that it reflects actions in a premortal life; that mixed-race marriages are a sin; or that blacks or people of any other race or ethnicity are inferior in any way to anyone else.\\" Official Declaration 2 Official Declaration 2 is the canonized formal 1978 announcement by the church's First Presidency that the priesthood would no longer be subject to restrictions based on race or skin color. The declaration was canonized by the LDS Church at its general conference on September 30, 1978, through the process of common consent.. Since 1981, the text has been included in the church's Doctrine and Covenants, one of its standard works of scripture.. It is the most recent text that has been added to the LDS Church's open canon of scripture.Sections 137 and 138 of the Doctrine and Covenants were added to the D&C; in 1981; however, these texts had been part of the canon in the Pearl of Great Price since 1976: ‚óå ‚óå . The announcement that was canonized had previously been announced by a June 8, 1978, letter from the First Presidency, which was composed of Spencer W. Kimball, N. Eldon Tanner, and Marion G. Romney. Unlike much of the Doctrine and Covenants, Official Declaration 2 is not itself presented as a revelation from God. However, its text announces that Jesus Christ \\"by revelation has confirmed that the long-promised day has come when every faithful, worthy man in the Church may receive the holy priesthood.\\" Thus, it is regarded as \\"the official declaration of the revelation.\\". No text of the revelation has been released by the church, but it is common for Latter-day Saints to refer to the \\"revelation on the priesthood\\" in describing the changes wrought by the announcement and canonization of Official Declaration 2.See, e.g.: . Modern clarification disavows reasons for the restrictions Sometime between 2014 and 2015, the LDS Church, in publishing essays to expand understanding of church doctrines and policies, focused one on the subject of \\"Race and the Priesthood\\". As part of that essay, the church officially acknowledged that the reasons for the previous racial restrictions were unknown, and officially disavowed the racist explanations for the policy.Gospel Topics Essays: Race and the Priesthood, lds.org.

Life Arthur Michael was born into a wealthy family in Buffalo, New York in 1853, the son of John and Clara Michael, well-off real-estate investor. He was educated in that same city, learning chemistry both from a local teacher and in his own homebuilt laboratory. An illness thwarted Michael's plans to attend Harvard, and instead in 1871 he traveled to Europe with his parents and decided to study in Germany. He studied in Hofmann's chemical laboratory in Berlin at the University of Berlin, he studied with Robert Bunsen at Heidelberg University and after 2 years again in Berlin with Hofmann. He then studied for another year with Wurtz at the √âcole de M√©decine in Paris and with Dmitri Mendeleev in St. Petersburg. Returning to the United States in 1880, Michael became Professor of Chemistry at Tufts College where he taught from 1882-1889. He received an A. M. degree from Tufts in 1882, and a Ph. D. in 1890. At Tufts College, Michael met and married, in 1888, one of his own science students, Helen Cecilia De Silver Abbott. Following several years in England, during which the couple worked in a self-constructed laboratory on the Isle of Wight, they returned to the United States in 1894 where Arthur Michael again taught at Tufts, leaving in 1907 as an emeritus professor. Michael's retirement from academia lasted but five years. In 1912 he became a Professor of Chemistry at Harvard University, and there he stayed until a second retirement, in 1936. Throughout his career, Michael worked with some of the foremost chemists of his day, obtained chemistry professorships, and achieved fame among his peers. Arthur Michael died in Orlando, Florida on February 8, 1942. His wife died in 1904. They had no children. Work Arthur Michael is remembered today primarily for the Michael reaction, also called the Michael addition. As originally defined by Michael, the reaction involves the combination of an enolate ion of a ketone or aldehyde to an Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated carbonyl compound at the Œ≤ carbon. Michael was also well known in his day for incorporating thermodynamic concepts into organic chemistry, particularly for his use of entropy arguments. Perhaps his most enduring contribution to science was his central role in introducing the European model of graduate education into the United States. Activities and honors * National Academy of Sciences (1889) Arthur Michael is credited with the 1897 first ascents of Mount Lefroy and Mount Victoria in the Canadian Rockies along with J.

The three books are The Divide (2002), Back to The Divide (2005), and Jinx on The Divide (2006). The first novel was originally published by the small press publisher Chicken House (now a division of Scholastic), with subsequent volumes published by Scholastic, which also reprinted the first novel. The books have been translated into French, German, Spanish, Finnish, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Italian, Romanian and Dutch. Interior illustrations are by Ted Dewan. The Divide=Plot summary= A thirteen-year-old boy, Felix Sanders, has a life- threatening heart condition. While his family is vacationing in Costa Rica at a place called the Divide, the point where water flows to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, he passes out and he finds himself in alternate world, where the Earth's mythical creatures are real and humans are a legend. He sets off on a journey with residents of this world to cure his illness and get home. He meets a creature named Betony, a tangle-child (elf) who later becomes his lifelong best friend. Along with Betony and a (griffin) named Ironclaw they help him find a cure for his illness. Back to the Divide=Plot summary= Snakeweed, a character from the first novel who came from the alternate world, wants to return home, but in order to do so, he needs a spell hidden in Felix's notebook. In order to obtain the spell, Snakeweed turns Felix's parents into stone. The curse spreads, and Felix must head back across the Divide to find the counter charm and save the Earth. In this book, old friends return afresh and new enemies are discovered. A crisis almost mirrors the one in the real world in the alternate world: the king and queen are missing. Felix must now race against time in an attempt to rescue BOTH worlds, something not easily done, considering the risks. Jinx on the Divide=Plot summary= A bully, Rhino, at Felix's school accidentally releases a brandee (genie) from a lamp Felix obtained from across the Divide. The djinn demands to be returned home and to be given a solid form. Felix and Betony (who is spending Christmas with Felix across the Divide with Nimplenap, Betony's flying carpet), return to that world.

It differs from holiday allowance in that no prior notice is needed. Employees receive an allocation of days where if they do not want to go to work for any reason they can use a duvet day. The name is a reference to the item of bedding. Duvet days were originally given to employees by UK company August One Communications in 1997, and the idea has grown in popularity as some companies aim to address the changing work-life climate where people work longer hours. It can be stipulated formally in a contract of employment and is considered part of the remunerations package along with holiday allowance. The term has also since become used by people to reference taking a day off work for no normally accepted reason (such as mild sickness, grievance or holiday) even if they have no official duvet day entitlement with their employer. In the Indian subcontinent, this is historically called a casual leave. Employees usually are sanctioned a fixed number of days off (usually 12 per year for government and 8-12 for private employees). These days can be taken with or without planning. Since these leave days could not be accumulated or carried over into the next year, they would expire at the year end. This created a tendency to utilize all the left over casual leave in November and December. The Indian casual leave has been around for more than 50 years.

The fictional heroes are headquartered in San Francisco. Background The team and characters were introduced as the example superhero team in the Champions role-playing game.. At a 1985 San Diego Comic-Con panel featuring Champions RPG creators Steve Peterson, George MacDonald, and Ray Greer, an audience member asked when these characters were going to be adapted into comic-book form. The RPG creators had no plans for such a conversion at the time. However, Dennis Mallonee, who was already writing several Champions supplements, was in the audience and spoke up that he would be willing to write a Champions comic. Following the panel, Mallonee, Peterson, and MacDonald discussed terms for the series; among the key points were that all the characters would remain fully creator-owned, and that Mallonee would have creative control of the comic book. The series needed a publisher, and having heard from Mark Evanier that Eclipse Comics was looking to publish another team book, Mallonee pitched the series to Eclipse co- founder Dean Mullaney and editor-in-chief Catherine Yronwode. They were receptive to the idea, and so Mallonee picked out six Champions RPG characters he wanted to use for the superhero team and sent out requests to the characters' creators for permission to use them in the comic book. He obtained permission to use six: * Flare, Terri Feran, with the abilities of strength and photonic energy; created by Stacy Thain. * Icestar, John Grayson, with icing powers; created by Glenn Thain. * Rose, Julie Rich, whose psychic abilities are also accompanied by the scent of the flower for which she is named; created by Tom Tumey; later turned into Psyche in the comics * Marksman, Donald Henderson, a former soldier with enhanced reflexes and various weapons produced by the company he runs in civilian; created by Bruce Harlick; later turned into Donald Hunter, a.k.a. Huntsman, in the comics * Giant, who can increase his size and strength with a special harness he wears. * Superion, Shawn Jacobs, a mutant with super-strength, invulnerability, and flight. The sixth character he wanted to use was Gargoyle; creator Mark Williams refused permission because he had other plans for the character. However, he allowed the comic book to mention Gargoyle, an option which Mallonee made use of, since he had already come up with a backstory for Flare in which Gargoyle had an important part. Other Champions who were mentioned in the series, but not shown, are Transpower, Dove (not to be confused with the DC Comics character), and Nightwind (not to be confused with the Marvel Comics character). Mallonee's original plan for the series called for six issues of short solo stories which would develop the backgrounds and characters of the individual Champions, and in a subtle manner lead into the giant-sized Champions #7 and 8, in which the five heroes would unite as a team to battle the forces of Demon. However, Eclipse Comics felt this scheme ran contrary to their desire for a team book, and rejected it, telling Mallonee to instead write a six-issue series dealing solely with the team's conflict with Demon. Mallonee added one of his own Champions characters to the comic, a wheelchair- using man who had been a hero under the name of Doctor Arcane, solely as someone who would explain all the essential Demon backstory that would have otherwise been covered in the short solo stories. Publication history Champions #1 sold very well, but sales hit a sharp decline in other issues, and this convinced Eclipse to leave Champions as a six-issue limited series. Issue #2 introduced penciller Chris Marrinan and inker Dell Barras to the series; the trio of Mallonee, Marrinan, and Barras became the title's longest- running creative team. Mallonee founded comics-publishing company Hero Comics (later renamed Heroic Publishing), and included an ongoing Champions series in its launch lineup, with the first issue dated September 1987. The team was still also being used in the Champions role-playing game, for the first three editions, but creative differences caused a rift between Heroic Publishing and Hero Games, leading to the game using a different team in later editions, and several of the characters in the League of Champions comics being retconned to change names and other details because they had originated with creators associated with Hero Games: Rose became Psyche, Donald \\"Marksman\\" Henderson became Donald \\"Huntsman\\" Hunter, and a villain originally named Foxbat (created by Bruce Harlick and Mark Williams) became the Flying Fox. Hero/Heroic also spun off the character Flare into her own comics, Flare and Flare: First Edition, plus a Flare collectible card game. Marksman (before the Huntsman rename) also received a stand-alone self-titled series, The Marksman, but it was less successful and was short-lived. The superhero roster of the Champions (before they became the League of Champions) expanded in the seventh issue (vol. 2, March 1988) with the addition of Flare's sister Sparkplug, and Icestar's sister Icicle. Additional side material has also been published, including a series of Tales of the Champions specials. In 1992, the League of Champions and Flare were teamed up with the Southern Knights (originally published by Comics Interview) for a multi-part story called \\"The Morrigan Wars\\".

In December 2009 their time slot shifted from 5:30 to 9:00 to its current time. The show is produced in Ottawa, Ontario, and can be heard on the CFGO radio station in Ottawa (AM 1200), downloaded as a Podcast (note, podcast link does not work in Chrome), and streamed over the internet from the TSN 1200 website. History of the show Three Guys on the Radio began as the morning drive show on the Team 1200 after the acquisition by CHUM Limited and rebranding of \\"Ottawa Sports Radio 1200\\" to \\"Sports Radio 1200 The Team\\". The original cast of TGOR was Geoff Franklin, \\"Jungle\\" Jim Jerome, and John Rodenburg hosting, and shortly after, Steve Warne moved in to replace Rodenburg, who moved to the show \\"Sportscall.\\" A short time later, Franklin was let go, and John returned. Steve is the local Valley boy who actually plays most of the games he talks about. He is happily married to his wife Linda Warne, who works for Rogers Communications at Y101 in Ottawa. He has an autistic son and inspires parents of autistic children with occasional tales of perseverance and humour. Throughout the year he produces the parody songs for the Ottawa Senators, often lampooning ,ts including the Dirty Dozen, 61 second shootout, and many others. He also co-hosts a fitness, wealth management, closet organization show called Grecosize that runs from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM on Saturday mornings With , Tony Greco.

He left join the morning show at K-Rock CIRK-FM, Jerome's mother Barry Jerome (1931-2012), widow of former House of Commons Speaker James Jerome, appeared on Fridays to give her NFL picks of the week. Jim Jerome's claim to fame is a Gretzky sidekick from the 1980s and his unorthodox takes on the game of hockey, his ability to change any subject to golf, and his tongue in cheek references to women and sexual issues. He returned after Tim's death, from his house in Edmonton. He is often the butt of jokes, including his terrible attendance record and daffy takes. Under different ownership, his edge was sharper with more creative freedom in early hours of the show. With the ownership change from CHUM Limited to corporatist Bell Media, the show reduced the edgy sexual humour content. On Thursday, February 9, 2012 due to CTVGlobeMedia restructuring; Jim Jerome's hosting job was terminated. Jerome was quoted on the show as saying \\"it would be tough, but he'd be alright\\".https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/Bell+Media+fires+Ottawa+CFRA+Team+1200+Majic/6127948/story.html John Rodenburg recently returned to the show from 93.9 Bob FM in a trade that sent Stu Schwartz to 93.9 Bob FM in September 2009, Rodenburg's third time with the show.

The Ranch Wagon was a full-size model, except in 1963 and 1964, when it was part of the intermediate-size Fairlane series, and represented the lowest- priced selection in its respective line.  1952‚Äì1962  1959 Ford 2-door Ranch Wagon In the early 1950s, the era of the wood-bodied station wagon was coming to an end. When Ford introduced a redesigned line of cars for the 1952 model year, its Country Squire continued to cater to buyers who still wanted a station wagon with the look of wood (attained by applying simulated exterior wood decals, which were framed in genuine wood through 1953). But for other wagon buyers, Ford also gave them two new choices that year, the first all- steel wagons in the firm's history. These were the Country Sedan, a four-door model in the mid-range Customline series; and the Ranch Wagon, which was a two-door model in the economy Mainline series, inspired by the European-term shooting-brake. The Ranch Wagon ran with either the standard \\"Mileage Maker\\" six-cylinder engine or the long-familiar flathead V8, which was optional. After receiving mostly cosmetic changes for 1953, a second Ranch Wagon model, a slightly fancier version in the Customline series, was added for 1954, the year Ford's new Y-block V8 replaced the flathead unit. The two models were renamed Ranch Wagon and Custom Ranch Wagon for 1955, when the entire Ford station wagon set became a series of its own. For 1957, the Del Rio Ranch Wagon was introduced (replacing both the Custom Ranch Wagon and the Parklane), sporting special ranch-pattern upholstery. That same model was the basis for the new 1957 Ranchero, and a Mercury version called the Mercury Commuter which was a hardtop inspired wagon without a \\"B\\" pillar. There were three Ranch Wagons the following year, as the first four-door Ranch Wagon was added to the model range. The Del Rio was dropped for 1959, replaced by a one-year-only two-door Country Sedan. By this time, full-size two-door station wagons were fast fading in popularity, and the 1961 two-door Ranch Wagon was the last full-size two-door wagon ever built (along with the two-door Plymouth Deluxe Suburban of that same year), leaving the four-door as the sole Ranch Wagon model for 1962.  1963‚Äì1964  1963 Ford Fairlane 500 Custom Ranch Wagon In 1963 and 1964, no Ranch Wagon was included in Ford's full-size station wagon series,John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946‚Äì1975, Revised 4th Edition, pages 410 to 415 but the name was used for some station wagons in the intermediate-size Fairlane series. It was offered in the base and 500 trim levels, with the 500 also marketed as the \\"Custom Ranch Wagon\\". The 1963 models ran with a 200-cid six-cylinder or any of three optional V8 engines‚Äî221, 260- or 289-cid. The 221 was dropped for 1964.  1965‚Äì1974  1967 Ford Ranch Wagon 1972 Ford Ranch Wagon The Ranch Wagon returned to the full-size line for 1965. In 1966, it was the beneficiary of Ford's innovative new dual-action Magic Doorgate, which could be opened either down or sideways. In 1968, two new Ranch Wagon models, called the Custom 500 Ranch Wagons, were introduced; one a six-passenger model, the other the first Ranch Wagon furnished with third row seating, Ford's familiar side-mounted dual-facing rear seats. Ford wagons ceased to be a separate series when they were redesigned for 1969, officially becoming part of the respective series on which they were based; thus that year's base Ranch Wagon was now a member of the low-end Custom series. In 1970, for the first time, all Ranch Wagons were powered by a V8. A three-speed manual transmission continued as standard through the 1971 model year, with all cars fitted with a SelectShift automatic transmission starting with the 1972 models. The Custom series was dropped when Ford issued the next generation of full-size cars for 1973, meaning all Ranch Wagons were Custom 500s. The 1974 Ranch Wagon was the last available for sale to the general public. From 1975 to 1977, small quantities of Custom 500 station wagons (no longer called Ranch Wagon) were produced strictly for fleet buyers.

The war contained mainly skirmishes and feuds between the kings, and the only major battle was the indecisive Battle of Largs. Background Map of North Sea showing relative location of Scotland and Norway, in relation to Shetland, Orkney and Hebrides islands Both the Hebrides and the Isle of Man had come under Norwegian influence dating to the reign of King Harald Fairhair of Norway. Norwegian control had been formalised in 1098, when Edgar, King of Scotland signed the islands over to King Magnus III of Norway, setting the boundary between Scots and Norwegian claims in the west. The Scottish acceptance came after the Norwegian king had imposed more direct royal control over the Hebrides as well as Orkney and the Isle of Man in a swift campaign earlier the same year, directed against the local Norse-Gaelic leaders of the various islands. In Norwegian terms, the islands were the Su√∞reyjar, meaning Southern Isles. The Norwegian suzerainty over the Hebrides had been contested since the 1240s, when the Scottish king, Alexander II, began asking King Haakon IV of Norway if he could purchase the islands from him. For almost a decade these attempts were unsuccessful, and the negotiations ceased for thirteen years after Alexander II died. When his son, Alexander III, came to power in 1262 by obtaining majority support among the clansmen, he sent Haakon a final request saying that if Haakon did not sell them the islands they would take them by force. War (1262‚Äì1263) Haakon responded to this request by gathering a fleet of over 120 leidang warships and setting out in July 1263 to defend the Isles. Haakon stopped at the Isle of Arran where negotiations were started. Knowing Haakon had to win a decisive victory before the winter, Alexander III stalled during the negotiations until the autumn storms. In October 1263, several of Haakon's ships became stranded at Largs in stormy weather. A rescue party was sent ashore to help salvage the ships, where the Scottish forces launched a surprise attack, and a minor skirmish followed which ended indecisively. The following morning, Haakon's forces sailed back to Orkney for the winter, where he died in December. Haakon's successor, King Magnus VI of Norway, had problems at home and lacked the funding to launch a new expedition. Resolution Although the war was not really decided while Haakon was king, he was a major player in the events leading up to the conflict. Alexander III captured the Hebrides in 1264, and then made another formal claim to the islands which were bought from Norway for 4,000 marks, and 100 every year after under the terms of Treaty of Perth, by which the Scots at the same time recognised Norwegian rule over Shetland and Orkney.

He was a politician in colonial Massachusetts, a leader of the movement that became the American Revolution, and one of the architects of the principles of American republicanism that shaped the political culture of the United States. He was a second cousin to his fellow Founding Father, President John Adams. Adams was born in Boston, brought up in a religious and politically active family. A graduate of Harvard College, he was an unsuccessful businessman and tax collector before concentrating on politics. He was an influential official of the Massachusetts House of Representatives and the Boston Town Meeting in the 1760s, and he became a part of a movement opposed to the British Parliament's efforts to tax the British American colonies without their consent. His 1768 Massachusetts Circular Letter calling for colonial non-cooperation prompted the occupation of Boston by British soldiers, eventually resulting in the Boston Massacre of 1770. Adams and his colleagues devised a committee of correspondence system in 1772 to help coordinate resistance to what he saw as the British government's attempts to violate the British Constitution at the expense of the colonies, which linked like-minded Patriots throughout the Thirteen Colonies. Continued resistance to British policy resulted in the 1773 Boston Tea Party and the coming of the American Revolution. Parliament passed the Coercive Acts in 1774, at which time Adams attended the Continental Congress in Philadelphia which was convened to coordinate a colonial response. He helped guide Congress towards issuing the Continental Association in 1774 and the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and he helped draft the Articles of Confederation and the Massachusetts Constitution. Adams returned to Massachusetts after the American Revolution, where he served in the state senate and was eventually elected governor. Samuel Adams later became a controversial figure in American history. Accounts written in the 19th century praised him as someone who had been steering his fellow colonists towards independence long before the outbreak of the Revolutionary War. This view gave way to negative assessments of Adams in the first half of the 20th century, in which he was portrayed as a master of propaganda who provoked mob violence to achieve his goals. Both of these interpretations have been challenged by some modern scholars, who argue that these traditional depictions of Adams are myths contradicted by the historical record. Early life Samuel Adams was born in Boston in the British colony of Massachusetts on September 16, 1722, an Old Style date that is sometimes converted to the New Style date of September 27. Adams was one of twelve children born to Samuel Adams, Sr., and Mary (Fifield) Adams in an age of high infant mortality; only three of these children lived past their third birthday. Adams's parents were devout Puritans and members of the Old South Congregational Church. The family lived on Purchase Street in Boston. Adams was proud of his Puritan heritage, and emphasized Puritan values in his political career, especially virtue. Samuel Adams, Sr. (1689‚Äì1748) was a prosperous merchant and church deacon. Deacon Adams became a leading figure in Boston politics through an organization that became known as the Boston Caucus, which promoted candidates who supported popular causes. The Boston Caucus helped shape the agenda of the Boston Town Meeting. A New England town meeting is a form of local government with elected officials, and not just a gathering of citizens; according to historian William Fowler, it was \\"the most democratic institution in the British empire\\". Deacon Adams rose through the political ranks, becoming a justice of the peace, a selectman, and a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He worked closely with Elisha Cooke, Jr. (1678‚Äì1737), the leader of the \\"popular party\\", a faction that resisted any encroachment by royal officials on the colonial rights embodied in the Massachusetts Charter of 1691. In the coming years, members of the \\"popular party\\" became known as Whigs or Patriots. Massachusetts Hall. The younger Samuel Adams attended Boston Latin School and then entered Harvard College in 1736. His parents hoped that his schooling would prepare him for the ministry, but Adams gradually shifted his interest to politics. After graduating in 1740, Adams continued his studies, earning a master's degree in 1743. In his thesis, he argued that it was \\"lawful to resist the Supreme Magistrate, if the Commonwealth cannot otherwise be preserved\\", which indicated that his political views, like his father's, were oriented towards colonial rights. Adams's life was greatly affected by his father's involvement in a banking controversy. In 1739, Massachusetts was facing a serious currency shortage, and Deacon Adams and the Boston Caucus created a \\"land bank\\" which issued paper money to borrowers who mortgaged their land as security. The land bank was generally supported by the citizenry and the popular party, which dominated the House of Representatives, the lower branch of the General Court. Opposition to the land bank came from the more aristocratic \\"court party\\", who were supporters of the royal governor and controlled the Governor's Council, the upper chamber of the General Court. The court party used its influence to have the British Parliament dissolve the land bank in 1741. Directors of the land bank, including Deacon Adams, became personally liable for the currency still in circulation, payable in silver and gold. Lawsuits over the bank persisted for years, even after Deacon Adams's death, and the younger Samuel Adams often had to defend the family estate from seizure by the government. For Adams, these lawsuits \\"served as a constant personal reminder that Britain's power over the colonies could be exercised in arbitrary and destructive ways\\". Early career After leaving Harvard in 1743, Adams was unsure about his future. He considered becoming a lawyer but instead decided to go into business. He worked at Thomas Cushing's counting house, but the job only lasted a few months because Cushing felt that Adams was too preoccupied with politics to become a good merchant. Adams's father then lent him ¬£1,000 to go into business for himself, a substantial amount for that time. Adams's lack of business instincts were confirmed; he lent half of this money to a friend who never repaid, and frittered away the other half. Adams always remained, in the words of historian Pauline Maier, \\"a man utterly uninterested in either making or possessing money\\".Maier, American National Biography. The Old South Meeting House (1968 photo shown) was Adams's church. During the crisis with Great Britain, mass meetings were held here that were too large for Faneuil Hall. After Adams had lost his money, his father made him a partner in the family's malthouse, which was next to the family home on Purchase Street. Several generations of Adamses were maltsters, who produced the malt necessary for brewing beer. Years later, a poet poked fun at Adams by calling him \\"Sam the maltster\\". Adams has often been described as a brewer, but the extant evidence suggests that he worked as a maltster and not a brewer.Stoll (Samuel Adams, 275n16) notes that Jim Koch, founder of the Boston Beer Company, reports having been offered for purchase a receipt for hops signed by Adams, which indicates that Adams may have done some brewing. In January 1748, Adams and some friends were inflamed by British impressment and launched The Independent Advertiser, a weekly newspaper that printed many political essays written by Adams. His essays drew heavily upon English political theorist John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, and they emphasized many of the themes that characterized his subsequent career. He argued that the people must resist any encroachment on their constitutional rights. He cited the decline of the Roman Empire as an example of what could happen to New England if it were to abandon its Puritan values. When Deacon Adams died in 1748, Adams was given the responsibility of managing the family's affairs. In October 1749, he married Elizabeth Checkley, his pastor's daughter. Elizabeth gave birth to six children over the next seven years, but only two lived to adulthood: Samuel (born 1751) and Hannah (born 1756). In July 1757, Elizabeth died soon after giving birth to a stillborn son. Adams remarried in 1764 to Elizabeth Wells, but had no other children. Like his father, Adams embarked on a political career with the support of the Boston Caucus. He was elected to his first political office in 1747, serving as one of the clerks of the Boston market. In 1756, the Boston Town Meeting elected him to the post of tax collector, which provided a small income. He often failed to collect taxes from his fellow citizens, which increased his popularity among those who did not pay, but left him liable for the shortage. By 1765, his account was more than ¬£8,000 in arrears. The town meeting was on the verge of bankruptcy, and Adams was compelled to file suit against delinquent taxpayers, but many taxes went uncollected. In 1768, his political opponents used the situation to their advantage, obtaining a court judgment of ¬£1,463 against him. Adams's friends paid off some of the deficit, and the town meeting wrote off the remainder. By then, he had emerged as a leader of the popular party, and the embarrassing situation did not lessen his influence. Struggle with Great Britain Samuel Adams emerged as an important public figure in Boston soon after the British Empire's victory in the French and Indian War (1754‚Äì1763). The British Parliament found itself deep in debt and looking for new sources of revenue, and they sought to directly tax the colonies of British America for the first time. This tax dispute was part of a larger divergence between British and American interpretations of the British Constitution and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.Bailyn, Ideological Origins, 162. =Sugar Act= The first step in the new program was the Sugar Act of 1764, which Adams saw as an infringement of longstanding colonial rights. Colonists were not represented in Parliament, he argued, and therefore they could not be taxed by that body; the colonists were represented by the colonial assemblies, and only they could levy taxes upon them. Adams expressed these views in May 1764, when the Boston Town Meeting elected its representatives to the Massachusetts House. As was customary, the town meeting provided the representatives with a set of written instructions, which Adams was selected to write. Adams highlighted what he perceived to be the dangers of taxation without representation: > For if our Trade may be taxed, why not our Lands? Why not the Produce of our > Lands & everything we possess or make use of? This we apprehend annihilates > our Charter Right to govern & tax ourselves. It strikes at our British > privileges, which as we have never forfeited them, we hold in common with > our Fellow Subjects who are Natives of Britain. If Taxes are laid upon us in > any shape without our having a legal Representation where they are laid, are > we not reduced from the Character of free Subjects to the miserable State of > tributary Slaves?The complete text is in Cushing, Writings, 1:1‚Äì7. \\"When the Boston Town Meeting approved the Adams instructions on May 24, 1764,\\" writes historian John K. Alexander, \\"it became the first political body in America to go on record stating Parliament could not constitutionally tax the colonists. The directives also contained the first official recommendation that the colonies present a unified defense of their rights.\\" Adams's instructions were published in newspapers and pamphlets, and he soon became closely associated with James Otis, Jr., a member of the Massachusetts House famous for his defense of colonial rights. Otis boldly challenged the constitutionality of certain acts of Parliament, but he would not go as far as Adams, who was moving towards the conclusion that Parliament did not have sovereignty over the colonies. =Stamp Act= In 1765, Parliament passed the Stamp Act which required colonists to pay a new tax on most printed materials. News of the passage of the Stamp Act produced an uproar in the colonies. The colonial response echoed Adams's 1764 instructions. In June 1765, Otis called for a Stamp Act Congress to coordinate colonial resistance. The Virginia House of Burgesses passed a widely reprinted set of resolves against the Stamp Act that resembled Adams's arguments against the Sugar Act. Adams argued that the Stamp Act was unconstitutional; he also believed that it would hurt the economy of the British Empire. He supported calls for a boycott of British goods to put pressure on Parliament to repeal the tax. In Boston, a group called the Loyal Nine, a precursor to the Sons of Liberty, organized protests of the Stamp Act. Adams was friendly with the Loyal Nine but was not a member. On August 14, stamp distributor Andrew Oliver was hanged in effigy from Boston's Liberty Tree; that night, his home was ransacked and his office demolished. On August 26, lieutenant governor Thomas Hutchinson's home was destroyed by an angry crowd. Anne Whitney, Samuel Adams, bronze and granite statue, 1880, located in front of Faneuil Hall, which was the home of the Boston Town Meeting Officials such as Governor Francis Bernard believed that common people acted only under the direction of agitators and blamed the violence on Adams. This interpretation was revived by scholars in the early 20th century, who viewed Adams as a master of propaganda who manipulated mobs into doing his bidding. For example, historian John C. Miller wrote in 1936 in what became the standard biography of Adams that Adams \\"controlled\\" Boston with his \\"trained mob\\". Some modern scholars have argued that this interpretation is a myth, and that there is no evidence that Adams had anything to do with the Stamp Act riots. After the fact, Adams did approve of the August 14 action because he saw no other legal options to resist what he viewed as an unconstitutional act by Parliament, but he condemned attacks on officials' homes as \\"mobbish\\". According to the modern scholarly interpretation of Adams, he supported legal methods of resisting parliamentary taxation, such as petitions, boycotts, and nonviolent demonstrations, but he opposed mob violence which he saw as illegal, dangerous, and counter- productive. In September 1765, Adams was once again appointed by the Boston Town Meeting to write the instructions for Boston's delegation to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. As it turned out, he wrote his own instructions; on September 27, the town meeting selected him to replace the recently deceased Oxenbridge Thacher as one of Boston's four representatives in the assembly. James Otis was attending the Stamp Act Congress in New York City, so Adams was the primary author of a series of House resolutions against the Stamp Act, which were more radical than those passed by the Stamp Act Congress. Adams was one of the first colonial leaders to argue that mankind possessed certain natural rights that governments could not violate. The Stamp Act was scheduled to go into effect on November 1, 1765, but it was not enforced because protestors throughout the colonies had compelled stamp distributors to resign. Eventually, British merchants were able to convince Parliament to repeal the tax. By May 16, 1766, news of the repeal had reached Boston. There was celebration throughout the city, and Adams made a public statement of thanks to British merchants for helping their cause. The Massachusetts popular party gained ground in the May 1766 elections. Adams was re-elected to the House and selected as its clerk, in which position he was responsible for official House papers. In the coming years, Adams used his position as clerk to great effect in promoting his political message. Joining Adams in the House was John Hancock, a new representative from Boston. Hancock was a wealthy merchant‚Äîperhaps the richest man in Massachusetts‚Äîbut a relative newcomer to politics. He was initially a prot√©g√© of Adams, and he used his wealth to promote the Whig cause.Nobles, \\"Old Republicans\\", 269. =Townshend Acts= After the repeal of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a different approach to raising revenue, passing the Townshend Acts in 1767 which established new duties on various goods imported into the colonies. These duties were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose tariffs on the colonies before raising them. Revenues from these duties were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control. To enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a customs agency known as the American Board of Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston. Resistance to the Townshend Acts grew slowly. The General Court was not in session when news of the acts reached Boston in October 1767. Adams therefore used the Boston Town Meeting to organize an economic boycott, and called for other towns to do the same. By February 1768, towns in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut had joined the boycott. Opposition to the Townshend Acts was also encouraged by Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, a series of popular essays by John Dickinson which started appearing in December 1767. Dickinson's argument that the new taxes were unconstitutional had been made before by Adams, but never to such a wide audience. In January 1768, the Massachusetts House sent a petition to King George asking for his help.In London, the petition to the king was published, along with other documents, by Thomas Hollis under the title \\"The True Sentiments of America\\" Adams and Otis requested that the House send the petition to the other colonies, along with what became known as the Massachusetts Circular Letter, which became \\"a significant milestone on the road to revolution\\". The letter written by Adams called on the colonies to join with Massachusetts in resisting the Townshend Acts. The House initially voted against sending the letter and petition to the other colonies but, after some politicking by Adams and Otis, it was approved on February 11. British colonial secretary Lord Hillsborough, hoping to prevent a repeat of the Stamp Act Congress, instructed the colonial governors in America to dissolve the assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also directed Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to have the Massachusetts House rescind the letter. On June 30, the House refused to rescind the letter by a vote of 92 to 17, with Adams citing their right to petition as justification. Far from complying with the governor's order, Adams instead presented a new petition to the king asking that Governor Bernard be removed from office. Bernard responded by dissolving the legislature. The commissioners of the Customs Board found that they were unable to enforce trade regulations in Boston, so they requested military assistance. Help came in the form of , a fifty-gun warship which arrived in Boston Harbor in May 1768. Tensions escalated after the captain of Romney began to impress local sailors. The situation exploded on June 10, when customs officials seized , a sloop owned by John Hancock‚Äîa leading critic of the Customs Board‚Äîfor alleged customs violations. Sailors and marines came ashore from Romney to tow away Liberty, and a riot broke out. Things calmed down in the following days, but fearful customs officials packed up their families and fled for protection to Romney and eventually to Castle William, an island fort in the harbor. Governor Bernard wrote to London in response to the Liberty incident and the struggle over the Circular Letter, informing his superiors that troops were needed in Boston to restore order. Lord Hillsborough ordered four regiments of the British Army to Boston. =Boston under occupation= alt=A wide view of a port town with several wharves.

The skyline of the town, with nine tall spires and many smaller buildings, is in the distance. A key at the bottom of the drawing indicates some prominent landmarks and the names of the warships. Learning that British troops were on the way, the Boston Town Meeting met on September 12, 1768, and requested that Governor Bernard convene the General Court. Bernard refused, so the town meeting called on the other Massachusetts towns to send representatives to meet at Faneuil Hall beginning on September 22. About 100 towns sent delegates to the convention, which was effectively an unofficial session of the Massachusetts House. The convention issued a letter which insisted that Boston was not a lawless town, using language more moderate than what Adams desired, and that the impending military occupation violated Bostonians' natural, constitutional, and charter rights. By the time that the convention adjourned, British troop transports had arrived in Boston Harbor. Two regiments disembarked in October 1768, followed by two more in November. According to some accounts, the occupation of Boston was a turning point for Adams, after which he gave up hope of reconciliation and secretly began to work towards American independence. However, historian Carl Becker wrote in 1928 that \\"there is no clear evidence in his contemporary writings that such was the case.\\"Becker, \\"Samuel Adams\\". Dictionary of American Biography. Nevertheless, the traditional, standard view of Adams is that he desired independence before most of his contemporaries and steadily worked towards this goal for years. Historian Pauline Maier challenged that idea in 1980, arguing instead that Adams, like most of his peers, did not embrace independence until after the American Revolutionary War had begun in 1775.Notes that Stewart Beach's Samuel Adams, the Fateful Years (1965) also questioned whether Adams sought independence before the mid-1770s. According to Maier, Adams at this time was a reformer rather than a revolutionary; he sought to have the British ministry change its policies, and warned Britain that independence would be the inevitable result of a failure to do so. Adams wrote numerous letters and essays in opposition to the occupation, which he considered a violation of the 1689 Bill of Rights. The occupation was publicized throughout the colonies in the Journal of Occurrences, an unsigned series of newspaper articles that may have been written by Adams in collaboration with others. The Journal presented what it claimed to be a factual daily account of events in Boston during the military occupation, an innovative approach in an era without professional newspaper reporters. It depicted a Boston besieged by unruly British soldiers who assaulted men and raped women with regularity and impunity, drawing upon the traditional Anglo- American distrust of standing armies garrisoned among civilians. The Journal ceased publication on August 1, 1769, which was a day of celebration in Boston: Governor Bernard had left Massachusetts, never to return. Adams continued to work on getting the troops withdrawn and keeping the boycott going until the Townshend duties were repealed. Two regiments were removed from Boston in 1769, but the other two remained. Tensions between soldiers and civilians eventually resulted in the killing of five civilians in the Boston Massacre of March 1770. According to the \\"propagandist interpretation\\" of Adams popularized by historian John Miller, Adams deliberately provoked the incident to promote his secret agenda of American independence. According to Pauline Maier, however, \\"There is no evidence that he prompted the Boston Massacre riot\\". After the Boston Massacre, Adams and other town leaders met with Bernard's successor Governor Thomas Hutchinson and with Colonel William Dalrymple, the army commander, to demand the withdrawal of the troops. The situation remained explosive, and so Dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to Castle William. Adams wanted the soldiers to have a fair trial, because this would show that Boston was not controlled by a lawless mob, but was instead the victim of an unjust occupation. He convinced his cousins John Adams and Josiah Quincy to defend the soldiers, knowing that those Whigs would not slander Boston to gain an acquittal. However, Adams wrote essays condemning the outcome of the trials; he thought that the soldiers should have been convicted of murder. =\\"Quiet period\\"= After the Boston Massacre, politics in Massachusetts entered what is sometimes known as the \\"quiet period\\". In April 1770, Parliament repealed the Townshend duties, except for the tax on tea. Adams urged colonists to keep up the boycott of British goods, arguing that paying even one small tax allowed Parliament to establish the precedent of taxing the colonies, but the boycott faltered. As economic conditions improved, support waned for Adams's causes. In 1770, New York City and Philadelphia abandoned the non-importation boycott of British goods and Boston merchants faced the risk of being economically ruined, so they also agreed to end the boycott, effectively defeating Adams's cause in Massachusetts. John Adams withdrew from politics, while John Hancock and James Otis appeared to become more moderate. In 1771, Samuel Adams ran for the position of Register of Deeds, but he was beaten by Ezekiel Goldthwait by more than two to one.Hassam, John T. Registers of Deeds for the County of Suffolk, Massachusetts, 1735-1900, pp. 14‚Äì28, John Wilson & Son, University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1900.Goldthwaite, Charlotte. Descendants of Thomas Goldthwaite, pp. 84‚Äì87, Hartford Press, The Case, Lookwood & Brainard Company, 1899. He was re-elected to the Massachusetts House in April 1772, but he received far fewer votes than ever before. Samuel Adams as he looked in 1795 when he was Governor of Massachusetts. The original portrait was destroyed by fire; this is a alt=An older man, seated, with a hint of a smile. He has white hair and is wearing a dark suit. He is pointing to a document on a table. A struggle over the power of the purse brought Adams back into the political limelight. Traditionally, the Massachusetts House of Representatives paid the salaries of the governor, lieutenant governor, and superior court judges. From the Whig perspective, this arrangement was an important check on executive power, keeping royally appointed officials accountable to democratically elected representatives. In 1772, Massachusetts learned that those officials would henceforth be paid by the British government rather than by the province. To protest this, Adams and his colleagues devised a system of committees of correspondence in November 1772; the towns of Massachusetts would consult with each other concerning political matters via messages sent through a network of committees that recorded British activities and protested imperial policies. Committees of correspondence soon formed in other colonies, as well. Governor Hutchinson became concerned that the committees of correspondence were growing into an independence movement, so he convened the General Court in January 1773. Addressing the legislature, Hutchinson argued that denying the supremacy of Parliament, as some committees had done, came dangerously close to rebellion. \\"I know of no line that can be drawn\\", he said, \\"between the supreme authority of Parliament and the total independence of the colonies.\\" Adams and the House responded that the Massachusetts Charter did not establish Parliament's supremacy over the province, and so Parliament could not claim that authority now. Hutchinson soon realized that he had made a major blunder by initiating a public debate about independence and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies. The Boston Committee of Correspondence published its statement of colonial rights, along with Hutchinson's exchange with the Massachusetts House, in the widely distributed \\"Boston Pamphlet\\". The quiet period in Massachusetts was over. Adams was easily re-elected to the Massachusetts House in May 1773, and was also elected as moderator of the Boston Town Meeting. In June 1773, he introduced a set of private letters to the Massachusetts House, written by Hutchinson several years earlier. In one letter, Hutchinson recommended to London that there should be \\"an abridgement of what are called English liberties\\" in Massachusetts. Hutchinson denied that this is what he meant, but his career was effectively over in Massachusetts, and the House sent a petition asking the king to recall him.Hutchinson maintained that he was predicting a curtailment of liberty, rather than recommending it; for the modern scholarly analysis of the letters affair, see Bernard Bailyn, The Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson (Cambridge, 1974). =Tea Party= Adams took a leading role in the events that led up to the famous Boston Tea Party of December 16, 1773, although the precise nature of his involvement has been disputed. In May 1773, the British Parliament passed the Tea Act, a tax law to help the struggling East India Company, one of Great Britain's most important commercial institutions. Britons could buy smuggled Dutch tea more cheaply than the East India Company's tea because of the heavy taxes imposed on tea imported into Great Britain, and so the company amassed a huge surplus of tea that it could not sell.Thomas, Townshend Duties, 248‚Äì49 The British government's solution to the problem was to sell the surplus in the colonies. The Tea Act permitted the East India Company to export tea directly to the colonies for the first time, bypassing most of the merchants who had previously acted as middlemen. This measure was a threat to the American colonial economy because it granted the Tea Company a significant cost advantage over local tea merchants and even local tea smugglers, driving them out of business. The act also reduced the taxes on tea paid by the company in Britain, but kept the controversial Townshend duty on tea imported in the colonies. A few merchants in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Charlestown were selected to receive the company's tea for resale. In late 1773, seven ships were sent to the colonies carrying East India Company tea, including four bound for Boston. News of the Tea Act set off a firestorm of protest in the colonies. This was not a dispute about high taxes; the price of legally imported tea was actually reduced by the Tea Act. Protesters were instead concerned with a variety of other issues. The familiar \\"no taxation without representation\\" argument remained prominent, along with the question of the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.Thomas, Townshend Duties, 246. Some colonists worried that, by buying the cheaper tea, they would be conceding that Parliament had the right to tax them. The \\"power of the purse\\" conflict was still at issue. The tea tax revenues were to be used to pay the salaries of certain royal officials, making them independent of the people. Colonial smugglers played a significant role in the protests, since the Tea Act made legally imported tea cheaper, which threatened to put smugglers of Dutch tea out of business.See also John W. Tyler, Smugglers & Patriots: Boston Merchants and the Advent of the American Revolution (Boston, 1986). Legitimate tea importers who had not been named as consignees by the East India Company were also threatened with financial ruin by the Tea Act,Thomas, Townshend Duties, 256. and other merchants worried about the precedent of a government-created monopoly. This iconic 1846 lithograph by Nathaniel Currier was entitled \\"The Destruction of Tea at Boston Harbor\\"; the phrase \\"Boston Tea Party\\" had not yet become standard.Alfred F. Young, The Shoemaker and the Tea Party: Memory and the American Revolution (Boston: Beacon Press, 1999; ; ), 183‚Äì85. Adams and the correspondence committees promoted opposition to the Tea Act. In every colony except Massachusetts, protesters were able to force the tea consignees to resign or to return the tea to England. In Boston, however, Governor Hutchinson was determined to hold his ground. He convinced the tea consignees, two of whom were his sons, not to back down. The Boston Caucus and then the Town Meeting attempted to compel the consignees to resign, but they refused. With the tea ships about to arrive, Adams and the Boston Committee of Correspondence contacted nearby committees to rally support. The tea ship Dartmouth arrived in the Boston Harbor in late November, and Adams wrote a circular letter calling for a mass meeting to be held at Faneuil Hall on November 29. Thousands of people arrived, so many that the meeting was moved to the larger Old South Meeting House.This was not an official town meeting, but a gathering of \\"the body of the people\\" of greater Boston British law required the Dartmouth to unload and pay the duties within twenty days or customs officials could confiscate the cargo. The mass meeting passed a resolution introduced by Adams urging the captain of the Dartmouth to send the ship back without paying the import duty. Meanwhile, the meeting assigned twenty-five men to watch the ship and prevent the tea from being unloaded. Governor Hutchinson refused to grant permission for the Dartmouth to leave without paying the duty. Two more tea ships arrived in Boston Harbor, the Eleanor and the Beaver. The fourth ship, the William, was stranded near Cape Cod and never arrived to Boston. December 16 was the last day of the Dartmouth's deadline, and about 7,000 people gathered around the Old South Meeting House. Adams received a report that Governor Hutchinson had again refused to let the ships leave, and he announced, \\"This meeting can do nothing further to save the country.\\" According to a popular story, Adams's statement was a prearranged signal for the \\"tea party\\" to begin. However, this claim did not appear in print until nearly a century after the event, in a biography of Adams written by his great-grandson, who apparently misinterpreted the evidence. According to eyewitness accounts, people did not leave the meeting until ten or fifteen minutes after Adams's alleged \\"signal\\", and Adams in fact tried to stop people from leaving because the meeting was not yet over.For firsthand accounts that contradict the story that Adams gave the signal for the tea party, see L. F. S. Upton, ed., \\"Proceeding of Ye Body Respecting the Tea\\", William and Mary Quarterly, Third Series, 22 (1965), 297‚Äì98; Francis S. Drake, Tea Leaves: Being a Collection of Letters and Documents, (Boston, 1884), LXX; Boston Evening Post, December 20, 1773; Boston Gazette, December 20, 1773; Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News-Letter, December 23, 1773. While Adams tried to reassert control of the meeting, people poured out of the Old South Meeting House and headed to Boston Harbor. That evening, a group of 30 to 130 men boarded the three vessels, some of them thinly disguised as Mohawk Indians, and dumped all 342 chests of tea into the water over the course of three hours. Adams never revealed whether he went to the wharf to witness the destruction of the tea. Whether or not he helped plan the event is unknown, but Adams immediately worked to publicize and defend it. He argued that the Tea Party was not the act of a lawless mob, but was instead a principled protest and the only remaining option that the people had to defend their constitutional rights. Revolution Great Britain responded to the Boston Tea Party in 1774 with the Coercive Acts. The first of these acts was the Boston Port Act, which closed Boston's commerce until the East India Company had been repaid for the destroyed tea. The Massachusetts Government Act rewrote the Massachusetts Charter, making many officials royally appointed rather than elected, and severely restricting the activities of town meetings. The Administration of Justice Act allowed colonists charged with crimes to be transported to another colony or to Great Britain for trial. A new royal governor was appointed to enforce the acts: General Thomas Gage, who was also commander of British military forces in North America. Adams worked to coordinate resistance to the Coercive Acts. In May 1774, the Boston Town Meeting (with Adams serving as moderator) organized an economic boycott of British goods. In June, Adams headed a committee in the Massachusetts House‚Äîwith the doors locked to prevent Gage from dissolving the legislature‚Äîwhich proposed that an inter-colonial congress meet in Philadelphia in September. He was one of five delegates chosen to attend the First Continental Congress. Adams was never fashionably dressed and had little money, so friends bought him new clothes and paid his expenses for the journey to Philadelphia, his first trip outside of Massachusetts. =First Continental Congress= Adams as portrayed by Paul Revere, 1774. Yale University Art Gallery. In Philadelphia, Adams promoted colonial unity while using his political skills to lobby other delegates. On September 16, messenger Paul Revere brought Congress the Suffolk Resolves, one of many resolutions passed in Massachusetts that promised strident resistance to the Coercive Acts. Congress endorsed the Suffolk Resolves, issued a Declaration of Rights that denied Parliament's right to legislate for the colonies, and organized a colonial boycott known as the Continental Association. Adams returned to Massachusetts in November 1774, where he served in the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, an extralegal legislative body independent of British control. The Provincial Congress created the first minutemen companies, consisting of militiamen who were to be ready for action on a moment's notice. Adams also served as moderator of the Boston Town Meeting, which convened despite the Massachusetts Government Act, and was appointed to the Committee of Inspection to enforce the Continental Association. He was also selected to attend the Second Continental Congress, scheduled to meet in Philadelphia in May 1775. John Hancock had been added to the delegation, and he and Adams attended the Provincial Congress in Concord, Massachusetts, before Adams's journey to the second Congress. The two men decided that it was not safe to return to Boston before leaving for Philadelphia, so they stayed at Hancock's childhood home in Lexington.Fischer, Paul Revere's Ride, 94, 108. On April 14, 1775, General Gage received a letter from Lord Dartmouth advising him \\"to arrest the principal actors and abettors in the Provincial Congress whose proceedings appear in every light to be acts of treason and rebellion\\".Fischer, Paul Revere's Ride, 76; Alden, \\"March to Concord\\", 451. On the night of April 18, Gage sent out a detachment of soldiers on the fateful mission that sparked the American Revolutionary War. The purpose of the British expedition was to seize and destroy military supplies that the colonists had stored in Concord. According to many historical accounts, Gage also instructed his men to arrest Hancock and Adams, but the written orders issued by Gage made no mention of arresting the Patriot leaders.Alden, \\"March to Concord\\", 453. Gage had evidently decided against seizing Adams and Hancock, but Patriots initially believed otherwise, perhaps influenced by London newspapers that reached Boston with the news that the patriot leader would be hanged if he were caught.Burgan, Patriot and Statesman, 11 From Boston, Joseph Warren dispatched Paul Revere to warn the two that British troops were on the move and might attempt to arrest them.Fischer, Paul Revere's Ride, 110. As Hancock and Adams made their escape, the first shots of the war began at Lexington and Concord. Soon after the battle, Gage issued a proclamation granting a general pardon to all who would \\"lay down their arms, and return to the duties of peaceable subjects\\"‚Äîwith the exceptions of Hancock and Samuel Adams.The text of Gage's proclamation is available online from the Library of Congress. Singling out Hancock and Adams in this manner only added to their renown among Patriots and, according to Patriot historian Mercy Otis Warren, perhaps exaggerated the importance of the two men. =Second Continental Congress= In John Trumbull's Declaration of Independence, Adams is seated to the viewer's right of Richard Henry Lee, whose legs are crossed in the front row. The Continental Congress worked under a secrecy rule, so Adams's precise role in congressional deliberations is not fully documented. He appears to have had a major influence, working behind the scenes as a sort of \\"parliamentary whip\\"Nobles, \\"Old Republicans\\", 264, citing Jack N. Rakove, The Beginnings of National Politics: An Interpretive History of the Continental Congress (New York 1979), 103. and Thomas Jefferson credits Samuel Adams‚Äîthe lesser-remembered Adams‚Äîwith steering the Congress toward independence, saying, \\"If there was any Palinurus to the Revolution, Samuel Adams was the man.\\"Randall, Henry Stephens, The Life of Thomas Jefferson, J. B. Lippincott, 1871, p. 182 He served on numerous committees, often dealing with military matters. Among his more noted acts, Adams nominated George Washington to be commander in chief over the Continental Army. Adams was a cautious advocate for a declaration of independence, urging eager correspondents back in Massachusetts to wait for more moderate colonists to come around to supporting separation from Great Britain. He was pleased in 1775 when the colonies began to replace their old governments with independent republican governments. He praised Thomas Paine's popular pamphlet Common Sense, writing as \\"Candidus\\" in early 1776, and supported the call for American independence. On June 7, Adams's political ally Richard Henry Lee introduced a three-part resolution calling for Congress to declare independence, create a colonial confederation, and seek foreign aid. After a delay to rally support, Congress approved the language of the United States Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, which Adams signed. After the Declaration of Independence, Congress continued to manage the war effort. Adams served on military committees, including an appointment to the Board of War in 1777. He advocated paying bonuses to Continental Army soldiers to encourage them to reenlist for the duration of the war. He called for harsh state legislation to punish Loyalists‚ÄîAmericans who continued to support the British crown‚Äîwho Adams believed were as dangerous to American liberty as British soldiers. In Massachusetts, more than 300 Loyalists were banished and their property confiscated. After the war, Adams opposed allowing Loyalists to return to Massachusetts, fearing that they would work to undermine republican government. Adams was the Massachusetts delegate appointed to the committee to draft the Articles of Confederation, the plan for the colonial confederation. With its emphasis on state sovereignty, the Articles reflected Congress's wariness of a strong central government, a concern shared by Adams. Like others at the time, Adams considered himself a citizen of the United States while continuing to refer to Massachusetts as his \\"country\\". After much debate, the Articles were sent to the states for ratification in November 1777. From Philadelphia, Adams urged Massachusetts to ratify, which it did. Adams signed the Articles of Confederation with the other Massachusetts delegates in 1778, but they were not ratified by all the states until 1781. Adams returned to Boston in 1779 to attend a state constitutional convention. The Massachusetts General Court had proposed a new constitution the previous year, but voters rejected it, and so a convention was held to try again. Adams was appointed to a three-man drafting committee with his cousin John Adams and James Bowdoin. They drafted the Massachusetts Constitution, which was amended by the convention and approved by voters in 1780. The new constitution established a republican form of government, with annual elections and a separation of powers. It reflected Adams's belief that \\"a state is never free except when each citizen is bound by no law whatever that he has not approved of, either directly, or through his representatives\\". By modern standards, the new constitution was not \\"democratic\\"; Adams, like most of his peers, believed that only free males who owned property should be allowed to vote, and that the senate and the governor served to balance any excesses that might result from majority rule. In 1781, Adams retired from the Continental Congress. His health was one reason; he was approaching his sixtieth birthday and suffered from tremors that made writing difficult. But he also wanted to return to Massachusetts to influence politics in the Commonwealth. He returned to Boston in 1781, and never left Massachusetts again. Return to Massachusetts Adams remained active in politics upon his return to Massachusetts. He frequently served as moderator of the Boston Town Meeting, and was elected to the state senate, where he often served as that body's president. Adams focused his political agenda on promoting virtue, which he considered essential in a republican government. If republican leaders lacked virtue, he believed, liberty was endangered. His major opponent in this campaign was his former prot√©g√© John Hancock; the two men had a falling out in the Continental Congress. Adams disapproved of what he viewed as Hancock's vanity and extravagance, which Adams believed were inappropriate in a republican leader. When Hancock left Congress in 1777, Adams and the other Massachusetts delegates voted against thanking him for his service as president of Congress. The struggle continued in Massachusetts. Adams thought that Hancock was not acting the part of a virtuous republican leader by acting like an aristocrat and courting popularity. Adams favored James Bowdoin for governor, and was distressed when Hancock won annual landslide victories. Adams's promotion of public virtue took several forms. He played a major role in getting Boston to provide a free public education for children, even for girls, which was controversial. Adams was one of the charter members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780. After the Revolutionary War, Adams joined others, including Thomas Jefferson, in denouncing the Society of the Cincinnati, an organization of former army officers. Adams worried that the Society was \\"a stride towards an hereditary military nobility\\", and thus a threat to republicanism. Adams also believed that public theaters undermined civic virtue, and he joined an ultimately unsuccessful effort to keep theaters banned in Boston. Decades after Adams's death, orator Edward Everett called him \\"the last of the Puritans\\". Postwar economic troubles in western Massachusetts led to an uprising known as Shays's Rebellion, which began in 1786. Small farmers, angered by high taxes and debts, armed themselves and shut down debtor courts in two counties. Governor James Bowdoin sent four thousand militiamen to put down the uprising, an action supported by Adams. His old political ally James Warren thought that Adams had forsaken his principles, but Adams saw no contradiction. He approved of rebellion against an unrepresentative government, as had happened during the American Revolution, but he opposed taking up arms against a republican government, where problems should be remedied through elections. He thought that the leaders of Shays's Rebellion should be hanged, reportedly saying that \\"the man who dares to rebel against the laws of a republic ought to suffer death\\". Shays's Rebellion contributed to the belief that the Articles of Confederation needed to be revised. In 1787, delegates to the Philadelphia Convention, instead of revising the Articles, created a new United States Constitution with a much stronger national government. The Constitution was sent to the states for ratification, when Adams expressed his displeasure. \\"I confess,\\" he wrote to Richard Henry Lee in 1787, \\"as I enter the Building I stumble at the Threshold. I meet with a National Government, instead of a Federal Union of States.\\" Adams was one of those derisively labeled \\"Anti-Federalists\\" by proponents of the new Constitution, who called themselves \\"Federalists\\". Adams was elected to the Massachusetts ratifying convention which met in January 1788. Despite his reservations, Adams rarely spoke at the convention, and listened carefully to the arguments rather than raising objections. Adams and John Hancock had reconciled, and they finally agreed to give their support for the Constitution, with the proviso that some amendments be added later. Even with the support of Hancock and Adams, the Massachusetts convention narrowly ratified the Constitution by a vote of 187 to 168. While Adams was attending the ratifying convention, his only son Samuel Adams, Jr. died at just 37 years of age. The younger Adams had served as surgeon in the Revolutionary War, but had fallen ill and never fully recovered. The death was a stunning blow to the elder Adams. The younger Adams left his father the certificates that he had earned as a soldier, giving Adams and his wife unexpected financial security in their final years. Investments in land made them relatively wealthy by the mid-1790s, but this did not alter their frugal lifestyle. Adams was concerned about the new Constitution and made an attempt to re-enter national politics. He allowed his name to be put forth as a candidate for the United States House of Representatives in the December 1788 election, but lost to Fisher Ames, apparently because Ames was a stronger supporter of the Constitution, a more popular position. Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for amendments to the Constitution, a movement that ultimately resulted in the addition of a Bill of Rights in 1791. Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of the Constitution, with these amendments and the possibility of more. In 1789, Adams was elected Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts and served in that office until Governor Hancock's death in 1793, when he became acting governor. The next year, Adams was elected as governor in his own right, the first of four annual terms. He was generally regarded as the leader of his state's Jeffersonian Republicans, who were opposed to the Federalist Party. Unlike some other Republicans, Adams supported the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 for the same reasons that he had opposed Shays's Rebellion. Like his fellow Republicans, he spoke out against the Jay Treaty in 1796, a position that drew criticism in a state that was increasingly Federalist. In that year's U. S. presidential election, Republicans in Virginia cast 15 electoral votes for Adams in an effort to make him Jefferson's vice-president, but Federalist John Adams won the election, with Jefferson becoming vice- president. The Adams cousins remained friends, but Samuel was pleased when Jefferson defeated John Adams in the 1800 presidential election. Samuel Adams took a cue from President Washington, who declined to run for reelection in 1796: he retired from politics at the end of his term as governor in 1797. Adams suffered from what is now believed to have been essential tremor, a movement disorder that rendered him unable to write in the final decade of his life. He died at the age of 81 on October 2, 1803, and was interred at the Granary Burying Ground in Boston. Boston's Republican newspaper the Independent Chronicle eulogized him as the \\"Father of the American Revolution\\". Legacy alt=A rectangular, rough-hewn block of stone on the ground. There is a walkway in the foreground, grass and trees in the background. A weathered plaque on the stone reads: \\"Samuel Adams, Signer of the Declaration of Independence, Governor of this Commonwealth, A Leader of Men and an ardent Patriot.\\" Samuel Adams is a controversial figure in American history. Disagreement about his significance and reputation began before his death and continues to the present. Adams's contemporaries, both friends and foes, regarded him as one of the foremost leaders of the American Revolution. Thomas Jefferson, for example, characterized Adams as \\"truly the Man of the Revolution.\\" Leaders in other colonies were compared to him; Cornelius Harnett was called the \\"Samuel Adams of North Carolina\\", Charles Thomson the \\"Samuel Adams of Philadelphia\\", and Christopher Gadsden the \\"Sam Adams of the South\\".E. Stanly Godbold, \\"Gadsden, Christopher\\"; American National Biography Online, February 2000. When John Adams traveled to France during the Revolution, he had to explain that he was not Samuel, \\"the famous Adams\\". Supporters of the Revolution praised Adams, but Loyalists viewed him as a sinister figure. Peter Oliver, the exiled chief justice of Massachusetts, characterized him as a devious Machiavellian with a \\"cloven Foot\\". Thomas Hutchinson, Adams's political foe, took his revenge in his History of Massachusetts Bay, in which he denounced him as a dishonest character assassin, emphasizing his failures as a businessman and tax collector. This hostile \\"Tory interpretation\\" of Adams was revived in the 20th century by historian Clifford K. Shipton in the Sibley's Harvard Graduates reference series. Shipton wrote positive portraits of Hutchinson and Oliver and scathing sketches of Adams and Hancock; his entry on Adams was characterized by historian Pauline Maier as \\"forty-five pages of contempt\\". Whig historians challenged the \\"Tory interpretation\\" of Adams. William Gordon and Mercy Otis Warren, two historians who knew Adams, wrote of him as a man selflessly dedicated to the American Revolution. But in the early 19th century, Adams was often viewed as an old-fashioned Puritan, and was consequently neglected by historians. Interest in Adams was revived in the mid-19th century. Historian George Bancroft portrayed him favorably in his monumental History of the United States from the Discovery of the American Continent (1852). The first full biography of Adams appeared in 1865, a three-volume work written by William Wells, his great-grandson. The Wells biography is still valuable for its wealth of information, although Whig portrayals of Adams were uncritically pro-American and had elements of hagiography, a view that influenced some later biographies written for general audiences. In the late 19th century, many American historians were uncomfortable with contemporary revolutions and found it problematic to write approvingly about Adams. Relations had improved between the United States and the United Kingdom, and Adams's role in dividing Americans from Britons was increasingly viewed with regret. In 1885, James Hosmer wrote a biography that praised Adams, but also found some of his actions troubling, such as the 1773 publication of Hutchinson's private letters. Subsequent biographers became increasingly hostile towards Adams and the common people whom he represented. In 1923, Ralph V. Harlow used a \\"Freudian\\" approach to characterize Adams as a \\"neurotic crank\\" driven by an \\"inferiority complex\\".See Ralph V. Harlow, Samuel Adams, Promoter of the American Revolution: A Study in Psychology and Politics (Holt, 1923). Harlow argued that, because the masses were easily misled, Adams \\"manufactured public opinion\\" to produce the Revolution, a view that became the thesis of John C. Miller's 1936 biography Sam Adams: Pioneer in Propaganda. Miller portrayed Adams more as an incendiary revolutionary than an adroit political operative, attributing to this one man all the acts of Boston's \\"body of the people\\", and consistently calling his subject \\"Sam\\", despite the fact that Adams was almost always known as \\"Samuel\\" in his lifetime. Miller's influential book became, in the words of historian Charles Akers, the \\"scholarly enshrinement\\" of \\"the myth of Sam Adams as the Boston dictator who almost single-handedly led his colony into rebellion\\".Akers, \\"Sam Adams ‚Äì And Much More\\", 120‚Äì21. According to Akers, Miller and other historians used \\"Sam did it\\" to explain crowd actions and other developments, without citing any evidence that Adams directed those events.Akers, \\"Sam Adams ‚Äì And Much More\\", 121‚Äì22. In 1974, Akers called on historians to critically re-examine the sources rather than simply repeating the myth.Akers, \\"Sam Adams ‚Äì And Much More\\", 130. By then, scholars were increasingly rejecting the notion that Adams and others used \\"propaganda\\" to incite \\"ignorant mobs\\", and were instead portraying a revolutionary Massachusetts too complex to have been controlled by one man. Historian Pauline Maier argued that Adams, far from being a radical mob leader, took a moderate position based on the English revolutionary tradition that imposed strict constraints on resistance to authority. That belief justified force only against threats to the constitutional rights so grave that the \\"body of the people\\" recognized the danger, and only after all peaceful means of redress had failed. Within that revolutionary tradition, resistance was essentially conservative. In 2004, Ray Raphael's Founding Myths continued Maier's line by deconstructing several of the \\"Sam\\" Adams myths that are still repeated in many textbooks and popular histories. Samuel Adams's name has been appropriated by commercial and non-profit ventures since his death. The Boston Beer Company created Samuel Adams Boston Lager in 1985, drawing upon the tradition that Adams had been a brewer; it became a popular award-winning brand. Adams's name is also used by a pair of non-profit organizations, the Sam Adams Alliance and the Sam Adams Foundation. These groups take their names from Adams in homage to his ability to organize citizens at the local level to achieve a national goal.

Its first offering, its online backup service later branded \\"SpiderOak ONE\\", launched in December 2007. SpiderOak is accessible through an app for Windows, Mac and Linux computer platforms, and Android, N900 Maemo and iOS mobile platforms. According to SpiderOak, the software uses encrypted cloud storage and client- side encryption key creation, so SpiderOak employees cannot access users' information. SpiderOak differentiates itself from its competition by this kind of encryption, in provision for syncing files and folders across multiple devices, and in automatic de-duplication of data. Some components of SpiderOak are open-source; in 2009, the company announced its intent for the SpiderOak One client's code to be fully open-source in the future. , the SpiderOak One client's source code is only available open-source for mobile platforms, with no current plans to make the desktop client's code open-source. SpiderOak's password manager Encryptr is open-source; the source code for its group messaging application Semaphor is published to allow auditing.  History  SpiderOak was founded in 2007 by Ethan Oberman and Alan Fairless as an encrypted private backup program. In 2013, SpiderOak began developing the Crypton framework, \\"a JavaScript framework for building applications where the server doesn't know the contents it's storing on behalf of users.\\" Crypton is an open-source project allowing developers to easily add encryption security to mobile applications. By mid-2014, according to Oberman, SpiderOak had near 1 million users. As of 2014, SpiderOak was headquartered in Chicago and employed 42 staff, headed by CEO Alan Fairless. Around the same time, the company had offices in Chicago and Kansas City, and was hiring remote employees inside and outside of the US. In 2015, SpiderOak raised $3.5 million in Series A funding, bringing its total funding to around $9 million. In February 2017, SpiderOak discontinued using the phrase \\"zero knowledge\\" to describe their service following public criticism that the phrase conflicted with the mechanism behind cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs. SpiderOak adopted the phrase \\"no knowledge\\" for their marketing. In November 2017, founder Alan Fairless was replaced as CEO by Christopher Skinner, who announced that the company would be expanding into enterprise software, partially funded by a $2 million Series B round. On August 1, 2018, the warrant canary on SpiderOak's website briefly vanished, followed by some system downtime. It was then replaced by a transparency report. Five days later, the canary was re-signed using GPG encryption. By August 9, Spideroak had also updated their transparency report, making a statement concerning the canary. It is impossible to tell if the change was internally driven or canary was tripped and the company has been compelled by court order to hide the fact.

This colourless liquid is one of several binary phosphorus hydrides. It is the impurity that typically causes samples of phosphine to ignite in air. An older name is diphosphine. Properties, preparation, reactions Diphosphane adopts the gauche conformation (like hydrazine, less symmetrical than shown in the image) with a P‚àíP distance of 2.219 angstroms. It is nonbasic, unstable at room temperature, and spontaneously flammable in air. It is only poorly soluble in water but dissolves in organic solvents. Its 1H NMR spectrum consists of 32 lines resulting from an A2XX'A'2 splitting system. Diphosphane is produced by the hydrolysis of calcium monophosphide, which can be described as the Ca2+ derivative of .

He is the composer of the 1971-1984 PBS identity music. Biography Levi received a B.A. in music at Oberlin College and later received his M.M. and D.M.A at Juilliard while studying with composition teachers Hall Overton and Vincent Persichetti. He has taught at the Aaron Copland School of Music, Rutgers University, Manhattan School of Music, New York University, Lehman College, and Baruch College, and has been the composer in residence at Wolf Trap Farm Park, Portland State University, and the White Plains High School. Levi has won numerous awards and grants including a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Grand Prize for Opera from the National Music Theater Network, Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the American Composers Alliance Recording Award, and grants from the American Music Center and Meet the Composer. He lived for a year in Munich on a DAAD Grant and has had residencies at several artist colonies. Levi‚Äôs commissions include the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, New York Choral Society, New Amsterdam singers, New York Chamber Symphony, Chamber Music Northwest, Robert DeCormier Singers, and the Music Today Series. Performers of his music include conductors Pierre Boulez, Jes√∫s L√≥pez-Cobos, Robert De Cormier, Clara Longstreth, Gustav Meier, and Gerard Schwarz; pianist Justin Kolb; and singers Margaret Ahrens, David Bender, Adam Klein, Antonia Lavanne, Douglas Perry, Neva Pilgrim, Lucy Shelton, Sheila Schonbrun, and James Archie Worley, as well as Cantors Richard Botton and Mark Lipson. Publishers include Becatone Music, Lawson-Gould Music Publishers, Margun Music, Merion Music, Mobart Music Publications, and New Jewish Music Press. Recordings can be heard on Albany Records (Acts of Love; Bye, Bye Toots), Centaur Records (Mark Twain Suite), and CRI (Five Progressions for Three Instruments). Musical style Levi composes in a wide variety of styles and genres, never pigeonholing himself as a composer of a specific type of music. His vocal and choral works are notable for their clear projection of content and meaning of the text without compromising the quality of the music. In addition to his many works written for professional performers, Levi has composed a group of pieces that were commissioned as presents for major birthdays of amateur musicians, including cellist James Wolfensohn. Levi writes, ‚ÄúThe most important thing I learned from Hall Overton was to write with a comedian's sense of timing, even in non-comedic works.‚Äù His pieces feature a combination of lyricism and drama, often with an underlying or overt sense of humor. His most significant works, both for chorus, orchestra, and soloists, include the comedic Mark Twain Suite as well as his Passover Oratorio, Dayenu, which commemorates the Exodus from Egypt and an escape from a concentration camp during the Holocaust. The New Music Connoisseur has written, ‚ÄúMr. Levi has a natural flair for theatrical choral music‚Äù. Like many composers, Mr. Levi has written memorial works, but also has composed a piece celebrating birth, In the Womb, for chorus with electronic accompaniment. Levi has been an influential composition teacher to many composers including Alex Weiser and Murray Hidary. Levi is also a pianist and conductor. He has accompanied many songs by 20th-century composers and conducted his own works as well as musicals, operettas, and the works of Murray Hidary. Levi and his wife, Cathy Waldman, have performed as the Four- Hand Band.

According to a rubric of the chansonnier in which the cycle is preserved, Bernart was a mayestre de Bezers (master of B√©ziers). The sirventes cycle was prompted by the Aragonese Crusade and the French invasion of Spain. Bernart's speaks first and his pro-French stance marks him off as one of the school of Gallicised troubadours then active at B√©ziers and including Joan Esteve and Raimon Gaucelm.He begins Nostre reys, qu'es d'onor ses par, \\"Our king, who is of honour without peer\\". The reference to Philip III of France as \\"our king\\" indicates Bernart's allegiance immediately. Bernart's sirventes prompted a response from Peter III of Aragon, the king defending from France's invasion, and who in turn was answered by a few coblas from Peire Salvatge. Peter's vassal Roger Bernard III of Foix, a longtime enemy of the French crown, wrote a response to Salvatge, and an anonymous contributor finished the cycle. Besides his contribution to the cycle of 1285, Bernart has left three works of poetry: two cansos and another sirventes. The canso Be volria de la mellor was a religious song dedicated to the Virgin Mary and modelled on the metre and rhyme scheme of the love song Ben volria ser d'amor by Rigaut de Berbezilh. His other canso deals with courtly love. The sirventes En Guillems Fabres, sap fargar was dedicated to his friend and fellow troubadour Guillem Fabre. NotesSources *Riquer, Mart√≠n de.

Performance is an important factor in design and selection of breathing regulators for any application, but particularly for underwater diving, as the range of ambient operating pressures and temperatures, and variety of breathing gases is broader in this application. A diving regulator is a device that reduces the high pressure in a diving cylinder or surface supply hose to the same pressure as the diver's surroundings. It is desirable that breathing from a regulator requires low effort even when supplying large amounts of breathing gas as this is commonly the limiting factor for underwater exertion, and can be critical during diving emergencies. It is also preferable that the gas is delivered smoothly without any sudden changes in resistance while inhaling or exhaling, and that the regulator does not lock up and either fail to supply gas or free- flow. Although these factors may be judged subjectively, it is convenient to have standards by which the many different types and manufactures of regulators may be objectively compared. Various breathing machines have been developed and used for assessment of breathing apparatus performance. Ansti Test Systems developed a turnkey system that measures the inhalation and exhalation effort in using a regulator, and produces graphs indicating the work of breathing at the set depth pressure and respiratory minute volume for the gas mixture used. Publishing results of the performance of regulators in the ANSTI test machine has resulted in performance improvements. Applications Breathing performance of the regulator is relevant in all circumstances where a demand regulator is used to provide breathing gas. In some of these applications, a very basic regulator will perform adequately. In other applications, the performance of the regulator may limit the performance of the user. A high-performance regulator for a given combination of gas mixture and ambient pressure will provide a low work of breathing at high RMV. Another aspect of breathing performance is demand regulator performance in cold water, where a high flow rate may cause chilling sufficient to lock up the mechanism with ice, which usually causes a severe free-flow with consequent loss of breathing gas, which can only be stopped by shutting off the cylinder valve. *Scuba diving ‚Äì All breathing gas is carried in high- pressure cylinders by the diver **Recreational scuba diving ‚Äì Air and nitrox at ambient pressures up to about 30 msw **Technical diving ‚Äì Ambient pressures may significantly exceed 30 msw ***Mixed gas ‚Äì Breathing gases containing helium to limit narcosis and work of breathing ***Decompression gas ‚Äì Breathing gases with high oxygen partial pressures, generally not very high ambient pressure *Surface-supplied diving ‚Äì Breathing gas supplied from the surface at a wide range of depths **Open circuit ‚Äì Gas is released into the environment and lost on exhalation **Breathing gas reclaim systems ‚Äì Helium based breathing gas is returned to the surface for recycling via an exhaust regulator to save expensive gas *Built-in breathing systems in hyperbaric environments ‚Äì High oxygen content gas is vented to the exterior via an exhaust regulator to avoid high fire risk. High performance not generally needed, as the user is normally resting. *Oxygen administration for first aid in diving accidents ‚Äì High oxygen fraction at surface pressure, fairly low flow rate, but user may be injured and have difficulty breathing. *Breathing apparatus for work in unbreathable atmospheres ‚Äì Usually at ambient pressures close to normal atmospheric pressure, breathing air. Work rate can be high but should not be extreme. Positive pressure breathing may be used in toxic atmospheres to reduce risk of contamination due to leaks. **Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) for rescue and firefighting ‚Äì Users may have to work hard in difficult conditions, but pressure range is generally close to normal atmospheric pressure. Work rate may be extreme in emergencies. Positive pressure masks may be used, which will offset the pressure graph, but not necessarily increase the net work of breathing. *Emergency breathing gas supply in submarines (BIBS) ‚Äì Survival conditions, at unpredictable pressures. *Oxygen supply for unpressurized aircraft ‚Äì Low ambient pressure due to high altitude. Air supply enriched by additional oxygen. Flow rate not expected to be very high Relevance A healthy person at rest at surface atmospheric pressure expends only a small amount of available effort on breathing. This can change considerably as the density of breathing gas increases at higher ambient pressure. When the energy expended to remove carbon dioxide produces more carbon dioxide than it removes the person will suffer from hypercapnia in a positive feedback cycle ending in unconsciousness and eventually death. Work of breathing is affected by breathing rate, breathing pattern, gas density, physiological factors, and the fluid dynamic details of the breathing apparatus, the namely frictional resistance to flow, and pressure differences required to open valves and hold them open to flow. Breathing gas density can be reduced by using helium as the basic component, with sufficient oxygen added to suit the circumstances and retain a partial pressure sufficient to sustain consciousness but not so much as to cause oxygen toxicity problems. Frictional resistance to flow is influenced by the shape and size of the gas passages, and the pressure, density, viscosity, and velocity of the gas. Valve cracking pressure is a factor of design and settings of the valve mechanisms. The breathing performance of regulators assumes gas density is specified and measures the resistance to flow during the full breathing cycle with a given volumetric flow rate as a pressure drop between the mouthpiece and the exterior environment. Measurement=Work of breathing= Work of breathing (WOB) is the energy expended to inhale and exhale a breathing gas. It is usually expressed as work per unit volume, for example, joules/litre, or as a work rate (power), such as joules/min or equivalent units, as it is not particularly useful without a reference to volume or time. It can be calculated in terms of the pulmonary pressure multiplied by the change in pulmonary volume, or in terms of the oxygen consumption attributable to breathing. The total work of breathing when using a breathing apparatus is the sum of the physiological work of breathing and the mechanical work of breathing of the apparatus. In a normal resting state the physiological work of breathing constitutes about 5% of the total body oxygen consumption. It can increase considerably due to illness or constraints on gas flow imposed by breathing apparatus, ambient pressure, or breathing gas composition. =Cold water function testing= U.S. Navy Experimental Diving Unit's unmanned cold water test procedures (1994) have been used as an unofficial standard for cold water testing by various military users and major equipment manufacturers. European CE open circuit standard EN 250 of 1993 set a higher level for open circuit scuba testing for breathing performance, cold water testing, proof, pressure, mechanical, storage temperatures, and CO2 wash out tests. The standard also set requirements for failure modes and effects analysis, and other issues relating to manufacturing, quality assurance and documentation. This standard drew attention to issues with a lot of existing equipment, and led to major improvements in open circuit regulator performance. Early testing done by the US Navy was the origin of underwater breathing apparatus simulation testing in the late 1970s. The breathing simulator systems built by Stephen Reimers were bought by the Ministry of Defence in the UK and by some private equipment manufactures like Kirby Morgan Diving Systems, and helped develop European standards in the early 1990s, but the introduction of a complete breathing simulator system by ANSTI Test Systems Ltd in the UK made possible the accurate breathing simulator testing that is the current practice. The computerized ANSTI breathing simulator systems made faster, easier and more accurate testing possible, and are designed for testing in all realistic water temperatures. The system includes precise humidity and exhalation temperature control as well as environmental water temperature control from , facilities for breath by breath CO2 analysis and closed circuit rebreather set point control and scrubber endurance testing. Neither the EN250 standard nor the US Navy unmanned test procedures use any kind of real world human diving scenario as the basis for testing, including cold water testing. The US Navy procedure has been to test regulators primarily at a depth of 190 fsw (58 msw) in water at a very high breathing rate of 62.5 lpm for a minimum of 30 minutes, with inlet pressure to the first stage of , which results in an average second stage inlet temperature of around , compared to an average of if would be used. The US Navy cold water test criteria and the EU EN250 test criteria are based on whether the regulator meets minimum breathing performance requirements and whether or not a free flow starts. Very few regulators can pass this test because all regulators will form ice in the second stage under the extreme test conditions, though this may not cause the regulator to free flow or go outside the performance criteria. The cold water testing specified in EN250:2000 has scuba regulators tested in water or colder. Regulators are tested in both facing forward and facing down positions. The test starts at (50 msw) 165 fsw and the regulator is breathed at 62.5 lpm for five minutes. To pass, the regulator must remain within the work of breathing limits and must not free flow. The formation of ice is not considered as long as the ice does not degrade the breathing performance beyond minimum performance requirements, and it does not free-flow. The CE test uses an air supply starting at the highest pressure the regulator is rated for and is breathed for five minutes at 62.5 lpm using an exhalation temperature of 28 ¬±2¬∞C (82.4 ¬±3.6¬∞F) and an exhalation relative humidity of no less than 90%. =ANSTI machine= The ANSTI Breathing Simulator is rated to a maximum working pressure of 100 msw. It uses a piston mechanism to provide an accurate and repeatable volume displacement with a sine wave drive mechanism. It has adjustable tidal volume and breathing rate settings which can provide ventilation rates from 10 to 180 litres per minute. EU Standards In the European Union the standard EN250:2000 Respiratory equipment. Open-circuit self-contained compressed air diving apparatus. Requirements, testing, marking defines minimum performance standards for \\"Open-circuit self-contained compressed air diving apparatus\\", and BS 8547:2016 defines requirements for demand regulators to be used at depths exceeding 50 m. EN 13949: 2003 ‚Äì Respiratory Equipment ‚Äì Open Circuit Self-Contained Diving Apparatus for use with Compressed Nitrox and Oxygen ‚Äì Requirements, Testing, Marking defines requirements for regulators to be used with raised levels of oxygen. The standard contains limits on inhalation and exhalation pressures and overall work of breathing. It specifies the following, under test conditions of a breathing rate of per minute and an ambient pressure of : *Work of breathing: <3.0 joules per litre *Peak respiratory pressure: ¬±25 mbar (¬±2.5 kPa) (inhalation or exhalation) *Inhalation work of breathing: <0.3 joule per litre *Pressure spikes with no measurable positive work of breathing: <10 mbar (1 kPa) *Pressure spikes with measurable positive work of breathing: <5 mbar (0.5 kPa) Although a regulator meeting the above limits will supply sufficient air where the first stage feeds a single second stage, it is not necessarily capable of supplying sufficient air in all circumstances when a single first stage feeds two second stages simultaneously. =Related standards= In Europe, EN 250: 2014 ‚Äì Respiratory Equipment ‚Äì Open Circuit Self - Contained Compressed Air Diving Apparatus ‚Äì Requirements, Testing and Marking defines the minimum requirements for breathing performance of regulators, and BS 8547:2016 defines requirements for demand regulators to be used at depths exceeding 50 m.

Biography His early studies were probably with James Hopwood and Lecouturier; but his chief master was Leon Cogniet, with whom he began engraving in 1850. In this year, he entered the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. At first he had to engrave fashion-plates to make money enough to live, but his application to his art brought him the Prix de Rome for engraving, in 1856. At his first public showing in 1860, his prints were called laboured, soft, and flaccid, more like Drypoint etchings than burin work, and he was advised to adhere to the established rules of his art. Gaillard had already chosen a new method, and his work was a shock, because not done according to the formulae of that day. He was such an innovator that in 1863 he was among the \\"Salon des Refus√©s\\", but in their exhibition his portrait of Bellini was hailed by Philippe Burty as the work of a master, \\"who engraved with religious care and showed a high classical talent\\". Gaillard's new manner was to engrave with soft, delicate lines, drawn closely together but not crossing, and to render every fold, wrinkle, or mark on the skin with care. Henceforth Gaillard was represented by engravings and paintings at every Salon. He was best known for his L'Homme √† l'Oeillet, completed in eight days, which brought him only $100. He was the teacher of Fran√ßois-Eug√®ne Burney His portraits of Pius IX and Leo XIII raised \\"the insubordinate scholar\\" to the rank of the reportedly the most celebrated engraver of his day. Another plate is the St. Sebastian, and there is a portrait of Prosper Gu√©ranger. \\"My aim\\", he said, \\"is not to charm, but to be true; my art is to say all.\\" Gaillard was decorated in 1876, became officer of the L√©gion d'honneur in 1886, and President of the Soci√©t√© des Graveurs au Burin in 1886. Just before his death the government ordered him to engrave Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper and Mona Lisa.

It was built between 1969 and 1973, their firsts apartments were given that same year, although the official inauguration of the complex was August 25, 1975. It has a communal hall, a library, a shopping mall and a school. On the Parque Posadas environs there are many residences and old houses, a highschool, and several commerces, like bakeries, restaurants, ice cream shops and a big supermarket. The complex is formed by 10 blocks of buildings, each one of which are formed, as well, by 6 or 7 towers of 13, 14 or 15 floors, depending on the inclination of its internal streets. More than 7000 people live in the 2051 apartments of 1, 2, 3 or 4 rooms of each one of the 61 towers that occupy the Park, who has an 11 hectares (3.4 km¬≤) area. 80% of the people are owners, and the dilatoriness in the common expenses is below of the 20%. The Parque Posadas' Library has more than 35,000 volumes, which turns it in the most important private library of the country.  Government  The Parque Posadas has a Government's Central Assembly, constituted by one representative of each tower, plus the president, the vice-president and the secretary. Each tower has, as well, an independent government, constituted by three members. The administrator of each tower is the Assembly's delegate, who delegates, as well, to an accountant to take care of the general administration.  History  The original idea of building a habitational complex in this area of the department arose from the elaboration of a program destined to give houses to 400 greater adults, with all kind of services, like doctors, cinema, gymnasium, libraries, places of relaxation and shopping. However, by 1969, when the National Plan of House was approved, it was no longer possible to use that enormous estate of 11 hectares to lodge so few people, reason why it began the idea of using that estate as an ideal place for the house construction, due to its centric location, the existence of many services in the area, etc. This way a pilot plan that preview the construction of 2051 apartments with a capacity of 10,000 people was designed. The Parque Posadas was devised and constructed considering several elements, specially the preoccupation to preserve an excellent illumination and to border the land with the objective to generate a microclimate that protected the most aged trees.

Royal York Road, historically known as Church Street or New Church Street, is a north- south arterial road in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is a concession road, 5 concessions (10 km) west of Yonge Street, and runs through many residential neighbourhoods, most notably Mimico and the Kingsway. It is classified as a \\"minor arterial\\" road by the city of Toronto.Royal York Road and Glenroy Avenue ‚Äì Traffic Control Signals The road begins in the south near the shoreline of Lake Ontario, just south of Lake Shore Blvd. It then travels through the neighbourhoods of Mimico, the Queensway, Sunnylea, the Kingsway, and Humber Valley Village. It also serves as the boundary for two neighbourhoods north of Eglinton Avenue; Richview, and Humber Heights. The road crosses three creeks; Mimico Creek, and two tributaries of the Humber River; Humber Creek, and Silver Creek. Royal York Road officially ends at Dixon Road, but its alignment continues further north as St. Phillips Road, which ends at Weston Road. Weston Road continues north on the same concession as Royal York, eventually into Vaughan. History Royal York Road started out as a local street in Mimico called Church Street when the village was settled in the late 19th century. During this time, it was a dirt road north of there. This changed in the 1920s when The Kingsway was developed, and in the 1930s with the development of Humber Valley Village. At this point, the paved section extended up to Eglinton Avenue. The entire road would finally be paved by the 1950s when the remaining areas were developed. Royal York Road has recently undergone several reconstruction projects.Royal York Road Reconstruction The 1.25 metre wide bike lanes that were approved and painted during this process on the stretch between Mimico Creek and Usher Avenue have been criticized for being too narrow, and a violation of Transportation Association of Canada standards (which the city of Toronto follows), for not conforming to the 1.5 metre minimum.BikeToronto - Cyclists abandoned on Royal York Road by Works CommitteeBikeToronto - Council approves compromised bike lane for Royal York Road Public transit The Toronto Transit Commission provides bus services along Royal York Road. Royal York subway station on the Bloor-Danforth line is the major transit terminal that these services feed into. North of Bloor, the main route is 73 Royal York, which also goes along Albion Road in the Rexdale area, and south of Bloor, the primary route is 76 Royal York South, which mainly carries commuters from Mimico. There are two additional routes that serve parts of Royal York because they use it to feed into the subway. These routes are; 48 Rathburn (which uses Royal York from Bloor to Anglesey), and 15 Evans (Bloor to Evans).

Benefits of the site included low shipping and trawling intensities; lack of any dredging, dumping, oil/gas, or MoD practice areas, and of cables or pipelines; as well as low visual impact from the coast, and outside any nature conservation areas. The seabed at the wind farm and offshore cable route consisted of mainly gravely sand, overlying chalk. The electrical power export cable was to be connected to a switching station near Muckleburgh Collection, via landfall near Weybourne Hope. Two routes were considered for the export cable, one avoiding the sandbank at Sheringham shoal. The connection to the National Grid was planned to be made at an electrical substation near Salle, Norfolk via a 132kV underground cable. Planning consent for the wind farm was given on 8 August 2008. In 2009 Statkraft acquired 50% of the shareholding in Scira becoming joint (50:50) owners of the development. In 2014 the Green Investment Bank took a ¬£240 million 20% stake in the wind farm. The lease on the sea bed given by the Crown Estate has a duration of 50 years, and the (initial) wind farm has an estimated lifespan of 20 years. The 2004 Energy Act requires the developer to decommission the wind farm once out of use - the decommissioning plan submitted by the developer included: removal of wind turbines, cutting of foundations at seabed level or lower, whilst interarray cables would be left on the sea bed. =Construction = In April 2008 Nexans was awarded a ‚Ç¨24m contract for the supply and construction of the 145kV export cables, and was awarded a ‚Ç¨12m ($15.8m) contract in April 2009 to supply 81 km of 36kV inter- array cables. Areva obtained a ‚Ç¨50 million contract to supply offshore and onshore substations in late 2008, design and project management of the offshore substations was sub-contracted to Wood Group. Design work on the turbine and substation foundations was contracted to Ramboll. The two foundations for the substations and foundations for 88 turbines were supplied by MT H√∏jgaard. Manufacture of the turbine monopiles and transition pieces was subcontracted to Sif Group and Smulders. The substation superstructure and foundations were subcontracted to Heerema (topside), Bladt Industries (transition pieces) and Sif Group and Smulders (piles). In 2009 Siemens obtained a ‚Ç¨450 million contract to supply 88 wind turbines to the wind farm. Onshore work began in 2009, and construction of the offshore part began March 2010. Turbine foundations installation began in June 2010; MT H√∏jgaard installed the substation piles and 17 of the turbine foundations, using the vessel Svanen, halting installation due to a previously scheduled contract for the installation vessel. The foundations installed by MT H√∏jgaard used a special method: the support of the foundation on the delivery barge had its motion steadied by a 135t sliding support with hydraulic motors compensating for wave oscillations. Delays of several months of the arrival of foundation transport vessels, coupled with wave conditions limiting the operational window of use of the transport vessels, meant that the vessel Svanen was not able to install all the foundations. The delay had an estimated additional cost of 600 million NOK. Export cable installation began late 2010, under contract to Visser & Smith Marine Contracting. Work was carried out by the ships Atlantic Guardian (route clearance), Team Oman (laying), and VOS Sympathy (trenching). The offshore substations were installed in May 2011 by Heerema. The remaining pile foundations, and the transition pieces and offshore substation topsides where installed by Seaway Heavy Lifting between May and August 2011 using the newly built Oleg Strashnov. A previous contract with Master Marine for the substation installation was cancelled and transferred to Seaway due to the delays. Foundation and transition piece installation was complete by August 2011. Inter-array cables were laid by Team Oman, and installed under the sea bed by water jetting by Toisa Warrior. Installation was complete by March 2012. The turbine installation was contracted to Gulf Marine Services in December 2010, the initial contract with Master Marine was terminated by mutual agreement after the foundation installation delays. Turbine installation was carried out by the jackup vessels Sea Jackand GMS Endeavour, with SEA JACK replaced by Sea Jack Leviathan in late 2011. The first turbine was installed on 3 July 2011, and began generating in August 2011; installation was complete by July 2012. Operations bases As part of the development, the harbour and channel at Wells Harbour was dredged to allow wind-farm maintenance vessels to be based there. A pontoon jetty was also built; the work was completed early 2010. An onshore operations base was constructed at Egmere, 3 miles south of Wells-next-the-Sea, with building work taking place in 2012. =Operation= The wind farm was operational by late 2011. An official opening took place on September 27, 2012 attended by Norway's Crown Prince Haakon and UK Secretary of State Ed Davey. The cost of development has been estimated at 10billion Norwegian krona ($1.8 billion). Wells Harbour is used as the operational base for the wind farm. In June 2013 a consortium, \\"Blue Transmission\\" (Macquarie Capital Group, Barclays Infrastructure Funds) acquired the electrical transmission assets of the wind farm for ¬£193 million. In August 2013 Statkraft took over operations and maintenance of the wind farm from Scira. Statoil took over operation from Statkraft, beginning in 2017, while also increasing its share in the proposed Dogger Bank Wind Farm. By September 2013 the wind farm had generated 1.2TWh in its first year of operation.

From Angelo Mariani and Joseph Uzanne (1894). Figures contemporaines tir√©es de l‚ÄôAlbum Mariani, Volume I. Paris:Ernest Flammarion. Eug√®ne Bouchut (; 18 May 1818 ‚Äì 26 November 1891) was a French physician born in Paris. He made significant contributions in several medical fields, including pediatrics, laryngology, neurology and ophthalmology. Career Bouchut obtained his doctorate in medicine in Paris in 1843. Soon afterwards, he became Chef de clinique at the H√¥tel-Dieu de Paris. In 1852 he became a member of the medical staff at the H√¥pital Bon Secours, and later at the H√¥pital Sainte-Eugenie and the H√¥pital Necker-Enfants Malades. He taught at the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes and H√¥pital Sainte-Eugenie, and in 1857 and 1859 substituted for Andr√© Dum√©ril (1774‚Äì1860) at the Facult√© de M√©decine. Notable achievements In 1858, Bouchut developed a new technique for non-surgical orotracheal intubation to bypass obstruction of the larynx resulting from a diphtheria- related pseudomembrane. His method involved introducing a small straight metal tube into the larynx, securing it by means of a silk thread and leaving it there for a few days until the pseudomembrane and airway obstruction had resolved sufficiently. Bouchut presented this experimental technique along with the results he had achieved in the first seven cases at the Acad√©mie des Sciences conference on 18 September 1858. The members of the Academy initially rejected Bouchut's ideas, largely as a result of highly critical and negative remarks made by the influential Armand Trousseau. Undaunted, Bouchut later introduced a set of tubes (Bouchut's tubes) for intubation of the trachea, as an alternative to tracheotomy in cases of diphtheria. Bouchut was also among the first practitioners of \\"cerebroscopy\\" (now referred to as ophthalmoscopy), a technique used for examining the interior of the eye for diagnosis of brain disorders such as meningitis.On the use of the ophthalmoscope in diseases of the nervous system by Thomas Clifford AllbuttviaLibri on \\"Du diagnostic des maladies du syst√®me nerveux par l'ophthalmoscopie\\". Publications Bouchut published a number of works on pediatrics, and was the author of an important book on acute and chronic neurasthenia titled De l'√âtat nerveux aigu et chronique, ou nervosisme. He also published Trait√© des signes de la mort et des moyens de pr√©venir les enterrements pr√©matur√©s, a treatise concerning the prevention of premature burials, which won an award from the Acad√©mie des sciences in 1846.Stethoscopes Death, the Last Taboo See also History of tracheal intubation ReferencesExternal links * Tracheotomy versus Intubation Category:19th-century French physicians Category:French pediatricians Category:1818 births Category:1891 deaths Category:People from Paris ","title":"Eug√®ne Bouchut"},{"id":"15125546","title":"Apogee Stadium"},{"id":"15125567","text":"Alo! is a daily tabloid newspaper published in Belgrade, Serbia.

The film is a portrayal of one of the \\"Four Beauties\\" of ancient China, in this case the titular Diaochan, from the late Eastern Han Dynasty era. Like Diaochan, the film is also known by the literal translation of her name, the Sable Cicada. The film, a lavish historical costume drama, represented something of a revival of Chinese filmmaking in Shanghai following the occupation of the city by Japanese forces. Under the aegis of the Xinhua Film Company, Diao Chan's success allowed for significant output of wartime films from Chinese studios during the \\"Solitary Island\\" period of the late 1930s and early 1940s. Cast * Gu Lanjun as Diaochan * Jin Shan as L√º Bu * Gu Eryi as Dong Zhuo * Wei Heling as Wang Yun * Tang Jie as Li Jue Production history Production of Diao Chan, a historical epic based on the life of one of the legendary Four Beauties of China, began in January 1937 under director Bu Wancang for the Xinhua Film Company.Fu, p. 6 Originally the film was to be part of an ambitious plan to release a film based on each beauty: Diao Chan, Xi Shi, Wang Zhaojun, and Yang Guifei, though only Diao Chan was ever made. With 90% of shooting complete, however, the production was shut down with the outbreak of the Second Sino- Japanese War. As a result of Japanese bombing of Shanghai, nearly all the film sets were destroyed, and most of the cast fled to the country's interior. With the reopening of the Xinhua Film Company in late 1937, the company found itself in the center of Shanghai's \\"Solitary Island.\\" The company's head, Zhang Shankun announced that despite the fact the film was incomplete (and Shanghai's film infrastructure in shambles), the release of Diao Chan would relaunch Shanghai's \\"Hollywood of the East.\\" Zhang therefore moved production to Hong Kong, renting the Nanyue Studio in Hong Kong) a far more expensive undertaking than filming in Shanghai), and flying most of the cast to Hong Kong from the interior, not to mention transporting equipment from Shanghai.Fu, pp. 6-7 Using the Hong Kong studio (and Hong Kong extras), the production was completed in April 1938.Fu, p. 7 Reception Zhang invested heavily in the film's publicity in both Shanghai and Hong Kong, declaring the film as China's first big-budget historical epic. Zhang's gamble in the expensive production and publicity would soon pay off, as Diao Chan became a commercial success in both Shanghai and Hong Kong, and was even screened in Shanghai's Grand Theater, which had heretofore been reserved for first-run American-made features.Fu, pp. 7-8 Zhang then distributed the film to the United States, where it played mainly in the Chinatowns of New York City and San Francisco.Fu, p. 8 More importantly, the film renewed the fortunes of Zhang Shankun's Xinhua Film Company, which was able to sign on important talent in Shanghai.Fu, pp. 8-10 The success of the film also led to the production of one of the most important and most successful films of the Solitary Island period, Bu Wancang's Mulan Joins the Army.

Previously known, in part, as the \\"Glen Rose form\\", this crocodylomorph is notable for its procoelous vertebrae, otherwise found only in derived eusuchian crocodilians (the vertebrae articulate with a cup on the anterior surface and a rounded posterior surface), a thick margin on the maxillae (the main tooth-bearing bones of the upper jaw; thus \\"thick lipped crocodile\\"), and a shield of armor on the neck formed by the fusion of six individual scutes. Description Pachycheilosuchus is based on SMU 75278, a right maxilla, with the remains of at minimum 13 other individuals also known, representing most of the skeleton except hands, feet, and part of the skull. The remains were recovered near the top of the Glen Rose Formation of Erath County in central Texas, in rocks dating from the early Albian faunal stage. The fossils were found in a bonebed in a limestone rock unit, with scattered lenses of mudstone, probably deposited in a shallow, protected, nearshore brackish water setting. The type species is P. trinquei, in honor of Lance Trinque, a field assistant who helped discover and excavate the site where this animal's remains were found. This genus was named and described by Jack Rogers in 2003. It was not a large crocodylomorph; for example, of the collected thigh bones, the longest measured only 91.2 millimeters long (3.59 in). Its body length is estimated as 63.5 centimeters (2.08 ft) to 80 centimeters (2.6 ft), using two methods. Although the remains are small, it appears that at least some of the individuals were mature, with fusion of parts of individual vertebrae. Additionally, a 49 millimeter-long (1.9 in) crocodyloid egg was recovered with the skeletal fossils, and is of reasonable size to have come from an individual with a length of 63.5 centimeters, suggesting that some of the individuals were sexually mature. The maxillae had overhanging lips along their outer margins, and the tooth row was set away from the margin. One maxilla has an oval puncture mark, 5 millimeters by 6.5 millimeters (0.2 by 0.26 in), probably made by a larger predator. The snout was short and flat. The vertebrae were procoelous in the neck, back, and part of the tail, and the procoelous shape was most strongly developed in the neck vertebrae. Procoely is a type of vertebral articulation, based on the shape of the anterior and posterior faces of the vertebral centrum. In procoelous vertebrae, the vertebrae articulate with a concave leading surface and a convex posterior surface. The vertebrae of Pachycheilosuchus had a slight dimple or concavity on the posterior surface as well, making these bones different from the procoelous vertebrae that are a hallmark of derived eusuchian crocodilians. Because of this difference, and because Pachycheilosuchus did not have many of the other features of eusuchians, it probably evolved procoely independently. The ulna, the major bone of the forearm, is strongly curved. Pachycheilosuchus had among its armor a unique shield of bony scutes for its neck, composed of six individual fused scutes. Classification Using a cladistic analysis, Rogers found that Pachycheilosuchus was most likely closest to the Atoposauridae. This clade of small crocodylomorphs is also known from the Early Cretaceous, and includes some members with procoelous vertebrae. The \\"Glen Rose Form\\" Previously, Glen Rose crocodylomorph fossils had been known under the informal designation of the \\"Glen Rose Form\\". Fossils known under this name include a skull at the National Museum of Natural History and two partial skeletons at the Texas Memorial Museum, along with isolated bones. With the description of Pachycheilosuchus, it appears that the \\"Glen Rose Form\\" had been chimeric; the skull and the two skeletons lack the lipped jaw and procoelous vertebrae, and so are not Pachycheilosuchus but an undescribed form, but at least some of the isolated remains are Pachycheilosuchus. Thus, there were at least two crocodylomorphs in the Glen Rose Formation.

The territory corresponded roughly to the region around the city of Treviso, including Belluno, Feltre, and Ceneda and the dioceses of all four cities. It bordered the March of Verona and the Muson. For this reason, the motto Monti Musoni Ponto dominorque Naoni was used for the march as early as 1162. Over time the march of Verona (Verona, Vicenza, and Padua) became merged with that of Treviso and the Trevisan denomination preferred. In the High Middle Ages the region was under the domination of the Guelph Caminesi and the Ghibelline Ezzelini families. In time the march came under the control of the Republic of Venice. Rolandino of Padua wrote a Chronicle of the Trevisan March around 1262, recounting the history of the Ezzelini and their dominance there.

She was commissioned in and served during the Second World War, and was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat in 1944. She had been adopted by the civil community of Northampton in November 1941. Construction and commissioning Laforey was ordered from the yards of Yarrow Shipbuilders, Scotstoun, Glasgow on 31 March 1938 under the 1937 Naval Estimates. She was laid down on 1 March 1939 at the same time as her sister, . She was launched on 15 February 1941 and commissioned on 26 August 1941. She cost ¬£445,684, excluding items such as weapons and communications equipment supplied by the Admiralty. On commissioning she was assigned to the 19th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet as the Flotilla leader. Career=Mediterranean waters= HMS Ark Royal sinking after being torpedoed by . HMS Legion is alongside to take off survivors. Laforey is approaching to aid in providing water and power to the few remaining personnel on board. Laforey was almost immediately reassigned to the Mediterranean, where she joined Force H in escorting a relief convoy to Malta as part of Operation Halberd. Despite heavy air attacks, the convoy reached Malta on 28 September, and Laforey returned to Gibraltar with the ships of Force X. In October she was permanently assigned to Force H, to carry out convoy escort duties, and fleet screening patrols. On 10 November she and the destroyers , , , , and the Dutch were deployed to escort the cruiser , the battleship and the aircraft carriers and during an operation to deliver aircraft to Malta. Ark Royal was torpedoed by the German submarine on 13 November as the task force returned to Gibraltar. Laforey made several unsuccessful anti-submarine attacks against suspected sonar contacts, before standing by the stricken carrier. Later in the day, Laforey ran power cables across to Ark Royal to support damage control measures. These were ultimately unsuccessful and Ark Royal sank the next day, and Laforey returned to Gibraltar. Laforey spent January as part of anti-submarine patrols that had been instigated to intercept U-boats as they passed through the Strait of Gibraltar. On 18 January she and intercepted and attacked with depth charges. February and March were then spent escorting convoys through the Atlantic, and screening aircraft carriers on operations to deliver aircraft to Malta. On 1 April Laforey was detached from Force H and sailed to Freetown to screen fleet units and cover convoys in the Atlantic. She arrived at Cape Town on 18 April with a military convoy, and escorted them on to Durban, arriving there on 22 April. =Operation Ironclad= On 28 April she was deployed to support Operation Ironclad, the planned Invasion of Madagascar. She carried out shore bombardments on 2 May and then, together with the destroyers and Lightning, used buoys to mark the approach channel to the landing areas at Diego Suarez on 4 May. The next day, Laforey and Lightning led landing ships into the harbour, and provided naval gunfire support. On 6 May, Laforey and her sisters Lightning and screened the battleship during a search for Japanese warships that had been reported in the area. On 7 May Laforey covered Anthony as she landed marines and the next day she began a series of anti-submarine patrols that would last until she was detached from the operation on 27 May, when she, Lookout and Lightning sailed for Colombo to join the Eastern Fleet. She spent June with the Eastern Fleet, mostly carrying out exercises and conducting offensive sweeps, before sailing to Mombasa on 23 June. =Return to the Mediterranean= Arriving at Mombasa on 1 July, she was initially deployed in the South Atlantic to hunt commerce raiders and escort convoys. On 19 July she was detached and nominated to rejoin Force H. After sailing around Africa with a number of other capital ships, she arrived at Gibraltar in early August. She sailed on 9 August, escorting the ships comprising Operation Pedestal. On 10 August she and Lookout escorted the aircraft carrier in an attempt to deliver aircraft to Malta, but were detached on 11 August to rescue survivors from the torpedoed aircraft carrier . The two ships and a rescue tug were able to rescue 927 survivors. After transferring survivors to , Laforey continued escorting the convoy. Together with and , she launched an unsuccessful attack on the later that day. The next day, 12 August, the ships of the convoy came under heavy air attack. Laforey managed to escape damage and with a number of other ships, was detached from the convoy when it reached the Sicilian Narrows. They remained in the area until 14 August, when they sailed for Gibraltar, arriving there on 15 August. She deployed the next day to escort Furious and in another delivery of aircraft to Malta. They returned on 18 August and on 21 August Laforey began anti-submarine operations off Gibraltar. On 4 September she and Lookout escorted into Gibraltar. Laforey then sailed for Southampton for a refit, arriving there on 17 September. She spent October and most of November under refit, followed by a period of post-trial workup exercises with her sister Lightning at Scapa Flow. She and Lightning then escorted the troopship out of Liverpool en route to Gibraltar, where they arrived on 20 December. On 21 December Laforey and Lightning carried out rescue operations after the torpedoing of . =Force Q= Laforey and her flotilla were assigned to B√¥ne as part of Force Q at the start of 1943. The ships of the force came under heavy air attack and Laforey had to sink the tanker on 6 January after she had been set on fire during an air raid. Laforey carried out interception patrols and convoy defence throughout February and March. On 28 April she and took part in an action against six E-boats and a submarine. They sank one E-boat by ramming it, and damaged two others. During the action, Laforey sustained damage to her forepeak. In May she was assigned with Force Q to intercept ships attempting to evacuate German troops from Cap Bon after the defeat of the Afrika Korps. On 8 May she and Tartar captured two merchant ships, but on 9 May Laforey came under fire from shore batteries and was hit in the engine room. She sustained damage and several severe injuries to her crew, causing her to head for Malta for repairs. After being repaired, she returned to Force Q. En route, she investigated Plane Island and discovered 23 enemy soldiers, whom she promptly took prisoner. Back with Force Q, on 23 July she sank an enemy supply ship. In June she took part in covering the allied landings at Pantelleria (Operation Corkscrew), during which she bombarded enemy positions, before sailing to Alexandria to escort convoys for the planned invasion of Sicily. After the landings on 9 July she bombarded enemy targets inland. On 15 August she embarked General Alexander, Air Marshall Coningham and Admiral Ramsey and conveyed them to Augusta. She continued to carry out bombardments and anti-submarine patrols throughout July. On 23 July she and engaged in a box search for the Italian submarine Ascianghi after she had torpedoed the cruiser . The Ascianghi fired two torpedoes at the Laforey which both missed and the Laforey and Eclipse carried out five depth charge attacks in response. The Ascianghi was forced to surface where it came under an immediate and heavy fire from the Laforey's guns and was at last sunk. A survivor was picked up who confirmed that the Italian sub had indeed fired four torpedoes at the Newfoundland two hours previously. In August Laforey was nominated to support the invasion of mainland Italy and on 21 August, she and four other destroyers carried out an offensive sweep through the Strait of Messina. She then escorted the convoys and covered the landings. On 9 August she came under fire during a shore bombardment and was hit by five shells. One of the ship's company was killed and another two were injured, while one boiler room was put out of action. She returned to Malta for repairs to the structural damage. She was under repair until mid-October, when she returned to patrolling off the Italian coast. On 1 November she escorted two merchant ships during their passage from Malta to Naples and on 3 November she escorted a military convoy en route to Augusta. On 5 November she came to the assistance of a US merchant ship that had run aground northeast of Augusta, and towed the vessel clear before returning to Malta to refuel. She spent the rest of the month and most of December at Malta, before returning to the Italian coast on 23 December. On 25 December she detected two E-boats on her radar and moved to intercept them, but they escaped contact and fled. Further shore bombardment operations followed. Laforey was deployed on patrol off Corsica on 4 January, before heading into the Bay of Naples.

The species is indigenous to Louisiana, eastern Texas, and Arkansas. Classification Pantherophis slowinskii was long considered an intergrade of the corn snake (Pantherophis guttata) and the Great Plains rat snake (Pantherophis emoryi), but in 2002 it was elevated to species status and named to honor the memory of American herpetologist Joseph Bruno Slowinski. These three sister-species are probably best identified in Arkansas by simply consulting a range map, given that their ranges in the state do not overlap. Description Slowinski's corn snake is medium-sized and colored grayish-brown, with a series of large, alternating, chocolate- brown blotches. These blotches are often bordered in black. It has a spearhead marking on the head. The belly is checkered black and white, giving it an appearance of maize (its close relative, the corn snake, is believed to have gotten its name for this belly pattern). While this species resembles superficially the prairie kingsnake (Lampropeltis calligaster), the spearhead marking present on the head of Slowinski's corn snake is usually sufficient for identification. Its body has a rounded top, steep sides, and a flat belly. The young of this species can be distinguished from those of the western rat snake (Pantherophis obsoletus) by considering the dark bar that runs through each eye. In Slowinski's corn snake, this bar extends through the jawline and onto the neck, whereas in the western rat snake the bar extends only to the jawline where it stops abruptly. Behavior This species, Pantherophis slowinskii, is nocturnal and quite secretive. Like its sister-species, the Great Plains rat snake (Pantherophis emoryi), it is an excellent climber and likely spends a large portion of its time up in trees. These habits together may explain why it is so infrequently encountered by humans. Its nocturnal tendencies may also help it avoid dangers, such as day-foraging hawks. Slowinski's corn snake is likely similar in temperament to its sister-species, the Great Plains rat snake, which is very tame. Slowinski's corn snake relies mainly on camouflage for defense and rarely bites. This species feeds primarily on small mammals and birds. Prey, when caught, is constricted and consumed. Presumably, it follows an activity pattern similar to other rat snakes: hibernate through winter, breed in the spring, and lay eggs in the summer. Distribution and abundance The abundance of the species P. slowinskii is largely unknown. The lack of voucher specimens from Arkansas seems to indicate that it is extremely rare in that state, being known only from isolated localities in the southeastern part. Trauth et al. indicate only a single locality in the state, Drew County. ReferencesBibliography *Behler JL, King FW (1987).

The Singapore Indian Association was established in 1923 with the objective of promoting the social, physical, intellectual, cultural and the general welfare of its members. When it was formed, the association projected itself as a pan-Indian, rather than narrowly ethnic, language, religion, caste or region-based organization. This marked it as significantly different from most other Indian organisations in Singapore. The association led by the Indian mercantile and professional elite, expanding its membership to include the emerging white collar middle classes as well. Initially, the leaders of the association were seized with the political spirit of the time in both India and Singapore. Many were supporters of the Indian independence movement, and many were also concerned about the social welfare and political rights of the wider Indian community in Singapore and British Malaya, which the city-state was then a part of. The Singapore Indian Association was one of a number of such associations located in towns and cities all across Malaya. With the development of the Merdeka or freedom movement in Malayan politics, these associations became nodal points for the activation of Indian political activism. In time, this contributed to the formation of the Malaysian Indian Congress, the main political party in Malaysia representing the Indian community, and a current member of Malaysia‚Äôs ruling Barisan Nasional coalition government. Singapore politics, however, followed a different path. While Singapore‚Äôs ruling People‚Äôs Action Party (PAP) initially sought to merge with Malaya in a political federation, this eventual union proved to be unviable, resulting in the ejection of Singapore from Malaysia in 1965, when the former became and independent republic. However, even prior to this momentous event, Singapore politics had developed along different lines from the rest of Malaysia. With its different racial makeup, the racial politics of Malaysia did not fit in well with Singapore‚Äôs demographic realities. In Singapore, voters, including Indians and other minorities, tended to support non race-based political parties like the PAP. With the eventual separation of Singapore from Malaysia, and the later consolidation of PAP hegemony over Singapore via a quasi-authoritarian government, the Singapore Indian Association quickly lost its political role and became a social, sports and recreation club. While the association was founded in 1923, its clubhouse was only completed in the 1950s. It is located at the historic Balestier Plain in Singapore, which has acquired formal heritage status for its concentration of a cluster of community associations and sports clubs, such as the Indian Association. In keeping with its early political leanings, the foundation stone of the clubhouse was laid by Jawaharlal Nehru on 18 June 1950. Since its beginning, the association has been extremely active in Singapore‚Äôs sports scene. Sports in which the association is active in include cricket, tennis, hockey, football and billiards. Many of its members and sportspeople also went on to represent Singapore in regional and international tournaments. Over time, the association began to decline in terms of its membership, finances and public profile. However, with a fresh influx of leadership in the late 1990s, its fortunes have improved to some extent. The association‚Äôs website reports a membership of about 1,000 members today. Recently, the association has published a book ‚Äì Passage of Indians - to commemorate its history, as well as that of the Indian community in Singapore.

Economist, 00130613, 11/6/1999, Vol. 353, Issue 8144 Meteorological History The origins of the 1977 Andhra Pradesh cyclone can be traced to a weak tropical disturbance which was first noted on satellite imagery on the morning of 14 November while located roughly 520 km (320 mi) southwest of the Nicobar Islands. Traveling due west at 25 km/h (15 mph) along the southern periphery of the mid-tropospheric subtropical ridge, the disturbance steadily organized, with increased banding noted on satellite imagery. This increase in organization prompted the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to report that the disturbance had intensified into a deep depression later that morning, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system at 13:10 UTC that afternoon. At 08:00 UTC on 15 November, the JTWC issued its first advisory on the system as satellite data indicated that the storm had continued to strengthen, with estimated one-minute sustained wind speeds of 75 km/h (45 mph). While the system was initially developing, an upper tropospheric trough had formed over northern and central India and produced a break in the subtropical ridge. As the storm traveled towards this break in the ridge on 15 November, the mid-tropospheric anticyclone over the system weakened, reducing the storm's steering flow and causing the system to slow to a 7 km/h (5 mph) northwestwards movement. In addition, the divergent southwesterly flow produced by the trough resulted in the system beginning a period of rapid intensification. Early on 16 November, the system intensified into a Category 1-equivalent tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale; an eye was observed on satellite imagery later that morning. Satellite image of the cyclone at peak intensity on 18 November For the next two days, the tropical cyclone continued to strengthen while traveling generally towards the north-northwest. During this time period, increased organization, such as tighter banding features and a progressively more distinct eye, were observed on satellite imagery. At 10:30 UTC on 17 November, the ship Jagatswami reported winds of 190 km/h (120 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of off the Indian coast. The next evening, the JTWC estimated that the system had attained its peak intensity as a Category 3-equivalent tropical cyclone, with one-minute sustained winds of 200 km/h (125 mph), while located roughly 140 km (85 mi) off the coast of Andhra Pradesh. Around this time, the IMD estimated that the system had three-minute sustained winds of 250 km/h (155 mph)‚Äîwhich would classify the system as a modern-day super cyclonic storm‚Äîand a minimum barometric pressure of . This barometric pressure made the cyclone the most intense ever recorded in the North Indian Ocean at the time; the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone and the 1999 Odisha cyclone would both subsequently produce lower barometric pressures. As the cyclone approached the Indian coast, it accelerated to 17 km/h (10 mph) while slightly weakening from its peak intensity. The storm made landfall near Chirala, in the Prakasam district of central Andhra Pradesh, around 11:00 UTC on 19 November with one-minute sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph). Moving northwards over flat agricultural lands, the storm weakened, with the JTWC issuing its final warning at 20:00 UTC that evening. The IMD continued tracking the system, reporting that it weakened into an area of low pressure on the evening of 20 November before dissipating over southeastern Madhya Pradesh and Odisha the next evening.  Impact  The worst affected areas were in the Krishna River delta region. The island of Diviseema, which was hit by a six-metre-high () storm surge, experienced a loss of life running into the thousands. Hundreds of bodies were floating in the waters and bodies bloated beyond recognition were consigned to mass pyres. Landslides ripped off the railway lines in the Waltair-Kirandal route. About 100 people who had left their homes to seek shelter in a church in Bapatla town were killed when the building collapsed. Fields of paddy and cash crops were submerged by the tidal waves. Thirteen sailing vessels, including some foreign ones, went missing in the storm. About 100 villages were marooned or washed away by the cyclonic storms and the ensuing floods and a total of 10,841 killed or missing, and 34 lakh rendered homeless. According to the Janata party, at least 50,000 people were believed to have been killed by the storm, substantially higher than reported by the government.  Aftermath  The large loss of life prompted the establishment of early warning meteorological stations on the coast of Andhra Pradesh. Cyclone shelters and other measures for disaster management were also taken. A memorial, at the point of furthest advance of the tidal wave, near the town of Avanigadda, was built in memory of the people who died in the storm. The next cyclone (1990) that also occurred in Andhra Pradesh, showed that there was a large improvement in disaster management, effective warnings ahead of time, and better meteorological equipment which dramatically reduced the death rate (compared to the cyclone in 1977). In the wake of the disaster, officials in India were accused of covering up the scale of damage and loss of life. Members of the Janata party, an opposing political group to the state government in place at the time, claimed that the cover up was to hide criminal negligence which resulted in tens of thousands of fatalities. Following these accusations, five high-ranking government officials resigned from their positions.

To this end, the organization distributes explanatory materials and offers economic aid to pregnant women considering abortion. Efrat's explanatory materials demonstrate the fetus' qualities of life during the different stages of pregnancy, with the goal of showing that the fetus is a human life. Additionally, the organization presents the medical dangers resulting from abortion, stories of women who had an abortion and later regretted it, and stories of women who planned to have an abortion but ultimately did not. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the organization has concentrated on providing financial support to pregnant women who plan on having an abortion due to their economic situation. The organization's approach is illustrated by the following, quoted from Efrat's website: > What is an abortion? Abortion means ending the life of child who is not > sufficiently developed to survive outside its mother‚Äôs womb. Although the > vast majority of abortions are performed on socio-economic grounds, an > abortion does not resolve financial or social difficulties. Very often, the > psychological scars caused by an abortion only serve to complicate existing > problems. Sometimes, it takes women a lifetime to resolve these issues. > Economic and social problems can be worked out. Situations can - and do - > change. But a life can never be restored. The organization's main offices are located in Jerusalem, and is led by Dr. Eli J. Schussheim, and, according to the organization's website, has 2,800 volunteers working on the streets in Israel. According to the publications by the organization, in 2006 it prevented the abortion of about 2,600 unborn children, and, in total, has prevented about 25,000 abortions as of 2007. Efrat officially views abortion among Jews as a demographic threat to the Jewish people. Consequently, Efrat's activity is only carried out in the Jewish sector of Israeli society. Name The name \\"Efrat\\" comes from I Chronicles, in which Efrat is the name of Caleb's wife (according to Jewish tradition, she is none other than Miriam). The Midrash Rabbah writes, \\"Why was she called Efrat? Because Israel was fruitful (\\"paru\\") and multiplied through her.\\" This refers to her actions against Pharaoh's decree of infanticide, by which she saved the lives of many Israelite children.  Criticism  Various bodies, among them Mishpacha Hadasha (\\"New Family\\"), have attacked the organization. The central complaint is that the religious stance of the organization supports the protection of the pregnancy at almost any price and can make both mother and child miserable, such as pregnancies that involve medical danger. A law proposed by Knesset Member Reshef Chayne of Shinui attempted to prevent Efrat from providing information to women considering abortion, on the basis he considered it harassment of the pregnant woman. The law was not passed, and certain legalists attacked it. Another criticism was that the organization would station women outside offices where abortion permits are issued, with the aim of appealing to women visiting the offices. The Israel Religious Action Center appealed against the rules which regulate the pay grade of those who volunteer for National Service by participating in Efrat's activities, claiming \\"infringement of privacy, dignity and freedom of conscience of the women,\\" an appeal which was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Israel. In 2012, Efrat \\"ambassadors\\" were criticized for encouraging a pregnant teen not to have an abortion, because the teen couple later attempted suicide. In response, Efrat claims that a stance opposing abortion is legitimate, and that in many cases, going through with an abortion will later make the woman miserable. Additionally, the organization claims that it does not coerce women to not perform an abortion, and only provides information. It also wants to ensure that women are not forced into abortions out of economic concerns.

(2012). Turbo Linnaeus, 1758. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=151576 on 2012-09-27 Turbo is the type genus of the family. Description The shells of species in this genus are more or less highly conspiral, thick, about 20‚Äì200 mm, first whorls bicarinate, last whorl large often with strong spiral sculpture, knobs or spines, base convex, with or without umbilicus. Species in this genus have a round aperture and a solid, dome-shaped calcareous operculum. This circular operculum commences as a multispiral disc, like that of a Trochus, upon the outer side of which is deposited a thin calcareous layer by a lobe of the foot which projects partly over it. This arrangement produces an operculum which exhibits all the whorls beneath, but which is only feebly, or not obviously spiral above, from the more or less general distribution of the calcareous matter. The radula is broad and generally rather short. The median, lateral and marginal teeth are always present, and the formula is invariably ‚àû.5.1.5.‚àû. The central teeth contain no cusps. The median tooth consists of a narrow oblong quadrate basal plate, frequently with accessory plates of various forms, to the lower end of which is attached the oval body of the tooth,‚Äîa simple plate without cusp, bearing supporting wings at the sides. Frequently the central teeth are asymmetrical in this group. The laterals bear supporting wings at their outer angles, and are various in form, with or without cusps. The inner marginals are very large, with large cusps.G.W. Tryon (1888), Manual of Conchology X; Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia The first Turbo species were found in the Upper Cretaceous, approximately 100 million years ago.

This new Americanized version was designed as a single 13-episode season (the first episode was entitled ‚ÄúThe Mach 5‚Äôs First Trial‚Äù), with the intent of launching a feature film adaptation. Issues with Warner Bros. having the live action rights (which resulted in the 2008 release) forestalled negotiations and investments for the film and the series ended accordingly, though it did provide a massive merchandising reboot for the intellectual property, which found a resurgence thanks to a major toy line.

Fred Wolf of Fred Wolf Films, had also pitched the notion of rebooting the franchise. PANGEA, having worked developmentally with Playmates Toys in association with Fred Wolf Films on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, worked with Speed Racer Enterprises on the series development, including the merchandising, which included a toy line from Ace Novelty Toys, comic books by NOW Comics, and novelties by NJ Croce.

The hills stretch from Opeongo Lake in Algonquin Park in the west, along the Madawaska and Opeongo Rivers, towards the Opeongo Colonization Road, and extending towards the Deacon Escarpment (north of Killaloe, Ontario in Renfrew County), Bonnechere, Ontario, and Dacre in the east. To the east of the Opeongo Hills lie the Madawaska River valley, the Mississippi River Valley, and the Ottawa- Bonnechere Graben along the Ottawa River. The hills continue into Quebec across the Ottawa River as the Laurentian Highlands and the Laurentian Mountains. Its tallest peak is roughly 7 km northeast of Highway 60. At roughly 586 meters, it is the tallest point in Southern Ontario. The community of Foymount (along the former Highway 512, the Opeongo Line) is one of the highest settlements in Southern Ontario. The Opeongo Hills are a continuation of the Laurentian Highlands, which extend into Eastern Ontario, towards Gananoque, and across the Ottawa River Valley into Quebec, and the Laurentian Mountains, which continue parallel to the St. Lawrence River, north of Montreal, Trois-Rivi√®res and Quebec City. The geography in this area of Central Ontario is dotted with rolling hills and forests with streams, lakes, and small waterfalls, typical of a place in the Canadian Shield. The first European explorer to visit the region is Samuel de Champlain, in 1615, while exploring the area with the Huron natives. When settlers first started arriving in the area in the late 1790s and early 19th century, land areas were given to settlers by the Canadian Land and Emigration Company for settlement and farming. The soils of the area were not perfectly suited for farming, but small-scale agriculture was able to be conducted on the land. Today, the Opeongo Hills are crossed by many provincial highways, many of which still follow the original Historic Colonization Roads.

The mountains are located in the Canadian Shield, and are composed primarily of white quartzite. They extend roughly from La Cloche Provincial Park, south of Massey, to Killarney Provincial Park, southwest of Sudbury. The communities of West River, Willisville and Whitefish Falls are located directly within the range; the town of Espanola and the municipality of Killarney are located nearby, however they can be seen (from some vantage points) as far away as Manitoulin Island. Ontario Highway 6 is the principal transportation route through the range. Killarney Provincial Park is located in the range and is very popular among tourists. Another feature includes the \\"Heaven's Gate Trail\\" which traverses the length of the range from Willisville in the east to Massey in the west. Thought to be an old aboriginal trade route, it traverses the plateau of the range with the North Channel of Lake Huron visible to the south. The trail is particularly grueling and is rarely traversed mostly due to its length and remoteness from major cities. Geology With an estimated age of 1.88 billion years, the La Cloche Mountains consist of metamorphosed quartz sandstone, which accumulated and was deposited in the Georgian Bay region of Ontario 2.5 billion years ago. The mountains themselves were formed during the Penokean Orogeny, a mountain- building stage in the Canadian Shield's geological history. During this time, the sandstone that had accumulated was compressed and heated to form the white Quartzite which dominates the landscape today. The hills comprising the La Cloche Mountains are believed to have once been higher than today's Rocky Mountains, and were eroded down to their current altitude of 539 meters at its peak. They remain among the highest altitudes in Ontario. A southern extension of the La Cloche Mountains, the South La Cloche Mountains, extends to the south and juts into Georgian Bay along Badgeley Point, north of Killarney and Secondary Highway 637. History According to legend, the hills were warning bells, or tocsins, used by local First Nations for signaling. These \\"Bell Rocks\\" could be heard for a considerable distance when struck, and accordingly when voyageurs explored the area they named it with the French word for \\"bell\\" ‚Äî La Cloche.

Some researchers have suggested that McCary's actions led to the LDS Church's subsequent policy of not allowing people of black African descent to hold the priesthood or participate in temple ordinances. Background McCary was born as Warner McCary in Natchez, Mississippi, around 1810 or 1811 to an African American slave named Francis, or \\"Franky\\". Her master was a white carpenter from Pennsylvania named James McCary. She also had two older children, Kitty and Robert, who may have been James's biological children. Upon James McCary's death around 1813, his will emancipated Franky and the older children but declared Warner and his future offspring to \\"be held as slaves during all and each of their lives\\" in the service of his mother and siblings. In 1836, Warner escaped Natchez on a riverboat and went to New Orleans, where he worked at Leeds Foundry until 1840, as well as an occasional musician and cigar vendor. Around this time he married a white Mormon woman, Lucy Stanton Bassett, who claimed to be a Native American woman named Laah Ceil. She claimed her mother was Delaware Indian and father was Mohawk. In his youth, McCary had begun using other names, including James Warner, William McCary, and Cary. He eventually adopted over a dozen aliases, many of which were Native American, including William Chubbee, William Chubbee King, Julius McCary, William McChubby, Okah Tubee, James Warner, and War'ne'wis Ke'ho'ke Chubbee. Presenting himself as a Native American, McCary was helped in 1843 by local whites to get a permit as a free person of color in Mississippi. When he left in 1844, he toured various frontier and eastern cities as a musician and lecturer. During this time he briefly joined with Mormonism where he sparked racial controversy. Conversion to Mormonism McCary arrived in Nauvoo, Illinois, in late 1845. He claimed he was a half-African American and half- Native American named Okah Tubbee and the \\"lost\\" son of Choctaw chief Mushulatubbee. McCary was also known as a skilled ventriloquist and musician. In Council Bluffs, Iowa, in February 1846, he was baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by apostle Orson Hyde, and he was probably ordained to the Melchizedek priesthood. Around this time, McCary also married Lucy Stanton, a white daughter of Daniel Stanton, a former high councilor and stake president. In the winter of 1846‚Äì1847, McCary joined the Latter Day Saints in Winter Quarters, Nebraska. Prophet and excommunication While in Winter Quarters, McCary began claiming powers of prophecy and transfiguration‚Äîhe claimed to have the power to appear as various biblical and Book of Mormon figures. In early 1847, McCary was excommunicated from the church for apostasy and expelled from Winter Quarters. Shortly after his expulsion, Hyde preached a sermon against McCary and his claims. McCary settled a short distance away and began attracting some Winter Quarters followers to his own brand of Mormonism. He instituted plural marriage among his followers, and had himself sealed to several white wives in a changed, sealing ceremony that consisted of sex with him and his first wife Lucy. Effect on LDS Church policy McCary's behavior angered many of the Latter Day Saints in Winter Quarters. Researchers have stated that his marriages to his white wives \\"played an important role in pushing the Mormon leadership into an anti-Black position\\" and may have prompted Brigham Young to institute the priesthood and temple ordinance ban on black people. (Online reprint with author updates) A statement from Young to McCary in March 1847 suggested that up until that point, race had nothing to do with priesthood eligibility\\"Its nothing to do with the blood for [from] one blood has God made all flesh, we have to repent [to] regain what we av lost ‚Äî we av one of the best Elders an African in Lowell [referring to Walker Lewis ].\\" and the earliest known statement about blacks being restricted from the priesthood from any Mormon leader was made by apostle Parley P. Pratt a month after McCary was expelled from Winter Quarters. Speaking of McCary, Pratt stated that he \\"was a black man with the blood of Ham in him which linege was cursed as regards the priesthood\\". After Brigham Young instigated the priesthood and temple ban in 1847, the LDS Church generally did not allow men of black African descent to hold the priesthood again until 1978.

Named for the River Thames in England, she was launched in 1938. With the outbreak of the Second World War, she was acquired by the Royal Navy in June 1940. She was based at the strategically vital naval base at Gibraltar, moving the large warships there in and out of the harbour. Her duties also included coming to the assistance of any allied ships, naval or merchant, that might be damaged and require towing to safety. If this was impossible, she would take off survivors. To protect against air attacks she was fitted with a 12-pounder anti-aircraft gun. HMS Ark Royal On 13 November 1941, the aircraft carrier was torpedoed some 30 miles off Gibraltar by the . After damage control efforts seemed to have stabilised the subsequent flooding, the commander of Force H, Sir James Somerville sped into Gibraltar aboard the battleship to organise salvage operations. The Thames and another tug, the St Day were dispatched to the scene. Thames arrived first and was able to attach a tow line to the stricken carrier. She then attempted to tow her to Gibraltar, but her efforts were foiled by the strong current flowing through the Strait of Gibraltar. Despite towing Ark Royal for nine hours at a speed of two knots, she could make little headway. Ark Royal capsized and sank the following day, 14 November, after being overwhelmed by flooding that could not be controlled. The belief that Ark Royal had been under tow for nine hours led the subsequent Board of Inquiry to assume that Ark Royal had sunk closer to Gibraltar than was actually the case. The true site of the sinking was not discovered until Ark Royal‚Äôs wreck was located by a film crew in 2002. Thames continued in service with the Navy until 1944, by which time the allies had largely secured control of the Mediterranean. She then left Navy service.

Many of the stories had originally appeared in the magazines The Graphic Christmas, Astounding Stories, Thrilling Wonder Stories, Wonder Stories, Weird Tales, Blue Book, Planet Stories, The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's Weekly or in the collections The Fourth Book of Jorkens by Lord Dunsany and The Witchfinder by S. Fowler Wright. Aside from a second printing by Pellegrini and Cudahy in 1949, the anthology has never been reprinted in its original form. All subsequent editions were substantially abridged. The only British hardcover, from Grayson & Grayson in 1956, contained only 11 stories. The only American paperback, a 1959 Berkley Books version, included only 10 of the original 20 stories. The first British paperback, from Panther Books in 1963, also included only 10 stories, though the selection was somewhat different.

Smith is currently involved with the bands Polkadot Cadaver, Knives Out!, and solo project El-Creepo!. Background Smith was the lead singer and songwriter for the multi-genre metal band Dog Fashion Disco from 1996 until 2007, and continued in this role when the band reformed in 2011 until the present day. Smith contributed vocal and guitar work to the 2005 album The Exotic Sounds of the Alter Boys by the Ohio-based band The Alter Boys. On February 18, 2007, Smith started a musical project called Polkadot Cadaver, announced shortly after the break-up of Dog Fashion Disco. Another project, Knives Out! was started in 2008, and each band contains Jasan Stepp (of Dog Fashion Disco). Three albums have been released with Polkadot Cadaver and two albums have been released with Knives Out! =Solo career= Smith has also released 3 solo album under the moniker El- Creepo! The first album was released in 2009 and was aptly titled El-Creepo!. The project is stylistically quite different from his work in other bands, favoring acoustic guitars and light harmonies. Smith began writing and recording a new El-Creepo! album with Polkadot Cadaver drummer Scott Radway in March 2012. The second solo album, Aloha was released November 13, 2012. The third and most recent album titled Bellissimo! was released January 1, 2016. =Razor to Wrist Records= In early 2011, Smith and fellow band-mate Jasan Stepp started up the record label Razor to Wrist Records with the intention of releasing their material on their own label, with the main bands being \\"signed\\" initially Dog Fashion Disco, Polkadot Cadaver, Knives Out!, and El- Creepo!. Though Polkadot Cadaver's album Sex Offender was released after the label was founded, the album was still released on Rotten Records (as the first Polkadot Cadaver album was). The first album to be released by the label was Knives Out!'s Black Mass Hysteria on February 14, 2012. In the summer of 2012, the Dog Fashion Disco video DFDVD was re-released on Razor to Wrist, and on November 13, 2012, the second El-Creepo album Aloha was the second album to be released on the label. The third album released on the label was Polkadot Cadaver's third album Last Call in Jonestown, released on May 14, 2013. All future material involving either Smith or Stepp is set to be released on Razor to Wrist. \\"Left in the Lurch\\" is Knives Out!'s second debut album, having been released on August 19, 2016. All of the label's releases up to this point have been available in physical form only through the label's website; digital copies of the material is available on Amazon, iTunes, etc. The label's name is derived from the song \\"Forever and a Day\\" from the Polkadot Cadaver album Sex Offender. Style During the extent of Todd Smith's work as a vocalist, his singing ability has encompassed a range of styles, including a high falsetto, lounge-style singing, guttural growls, and death metal vocals, often incorporating all four into single songs.

The possibility that the prospective voter might change his mind after the poll is very small compared to that of an opinion poll, therefore the margin of error of an entrance poll is expected to be lower than that of an opinion poll. However, the methodology of conducting an entrance poll is closer to that of an exit poll, where actual voters are being queried as opposed to potential voters in an opinion poll. Estimates provided by entrance polls can be obtained more quickly than those of exit polls because the people can be questioned earlier. However, they are also possibly subject to a higher margin of error as early voters are given a higher preference than in exit polls. Furthermore, entrance polls are based upon a future event, meaning there is always the possibility that a voter may change his or her mind between being asked questions for an entrance poll and then actually voting.http://statistics.about.com/od/Applications/a/Entrance-And- Exit-Polls.htm References Category:Elections Category:Types of polling ","title":"Entrance poll"},{"id":"15126616","text":"Fred Wolf Films is an American animation studio founded in the 1960s by Fred Wolf and Jimmy Murakami (the latter of whom worked on the TV special The Snowman).

He is a right- sided defender who has made a number of appearances for Greece's youth teams. More of an endurance player than a virtuoso, he is distinguished by exceptional leg strength. Club career=AEL= He played an important role and became a vital player for AEL during his years with the club, including Larissa's appearances in the UEFA Cup group stages during the 2007‚Äì08 season, attracting interest from Greece's bigger teams. He is the son of Giannis Galitsios, who was also a star player for his hometown team, Larissa, in the 1980s. Scored first league goal on 7 October 2007 in Larissa's 3‚Äì3 home draw with Levadiakos, followed it with another against Panathinaikos the following month. He ever-present in club's six-game UEFA Cup run, which included elimination of Blackburn Rovers FC. He made a positive impact in his first Superleague campaign, 2005/06, appearing in 27 of the team's 30 matches, helping them finish eighth a season after promotion. Olympiakos agreed with Larissa for the acquisition of 22 years' old defender, who will stay in the club till the end of the season. The transfer is closed to a fee of ‚Ç¨800,000 plus a 20% resale. Galitsios agreed to sign a five years' contract, while earnings will be graded starting from ‚Ç¨300,000 annually. =Olympiacos= A wholehearted right-back with tremendous stamina, Giorgios Galitsios joined Olympiakos in January 2008 after displaying consistent form over several seasons for provincial Greek club AEL and joined for the 2008‚Äì09 season. He played against a vital Champions League qualifier against Arsenal, but in the 75th minute he suffered a minor injury, which led to him being substituted. George Galitsios some years later stated that : \\"My character put me into trouble sometimes. Moreover, my eccentricity plays a key role in Olympiakos. It was a totally bad behavior\\". After three years, he succeeded to have only 45 appearances in all competitions with the club. =Panionios= On 28 January, he joined Panionios on a 6-month loan. The player had also an offer from his former club Larissa, but he preferred to join Panionios having the opportunity to play a key role replacing Giannis Maniatis. =Lokeren= During the winter of 2011-2012 he signed a contract at Koninklijke Sporting Club Lokeren in Belgium after being released from Olympiacos in July 2011. The former defender of Olympiakos is signed a six-month contract as Lokeren looking to cover the right side of its defense, concluding that Galitsios could be an ideal case. He was in search for a team after his training period with Werder Bremen. He made his debut with the club in a 1‚Äì1 away draw against Leuven. On 26 December 2013, he scored his first goal with the club in a 3‚Äì0 away win against Oostende. Galitsios signed for two more years with the club till the end of 2014/15 season, as the management of the club was completely satisfied with his performance and activated the option that existed in their agreement. The defender was surprised when he hears the news. \\"But it makes me happy of course. I feel good at Lokeren, Lokeren is satisfied with me. Club could unilaterally extend my contract. So that's happened now,\\" said Galitsios. Lokeren coach Peter Maes gives some explanation. \\"'Gali' is a player that you can always count on. Moreover, he has made tremendous progress in the last year and a half. Initially he was a Greek, he is now more 'European'. I mean football for him was more of a game, and now is more of a job. In terms of efficiency, professionalism and discipline in the game has grown tremendously, in line with club expectations.\\" On 22 March 2014, Lokeren fired a second Belgian Cup in three seasons in his pocket. Lokeren won with the smallest difference from Zulte Waregem. \\"This is an important victory in the history of the club,\\" said Giorgos Galitsios afterwards. \\"Lokeren already picks up a second trophy in three seasons. Lokeren is simply a top club.\\" \\"It was a hard fought victory\\", the defender continued. \\"But that's normal for a finale, huh. Though we eventually did have the better of the game. So I can say that we are a deserved winner.\\" Georgios Galitsios is another season under contract with Sporting Lokeren. However, the Greek right back enjoying interest from Panathinaikos, but Lokeren, however, would require a half million euros for the 27-year-old defender. Lokeren technical director Willy Reynders revealed that Giorgos Galitsios has taken the decision to return to Greece at the end of the 2014/15 season confirming SDNA reports.‚ÄúI think that Galitsios has taken his decision. He is a father and he wants to return back to Greece. But this decisions come along with its effects. Nonetheless, we've got Melnjak as an alternative solution,‚Äù Reynders said. Galitsios has 137 appearances (1 goal, 14 assists) with the club in four years. After a period of six months as a free agent, Galitsios is ready to return to his former team Lokeren. The 29-year-old player six months after he terminated his contract with the Belgian club, which came close to return in Greece for PAOK this January, besides the interest of K√∂ln, Nurnberg and APOEL spent four years with the club. He will sign a 1.5 years contract on a fee of ‚Ç¨500,000 with bonuses. On 13 February 2016, he made his debut with the club in a 3‚Äì3 away draw against Leuven, as a substitute. On 7 May 2016, he scored his second goal in Belgian Pro League in a home win against Mechelen. He started the 2016-17 season as the indisputable leader of the right side. On 1 July 2017, he solved his contract with the club. He waited for signing to Cypriot First Division champions APOEL, along with the club's possible qualification in the UEFA Champions League group stage and George Donis's promise that he would sign a contract. APOEL's non-qualification deprived not only the contract with the Cypriots, but also a contract with Belgian club Antwerp. =Mouscron= On 29 January 2018, after a period of six months as a free agent, he signed a six-month contract with Mouscron until the end of the season with an option of renewing his contract for one year more.Œ•œÄŒ≠Œ≥œÅŒ±œàŒµ œÉœÑŒ∑ ŒúŒøœÖœÉŒ∫œÅœåŒΩ Œø ŒìŒπœéœÅŒ≥ŒøœÇ ŒìŒ∫Œ±ŒªŒØœÑœÉŒπŒøœÇ On 3 February 2018, in his debut with the club he faced a muscle injury so he had to be replaced in a 0‚Äì1 home loss game against Genk. On 28 March 2018, it was announced that the 32-year-old defender renewed his contract with Mouscron until the summer of 2019 by activating the option in his contract for another year. At the same day, after many years of residence in Belgium, the Greek defender settled all the necessary documents and has acquired the Belgian citizenship. =Anorthosis= On 20 May 2019, Galitsios signed a two years' contract with Cypriot club Anorthosis for an undisclosed fee.

Discovered and isolated by Nancy Kedersha and Leonard Rome in 1986, vaults are cytoplasmic organelles which when negative-stained and viewed under an electron microscope resemble the arches of a cathedral vaulted ceiling, with 39-fold (Or D39d) symmetry. They are present in many types of eukaryotic cells and appear to be highly conserved amongst eukaryotes.  Morphology  Vaults are large ribonucleoprotein particles. About 3 times the size of a ribosome and weighing approximately 13 MDa, they are found in most eukaryotic cells and all higher eukaryotes. They measure 34 nm by 60 nm from a negative stain, 26 nm by 49 nm from cryo-electron microscopy, and 35 nm by 59 nm from STEM. The vaults consist primarily of proteins, making it difficult to stain with conventional techniques. The protein structure consists of an outer shell composed of 78 copies of the ~100 KDa major vault protein (MVP). Inside are two associated vault proteins, TEP1 and VPARP. TEP1, also known as the telomerase-associated protein 1, is 290 KDa and VPARP (also known as PARP4) is related to poly-(ADP- ribose) polymerase (PARP) and is 193 KDa. Vaults from higher eukaryotes also contain one or several small vault RNAs (vRNAs, also known as vtRNAs) of 86‚Äì141 bases within.  Function  Despite not being fully elucidated, vaults have been associated with the nuclear pore complexes and their octagonal shape appears to support this. Vaults have been implicated in a broad range of cellular functions including nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, mRNA localization, drug resistance, cell signaling, nuclear pore assembly, and innate immunity. The three vault proteins (MVP, VPARP, and TEP1) have each been knocked out individually and in combination (VPARP and TEP1) in mice. All of the knockout mice are viable and no major phenotypic alterations have been observed. Dictyostelium encode three different MVPs, two of which have been knocked out singly and in combination. The only phenotype seen in the Dictyostelium double knockout was growth retardation under nutritional stress. If vaults are involved in an essential cellular functions, it seems likely that redundant systems exist that can ameliorate their loss.  Association with cancer  In the late 1990s, researchers found that vaults (especially the MVP) were over- expressed in cancer patients who were diagnosed with multidrug resistance, that is the resistance against many chemotherapy treatments. Although this does not prove that increased number of vaults led to drug resistance, it does hint at some sort of involvement. This has potential in discovering the mechanisms behind drug-resistance in tumor cells and improving anticancer drugs.  Evolutionary conservation  Vaults have been identified in mammals, amphibians, avians and Dictyostelium discoideum. The Vault model used by the Pfam database identifies homologues in Paramecium tetraurelia, Kinetoplastida, many vertebrates, a cnidarian (starlet sea anemone), molluscs, Trichoplax adhaerens, flatworms, Echinococcus granulosus and Choanoflagellate. http://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF01505 Major Vault Protein repeat Pfam family Although vaults have been observed in many eukaryotic species, a few species do not appear to have the ribonucleoprotein. These include: *Arabidopsis thaliana‚Äîa small flowering plant related to cabbage and mustard. *Caenorhabditis elegans‚Äîa free-living nematode that lives in soil. *Drosophila melanogaster‚Äîa two-winged insect also known as a fruit fly. *Saccharomyces cerevisiae‚Äîa species of yeast. These four species are model organisms for plants, nematodes, animal genetics and fungi respectively. Despite these exceptions, the high degree of similarity of vaults in organisms that do have them implies some sort of evolutionary importance.  Vault engineering  The Rome lab at UCLA has collaborated with a number of groups to use the baculovirus system to produce large quantities of vaults. When the major vault protein (MVP) is expressed in insect cells, vault particles are assembled on polyribosomes in the cytoplasm. By using molecular genetic techniques to modify the gene encoding the major vault protein, vault particles have been produced with chemically active peptides attached to their sequence. These modified proteins are incorporated into the inside of the vault particle without altering its basic structure. Proteins and peptides can also be packaged into vaults by attachment of a packaging domain derived from the VPARP protein. A number of modified vault particles have been produced in order to test the concept that vaults can be bio-engineered to allow their use in a wide variety of biological applications including drug delivery, biological sensors, enzyme delivery, controlled release, and environmental remediation. A vault has been packaged with a chemokine for potential use to activate the immune system to attack lung cancer, and this approach has undergone phase I trials.

The third named storm of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season, Cristobal developed on August 5 near the coast of South Carolina from the same trough that spawned Tropical Storm Bertha. The storm tracked slowly southeastward in the early portion of its duration, and initially remained disorganized. Cristobal attained peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h), and lost the characteristics of a tropical cyclone on August 8. The remnants brought moderate precipitation to Bermuda, and in combination with a high pressure system the storm caused three drownings on Long Island from rip currents. Meteorological history A trough extended from the northern Gulf of Mexico to the western Atlantic Ocean in early August. The trough remained nearly stationary, spawning Tropical Storm Bertha in the Gulf of Mexico and a tropical disturbance off the coast of South Carolina. The weak low pressure area off South Carolina drifted southward, with its associated deep convection increasing in organization on August 4. By 1800 UTC on August 5, the system had acquired sufficient organization to be classified as Tropical Depression Three, while located about 175 miles (280 km/h) east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. Upon becoming a tropical depression, the cyclone maintained outer rainbands and fair outflow. It tracked southeastward around the northeastern periphery of an anticyclone over Florida. By August 6, the convection had diminished as outflow became restricted due to northeasterly wind shear; with a relatively dry environment, most of the convection was confined to the southern semicircle of the depression. Despite the circulation becoming elongated in the southwesterly flow of a southward moving cold front, a Hurricane Hunters flight late on August 6 reported that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Cristobal about 315 miles (505 km) east of Jacksonville, Florida. Tropical Storm Cristobal initially continued tracking southeastward, with its circulation reforming closer to the thunderstorms during each increase in convection. On August 7 the storm turned eastward, due to the influence of a large approaching mid to upper-level frontal zone. As the convection organized further, Cristobal intensified somewhat and attained peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). On August 8, increased dry air weakened the convection and caused Cristobal to accelerate east-northeastward. The low-level circulation interacted with the approaching frontal zone, and by 0000 UTC on August 9 Tropical Storm Cristobal was absorbed by the cold front about 350 miles (560 km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The remnants continued northeastward, passing near Newfoundland on August 10 before weakening near Greenland on August 14. Impact As a tropical cyclone, Cristobal had minimal effects on land. However, its remnants brought unsettled conditions to Bermuda, including a 45 mph (72 km/h) wind gust at the Bermuda International Airport. The combination of moisture from Cristobal and cold front into which it was absorbed produced 2.78 inches (71 mm) of rain there in a 24‚Äëhour period. An annual powerboat race circumnavigating Bermuda had to be postponed by a week because of the adverse weather. Although Cristobal remained offshore during its evolution, rough seas and rip currents were felt along portions of the U.S. East Coast. On August 9, lifeguards in Volusia County, Florida, rescued about 25 swimmers caught in rip currents. Offshore winds from the storm were credited with ending a widespread outbreak of jellyfish stings affecting bathers along the northern Atlantic coast of Florida. Some 1,000 stings had been reported. Two ships recorded tropical storm force winds in association with the storm; one of them, a vessel with the call sign WUQL, reported sustained winds of 47 mph (76 km/h) from the west-southwest on August 7, while located about northeast of Great Abaco. Later, the extratropical remnants of Cristobal continued to interact with a high pressure system over the Mid-Atlantic states to generate dangerous swimming conditions further north. Along the south shore of Long Island, New York, significant wave heights reached 4 feet (1.2 m), and rip currents resulted in three drowning deaths on August 10: one in Montauk; one just east of Moriches Inlet; and one off Rockaway Beach. In the latter case, the victim had become exhausted after swimming out to save his son-in-law, an inexperienced swimmer, from the rip current.

In most instances, pilot vehicles are provided by companies that specialize in convoy escort, although escort duties are occasionally performed by police vehicles (especially for parades and funeral processions or shipments that require a high level of security during transit). Some escort companies have special authority for traffic control through state approval. Oversize vehicle escorts Pilot/escort vehicles are public safety vehicles; they are also considered a warning device to forewarn the public of a potential danger. They are usually equipped with a C.B. radio, or other two-way radios to communicate with each other. On a two-lane road, a load with one escort takes position in front of the load being escorted, on a four or more lane road the escort then transitions behind the truck being escorted. Depending on the size of the load, the load may require more escorts, usually one in the front and one in the rear. For overwidth or overheight trucks one escort vehicle will drive 2500' to 1 miles ahead of the truck to ensure the road ahead can accommodate the truck's oversize dimensions. This lead vehicle is usually equipped with a long pole (high-pole) that extends upward from the front bumper; its length is adjusted six to eight inches above the height of the truck's load or the tallest part of the load within a convoy. If the pole strikes any overhanging objects such as bridges, overhead signs, or power lines, the truck or convoy can be alerted and stopped or diverted long before an accident occurs. In Australia all oversize equipment is imported in pieces on cargo ships; the components are then loaded onto trucks that are powerful enough to haul the extremely heavy machinery. In New South Wales, oversize trucks are only allowed to operate between 11 pm and 5 am. If the truck is still in transit by 5 am, it must by law pull over to a safe area and wait until 11 pm to continue its journey. Along the predetermined route, which is already safe-proof from narrow roads and low objects through many years of transportation of heavy oversize machines, the front escort must have amber safety lights that can be seen from 360¬∞ and from at least 500 feet. A sign displaying \\"Oversize Load\\" must be on the front and the rear of the escort vehicle, or one sign that displays \\"Oversize Load\\" on both sides may be mounted on top of the vehicle, the sign must be at least 5 feet wide and 12 inches high, with eight inch letters with a 2-inch brush stroke. The front escort is to ensure that oncoming vehicles are warned of the oversized load approaching. Because it is illegal for the front pilot/escort to cross the line into the oncoming lane, it can be difficult to get traffic to stop for something such as a narrow bridge, so the front escort usually goes far enough in advance to warn the truck driver via C.B. radio about the oncoming traffic so the driver can stop before the bridge until the front driver relays back to the driver that it is safe to cross without the fear of oncoming traffic. The rear pilot/escort may perform duties such as staying in one or more lanes other than the lanes that the truck and load are occupying, to block traffic off while the truck and trailer make their turn. The rear escort may also make sudden lane changes, usually because the truck needs to change lanes because of a lane ending or obstruction in the road ahead, or one or more vehicles parked on the shoulder of the road. Abnormal load escort vehicle for wind turbine blade transport In the UK in 2017 Heavy Transport Association launched a road safety initiative centred on two new Certificates of Competence issued by the City & Guilds for the drivers and managers of abnormal load Escorts. The aim of the initiative is to improve public safety through training of abnormal load escorts leading to improved competence. At the moment anyone 21 or over with a car licence, a vehicle, some amber flashing lights and an Abnormal Load sign can become an escort without any training, knowledge of the legislation or a check of competence. There are two levels of courses City & Guilds Level 2 Certificate of Competence in Abnormal Loads (Escort Driver) and City & Guilds Level 3 Certificate of Competence in Abnormal Loads (Escort Manager)aimed to improve road safety and to equip individuals with the required skills to sufficiently undertake the task of escorting abnormal loads or abnormal load vehicles.

The eleventh named storm and fifth hurricane of the season, Kenneth developed from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone to the southwest of Mexico on September 14. It quickly attained peak winds of 135 mph (215 km/h) on September 18, before weakening due to increased wind shear and turning to a southwest drift. After weakening to tropical storm status, Kenneth attained a steady west-northwest motion and encountered favorable enough conditions for it to gain power and attain hurricane status on September 25. The cyclone again weakened as its motion halted, and on September 30 Kenneth dissipated a short distance off the Big Island of Hawaii. The remnants of Kenneth produced one of the highest rainfall totals in Hawaii, reaching up to 12 inches (305 mm) on Oahu. The rainfall caused flooding, though no major damage was reported. Meteorological history The origins of Kenneth are believed to have been from a tropical wave that crossed Central America into the eastern North Pacific Ocean on September 9. The system tracked westward within the Intertropical Convergence Zone ‚Äî a belt of thunderstorm activity across the eastern Pacific Ocean ‚Äî and on September 13 its associated thunderstorm activity began showing signs of organization. Despite being located only 625 miles (1010 km) east-southeast of the larger Tropical Depression Ten, the National Hurricane Center remarked the potential for further development of the system; as the depression was further west and moving faster than the system, little interference from Jova was anticipated. The system organized further, and at 1800 UTC on September 14 the National Hurricane Center began classifying it as Tropical Depression Eleven about 900 miles (1450 km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The depression maintained a general westward track throughout its entire duration, due to the subtropical ridge to its north. Initially, the depression was forecast to reach maximum strength as a tropical storm before weakening, and only the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's hurricane model predicted it to attain hurricane status. However, low amounts of wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures favored further intensification. After being previously removed from the primary thunderstorm activity, the circulation became situated beneath a persistent area of deep convection. It is estimated the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Kenneth early on September 15. The storm quickly developed banding features‚Äîspiral rain showers of convection‚Äîas its convection formed into a central area of deep convection. These were all signs for further development, and Kenneth attained hurricane status early on September 16. By September 17, the hurricane had finished an eyewall replacement cycle, meaning its original eye was replaced by a larger, better defined eye. As a result, it quickly intensified and attained major hurricane status. With a 23-mile (37 km) wide eye surrounded by very cold cloud tops, Kenneth strengthened to reach peak sustained winds of 135 mph (215 km/h), a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, on September 18 about 1725 miles (2790 km) east of the Big Island of Hawaii. After maintaining peak strength for about 18 hours, Kenneth began a sharp weakening trend due to unfavorable north-northeasterly wind shear; this was caused by the anticyclone over Hurricane Jova, which eroded the eyewall of Hurricane Kenneth. While weakening, the hurricane turned to a southwest drift, due to a weakness in steering currents. By September 20, its deepest convection was confined to the southern half of the hurricane, and later in the day Kenneth weakened to tropical storm status. Reduced moisture in the atmosphere weakened the system further, and by September 21 its circulation was exposed to the east-northeast of the convection. Kenneth began a steady west-northwest track due to a weak ridge to its north. Operationally the storm was predicted to continue weakening and dissipate within four days. However, deep convection re- developed near the center as the outflow became better defined, and Kenneth remained a moderate tropical storm for several days. On September 24, the motion became nearly stationary as steering currents again weakened. Vertical shear sharply declined, allowing the convection to become more symmetrical and for an eye feature to develop. On September 25, Kenneth again attained hurricane status while located about 1085 miles (1745 km) east-southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii. Hurricane Kenneth maintained minimal hurricane status for about 30 hours as it drifted southwestward, during which it entered the area of responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. Increasing shear weakened Kenneth to tropical storm status on September 26, and it began a steady northwest track under the influence of low- to mid-level steering flow. By September 27, most of its convection had dissipated, excluding a small area of thunderstorms to the southeast of the center. Convection intermittently reformed near the center, though the combination of wind shear and cooler water temperatures prevented restrengthening. On September 29, an intensifying upper-level trough over the Hawaiian Islands weakened Kenneth to tropical depression status. Thunderstorms failed to reform, and on September 30 it degenerated into a tropical wave about 40 miles (65 km) east of the Big Island of Hawaii. A remnant swirl of clouds later moved onshore of the Big Island. Impact and aftermath Satellite image of Hurricane Jova (left), Kenneth (center), and Tropical Storm Max (right) The remnants of Kenneth produced rainfall in the Hawaiian Islands when they interacted with an upper- level trough, causing some reports of flash flooding. At Nu‚Äòuanu Pali on Oahu, a gauge recorded a total precipitation of 10.25 inches (260.4 mm); the gauge also reported 1.6 inches (40 mm) in 15 minutes, as well as 4.11 inches (104 mm) in one hour. Peak rainfall totals on Oahu included reports of up to 12 inches (305 mm), which puts Kenneth in a three-way tie for ninth on Hawaii's rainiest tropical cyclones list, along with Diana in 1972 and a system dubbed \\"B\\" from the 1967 season. On October 1, rains caused the Kaukonahua Stream to burst its banks and Lake Wilson to overflow behind the Wahiawa Dam. The rainfall produced up to 1 foot (300 mm) of flowing water on Pali Highway, leading to surface runoff which flooded a few homes. On Kauai, the six-hour total at Mount Waialeale was 6.17 inches (157 mm). Flash flooding occurred on the Hanalei River, which resulted in the closure of the Kuhio Highway at the Hanalei Bridge. Rapid water level rises also occurred on the Wailua River and the Hanapepe River, though no significant damages were reported along these waterways. Large swells churned up by Kenneth generated surf of 8-10 ft (2-3 m) that crashed ashore on September 30 along the east shores of the islands of Hawaii, Kauai, Molokai, Maui, and Oahu. No reports of injuries or serious damage were received. During the 61st Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference, the Hawaii State Civil Defense requested the retirement of the name Kenneth, citing that the storm had become memorable due to threat or damage. However, the World Meteorological Organization did not approve the request, and the name was reused for the 2011 season.

History The Jacksonville Port Authority replaced the city's Department of Docks and Terminals and was created in 1963 by Florida's Legislature to progress, preserve, and promote the city's port facilities. The Port Authority was chartered by the state, and intended to be a government entity that would operate like a business; however, it received 1.5 mils of property tax authority that generated nearly half a million dollars during 1963 (equivalent to $30 million in 2003). Jacksonville airports were under the control of the Port Authority since its inception, but in May 2001, the Florida State Legislature approved the restructuring of the Jacksonville Port Authority into two separate entities (City J-Bill-1104); the Jacksonville Aviation Authority (JAA) and the Jacksonville Seaport Authority effective October 1, 2001. In 2003, the act was amended to reinstate the name Jacksonville Port Authority instead of Seaport. Function Jacksonville‚Äôs port is one of the largest commercial cargo ports on the Atlantic Coast. JAXPORT controls docks and wharfs, cranes, a passenger cruise terminal, warehouses, paved open storage areas, and road connections to the public highway system. JPA maintains these facilities and manages their overall use. As of October 2011, only JAXPORT security officers and off-duty members of the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office are involved in handling calls for service on property owned by JAXPORT. =Governance= The JPA is governed by a seven-member Board of Directors. The Mayor of Jacksonville appoints four Board members, and the Florida Governor appoints three members. Each member serves a four-year, unpaid term. From its membership, the Board elects its own Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary, and Treasurer for one-year terms. =Funding= Tax dollars are not used to fund JAXPORT's operating expenses. Private companies lease space and equipment at the port, and that revenue is used to fund port operations. In 2010 JAXPORT recorded $50.6 million in operating revenues, and $32 million in operating expenses. The authority does receive state and federal grants to pay for construction (capital) and security projects. JAXPORT itself has no authority to assess taxes. =Economic impact= Due to the local maritime industry Jacksonville's maritime industry supports more than 65,000 employees. These include private sector jobs such as longshoremen, crane operators, truck drivers, warehouse workers, and others working in industries which rely on the port. =Initiatives= * Expand Port Business, which would create new jobs and stimulate the economy in northeast Florida * Increase Cruise Business, which would increase income from tourism * Deepen The Harbor, which would allow \\"supersized\\" ships to dock. When the current Panama Canal expansion project is completed in 2014, jumbo ships from China will utilize it and dock at Atlantic Ocean ports. To remain competitive, Jacksonville must be able to host these ships. Seaport services and facilities=Cargo operations= Every year, imported and exported goods are shipped from more than 100 countries through the Jacksonville port. In this harbor, the Jacksonville Port Authority owns the JAXPORT Cruise Terminal and three cargo terminals: the Blount Island Marine Terminal, Talleyrand Marine Terminal and Dames Point Marine Terminal. =Cruise operations= Carnival Cruise Lines utilizes the JAXPORT Cruise Terminal to offer year-round service on the Carnival Ecstasy to Key West and the Bahamas. The authority intends to relocate the terminal. =Ferry service= The St. Johns River Ferry (also known as the Mayport Ferry) has provided service across the 9/10 mile between Mayport and Fort George Island since the 1874.Manwell, Frank: \\"Steamboat Bill, 2007\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, S. E. AND GULF PORTS The Florida Department of Transportation had always been responsible for the ferry, but its funding was vetoed by Governor Charlie Crist for the 2007-2008 budget. The City of Jacksonville assumed the responsibility in 2007, and spent $1 million more than the income from fares. After Mayor John Peyton announced that there was no money available in the 2008 budget, JAXPORT took over operation of the ferry and lost half a million dollars each year, but used port revenue, not tax money, to underwrite the expense.Dixon, Drew: \\"Mayport ferry ridership down, some worried service could go away\\" Florida Times-Union, July 1, 2009 The ferry service operator is Hornblower Marine Services. In 2012 JAXPORT announced that it would no longer be responsible for the ferry. In response, the city commission created the new St. Johns River Ferry Commission. JAXPORT agreed to contribute $200,000 toward operations, the city of Jacksonville kicked in $200,000 with the state DOT paying $250,000. Private facilities JAXPORT facilities do not handle all the cargo moving over the St. Johns River. In fact, more than 20 maritime facilities in Jacksonville's harbor are owned and operated by other entities. These facilities include private dry docks, petroleum terminals, and military bases. The JPA does not operate or manage private boat marinas, water taxis, bridges, or the Northbank and Southbank Riverwalks.

He was important in the development of the lighter kind of madrigal current in the 1570s related to the villanella, and was influential as far away as England. Life His place of origin is uncertain, and both Venice and Ancona have been claimed as cities of his birth. The earliest documents of his career show him already to be employed as the maestro di cappella, the choirmaster, at the cathedral of Ancona in 1575. The next two decades have gaps, but some dates of employment are known. Between 1580 and 1582 he was at Loreto; from 1586 to 1588 at Gemona; in 1589 at Cividale del Friuli; and in 1596 he is recorded as being at Loreto again, this time as maestro di cappella at Santa Casa, a position he held until 1603. A reference to him in 1609 indicates he was still alive then, possibly living in Rome, and various other bits of evidence ‚Äì such as his music appearing in Roman collections, and his acquaintanceship with Roman musicians ‚Äì suggests that he may have spent part of his career there. When he died is not known, but it was likely after 1609.Fenlon, Grove online Works and influence Ferretti's music epitomizes the lightness of texture and subject matter which was one of the several diverging trends in secular vocal music composition in Italy in the last half of the 16th century. While few of his compositions were titled \\"madrigal\\", they may be seen as part of the broad continuum of secular music of which madrigals were a part. Most of his works were canzoni alla napolitana, canzonas in the Neapolitan style, a light form of villanella (with a rhyme scheme of , but with the individual lines elaborated in the manner of the madrigal). While composers had been writing villanelle for a long time, Ferretti was the first to bring madrigalian characteristics to the form.Einstein, V. II p. 593-4 The complete published output of Ferretti consists of books of canzoni alla napolitana. He published two books for six voices, in 1573 and 1575, and a total of five books for five voices, in 1567, 1569, 1570, 1571, and 1585; all works appeared in Venice. To say they sold well and established his fame is an understatement; reprints and new editions appeared throughout Europe, in places as distant as Nuremberg, Antwerp, and London (in 1588). Ferretti's canzoni, along with the works of Orazio Vecchi, are considered to be the most important musical influence on the English madrigal style of Thomas Morley, which commenced in 1588 with the publication in England of Musica transalpina, a wildly popular collection of Italian madrigals fitted with English words. A few madrigals by Ferretti have survived, separately copied and not represented in his major printed editions. One of them is a celebration of the naval victory at the Battle of Lepanto (October 7, 1571), and is a coarse, abusive taunt of Sultan Selim, written in the dialect of the Venetian mariners who defeated his fleet.Einstein, V.

Part of the annual hurricane season, Greg originated from a tropical wave that departed Africa in mid-August. The wave entered the eastern Pacific by September 1, steadily organizing over subsequent days to become a tropical depression on September 5\\\\. Amid a favorable environment, the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Greg a few hours after formation and further organized into a Category 1 hurricane on September 6\\\\. Greg paralleled the southwestern coastline of Mexico, where it destroyed over 250 homes, cut-off roads, killed 10 people, and left at least 4,000 more injured. The storm weakened to tropical storm intensity as it moved ashore Baja California Sur, although rain was generally beneficial there. Succumbing to cooler waters and high wind shear, Greg ultimately dissipated over the Pacific on September 9\\\\. Its remnants led to thunderstorms across northern California, with only minor impacts. Meteorological history In mid-August, a tropical wave emerged off the western coast of Africa. The northern portion of the wave led to the formation of Tropical Storm Emily in the Atlantic, while the southern portion of the wave continued westward. It crossed Central America on August 31 and September 1, characterized by a large area of convection and a mid-level circulation. The disturbance traversed southern Mexico before emerging offshore, where it began to interact with a broad area of low pressure that existed in the eastern Pacific for several days prior. Shower and thunderstorm activity became concentrated about a well-defined center, leading to the formation of a tropical depression near Manzanillo, Mexico by 12:00 UTC on September 5\\\\. A portion of the tropical wave also combined with monsoonal-like flow across the Bay of Campeche to form Tropical Depression Seven in the Atlantic. Steered northwest by an anticyclone over northern Mexico and a developing upper-level low west of Southern California, the nascent cyclone steadily organized over warm waters. A ship about 105 mi (165 km) from the center reported sustained winds of 48 mph (77 km/h), supporting an upgrade to Tropical Storm Greg by 18:00 UTC on September 5. In spite of dissipating banding features, a large mass of extremely deep convection developed near the center that night. Radar out of Los Cabos indicated that an eye was in the process of forming by early on September 6, and Greg was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane in conjunction with satellite intensity estimates by 18:00 UTC that day. Six hours later, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 986 mbar (hPa; 29.12 inHg). Greg maintained its status for many more hours, even though outflow became restricted to the northeast and low- level cloud lines near the storm's eye became exposed. A band of convection formed northeast of Greg early on September 7, inducing moderate to strong northeasterly wind shear on the cyclone. Combined with land interaction, the storm weakened to tropical storm intensity by 18:00 UTC that day, and Greg made landfall near Cabo San Lucas three hours later, with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). After turning west-northwest and then west, the cyclone moved over progressively cooler waters and continued to lose strength, although a small area of deep convection persisted. Greg weakened to a tropical depression by 18:00 UTC on September 8 before succumbing to the unfavorable environment and dissipating a day later west of Baja California Sur. Preparations, impact, and aftermath Rainfall map Following Greg's formation, a tropical storm warning was issued for the coast of Mexico from Manzanillo, Colima to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, including Islas Mar√≠as. The warning was extended to include L√°zaro C√°rdenas a few hours later. On September 6, a tropical storm warning was issued for locations south of La Paz on the east coast of Baja California, while a tropical storm watch was hoisted for areas south of Punta Abreojos on the west coast. A tropical storm warning was then issued for the west coast of Baja California south of Cabo San L√°zaro. As Greg intensified, a hurricane warning was raised from Arroyo Seco southward, and for the east coast of Baja California from La Paz southward. A tropical storm watch was raised from north of La Paz to Loreto. Late on September 7, the hurricane warning was reduced to a tropical storm warning as Greg weakened. The watches and warnings were lifted from the east coast of Baja California early on September 8, and they were subsequently lifted for all areas a few hours later. In Acapulco, which had already suffered severe damage due to a harsh rainy season, residents piled sandbags in preparation for more precipitation. Ten shipping ports were closed. Over 240 people were evacuated in the state of Jalisco, 140 of which from the village of La Huerta. In addition, up to 850 people sought refuge in shelters across the state. Some 350 people from the municipality of Coahuayana and 150 people from the city of Coalcom√°n de V√°zquez Pallares ‚Äì both in Michoac√°n state ‚Äì were moved to safety. Merchants taped their store windows to protect them from strong winds while residents stocked up on water. In Cabo San Lucas on the southern tip of Baja California, authorities began evacuating low-lying areas as residents and tourists flooded supermarkets. Gas stations were filled with lines up to 0.5 mi (0.8 km) long. All traffic was closed to the ports of Cabo San Lucas and San Jos√© del Cabo. The Red Cross opened shelters at several local schools. Municipal authorities issued a red alert. Army and Navy representatives met to discuss rescue operations. About 1,000 people sought refuge in shelters across Cabo San Lucas and nearby San Jose del Cabo as the storm arrived. Most airline flights were canceled, frustrating tourists. As Greg passed offshore southwestern Mexico, its outer bands affected coastal locations. Coahuayana saw at least three villages and 200 homes flooded after a river overflowed its banks, while a stretch of highway connecting Acapulco to Zihuatanejo was washed out. Some minor flooding was reported in Acapulco. In the state of Oaxaca, mudslides were observed and at least 50 families had to be evacuated after the Perros River overflowed its banks. Around 800 people were evacuated across the state of Colima, where a storm-total rain amount of 22.32 in (567 mm) fell in Tecom√°n. Water systems in Manzanillo were damaged. Widespread flooding was observed, with water up to 7 ft (2 m) in some locations. In Jalisco, at least 8,000 residents were cut-off from the rest of the state, and up to 90% of the farmland near the municipalities of Autl√°n, Cihuatl√°n, and Casimiro Castillo was inundated as at least eight rivers overflowed. Up to 250 dwellings were destroyed across southwestern portions of Mexico. Over 4,000 additional people were injured, while up to 500 heads of cattle died in floodwaters. In Chiapas, dams exceeded 9 ft (3 m) their normal levels and other water systems were pushed past their intended usage due to the already severe rainy season. A state of emergency was declared in six states. Across the Baja California peninsula, shacks and hotels were filled with water, even as the rainfall was generally regarded as beneficial. In the aftermath of the cyclone, army jeeps transported supplies to flooded homes. At least 10 people were killed, including six deaths in Morelos, two deaths in Colima, and one death each in Chiapas and Michoac√°n. The remnants of Greg swept into northern California by September 8, producing more lightning activity than the region had experienced in at least two decades, as well as damaging a house after a tree struck by lightning fell on it. The thunderstorms downed power poles, cutting power to 55,000 residents, and sparked four wildfires across Monterey County. Some locations received up to 0.25 in (6.4 mm) of rain.

Geological features=Roche de Bout= The Roche de Bout or Roche de Boeuf (French for \\"rock of beef\\" or \\"buffalo rock\\") is a big limestone outcrop which forms an island near the center of the Maumee River. It was a landmark for early explorers and natives. The landmark was used by the Miami, Shawnee, Lenape and their allies as a location for councils. Leaders of these tribes met there before the Battle of Fallen Timbers with General Anthony Wayne in 1794, which was a pivotal battle for the settlement of the Northwest Territory. Aug. 19, 1794, Wayne built a fort on the bank of the river opposite the rock, named Fort Deposit, because it was a storage depot for ammo and supplies. The fort was abandoned after Wayne bivouacked the wounded there and returned to Fort Defiance.Historical Marker Dedication on Waterville Roche de Boeuf Day Waterville, Ohio Historical Society It was used as one of the supports for the now abandoned Interurban Bridge.

Builder Lima-Toledo Traction The bridge has been abandoned for many years. It was constructed by the Lima-Toledo Traction company, an early 1900s interurban trolley line that ran primarily adjacent to the Baltimore and Ohio steam railroad from Toledo to Lima and from there south to Springfield on a connecting interurban line, the Dayton, Springfield, and Urbana. Many Ohio interurban lines struggled financially from inception. In an attempt to create operational efficiency under one management, the L-T along with other Ohio interurbans was brought under lease control of the Ohio Electric corporation to form one large widespread Ohio interurban network. All equipment was relettered and operated as the Ohio Electric.Keegan: chapter 1 Financially the consolidation didn't work, and when the OE went bankrupt in 1921, the L-T returned to its former owners and operated as the Lima-Toledo Railroad. It continued interurban service between Toledo and Lima using its essential long bridge over the wide Maumee River. Final railway use by the Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad In 1929, two adjacent Ohio interurbans (the Cincinnati Hamilton and Dayton, and the Indiana, Columbus and Eastern) combined with the Lima-Toledo to form the 323 mile long Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad to establish interurban service from Toledo to distant Cincinnati. A branch operated from Springfield to Ohio's capitol Columbus.Keenan: ch. 2 and map. The corporate goal was to increase passenger business and particularly interurban freight business in this heavily industrialized part of Ohio. From 1929 to 1930, the C&LE; borrowed heavily to rebuild track and purchase new passenger and freight equipment in order to provide high speed operation between its major cities of Toledo, Lima, Springfield, Dayton, and Cincinnati. Starting at 1930, the C&LE; was successful and business increased particularly with freight shipments, but the collapsing national and local economy in the following years due to the Great Depression, numerous floods requiring very expensive track and facility reconstruction, competition from newly paved state highways carrying growing automobile and truck competition steadily reduced revenue and forced C&LE; abandonment in 1937. This was the last year that the unique Interurban Bridge saw rail traffic.Keegan: ch 6 On June 19, 1972, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places Reference and notesFurther reading *Keenan, Jack: The Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad: The Great Ohio Interurban. 1974. pp 226.

Because the free energy of a system is not simply a function of the phase space coordinates of the system, but is instead a function of the Boltzmann-weighted integral over phase space (i.e. partition function), the free energy difference between two states cannot be calculated directly from the potential energy of just two coordinate sets (for state A and B respectively). In thermodynamic integration, the free energy difference is calculated by defining a thermodynamic path between the states and integrating over ensemble-averaged enthalpy changes along the path. Such paths can either be real chemical processes or alchemical processes. An example alchemical process is the Kirkwood's coupling parameter method.  Derivation  Consider two systems, A and B, with potential energies U_A and U_B. The potential energy in either system can be calculated as an ensemble average over configurations sampled from a molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulation with proper Boltzmann weighting. Now consider a new potential energy function defined as: :U(\\\\lambda) = U_A + \\\\lambda(U_B - U_A) Here, \\\\lambda is defined as a coupling parameter with a value between 0 and 1, and thus the potential energy as a function of \\\\lambda varies from the energy of system A for \\\\lambda = 0 and system B for \\\\lambda = 1. In the canonical ensemble, the partition function of the system can be written as: :Q(N, V, T, \\\\lambda) = \\\\sum_{s} \\\\exp [-U_s(\\\\lambda)/k_{B}T] In this notation, U_s(\\\\lambda) is the potential energy of state s in the ensemble with potential energy function U(\\\\lambda) as defined above. The free energy of this system is defined as: :F(N,V,T,\\\\lambda)=-k_{B}T \\\\ln Q(N,V,T,\\\\lambda), If we take the derivative of F with respect to Œª, we will get that it equals the ensemble average of the derivative of potential energy with respect to Œª. :\\\\Delta F(A \\\\rightarrow B) = \\\\int_0^1 \\\\frac{\\\\partial F(\\\\lambda)}{\\\\partial\\\\lambda} d\\\\lambda = -\\\\int_0^1 \\\\frac{k_{B}T}{Q} \\\\frac{\\\\partial Q}{\\\\partial\\\\lambda} d\\\\lambda = \\\\int_0^1 \\\\frac{k_{B}T}{Q} \\\\sum_{s} \\\\frac{1}{k_{B}T} \\\\exp[- U_s(\\\\lambda)/k_{B}T ] \\\\frac{\\\\partial U_s(\\\\lambda)}{\\\\partial \\\\lambda} d\\\\lambda = \\\\int_0^1 \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\partial U(\\\\lambda)}{\\\\partial\\\\lambda}\\\\right\\\\rangle_{\\\\lambda} d\\\\lambda = \\\\int_0^1 \\\\left\\\\langle U_B(\\\\lambda) - U_A(\\\\lambda) \\\\right\\\\rangle_{\\\\lambda} d\\\\lambda The change in free energy between states A and B can thus be computed from the integral of the ensemble averaged derivatives of potential energy over the coupling parameter \\\\lambda.Frenkel, Daan and Smit, Berend. Understanding Molecular Simulation: From Algorithms to Applications. Academic Press, 2007 In practice, this is performed by defining a potential energy function U(\\\\lambda), sampling the ensemble of equilibrium configurations at a series of \\\\lambda values, calculating the ensemble- averaged derivative of U(\\\\lambda) with respect to \\\\lambda at each \\\\lambda value, and finally computing the integral over the ensemble-averaged derivatives. Umbrella sampling is a related free energy method. It adds a bias to the potential energy. In the limit of an infinite strong bias it is equivalent to thermodynamic integration.

It is a station on the MBTA Commuter Rail Newburyport/Rockport Line and a hub for the MBTA bus system. The station consists of a single center island platform serving the two station tracks on an elevated grade. A large parking garage is integrated into the station structure. Service on the Eastern Railroad through Lynn began on August 27, 1838. The original wooden station was replaced by a larger structure in 1848, and the Saugus Branch began serving Lynn in 1855. In the \\"Great Lynn Depot War\\", a local disagreement in 1865 about where to place a replacement station became a major court case. It ended in 1872 with the construction of stations at two closely spaced sites, though one was soon torn down. The other station burned in 1889; it was replaced in 1895 by a depot with a large clock tower. The Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;), which had acquired the Eastern in 1883, began a grade separation project through Lynn in 1909 ‚Äì part of an attempt to quadruple-track the whole line. Completed in 1914, it expanded the station to four tracks and two island platforms, with the 1895-built structure modified \\"not for the better\\". It was replaced in 1952 by a modernist brick structure. Saugus Branch service ended in 1958; service on the mainline was subsidized beginning in 1965 by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). The MBTA opened a new accessible island platform in 1992, along with a large parking garage that anticipated a never-realized extension of the Blue Line. Lynn is also a major bus transfer point serving eleven MBTA bus routes in the North Shore region, including routes leading to Salem, Marblehead, Wonderland, and the Liberty Tree Mall as well as downtown Boston. In 2003, the bus routes were moved to a busway adjacent to the garage. History=Early history= Early image of the 1838 station Woodcutting of the 1848 station After the railroads from Boston to Lowell, Worcester, and Providence were chartered in 1830 and 1831, railroads to other surrounding cities including Newburyport and Portsmouth were proposed. The Eastern Railroad was chartered on April 14, 1836. Work began at East Boston in late 1836; it reached Lynn in the spring of 1837, but construction was slowed by the Panic of 1837 and did not reach Salem until 1838. Service from Salem to East Boston began on August 27, 1838, with fares half that of competing stagecoaches. The line through Lynn was built at surface level. A number of stations have served Lynn, including a series of stations near the current location at Central Square as well as a number of other stations around the city. The first depot at the Central Square location, built in 1838, was a small wooden building. The station was the site of an early protest against the discrimination of African-Americans in transportation. On September 29, 1841, noted abolitionist Frederick Douglass and friend James N. Buffum (later mayor of Lynn) were thrown from an Eastern Railroad train when Douglass refused to sit in the segregated train coach. Trains were ordered to not stop at Lynn for several days out of concern that the citizens of Lynn would cause additional incidents. On June 16, 1846, the stockholders authorized the sale of $450,000 of new stock to fund various branch lines plus new depots at Salem and Lynn. The 1838-built station was replaced in 1848 by a brick building with a 2-track train shed, modeled after the 1847-built station at Salem but smaller and lacking towers. In 1845 and 1846, a line from Malden to Salem via Saugus and Lynnfield was proposed but did not pass the legislature due to bitter objections from the Eastern. Instead, the Saugus Branch Railroad opened from Malden to Lynn Common on February 1, 1853. Affiliated with the Eastern's primary rival, the Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;), it did not initially have a connection with the Eastern. In 1855, the Eastern acquired the majority stock of the Saugus Branch Railroad to keep it away from the B&M.; The connection to the B&M; at Malden was severed, and it was connected to the Eastern at South Malden (Everett) and West Lynn. Lynn became the primary turnback point for the Saugus Branch after 1855, though a limited number of trains continued to Salem until World War I. The first horsecars ran to Lynn in 1854 under the Lynn and Boston Street Railway. Its line ran between its namesake cities; running through Charlestown on Chelsea Street, Chelsea and Revere on Broadway, then along the Salem Turnpike to Lynn. On November 19, 1888, the Highland Circuit route of the Lynn & Boston became the first electrified trolley line in Massachusetts. =Great Lynn Depot War= Market Street station under construction in 1872 When the Eastern Railroad prepared to build a new depot in 1865, a great deal of controversy erupted ‚Äì an event later known as the \\"Great Lynn Depot War\\". One faction wanted the replacement station built at the same Central Square location, while another wanted it built at Knight's Crossing, a block southwest at Market Street. The Central Square faction was aided by a bill passed in the Massachusetts legislature on April 29, 1865, which disallowed a railroad from abandoning a station that had been in service more than five years, as well as an 1868 bill that specifically directed the Eastern Railroad to build the replacement station at Central Square. After a case which reached the Supreme Court in 1871 and a subsequent appeal to the United States Court, a decision was ultimately made to construct stations at both locations. Both the Central Square and Market Street stations were in service by mid-1872, but it was untenable for the railroad to serve two stations just several hundred feet apart. The Market Street station was demolished in 1873 and replaced with a wooden shelter that served only a handful of trains. The depot controversy was a setback for the Eastern Railroad in a city where residents were already dissatisfied with poor service. In 1872, the Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad (BRB&L;) was charted as a direct competitor to the Eastern; service began from Market Street in 1875 and lasted until 1940. Service to East Boston had been replaced with direct service to Boston via the Grand Junction Railroad in 1854, but Lynn‚ÄìEast Boston service was run from 1872 to 1880 to compete with the BRB&L.; In 1880, the service was cut to a Revere‚ÄìEast Boston shuttle,which lasted until 1905. From approximately the 1850s to the 1930s, Lynn was the terminus for some short turn Boston commuter trains. From 1881 to 1892, some of these trains ran via the Chelsea Beach Branch during the summer. =Track elevation= 1895-built station before the grade separation project The 1872 Central Square station burned in 1889 and was replaced with a temporary station until a new depot with a 75-foot clock tower was built in 1895 on the north side of the tracks off Union Street. This station had two side platforms to serve the line's two tracks. As early as 1901, the city began planning to eliminate the numerous grade crossings in downtown Lynn. With 150 trains per day on the main line and 40 on the Saugus Branch, some streets were blocked for as long as half of daylight hours. After legal issues, construction of an elevated viaduct began in September 1909. However, the New Haven Railroad briefly gained control of the Boston and Maine at this time, and intended to fully four-track the line through Lynn in conjunction with plans including a possible railroad tunnel under the harbor. The municipality initially intended to force the railroad to depress the four- track line below grade, but later reached an agreement with the railroad to modify the two-track viaduct for four tracks. The New Haven's plan to four- track the line as far as the branch line splits in Salem and Beverly was stymied by the costs to modify the grade crossings in Chelsea and the single- track tunnel at Salem. The only quadruple track to become operational was at Lynn station itself, with two island platforms to serve trains on all tracks. The depot was modified \\"not for the better\\" in conjunction with the elevation project. Many of the four-track bridge spans in Lynn, never used operationally, are still extant. =B&M; era= An MBTA train passes the 1914-built old inbound island platform Streetcars service to Lynn continued under the Lynn & Boston until 1901 when it became part of the Boston & Northern Street Railway. By the early 20th century, a number of lines crisscrossed Lynn, with a number of them serving the station. The Bay State Street Railway took over operations in 1911 and joined the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway in 1919. Trolley service in Lynn lasted until 1938. The Boston and Maine Railroad built a new, more modern station in 1952 but reused the 1914-built platforms. This single-story building, located on the south side of the tracks at Mt. Vernon and Exchange streets, was in the same flat-roofed brick style as Winchester Center and Wedgemere built five years later. The building was the first on the Boston & Maine system to have radiant heat, and also included a restaurant and newsstand. The 1895-built station was demolished to make room for a parking lot. Saugus Branch service ended in May 1958, leaving through service on the Eastern Route as the only trains serving Lynn. Around this time, the third and fourth tracks through the station were removed due to reduced traffic, leaving the station with effectively two side platforms serving two tracks. =MBTA era= An MBTA train at the modern station By the late 1980s, the nearly-40-year-old station and the older platforms were crumbling. Since the Newburyport/Rockport line was no longer a freight clearance route past the General Electric plant in West Lynn, a full-length high-level platform was built to replace the 1952 platforms. The wide platform occupies the width of one former island platform plus one track slot, with the line's two current tracks on each side. The -long platform is located west of the older low platforms, which are still extant on the viaduct. A 1,000-space parking garage with a drop-off lane was built off Market Street; buses continued to use the former busway on Mount Vernon Street at Central Square. Entrances to the platform are available from the garage and from Central Square. The $50 million facility opened on January 21, 1992. The station was constructed with two elevators and an escalator to platform level. The escalator was no longer functional by 1995; it was later walled off along with one elevator. Along with the pair at Framingham, the remaining elevator is one of the few on the commuter rail system maintained by the MBTA, rather than by Amtrak or local agencies. In 2003, the MBTA spent slightly less than $100,000 to rehabilitate the deteriorated garage and to convert the drop-off lane into a full busway with shelters, benches, and signage. The busway opened on September 9, 2003 and 21 MBTA bus routes were rerouted from Central Square. In late 2005, the MBTA spent $168,000 for repairs to the garage roof, which frequently leaked during rain. The 1992 station was built with new concrete ties supporting the tracks connecting to the station, which proved less durable than expected. In September 2008, the MBTA board authorized a $1 million tie replacement and slope stabilization project at the station. In 2015, the Lynn garage had the lowest utilization rate of MBTA garages, partially due to safety concerns and partially because it was built to support future Blue Line demand. In 2011, 20 security cameras were added to the station as a reaction to several assaults in the garage. In August 2016, the MBTA began a $6.1 million improvement project at the station. The work includes drainage improvements, sidewalk and cobblestone replacement, stair and elevator repairs, painting of the garage structure to prevent rust, structural repairs to the garage, expansion joint replacement, and platform repairs. It was expected to be completed by November 2016. , the MBTA is planning a $60+ million renovation project that will include elevator and platform replacement. Lynn and River Works stations were changed from fare Zone 2 to Zone 1A (allowing subway-fare rides to Boston) from May 22‚Äì31 and July 1‚ÄìDecember 31, 2020 to provide additional travel options during the COVID-19 pandemic (as many of the 400-series bus routes were reduced in frequency) and to examine the impact of temporary fare changes. =Future= Space between the commuter rail embankment and the garage for the proposed Blue Line platform Lynn is intended to be the terminus of a future extension of the MBTA Blue Line, which would bring the line 4.5 additional miles from Wonderland in Revere to Lynn. This extension has been proposed in various forms for over 90 years. The 1926 Report on Improved Transportation Facilities and 1945‚Äì47 Coolidge Commission Report recommended that the East Boston Tunnel line, which had been converted to rapid transit from streetcars in 1924, be extended to Lynn via the Boston, Revere Beach & Lynn right-of-way. Ever since the 1954 Revere extension was cut short to Wonderland, a further extension to Lynn has been planned. Following on the 1926 and 1945-47 studies, the 1966 Program for Mass Transportation recommended that the Blue Line be extended to Lynn, while the 1969 Recommended Highway and Transit Plan proposed that the extension run as far as Salem. An extension was not present in the 1972 Final Report of the Boston Transportation Planning Review, but the 1974 Transportation Plan revived the project with possible termini of Lynn, Salem, or even Route 128 in Peabody. The 1978 Program for Mass Transportation report and 1983 Transportation Plan both continued support for an extension to Lynn. Despite the continued recommendations, however, other projects like extensions of the Red and Orange lines were given funding instead of the Blue Line. Despite numerous studies on the project and previous bond bills, there is currently no identified funding source; due to the MBTA's constrained finances, construction is not likely to begin soon. The 1992-built Lynn parking garage, designed for the capacity needed for the Blue Line extension, does not fill fully from commuter rail ridership. =Other Lynn stations= Map showing past and present stations in Lynn Lynn has also been home to eight other stations on different sites ‚Äì none of which lasted into the MBTA era ‚Äì plus a ninth that opened in 1965. Besides its downtown stops, the Eastern Railroad also served East Lynn from 1880 until Marblehead Branch service ended in June 1959. Stairways from the Chatham Street to the station site still exist, although no station building remains. The 1896 depot was disassembled in 1912 in preparation for the downtown grade separation. It was moved to Durham, New Hampshire, where it now serves as the University of New Hampshire Dairy Bar and a station stop on Amtrak's Downeaster service. A West Lynn station was located at Commercial Street at the junction with the Saugus Branch Railroad, and Green Street was briefly located just east of Central Square. Neither the West Lynn nor Green Street buildings survive. The Boston, Revere Beach & Lynn also served its own Lynn depot (a block away from the Eastern Railroad station) at Market Street near Broad Street, as well its own West Lynn station adjacent to the Eastern Railroad station just east of Commercial Street. Neither station is still extant. Service on the Saugus Branch Railroad began from Boston to Lynn (via Malden) in 1853, serving Central Square and West Lynn plus three new stations in northwest Lynn. These included Lynn Common station at Western Avenue, Raddin's Station at Summer Street and Raddin Grove Avenue, and East Saugus at Lincoln Avenue on the Saugus/Lynn border. Passenger service on the branch ended in May 1958; the branch is now abandoned and being turned into a rail trail. None of the station buildings survive, though the surviving Cliftondale station in Saugus was identical to the East Saugus station. River Works station is located in West Lynn on the Newburyport/Rockport Line. Opened on September 9, 1965 as G.E. Works, it is for the sole use of GE Aviation employees. Swampscott station, located just outside Lynn in Swampscott, Massachusetts, also serves passengers from East Lynn. Bus connections Aerial view of downtown Lynn and Lynn station. MBTA buses use the busway located next the parking garage at left center. Lynn serves as a major hub and transfer point for MBTA bus routes serving the North Shore area. All routes pull into the station busway off Route 1A, though some also stop at Central Square at the station's Exchange Street entrance. *: Central Square, Lynn‚Äì *: Central Square, Lynn‚Äì *: Northgate Shopping Center‚ÄìCentral Square, Lynn *: Liberty Tree Mall‚ÄìCentral Square, Lynn via Peabody Square *: Liberty Tree Mall‚ÄìCentral Square, Lynn via Goodwin Circle *: Nahant‚ÄìWonderland station *: Marblehead‚ÄìWonderland Station via Paradise Road *: Marblehead‚ÄìWonderland station via Humphrey Street *: Salem Depot‚ÄìWonderland station *: Salem Depot‚ÄìCentral Square, Lynn ReferencesExternal links * MBTA ‚Äì Lynn * Lynn station on Google Maps Street View: Market Street entrance, Union Street entrance, Exchange Street entrance Category:MBTA Commuter Rail stations in Essex County, Massachusetts Category:Stations along Boston and Maine Railroad lines Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1838 ","title":"Lynn station"},{"id":"15127179","text":"Positive Coaching Alliance (PCA) is a national non-profit organization to create a positive, character-building youth sports environment.

He left behind nine recorded lyric poems, including five cansos, two partimens, and two sirventes. He also wrote one longer work, the Romans de mondana vida. Folquet's birth date can be known precisely because he tells us in his Romans, written in 1284, that he was forty years old at the time. Folquet's earliest datable work is a partimen with Guiraut Riquier, dated to between 1264 and 1270. He presents Guiraut with a tricky question: :Guirautz, don'ab beutat granda :tota sol'aiatz :en un lieg, e selh que.l platz :jatz n'en autre, ses demanda :que l'us a l'autre no fai, :et amo.s de cor verai: :si.l cavaliers se lev'a lieys jazer :o ilh ab lui, cal li deu mais plazer? Folquet, along with fellow troubadours Dalfinet and Cerver√≠ de Girona, was in Spain in 1269 in the entourage of infante Peter. They accompanied Peter to Toledo, where he treated with Alfonso X of Castile. On 26 April at Riello, near Cuenca, on the way, Folquet was charged with distributing pay to the three: three solidi each for himself and Dalfinet and one solidus for Cerver√≠. His meeting with Alfonso X inspired Folquet, already a staunch Ghibelline, to write a sirventes in support of Alfonso's claim to the Holy Roman Empire. Al bon rey q'es reys de pretz car was usually dated to 1269, but is more likely to have been written later, between February 1271, when Pope Gregory X arrived in Rome, and September 1273, when Rudolf of Habsburg was elected King of Germany, since the sirventes mentions a pope (there had been a vacancy since 1268) and does not mention Rudolf's claim to the Empire. The most probable date is August/September 1273. The sirventes defends the attempts of Alfonso to receive his crown, advocates for the freedom of Henry of Castile (the imprisoned by the Guelphs), and lends support to Aragones political ambitions in Italy. Like both his contemporaries Cerver√≠ de Girona and Paulet de Marselha, Folquet had nothing but praise for Peter, James his father, and the Aragonese. The metre of the sirventes is copied from the work by Sordello. Cerver√≠ in his copied the same metre, either from Sordello or Folquet. At some point during the ongoing Guelph-Ghibelline conflict Folquet travelled into Lombardy, where he heard firsthand of the popularity of Alfonso: {:Qu'entre.ls lombartz ausi contar :que l'alaman e.l bromanso :e.l roman, ses contrastar, :volon a lui la lectio :de l'Emperi; e Milan e Pavia, :Cremona et Ast e ginoes an gran :cor quel bon rey castellan recebran :a gran honor, si ven en Lombardia.  :When among the Lombards I heard :that the Germans and the Braban√ßons :and the Romans, without disagreement, :wish for his election :to the Empire; and Milan and Pavia, :Cremona and Asti and the Genoese have a great :desire the good Castilian king to receive :in grand honour, if he ever comes to Lombardy. } Folquet had returned to Lunel by 1274. There he entered into relations with Henry II of Rodez, who was the dedicatee of his Romans. Three religious cansos may also have been dedicated to him: , , and . Indeed, a count of Rodez appears in the tornadas of both his religious and his (two) courtly love songs. Scholarship is divided over whether the intended count was Hugh IV, indicating that the songs are a product of Folquet's youth, or Henry II, making them a product of his maturity.

The station signed on in 1953 carrying programming from all four TV networks of the time, ABC, CBS, NBC, and the DuMont Television Network.TV Guide, January 8‚Äì14, 1954 It shared office space with WEBC radio and transmitted from the former WEBC-FM tower on Duluth's Observation Hill.A Technological History of WEBC Radio, A Graduate Thesis submitted by Roger J. Johnson WFTV faced challenges from the beginning, being a UHF station in an era when most television sets only included VHF tuners; set manufacturers were not required to include UHF tuning until 1964. Most Northland residents needed a converter to watch WFTV, and the picture quality left much to be desired even with one. Additionally, the Duluth market is a very large market geographically, and UHF stations do not carry well across large areas. As a result, the station never thrived; only the revenue from its radio sister kept it afloat. In March 1954, VHF stations WDSM-TV and KDAL-TV - both co-owned with other radio stations in the market - signed on and took the NBC and CBS affiliations. This left WFTV with ABC and DuMont. Saddled with affiliations with the two weakest and smallest networks, as well as a weak signal, WFTV could not compete and left the air shortly thereafter. Duluth would be a two-station market until WDIO-TV signed on in 1966. The market would not get another major UHF station until 1999 when KQDS-TV upgraded and affiliated with the FOX network. The bottom portion of the tower used by WEBC-FM and WFTV still stands, and is used today for telecommunications.fybush.com Tower Site of the Week, February 17, 2006 http://www.fybush.com/sites/2006/site-060217.html Channel 38 was originally used for WDSE's digital signal, but went empty again in 2009 when WDSE moved digital operations to channel 8. The WFTV callsign was adopted by the ABC affiliate on Channel 9 in Orlando, Florida, which was previously WLOF, in 1963.

Hudson book Knights of Spain, Warriors of the Sun. Charles Melvin Hudson, Jr. (1932‚Äì2013) was an anthropologist, professor of anthropology and history at the University of Georgia. He was a leading scholar on the history and culture of Native Americans in the Southeastern United States, and also published a book mapping the expedition of Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto in the mid-16th century in the Southeast. Life Born in 1932, Hudson grew up on a farm in Owen County, Kentucky, and attended local schools. He served in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War. After the war, he used the G.I. Bill to attend the University of Kentucky, receiving a bachelor's degree in anthropology in 1958. He pursued graduate studies in anthropology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, earning an M.A. (1962) and a Ph.D. (1965). Upon earning his doctorate, he became a faculty member in the anthropology department at the University of Georgia. He served there for 35 years, until his 2000 retirement, as a professor of anthropology and history. In retirement, Hudson returned to Kentucky. He died there, at Frankfort on June 8, 2013.Obituary for Charles Hudson, Jr., http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/onlineathens/obituary.aspx?pid=165292224 Scholarly work Hudson published The Southeastern Indians (University of Tennessee Press, 1976), a comprehensive overview of the region's native peoples. He was perhaps best known for his extensive research of Hernando de Soto's 1539‚Äì1543 expedition across the Southeast. In 1984, Hudson and fellow researchers Marvin T. Smith and Chester DePratter mapped the route taken by de Soto's expedition by using written accounts of expedition members, and matching them with geographic features and the results of continuing excavations of archaeological evidence of Indian settlements. Hudson and his colleagues argued that the sites of these settlements formed a chain across the Southeast that marked the path that would have been taken by the expedition. His other works included Knights of Spain, Warriors of the Sun (University of Georgia Press, 1998), a detailed account of the de Soto expedition. A strong advocate of fostering close ties between the disciplines of anthropology and history, Hudson was one of the founders of the Southern Anthropological Society. He served as president of the organization in 1973‚Äì74. In 1993‚Äì94 he served as president of the American Society for Ethnohistory.Thomas Pluckhahn and Robbie Ethridge, eds., Light on the Path: The Anthropology and History of the Southeastern Indians (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2006), pp. 9‚Äì12.

She was taught by UCLA student Bessie Nyi. She encountered problems in her communication with the extras on the set however, as she found out they were actually speaking a south Chinese dialect. In the film, she impersonates Ginger Rogers (with a life-sized Fred Astaire doll fixed to her toes), Eddie Cantor, and Al Jolson singing ‚ÄúMammy‚Äù. In the first take, the elastic band of the dummy, which she named Tommy Wonder, snapped off her foot. In preparation for the Jolson imitation, she had to listen and watch Jolson, something she did not enjoy doing.Shirley Temple Black, \\"Child Star: An Autobiography\\" (New York: McGraw- Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 149-151. Production of the movie was held up for close to four weeks while first Alice Faye then Shirley Temple came down with the flu.Shirley Temple Black, \\"Child Star: An Autobiography\\" (New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 151. The dog in the film, a miniature Chinese Pekinese which was owned by the wife of a local photographer, was given to Temple and renamed Ching-Ching (after her character in the movie). Temple's mother worked out a trade in which Temple and her father would agree to pose for the photographer in exchange for the dog.Shirley Temple Black, \\"Child Star: An Autobiography\\" (New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 158. Temple‚Äôs IQ was tested during the Stowaway period and found to be 155, the genius classification. Music The film features three songs by Harry Revel and Mack Gordon: \\"Goodnight, My Love\\" (sung by Temple, reprised by Faye), \\"One Never Knows, Does One?\\" (Faye), and \\"You Gotta S-M-I-L-E To Be H-A-Double-P-Y\\" (Temple), which later appeared in the opening credits for the 1970 film Gore Vidal's Myra Breckinridge. Other songs are \\"Please\\" by Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin (sung by a Chinese performer in a theater), and the film's finale, \\"That's What I Want for Christmas\\" by Gerald Marks and Irving Caesar (sung by Temple). Critical reception Variety remarked, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a nifty Shirley Temple comedy with musical trimmings.‚Äù Variety commented, ‚ÄúWhether or not due to Seiter‚Äôs efforts, [Shirley] does not appear to have outgrown [‚Ä¶] the Little Miss Marker stage in this one as she had in her last pictures‚Äù. The New York Times applauded the film, noting that Temple had ‚Äúan amusing script behind her, an agreeable adult troupe with her, and a clever director before her.‚Äù The reviewer thought the film the best from Temple since Little Miss Marker.

It was designed mostly as a research and teaching vehicle. The basic view of programming exhibited by Escher and related languages is that a program is a representation of a theory in some logic framework, and the program's execution (computation) is a deduction from the theory. The logic framework for Escher is Alonzo Church's simple theory of types. Escher, notably, supports I/O through a monadic type representing the 'outside world', in the style of Haskell. One of the goals of Escher's designers was to support meta- programming, and so the language has comprehensive support for generating and transforming programs. Examples MODULE Lambda.

In 1955 he played on the only Great Britain team to win the Bermuda Bowl (the world championship) and he won more European Bridge League open championships than any other British player. Konstam, educated at Oundle School, was employed for a time as a stockbroker in the London Stock Exchange. He was for many years an executive of the De La Rue company, which made playing cards, postage stamps and banknotes (the playing card business was eventually sold to Waddingtons). He served in the British Army during World War II, reaching the rank of Major. His fluent French qualified him to act as Liaison Officer to the French Army after D-Day.Ramsey, Guy. 1955. Aces All. Museum Press, London. p. 65 et seq.  Bridge career  Konstam was a key member of the London-based Great Britain bridge team which won the Bermuda Bowl in 1955, the first occasion a European team had beaten the United States in this competition, and the only victory for a British team in this, the world championship for teams of four. His main partner in the event was Leslie Dodds. Konstam was described by Ramsey that year as \\"about the best pragmatic player in the game today\\". His bidding and play was rapid and direct in style; he was known for bidding borderline games, and for his acute tactical awareness at the table. Konstam also represented Great Britain in the World Championship 1937; the Bermuda Bowl 1950, 1962, 1965; the World Olympiad 1964; and the European Championship 12 times (a record), winning in 1948, 1949, 1950, 1954, 1961, 1963 (the first six of Britain's seven wins). He won the Gold Cup five times: 1949, 1956, 1960, 1964 and 1965.The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge.

He was one of the proponents of a bidding system known as CAB, in which the responder to a strong artificial 2C opening immediately identifies an Ace in hand, if any. The 'B' stood for Blackwood; otherwise, the system was mostly natural, with strong no-trump opening bids, and forcing jump raises as in the older version of Standard American. He was bridge editor for the Sunday Times for many years. Konstam also played rubber bridge, which for many years was a good source of income. He had one attribute not given to all experts, namely, a great ability to partner weaker players. Many clients were surprised and delighted to find themselves winning a tournament where they would normally be back-markers. = Schapiro's opinion = In an article written in 1951 Boris Schapiro said of Konstam: :\\"Superb dummy player and defender, erratic and undisciplined bidder; is liable to and does in fact 'bring in' a lot of points.

He was a longtime resident of Fingest in Buckinghamshire and, latterly, Paris. Musical career Stone was a few years younger than his later musical partner Michael Moorcock but grew up in the same part of South London, knew the same book- and music-shops and had the same enthusiasms. The first time both met was on stage when Stone was in Mighty Baby and Moorcock was with Hawkwind. His last album, which he called his legacy album is LIVE FROM THE TERMINAL CAFE with Michael Moorcock and the Deep Fix (Cleopatra Records, Autumn 2019). Educated at Whitgift School, he initially wanted to be a journalist and began as a cub reporter on The Croydon Advertiser, interviewing Jimmy Page when he was still a session musician. Stone's passion for the guitar led him to become a musician. He was given consideration as a possible replacement for Brian Jones in the Rolling Stones. Stone played in many groups, including Junior's Blues Band, Stone's Masonry, Almost Presley, The Action, Savoy Brown Blues Band, Mighty Baby, Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers, Les Soucoupes violentes, Southern Comfort, Pink Fairies, The 101ers, Wreckless Eric, and the Gibson Girls. Martin also played live with French chanteuse Anne Pigalle for a couple of years including Glastonbury in 2005 for a second time He continued to play, backing Marianne Faithfull in her live performances, lead guitar in the French band Almost Presley and others. Book runner By the 1980s, Stone was earning much of his living as a bookseller, with an almost uncanny knack for finding 'lost' or famous books. He was a great fan of the writer M. P. Shiel, who first inspired his passion for book collecting and later book-selling, achieving an international reputation as a bookrunner. His personal collection of 19th-20th century French poetry was acquired in 2019 by Cambridge University Library. He was a major player in John Baxter's memoir A Pound of Paper: Confessions of a Book Addict. He was the subject of a limited edition photographic book Martin Stone, Bookscout by the California rare bookseller Peter Howard of Serendipity Books. He appeared in the television documentary Without Walls: The Cardinal And The Corpse (Iain Sinclair / Chris Petit 1992).

The Local Court is the lowest court in the court hierarchy in New South Wales, Australia. The Court deals with the majority of civil and criminal disputes in the State. The role of industrial magistrate allows certain magistrates to deal exclusively with and specialise in certain types of industrial matters in New South Wales including matters covered by both New South Wales and Commonwealth legislation. Magistrates have been a part of the New South Wales industrial system since the early days of the British colony established in 1788. The first officially appointed Chief Industrial Magistrate was appointed in 1912. Chief Industrial Magistrates have continued to be appointed since that year, and currently, the industrial work of the court is carried out principally by that magistrate, although other magistrates are appointed as Industrial Magistrates on a needs basis. History The role of the justice of the peace regulating the master and servant relation has been a long-standing one in the English common law tradition. This role was carried over into the administration of justice from the early days of the penal settlement established by the British in Port Jackson (now Sydney) in the colony of New South Wales. Employment in the 1900s was regulated using the common law concepts of contract. These concepts provided that an employer and employee were free to bargain as to the nature and the terms of employment. Where either party breached the contract, there was recourse to the law in the normal courts of the land. In certain situations, it was possible under various ‚ÄúMaster and Servant Acts‚Äù for employees or employers who broke employment contracts to be prosecuted for a breach of the criminal law. More commonly, this was directed at employees, particularly as wealthier employers would also be the local justice of the peace for the locality. Dr Geoffrey Partington outlines an example in 1858 where German masons who were brought to Australia to work on the Victorian railways. The employees broke their contracts after being persuaded to work for another employer. This was due to a shortage in the supply of experienced masons in Australia. The masons were imprisoned as a result of their breach of contract. The growing maturity of the New South Wales colony led to the employment of permanent paid magistrates. These magistrates were first employed in Sydney Town. However, they gradually replaced all local justices of the peace. Magistrates would in time come to be appointed specially to either being a stipendiary magistrate, children's magistrate, or an industrial magistrate. Industrial magistrates appear to have been first used in New South Wales around 1912. Their authority came from the then Industrial Relations Act 1912 (NSW). A Chief Industrial Magistrate was also appointed, although there was no statutory basis for doing so. The first statutorily appointed one was not until 1986.Halsbury's Laws of Australia [at paragraph IRA 381.10] Up until 1991, all magistrates were also gazetted as industrial magistrates. The process of gazetting is simply to give a magistrate a dual role or appointment. From 1991, magistrates were automatically appointed as an industrial magistrate under the Industrial Relations Act 1991. In practice, however, all work of an industrial nature was performed by the Chief Industrial Magistrate. In 1996, a new Industrial Act was passed. Under this law, magistrates are now only appointed on a needs basis to assist the Chief Industrial Magistrate in his or her duties.Halsbury's Laws of Australia [at paragraph IRA 381.10] Jurisdiction The chief industrial magistrate is appointed by the Governor of New South Wales under section 381 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996. The Governor may also appoint other magistrates to be industrial magistrates under section 381. The person must already hold an appointment of a magistrate in the Local Court of New South Wales before being appointed. The person loses the appointment of chief industrial magistrate or industrial magistrate once they cease to be a magistrate. Holding an appointment as the Chief Industrial Magistrate or as an Industrial Magistrate does not prevent that person from dealing with normal cases in the Local Court, and the person may sit as a coroner or as a children's magistrate if they hold such an appointment. When considering industrial cases, the industrial magistrate actually constitutes a Local Court rather than a specialised industrial court. Industrial magistrates have both criminal and civil jurisdictions. All the usual laws apply to proceedings in the court. However, in civil proceedings, the procedure of the court is regulated by the Industrial Relations Act rather than the Civil Procedure Act 2005. Certain types of cases may only be dealt with by industrial magistrates. These are cases under the following laws:   * *Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 *Shops and Industries Act 1962 * * Other laws, including federal laws, may empower an Industrial Magistrate to deal with cases. For example, the Australian Government gave power to Industrial Magistrates to deal with matters under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) through the now repealed section 177A.Halsbury's Laws of Australia [at paragraph IRA 381.10] Generally, criminal proceedings are restricted to breaches of safety regulations (for example under the Occupational Health and Safety Act). Civil proceedings are generally restricted to the recovery of unpaid wages or leave by employees against employers. Where the court makes an order in this type of case, the amount of money awarded must be registered and enforced in the Local Court rather than through an Industrial Court. Appeals Appeals from criminal decisions of the court are dealt with in the same manner as appeals from criminal decisions of the Local Court. However, unlike normal criminal cases, appeals go to the Industrial Court of New South Wales rather than the Supreme Court of New South Wales or the District Court of New South Wales. In civil matters, there is a right of appeal to the Industrial Court as well. This is a full right of appeal unlike the usual civil proceedings appeals which are limited to a point of law. Prominent cases In 1955, the then Chief Industrial Magistrate, Harry Isles, dealt with a claim by Frank Lambeth, a waiter sacked by prominent Sydney identify and businessman Abe Saffron. Lambeth had been employed at a restaurant run by a company owned by Saffron. Lambeth was sacked after giving evidence against the company supporting a claim that it had not paid a certain debt. Lambeth succeeded before the Chief Industrial Magistrate and was awarded 240 pounds. In 2001, the court dealt with the first ever Australian case in which a bank had been prosecuted for failing to make its premises safe for employees from bank robberies. The case involved an armed-holdup at the Wellington branch of the bank on 24 August 1999. The Chief Magistrate, George Miller, found that the bank had failed to conduct a risk assessment of the bank branch following union concerns about its safety. A fine of $25,000 was imposed following the bank's guilty plea and the bank had learned from the incident. In 2002 the court heard a case in which an employee fell off a stage prop he was constructing for the Italian Opera Rinalda at the Sydney Opera House. The employee fell off the mountain prop he was constructing. Following the incident, a crane and harness was obtained for future prop building. In 2004, the court heard a case of bullying and harassment in the workplace. It was alleged that a new employee underwent an initiation ceremony that involved the employee being wrapped in cling film from neck to ankle, strapped to a trolley and then spun around. The employee's mouth was then stuffed with sawdust and glue and then finally he was sprayed in the face with a firehose. The company concerned was fined $15,000 for the incident.

Walker, more familiarly known as John Walker, is an American concert organist, choirmaster, and CD recording artist. He is also a former president of the American Guild of Organists, elected in May 2014 to a two-year term of the 16,000-member organization. Walker has performed throughout the United States, Canada, Asia, and Europe. He is \\"widely recognized for his flawless technique and execution as well as his controlled and passionate playing,\\" said Duke University in announcing a John Walker recital at Duke Chapel. Since 2006 he has served on the faculty of the Peabody Institute and George Mason University. Early years and education Walker, the son of a Presbyterian minister, was born November 19, 1941 in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. As a child growing up in Spring Run, Franklin County, Pennsylvania and later Fredonia, Pennsylvania, he said that he \\"always wished that I could be the church organist.\\" He began fulfilling his wish while a high school freshman in Spring Run, playing as a substitute church organist at his father's church when the regular organist became ill for a month. He studied at Westminster College, Pennsylvania and at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago where he earned two Master of Music degrees cum laude: organ and church music in 1965 and music theory in 1969. Walker then earned a Doctor of Musical Arts degree from Stanford University in 1972. His teachers, Raymond Ocock and Robert Lodine, \\"molded and nurtured\\" his career, wrote Walker. Herbert Nanney, Professor of Music at Stanford, also had a dominant role in Walker's professional growth. Professional career Walker was professor of organ at San Jos√© State University, San Jose, California in the mid 1970s before becoming assistant organist at New York City's famed Riverside Church in 1979. He subsequently succeeded Frederick Swann as director of music and organist at Riverside Church (1983-1992). While in New York, Walker chaired the organ department of Manhattan School of Music. In 1992, he became minister of music and organist at Shadyside Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (1992-2004). From 2004 to December, 2011 he was minister of music and organist at Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church in Baltimore, Maryland. Upon retiring from Brown Memorial, Walker was given the title Minister of Music Emeritus in recognition of his distinguished service to the Baltimore church. In 2013, he became interim organist and choirmaster at Grace and St. Peter's Church (also in Baltimore), an Anglo-Catholic parish (Episcopal Church), conducting a professional choir of nine in a demanding program of choral masses, motets, and plainsong (September 2013 - June 2014). Music critics have praised Walker's organ concerts, a New York Times reviewer saying, after his recital of American organ music at Riverside Church, \\"His registrations were colorful and imaginative, his technical command impeccable.\\" A Kansas City Star review of Walker's performance at (RLDS) Auditorium there said, \\"Anyone harboring notions of organ recitals as dull, churchy affairs obviously hasn't heard John Walker...A high-profile musical personality was never in doubt, and there was virtuosity to burn.\\" In addition to solo organ appearances, Walker often has performed with notable orchestras such as the San Francisco Symphony conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas. He also accompanied the New York Philharmonic in a 1990 recording of Gustav Holst's The Planets. The organ divisions and chancel at Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church, where John Walker was minister of music and organist 2004-2011 Walker told a radio interviewer in 2006 that performing an organ recital for a large audience is a \\"great thrill,\\" but said he finds it \\"more fulfilling\\" to play the organ for worship services. Playing for a congregation \\"singing with its full heart and soul,\\" he said, \\"is moving beyond measure...through the way I interpret the texts in the hymns...It's a combination of being an organist, a composer, and a pastor.\\" He told one magazine interviewer, \\"Service players create something meaningful and artistic by providing leadership in the liturgy, as well as congregational participation in worship.\\" He wrote in 2010 of \\"the transcendence of sacred music\\" calling it \\"decidedly countercultural--in contrast with the popular media, which equates music with star personalities, sacred music seeks only to bring worthy worship to God.\\" The music of worship, said Walker, has \\"different and nobler criteria than music merely intended for the concert hall or television.\\" Since 2006, Walker has served as professor of organ performance at Baltimore's renowned Peabody Institute. Previously he was adjunct professor of organ and sacred music at Duquesne University (1997-2006), adjunct professor of music at Westminster College (1993-1998), and chairman of the organ department at Manhattan School of Music in New York City (1984-1992). Awards and honors Walker in 1968 became Fellow of the American Guild of Organists (AGO), the highest level of certification granted by the organization. He also sits on the AGO Board of Examiners. On June 25, 2008 he was elected to a two-year term as AGO vice-president (July 1, 2008 - June 30, 2010). He was reelected to a second two-year term in 2010 and again to a third term in July, 2012. In May 2014, he was elected president of the American Guild of Organists in a national election, installed in that position at the Guild's National Convention in Boston the last week of June, 2014.

In 1999 he received a Fulbright Fellowship grant for a lecture series at a college in Taiwan to teach organ repertoire and hymn improvisation, along with giving frequent organ recitals. Shortly before he was to begin this series, the devastating 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake hit Taiwan on September 21 which measured 7.6 on the MMS scale. Walker's performances became benefit concerts, instead helping to raise money for disaster relief between October, 1999 and February, 2000. A recital by Walker, originally intended to be part of the 50th anniversary celebration of Taiwan's current government, was transformed into a memorial service for the earthquake's victims. His recital at National Concert Hall in Taipei in March, 2013 marked his 14th concert journey to Taiwan. Discography John Walker has recorded for the Pro Organo, Gothic, and JAV labels.

Playing career Woodhouse was born in Warrington and played as a teenager for Monk's Hall in the Cheshire County League, before joining Bury in May 1921. At Bury he played at inside right making six appearances in each of the 1921‚Äì22 and 1922‚Äì23 seasons. In 1923‚Äì24 he made eleven appearances, contributing three goals as Bury gained second place in the Second Division table thus gaining promotion to the top flight. In a bid to strengthen the team for their return to the First Division, Bury signed Southampton's experienced left half Bill Turner with Woodhouse and John Callagher moving to the south coast as part of the deal. Woodhouse made his debut for Southampton on 30 August 1924 in the opening match of the season playing at inside left, before losing his place to Cliff Price after six games. He made a few spasmodic appearances at inside left, before switching to left half for a few matches near the end of the season. The following season he began to make the left half spot his own, lining up with either George Harkus or Bert Shelley on the right and Alec Campbell or Arthur Bradford in the centre. He soon established himself as \\"a half-back of some standing\\" and rarely missed a match over the next five seasons. In 1926‚Äì27 he only missed two league matches and appeared in all six FA Cup matches in Saints' run to the FA Cup Semi-final at Stamford Bridge on 26 March 1927, which Southampton lost 1‚Äì2 to Arsenal. During this season manager Arthur Chadwick settled on his favoured line-up with eleven players featuring in at least 35 of the 42 league games; Woodhouse lined up in midfield alongside Bert Shelley and George Harkus in front of full-backs Michael Keeping and Ted Hough. Woodhouse was \\"an unsung player (who) was nevertheless a vital cog in the team ‚Äì his probing passes were a special feature of his game\\". He continued to appear regularly although injury restricted his appearances in 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32. For the start of the 1932‚Äì33 season he switched across to the right, with Bill Luckett on the left (and Arthur Bradford in the centre) until February when Luckett was pushed forward and Alec Campbell came in on the right of the half-backs, with Woodhouse reverting to the left. He continued to feature regularly on either flank for the next few seasons until age and injury caught up with him and, like his long-serving partner Arthur Bradford, he retired at the end of the 1935‚Äì36 season. Woodhouse spent twelve seasons at The Dell, during which he made a total of 366 appearances (with 5 goals); all his league matches were in the Second Division in a period during which the Saints struggled financially and were generally forced to sell their better players to survive. At the time of his retirement, his total of 351 league appearances was only exceeded by Bert Shelley. Later career After retiring from professional football, Woodhouse had a brief spell with Basingstoke Town before returning to Southampton where he became the licensee of the Bricklayers Arms in Warren Avenue, Shirley. In 1951 he spent a few months as trainer to Southampton's youth teams. He died in Southampton on 18 March 1977, aged 78.

Miles Prosser has been the Executive Director of the Australian Aluminium Council since 2008.  Membership  Council members include some of Australia's largest companies, including Alcoa, Alumina Limited, Rio Tinto Aluminium, and Hydro Aluminium. Member companies of the Australian Aluminium Council produce 26 percent of global alumina sales and are collectively the fifth largest producer of aluminium. The Australian aluminium industry employs around 17,000 workers directly and generates export earnings worth over $8.3 billion.  Role of the Council  The Council is the peak industry association representing the Australian Aluminium industry. The Council promotes the use of Australian aluminium products nationally and internationally. A technical standards group within the Council also develops and maintains material specifications and technical data for industry use, and the Council produces an annual statistical analysis of materials consumption, aluminium production and exports by Australia's six aluminium smelters and one aluminum-rolled product plant. As an industry advocate, the Council has strongly opposed greenhouse gas emissions trading schemes on the basis that anti-emission technology is insufficient to minimise the cost impact on producers, and that international action on greenhouse gases should precede Australian programs. The Council also notes that while greenhouse gas emissions from Australian aluminium smelters rose 29 percent since 1990 to a peak of 13.9 million tonnes in 2006, this lags behind a 64 percent increase in aluminium production over the same period.

Initially allocated to work as an ambulance driver and ARP warden, he was petitioned against by those who objected to working with \\"conchies\\" (conscientious objectors) and was reassigned to farm work, highly problematic for an asthmatic. It was \\"no secret, however, that for a great deal of the war he was in London; and when he was in London, he was playing cards.\\" After the war, he spent months each year in the south of France where the dry climate helped his asthmatic lungs. Meredith was passionately artistic with interests in ballet and theatre. When the Ballet N√®gre (a creation of Katherine Dunham) came to London \\"and teetered between success and failure ... he backed it with hard-earned savings he had amassed at bridge\\". Terence Reese referred to Meredith as \\"even-tempered, a staunch friend in an undemonstrative way, and quite immovable when he took up a position about anything.\\" Meredith was semi- retired from tournament play in 1957 when he moved from London to New York.Francis (1984) p. 673 There, he formed a friendship with Ruth Sherman, a leading American player, who supported his bridge activities and who upon her death in 1965 bequeathed to him the income on the bulk of her $450,000 estate. According to an obituary bridge column by the English expatriate and expert, Alan Truscott, Meredith played rubber bridge but little tournament bridge in the US and \\"the last ten years of his life were sad ones, marred by progressive ill health\\". He died in New York City in January 1976. \\"in obscurity\\" when alcoholism further reduced his vitality and shortened his life.  Bridge career  Meredith was a bridge professional who played rubber bridge for a living and high-level competitive tournament duplicate. Meredith was a key member of the British team \\"doing as much as anyone to win the world championship match in 1955\\" ‚Äì the Bermuda Bowl. He won the European Championship in 1949 and 1954,Hasenson (2004) pp. 388‚Äì389.

Plum did not play the Baron system in the Bermuda Bowl victory. He was one of the four players who played CAB, the system favoured by Konstam, Dodds and Pavlides. Meredith was also quite au fait with Acol. His personal honesty extended to his bridge career. He created a precedent when he withdrew from a British team on the grounds that a pair from a continental team were cheats. Others also thought so but had nevertheless played.Mollo (1968) pp. 133‚Äì138 At bridge he liked to seize the initiative early in a match; some of his bidding manoeuvres (which often centred round the spade suit) became legendary. He was also a remarkable dummy player. Regarding his fondness for the spade suit, Victor Mollo wrote: \\"No man, no three men, for that matter, have bid spades so often or so devotedly as Plum.\\" Mollo also wrote that he \\"has been known to play brilliantly after despatching eleven glasses of green Chartreuse\\".Shireen Mohandes, Bridge, December 2015, \\"Adam 'Plum' Meredith, Madman or Genius\\", pages 26‚Äì27. He was once heard to say of an opponent: \\"She had an enormous bag full of knitting. How could I think she was going to psyche?\\" = Opinions by other players = In his 1945 book Why You Lose at Bridge, S. J. Simon rated Meredith as \\"one of the best money bridge players in the country [i.e. England]\\". In 1951, Boris Schapiro gave his opinion of Plum in a bridge magazine article: > At times rightly described as a genius, definitely the best player of > difficult hands in the country, very good bidder (when not indulging in some > particular idiocy), superb dummy player and defender.

It is a slender shrub with short, leafy side-branches and long flowering stems with rounded heads of mostly white flowers. Its hairy sepals are mostly hidden by the round, unfringed petals, and as a result, the plant looks like shrubs in the genus Chamelaucium, to which it is closely related. Description Verticordia habrantha is a shrub which grows to high and wide and which has a few main stems with many short, leafy side-branches. The leaves on the side branches are linear to narrow elliptic in shape, roughly triangular in cross-section, long, while those on the flowering stems are elliptic to egg-shaped and up to long. The flowers are arranged in rounded or corymb-like groups near the ends of the long flowering stems, each flower on an erect stalk, long. The floral cup is about long and covered with short, soft hairs. The sepals are white, sometimes pale pink, spreading but curving upwards, long, with 8 to 12 hairy lobes and two ear-shaped, hairy appendages on the sides. The petals are the same colour as the sepals, egg-shaped to almost round, , spreading with a smooth edge and are joined with the ring of stamens and staminodes, to form a short tube. The style is less than long, straight and glabrous. Flowering time is from September to December.V. habrantha with other species, in a painting by Ellis Rowan The genus Verticordia is closely related to waxflowers of Chamelaucium and this verticordia superficially resembles a waxflower because the \\"feathery\\" sepals are hidden by the smooth-edged petals. Taxonomy and naming The first formal description of this species was published by Johannes Conrad Schauer in Lehmann's 1844 Plantae Preissianae, from a specimen collected by Ludwig Preiss near the Gordon River. The specific epithet (habrantha) is a derived from the Greek words habros meaning \\"dainty\\" or \\"pretty\\" and anthos meaning \\"a flower\\". When Alex George reviewed the genus in 1991, he placed this species in subgenus Verticordia, section Catocalypta along with V. roei, V. inclusa, V. apecta, V. insignis, V. lehmannii and V. pritzelii. Distribution and habitat This verticordia usually grows in sandy soils, with, or over loam, clay or gravel, sometimes in gravelly soil derived from granite, sometimes on spongolite. It often grows in areas that are inundated in winter and with other species of Verticordia in heath, shrubland or woodland. It is found from the Busselton area east to the Hamersley River and north to Kulin and the Arthur River in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren biogeographic regions. Conservation Verticordia habrantha is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Although this species is attractive with its fleshy foliage and waxy-looking flowers, it has been difficult to establish in gardens. Some forms appear to be easier than others and have been hardy in both summer- and winter-rainfall areas. Propagation has been from cuttings but these have been difficult to grow on.

World War II and Cold War ships HMAS Westralia in 1944 The Australian military's first amphibious warfare ships were the three Landing Ships Infantry (LSI): HMAS Kanimbla, HMAS Manoora, and HMAS Westralia. These three ships had been built as civilian motor vessels and were converted to armed merchant cruisers at the outbreak of war in 1939. They were converted again to LSIs in 1943 and took part in United States and Australian amphibious assaults in the South West Pacific Area.Seapower Centre ‚Äì Australia (2005). Page 97. The ships had a capacity of about 1,200 troops, which were landed from boats carried by the LSIs. Following the war, the three LSIs remained in service as transports until 1949 when they were returned to their owners. The RAN borrowed six Landing Ships Tank (LSTs) from the Royal Navy between 1946 and 1955. The LSTs were used as general purpose vessels and did not specialise in amphibious operations. After the LSTs were disposed of Australia was left without any amphibious warfare ships. To rectify this situation the Army purchased four LSM-1 class Landing Ship Medium from the United States Navy in 1959. These ships were operated by the 32nd Small Ship Squadron, Royal Australian Engineers and supported Army exercises and operations. All four of the ships saw active service during the Vietnam War where they carried supplies between Australia and South Vietnam and between South Vietnamese ports.

The first ship in the class, HMAS Balikpapan was briefly operated by the Army's Water Transport force but was later transferred to the Navy and all subsequent ships in the class were transferred to the Navy while they were under construction.Seapower Centre ‚Äì Australia (2005). Page 98. Two ships, HMAS Buna and HMAS Salamaua, were transferred to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force in 1974. Three of the remaining craft have or will be decommissioned in December 2012, with the remainder to leave service during 2014. These ships have proven to be very successful and have supported Australian Army exercises and operations throughout South East Asia. The Australian Defence Force's (ADF's) amphibious warfare capabilities were significantly expanded in 1982 when the landing ship heavy HMAS Tobruk was commissioned. This ship was the first amphibious vessel purpose built for the RAN and was based on the British Round Table class landing ship logistics design. She has supported ADF operations around the world. The ADF's amphibious warfare capabilities were further expanded in 1994 when two Newport class tank landing ships were purchased from the USN. These ships were greatly modified and finally entered service in the late 1990s as the Kanimbla class landing platform amphibious. They have supported ADF operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Solomon Islands and East Timor.Seapower Centre ‚Äì Australia (2007). Page 1. In addition to the seagoing ships, the RAN and Army also currently operate a number of smaller amphibious craft which are carried by Tobruk and the Kanimbla class ships. The RAN has four Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel (LCVP) which can carry a Land Rover sized vehicle or 36 personnel. The Army operates a small fleet of LCM-8 mechanised landing craft and LARC-V amphibious cargo vehicles.Seapower Centre ‚Äì Australia (2005). Page 104. Future ships HMAS Tobruk and one of the LPAs will be replaced by two Canberra class LHDs between 2012 and 2014. These ships will be the largest warships ever operated by the Royal Australian Navy, and will each be able to carry an infantry battalion and up to 24 Army and Navy helicopters.Gillis (2007). Page 28. It is planned to replace the other LPA with a sealift ship.Borgu (2004). Page 2, 6. Both LPAs were taken out of service in September 2010 due to concerns about their seaworthiness. On 1 February 2011 the Minister for Defence announced that repairing Manoora would not be cost effective given that the ship was scheduled to retired at the end of 2012 and that she would instead be decommissioned. He also stated that Kanimbla would be repaired but was not expected to return to operational service until mid-2012. In December 2010 a team from the RAN traveled to Britain to inspect the Bay class landing ship dock RFA Largs Bay, which was scheduled to be placed in reserve in April 2011, and Australian Defence Minister Stephen Smith stated in January 2011 that Australia was considering purchasing the ship. On 6 April 2011 Smith announced that Australia would buy Largs Bay and that the ship was expected to enter service with the RAN in 2012. In May 2011 the Australian Government chartered the civilian icebreaker Aurora Australis for two months to provide an amphibious capability while Tobruk was undergoing maintenance. In December 2011 the government announced that it would purchase a commercial vessel to provide the RAN with a third ship for humanitarian and disaster relief tasks alongside Choules and Tobruk. A project is also underway to replace the LCHs and the Army and Navy's small amphibious craft. These new craft will be capable of operating from the well decks in the Canberra class ships.

The unit is based in Camp Narashino in Funabashi, Chiba along with the 1st Airborne Brigade. The unit was formerly known as the Special Operations Group. The SFGp has been referred to as Japan's Delta Force, due to their specialized role in the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force. Personnel from the Delta Force of the U.S. Army had been responsible for assisting the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force in raising the SFGp's foundations prior to its establishment. The civilian counterpart of the SFGp are the police Special Assault Teams. History In 1998, the Defense Agency had proposed the formation of a unit within the JGSDF that would handle tasks such as counter-terrorism with a selected group of JGSDF soldiers from the 1st Airborne Brigade sent to the United States to be trained by Delta Force operators.https://medium.com/war-is-boring/japan-doesn-t-need-a-hostage- rescue-force-fe2f78649d68 At the same time, two platoons were created from the brigade to be the foundations for the new unit. These consisted of the G Platoon (Formation Unit) and the S Platoon (Research Unit). The establishment of the unit's framework had been completed in 2003, after 3 years of training and organisation. The unit's structure is based on that of Delta Force and Green Berets of the United States Army. On March 27, 2004, the Defense Agency activated the unit as the Special Operations Group with the mandate under the JGSDF as its counter-terrorist unit. In 2005, the SFGp had deployed four of its operators to serve as bodyguards for the commander of the JGSDF's contingent in Iraq under the Japanese Iraq Reconstruction and Support Group. On March 28, 2007, the SFGp, along with the 1st Airborne Brigade, the 1st Helicopter Brigade, and the 101st NBC Protection Unit, became part of the newly created Central Readiness Force. The unit changed its English name on March 26, 2008 from SOG to SFGp or the Special Forces Group. On January 18, 2018, the SFGp conducted one of their few exercises before the presence of the Australian and Japanese prime ministers.https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/special-operations/japan- highlights-sof-capabilities/ Formation JGSDF SFGp commandos standing at attention during a 2007 ceremony. * Commander (Led by a Colonel) * Executive Officers (Led by a Lieutenant Colonel) * Headquarters ** 1st Department (General Affairs) ** 2nd Department (Intelligence) ** 3rd Department (Planning) ** 4th Department (Supply) * Headquarters Administration Unit (Led by 3 Majors) * 1st SFGp Company ** Company Headquarters ** 1st Platoon (HALO) *** Specialized squads (e.g. Assault, Sniper) ** 2nd Platoon (Naval warfare) ** 3rd Platoon (Mountain warfare) ** 4th Platoon (Urban warfare) * 2nd SFGp Company * 3rd SFGp Company * Training Unit Training Potential recruits to the SFGp are drawn from Ranger-qualified personnel of the 1st Airborne Brigade.

It traverses the state after entering from California in Topaz Lake and crosses back into California near Hallelujah Junction. US 395 serves the cities of Gardnerville, Minden, Carson City and Reno. All of US 395 north of Carson City is a freeway and is built up to Interstate Highway standards. Part of the freeway section is also designated as Interstate 580 (I-580). US 395 is an important regional highway, serving the communities of Western Nevada, connecting them to other major communities via California, and it is the only major north‚Äìsouth arterial for the geographically isolated region. Route description Southbound US 395 in Douglas County, about south of the I-580/US 50 intersection in Carson City US 395 enters Nevada in Topaz Lake as a two-lane highway and gradually winds its way to Carson Valley where it becomes the principal thoroughfare for the Gardnerville‚ÄìMinden area. Upon entering the Carson Valley, US 395 becomes a four-lane highway through Gardnerville and Minden. Upon leaving Minden, the highway becomes a four-lane divided highway and turns due north towards Carson City. At the south end of Carson City, the route intersects the southern terminus of I-580 and US 50\\\\. The three routes then continue on a freeway bypass around the east side of Carson City. US 50 departs from the freeway at East William Street, while I-580 and US 395 continue north through Carson City. View north along US 395 in Reno, just north of I-80 Upon exiting Carson City, the freeway continues north through Washoe Valley and crosses through the mountains west of Washoe City and Pleasant Valley before entering Reno. Upon entering Reno, the route is designated, since 1998, as the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway. The freeway heads north to the I-80 interchange near Downtown Reno and I-580 ends here. Shortly afterward, US 395 turns northwest to serve the northern valleys of the Reno area before crossing back to California at the unincorporated Nevada community of Bordertown, in Cold Springs, Washoe County. The entire route of US 395 through Nevada closely follows the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada range. Several prominent peaks are visible from the highway, including Jobs Peak and Mount Rose. History Per Nevada Historical Marker number 124, located along the route near Minden, this portion of US 395 was originally built as a toll road called Boyd's Toll Road. The original state route designations for modern US 395 was SR 9 north of Reno, SR 3 Reno to Holbrook (at the modern junction of US 395 and SR 208) and SR 19 from there to the state line at Topaz Lake. The US 395 designation was added to the route by 1937. From the inception of the Interstate Highway system there were plans to upgrade the portion from Carson City to Reno to Interstate Highway standards, and while portions were improved, rerouted and rebuilt to a new freeway alignment starting in the 1960s, the road was not officially signed as Interstate 580 until 2012. There were plans to extend the US 395 freeway from US 50 and the southern terminus of I-580 to SR 757 and Muller Lane. The given name would be called the Carson Valley Freeway. The routing for I-580 and US 395 had been considered as a potential alignment for the extension of I-11 from US 95 north of Walker Lake to I-80 at the Spaghetti Bowl interchange in Reno.

In 1953 with Tuƒçkus in goal Spartak earned a promotion to Soviet Top League. In 1954 Tuƒçkus joined one of the strongest teams in Soviet football - Spartak Moscow and in the first season with Spartak won silver medals. The same result (with Tuƒçkus playing approximately half of matches) was repeated in 1955. In 1956 Spartak and Tuƒçkus won Soviet gold, in that season Tuƒçkus was the undisputed number one goalkeeper in Spartak (he played in 20 matches out of total 22), he was also a candidate for the USSR national football team. 1957 was his last season with Spartak - he played in only 10 matches and Spartak finished third in the championship.Tuƒçkus' statistics in Soviet leagues Because of problems with discipline off the field Tuƒçkus' career seemed finished and by 1960 he was living in Brocƒìni, Latvia without a job and a perspective. But then he was offered to return to football and to play for FK Daugava Rƒ´ga which in 1960 because of a decision from above had got a place in the Soviet top league. Tuƒçkus returned to training and soon proved that he still was a very good goalkeeper and it was largely his contribution that allowed Daugava to finish in the middle of the table in 1960. However, because of problems with discipline Tuƒçkus had to leave Daugava in 1961. He continued playing on amateur level for Kompresors Rƒ´ga for some years.

The game featured contestants guessing the correct percentage range of answers to polls which have been taken from surveys, for a chance to win a million dollars. The Australian version of the show premiered on Monday, 31 March 2008 at 7:30 pm on the Nine Network and was recorded in Melbourne's GTV-9 studios. The show was hosted by Today weatherman Steven Jacobs. This version followed the basic rules of the American version of the show, except with different safe levels, which are $100, $1000, $10,000, $100,000 and $1,000,000. There was no ten million-dollar question as in the U.S. version. Despite eight episodes being filmed and six episodes never being screened, the network revealed that the game show was \\"indefinitely shelved\\" on 8 April 2008 after the second episode only pulled 200 people across all five main capital cities, losing the whole Monday Night to Channel Seven.New game show axed after two weeks  NEWS.com.au Format Each game consisted of two rounds. The first round featured two contestants, who tried to guess the percentages of people that said \\"yes\\" to one of various questions in a national poll. The person who guessed closest to the actual percentage earned a point. The first player to win three points in this round proceeded to the next, while the other player left the game with nothing. In the second round, the contestant had the chance to win one million Australian dollars. Contestants were asked five questions similar to those in Round One. In the first four questions, the contestants had to guess a percentage of people answering the survey which fell within a given range centered on the correct answer. The first question allowed a range of 40 percentage points (from 20% below the correct answer to 20% above), the second 30 points (15% below to 15% above), and so on - the fourth question requiring the contestant to guess the correct percentage to within plus or minus 5%. The contestant would win a stake of money for the first question correctly answered; the stake would increase by a factor of ten for each subsequent correct answer. After any question, the contestant could elect to leave the game with his or her current winnings. An incorrect answer would end the game, the contestant leaving with the amount of money they had prior to their last correct answer. The contestant had to answer the fifth question correct to the exact percentage. For any question except the million dollar question, if a contestant guessed the actual percentage, they won an instant $1000. Notes * The very first contestant Kalia Best won $100.

Its past, rooted in 19th-century America and subsequent growth in the two centuries since then, have closely paralleled the nation's political and sociological trends. It was a congregation split asunder in 1861 on the eve of the American Civil War in a border state of divided loyalties, which eventually reunited and built a church in the post‚ÄìWorld War II era of the 1950s, a time of reconciliation and rapid growth by mainline Protestant denominations, especially in the more affluent suburbs. The 1,000-member church, pastored since July 2017 by Mark Johnson, has a number of community outreach programs, including an accredited child care center and a boy scout troop, and actively supports a home for unwed mothers, overseas missions, and Habitat for Humanity projects. The congregation worships in a 1,000-seat sanctuary built in 1958. The large building's prominent spire and cupola, a landmark visible for miles from the nearby Baltimore Beltway (Interstate 695), has been called \\"the beacon of Towson\\". Towson United Methodist Church is located on Hampton Lane at interchange #27B of the Baltimore Beltway and Dulaney Valley Road (Md. Route 146), one-half mile (one km) west of Hampton National Historic Site. The church's land was originally part of the vast 18th-century Hampton estate. History=The beginning; 1750s‚Äì1850s= First settled by brothers William and Thomas Towson in 1752, the hamlet now bearing their name remained mostly farmland until the 1830s, with no churches and little more than a roadside inn/tavern for travelers on York Road (now Md. Route 45). In the 1790s, Rebecca Dorsey Ridgely, the wife of Charles Ridgely III and described as an ardent Methodist, began holding prayer meetings at the Ridgelys' grandiose Hampton Mansion, located one-half mi (one km) east of the present church site. By 1825, the first Sunday School was started in a private home near a blacksmith's shop on York Road. In 1839, the citizenry of sparsely populated Towsontown, as the village was called by then, built the tiny community's first church in a wooded location north of Joppa Road and east of Dulaney Valley Road. The site was previously used for a powder magazine built by Gen. Nathan Towson prior to the British attack on Baltimore in September 1814, during the War of 1812. Called Epsom Chapel, the structure was built of stones salvaged from the arsenal. Led by Methodist Episcopal minister Daniel Helpler, Epsom Chapel was dedicated and opened for Towsontown's first public church service on Sunday, November 10, 1839. In line with Methodist practice of the time in rural areas, circuit rider ministers would travel on horseback to preach to the villagers at Epsom Chapel. With the designation of Towson as the county seat in 1854, the town began to grow more rapidly. The small chapel was shared with other denominations until the 1870s, when Towson's increasing population spurred the construction of larger churches. =Division and separate churches; 1860s‚Äì1950s= The congregation at Epsom Chapel in 1899 The Methodist movement was growing rapidly in pre-Civil War America, but was beset by disputes about slave-holding and the rule over the church by bishops, resulting in a formal split into two groups in 1844. The faction in favor of giving church authority to a hierarchy of bishops called themselves the Methodist Episcopal Church and took an anti-slavery stance in the north. Those in opposition formed the Methodist Protestant Church in the United States. As the impending Civil War loomed over the nation in the 1850s, local Towson Methodists continued to worship together at Epsom Chapel. This ended in 1861, when a reed organ was purchased for Epsom Chapel, sparking a disagreement over the use of musical instruments in worship. A minority opposed to the idea joined the southern-leaning Methodist Protestant Church, withdrawing from Epsom Chapel to worship at Towson's Odd Fellows Hall during the Civil War. In 1867, the Methodist Protestants returned to Epsom Chapel, but met separately on Sunday afternoons. Towson Methodist Episcopal Church (First Methodist Church) The northern-leaning Methodist Episcopal congregation, which continued worshiping at Epsom Chapel during the Civil War, began building their own church nearby, with the laying of a cornerstone on August 14, 1869. The Towson Methodist Episcopal (ME) Church, a neo-Gothic brick structure, was located on York Road next to the present Prospect Hill Cemetery, one block north of the intersection with Joppa and Dulaney Valley Roads. Designed by Edmund George Lind and built at a cost of $29,000, the 350-seat church was completed and dedicated on October 26, 1871. Towson Methodist Episcopal Church, built in 1871 The ME Church's eighty-seven members soon found themselves in financial difficulties, however, having gone heavily in debt to build their new sanctuary. The chairman of the church's building committee had advanced his personal funds to complete the construction, thereafter becoming embroiled in years of litigation with the church. By 1874, the church was drawing larger crowds under then-pastor Joseph Stitt, who was described as an \\"excellent leader of singing\\". An afternoon Sunday school session was particularly popular, \\"principally devoted to learning new hymns, which attracted many of the young people of the town, especially the young men\\", noted one account. When the ME church held its twenty-fifth anniversary celebration in 1896, it opened with prayer and a piano concert, \\"favored with a beautiful selection sung by Mrs. Randolph Murphy\\", said a contemporary report. Although the two Methodist congregations had remained estranged since the split in 1861, both groups did come together in 1895 for a \\"Great Revival\\" in Towson. The joint services were attended by throngs and the \\"preaching was with power\\", newspapers commented. At the beginning of the 20th century, the increasingly large and prosperous congregation added eleven stained glass windows to the ME church, including Christ the Good Shepherd by Heinrich Hofmann. In 1921, a new pipe organ was installed by M. P. M√∂ller. Towson Methodist Protestant Church (Second Methodist Church) Towson Methodist Protestant Church in the 1920s The Methodist Protestant group continued to use Epsom Chapel until 1908, when they built a $6,000 church seating 150 persons at the corner of Allegheny and Bosley Avenues. Located in the heart of Towson near the County Circuit Courthouse, the Towson Methodist Protestant Church was constructed of stone with a slate roof and a bell tower. With the merger in 1939 of the Methodist Episcopal (ME) and Methodist Protestant (MP) denominations in the US, Towson's Methodist Episcopal and Methodist Protestant churches were known thereafter as First Methodist Church and Second Methodist Church, respectively. =The reunited church; 1950s-present= Following the reunification of the two branches of Methodism in 1939, First Methodist Church and Second Methodist Church of Towson continued as separate entities for another thirteen years. After the end of World War II in 1945, mainline Protestant church attendance increased significantly in the US. By early 1952, faced with facilities fast becoming inadequate for the burgeoning population of suburbia in the postwar period and with a boom in modern commercial development of Towson's core area starting to displace older buildings, the two churches formed a joint committee to evaluate a merger. The committee recommended that the two churches become one, concluding: In April 1952, more than ninety years after the two churches split, the congregations of both finally voted to reunite, merging on and adopting the name Towson Methodist Church. The members of both Methodist churches then began worshiping together at the First Methodist Church.High Spire, Towson United Methodist Church, January, 2008. Plans to construct a much larger building with ample parking were announced when the two churches merged and of undeveloped land, originally part of the Ridgelys' Hampton estate and north of the planned alignment of the Baltimore Beltway (I-695), were purchased soon thereafter from Goucher College. Groundbreaking for the new church, October 7, 1956 A groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 7, 1956, and construction of the new church was completed by the John K. Ruff Company in May 1958, with a service of dedication held on May 11, 1958. A crowd of 1,250 attended the ceremonies in the new sanctuary, with an overflow of 550 persons watching by closed-circuit television in the lower level Fellowship Hall. The old First ME Church structure adjacent to Prospect Hill Park Cemetery on McCurdy Avenue (now Investment Place) and York Road was abandoned and eventually demolished in 1965. An illuminated display of the stained glass windows of the former church is located in the foyer of the current building. The Second ME Church structure was sold in 1954 to the Women's Club of Towson and still stands today--in 2005, the building was resold to an office development firm and is now used by an insurance agency. The erstwhile Epsom Chapel eventually became a meeting hall for boy scout troops in the 1920s‚Äì1930s. It was subsequently abandoned and finally demolished in 1952 to make way for construction of a parking lot for the old Hutzler's department store, now a Barnes & Noble store near the present Macy's department store and Towson Town Center mall. No trace of Epsom Chapel exists today, except for an historical marker placed near the site by the Baltimore County Historical Society, designating it as the \\"cradle of Methodism in Towson\\". The current name, Towson United Methodist Church, was adopted in 1968 to reflect the merger in that year of the Methodist and Evangelical United Brethren denominations in the US. On Pentecost Sunday, May 11, 2008, the fiftieth anniversary of the present sanctuary's completion was celebrated by a reenactment of the original May 11, 1958, dedication service. Current building and facilities Sanctuary interior viewed from the balcony, the organ pipework and windchests are concealed behind the altar screen Towson United Methodist Church is an L-shaped structure, with the main sanctuary on a north-south axis. Designed by architect J. Alfred Hamme and completed in 1958, the church is built of red brick in the Georgian architectural style, with a prominent, floodlighted spire surmounted by a porcelain enamel gold cross visible at 3‚Äì5 mi (5‚Äì8 km) distance on the Beltway. The imposing front facade is of cut stone from Pennsylvania, with the high main entranceway capped by a curved stone pediment. Inside, the sanctuary has three aisles with a rear balcony and can accommodate up to one thousand persons. Rows of Corinthian columns standing on bases flank the pews along both side aisles. The pulpit and doors are made of mahogany. The 3-story east- west wing has classrooms, offices, a chapel, and the John D. Hoffman library featuring an exhibit of memorabilia and historical artifacts along with archival records. Construction of the church cost $950,000 in 1958 (equivalent to almost $7 million in 2008), not including the expense of land acquisition. =Organ and carillon= Towson United Methodist Church has a 3-manual, 48-rank Casavant pipe organ of 2,790 pipes, including seven ranks of 16 ft. pipes and tubular chimes. It was dedicated in memory of S. Clayton Seitz by then-organist John Duwane Hoffman on May 11, 1958. Hoffman, the church's esteemed virtuoso organist and Minister of Music between 1957 and 1988, was a graduate of Union Theological Seminary's renowned Master of Sacred Music degree program, after having earned Bachelor of Music and Master of Music degrees at the University of Denver. He also did post-graduate work at Catholic University of America. At Union, Hoffman studied the organ with Clarence Dickinson and Vernon De Tar. In addition to serving as the church's organist and choral director, Hoffman was professor of organ at Towson State University. He died unexpectedly on July 4, 1988 of complications following heart bypass surgery. The church library is named in his memory. Hoffman was succeeded by Kathie Metz, a graduate of Marshall University, as Director of Music and Organist 1988-2012\\\\. The current Director of Music and Organist since July, 2013, is Douglas Hollida, an ordained minister. According to the church, Hollida studied music at Shepherd University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and then earned a Master of Divinity degree from Trinity Episcopal School for Ministry. World-famous concert organists who have performed at the church's organ include Pierre Cochereau, Flor Peeters, and Marilyn Mason. A two-octave Schulmerich electronic carillon of twenty-five bells was installed in the tower in June 1958. It was played from the organ console by a carillonneur on Sunday mornings before and after services, as well as on special occasions, such as Christmas Eve and as part of the traditional noontime nationwide peal of church bells on the Fourth of July. Hymns were also played daily on the carillon by a music roll until it was discontinued in the 1990s. =Renovation and expansion project= Towson United Methodist Church is in the midst of a $3-million phased renovation and expansion project started in 2006. In the first phase, completed in 2007, an elevator and additional facilities were installed for improved disabled accessibility, along with a new fire sprinkler system and replacement of the building's climate control system (HVAC). Additional classrooms in an expanded education wing are planned in future phases of a multiyear master plan adopted by the church in 2005. Foreground: the church's wooded property, part of which was proposed for development in 2008 To help fund the future works, the church announced plans in January 2008 to sell of undeveloped, wooded property it owns on Hampton Lane to Shelter Development Corp. for construction of a senior citizen housing complex. A zoning change application was submitted to Baltimore County officials to allow sixteen residential units per acre (current zoning limits density to two residential units per acre) for a total of 80-100 beds. The Hampton Improvement Association, representing neighboring Hampton, Maryland residents, said they \\" ...oppose[d] zoning changes that would allow higher density residential development and require trees to be knocked down\\". Then-pastor David Cooney told the Baltimore Sun, \\"We entered into this with Shelter, believing this is a good use for the land ‚Äì that this is a good company and a needed service\\". In the face of community objections, however, Shelter and the church subsequently announced on March 3, 2008, that the development plans had been dropped. A Shelter official said that his company and Towson United Methodist Church had jointly come to the conclusion that \\"this is not something we are going to pursue\\". Cooney said, \\"It had become clear that we weren't going to be able to reach a compromise and we certainly don't want to be at war with our neighbors\\". In the wake of the plan's shelving, the president of the Hampton Improvement Association told the Towson Times that his group wishes to work with Towson United Methodist Church to find an alternative use for the land besides commercial development, as they \\"don't want to preclude the church from trying to get some money out of it.\\" In April 2008, Cooney said that the church \\"did not set out to sell this land; the proposal came to us, and we have no other plans to sell or develop the land\\".David Cooney, High Spire, April 2008. Ministry The church spire, illuminated at night Mark W. Johnson is Lead Pastor of Towson United Methodist Church, succeeding Roderick J. Miller, who retired in June, 2017. Johnson was previously Senior Pastor of Mt. Olive United Methodist Church in Randallstown, Maryland, from August, 2009, to his appointment at Towson UMC beginning July, 2017. He was ordained to the ministry by the United Methodist Church in 1995, following studies at the Iliff School of Theology in Denver, Colorado, where he earned Master of Divinity and Doctor of Ministry degrees. He and his wife Sandi (also an ordained minister in the United Methodist Church), have led mission teams to various nations, including Russia, Kenya, and Honduras. The mission statement of Towson United Methodist Church is: \\"To proclaim the Word of God and to make disciples of Jesus Christ\\". The church's staff of twelve includes assistant ministers, directors of music and education, and building and administrative personnel. It is a part of the denomination's Baltimore- Washington Conference (district). In addition to Sunday morning worship services, the 1,000 member congregation participates in graded Sunday school classes, various adult Bible study classes, youth activities, and a midweek \\"Praise, Prayer & Healing\\" service. The music program includes both adult and youth choirs, as well as handbell ringers. The church's Alleluia Singers, a 50-voice ensemble of high school-age young people, sings frequently for weekly worship services and tours the eastern US each summer. =Previous ministers= Roderick J. Miller was Lead Pastor of Towson United Methodist Church between July 1, 2011, and June 30, 2017. Miller grew up in Pennsylvania, where he graduated from Allegheny College in 1976, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in religion. He then studied at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, DC, earning a Master of Divinity degree in 1982. While ministering at Union Chapel United Methodist Church in Joppa, Maryland, Miller continued his postgraduate studies, receiving a Doctor of Ministry degree in Church Revitalization from Chicago's McCormick Theological Seminary in 1992. He was later Lead Pastor at Bethany UMC church in Ellicott City, Maryland (1994-2005), after which he was named Director of Connectional Ministries for the denomination's Baltimore-Washington Conference, serving in that role 2005-2011\\\\. Prior to Miller, David Cooney was Senior Pastor of Towson United Methodist Church between September 1, 2001, and June 30, 2011. He earned a Master of Divinity degree from Wesley Theological Seminary and a PhD from Iliff School of Theology in Denver. He is the son of C. Douglas Cooney (1928-2003), who was also a Methodist minister at various churches, including the First Methodist Church of Hyattsville, Maryland, as well as an official of the Methodist denomination.

Over the years, members of the Towson Methodist Men's group and Women's Society of Christian Service (now United Methodist Women) have supported Meals on Wheels, the League of Women Voters, and Head Start, as well as serving as volunteers at local hospitals and the Maryland School for the Blind. For more than thirty years, the church has hosted a weekly meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. The large size of the sanctuary and its convenient location make it well-suited for community gatherings attracting sizable crowds, such as concerts by the Handel Choir of Baltimore. The church hosts an annual memorial service for fallen Baltimore County firefighters and rescue personnel. Senior Baltimore County officials, including the County Executive and Fire Chief, participate in the service's memorial wreath laying and the tolling of a bell, as part of the commemoration. Nationally known guest speakers, such as Tony Campolo and Millie Dienert, have also spoken there. Towson United Methodist Church started the Hampton Lane Child Development Center in 1978. An accredited child care center, it now serves approximately fifty children ages 2‚Äì5 years old.

Le chemin de fer (French for \\"the railway\\" or \\"the railroad\\"), Op. 27, is a programmatic √©tude for piano composed by Charles-Valentin Alkan in 1844, frequently cited as the first musical representation of a railway. It is a perpetuum mobile composition at an extremely fast tempo, in D minor, and performance at tempo lasts approximately five minutes.  Composition  The \\"happy passengers\\" melody is not as thick as the main \\"locomotion\\" gauntlet. The composition is marked vivacissimamente (extremely brisk, from vivace), 112 half notes per minute. The first theme is sixteenth notes accompanied by a repetitive ostinato bass in eighth notes, illustrating the fleeting steam locomotive. The second is a more lightweight melody that appears first in the submediant major, B-flat major, then in C major, still comprising just sixteenth notes, which depicts the happy journey of the passengers. The only respite from the torrent comes at the coda, in which the note durations lengthen and the piece comes to a close, portraying the train pulling into a station. The piece's length, in printing (506 measures), not performance (5 minutes), is humorously referred to as describing a very long trip.  Reception  The musical climax, extremely intense and involved, is still played at the same astronomical speed. The most recurrent criticism of the √©tude disparages its banal programmatic nature, and it has been rated very poorly compared with Alkan's other compositions. One writer dismisses it as \\"amusing\\", without technical innovations. Although Alkan demanded strict adherence to the metronome, one analysis of the extreme tempo showed that it is nearly impossible to play at the correct speed, and that at that speed the notes become impossible to distinguish. One published edition agrees with this statement, suggesting that Alkan's metronomic indications do not need to be taken too literally, and most analyses agree, one proposing that there is a printing error and it should be played half as fast (112 quarter notes per minute). The piece's historical accuracy has also been questioned, given that it was composed in 1844, a period in railway history when trains seldom travelled faster than 19 mph (30 km/h). Despite these denigrations, its joyful melody has been celebrated as a forerunner to Arthur Honegger's famous orchestral work, Pacific 231, which also represents a locomotive.

Historically the omnium has had a variety of formats. In recent years, road racing has also adopted the term to describe multi-day races that feature the three primary road race events (time trial, mass start and criterium). History The omnium was re-introduced into the World Championships as a five race track cycling format for men in 2007 and for women in 2009. The omnium was changed in 2010 by the UCI to include the elimination race and the distances of the events were lengthened to favour endurance cyclists. The omnium replaced the individual pursuit, the points race, and the individual time trial at the Summer Olympic Games beginning in 2012. The change received some criticism from cyclist Rebecca Romero, who was left unable to defend her Olympic title. Current omnium Omnium scratch race at the Rio Olympics From June 2014 until the end of 2016, the omnium as defined by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) consisted of the following six events held over 2 days: # Scratch race # Individual pursuit #: 4,000 metres for elite men, 3,000 metres for junior men and elite women, and 2,000 metres for junior women # Elimination race # Time trial #: 1 km men, 500 metres women # Flying lap (against the clock) # Points race #: 40 km for elite men, 25 km for elite women, 25 km for junior men, 20 km for junior women For the first five events, each winner was awarded 40 points, each second place 38 points, each third place 36, etc. Riders ranked 21st and below will each be awarded 1 point. In the Points Race, riders add to and lose points from their totals based on laps gained and lost, and points won in sprints. After the 2016 season, the three timed events - the sprint time trial, flying lap and individual pursuit were all removed from the event, a tempo race added, and the event shortened to a single day. The points race as final race format remains with minor modifications. # Scratch race # Tempo race # Elimination race # Points race #: 25 km for elite men, 20 km for elite women, 20 km for junior men, 15 km for junior women The winner of the Omnium is the rider who has obtained the highest total of points. In the event of a tie in the final ranking, the places in the final sprint of the last event, the Points Race, breaks the tie. A rider must have completed every event in the omnium. Road racing omnium A road race omnium consists of a time trial, a criterium, and a mass-start road race - typically held across a weekend or other 2-3 day period. Points are awarded to the top finishers at each event and totaled at the end of the event. The overall winner for the event is chosen based on the number of accumulated points. Often, organizers will stipulate that riders must complete each event in order to qualify for the overall prize.

It comprises of certain parts of Bihar and Jharkhand of India and adjoining districts of the eastern Terai of Nepal. The native language in Mithila is Maithili, and its speakers are referred to as Maithils. The name Mithila is commonly used to refer to the Videha Kingdom, as well as to the modern-day territories that fall within the ancient boundaries of Videha. In the 18th century, when Mithila was still ruled in part by the Raj Darbhanga, the British Raj annexed the region without recognizing it as a princely state. History=Vedic period= Mithila first gained prominence after being settled by Indo-Aryan peoples who established the Videha kingdom.Michael Witzel (1989), Tracing the Vedic dialects in Dialectes dans les litteratures Indo-Aryennes ed. Caillat, Paris, pages 13, 17 116‚Äì124, 141‚Äì143 During the Later Vedic period (c. 1100‚Äì500 BCE), Videha became one of the major political and cultural centers of Ancient India, along with Kuru and Panchala. The kings of the Videha Kingdom were called Janakas. The Videha Kingdom was later incorporated into the Vajji Confederacy, which had its capital in the city of Vaishali, which is also in Mithila. =Medieval period= From the 11th century to the 20th century, Mithila was ruled by various indigenous dynasties. The first of these were the Karnatas, the Oiniwar Dynasty and the Khandwala Dynasty a.k.a. Raj Darbhanga. The rulers of the Oiniwar Dynasty and the Raj Darbhanga were Maithil Brahmins. It was during the reign of the Raj Darbhanga family that the capital of Mithila was shifted to Darbhanga. Tughlaq had attacked and taken control of Bihar, and from the end of the Tughlaq Dynasty until the establishment of the Mughal Empire in 1526, there was anarchy and chaos in the region. Akbar (reigned from 1556 to 1605) realised that taxes from Mithila could only be collected if there was a king who could ensure peace there. The Brahmins were dominant in the Mithila region and Mithila had Brahmin kings in the past.[citation needed] Akbar summoned Rajpandit Chandrapati Thakur to Delhi and asked him to name one of his sons who could be made caretaker and tax collector for his lands in Mithila. Chandrapati Thakur named his middle son, Mahesh Thakur, and Akbar declared Mahesh Thakur as the caretaker of Mithila on the day of Ram Navami in 1557 AD. Lakshmeshwar Singh (reigned from 1860 to 1898) was the eldest son of Maharaja Maheshwar Singh of Darbhanga. He, along with his younger brother, Rameshwar Singh received a western education from Government appointed tutors as well as a traditional Indian education from a Sanskrit Pandit. He spent approximately ¬£300,000 on relief work during the Bihar famine of 1873‚Äì74. He constructed hundreds of miles of roads in various parts of the Raj, planting them with tens of thousands of trees for the comfort of travellers, as part of generating employment for people effected by famine. He constructed iron bridges over all the navigable rivers He built, and entirely supported, a first-class Dispensary at Darbhanga, which cost ¬£3400; a similar one at Kharakpur, which cost ¬£3500; and largely contributed to many others. Maharaja Lakshmeshwar Singh He built an Anglo-vernacular school at a cost of ¬£1490, which he maintained, as well as nearly thirty vernacular schools of different grades; and subsidised a much larger number of educational institutions. He was also one of the founders of Indian National Congress as well as one of the main financial contributor thereto Maharaja Lakshmeshwar Singh is known for purchasing Lowhter Castle for the venue of the 1888 Allahabad Congress session when the british denied permission to use any public place. The British Governor[who?] commissioned Edward Onslow Ford to make a statue of Lakshmeshwar Singh. This is installed at Dalhousie Square in Kolkata. On the occasion of the Jubilee of the reign of Queen Victoria, Lakshmeshwar Singh was created a Knight Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire, being promoted to Knight Grand Commander in 1897. He was also a member of the Royal Commission on Opium of 1895, formed by British Government along with Haridas Viharidas Desai who was the Diwan of Junagadh. The Royal Opium Commission consisted of a 9-member team of which 7 were British and 2 were Indians and its chairman was Earl Brassey. Geography Mithila is a distinct geographical region with natural boundaries like rivers and hills. It is largely a flat and fertile alluvial plain criss-crossed by numerous rivers which originate from the Himalayas. Due to the flat plains and fertile land Mithila has a rich variety of biotic resources; however, because of frequent floods people could not take full advantage of these resources. Seven major rivers flow through Mithila: Mahananda, Gandak, Kosi, Bagmati, Kamala, Balan, and the Budhi Gandak. They flow from the Himalayas in the north to the Ganges river in the south. These rivers regularly flood, depositing silt onto the farmlands and sometimes causing death or hardship. Culture=Madhubani/Mithila Painting= Madhubani art or Mithila painting is practiced in the Mithila region of India and Nepal. It was traditionally created by the women of different communities of the Mithila region. It is named after Madhubani district of Bihar, India which is where it originated. Major Institute of Art This painting as a form of wall art was practiced widely throughout the region; the more recent development of painting on paper and canvas originated among the villages around Madhubani, and it is these latter developments that may correctly be referred to as Madhubani art.Carolyn Brown Heinz, 2006, \\"Documenting the Image in Mithila Art,\\" Visual Anthropology Review, Vol. 22, Issue 2, pp. 5-33 =Mithila Paag= The Paag is a headdress in the Mithila region of India and Nepal worn by Maithil people. It is a symbol of honour and respect and a significant part of Maithil culture. The Paag dates back to pre-historic times when it was made of plant leaves. It exists today in a modified form. The Paag is wore by the whole Maithil community .The colour of the Paag also carries a lot of significance. The red Paag is worn by the bridegroom and by those who are undergoing the sacred thread rituals. Paag of mustard colour is donned by those attending wedding ceremonies and the elders wear a white Paag. This Paag now features place in the popular Macmillan Dictionary. For now, Macmillan Dictionary explains Paag as ‚Äúa kind of headgear worn by people in the Mithila belt of India.‚Äù https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/dec/26/maithili-paag-finds-place- in-macmillan-dictionary-2081124.htmlPaag On 10 February 2017, India Posts released a set of sixteen commemorative postage stamps on \\"Headgears of India\\". The Mithila Paag was featured on one of those postage stamps. =Language= People of Mithila region speak Maithili primarily and are well versed in other languages like Hindi, Nepali, English, Bhojpuri for other different purposes. While Maithilis living in Nepal also use Nepali language. And some also use Bengali language in significant part of Bihar-Bengal region. This language is an Indo-Aryan language native to the Indian subcontinent, mainly spoken in India and Nepal and is one of the 22 recognised Indian languages. In Nepal, it is spoken in the eastern Terai and is the second most prevalent language of Nepal. Tirhuta was formerly the primary script for written Maithili. Less commonly, it was also written in the local variant of Kaithi. Today it is written in the Devanagari script. =Maithil Cuisine= Maithil cuisine is a part of Indian cuisine and Nepalese cuisine. It is a culinary style which originated in Mithila. Some traditional Maithil dishes are: * Dahi-Chura * Vegetable of Arikanchan * Ghooghni * Traditional Pickles, made of fruits and vegetables which are generally mixed with ingredients like salt, spices, and vegetable oils and are set to mature in a moistureless medium. * Tarua of Tilkor * Bada * Badee * Yogurt * Maachh * Mutton * Irhar * Pidakia ( also known as Gujia) which is basically dumplings. * Makhan Payas * Anarasa * Bagiya People Maithili language speakers are referred to as Maithils and they are an Indo-Aryan ethno-linguistic group. There are an estimated 45 million Maithils in India alone. The vast majority of them are Hindu. The people of Mithila can be split into various caste/clan affiliations such as Brahmins, Kayasthas, Bhumihars, Rajputs, Koeris, Baniyas, Kamatas, Ahirs, Kurmis, Dushads, Koeris and many more.

Recording The album was released on independently in 1997 and the band self-marketed the album to magazines. Afterwards the band signed a record deal with Pleitegeier Records. Musically, the album's style is gothic metal. The output is characterized by distorted power chord guitars, symphonic keyboards, and steril computer drums. Other characteristical elements are Runhardt Scheffler's rough and half growled vocals, a relic from the band's death metal roots. Some vocals are sung by the female singer- guitarist Sandra. Her mid-range, melancholic voice is a very dominant element on songs such as \\"Morgenlied in B√∂ser Zeit.\\" The songstructures on the album are somewhat simple, basing more emphasis on dark, introspective, and decadentic atmosphere rather than rich soundscapes or technical playing. Some of the songs such as \\"Mysterious Night\\" and \\"Eternal Glory\\" contain more traditional guitar playing reminiscent of the early deathrock and gothic rock bands, and cleaner vocals. The production on the album is dry and thin, and the drums and keyboards are more up-front in the mix. The word \\"white\\" in the album title refers to the Christian lyrical themes that collide with gothic dark romantic thematics. The lyrics contain Bible citations on End times on songs such as the outro \\"Voice in the Wilderness.\\" Two of the album's songs are sung in German.Roland, Ludwig. Necromance - White Gothic. CrossOver. Retrieved on 2008-01-08 Reception Although criticized for production issues, varying song material and sometimes playing out of key, the album received positive reviews from the underground media. For example, the German gothic music and subculture magazine Orkus wrote about the album in its November issue in 1997: \\"Metallic guitars combined with hypnotic--melancholic --melodic keyboard sounds, a strongly whispering singing and a beautiful female voice to a symbiosis that is not only fun, but also very fresh sounding!\\" Orkus, 11/97, Germany. ‚ÄûMetallische Gitarren verbinden sich mit hypnotisch - melancholisch - melodischen Keyboardsounds, einem eindringlich fl√ºsternden Gesang und einer sch√∂nen Frauenstimme zu einer Symbiose, die nicht nur abwechslungsreich, sondern auch √§u√üerst neu klingt!

Ben√©t's poem covers the history of the American Civil War. It won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1929. It was written while Ben√©t lived in Paris after receiving a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1926. The poem was performed on Broadway in 1953 in a staged dramatic reading starring Tyrone Power, Judith Anderson, and Raymond Massey, and directed by Charles Laughton. In 2015 the recorded performance was selected for inclusion in the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry for the recording's \\"cultural, artistic and/or historical significance to American society and the nation‚Äôs audio legacy\\". In 2002, the poem, transformed into a play, was performed in San Quentin State Prison by prisoners.

Tulloch was born in Melbourne, the son of Daniel Tulloch and Elizabeth Trethway. Tulloch was a member of the Collingwood side which played in the inaugural VFL season, in 1897. A versatile player who was used at all ends of the ground, Tulloch was appointed Collingwood captain in 1902 and led Collingwood to the premiership that season, putting his name into history as the club's first ever VFL premiership winning captain. Another premiership followed the subsequent season and he remained captain for 1904, which was his final league season. Following his retirement as a footballer, Tulloch served as a VFL umpire, officiating in 64 matches, including the 1907 VFL Grand Final. Tulloch remains the only person in VFL/AFL history to have captained a premiership team and umpired a Grand Final.Atkinson, p. 95. In 1908 Tulloch was assaulted after a match which he had umpired between Melbourne and Geelong. Later that season police struggled to protect Tulloch when he was mobbed by angry fans after a match between Carlton and St Kilda. Tulloch married Sarah Caroline Marshall (1872‚Äì1961) in Carlton, Victoria on 24 September 1903. He died in Carlton, Victoria in 1955. ReferencesSources * Atkinson, G.

He was the son of Qutb al-Din Muhammad. Biography During his father's lifetime, Shams al-Din 'Ali entered the service of the Timurid Shah Rukh as a military commander. In 1414-15 he led the Mihrabanid army and assisted Shah Rukh's forces in putting down a rebellion in Fars.Bosworth, p. 457 He was also active at home, putting down a revolt in northern Sistan against Mihrabanid authority. When Qutb al- Din died in February 1419 the Mihrabanids and the amirs of Sistan decided to proclaim Shams al-Din as his successor. Shams al-Din traveled to Shah Rukh's court and was confirmed as malik of Sistan. In 1420 the Timurid summoned him to assist in a campaign against the Qara Qoyunlu Turkmen. Shah Rukh defeated the army of the Turkmen leader Qara Iskander and occupied Azerbaijan and Armenia in 1421.Roemer, p. 102 Shams al-Din was named governor of Tabriz, a post which he held for two years.Bosworth, p. 458 When he returned to Sistan, Shams al-Din vigorously worked to repair the damage caused by Shah Rukh's invasion of the province during Qutb al-Din's reign. In addition to building irrigation canals, he began the construction of a new city intended to serve as his capital at the end of 1422. Shams al-Din worked on this project for several years; in the midst of this he participated in Shah Rukh's 1434 campaign against the Qara Qoyunlu and returned two years later with builders, masons and carvers from Tabriz to assist in building the city.Bosworth, p. 459. The name of this city was B.r.k. or Mirak. At the same time, Shams al- Din's brother Shah Jalal al-Din became known for founding schools, charities and religious institutions, which drew several prominent scholars to Sistan.

Transfer-based machine translation is a type of machine translation (MT). It is currently one of the most widely used methods of machine translation. In contrast to the simpler direct model of MT, transfer MT breaks translation into three steps: analysis of the source language text to determine its grammatical structure, transfer of the resulting structure to a structure suitable for generating text in the target language, and finally generation of this text. Transfer-based MT systems are thus capable of using knowledge of the source and target languages.  Design  Both transfer-based and interlingua-based machine translation have the same idea: to make a translation it is necessary to have an intermediate representation that captures the \\"meaning\\" of the original sentence in order to generate the correct translation. In interlingua-based MT this intermediate representation must be independent of the languages in question, whereas in transfer-based MT, it has some dependence on the language pair involved. The way in which transfer-based machine translation systems work varies substantially, but in general they follow the same pattern: they apply sets of linguistic rules which are defined as correspondences between the structure of the source language and that of the target language. The first stage involves analysing the input text for morphology and syntax (and sometimes semantics) to create an internal representation. The translation is generated from this representation using both bilingual dictionaries and grammatical rules. It is possible with this translation strategy to obtain fairly high quality translations, with accuracy in the region of 90% (although this is highly dependent on the language pair in question, for example the distance between the two).  Operation  In a rule-based machine translation system the original text is first analysed morphologically and syntactically in order to obtain a syntactic representation. This representation can then be refined to a more abstract level putting emphasis on the parts relevant for translation and ignoring other types of information. The transfer process then converts this final representation (still in the original language) to a representation of the same level of abstraction in the target language. These two representations are referred to as \\"intermediate\\" representations. From the target language representation, the stages are then applied in reverse.  Analysis and transformation  Various methods of analysis and transformation can be used before obtaining the final result. Along with these statistical approaches may be augmented generating hybrid systems. The methods which are chosen and the emphasis depends largely on the design of the system, however, most systems include at least the following stages: * Morphological analysis. Surface forms of the input text are classified as to part-of-speech (e.g. noun, verb, etc.) and sub-category (number, gender, tense, etc.). All of the possible \\"analyses\\" for each surface form are typically made output at this stage, along with the lemma of the word. * Lexical categorisation. In any given text some of the words may have more than one meaning, causing ambiguity in analysis. Lexical categorisation looks at the context of a word to try to determine the correct meaning in the context of the input. This can involve part-of-speech tagging and word sense disambiguation. * Lexical transfer. This is basically dictionary translation; the source language lemma (perhaps with sense information) is looked up in a bilingual dictionary and the translation is chosen. * Structural transfer. While the previous stages deal with words, this stage deals with larger constituents, for example phrases and chunks. Typical features of this stage include concordance of gender and number, and re-ordering of words or phrases. * Morphological generation. From the output of the structural transfer stage, the target language surface forms are generated.  Transfer types  One of the main features of transfer-based machine translation systems is a phase that \\"transfers\\" an intermediate representation of the text in the original language to an intermediate representation of text in the target language. This can work at one of two levels of linguistic analysis, or somewhere in between. The levels are: * Superficial transfer (or syntactic). This level is characterised by transferring \\"syntactic structures\\" between the source and target languages. It is suitable for languages in the same family or of the same type, for example in the Romance languages between Spanish, Catalan, French, Italian, etc. * Deep transfer (or semantic). This level constructs a semantic representation that is dependent on the source language. This representation can consist of a series of structures which represent the meaning. In these transfer systems predicates are typically produced. The translation also typically requires structural transfer. This level is used to translate between more distantly related languages (e.g. Spanish-English or Spanish- Basque, etc.) References See also  * Statistical machine translation Category:Machine translation ","title":"Transfer-based machine translation"},{"id":"15129134","text":"Gmina Nekla is an urban-rural gmina (administrative district) in Wrze≈õnia County, Greater Poland Voivodeship, in west-central Poland.

The two-storey entrance front has four gables with dormers and four substantial irregular stone mullioned bays, one offset incorporating a porch. The Astleys and the Dyotts followed as owners but after the Dyott family moved to nearby Freeford Hall, in 1836, the house was let out to a series of tenants. In 1889, the estate was purchased and occupied by architect and brewer Samuel Lipscomb Seckham, developer of Park Town, Oxford and Bletchley Park, and High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1890. Seckham extended and renovated the house, but following the death of his son Colonel Basset Thorne Seckham in 1926, the estate was sold off, and the house again passed through the hands of tenants. In 1959, the neglected property was sold for redevelopment and was subdivided into several separate residential units.

Critics hailed it as the grittiest and most heartfelt album of Palmer's career. Background Initially approached by guitarist Carl Carlton to contribute to the 2001 Robert Johnson tribute album Hellhound on My Trail, for which Palmer recorded \\"Milk Cow's Calf Blues\\" with Carlton on guitars, Palmer was then invited by Faye Dunaway to provide the soundtrack to her 2001 directorial debut The Yellow Bird, set in Mississippi and New Orleans during the 1940s and 1950s. Palmer took both signs as a good omen, and the impetus for Drive was born. After more thoroughly researching this particular genre of music, Palmer assembled a list of fifty possible tracks, and then began the arduous task of whittling that list down to a manageable set of twelve. The selections from Drive can best be described as a loose collection of both standard and contemporary blues compositions (Robert Johnson, Little Willie John, Keb' Mo'), with a smattering of other genres, including folk (Nicolai Dunger) and calypso (Mighty Sparrow), prompting Palmer to call the end result \\"a gut- buckety swamp thing.\\" Recording and charts The recording and mixing of Drive took place in both Logic Studios (Milan, Italy) and Palmer's home studio (Lugano, Switzerland). Because of the satisfaction and enthusiasm having recorded the initial twelve songs, Palmer decided to cut three more tracks (\\"29 Ways [To My Baby's Door],\\" \\"It Hurts Me Too,\\" \\"Stupid Cupid\\"), this time at the Sphere in London. The album peaked at No. 10 on the US Blues albums chart. Track listing #\\"Mama Talk To Your Daughter\\" (J. B.

It was built by Hans Herkommer from 1927 to 1929, on a rise then known as Ginnheimer H√∂he. The church is an unusual example of interwar modernist church architecture, combining elements of expressionism with the \\"New Objectivity\\" of Bauhaus architecture, and using monumental mosaics for external and internal decoration. The plan to build such a church was developed in 1916 by Hedwig Dransfeld, then chairperson of the Katholischer Deutscher Frauenbund (Catholic German Women's Organisation). The church was meant to represent a prayer for peace in stone and also serve as a memorial for the fallen of the First World War. The foundation money initially collected for the project was lost due to the 1914‚Äì1923 German hyperinflation. The church was finally completed on 5 May 1929 and handed to the Catholic congregation of Bockenheim. It was badly damaged in the Second World War, and afterwards rebuilt with money donated for the purpose. The names of any German soldiers killed or missing in either World War were displayed in the church in return for a donation. Architecture The church, its rectory, and the parish halls form an architectural unit, together with the 18 by 30 metres (59 by 98 ft) memorial yard. The church's west facade is dominated by a 25 metres (82 ft) high portal structure, or tower, subdivided by three high round arches. The middle arch contains a monumental mosaic-covered statue of Mary as Queen of Peace. The mosaic in the left arch depicts the motifs night, mourning and a sword, symbolising war, the one on the right symbolises peace by depicting the sun, happiness and flowers. The mosaics are by the sculptor Emil Sutor. Below the triple-aisled 18 m (59 ft) tall nave, there is a crypt, containing a piet√† by Ruth Schaumann. In the nave, the altar is 2 m above floor level. Above it is a monumental mosaic by Joseph Eberz. It depicts the crucified Jesus, below him Mary, Mother of Jesus, pierced by seven swords. Equipment The organ of the Frauenfriedenskirche was built by the company Siegfried Sauer in H√∂xter in 1996. It has 45 stops, electrical tracker action, three keyboards and pedals.

The Department also provides critical employment service programs to Californians, collect the state's labor market information and employment data, and serve as one of the nation's largest tax agencies through the collection of payroll taxes. EDD employees provide many services, including: * Assisting employers with their labor needs. * Helping job seekers obtain employment, apprenticeships, or vocational training. * Administering the federally-funded workforce investment programs for adults, dislocated workers, and youth. * Assisting disadvantaged recipients in becoming self- sufficient. * Helping unemployed and disabled workers through the administration of the UI and SDI programs. * Supporting state activities and benefit programs by collecting and administering employment-related taxes. History The Legislature in 1935 created the Department of Employment as part of the Unemployment Reserves Act. The act (Statutes 1935, chapter 352) was set up to provide \\"a (monetary) reserve to assist in protecting the public against the social effects of unemployment.\\" The purpose of the department was to operate a statewide system of employment agencies and distribute the payment of unemployment insurance to eligible unemployed workers. As part of Governor Reagan's Reorganization Plan of 1968, the Department of Employment was placed under the Human Relations Agency. With the signing of chapter 1460 that same year, the department became the Department of Human Resources Development, which assumed the duties, purposes, responsibility, and jurisdiction of the former department. The name of the department was again changed in 1974 (chapter 1212), when it became the Employment Development Department.

Description of Africa is a largely firsthand geographical book that was published under the title Della descrittione dell‚ÄôAfrica et delle cose notabili che ivi sono by Giovanni Battista Ramusio in his collection of travellers' accounts Delle navigationi e viaggi in Venice in 1550. It contained the first detailed descriptions published in Europe of the Barbary Coast (modern Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia) and the gold-trading kingdoms of west-central Africa. The book was dictated in Italian by Leo Africanus, the famed Moorish traveler and merchant who had been captured by pirates and sold as a slave. Presented, along with his book, to Pope Leo X, he was baptized and freed. Leo, whose name he took in baptism, suggested that he recast his Arabic work in Italian; it was completed in 1526.The date on the sole surviving manuscript, in the Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emmanuele, MS 953. It was republished repeatedly by Ramusio in his Delle navigationi e viaggi, translated into French and into Latin for the erudite, both in 1556. The Descrittione is in nine books, an introductory book and an appendix on rivers and fauna and flora, with seven books between, each describing a kingdom: the kingdoms of Marrakesh, Fez, Tlemcen and Tunis, and the regions of Numidia, the sub-Saharan regions, and Egypt. The work circulated in manuscript form for decades. It was in Ramusio's manuscript that Pietro Bembo read it and was astonished: \\"I cannot imagine how a man could have so much detailed information about these things\\", he wrote to a correspondent, 2 April 1545.Black 2002:264 and note The book's importance stemmed from its accuracy at a time when the area was little known to Europeans,Other European works concerning Africa were Azurara's Cronica do Descobrimento e Conquista de Guin√© (not translated until the twentieth century), Francisco Alv√°rez, Narrative of the Portuguese Embassy to Abyssinia (to give it its English title, it being also issued in French from 1556 onwards), and Frigius' Historia de Bello Africano (1580), with a circulation limited to savants. and its publication at precisely the moment when Latin Christian power was on a collision course with the Ottoman Empire in the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe, while at the same time Western Africa was becoming more accessible to Europeans.

A twentieth-century rediscovery of the originally-dictated manuscript revealed that Ramusio, in smoothing the grammar of Leo Africanus's text had coloured many neutral details,Modern editors have taken him to task, such as D. Perocco, Viaggare e raccontare (Alexandria) 1997:55, noted in Black 2002:268 note37. to make it more palatable to Christian European audiences; French and English translators added further embellishments.

His high-relief sculptures in terracotta, resin, and bronze have been exhibited widely in Europe and his work is known for its unusual approach to perspective. Major works include: * Brussels ‚Äî An Urban Comedy, a long terracotta frieze in the Royal Galleries of Saint-Hubert in Brussels * The Battle of Britain Monument on the Victoria Embankment in London * The Meeting Place, a tall bronze sculpture inside St Pancras railway station in London, surrounded by a frieze (see below). * Iraq and Afghanistan Memorial (2017), in Victoria Embankment Gardens In 2008 a high-relief frieze was added to the base of The Meeting Place as part of refurbishments at St Pancras, featuring images from the history of the Tube and train: people queuing on platforms or travelling in carriages; soldiers departing for war and returning injured, and repair works following the 7 July 2005 London bombings. The work was the object of controversy when first erected, as one panel depicted a commuter falling into the path of a train driven by the Grim Reaper. However, following discussions with London and Continental Railways (LCR), this panel was replaced with another. Day studied at art schools in the UK at Colchester and Dartington, and completed his training at Cheltenham in 1991. He now lives in a village near Dijon, France, with his French wife, Catherine. Their Anglo- French relationship is an explicit and repeated theme in his works. The Meeting Place, which is modelled on an embrace between Paul and Catherine, stands as a metaphor for St Pancras's role as the terminus of the rail link between England and France. Another contemporary sculptor and critic, Antony Gormley, singled out The Meeting Place when he condemned the current public art works across the UK, stating: \\"there is an awful lot of crap out there\\". Day admitted that \\"Some will say it is a chocolate box sculpture.\\" In December 2017, Day received criticism for accepting a commission to create a sculpture in Moscow of the late Uzbek leader Islam Karimov, \\"widely regarded as one of the most ruthless dictators in recent history\\", and responded, \\"I go with the flow\\".

Ireland, being an island nation, was dependent on the sea for all forms of movement external to the island as well as for many goods, particularly fuels that were required to keep the economy going. There was therefore a resurgence of interest in all things to do with the sea. Role 1941, as can be seen, was a critical time in Irish history. Some of the Institute founders, including the longest serving President, Colonel Anthony Lawlor with other supporters, who had been impressing on the government and public, over more than a five-year period, that another European war was inevitable and Ireland with a dependence on maritime links would quickly fall into crisis. The Institute ran a series of activities supporting their objectives given above with public lectures on maritime themes, public film shows on similarly related subjects and managing their positive inputs to the public press and popular media of the day as well as the specialised maritime press. A programme of Maritime Weeks, with poster displays, lectures, film-nights, public library displays of maritime material were organised and deputations to the government were arranged. From these initial activities and the ongoing interest generated, the National Maritime Museum of Ireland, operating both a library and museum, was formed. Achievements 1943-45 First and Second Maritime Weeks held in Dublin 1945 Irish Maritime Survey launched, later taken over by Irish Shipping and organised as Follow the Fleet in 1967. 1949 Schools \\"Ship Adoption Scheme\\" launched 1952 Annual Seafarers Memorial Services inaugurated in Dublin 1955 Winter Film Show and later public lectures commenced in Dublin 1956 Institutes Research Department opened under John de Courcy Ireland.

Captain Halpin had made history by laying the first successful oceanic cables in the North and South Atlantic and Indian Oceans as well as the Mediterranean Sea. The ship used for this work was Brunel designed Great Eastern, which for nearly half a century was the world‚Äôs largest steamship. A model of this, made under Halpin‚Äôs supervision, is one of the famous items in the Institute‚Äôs \\"Halpin collection\\". Foundation of an Irish Maritime Fleet The Irish Marine Service played an important role in setting up the first Irish fisheries protection fleet. Seamus √ì Muiris, a former officer in the Royal Navy, had made persistent representations to successive Irish governments, favouring the creation of a fleet and was appointed as its Commander, when approved. In this, he had been strongly supported by Colonel Anthony Lawlor, the wartime Commander of the Marine Coast Watching Service. The first vessel purchased by the government was the HMY Helga, which was renamed Muirch√∫ after independence.

Childhood Reeve was born in Waunakee, Wisconsin, on March 27, 1902. He was one of twins, his brother was Richard. Their parents were Hubert and Mae Reeve. Mae died in 1904, and their father remarried, leaving the boys to fend for themselves. Bob and Richard went their separate ways early in life. Reeve was fascinated by aviation from an early age, and studied all he could on the subject. He enlisted in the US Army aged 15 in 1917. Discharged from the Army at the end of the war, Reeve had reached the rank of sergeant. He wanted to re-enlist, but his father was against this so Reeve returned to school, but dropped out after a few months and went to San Francisco. From there he got passage as an ordinary seaman to Shanghai, where he took a job in the Chinese Maritime Customs Service, serving on the Yangtze and Taku rivers. In 1921, Reeve was working in Vladivostok, USSR, but returned home as a result of his father's pleading.Hall of Fame Inductee: Robert C. Reeve. Wisconsin Aviation Hall of Fame. Reeve finished high school, and then entered the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1922, his brother already being there. A picture of the aviator Carl Ben Eielson was on the wall at the fraternity house, this inspired Reeve, George Gardner, Monk MacKinnon and Ora McMurray to skip classes to spend time at Madison airfield, where Cash Chamberlain had a Curtiss Jenny. Six months short of graduation, all four were expelled from the university. This pushed them further into aviation, with Gardner and MacKinnon becoming President and Vice-President respectively of Northwest Airlines. Barnstorming days Reeve headed to Florida, then to Beaumont, Texas where he joined a pair of barnstormers‚Äî\\"Hazard\\" and \\"Maverick\\". In exchange for two months' work at the airfield, Reeve got three hours flying instruction (which was called five) and soloed. When the Air Commerce Act of 1926 came into force, he got one of the first Engine and Aircraft Mechanic's Licenses and his Commercial Pilot's License. Reeve joined the Army Air Corps at March Field, but was discharged after a short time. South America Ford Trimotor. Lockheed Vega 5B By the late 1920s, barnstorming wasn't a viable way to make a living. Pan Am teamed up with W. R. Grace and Company to bid for an airmail contract in South America. The new airline, Pan American-Grace Airways (Panagra) flew weekly airmail from the US to Lima, Peru via the Canal Zone. A Ford Trimotor was purchased and Reeve trained with the Ford Motor Company on these aircraft, delivering the first to Lima in August 1929. Panagra offered Reeve the chance to fly Airmail Route 9 from Lima to Santiago, Chile, at this time the longest aviation route in the world at . In 1930 the route was extended to Montevideo, Uruguay. It was during this time that Reeve learned about bush flying, developing techniques to avoid coastal fog, which would later serve him in Alaska, and mountain flying skills. He established a speed record between Santiago and Lima, covering the 1,900 miles in 20 hours. In January 1932, he crashed a Lockheed Vega of Panagra at Santiago, and quit before he was fired. Alaska Reeve's move to Alaska came as the result of unrelated incidents. He had met a Klondike prospector, \\"Swiftwater Bill\\" Gates, in Chile, who had told him of the Gold Rush thirty years earlier. He had also talked to Eddie Craig, a mining engineer at the Kennicott Copper Mine in Alaska in the early 1900s. These stories, and the idea that there was new country to conquer pulled Reeve north. He returned home to Wisconsin, where he suffered a slight attack of polio, which affected one of his legs slightly. Reeve stowed away on a steamship, arriving in Alaska with $2 in his pocket, and Valdez, Alaska with 20¬¢. At Valdez airfield, Owen Meals had a wrecked Eaglerock aircraft with a Wright J-5 engine that had been a spare for Sir Hubert Wilkins when he made his flight across the North Pole to Spitsbergen. Reeve worked for a month at $1 an hour repairing the plane, and then leased the plane from Meals at $10 an hour. Having created a landing strip, Reeve was in business. His first charter was to Middleton Island, where the beach looked fine to land on, but the aircraft sank up to its wheels in the soft sand. An old block and tackle was found and used to rescue the aircraft from the incoming tide. Reeve managed to take off, and attempted to fly back to Valdez, but was forced to land at Seward owing to a storm. When he eventually got back to Valdez his tanks were almost empty, and he hadn't earned a cent. Reeve said this trip was worth $1,000 in experience. Reeve quickly learnt that the bush pilot's biggest worry was paying for gas, which could be $0.25 a gallon in one place, and $1.50 in another. That winter, Reeve was hired to fly supplies to Chisana at 20¬¢/lb, his base for this was at Christochina, where a small airstrip had been created with high obstacles each end of the runway. Oil in the aircraft engines had to be drained each night, and warmed up on a stove each morning before being returned to the engine, as it was so cold that the oil would freeze. Reeve made a $2,000 profit on the Chisana route and had heard of a Fairchild 51 for sale in Fairbanks. This was the type of aircraft he had used in the Andes. He bought it for $3,500, with $1,500 down and the balance within two years. Reputation earned Reeve's first trip in the Fairchild was to fly Mr and Mrs Ole Hay and their two children, aged 4 and 4 months, to Nome. Just out of McGrath, they ran into dense ice-fog, a complete white out, so Reeve landed on the frozen Kateel River and the made camp. After 25 hours, conditions had improved sufficiently for them to continue as far as Shaktoolik. It took three days to get to Nome, and another ten days before he could leave for Valdez, picking up a medical emergency in Shaktoolik on the way. Again Reeve had to land because of the weather, this time landing on the Skwentna River. Reeve flew the patient to Seward the next day, and when he eventually returned to Valdez, Reeve found that stories of his outward trip were in the newspapers. He was officially initiated into the ranks of the Heroic Bush Pilots. Tilly In March 1933, Reeve took an order into Chisana. On the way back to Valdez his engine quit and he made a forced landing by Mount Wrangell. He and his passenger used snowshoes to walk the to the Nabesna Mine, where owner Carl Whitham assisted them. They returned to Valdez for help, got the spare parts to repair the engine and flew back to the plane, where the three men repaired the engine, using a tree to hoist it clear of the aircraft. During the Great Depression, there was constant talk of reopening the gold mines. One of the biggest was the Big Four Mine on the Brevier Glacier, only from Valdez, but at and elevation of . Clarence Poy of San Francisco said he would buy the mine if Reeve flew his supplies and men in. Reeve took the current owner, Jack Cook to the mine to inspect it. The landing spot turned out not to be as good as had been claimed, but although the aircraft was partially buried in soft snow, no damage was done. Reeve later marked out a landing strip with flags and lamp black. Reeve's success with supplying the Big Four Mine let to further contracts with other mines; the Mayfield, Little Giant and Ramsay Rutherford. During this time, Reeve learned more about assessing suitability of landing sites from the air, and developed the technique of dropping supplies by air. Miners being so keen on getting their supplies that they would pay for another load if supplies were damaged when dropped. In 1934, the price of gold almost doubled under the New Deal Gold Reserve Act and Valdez boomed. In the summer of 1934, Reeve's exploits, including landing on mudflats (having manufactured skis from stainless steel to fit to his aircraft) regularly reached the papers. He received some fan letters, including one from Miss Janice , who asked if he needed an extra hand. Janice lived about 30 miles from Reeve's hometown. They corresponded for a few months and Janice flew to Valdez in June 1935. Reeve left on a prospecting trip to Canada, but his curiosity got the better of him and he returned within a month. When he first saw her she reminded him of \\"Tilly the Toiler\\" and thus the nickname stuck. Fairchild 71. Reeve tried his hand at mining, and joined with prospector Andy Thompson to prospect the Ruff & Tuff Mine. He went to Canada in 1936 to try placer mining to finance the Ruff & Tuff. The mining didn't pay, so Reeve returned to Valdez flying supplies. He earned enough money to buy basic equipment for the Ruff & Tuff and later he and Thompson sold the mine, with Reeve getting the contract to supply it. Tilly had returned to San Francisco in the meantime, but she returned in April 1936. Reeve decided that despite his sporadic income, he would marry Tilly and so they were married in Fairbanks. Reeve bought another plane, a Fairchild 71 to celebrate. Expedition Reeve made several modifications to his plane, which he tried to keep from the local inspector. When questioned about these, his answers resulted in official approval from the inspector for the modifications. Reeve received a letter from Bradford Washburn in January 1937 asking if he could fly a party of climbers to the glacier at the base of Mount Lucania in Canada. Reeve agreed to undertake the task. In April, the bulk of the supplies were flown in. When he flew Washburn and Robert Bates to the site, the weather had turned unseasonably warm and the plane sank up to its belly in slush. It was over a week before Reeve could take off, after the temperature had dropped sufficiently for a crust of ice to form over the slush. The trip was described by Reeve as the \\"most hazardous\\" of his career, but he had set a new world record of for the highest landing on skis, more than higher than any in either the Arctic or Antarctic. The day after the Washburn trip, the engine of the Fairchild 51 quit. Reeve spent eight months repairing the Wright Whirlwind engine, but never put it back in the aircraft. He was now back to only one. Reeve made his last glacier landing in 1938, when he flew Brad Washburn to the Mount Marcus Glacier. His brother Richard was killed in a plane crash in 1938 and in the spring of 1939 a storm overturned the Fairchild 71. He spent all summer repairing it, only for the hangar to burn down with the aircraft inside. Reeve bought another Fairchild 71 and spent a further month repairing it. At this time, the CAA came in to regulate flying in Alaska. Pilots were assigned routes under a \\"grandfather rights\\" scheme based on the territory they had served for four months prior to August 22, 1938. Reeve was given a small area around Copper River. The work available wouldn't support a growing family (at this time they had two children, Richard and Roberta) so they left Valdez in January 1941 for Fairbanks. The war years Reeve arrived in Fairbanks and had to borrow $65 to pay his first month's rent. Noel Wien gave Reeve his first charter, and a lifelong friendship was formed. In April 1941, Reeve was one of a few pilots in Alaska without a certified route, and was hired by the CAA to survey the many new airfields planned to be built as part of Hap Arnold's master plan for Alaska's defense. While the Army and Navy concentrated on building bases at Anchorage and in the Aleutian Islands, the CAA was responsible for constructing the airfields in the interior. The first to be built was the airfield at Northway, east of Fairbanks. The contractors were the Morrison- Knudsen company (M-K). Supplies were trucked via the Richardson Highway and a summer trail to the Nasbena Mines, 60 miles from the airfield site, and then flown by Reeve to Northway, where an airstrip had been hacked out of the woods. Some items had to be cut into two or three pieces and re-welded at the destination as they were too big or heavy for the Fairchild. Although Reeve was working from dawn to dusk, he couldn't keep up with demand for supplies at Northway, and a backlog built up at Nabesna. M-K ordered a Boeing 80A and Reeve was sent to Seattle to collect it. It took five weeks to modify the plane, and when he returned with it to Northway, found a runway at what was now Reeve Field. The 80A was designed to haul but Reeve soon found he could haul in it. Reeve was again flying from dawn to dusk, sometimes on only two engines. With the money earned from the CAA contract, Reeve ordered three more aircraft. He bought another Boeing 80A, a Hamilton Metalplane and another Fairchild 71. The army wanted him to survey a route for a railroad from Prince George, BC, to Nome. Reeve took the surveyors along the route but on the homeward trip the aircraft‚Äîa Fairchild‚Äîbroke through the ice on the Kluane Lake. The aircraft was abandoned but the mission successfully completed. The pass was named Reeve Pass, it is located between Francis Lake and the Salmon River. The Fairchild was left at Burwash Landing, and Reeve hired a pilot to fly the Hamilton from Washington to Alaska. The plane crashed in Washington, killing the pilot and Reeve was broke again, not having enough money even to buy the fuel to fly the Boeing to Alaska. He managed to borrow money from the Pacific National Bank despite them having a rule never to lend to bush pilots. Fairchild FC-2W-2. Reeve flew back to Juneau unannounced, and was almost shot down because he didn't identify himself. He returned to working for the CAA, now earning $80 an hour with fuel supplied flying supplies, materials and workers to the new airfields being constructed at Big Delta, Tanacross, Galena, Moses Point and Nome, doing all the flying and maintenance himself and regularly working 15-hour days. In November 1942 Reeve signed a contract with the Alaska Communications System (ACS) and moved his family to Anchorage. The contract with ACS involved flying all over Alaska, the Aleutians and western Canada. On July 5, 1943, Reeve was flying radar equipment and four technicians from Cold Bay to Amchitka when he ran into zero-zero visibility conditions. During 1942 Reeve purchased a Fairchild FC-2W-2. A forced landing was made 20 miles east of Cold Bay. Reeve managed to salvage his radio, but the uninsured plane was written off. The delay in the delivery of the radar parts allowed the Japanese to evacuate Kiska undetected, which may have saved American lives, as when US forces landed on Kiska they found it deserted. Previously the Battle of Attu had cost 500 lives.geocities Reeve fleet list. Reeve's thoughts turned to post-war activities. He knew he would need bigger, faster planes and thought his best hope would be to pick an area that no one else wanted. Reeve bought a hardware store on Fourth Avenue, Anchorage. An old friend, Carl Whitham came to Anchorage, and they formed a partnership to develop some of Whitham's old prospects. Whitham died of cancer in the spring and Reeve's prospecting days were over. In 1946, Reeve formed Reeve Aleutian Airways and was its president until his death in 1980. He allowed his pilots license to lapse in 1948 after he caught himself missing an item on a checklist. Reeve was invited to run for territorial governor of Alaska in 1952, but decided against this due to a conflict of interests. Reeve received an honorary Doctor of Science degree at the University of Alaska in 1963. Reeve was named \\"Alaskan of the Year\\" in 1972 and inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1975. He was made honorary Mayor of Shemya in 1978. He died on August 25, 1980, and in that year was inducted into the International Aerospace Hall of Fame.

It was part of a series of events that occurred within 1933, which marked the brutality and resilience of the Nazi party. From here on life for thousands of Germans would be controlled and monitored for those dubbed as ‚Äòsocial outcasts‚Äô. Not only were many killed; others were forced into Nazi concentration camps in order to allow the German economy to flourish and eradicate opposition to the Nazi Party. The Act in particular portrayed some of the Nazis' key political and philosophical policies.  Overview  The Malicious Practices Act was a measure introduced to rid the German state of its ‚Äòoppressors‚Äô and ‚Äòenemies‚Äô. In particular, the Nazi state imposed new legislation that made it illegal to speak wrongly of, or criticise the regime and its leaders. The two key guidelines were that of Protective Custody and Preventative Custody. Preventative Custody was aimed at the undesirables within society, for example paupers, homosexuals and Jews. Those who were unfortunate enough to fall into this category could be arrested even if an offence had not been committed. Homosexuality was a criminal offense in Weimar and Nazi Germany. Protective custody, however, was aimed at the regime's political opponents, in particular those from the left, such as the communists and the social democrats. The state made it apparent that those who failed to comply with Nazi ideology and politics could be arrested for the ‚Äòprotection of the state‚Äô. In particular this was in an attempt to eliminate other political parties from German politics and eradicate their presence permanently. A circular of the Reich and Prussian Minister of Interior, produced on 14 December 1937, stated: \\"...those to be considered A-Social are persons who demonstrate through behaviour towards the community, when may not in itself be criminal, that they will not adopt themselves to the community. \\"The following are examples of asocial: \\"Persons who through minor, but repeated, infractions of the law demonstrate that they will not adapt socialist state, e.g. beggars, tramps, whores, alcoholics with contagious diseases, particularly transmitted diseases, who evade the measures taken by the public health authorities.\\"  Background  After being appointed Chancellor on 30 January 1933, Hitler still faced huge problems. The Nazi party at this time only held a third of all seats in the Reichstag, thus lacking an overall elected majority. As such the Nazis looked at ways to gain support and elections were called for 5 March 1933. At this point Hermann G√∂ring became one of Hitler‚Äôs key allies during the period. He was appointed Minister of Interior and sought ways to improve Nazi support. His initial success through bargaining came in the form of donated support from industrialists, who supported the Nazis by providing them with 3million Reichmarks. G√∂ring was ruthless in his attack on the German state police. He quickly began sacking senior police officers in order to replace them with key Nazi supporters. Alongside this, he infiltrated the police force by recruiting 50,000 members of the SA to work as Auxiliary Police, (later to be known as The Gestapo). Their uniformed presence alone gained the support of ordinary Germans who sought change. Nevertheless their existence brought fear and intimidation amongst the others, something which came to a head on 27 February 1933. The Reichstag fire, which took place on 27 February 1933, was the perfect pretext for the Nazis to launch an attack on their fiercest rivals, the Communists and other left wing parties. Nonetheless the Decree that followed, ‚ÄúDecree of the President of the Reich for the Protection of People and State‚Äù (otherwise known as The Emergency Decree) prevented the communists and socialists from taking part in the Election campaign. This was pursued through the mass arrests of political party leaders and the closure of party newspapers.  Specific measures  Although there had been a surge of violence and intimidation exerted by the Nazis prior to the passing of the Act, it was by no means as violent and resilient. Mass arrests were introduced in order to round up members of the socialists and communist parties. \\"Around 10,000 Communists and Socialists were arrested in March and April. By June, the numbers in ‚Äòprotective custody‚Äô-most of the workers- had doubled. A good number of those arrested were the victims of denunciations by neighbours of workmates. So great was the wave of denunciations following the Malicious Practices Act of 21 March 1933 that even the police criticised it.\\" Homosexuals in particular were hard done by through the act, as they were subject to the implications of both guidelines. Above all, they did not fit into the Nazis ideal for the German race and as such were seen as a direct threat to the Nazi‚Äôs policy of Gleichschaltung.  Consequences  On the 22 March 1933; Dachau concentration camp was officially opened. Yet time has shown that conditions within concentration camps were harsh, dangerous and eventually, murderous. The Nuremberg laws were also introduced to stamp out any Jewish presence. Passed in 1935 at the annual party rally, the laws had two basic aims. Firstly the law for the protection of German blood and German honour was passed, which prohibited marriage and extra-marital intercourse between Jews and Germans. Secondly, the Reich Citizenship Law was also passed, which stripped Jews of their citizenship. However, anti-Jewish prejudice and violence did not end here, with events radicalising during Kristallnacht on 10 November 1938. Finally, the passing of the Enabling Law would have been fairly impossible without the Malicious Practices Act. As the SA and SS had surrounded the representative buildings no elected officials were able to vote other than the Nazis and their supporters. As such the Act was passed with ease and consequently this gave Hitler complete dictatorial powers, hence beginning the radicalisation and implementation of total Nazi rule.

Early life Sprigg was born in Ipswich, England, into a strongly Puritan family. His father was a pastor and his strictly conservative up-bringing had a lifelong effect on Sprigg's values (until the end of his life, one of Sprigg's proudest claims was that his ancestor had been one of Oliver Cromwell's chaplains). He was educated at Ipswich School, as well as a series of other private schools. He started his career in a shipbuilder's office, and then switched jobs to become a short-hand writer and reporter. However, his fragile health caused him to emigrate to the Cape Colony in 1858 to recuperate, and here he decided to settle. He managed to acquire a free farm in what was known at the time as British Kaffraria (near what is today East London), and began to get involved in local politics. His newly acquired property lay near the Cape's frontier, and was therefore surrounded by a large population of non-Christian Xhosa people ‚Äì whom Sprigg regarded with considerable suspicion. This led him to become very concerned about issues of frontier security, and he regularly prioritised such issues in his political career.R. Kent Rasmussen:Dictionary of African historical biography. University of California Press, 1989. . p.698 Political career In 1869, he became the member of the Cape Parliament for East London. He notably ran the Commission for Frontier Defense which recommended that the defence of the Cape Colony be separately administered for the Eastern and Western halves of the Colony and (ominously) that the Cape's defences be racially segregated. Both suggestions were rejected outright by the Prime Minister at the time, John Molteno, a strong advocate of racial and regional unity in the Cape.Molteno, P. A. The Life and Times of John Charles Molteno. Comprising a History of Representative Institutions and Responsible Government at the Cape, Volume II. London: Smith, Elder & Co., Waterloo Place, 1900. p.214. Sprigg nonetheless joined Molteno's movement for responsible government, and in June 1875 he added his voice to those of other prominent local politicians (such as Saul Solomon, John X. Merriman and Molteno himself) in condemning as impractical Lord Carnarvon's ill-advised scheme to confederate southern Africa under British rule. Lord Carnarvon nevertheless pushed ahead and replaced the Cape governor with his own political ally Henry Bartle Frere with the intent of forcing the region into confederation, and Sprigg, along with fellow parliamentarian John Paterson, prudently re-aligned themselves as pro-federalists. Sprigg was to remain a federalist for the remainder of his career. As the previous opposition leader, John X. Merriman converted and joined the Molteno government, Sprigg and Paterson became the de facto leaders of the opposition. As the machinations began for bringing the neighbouring states into the British confederation, tensions between the British Empire and the Cape government increased. Molteno himself had a deep suspicion of British interference in southern Africa, citing what he believed to be its incompetence and injustice, and he stubbornly obstructed British deployment of imperial troops against the neighbouring Xhosa. Offers of titles and threats of dismissal failed to persuade him to back down, and an inevitable collision loomed between the Cape government and the British Empire. Illustrated History of South Africa. The Reader's Digest Association South Africa (Pty) Ltd, 1992. . p.182, \\"Confederation from the Barrel of a Gun\\" =First Ministry (1878‚Äì1881)= In 1878, Governor Frere appealed to the authority of the British Colonial Office to suspend the elected Cape government, and assumed direct control of the country. Frere's first attempts to find a replacement government were unsuccessful, as the Cape's most influential local leaders all refused his request to take office. Frere then turned to Sprigg, his closest local ally, and offered him the position of Prime Minister and Colonial Secretary. In spite of the frontier war, Sprigg famously left his family and farm on the border immediately, to assist Frere in forming a new Cape government. It was a favour which Frere greatly valued, and, writing to Carnarvon (12 January 1879), he praised the important and historic role played by \\" .. the gallant little English farmer, who left his \\"laager\\" on the rebel frontier to help me when the Molteno-Merriman conspiracy to humble Sir Arthur Cunynghame, and through him the English Government, was so nearly successful.\\" Frere appointed Sprigg on condition that he supported confederation, so Sprigg dutifully began making arrangements for a \\"Federal Conference\\" in June 1880. However, local Cape opposition to it was so strong and widespread that Sprigg had to give up on the idea. Elsewhere in southern Africa, Frere's attempts to enforce confederation were sparking wars with the Xhosa, the Zulu Kingdom, the Pedi and the Transvaal Republic. A consequence of this was that Sprigg was Prime Minister during the disastrous First Boer War (1880‚Äì1881). This period also saw massive spending on defence and the accumulation of a large government debt. In response, Sprigg revived the deeply unpopular hut tax which had been terminated by his predecessor (Act 11 of 1872).JF. Ade Ajayi: Africa in the Nineteenth Century Until the 1880s. UNESCO. 1989. At the time of taking office, Sprigg faced a parliament which was overwhelmingly supportive of the previous government which Frere had deposed. Sprigg's ability to assume office, and garnering the required majority in the elected Cape Parliament, was due to several key factors. Firstly, Frere placed the considerable authority of the Crown and the British Empire behind Sprigg. Secondly, the representative of the Molteno government, in its public response to Frere's action, made the strategic error of attacking the legitimacy of the Governor and thereby of the authority of the British Crown itself. Expressing anti-imperialist sentiments could be highly offensive in conservative Victorian society, and in the wartime atmosphere, Molteno's party consequently lost the majority of its parliamentary support. Eventually, the most influential MP at the time, Saul Solomon, cautiously gave his support to Sprigg, who was then able to take office with the required majority.Basil T. Hone: The First Son of South Africa to be Premier: Thomas Charles Scanlen. Oldwick, New Jersey: Longford Press, 1993. p.61. An early cartoon of John Gordon Sprigg holding the national budget. Sprigg's terms in office were often characterised by a notoriously unsustainable fiscal policy. Unlike the preceding, relatively mixed government, Sprigg's cabinet was an exclusively British ministry, dominated by pro-imperialist English politicians who all hailed, like Sprigg himself, from the Eastern Province. His government consequently came to be known as the \\"Settler Ministry\\".Basil T. Hone: The First Son of South Africa to be Premier: Thomas Charles Scanlen. Oldwick, New Jersey: Longford Press, 1993. p.50. With Governor Henry Bartle Frere's support, Sprigg finally succeeded in implementing the conclusion of his Commission for Frontier Defense, which had been fiercely blocked by the previous government. This involved the disarming of all Black Africans in the Cape, including the soldiers and citizens in its own armed forces. His resultant \\"Peace Preservation Act\\" (1878) caused immediate uprisings across the country, that swiftly flared into overt wars. Against the advice of many in parliament, Sprigg went ahead with applying the act in Basutoland ‚Äì at the time administered by the Cape. The resulting Basuto Gun War, together with continued conflict with the Xhosa, saw the Cape government dragged towards bankruptcy. In fact, colonial instigation and mis-management of the Basuto Gun War is one of the main reasons why Lesotho eventually became an independent country, and not part of modern South Africa.F. Statham: Blacks, Boers, & British: A Three-cornered Problem. MacMillan & Co. 1881. Sprigg's harsh \\"native policy\\" also involved calling in British Imperial troops to suppress Black African resistance, the confiscation of traditional lands, and the expansion of white settlement into Black African territory. This policy eventually crushed and subsumed the last independent Xhosa state, but led to the 1880 Transkeian Rebellion and a further string of conflicts elsewhere in southern Africa. Rising costs from the lingering wars forced him to cut back on infrastructure projects such as railway construction and other public works. Even his predecessor's veterinary bureau was closed.Gilfoyle, D. Veterinary Science and Public Policy at the Cape Colony, 1877‚Äì1910. Thesis at the University of Oxford, p.48. In spite of his good relationship with the British Colonial Office, Sprigg had little grass-roots support locally, and when Frere was recalled to London to face charges of misconduct, his government fell. He was succeeded as Prime Minister by locally born Thomas Charles Scanlen. Sprigg's subsequent terms as Prime Minister came at a time of increased tension between the colonists of British origin and the Afrikaners, tension that was sharply exacerbated by the Confederation attempt and the subsequent rise of the Afrikaner Bond. These disagreements eventually culminated in the Second Boer War. This era also saw the origin of the South African Customs Union, and a slow but steady erosion of the rights of the Cape's Black citizens. =Second Ministry (1886‚Äì1890)= Sprigg got an opportunity for a second term as Prime Minister when Thomas Upington resigned due to ill-health. His second term was dominated by two major issues: the voting rights of Black African citizens of the Cape, and the issue of railways. The Cape constitution guaranteed equal voting rights for citizens of all races through its \\"Cape Qualified Franchise\\" system, however Sprigg was concerned about the rapid political mobilisation of the Cape's large and growing African population. In addition, the recent annexation (during Sprigg's first Ministry) of the Transkei Xhosa lands meant that, for the first time, Xhosa people now comprised a majority of the Cape's population. Black African voters already formed a majority of the electorate in several Cape constituencies, and were beginning to form a considerable voting block, especially in the Eastern Cape where he resided. He circumvented this with his Registration Bill in 1887, which excluded communal land-owners from voting and thus effectively disenfranchised a large proportion of the Cape's Black African citizens. (His successor as Prime Minister, Cecil John Rhodes, was to take these changes even further, by raising the franchise requirements in the Cape Colony and thus further countering the growing preponderance of Black and mixed-race voters.) This massive disenfranchisement faced furious resistance both from liberal parliamentarians and from Black political organisations who were strong supporters of the original non-racial franchise. However, through persistence and mastery of parliamentary procedure, Sprigg successfully passed the measure.J.L. McCracken: The Cape Parliament, 1854‚Äì1910. London: Caledon Press. 1967. He was much less successful in his railway policy. His attempts to extend the Cape's railways to Natal and the Transvaal Republic failed, due to the continued tensions remaining from the earlier confederation scheme and its resultant wars. In addition, his 1889 railway proposals were massively impractical and expensive. The costs came to 7,500,000 pounds and caused his second ministry to fall on 16 July 1890. =Third Ministry (1896‚Äì1898)= Drawing of John Gordon Sprigg as Prime Minister in September 1897 A few years later, in 1893, the \\"Logan scandal\\" caused the Prime Minister at the time, Cecil John Rhodes, to lose much of his parliamentary support. Sprigg made himself available to Rhodes for a cabinet position and in the power vacuum he successfully re-secured the position of treasurer. Sprigg went on to become one of the most vocal and loyal of Rhodes's supporters. When the Jameson Raid forced Rhodes to resign in 1896, Sprigg was once again the best stop-gap candidate for Premier. In 1897 he traveled to London to attend Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, where a brief controversy ensued. He publicly offered a cruiser to the British Navy, on behalf of the Cape, and received an honorary LLD from Edinburgh and an honorary DCL from Oxford. However, upon his return, he was forced to withdraw his promise to the Admiralty, which had not been authorised by parliament. The major theme of his third ministry was his increasing disagreement with the powerful Afrikaner Bond party, caused partly by his continued political assistance to Rhodes. In early 1898 he attempted to restructure the electoral system to as to favour the more British towns over the more Afrikaans rural areas, but his \\"redistribution bill\\" was defeated. He then lost a vote of no confidence that was initiated by William Philip Schreiner in May 1898, but fought to keep his position through the resultant general election, which he lost after an acrimonious campaign; his ministry finally fell to a second motion of no confidence later in the year. Schreiner succeeded him as Premier, just in time to bear the brunt of the crisis of the Second Anglo-Boer War. =Fourth Ministry (1900‚Äì1904)= Schreiner was forced to resign in June 1900 because of his anti-war stance, and Sprigg, who was seen in London as an acceptably pro-imperialist candidate, was appointed prime minister for the fourth and last time, though still without parliamentary sanction. However he was now officially representing a political party, the Progressives, which followed pro-British, pro-Imperialist policies. Sprigg's final ministry coincided with the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902), during which the supplying of the army in the field caused a massive artificial inflation of trade in Southern Africa. This, together with his policy of heavy expenditure, severely damaged the finances of the Cape Colony.Giliomee, H. The Afrikaners: Biography of a people. C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 2003. p.267. However, in his final term in office, Sprigg distinguished himself more than anything else through his work on the suspension issue. He had begun his fourth term by closely toeing the line of the Colonial Office in London, but this became increasingly difficult, as it brought him into conflict with the largest parties in the Cape parliament. His refusal to launch an inquiry into the harsh sentences passed during martial law lost him further support, which he needed if he was to appease the Colonial Office, but he finally took a stand when Alfred Milner ordered him to suspend the Cape constitution, supposedly as a preparation for a future confederation. Sprigg strongly supported confederation, as he had since his first Ministry, but he hesitated on the issue of suspending the country's constitution. However, after Rhodes died in 1902, he immediately declared his resolute opposition to the suspension proposal, speaking against it in London and arguably doing more than anyone else to protect the Cape's constitution and to defeat Milner's proposal. Meanwhile, the delicate balancing act that Sprigg needed to perform in order to survive politically became ever more precarious, until a string of defeats in parliament and in the 1904 election toppled his government for the final time. However, his work against suspension came later to be regarded as his greatest deed as a statesman and his strongest claim to political recognition. Although Sprigg served as prime minister four times‚Äî from 1878 to 1881, 1886 to 1890, 1896 to 1898 and 1900 to 1904‚Äîhe was always appointed by the British governor, never elected democratically. He was appointed as a Privy Counsellor of the United Kingdom in 1897. The Dictionary of South African Biography (Vol.II) described him thus: \\"Small, determined and conceited, Sprigg well deserved Merriman's appellation of \\"The little Master\\". He coveted power and clung to it tenaciously, being content to change his colleagues, as long as he was left undisturbed in office. Moreover, his tremendous patience and mastery of parliamentary procedure gave him great advantages over more inspired but less diligent politicians. On the whole, he was a man of integrity and has a strong claim to be placed high in the ranks of South African statesmen.\\"D. W. Kruger:Dictionary of South African Biography. Vol II. Human Sciences Research Council, Pretoria. Tafelberg Ltd, 1972. . p.700 Later life Sprigg retired from politics after 1904, although he reappeared briefly in 1908 and voted against a parliamentary colour bar in 1909. In his later life he received an impressive array of awards and honours for his work in serving British rule in South Africa, such as and GCMG, as well as honorary doctorates from the University of Oxford and the University of Edinburgh (LL.D., July 1902). He died at his home in Wynberg, Cape Town on 4 February 1913, and was buried at St. Peter's Cemetery, Mowbray. Gordonia in the Northern Cape was named in his honour. Family Sprigg married, in 1862, Ellen Fleischer. They had three daughters and a son, Captain William Porter Sprigg, Cape Colonial Forces.

History Karakamia was originally purchased by Martin Copley in 1991 and established as a sanctuary in 1992, effectively the founding property of the AWC. Since the initial purchase it has increased in size through the acquisition of adjacent private land. Although much of the property was never cleared, some areas had been cleared or selectively logged and a replanting program is being implemented. Landscape and climate Karakamia is on a lateritic plateau dissected by winter-flowing streams. The climate is Mediterranean with winter rainfall and dry summers. Average annual rainfall is 850 mm. A numbat, one of the species found in Karakamia Fauna Karakamia is managed to exclude exotic predators and herbivores, and a vermin-proof fence now surrounds the property. Various native mammals that would have occurred there in the past have been successfully reintroduced. These include the woylie, quenda, tammar wallaby, quokka, numbat and western ringtail possum.

Biography He studied first at the Royal Academy in Munich under Robert von Langer, remaining in that city from 1815 to 1823. Among his productions there were two idyllic works, a \\"Saint Sebastian\\" and a \\"Madonna and Child\\", altar-piece for his native town. In 1823 the painter went to Rome, where he remained until 1826, studying especially the works of Raphael. He became successful as a fresco painter, and, on his return to W√ºrttemberg, the king made him court painter and commissioned him to decorate the Royal Villa of Schloss Rosenstein. In 1829 Gegenbaur went again to Rome and worked on frescoes. During later residence in Stuttgart he was employed from 1836 to 1854 in decorating the royal Palace with sixteen scenes in fresco from the history of W√ºrttemberg. These include incidents in the life of Count Eberhard II of W√ºrttemberg. In the same building are many of his oil paintings, among them being \\"Two Shepherds\\", \\"Adam and Eve after their expulsion from Eden\\", and \\"Moses Striking the Rock\\". In the Stuttgart Gallery is also his \\"Hercules and Omphale\\".

History The project began initially with the aim of performing a show in the defunct Ballroom venue in Rio de Janeiro and was started by Berna Ceppas, Kassin and Seu Jorge. With time, new members such as Nina Becker joined the Orquestra after first performing live with them. The bands repertoire consisted of classic samba tunes and unusual covers such as Vem Fazer Glu-glu originally sung by the presenter Sergio Mallandro, and Owner of a Lonely Heart by English progressive rock group Yes. They also played unknown compositions like Artista √© o Caralho by Rubinho Jacobina and Gomalina, by Max Sete. They occasionally invited guests on stage and these have included Ed Motta, Marcelo Camelo, Fernanda Abreu, Andreas Kisser, Elza Soares amongst others. One of the causes of Orquestra Imperial‚Äôs success was the presence of Rodrigo Amarante, guitarist and vocalist of the rock band Los Hermanos, who introduced fans of his band to the Orquestra and helped to popularise the Orquestra on the alternative scene. 2006 In 2006 the band recorded an EP consisting of three recordings and an instrumental track: Me Deixa Em Paz, Obsess√£o, Popcorn and Sem Compromisso. In the same year their first album Carnaval S√≥ Ano Que Vem, was recorded and distributed by the Brazilian label Som Livre. In 2006, they became known in the international scene, appearing in Portugal at the Festival do Sudoeste, and their first US tour playing venues such as Montclair State University, in New Jersey and Chicago‚Äôs Millennium Park. In February 2006 they also participated alongside Caetano Veloso and other Brazilian acts at the Tropicalismo festival to celebrate the Tropic√°lia movement in 1960s Brazil. 2007 Carnaval S√≥ No Ano Que Vem was released internationally on 8 October by Totolo.

Like its better-known neighbour, Oatlands, the main road of Jericho contains many fine examples of early colonial sandstone architecture, and constructions including examples of convict cut culverts, bridges and walls, many of which date from the 1830s. The main Anglican church, St James (built in 1888) contains the grave of Trooper John Hutton Bisdee, who was the first Tasmanian to be awarded the Victoria Cross. The most notable buildings in Jericho are the Commandant's Cottage (built in 1842) and the Probation Station (built in 1840), which was constructed to house the 200 convicts who were used to construct the road linking Hobart and Launceston. The land adjacent to the station was originally known as ‚ÄòFourteen Tree Plain‚Äô and was the site of the second horse race in the colony of Van Diemens Land, held in April 1826, the first being at \\"Orielton Park\\" owned by Edward Lord on 5 October 1816 according to \\"The Hobart Town Gazette and Southern Reporter\\" of that date.
