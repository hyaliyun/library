History The street runs inside the York city walls, and its name is presumed to refer to the walls of Roman Eboracum, which followed a similar line. The street was first recorded in the 1180s. The 10th-century church of St Helen-on-the-Walls was constructed just off the street, on what became known as St Helen's Lane, but this was demolished in the 1580s. The Merchant Taylors' Hall was built on the street in about 1415, and in the 17th- and early 18th-centuries, it was regarded as a desirable area, with several large houses constructed. The first Wesleyan Methodist chapel in the city was built at 40-42 Aldwark in 1759, and in 1892, the city's first synagogue since the resettlement of the Jews in England opened at 9 Aldwark. However, by the 19th-century, the street was run down, with many houses on the north-east side demolished for the construction of the Ebor Brewery, and various other industrial buildings being constructed. The brewery closed in 1956, and most of the other industrial buildings were demolished in the 1970s and 1980s. Their sites have been redeveloped with modern housing from the 1970s onwards, as part of an effort to encourage more people to live in the city centre. York City Council now describe the street as \\"a pleasant place to live and surprisingly quiet during the day considering it is so close to the bustling city centre\\". Layout and architecture The walls of Saltmarsh House The street runs south-east, from its junction with Goodramgate and Ogleforth, to its junction with St Saviour's Place, Stonebow, and Peaseholm Green. St Andrewgate and the small Bollan Court lead off its south-west side, while the modern streets of Margaret Philipson Court, Hunt Court, and Pear Tree Court, lead off its north-east side. Notable buildings on the north-east side include the Merchant Taylor's Hall and its associated cottage; and the side of St Anthony's Hall; 1-5 Aldwark, built in 1770; the Oliver Sheldon House, with 15th-century origins, but largely rebuilt in 1720; and the gate piers and wall of Saltmarsh House, built in 1693, although the house itself was demolished in 1848. On the south-west side, notable buildings include the former tannery at 36 Aldwark.

In the 20th minute there was a five-minute interval for the nursing of goalkeeper Jean- Paul Laufenburger after a collision with Schneeberger, whereupon Basel's keeper had to be carried away with a concussion. Iff was substituted in and Basel were 0‚Äì1 down at this time. Iff kept a clean sheet and Basel managed a 1‚Äì1 draw. In his one season with the first team, Iff played a total of five games for Basel. Only one of these games were in the Nationalliga A and the others were friendly games.

It is believed to have originated in the United States. Media In 1959, Geoffrey Warren of the Los Angeles Times wrote that a theatrical presentation of The Shrike was \\"as exciting as watching paint dry\\". In 1969, sports announcer Red Barber warned that, due to the dominance of pitchers over batters, baseball at that time was \\"as exciting as watching paint dry.\\" The expression was well known by the late 20th century and has led to real-life activities. In 2012, the World Watching Paint Dry championships were held by online trade merchants localtraders.com to promote various brands of paint. Entries were received from all over the world.; In 2016, director Charlie Lyne released a 10-hour-and-7-minute-long film of paint drying titled Paint Drying to antagonise the British Board of Film Classification as a protest against their censorship and steep fees. The board was forced to watch all of it in order to award it a U certificate. Mike Gapes, MP for Ilford South, complained in 2017 that the parliamentary debate for the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill was sometimes \\"like watching paint dry\\". In 2018, the artist Arvid Boecker exhibited his work Watching Paint Dry at the Kunstverein Brackenheim, Brackenheim, Germany. The television station HGTV was criticised in 2020 for featuring coverage of people watching paint dry as interludes between segments on renovation shows such as Home Town and Fixer Upper. Science Observing the process of paint drying has been found to be important in the development of modern environmentally friendly wall covering material, replacing earlier solvent-derived paints and coatings. The drying process is observed in order to better understand how aqueous material dries on a wall and forms a protective layer. This is particularly important for the marine and shipbuilding industry, to demonstrate the feasibility of new materials on ships. Charles Tomlinson delivered a lecture on the \\"Drying Properties of Various Kinds of House Paint\\" to the Royal Society of Arts in 1869, concluding that paint dries due to the absorption of oxygen and thus solidifies as a result. In 2008, a lecture titled \\"Why Watching Paint Dry Is Interesting\\" published by the Royal Society of Chemistry presented the chemistry and technology used in various marine paints. In 2016, scientists at the University of Surrey and the Universit√© Claude Bernard set up a computer simulation of paint drying, showing that it forms into two layers spontaneously as small particles in the paint combine and push away larger ones. This could lead to improved performance of future coatings.

He was dispatched to Bhutan by the Japanese Government to help modernise the Bhutanese agricultural sector. Nishioka worked in Bhutan as an agriculture expert for 28 years until his death in 1992. Biography =Early life= Keiji Nishioka was born to Tatsuzo Nishioka and Toshie Nishioka in Seoul on 14 February 1933. He was the oldest of four children. In Seoul, then called Keijou, he attended Sakuragaoka Primary School. The family moved to Osaka after the Japanese defeat in the Second World War and the subsequent decolonisation of Korea. In Osaka, Nishioka studied in Yao Junior High School. In 1952, Nishioka entered the Osaka Prefecture University to study agriculture. He married Satoko Nikai in 1959. =Life in Bhutan= In 1958, Sasuke Nakao, one of Nishioka's professors at the University in Osaka, went to Bhutan as the first official visitor from Japan. The Prime Minister (Lyonchhen) of Bhutan at the time, Jigme Palden Dorji, asked Nakao for an agricultural expert to help Bhutan modernise its agricultural sector. The lack of developed bilateral relations between Japan and Bhutan at this time prevented any plans from materialising. However, this problem was solved when Bhutan joined the Colombo Plan in 1962 and thus became entitled to receive aid from other member states in the Plan. On Nakao's recommendation, Nishioka, now an agricultural expert with the Japanese Overseas Technical Cooperation Agency, went to Bhutan in July 1964. Paro In 1966, Nishioka, along with three apprentices, established an experimental farm, called the Bondey Farm, in Paro. In this farm, Nishioka grew rice and vegetables such as peas, radishes, pumpkins and cabbages from seeds he had brought from Japan. The farm was successful, growing in size and profitability. Nishioka's contributions helped improve paddy cultivation and the use of greenhouses. He also encouraged farmers to sell their food in the open market, including in places outside Paro like Thimphu and Phuntsholing. Zhemgang Nishioka, along with ten apprentices from the Bondey Farm, went to Panbang in the lower Kheng region of Zhemgang Dzongkhag in March 1976, as a part of an Integrated Development project for Zhemgang. The natives of this region mostly practised shifting cultivation in the forests, with no permanent settlements. Nishioka worked to make the region more developed. He ordered the clearing of forests and the settlement of the shifting cultivators in villages in the cleared areas. The region around what is today Sonamthang village was converted from forest to 146 acres of cultivated wetland with fields of paddy on Nishioka's orders. At the end of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, 65 households whose members had contributed to the clearing and cultivation of the region were awarded land there, creating Sonamthang village. Other villages resulting from similar processes include Thinleygang, Laling, Marangduth, Tunkudema and Pantang. Nishioka also introduced the cultivation of agarwood and cardamom trees for use as cash crops. Nishioka's efforts led to an increase in the standards of living of people in Zhemgang, improving communities' self-sufficiency in foodgrains. Nishioka was also active in the field of infrastructure development in Zhemgang. He oversaw the building of 17 suspension bridges and mobilised people's participation in the construction of canals, roads and health clinics. =Awards and titles= For his many contributions to Bhutan, Nishioka was conferred the title of Dasho by the Fourth Druk Gyalpo of Bhutan, Jigme Singye Wangchuck in 1980. He was the first foreigner to have received the title Dasho. Later, he was awarded the Druk Thugsey medal, the highest civilian award in Bhutan. =Death= Nishioka died on 21 March 1992 in Thimphu, at the age of 59. He was survived by his wife Satoko and two children. He was given a state funeral on 26 March. =Legacy and commemoration= Nishioka is remembered as the 'father of modern agriculture' in Bhutan. In Panbang, he is remembered as 'Japan sahib' among the elderly. A suspension bridge in Panbang is named after Nishioka; it is known as the Nishioka Zam. In June 2014, on the completion of fifty years' cooperation between Japan and Bhutan, a museum was inaugurated in Paro in Nishioka's memory.

The genus Clathria is subdivided into a number of subgenera, and it is in the subgenus Microciona. It is native to shallow water habitats in the Indo- Pacific region. The type locality is the Gulf of Thailand. Description Clathria aceratoobtusa is an encrusting sponge forming patches thick. The oscula (exhalent pores) are up to in diameter and appear to have membranous lips. They are either flush with the smooth surface or slightly raised. The inhalant pores are tiny and scattered over the surface, giving a net-like effect. The texture is firm and the living sponge is a bright orange-red colour. Distribution Clathria aceratoobtusa occurs in the tropical Indo- Pacific region, its range including Myanmar, Malaysia,Thailand, the Philippines, Micronesia and northern Australia. In the 21st century, it has appeared for the first time in Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park in southern India, where it is causing concern by its invasiveness. At this site it occurs at depths down to about .  Ecology  Coral reefs in tropical seas are biodiverse communities where corals, sponges, coralline algae, seaweeds and other organisms compete for space and nutrients. Clathria aceratoobtusa is an encrusting sponge found on reefs growing over the surface of rocks, bivalve molluscs, shell debris, coral colonies and worm tubes. It grows over the surface of corals at the rate of about per month, smothering them; a thin white line of dead tissue separates the healthy coral tissues from the advancing sponge. In India, where this sponge is a non-native, invasive species, the corals most affected by it are Porites, Acropora, Montipora, Favia and especially Turbinaria, which appears to be its favoured substrate. The sponge cannot easily be separated from the coral because it penetrates into the tissues. The corals in the Gulf of Mannar have a tendency to bleach and the sponge may be thriving there because of the corals' weakened state. In Yemen, where the sponge has also expanded its range, the coral most affected is Porites lutea.

Gutman that addresses the impact of slavery on black families. It is based on research that Gutman conducted over the course of the decade since the Moynihan Report, which revived the \\"tangle of pathology\\" thesis; the claim that black families in the US were incapable of functioning in a healthy way, a rationale previously rejected by critics as racist.Patterson, Freedom Is Not Enough: The Moynihan Report and America's Struggle Over Black Family Life From LBJ to Obama (2010).New York Times: The Black Family in Slavery And Freedom, 1750‚Äê1925; Were black families split and demoralized by slavery? No, says a new and crucial study The book draws on census data, diaries, family records, bills of sale and other records. Gutman says that if slavery destroyed the family as white politician Daniel Patrick Moynihan claimed, then family structure statistics should have been worse closer to the time of slavery. He then lays out statistics showing that black families actually had higher legitimacy rates than whites for the first several decades after the end of the Civil War, along with comparable success in various other metrics.Jason Riley On ‚ÄúFalse Black Power?‚Äù Gutman concludes that black families, rather than having been irretrievably destroyed by slavery, showed great power and resilience, pulling together as slavery ended, with more two-parent households and couples who stayed together longer.How Slavery Affected African American Families He says that black families also remained intact during the first wave of migration to the North after the Civil War (although he remained open to arguments about black family collapse in the 1930s and 1940s).William Serrin, \\"Prof. Herbert Gutman, Labor Historian, Is Dead,\\" New York Times, July 22, 1985, p.

It was painted in the first quarter of the 17th century, and is currently housed at the Museum of Prado in Madrid. Painting This landscape painting depicts Archduchess Isabel Clara Eugenia in the fields of her summer residence in Mariemont, close by Brussels. Isabella's opulent palace is visible in the upper right corner. Isabel Clara Eugenia with fields and palace in the background, by Jan Brueghel and Rubens In the foreground, there are several people raking up hay, loading it onto a cart. The painting portraits people engaged in common activities typical of the country. However, the workers in the painting are in fact members of the court. Among them, there is Isabel. The oeuvre is an allegory for the enjoyment of the life/ time spent in the country. Isabel's love and enthusiasm for the life in the country is evinced in her correspondence with the Duke of Lerma. For example. in a letter she wrote on October 20, 1606, the archduchess says: \\"[A] todos nos da la vida el exercicio y el andar al campo.\\" In another letter, dating to May 29, 1609, she writes: \\"[N]os hemos venido a esta casilla a gozar del campo, que esta lind√≠simo [...]. En fin, la vida en el campo es la mejor de todas.\\" The painting is considered a collaboration between Joos de Momper and Jan Brueghel the Elder. The latter reportedly painted the figures, the former the landscape. The painting was part of a group of twenty-six paintings which reached Madrid from Flanders in the early 17th century. The paintings were to decorate the Torre de la Reina in the Alc√°zar de Madrid. The Excursion in the countryside of Infanta Isabel Clara Eugenia is first mentioned in an inventory of the Alc√°zar dating to 1636.

She was a leader in the Communist Party of Venezuela, serving on as a member of the central committee and political bureau on several occasions throughout her 80 years of involvement in the party.Linarez, Elena (October 2016). \\"Olga y la lucha por los derechos de la mujer\\". Tribuna Popular.  Early life  Olga Luzardo was born in Paraguaipoa in Venezuela's Zulia state in 1916, although some sources have reported her birth year as 1918. Her parents were Aramis Luzardo y Margarita Finol. At age 12, she became part of the first Marxist circles in Maracaibo's Baralt and Urdaneta plazas. Through the poet and educator Jes√∫s Enrique Lossada, she was introduced to the works of Karl Marx, Maxim Gorky, Friedrich Engels, Nikolai Bukharin, and Vladimir Lenin. Her early activism included helping to form and organize the first unions of tram and oil workers in Maracaibo, when she was only 13 years old. She also joined the fight for women's rights in 1928, protesting mistreatment and workplace discrimination.  Activism  Luzardo was a member of the Patriotic Women's Society, an organization of women that protested and fought against the dictatorship of Juan Vicente G√≥mez. In 1931, along with Gabriel Bracho, Espartaco Gonz√°lez, Isidro Valles, and others, she helped form the first cells of the Communist Party of Venezuela in the state of Zulia. After G√≥mez's death in 1935, Luzardo began working to organize political groups among the oil workers. In 1936, she participated in the First Feminist Congress in Caracas, alongside Eumelia Hern√°ndez, Itala Reyes, Auxiliadora Soto, Margoth D√≠az Urdaneta, Rosa Virginia Mart√≠nez, and other female activists fighting for women's suffrage. Later that year, she was one of the main organizers of the First Great Venezuelan Oil Strike. In 1936, Luzardo founded the Agrupaci√≥n Cultural Femenina, the Communist Party's first women's organization, which worked for international solidarity and equal political, social, and cultural rights for women. She remained deeply involved in the party, working on its central committee and to disseminate party materials across the country. She was a founder of the Women's International Democratic Federation in the 1940s, serving as Venezuela's first delegate to the organization and traveling to represent the country in the Soviet Union, Chile, Cuba, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries. She received a degree in economics from the Central University of Venezuela in 1944. The following year, one of her primary fights came to fruition: Venezuelan women won the right to vote. During the dictatorship of Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez, Luzardo was a founder and activist for the Uni√≥n de Muchachas Venezolanas (Union of Venezuelan Women), and she was a member of the resistance, operating under the pseudonym \\"Jorge.\\" During this period, particularly in the 1950s, she was targeted with repression and mistreatment by the authorities: She was shot in the leg and later thrown in prison. After serving time in the San Carlos penitentiary in Cojedes state, in 1952 she was exiled to Mexico and the USSR. She returned to Caracas after the Jim√©nez dictatorship's fall in 1958. On her return to Venezuela, she rejoined the resistance, now against the democratically elected presidencies of R√≥mulo Betancourt and Ra√∫l Leoni, via the Armed Forces of National Liberation, a guerrilla group. Through the group, known as FALN, she led a high-profile train raid known as \\"Operation Olga Luzardo\\" in 1963.  Writing  Luzardo's early activism was paired with an early entry into the literary sphere. As a young woman, she worked with the poets Ely Sa√∫l Rodr√≠guez and Rosa Virginia Mart√≠nez, as well as the painter Antonio Angulo, to form an athenaeum in Maracaibo. She had a long career as a journalist, publishing her first opinion articles in the Maracaibo newspaper Panorama in the 1930s. She worked for the daily newspaper √öltimas Noticias alongside Ana Luisa Llovera, considered the first female Venezuelan reporter, as well as Mar√≠a Teresa Castillo. She also wrote for Ahora and helped found Tribuna Popular, the Communist Party's press organ.\\"Ch√°vez Delata y Entrega Revolucionarios a Gobiernos Fascistas\\". radioteca.net. Archived from the original on February 19, 2017. She sometimes wrote under the pseudonym \\"Petrovna.\\" Luzardo also wrote poetry, first publishing the collection Flor de cactus in 1942. The book collects poems written between 1935 and 1942, which mix political elements with romantic and erotic ones. A collection of poems written during her incarceration from 1950 and 1952 was published in 1993 under the title Huellas frescas.  Personal life and legacy  Her only daughter, with the fellow revolutionary Luis Eduardo P√©rez Arteaga, was born in 1939. In 2016, Luzardo was given the Order of the Liberators Medal First Class by President Nicol√°s Maduro. She died later that year in Caracas, at age 100.

McCluskey wrote the famous Land O'Lakes Statement, as a member of the committee headed by Fr. Theodore Hesburgh. McCluskey was also the last surviving nephew of Blessed Solanus Casey.  Early Life  Blessed Solanus Casey, McCluskey's uncle McCluskey was born and raised in Seattle, Washington and attended O'Dea High School. McCluskey's mother, Mary Genevieve Casey McCluskey was the younger sister of Blessed Solanus Casey. A Gonzaga alumnus, Neil McCluskey earned a bachelor's degree in English and Philosophy and a master's degree in Philosophy from the University in 1944 and 1945, respectively, and was ordained a priest of the Society of Jesus in 1938. He earned a licentiate in sacred theology from the Alma College, now the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley, in 1952.  Career in Education  In 1955, McCluskey moved to New York City and became an associate editor for America Magazine, the prominent Jesuit Catholic weekly journal, way he would stay until 1960. While working at America, McCluskey earned his Ph.D. in social history in 1957, studying at Columbia Graduate School of Philosophy and Teachers College. It was also in New York City where he wrote his first few books on Catholic Education. In 1960, McCluskey returned to his alma mater as an education professor. In his time at Gonzaga, he would be named Dean of the School of Education, and later Academic Vice President of Gonzaga. McCluskey also helped develop Gonzaga‚Äôs Honors Program and created the Gonzaga in Florence study abroad program. At Gonzaga, McCluskey continued writing books on Catholic education. In 1966, Father Theodore Hesburgh brought Father McCluskey to the University of Notre Dame as a Visiting Professor of Education. McCluskey was then promoted to Dean-Director of the Notre Dame Institute for Studies in Education and founded the Notre Dame Journal of Education. While at Notre Dame, McCluskey became a member of the Religious Education Association Board of Directors where he would serve for 23 years. As a Jesuit education at Notre Dame, a Holy Cross institution, McCluskey played a key role as intermediary between Notre Dame and the prominent Jesuit universities around the country who had had a contentious relationship for many years. The most influential of McCluskey‚Äôs writings came in 1967 when McCluskey, at the request of Notre Dame president Father Hesburgh, helped plan the meetings for the International Federation of Catholic Universities. These meetings would culminate with the statement, written by McCluskey, entitled ‚ÄúThe Nature of the Contemporary Catholic University,‚Äù better known as ‚ÄúThe Land O‚ÄôLakes Statement.‚Äù The seminar, on the role of Catholic universities, sponsored by University of Notre Dame and hosted at Notre Dame's Land O'Lakes property, was attended by the presidents of the University of Notre Dame, Georgetown, Seton Hall, Boston College, Fordham, St. Louis University, and the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico. Over a dozen other educators from North American Catholic institutions of higher education were also present. McCluskey would subsequently be named chair of the IFCU meeting at the Lovanium University at Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which would release ‚ÄúThe Kinshasa Statement on the Catholic University in the Modern World of the IFCU,‚Äù as well as the Congress of Catholic Universities' ‚ÄúThe Rome Statement on the Catholic University and the Aggiornamento.‚Äù While at Notre Dame, McCluskey was also a member of the Board of Trustees at the neighboring Saint Mary's College. At the time the University of Notre Dame was preparing to start co-education and McCluskey was tasked with handling the merger of Saint Mary‚Äôs College and Notre Dame. The negotiations for the merger were ended, the merger never occurred, and McCluskey resigned his position on the Board of Trustees.  Later Life  After leaving Notre Dame, McCluskey moved back to New York City. In 1975, he left the priesthood and got married. He would spend much of the rest of his life teaching and writing about aging and Gerontological Studies. McCluskey died in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on May 27, 2008.

The film is hand-coloured and presented in two sections, with a total running time of 49 minutes 50 seconds. Background The creator of ‚ÄúHeldenkampf in Schnee und Eis‚Äù remains unknown, but it may have been the work of the cameraman and later director Gustav Ucicky. At that time, film was still a very new form of propaganda. Ein Heldenkampf in Schnee und Eis consists of exterior shots on the Alpine front in Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol, where battles were being fought in the mountains at 2,000 to 3,000 meters. These offered an opportunity for each side to portray its soldiers as heroes, the fight in snow and ice demonstrating strength and superiority over the enemy and allowing each side to emphasise the effectiveness of its own weapons and warfare. A silent film, it had title cards between shots as was normal, but was presented without musical accompaniment in the cinema, which as unusual. Action =Scenes in section one= # Early morning on the glacier, a patrol in the ice # Movement observed in the enemy lines. A patrol marches out # Across the walls of snow # Reconnaissance patrols are also at work in the other sections of the front # Climbing a 3,500m high Firn overlooking the enemy positions # Any advances by the enemy must be thwarted. The section commander takes the cable car to the forward bases # Express train speed through an station of the glacier railway # The troops, exhausted after several months of service, are replaced by fresh units # Laborious ascent after long marches # The detached troops descend from the glacier to the rest and recovery stations # Artillery is prepared. A mountain cannon is transported over the steep glacier # The gun is mounted # Enemy columns in sight. Alarm at the highest heavy artillery on our Alpine front. # # The war in the glacier. Ice crevices and crevices through which the enemy can advance are occupied and expanded by our troops # High alpine equipment is carried on the cableway. # Before attacking the enemy base, a mountain guide patrol clears the difficult terrain # Arctic fortresses: Austro-Hungarian military camps in mountain heights that humans have so far not been able to colonize. =Scenes in section two= # Attack on the enemy base 'Height 3274' # The day before the attack. A trench in our glacier positions raked by enemy fire # With the infantry observer: View of the enemy Base 'H√∂he 3274' # Early in the morning of the day of the attack: The troops lying in reserve are alerted # A rapid firing gun is brought forward to an improvised firing position # The attackers approach Their positions # The gun is aligned # The section commander, who directs the attack # The order to fire. The brief but devastating artillery preparation for the attack begins. # Height 3274 under fire. The attack force advances # The attack force heads towards the enemy position # At attacking distance # To make it impossible for the enemy reserves to come forward, the target zone of artillery fire is moved back #Attack! Under fire from the surviving defenders, the attackers break into the enemy base over difficult rocks # The height has been taken. The section commander receives the report # The wounded and prisoners are transported away # On the conquered ridge: View of the firns and rocks of the main enemy positions # Report on the mountain battle of Austrian soldiers on the southern front against Italy in the First World War The soldiers' thirst for action can be seen from the last text overlay. An enemy base has only just been stormed, and you can already look into the distance at the firns and peaks, where the main enemy positions are. Like the beginning of the film, the last shot is a mountain shot. Criticism The distinction between fiction and documentary film was still unclear at the time the film was made, and it was common to take multiple images and cut them in quick succession. The film departed from the normal rules of the war press headquarters. It obviously shows the exhausted, unmotivated faces of the fighters, the endless expanses of the mountains and impassible snow. It did not seek to contribute to strengthening the nation's self-confidence as an ordinary propaganda film might, but showed the limits of strength and endurance. The film included scenes apparently shot from behind both Austrian and Italian lines, including some identifiable as having been shown before, so did not consist of entirely new and documentary camerawork. It included some scenes previously shown in Beim Johannesfall in den Radst√§tter Tauern (1917) made by the same studio.

Life  Virginie Traut was born on 18 October 1814 in Colmar, France. On 7 April 1849, she married Jean Griess, a travelling salesman who shared her interest in phalansterian social organisation (inspired by Fourierist principles of self-sufficiency and cooperation.). Both took the name Griess-Traut. In the same, the couple left France for Algeria, where they remained for twenty-five years. Settling in Algiers, they formed a community with likeminded individuals, setting up a bakery, grocery store, and establishing a Froebelian kindergarten. At the outset of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, Griess-Traut took to the press to call on her fellow women to join together in denouncing the war, initiating lifelong involvement with pacifist activism. Over the following decades, Griess-Traut was active in numerous pacifist organisations, including the International League for Peace Freedom, French Society for Arbitration, Society of Peace, and the Association of Women for Peace. She was vice- president of the Society for Peace through Education and an advocate of the idea that 'European forces be made over into groups for public works development', transforming the standing armies of Europe into 'productive organisations'. In the mid-1870s, Griess-Traut and her husband returned to Europe, living first in Switzerland and then in France. In 1877, Griess-Traut issued a Manifesto of Women Against War. Jean Griess-Traut died in 1882. In 1889, at the French and International Congress of the Rights of Women in Paris, Griess-Traut spoke in support of co-education. She was also a vice- president of the Congress.  Death and legacy  Griess-Traut died in 1898, and is remembered as being 'a loyal supporter of progressive, republican, feminist, and peace causes during her long life'.

Caddick travelled the world between 1889 and 1914, including a journey in the African interior with a team of hired men to carry her bags and her conveyance. In 1900, she published A White Women in Central Africa, a travel memoir. The Pall Mall Gazette wrote: \\"The author of this very entertaining record of nearly six months' travel may certainly claim to be a pioneer, not in the sense of having visited virgin regions, but as being the first lady who has toured from the Zambesi's mouth to Tanganyika.\\" The review noted that unlike women missionaries, she travelled solo and \\"on no sort of business but pleasure and observation.\\" A local paper wrote in 1900: \\"It will, no doubt, be somewhat of a surprise to many Edgbastonians to learn that they have living in their midst so adventurous a lady as Miss Helen Caddick, who has explored most quarters of the globe, except for those occupied by perpetual snow or polar ice.

Built in 1877 as a residence for military officer and politician Seth Ledyard Phelps, the house served as the Korean legation for the Joseon kingdom followed by the Korean Empire from 1889 to 1905 when Japan took control of Korea's government. The building was sold in 1910 for $10 and later served as a recreation center for African Americans, trade union hall, and private residence. To many Koreans the building was a reminder of Japan's forceful takeover of their country and the Korean loss of sovereignty. Following decades of offers from Koreans, the property was sold by its longtime owners in 2012 to the South Korean government's Cultural Heritage Administration and National Trust for the Cultural Heritage of the Republic of Korea. After undergoing a multi-year, multi-million dollar renovation, the Old Korean Legation Museum was opened in 2018. The Victorian style museum, which features a library, banquet hall, and small garden, is a contributing property to the Logan Circle Historic District and Greater Fourteenth Street Historic District. History =Original owner= On December 16, 1877, Seth Ledyard Phelps was issued a permit to construct a seven-bedroom home at 15 Iowa Circle, a park and traffic circle in the present-day Logan Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C.. Thomas M. Plowman was selected to design the 6,300 sq ft (585 sq m) brick residence and it was built by Joseph Williams at a cost of $5,500. It was adorned with a tin roof, decorative railing, cast metal porch, and Ohio sandstone, and included a basement and projecting bays. Phelps was a military officer who served in the Navy during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and Civil War, and during his later years was president of the local Board of Commissioners and minister to Peru. Phelps was also a real estate developer and his house at 15 Iowa Circle was one of the first large residences built in the neighborhood. He commissioned nearby buildings, including the houses at 1202 Q Street, 1500-1504 Vermont Avenue, and 1502 13th Street. Following his death in 1885, Phelps' wife, Lizzie, continued residing in their home for the next few years. She and later their daughter, Sally, retained ownership of 1504 Vermont Avenue until 1919. =Korean Legation= In 1888 Park Chung Yang became the first Korean minister to the US following diplomatic contact with President Grover Cleveland. Korea's first legation opened that same year at 1513 O Street NW. At the time, Qing China had direct influence over the Korean government and placed heavy restrictions on Korean foreign policy, including the prohibition of establishing diplomatic missions in the Western world, to keep Korea under its sphere of control. The United States strongly objected to this approach, leading to what would become the only Korean legation in the West being allowed to open. China continued to interfere in the legation's affairs, at one point demanding that the Korean officials not meet other diplomats or engage in diplomatic business, but this was ignored. The following February the government of the Joseon kingdom moved their legation to 15 Iowa Circle. In 1891 the building was purchased by the Korean government from Phelps' son- in-law, Sevellon A. Brown, for $25,000. King Gojong spent what was then a large sum of money to help establish further diplomatic ties with the US. In April 1898 a fire broke out on the third floor of the legation due to a faulty flue. The fire destroyed furniture and books and damaged the walls and woodwork. Neighbors who noticed the fire helped carry documents to a safe location. Minister Chin Pom Ye and his family, who were on the first floor, were unharmed. The Empire of Japan took control of the Korean Empire following the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1905 and made the Korean state a protectorate. The Koreans lost their diplomatic sovereignty and the building on Logan Circle, occupied by Minister Yun Chun Kim, no longer served as a legation. It was made official in January 1906 when Kim made a farewell call to State Department staff. Secretary of State Elihu Root began conducting diplomatic affairs related to Korea through the Japanese legation and the Korean property and records were turned over to the Japanese. Following the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1910, whereby Japan annexed Korea, the building was officially purchased by the Japanese government. The real estate contract stated: \\"The Japanese Legation pays $5 to Joseon's emperor, who shall unconditionally hand over the ownership of the property.\\" It was resold a short while later to an American for only $10, which was viewed as embarrassing and insulting by the Koreans. =Intermediate ownership= During the next several decades the building served as a private residence, a recreation center for African Americans in the 1940s, and a union hall for Teamsters. Following Korea's liberation in World War II Koreans living in the US as well as the Korean government wanted to repurchase the house. Timothy and Lauretta Jenkins bought the home in 1977, during a time when the surrounding area was known as a haven for prostitutes and drug dealers. The house next door, 1502 13th Street, had operated as a brothel until it was shut down in 1976. According to the Jenkins, they were frequently visited by Koreans that wanted to purchase the home: \\"We've lived in the house for almost 35 years, and almost from the beginning Koreans would stop by the house to ask us if we were interested in selling it. Needless to say, we were not.\\" The couple were aware of the building's history but didn't fully appreciate what it meant to Koreans until one day during the 1980s when they noticed a man standing outside their house. Timothy went outside and spoke to the man who turned out to be a former Korean Army general and the grandson of the first minister. The Jenkins gave the man a tour of the house and according to Lauretta \\"he walked around so reverentially that it struck a note with us.\\" The couple continued to receive offers from Koreans but were unwilling to sell and worried the building wouldn't be preserved: \\"Who knows what they would do? Sell it into someone else's hands, break it up into condos ‚Äî we didn't want that to happen.\\" There was a campaign led by a group of Korean Americans to purchase the property in the mid-2000s, but they only managed to raise $80,000. In 2008 officials from the South Korean embassy began negotiations with the Jenkins to purchase the home. According to Korean embassy official Choe Byeong-gu, the couple originally wanted $6 million for the property. The following year the South Korean government allocated 3 billion won ($2.6 million) to purchase the house. In 2012 the South Korean government's Cultural Heritage Administration (CHA) began a campaign to purchase the property and the Jenkins were invited to a dinner with the South Korean ambassador. Soon after the dinner a real estate agency hired by the South Korean government's Cultural Heritage Administration (CHA) agreed to a purchase price with the Jenkins. The property value at the time was $1.65 million and the final selling price was $3.5 million. To many South Koreans the return of the property to their government was seen as a victory for the nation. After the sale was finalized Kim Jong-gyu, chairman of the civic group National Trust for the Cultural Heritage of the Republic of Korea, stated: \\"This is not just a purchase of a building, but a restoration of our national pride deprived by Japan.\\" Kim Chan from CHA said \\"Although we're not able to recover all history stolen from us by Japanese imperialists, this Korean Empire legation building miraculously survived. For us, this is a very meaningful and historic day.\\" The sale occurred when Japan and South Korea were experiencing frosty diplomatic relations due to the Liancourt Rocks dispute and continued anger over compensation and apologies for comfort women Japan abused during World War II. Japanese embassy officials did not comment on the purchase of the former legation. South Korean media outlets reported on the sale and the \\"symbolic righting of a long-standing wrong.\\" A granddaughter of King Gojong, Amy Lee, who had also campaigned for the purchase of the building said \\"I'm glad we have become strong enough and have enough money to buy it back.\\" Museum Following the sale of the building, South Korean government officials announced it would be used a cultural center. An official from CHA said \\"The building will be used as bridgeheads to let the American public learn about our cultural heritage and to teach Koreans a historic lesson.\\" A survey of the property and designs for the new center began in 2013. That same year the building, which is a contributing property to the Logan Circle Historic District and Greater Fourteenth Street Historic District, was included in Logan Circle's heritage trail with a sign in front of the building providing the history of the legation. The trail's unveiling ceremony was attended by South Korean officials including Ambassador Ahn Ho- young. From 2015 to 2018 the property was extensively remodeled and restored to its late 19th-century appearance. The exterior features the original Victorian architectural details and the interior blends these details with Korean decorative pieces. Each room was named as it was from 1889 to 1905, antique furniture was purchased, and the wallpaper and carpets were chosen to reflect the time period. The small parking lot next to the building was turned into a garden featuring flower walls and a granite Eternal Youth Gate (bulomun in Korean). The new layout of the building includes a library, photograph exhibit, the minister's bedroom, private offices, and a banquet area. On May 22, 2018, the South Korean flag was hoisted above the building and the Old Korean Legation Museum was opened. The official opening ceremony took place several days later to coincide with President Moon Jae-in's visit to Washington, D.C. The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10am to 5pm and admission is free. To mark the 70th anniversary of the US military entering the Korean War, a banner was displayed outside the museum as well as the embassy's consular section and cultural center. Along with messages of peace, solidarity, and remembrance, the banner included images of both country's flags and the message \\"Thanks to the U.S.A!\\" Notes :1. Iowa Circle was renamed in 1930 in honor of military officer and politician John A. Logan.

It was Haggard's 21st novel involving his protagonist Colonel Charles Russell, who had been head of the unobtrusive but lethal Security Executive, a government counter-intelligence agency clearly based on the actual MI5 or Security Service, for the first 11 books in the series and then is frequently consulted by his various successors during his retirement. Like most of the other works by Haggard and some by his near contemporaries Victor Canning and Michael Gilbert, it is both a standard novel of suspense and a semi-political thriller about the reactions of those in high government positions who scent potential danger to their own political standing from the on-going events of the novel. Plot Protagonist is perhaps too strong a word to describe Colonel Russell. As Haggard himself wrote about his fiction: > My novels are chiefly novels of suspense with a background of international > politics. A Colonel Charles Russell of the Security Executive, a not > entirely imaginary British counter-espionage organization, while not a > protagonist in the technical sense, holds the story line together in the > background by his operations, while the characters in the foreground carry > the action.\\"From the back flap of the dust jacket of the Walker and Company > American edition of The Conspirators, New York, 1967 This is certainly the case with The Mischief Makers. Written with the spare, dry, and understated style that Haggard had evolved from his earlier more introspective, character-driven novels, it is told through the viewpoints of a number of diverse characters and only infrequently do we see Colonel Russell directly. The elderly Berber president of an unnamed North African country‚Äînot Arab, for he despises Arabs‚Äîhas concocted a hair-brained scheme to avenge a decades-old rape of one of his daughters by a long-since dead Englishman serving in the French Foreign Legion. He entrusts the scheme‚Äîthe instigation of armed and violent race riots by supposedly oppressed blacks in British cities‚Äîto Abdelaziz, one of his numerous sons, who is both an accredited diplomat and the head of the country's secret service. Reluctantly but obediently, Abdel duly smuggles various arms into England via the diplomatic bag while simultaneously seeking to find enough disaffected blacks throughout the country to use in urban uprisings. But the Security Executive is tipped off to the scheme and its present head soon seeks the counsel of Colonel Russell. There are frequent referrals both by Abdel, Colonel Russell, and the other characters in the book, most of whom are working at cross purposes to each other, to the real-life Bristol riot of 1980, which had happened the previous year. The hidden arms are moved, and then moved again. Angry blacks are recruited by various characters to beat and kill other characters. But the Security Executive, and Charles Russell, have their own highly resourceful black, William Wilberforce Smith, as a counter-weapon. Smith, whom Russell, a devout Establishment conservative but far from being a racist, hopes will eventually become head of the Security Executive, sees through several dangerous missions, and Russell and Abdel have a fruitful meeting for the first time in 37 years, not since Russell, a British Army major in Italy during World War II, had saved the youthful Abdel from being summarily executed by an angry French officer. By the end of the book, Abdel has returned to his native land, an uneasy peace reigns in England, and Russell is contentedly sipping brandy while listening to the current head of the Security Executive predict that \\"The rats are going to win in the end.\\"The Mischief Makers, Walker and Company, New York, 1982, page 173 References External links : ","title":"The Mischief Makers (novel)"},{"id":"65401960","title":"Ulster Volkswagen Classic"},{"id":"65402012","text":"Avrohom Chaim Levin (1932November 28, 2018) was a Haredi rabbi, Talmudic scholar, co-founder and co-rosh yeshiva (\\"dean\\") of the Telshe Yeshiva in Chicago.Dei'ah veDibur - Information & Insight - NEWS Articles about his life can be found https://www.amimagazine.org/2018/12/05/in-tribute-to-rav-avrohom- chaim-levin-ztl/ and https://hamodia.com/2018/11/28/hagoan-harav-avrohom- chaim-levin-ztl/ References Category:1932 births Category:2018 deaths ","title":"Avrohom Chaim Levin"},{"id":"65402032","text":"The Married Philosopher is a 1732 comedy play by the writer John Kelly.

Life and death  Elleine Smith was living in Maldon, Essex, when she was accused, tried, and sentenced to death for witchcraft in 1579. She had at least two children, a son and a daughter. Smith, whose mother had also been executed for supposed 'murder by witchcraft', was accused of killing a child, and suspected of causing the death of her stepfather, who she had recently argued with. She was also said to have attacked a neighbour with a toad spirit. Among Smith's accusers, as was frequent in witch trials at the time, was her own son. He claimed that Smith 'kept three spirits': 'Great Dick in a wicker bottle, Little Dick in a leathern bottle, and Willet in a wool- pack.' One of the incidents over which she was accused, was bewitching her neighbour, John Estwood, for refusing alms to her son. In retaliation, it was alleged, she caused Estwood to have 'very greate paine in his bodie'. The case of Elleine Smith is described in A Detection of Damnable Driftes, Practized by Three Witches Arrainged at Chelmifforde [Chelmsford] in Essex, at the Late Assizes There Holden, Which Were Executed in Aprill, 1579, held by the British Library. An introduction to the anonymously authored pamphlet warns readers of the dangers of Satan, and advocates prayer as a means of protection. Smith was hanged in Chelmsford in April 1579.

Early life After attending elementary school and high school, Haase studied medicine at the University of G√∂ttingen. In G√∂ttingen in 1921 he served as the local Chairman of the Deutschv√∂lkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund, the largest, most active, and most influential anti-Semitic federation in Germany. In February 1922 he joined the Nazi Party and founded the first Ortsgruppe (local group) in G√∂ttingen, becoming the Ortsgruppenleiter. Haase was personally devoted to Adolf Hitler, who was imprisoned at Landsberg prison in 1924 as a consequence of the Beer Hall Putsch. Haase had a continuous connection to Hitler through Haase's friend, Hermann Fobke, a member of the Sto√ütrupp-Hitler, who was also imprisoned in Landsberg. While the Party was outlawed, Haase carried on activities as Bezirksleiter (Regional Leader) of the Hanover National Socialist Landesverband (State Association) a Nazi-front organization. Nazi career After the ban on the Party was lifted, Haase rejoined it on 6 March 1925 (membership number 2,827). On 27 March 1925, Haase was appointed the Gauleiter for Gau G√∂ttingen. This was composed of the southern section of the Province of Hanover known as Regierungsbezirk (Governmental District) Hildesheim. Hermann Fobke was named Deputy Gauleiter. In December, the organization was redesignated Gau Hanover-South. Under Haase's leadership, according to the historian Hans-J√ºrgen D√∂scher, ‚Äúthe Hanover and G√∂ttingen local groups developed into the most active and largest bases of the National Socialists in Lower Saxony‚Äù. Haase suffered a head injury in an altercation with political opponents in 1927 and resigned as Gauleiter on 20 July 1928. Gau Hanover-South was merged with neighboring Gau Hanover-North under Bernhard Rust on 1 October, and was renamed Gau Southern Hanover-Brunswick. In February 1943, Haase took a position as a personal assistant to the State Secretary and SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Herbert Backe in the Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture.

At the start of the 18th century, it was claimed to be serving as both a stable and a brothel. From about 1730, it was St Peter's School, and then from 1823 it was the infant section of the school. By this time, the chancel was a ruin, but by 1850 it was rebuilt as a cottage.

Zoraida D√≠az Chamize (March 1881 ‚Äì June 14, 1948), better known as Zoraida D√≠az de Schtronn, was a Panamanian poet and educator. She is considered the first woman to publish a book of poetry in Panama.  Biography  D√≠az was born in 1881 in Las Tablas in what was then the Department of Panama, although her birth year is sometimes given as 1880. She was the daughter of Francisco D√≠az Medina and Carolina Chamize de D√≠az. She went to primary school in her home city, but for secondary school she moved to the capital, where she studied to be a teacher at the normal school there. She then returned to Las Tablas to begin working as a teacher, where she also created a night school program for illiterate residents of the city. However, powerful city leaders felt threatened by her literacy program, and she lost her job as a consequence. When she was 17 years old, D√≠az wed Eleazar Escobar Restrepo, a Colombian teacher who was the mayor of Las Tablas at the time. But she was widowed shortly thereafter when her husband was killed in the Thousand Days' War. His death was followed by that of her younger daughter, who was only 2 years old. In this period, D√≠az began writing poetry, publishing verses in magazines and newspapers both in Panama and abroad. She also returned to teaching, serving as director of the Chitr√© School before returning to teach in Las Tablas. She later worked as a teacher at a boys' school in Panama City. In 1915, she married again. But her new husband, the Spanish businessman Pedro Ross, died only a few weeks later, of a brain condition. After Ross' untimely death, D√≠az decided to start fresh and found work at the National Archives of Panama, where she remained until her retirement. She wed a third time in 1918, to the Russian Mendel S. Schtronn, a marriage that lasted until his death. Most Panamanian poetry of the period was published in periodicals, with very few books released. However, in 1922 D√≠az became the first Panamanian woman to publish a book of verse, Nieblas del Alma. Her second book, Cuadros, followed in 1937. She was part of a generation of Panamanian poets who focused on themes of independence and national identity, and her work is sometimes considered part of the Modernist wave. D√≠az was also a founding member of Panama's first feminist organization, the Centro Feminista Renovaci√≥n. In 1923, she participated as a delegate in the country's First Feminist Congress, and she was an officer in the National Feminist Party. In 1946, D√≠az suffered a stroke that left her nearly paralyzed; a second stroke in 1947 left her nearly blind. She died in Panama City in 1948.

It is the oldest known Stingaree genus, though molecular data suggests they diverged from Butterfly rays about 75 million years ago or from Deepwater stingrays around the time of the K-Pg transition. The type species, A. arambourgi, is known from isolated teeth found in the Ypresian deposits of Ouled Abdoun, Morocco. It is named for Camille Arambourg, who originally ascribed these teeth to Raja praealba in 1952. Henri Cappetta revised the species in 1983, erecting this genus for those Arambourg called males in this genus and placed the ones he called females in Merabatis. The second species, A. crassicaudata is from the Ypresian-age Bolca Lagerst√§tte of Italy and is known from several articulated individuals. This species was described in 1818 and was placed in various genera until finally being attributed to this one in 2020.

She grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and was recognized as New Mexico's most famous singer during the early 20th century. She performed with various opera companies during her career, most notably the Carl Rosa Opera Company in the United Kingdom. Early life Albright was born in Howard, Kansas in 1873. Her parents were John G. Albright, a newspaperman who later owned the Albuquerque Journal, and Franc Luse Albright, a photographer. The family moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1880, and then Albuquerque in 1882. She attended St. Vincent's Academy in Albuquerque, the Kenwood Institute in Chicago, and Vassar College. Opera career After leaving Vassar, she went with her mother to Paris, where she took voice lessons from Anna de La Grange and then joined the Op√©ra-Comique in 1901. At the time, she was one of only five Americans to have performed there, along with other notable singers like Mary Garden and Sibyl Sanderson. In 1903, she returned to the United States and joined Henry Wilson Savage's Castle Square Opera Company, where she toured nationally in various productions, mostly English-language versions of famous operas. Her best-known roles with the company were as Kundry in Parsifal and Br√ºnnhilde in Die Walk√ºre. In 1910 she returned to Europe, joining the Stadtheater Bremen and then the influential Carl Rosa Opera Company in London. In Britain she received favorable reviews in a number of leading roles including Azucena in Il trovatore, Ortrud in Lohengrin, and the title role in Mignon. She then came back to the United States in 1912, spending a season with the Aborn Opera Company. Albright's mother and aunt both died in 1912‚Äì13 and she had to take time away from the opera to help settle their estates. She performed at the Panama‚ÄìCalifornia Exposition in San Diego in 1915 and then joined the La Scala Grand Opera Company in Los Angeles for the 1916 season. In 1917 she married Edward W. Roberts, a construction engineer, and largely retired from touring. She died in 1923 of suspected heart failure and was buried at Fairview Memorial Park in Albuquerque.

Later accounts make him the second director of the school, but this is an error.

The Ma≈°lmonutho is compilation of grammatical and philological material designed to help standardize Syriac orthography and pronunciation: see . Joseph invented the nine accents or points of Syriac ekphonetic notation.See Grove. These punctuation marks indicate tone and rhythm for recitation. According to the Jacobite historian Bar Hebraeus, Joseph merely altered a preexisting system from Edessa into the one that prevailed in the Nestorian churches. The truth may lie somewhere between these interpretations. Joseph's systems was in widespread use by 600. Bar Hebraeus also records that Joseph wrote a work on homographs, which may have been the first in the history of the Syriac language. Since the Syriac alphabet is purely consonantal, homographs are words with the same consonants but different vowels and different meanings. According to the Nestorian manuscripts and the work of the Nestorian literary historian  øAbdisho ø bar Brikha, the Syriac translation of Dionysius Thrax's Art of Grammar was the work of Joseph. The Jacobite manuscript tradition, however, leaves the translation anonymous. This translation may better be called an adaptation. Joseph omits those part of the Art that are specific only to Greek (such as those on orthography and phonology), while adapting others (e.g., diathesis) with Syriac examples.

The Mughal rulers were successful in reigning over a long period of time over the vast area of the subcontinent because of their administrative and religious policy, which provided for the cohesion among various sects and creeds. Both Babur and Humayun were busy throughout their regnal years in wars and conquest apart from suppression of revolt and couldn't devote enough time for the administration and policies formulation. It was Akbar (who promoted the syncretic religion called Dƒ´n-i IlƒÅhƒ´ ) during whose reign the religious policy of the Mughals were formulated. The later Mughals followed Akbar but violation of his policy went unbated many a times leading to the complete downfall of the theory of \\"divine religion\\" propounded by Akbar during the regnal years of Aurangzeb. Abu'l-Fazl, one of the disciples of Din-i-Ilahi, presenting Akbarnama to Akbar, Mughal miniature. Jahangir When Jahangir ascended the throne there was a hope among theologians that Akbar's policies of ·π¢ul·∏•-i-kul will be brought to an end. Jahangir's initial farmans presented an indication of the conversion of the Mughal Empire into a truly Islamic empire. He asked the Ulemas to prepare a set of distinctive appeals to the god which might be easy to remember as he wanted to repeat them while using his rosary. He also met the pious and religious persons on Fridays and distributed the alms and gifts to the dervishes. But in no way Jahangir was an orthodox though he often showed the incidents of narrow mindedness. Jahangir was habitual of drinking and he writes in his memoirs to have reduced the intake of distilled spirit from 20 cups to five cups after his accession to the throne and that too on night. Meanwhile, he also used to invite his nobles while drinking and music and dance were common in his courts. All these practices were considered as un- islamic for the orthodox Ulemas. He is said to have prohibited cow slaughter in Punjab and extended it to the Gujarat. The various Hindu festivals were celebrated in the court and he himself used to participate in them and carried out distribution of gifts. But there are many incidents which presents an opposite view of his religious ecclesiasticism. The war against Mewar was declared as Jihad. The Mughal army while marching towards Mewar destroyed many Hindu temples but Jahangir had warned strictly to prince Khurram to treat Rana Amar Singh I as a friend if he prepares to submit. Thus, when Rana submitted and sued for the peace he was given an honourable treatment as Jahangir notes: In 1621, the Kangra campaign was also declared as a Jihad though from the side of the Mughals, Hindu Raja Bikramjit commanded it. Jahangir while his visit to Haridwar founded that Hindus who renounced the worldly life were seeking pleasure on the path of god here and he distributed gifts to them. In Ajmer also he distributed gifts and money to entire village of Pushkar while the Varaha image of Vishnu was ordered to be broken. Perhaps he was not satisfied with the manifestation of god in various forms, as no step was taken to destroy various other images of Vishnu. In his reign people like Vir Singh Bundela erected grand temples at Mathura. Jahangir himself visited Brindawan and distributed alms to the Mathas of Chaitanya sect. According to Historian R.P Tripathi, he was less tolerant than Akbar but more than Shah Jahan on the ground of religion. There are incidents when he showed his narrow level of tolerance and inflicted heavy penalties upon some of the notable people. In the case of Guru Arjun Dev, Jahangir saw his support of Khusrau as trason. Jahangir is said to have inflicted heavy dues upon him and the excessive torture inflicted upon him to realise the dues led to loss of his life. He also imprisoned his son and successor, Guru Hargovind. The Emperor also penalised many leading Muslims upon his disagreement to some of their views. The notable Sufi saint Sheikh Ahmad Sirhindi once remarked that he once came closed to the god than the Caliphs in his dreams and was punished by the Emperor as he strongly refuted his claims. Another Sufi called Shaikh Nizam Thanesari was banished to Mecca on the charge of accompanying Khusrau Mirza for some distance. He started a practice of rewarding the pious and knowledgeable person after testing their knowledge and economic condition everyday. He ordered such people to be brought before him and after their personal examination he forwarded monetary and other support to them, but this practice was restricted to Muslims only. Jahangir found more satisfaction in the theory of Vedanta, which he called Science of Tasawwuf. He became an admirer of Jadrup Gosain, who according to him had mastered this science and used to live in a hole in a mountain. Jahangir walked barefooted to see him and on meeting with him he was impressed with his knowledge and simplicity. He wanted to invite him to Agra but was alarmed by the orthodox elements. Later, Jadrup Gosain moved to Mathura, where Jahangir met him twice. He also dismissed the brother-in-law of Nur Jahan, Hakim Beg from the governorship of Mathura as he disrespected Gosain. Jahangir also hosted Brahmins in his court and often used to listen to them as for example, a Brahmin from Gujarat who accompanied Ramdas Kachhwaha used to present his discourse upon sanctity of Cows and the story of Dadhichi, a sage who offered his bones for the cause of world. Shah Jahan The reign of Shah Jahan saw a shift from the liberal policies upto some extent. In the 6th regnal year he announced that the Temples whose foundation has been laid in the reign of Jahangir but hadn't been completed yet should be destroyed or the project to be stopped altogether. He however allowed those Temples which were completed before his accession to throne to survive. The growing current for the revival of Islam was witnessed in the Emperor's preference of showing the Islam as a dominant religion, which led to establishment of grand Mosques like Jama Masjid at Delhi and Taj Mahal at Agra. These monuments were commensurate to the Islamic idea of paradise. Meanwhile, two strong current of \\"orthodoxy\\" and \\"liberalism\\" was running during his reign. While the banner of liberalism was in the hands of Dara Shukoh and Jahanara, Sheikh Abdul Haq and Sheikh Ahmad Sirhindi were the leaders of orthodox section. Sheikh Ahmad Sirhindi urged the Emperor to impose Jizya upon the non Muslims and declared Both Hindus and Shia Muslim to be heretics (Kafir) in his pamphlet. He was in favour of strict enforcement of the injunctions of the Sharia. Dara Shikoh (with Mian Mir and Mullah Shah Badakhshi), ca. 1635 Shah Jahan joined neither of this religious current and while proclaiming the state to be an Islamic one, he never refrained from the liberal policies completely. He also took the form of a staunch Muslim emperor at times and it was witnessed during the Bundela rebellion, when Temple built by Vir Singh Bundela at Orchha was destroyed by the Mughal forces. Shah Jahan supported some of the wealthy Jain merchants and offered them land and other sort of assistance. Thus, Shantidas was granted land in Ahmedabad, where he built a beautiful Temple. No step was taken to prohibit him from doing so until Aurangzeb was posted as a governor of Gujarat and the Temple was forcibly converted into a Mosque. Later, on a complaint made by Shantidas and due to a decree of a leading Qazi that banishing someone from his personal possession is against the Islamic jurisprudence, Shah Jahan restored the Temple to him . As an Emperor, Shah Jahan didn't allow the orthodox elements to dominate and except few incidents of narrow mindedness like in the reign of Jahangir, the Empire as a whole ran with support of heterogeneous nobility in which Hindus were given proper representation. He was also fond of music and dance like Jahangir and Dhrupad was his favourite musical form and Hindu musician Jagannath was given the title of Maha Kavi Rai (great poet). Shah Jahan is said to have banned mix marriages in Kashmir which implied Muslim girls to took up the custom and religion of their Hindu husbands. The letters which Sheikh Ahmad Sirhindi and Sheikh Abdul Haq wrote to him presents a glossary of demands from the part of orthodox elements to put heavy restrictions upon Hindus. Shah Jahan also came into conflict with Sikh Guru Hargobind which resulted in Battle of Kartarpur after which, Guru took shelter in the Kashmir hills. But above all these liberal elements were still active in the empire with Mian Mir and his successor Mullah Shah Badakhshi, who were mentor of Dara Shukoh propagating idea of mutual co- existence.Hanif, N. (2000). Biographical Encyclopaedia of Sufis: South Asia. Sarup & Sons, New Delhi. . pp. 205‚Äì209. Aurangzeb Aurangzeb's religious policies are one of the most debated topic than those of other Mughal rulers. Some historians like Jadunath Sarkar consider his religious stand to be full of bigotry and religious intolerance while others like Shibli Naumani describes it as a matter of political expediency. Satish Chandra explains it neutrally, while not going in the debate of \\"for\\" and \\"against\\". Some of the Aurangzeb's policy can be seen as a direct attack on Hindus while others could be seen as need of time. In the initial years of his reign, Aurangzeb floated the farmans which called for banning of practices like Jharokha Darshan; Tula Dan (weighing the Emperor against the gold and silver) which was started by Akbar. He also prohibited inscribing Khutba (Islamic verses) on coins and reimposed Jizya on non-Muslims which was abolished by Akbar. Aurangzeb also ordered all the newly built Temples to be destroyed while the older ones were prohibited from being repaired. He also ordered the governor of Gujarat to prohibit the Hindus from celebrating the festival like Holi and Diwali outside the Bazaars of Ahmedabad. These steps except the last one didn't affect Hindus directly. There are a set of his royal orders which could be seen as a direct attempt to harass Hindus and to portray him as an ideal Islamic ruler. During his governorship of Gujarat, Aurangzeb publicly desecrated newly built \\"Chintaman Temple\\", by killing a cow in its premise and converting it into Mosque. Other steps like demolition of \\"Vishwanath temple\\" at Kashi and imposing a duty of 5% on Hindu traders as compared to 2.5% on Muslims were equally controversial. Despite of all these, Aurangzeb is described as a \\"Man of enigmatic personality\\" and not a bigot. He banned music in the royal court which affected not only Hindus but Muslim musicians as well. He is said to have reduced Rahdari (road tax) and other duties which he found illicit. Aurangzeb's reimposition of Jizya is explained by later historians as the attempt to rally Muslims together, specifically the orthodox ones in a war against Marathas and Rajput kingdoms and also against the Deccani Sultanates which had sided with the heretics. It is paradoxical that he banned music in royal court but a large number of the treatise on music were written during his reign and he himself was proficient in playing Veena. He is also said to have ban Muharram procession in all provinces after violent clashes took place during one such procession. Thus, the stand of Aurangzeb can be described as the stand of a person who due to remorse of his deeds, took shelter in the shell of religion. The number of Hindus in mansab was not reduced as compared to his predecessors and he continued to have good relations with the Rajputs. Sawai Jai Singh remained his close companions and he even pitted him against numerous Hindu kings including Shivaji.

The upper tier is largest, plunging between into a narrow gorge where the small middle tier is found. As the creek spills out of the canyon, it plunges another to the valley floor. In addition, resurgent stream spills out of the side of the cliff and joins the upper fall from the east. The waterfall is fed by Helmet Creek, which itself is formed from the meltwater of West Washmawapta Glacier located atop the aforementioned hanging valley. The creek is a tributary of Vermilion River. Access Helmet Falls is located at the end of a , moderately difficult hiking trail. The trailhead is located at the Painted Pots parking lot off Highway 93.

Completed and commissioned in September 1943, she served in the central Pacific Ocean during World War II and was sunk in June 1944 during her second war patrol. Design and description The submarines of the K6 sub-class were versions of the preceding K5 sub-class with greater range and diving depth. They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of . They had a diving depth of .Bagnasco, p. 187 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor.Chesneau, p. 203 They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the K6s had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at . The boats were armed with four internal bow torpedo tubes and carried a total of ten torpedoes. They were also armed with a single L/40 anti-aircraft gun and two single AA guns.Carpenter & Dorr, p. 124 Construction and commissioning Ro-44 was laid down as Submarine No. 385 on 14 February 1942 by Mitsui Zosensho at Tamano, Japan. On 1 November 1942, she was renamed Ro-44, and she was attached provisionally to the Maizuru Naval District that day. She was launched on 11 November 1942 and was completed and commissioned on 13 September 1943. Service history =September 1943‚ÄìJanuary 1944= Upon commissioning, Ro-44 was attached formally to the Maizuru Naval District and assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups. During her work-ups, the commander of Submarine Squadron 11, Rear Admiral Noboru Ishizaki, arranged for her to test an experimental air-search radar borrowed from Kure Naval Air Station in the Iyo-nada in the Seto Inland Sea on 13 and 14 November 1943. After Ishizaki reported the results of the tests, he was rebuffed because he conducted them without the approval of the Navy Technical Department. Later in November 1943, Ro-44 moved from Kure to Maizuru. On 25 December 1943, Ro-44 was reassigned to Submarine Division 34 in the 6th Fleet. She departed Maizuru in company with the submarine on 28 December 1943 bound for the Nechap submarine base at Truk, which she reached on 6 January 1944. She brought aboard provisions from the auxiliary submarine tender there on 12 January 1944. =First war patrol= Assigned a patrol area off Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides, Ro-44 got underway from Truk at 16:30 on 15 January 1944, exiting the lagoon via South Pass to begin her first war patrol. While she was at sea, United States Navy Task Force 58 conducted Operation Hailstone, a major attack on Truk by carrier aircraft supported by anti-shipping sweeps around the atoll by surface warships, on 17 and 18 February 1944. Ro-44 was inbound to Truk at 13:26 Japan Standard Time (JST) on 17 February when she received orders to proceed to a position northeast of Truk at flank speed to intercept a U.S. force of two battleships, two cruisers, and two destroyers Japanese forces had sighted in that area. A little over three hours later, at 16:47 JST, she received new orders to move to a position northeast of Truk Lagoon‚Ä≤s Dublon Island, known to the Japanese as Natsushima (\\"Summer Island\\"). At 22:14 on 18 February 1944, while on the surface from Dublon and bearing 066 degrees from the island, she sighted two unidentified aircraft and submerged. She reported the encounter in a message she transmitted at 22:55, which Fleet Radio Unit, Melbourne (FRUMEL), an Allied signals intelligence unit headquartered at Melbourne, Australia, intercepted, decrypted, and reported on 19 February 1944. On 21 February 1944, Ro-44 concluded her patrol, returning to Truk and anchoring off the Nechap submarine base. =Mili supply runs= On 28 February 1944, Ro-44 departed Truk to make a supply run to Mili Atoll in the Marshall Islands, carrying food in rubber containers tied down on her afterdeck, 25-mm anti-aircraft ammunition, mail, and a set of new codebooks for the garrison. Shortly after departure, however, all of the rubber containers went overboard in heavy seas and were lost, and Ro-44 returned to Truk. On 2 March 1944, Ro-44 again left Truk, carrying 11 metric tons of food and ammunition and with orders to deliver her cargo to Mili and then conduct a reconnaissance of the U.S. fleet anchorage at Majuro during her return voyage to Truk. She had passed Jaluit and was approaching Mili from the west after dark on 9 March 1944 when she sighted a southeast-bound U.S. Navy task force made up of two aircraft carriers, a battleship, and a cruiser. She began an approach at 17:45 JST, but was too far away to launch an attack. She surfaced and pursued the ships for about an hour before losing contact. She sighted six U.S. destroyers at around 20:00 and submerged. Ro-44 arrived off Mili on 11 March 1944, surfaced after dark, and entered the lagoon. She discharged her cargo, embarked 17 passengers, and quickly got back underway. As she approached Majuro on 13 March 1944 to conduct her reconnaissance, she sighted a red light ahead at 01:00 and submerged. As she closed on the atoll, she saw additional lights, leading her commanding officer to conclude that U.S. forces had constructed an airfield at Majuro. He then observed an aircraft carrier, eight battleships and several tank landing craft inside the lagoon. Ro-44 left the area at dawn on 13 March and later that day reported what she had seen to Truk. She arrived at Truk on 29 March 1944. =April‚ÄìMay 1944= After Japanese forces reported an Allied task force off Kavieng on New Britain, Ro-44 departed Truk to operate in a holding area south of Truk to await further orders. She returned to Truk on 15 April 1944. On 17 April 1944, 16 United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-24 Liberators raided Truk, and Ro-44 and the submarine submerged in the lagoon to avoid attack. Both submarines suffered minor damage from near-misses. On 20 April 1944, 17 USAAF B-24s attacked the anchorage, and Ro-44 and the other submarines present again submerged. When Ro-44 surfaced, her crew discovered that she had suffered periscope damage that could only be repaired in Japan. She departed Truk the same day bound for Kure, and soon was strafed by an American plane, suffering slight additional damage from the plane‚Ä≤s machine guns. Ro-44 reached Kure on 29 April 1944 and began repairs and an overhaul, during which a Type 13 air- search radar was installed. After the work was complete, she departed Kure on 15 May 1944 and arrived at Saipan in the Mariana Islands on 19 May 1944. =Second war patrol= On 23 May 1944, Ro-44 put to sea from Saipan to begin her second war patrol. Her orders called for her to conduct a periscope reconnaissance of Eniwetok, which she did on 10 June 1944. After reporting what she had seen, she made for her assigned patrol area northeast of Eniwetok. On 13 June 1944 the Combined Fleet activated Operation A-Go for the defense of the Mariana Islands, and that day the commander-in-chief of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Takeo Takagi, ordered all available Japanese submarines to deploy east of the Marianas. Ro-44 was among them, receiving orders to proceed to the waters east of the Marianas at flank speed. The Battle of Saipan began with U.S. landings on Saipan on 15 June 1944, and Ro-44 transmitted a routine situation report that day. The Japanese never heard from her again. =Loss= Ro-44 was on the surface making east of Eniwetok in the predawn darkness of 16 June 1944 when the U.S. Navy destroyer escort ‚Äî which was on a voyage from Majuro to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii ‚Äî detected her on radar. Burden R. Hastings closed to and challenged her by Aldis lamp at 03:37. When Ro-44 did not reply, Burden R. Hastings fired four star shells to illuminate the area, and as the second shell burst, Ro-44 crash-dived. At 03:54 Burden R. Hastings detected Ro-44 on sonar dead ahead at a range of and launched an unsuccessful Hedgehog attack. While Ro-44 made radical evasive maneuvers at a depth of , Burden R. Hastings again gained sonar contact on her at a range of and conducted a second Hedgehog attack. Nine seconds later, her crew observed a bioluminescent flash in the water and felt a heavy underwater explosion. Burden R. Hastings passed over the location where her crew had observed the explosion and dropped four depth charges, two set to explode at and the other two at . Five seconds after the last depth charge detonated, another large underwater explosion shook Burden R. Hastings, knocking out some of her electrical equipment. At dawn on 16 June 1944, Burden R. Hastings‚Ä≤s crew observed an oil slick and debris on the surface at . One of her boats recovered debris which identified the sunken submarine as Ro-44. On the day she was sunk, Ro-44 was ordered to move to a new patrol area southeast of the Marianas. She did not acknowledge the orders, and on 12 July 1944 the Imperial Japanese Navy declared her to be presumed lost off Saipan with the loss of all 72 men on board. She was stricken from the Navy list on 10 August 1944.

Set in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, it captures the struggles and human resilience in the battle to survive the pandemic in Wuhan, China. It had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 14, 2020 to critical acclaim.  Production  Production started in Wuhan in February 2020, soon after the lockdown on Wuhan began, at four different hospitals. It continued through the gradual return of order and ended after the lockdown was officially lifted on April 8. During the lockdown, the Chinese government restricted access to hospitals to only patients, medical professionals and reporters. A few of the hardest-hit hospitals only allowed reporters and filming crews thoroughly vetted by the authorities. But that strict control was not applied uniformly to all hospitals or throughout the entire lockdown period. Early in the lockdown when the situation was dire and chaotic and there was a severe shortage of medical supplies, many hospitals actually welcomed media exposure to help them look for help. Some of the medical teams sent from elsewhere in China to support Wuhan were also open to being filmed, partly due to their desire to have their own images documented in this historical moment. Hao Wu found his two co- directors in mid February while researching a pandemic film for a US network. Both had started filming inside Wuhan in early February. They collaborated by sharing daily rushes and discussing filming strategies online. By late March, however, the media environment in China over COVID-19 narratives was severely tightened due to increasing geo-political tension, so the two of them had to stop collaborating with Hao. Hao began editing the co-directors‚Äô footage while under quarantine in Atlanta and after the US network had dropped the project he had been developing. Hao approached the two of them once he had completed a rough cut. They eventually agreed to collaborate with him to complete the film. One director is listed as \\"Anonymous\\", a Chinese reporter who is also a first time filmmaker. Due to the sensitivity around any COVID-19 narrative in China, he would like to remain anonymous to avoid attracting attention. Just like the healthcare workers in this film, the co-directors Weixi Chen and Anonymous had to put on heavy Personal Protective Equipment every day, which was very uncomfortable to wear, was hard to breathe in and made them feel sick at times. And once they were in the contamination zone, they had to stay there for hours at a time, with no bathroom breaks, just like the doctors and nurses. Every night after filming they would go through a thorough disinfection ritual and go back to rest alone in hotels reserved for front- line workers. Their existence during the lockdown was an exhausting one, both physically and emotionally. Release The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 14, 2020. Shortly after, MTV Documentary Films acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film. It also screened at the AFI Fest on October 16, 2020 and was the opening night film for the Double Exposure Film festival on October 14, 2020.  Reception  On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100%, based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 8.08/10. The website's consensus reads, \\"A raw, fly-on-the-wall recounting of hospital life in Wuhan in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, 76 Days is an engrossing and potent documentary - and a surprisingly comforting portrait of humanity.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 81 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".

He is the master of ceremonies for the annual Los Angeles event series Bent, which celebrates drag and queer identities. Cider was the main focus of Nicole Miyahara's 2013 documentary The Making of a King. Cider began working with World of Wonder in 2016 and appeared on James St. James' Transformations. He later hosted the first King Panel at DragCon. Cider wrote an op-ed for The Advocate, criticizing RuPaul's position that females performing drag does not have the irony that males performing drag does. In 2019, Cider joined the cast of season 3 of The Boulet Brothers' Dragula, becoming the first drag king to appear on an American drag competition show. She won the season and was crowned the \\"World's Next Drag Supermonster\\" by the Boulet Brothers. Cider was also a judge on Alaska Thunderfuck's \\"Drag Queen of the Year Pageant\\" that year. He was listed on Pride Magazine's \\"11 Drag Kings You Should Definitely Know About\\". In February 2020, Cider hosted Pride Union's 18th Annual Drag Show Finals with Manila Luzon. Landon Cider hosts Socially Distant, a digital drag livestream. The show aired on April 2, 2020 and featured drag artists such as Hugo Grrrl and Charli Deville.

First launched in 2013, it primarily serves passengers patronizing bars, clubs and other entertainment venues located along the Santa Monica corridor. History The PickUp was soft launched on August 9, 2013, with service formally commencing the following weekend. It was West Hollywood's second attempt at a running a nighttime shuttle bus service; the first attempt, which ran during the 1990s, failed due to low ridership. Initially running along Santa Monica Boulevard between Robertson Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue as a trial service that would last until the end of the year, the city government of West Hollywood allocated $71,000 for the project, pitching it as a \\"flirtatious take on public transit\\". Ridership averaged between 1,300 and 1,400 riders per weekend in its first month, with ridership higher on Saturdays than Fridays, and averaging around 1,200 riders per weekend in its first year. Owing to strong positive reception from riders, residents and businesses, in January 2014 the West Hollywood City Council voted to continue the service, and the following year it approved expanding The PickUp to its current service pattern, introducing limited Sunday and holiday service as well as extending the route to the eastern end of West Hollywood city limits. Permanent year-round Sunday service was subsequently introduced on October 2, 2016. Operations and service pattern Service map of The PickUp as of August 16, 2016, showing the service's route and schedule The PickUp runs a single west-east route along Santa Monica Boulevard, starting at the intersection of Santa Monica Boulevard and La Brea Avenue. It then runs west, serving stops on the northern side of Santa Monica Boulevard until the last westbound stop on Ramage Street, where it then turns onto Almont Drive and Melrose Avenue before turning onto La Peer Drive and back again onto Santa Monica Boulevard where, traveling eastward, it then serves stops on the southern side. Buses run every 15 minutes from 8:00 pm to 3:00 am on Fridays and Saturdays, and from 2:00 pm to 10:00 pm on Sundays, complementing existing Los Angeles Metro bus service and giving riders additional transportation options. Stops are identified with bright yellow signs, and are often located in front of bars, clubs and other entertainment venues. A number of prominent West Hollywood establishments are served with PickUp stops; these include Barney's Beanery, served by the stop at Santa Monica and Kings Road; The Abbey, served by the stop at Santa Monica and Robertson Boulevard; and the Pacific Design Center, served by the stop at Santa Monica and San Vicente Boulevard. On April 1, 2020, the city government of West Hollywood announced that services on The PickUp would be suspended indefinitely owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in California. =Fleet= The PickUp operates trolley- shaped buses manufactured by Freightliner Trucks which can sit up to 29 passengers at any one time, although the buses are certified for a maximum capacity of 35 passengers along with one space for a wheelchair. Operated by transport operator American GTS on behalf of the City of West Hollywood, buses are painted bright yellow, with pop art design elements reminiscent of the 1960s being part of the buses' design. Buses are equipped with wooden benches, a photo booth called \\"The PickUp Shot\\" which can upload photos to social media, and a jar of complimentary condoms located by the driver's seat. Music curated by local DJ Derek Monteiro, described as being either house or ambient trance, is also played in the background for passengers. =Fares= Passengers may ride The PickUp free of charge, with the cost absorbed by the City of West Hollywood, although the city government has considered using corporate sponsorships to ensure continued funding for the service. In 2018, a passenger trip cost the city government around $6.50. Aside from subsidizing fares, to help promote ridership a number of businesses along Santa Monica Boulevard offer discounts and other benefits for riders, including VIP entry, free food and discounts on drinks. Reception and accolades Public reception to The PickUp has been generally positive, with 93% of passengers reporting they were either satisfied or very satisfied with the service according to a 2018 city-commissioned survey of riders. The city government of West Hollywood has been awarded a number of times for marketing campaigns related to The PickUp. In April 2014, the city was given the Excellence in Communications Award by the California Association of Public Information Officials for its marketing efforts in launching the service, and later that year the Los Angeles chapter of the Public Relations Society of America likewise awarded it the PRism Award of Excellence for its fresh approach to promoting public transit.

It uses other information such as GPS, wind information, the aircraft's attitude, and aerodynamic properties to estimate or infer the air data quantities. Though air data includes altitude, airspeed, pressures, air temperature, Mach number, and flow angles (e.g., Angle of Attack and Angle of sideslip), existing known SADS primarily focuses on estimating airspeed, Angle of Attack, and Angle of sideslip. SADS is used to monitor the primary air data system if there is an anomaly due to sensor faults or system faults. It can also be potentially used as a backup to provide air data estimates for any aerial vehicle. Functionality Synthetic air data systems can potentially reduce risk by creating an extra layer of redundancy (analytical redundancy) to the mechanical air data system such as the Pitot-static systems and angle vanes. It can also be used to detect failures of other subsystems through data compatibility checks.  History  The idea of SADS has been around since the 1980s. The basic idea is to use non air data sensors such as Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and GPS fused with vehicle dynamics models to estimate air data triplet airspeed, angle of Attack, and angle of sideslip (either separately or combined). Most of the earlier work used vehicle dynamics models to estimate air data in both aircraft and spacecraft applications. This approach is sometimes referred to as the aerodynamic model-based SADS. However, the aerodynamic model-based SADS is challenging to implement because it is difficult to obtain accurate vehicle dynamics models possessing the fidelity needed to yield the required accuracy in the air data estimates. To address this issue, model-free SADS has been proposed recently. The model-free SADS does not require the vehicle dynamics models. Instead, it relies on the accuracy of the Inertial navigation system (INS) and Three-Dimensional (3D) wind estimates. SADS has gained a lot of renewed interest after the Air France Flight 447 accident in 2009. Several universities and government agencies such as the University of Minnesota, Delft University of Technology, NASA Langley Research Center, and the Institute of Flight Mechanics and Flight Control at Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen, have been researching the SADS related topics. Recent patents related to SADS have been filed by the leading air data system producers such as Collins Aerospace and Honeywell. Moreover, the recent two Boeing 737 Max accidents (Lion Air Flight 610 (2018) and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 (2019)) have brought SADS into the spotlight again, which is detailed by the report. In particular, synthetic airspeed has become a focal point to improve Boeing aircraft's safety. =Commercial Aircraft = SADS has been implemented in some of the most advanced modern commercial aircraft such as the Boeing 787. The ADS on Boeing 787 calculates a synthetic airspeed from the angle of attack measurement, inertial data, accurate Lift coefficient, and aircraft mass (validated after takeoff). The synthetic airspeed has helped the Boeing 787 recover from the erroneous airspeed measurement. = Unmanned Aerial Vehicles = SADS has also been implemented for Unmanned aerial vehicle UAVs (drones). The motivation of SADS for UAVs is that most of the low-cost air data systems on the small Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) are not reliable. Also, having multiple air data sensors (e.g., Pitot tubes) on small UAVs is not feasible due to stringent size, weight, and power constraints. SADS can significantly increase drones' overall reliability in both Line-Of-Sight and Beyond Visual Line-Of-Sight (BVLOS) drone operations. Recent academic research has focused on improving SADS's accuracy, fault detectability, and reliability of the ADS used on small UAS by leveraging SADS.  Air Data Triplet  Definition of airspeed V_a , angle of attack \\\\alpha and angle of sideslip \\\\beta on a small Unmanned aerial vehicle. The airspeed V_a , angle of attack \\\\alpha , and angle of sideslip \\\\beta represents the air data triplet, and the current state of art of SADS is to estimate these three quantities either together or separately. One way to estimate the air data triplet is use the wind triangle relationship. Mathematically, the wind triangle equation is shown below: \\\\big[\\\\begin{array}{ccc} u & v & w \\\\end{array} \\\\big]^T = {\\\\bf C}_n^b( \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\psi}^n_{nb} )\\\\left[{\\\\bf v}^n - {\\\\bf W}^n\\\\right] where u , v , and w are the translation velocity components expressed in the body frame, {\\\\bf C}_n^b( \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\psi}^n_{nb}) is the coordinate transformation from North-East-Down (NED) frame to the body frame. The vector \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\psi}^n_{nb} = \\\\big[\\\\phi ~\\\\theta ~\\\\psi \\\\big]^T represents the attitude vector in roll, pitch, and yaw. The {\\\\bf v}^n and {\\\\bf W}^n represent the ground velocity and wind vector in the NED frame respectively. If the u , v , and w are known, the airspeed V_a , angle of attack \\\\alpha and angle of sideslip \\\\beta can be calculated as the following: V_a = \\\\sqrt{u^2 + v^2 + w^2} \\\\alpha = \\\\tan^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{u}{v}\\\\right) \\\\beta = \\\\sin^{-1} \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{v}{\\\\sqrt{u^2 + v^2 + w^2}}\\\\right)  Method  There are various methods to estimate or \\"synthesize\\" airspeed, angle of attack, and angle of sideslip without directly using the measured air data. For example, synthetic airspeed can be computed by using the ground velocity, angle of attack, wind velocity, airplane's pitch attitude and heading. The ground velocity is usually provided by GPS. The angle of attack measurements can come from the angle vanes. The wind velocity can be obtained by the airborne weather radar. The attitude of the airplane can be computed from the inertial navigation system. The exact computation of the synthetic airspeed can vary (e.g., small-angle approximation can be made to simplify the computation), but it is primarily based on the kinematic wind triangle equation. This method is sometimes referred to as the model-free SADS method; there is no vehicle model dynamics involved. The model-based SADS leverages the vehicle dynamics model to help estimate the air data quantities. In particular, the aerodynamic coefficients are used to compute synthetic air data. For example, angle of attack \\\\alpha can be synthesized if the Lift coefficient C_L , Mach number M , and altitude h are known. Mathematically, \\\\alpha = f(C_L,~M,~h) The function f(\\\\cdot) that relates C_L to \\\\alpha can be empirically determined by curve fitting the aerodynamic data. The accuracy of the model-based SADS depends on the accuracy of the aerodynamic coefficient. This accuracy constraint might not an issue for high performance aircraft such as F-15, but it can be quite difficult for low-cost UAVs. Many model-based and model-free SADS utilize classical estimation methods such as Kalman filtering and Least Squares extensively to estimate air data when sensor fusion and real-time computing are required. Other non-conventional methods such as data-driven learning or machine learning based air data estimation algorithms have emerged in the last decade, but they are difficult to be certified due to the complexity of the algorithms.

Selected works Levine's work encompasses performance, installation, and video. Performance installations include Bauerntheater, Farmers‚Äô Theater in 2007, a project in Joachimsthal, Germany sponsored by the German Federal Cultural Foundation in which he hired an American actor to learn German farming and then \\"farm\\" on a publicly accessible field for 10 hours a day, six days a week, for six weeks. This was an early example of his later themes of \\"acting as a technique for absolutely turning into someone else.\\" In 2012 he created the performance installation Habit in which the audience is mobile, viewing the performance through the windows of a house, moving from vantage point to vantage point as the action moves. The actors in Habit worked for eight-hour days, performing the same 90 minutes worth of dialogue by playwright Jason Grote, but improvising the staging from moment- to-moment. In the summer of 2015, as a commission from the public art organization Creative Time, he restaged iconic scenes from movies set in New York's Central Park. Actors performed the scenes in their original location, on a perpetual loop, for six hours a day. in what The New Yorker called \\"A Real-Life GIF in Central Park\\". Levine's solo exhibition Some of the People, All of The Time featured 8 actors performing a monologue from the point of view of a movie crowd extra turned paid protester. The New York Times called it some of the best art of 2018. Levine worked as a theater director in New York and Berlin before branching out into conceptual art. For his first solo gallery show, he created an installation entitled Hopeful at the Feinkost gallery in Berlin, which consisted of thousands of actors' headshots collected from the trash cans of New York casting agencies, a meta-commentary on the headshot-as-object. Writing Levine's essays on art, theater, and performance, have been published widely. He is the author, along with Alix Rule, of the 2012 essay, International Art English which describes and diagrams the language of contemporary art by analyzing artists‚Äô statements, wall labels, criticism, and a corpus of more than fourteen thousand press releases sent by e-flux. The essay has been both anthologized and republished, and considered a key text (and term) in debates over the politics of art writing. He wrote and contributed images to A Discourse on Method , an artists' book he created with Shonni Enelow which came out in 2019. An anthology of his writing, Best Behavior, will be published in 2020. Levine's father was one of the executors of the estate of Mark Rothko, a situation that turned into a protracted legal dispute, the Rothko Case. He wrote about the effect that had on his family and his career for Triple Canopy in Matter of Rothko. Awards and recognition Levine was a 2013 Fellow in Visual Arts at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. He was the recipient of a 2018 Guggenheim Fellowship. His installation Habit received a 2013 Village Voice Obie award. His work has been presented by MoMA, Mass MoCA, PS1, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. He has received fellowships and grants from the New York Foundation for the Arts, the MacDowell Colony, the Watermill Center and the Foundation for Contemporary Arts. Early life and education Levine was born in 1970 in New York City to Morton and Anne Marie Levine.

Plebiscite Under the Prohibition Plebiscite Act, a plebiscite was held across the province, in conjunction with municipal elections, on the prohibition of the importation, manufacture, and sale alcohol. For this plebiscite, unmarried women, and widows, were allowed to vote - approximately 5,000 women in Toronto - of which 1,117 did so. Men and women were given different colours, which were counted separately. The plebiscite did not result in the enactment of prohibition legislation by the province, however, as in 1896, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council disallowed provincial authority over the importation of alcohol. ;Prohibition :For - 10,532 (men); 875 (women) - 11,407 (total) :Against - 8,637 (men); 242 (women) - 8,879 (total) Source: Aldermen elected to City Council Map of Toronto's six wards (1892-1909), published in The Globe, 1 January 1892.

She is known for her literary work, as well as for founding the small press Editorial Montemira.  Early life and education  Born Gladys Alicia Eugenia del Rosario in San Jos√©, Costa Rica, in 1952, she was the oldest of five siblings. Her father, who was Costa Rican, and her mother, who was Chilean, were both doctors. Miranda attended primary school at the Methodist School in San Jos√©, then secondary school at the Saint Clare school, where she graduated in 1969. The following year, she left for the United States to begin pre-medical studies at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. She returned to Costa Rica a year later, however, and obtained degrees in French and in Spanish philology from the University of Costa Rica in 1976. Immediately thereafter, she traveled to Paris, where she received a doctorate in Latin American literature from the University of Sorbonne Nouvelle Paris 3 in 1981. During her time at the University of Costa Rica, she participated in student political movements through the youth group known as FAENA, which would later evolve into the Frente Popular Costarricense, a Maoist political party.  Career  Miranda began teaching while still a student at the University of Costa Rica, and she returned to teach grammar at the school after coming back to the country in 1981. She continued to work there until 1985. She also began writing during her time as a student, including research articles in specialized publications and reported pieces for Diaro de las Palmas in the Canary Islands and Vanguardia Dominical in Bucaramanga, Colombia. On her return to Costa Rica, she wrote for the newspaper La Rep√∫blica in San Jos√©. Her first novel, San Isidro, was published in 1980. She published her subsequent novel La huella de abril in 1989. She has also published nonfiction, including Novela, discurso y sociedad in 1985 and Las s√≠labas azules in 1991. In 2005, Miranda founded a small press, Editorial Montemira. Miranda is a longtime friend and admirer of the Indian poet Jayanta Mahapatra, and some of his works have been published in Spanish translation by the publishing house. Miranda has also worked as a translator, including translating such English classics as Romeo and Juliet and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland into Spanish, as well as a translation of a history of Situationist International from French.  Personal life  Miranda met her first husband, the architecture student Manuel Antonio Arg√ºello Rodr√≠guez, during her time as an activist with the FAENA student organization. The couple married in 1976. After their divorce, Miranda remarried, wedding her primary school classmate Eduardo Montes de Oca. The couple had three sons: Sergio, Mauricio, and Bernardo.

During his racing career, he won 15 of 32 starts including the Autumn Handicap and Falls City Handicap. Background Chatterton was a chestnut horse bred in Kentucky by August Belmont II, who had also bred the great Man o' War on the same cross of Fair Play with a daughter of Rock Sand. Fair Play was considered one of the best racehorses of his generation, though a step below the undefeated Colin. He was even better as a sire, leading the American sire list in 1920, 1924 and 1927. In addition to Man o' War, Fair Play sired several other champions and/or important sires like Display, Chance Play and Mad Hatter. Chatterton is a full brother to the notable broodmare √âtoile Filante, whose family has produced multiple stakes winners such as Grindstone and Silverbulletday. During his racing career, Chatterton was owned by Frank Kelley and was trained by Charles Van Meter. Racing career Chatterton raced won 15 of 32 starts, with earnings of $26,565. The highlights of his career were wins in the Autumn Handicap at Latonia and the Falls City Handicap at Churchill Downs in 1922. In the latter race, run on August 30, Chatterton went off at odds of 5-1 while carrying 104 pounds, compared to 108 and 109 pounds on the favored entry of Rockminster and Rouleau. Chatterton had a three length lead at the head of the stretch and managed to hold off a late charge from Rockminster to win by a neck. Stud career Chatterton was originally retired to Kelley's stud farm in California. After Kelley's death, Chatterton was transferred to Claiborne Farm in Kentucky. In 1932, he stood at Arrowbrook Farm in Illinois but returned to Claiborne in 1933 after Faireno's win in the 1932 Belmont Stakes helped make him the leading sire in North America. He sired a total of 213 named foals, 107 (50%) of which became winners. His 11 (5%) black-type winners included Faireno and champion filly Current. Chatterton died on July 14, 1933 due to kidney disease at the relatively young age of 14.

Early life Dana was born on February 12, 1969, in Brattleboro, Vermont to parents Edmund and Veronica Brelsford. While attending The Putney School, Dana was climbing a tree when the branch broke and she fell, breaking her back and paralyzing her from the waist down. At the time, she had just begun cycling at the national level and was ranked among the best cyclists and cross country skiers in the state. Dana had competed at two cycling nationals and various cross-country Junior Nationals. After graduating from The Putney School, Dana attended Marlboro College and the Rhode Island School of Design where she majored in Illustration.

Biography  Alexandra Hernandez was born in Saint Pierre and Miquelon in 1981, the daughter of an Algerian father and Miquelonnais mother. Her mother is of Acadian background, dating back to the colonists' arrival on the archipelago. At age 18, Hernandez left the territory to study music at the University of Montreal, where she studied saxophone for five years. In 2004, after college, she moved to France. There, she learned guitar and began writing songs, taking first prize in several European competitions. Her music is multicultural, balancing between her French and North American roots. She sees herself as neither French, Acadian, or North American, but all three. She \\"seeks to strengthen the ties between the French archipelago and its Canadian neighbors, the Atlantic Provinces.\\" After settling for a period in Landes and dividing her time between France, Quebec, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Hernandez returned permanently to her home territory in 2015. In 2017 she created the Festival Les Transbor√©ales, an annual music festival in Saint Pierre and Miquelon. It aims to bring together French and Canadian artists in unusual locations on the remote archipelago. Hernandez's work has been featured by the French Consulate-General in Moncton, Canada, as part of the Acadie Rock Festival, a celebration of Acadian culture. She also represented her home country at a joint concert celebrating Overseas France at the Olympia in Paris in 2019. In additional to her musical efforts, Hernandez is also a poet.

Synopsis  The Hues is set in Columbus, Ohio, following the narrator Samhita \\"Sami\\" Raju, an Indian- American character. The comic is set during an alien invasion. As the extraterrestrial threat attacks, Sami discovers a supernatural power within herself that helps her survive. Sami goes on to meet other teenagers with similar powers, including Andrea, who has extrasensory empathy, Hannah, who can control fire, and Lauren, who can control electricity. The girls must learn to use their new, not fully controlled powers. The plot of The Hues is mostly driven by the characters as they convert Sami's house for a haven for survivors. While Lauren attempts to stay a lone wolf, Andrea has to deal with the drain her empath abilities put on her.  Development  Heberling says that she started work on the comic in 1998 at age 12, but gave up on it for some time and worked on other comics, including Garanos and autobiographical comic called Alex‚Äôs Guide To A Life Well Lived. Heberling says that her initial version was \\"this trite magic girl fan fiction\\" with similar-looking white characters, but that she was inspired to return to it and to improve its diversity of ethnicities and body types after learning about representation, structural racism in entertainment and media, and how roles in Hollywood get whitewashed so often. Heberling resurrected it \\"as a completely new comic towards the end of 2011 and 2012\\". It was launched in January 2013; Heberling was working full time on The Hues by 2013, though in a 2016 interview Heberling reported doing other cartooning work as well, mainly coloring for Evil Inc. Two volumes of the comic have been printed as physical books through Kickstarter, though in the first Kickstarter Herberling reported problems with a fraudulent backer withdrawing a large donation after rewards were sent.  Reception  A journalist for Columbus Alive in 2015 described it as \\"Sailor Moon and Independence Day colliding at high speeds\\", and called it \\"fast- paced, enthralling and beautifully drawn\\". A reviewer for Sequential Tart disagreed on the pace of the story, describing Volume One as \\"a bit slow\\", and noted some \\"plot convenience on how people and supplies survived\\", but said it had \\"a consistent build from beginning to end\\", praised all the main characters and their diversity, and liked the character designs and their movement. The reviewer rated Volume Two higher, saying, \\"if you're looking for a good, entertaining read that offers a truly diverse cast, this is it. The balance of sci-fi and fantasy is well-integrated with the realistic modern-day setting.\\" The reviewer for Women Write About Comics praised The Hues greatly, including is painstaking care and attention to worldbuilding and detail, the lush art, and the diversity, saying \\"When I said diverse, I wasn‚Äôt kidding: different races, different personalities, different body types, different life preferences, and that‚Äôs true for more than just the core cast.

History and description The church lies north of Strum, to the right of the highway connecting Strum with the village of Suk i Posht√´m. long on the sides and high, the rectangular church is oriented east to west and flat-roofed. The two gates face north and west. The nave and apse were once covered in frescoes that have deteriorated, except for the western portion of the north wall where figures of five saints can be discerned. The √áetiri Brothers of Grabov√´ e Sip√´rme painted the art in 1782, most likely Joan whose work at St. George‚Äôs in Fier is similar. The vaulted gate under the bell tower is original, high, and built of carved white stone with columns supporting an arch decorated with two rosettes. The Greek inscription above the gate dates the church to April 1782. The church was built of limestone from nearby quarries along with marble from ancient ruins, and Lime mortar and interior plaster were used to bind them. The iconostasis and other ceremonial objects are missing, but on the unpaved floor of the shrine near the apse are two remnants of ancient grooved columns and a marble fragment of a capital built in the Doric order, likely harvested nearby in Dimale. The small chapel on the northeastern side is similarly dilapidated but includes two small apses where worshipers once lit candles. The building originally was surrounded on three sides (northern, western, and southern) by a stone wall that was wide and high; only the western portion by the bell tower remains.

Deaf from the age of five, Washburn had a varied career, including creating paintings and etchings and serving as a war correspondent in the Russo-Japanese War, Mexican Revolution, and World War I. He was also an accomplished naturalist, writing on the intelligence of insects and spiders as well as serving on an expedition collecting bird eggs. Early life and education Cadwallader Lincoln Washburn was born October 13, 1866 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He was born into a wealthy family, the son of William Drew Washburn and the grandson of Israel and Martha Washburn. He became deaf at age five after contracting scarlet fever and spinal meningitis. He was a student at the Minnesota State Academy for the Deaf and graduated in 1884. Washburn attended Gallaudet College, graduating as the class valedictorian with a Bachelors of Arts degree in 1890. While he originally planned on studying natural science and entomology, writing essays with his own illustrations of spiders, bees, and caterpillars, he discovered a love for drawing at Gallaudet. He went on to study architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, graduating in 1893. Career in art After graduating from MIT, Washburn moved to New York City, where he shared an apartment with illustrator Howard Chandler Christy. He joined the Art Students League and studied painting under Harry Siddons Mowbray. He took private lessons from painter William Merritt Chase and studied at Chase's Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art, where he returned multiple summers. He traveled to Europe along with Chase and other students, studying with Albert Besnard in Paris and with Joaqu√≠n Sorolla in Spain. While living in Venice, Washburn was inspired to embrace drypoint etching, buying supplies in Paris and creating his first drypoint etchings in 1903. Though he did not begin to etch until he was mid-career, he created over 1,000 etchings. He exhibited regularly around the beginning of the twentieth century, including in the Paris salons, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Art Institute of Chicago, and at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition. His paintings, a part of the realist movement, are marked by a fluid, brushy technique and special attention given to light and atmosphere. Washburn was known as \\"the silent artist\\" and was quoted as saying \\"deafness may sometimes be an inconvenience but never a handicap\\". International travels In 1904, the Chicago Daily News hired him as a war correspondent covering the Russo-Japanese War from Manchuria and Japan via etchings and text. He lived in a temple in Kyoto along with his brother Stanley Washburn. The Washburn brothers discovered the location of the Japanese fleet under Admiral Togo on the Mekong River in Indochina and reported it as a scoop; an international incident resulted from the story as Japan argued France was violating its neutrality. He returned to the U.S. in 1907 and continued to work on his etchings. Washburn traveled to Mexico in 1910 to study architecture and Mexican culture. When the Mexican Revolution began, he reported on the conflict; at one point the railroad station where he was typing a report was riddled with bullets. Washburn was the last outsider to interview the notoriously secretive President Francisco I. Madero shortly before his assassination. When the violence escalated in 1911, he booked passage home on the SS Merida, but the boat sank after a collision and Washburn's copperplates and canvases were lost at sea. He and his brother Stanley became war correspondents again at the outbreak of World War I, traveling through Japan, Hong Kong, and Thailand. In 1916 he returned to the U.S., painting portraits of local Native Americans in Arizona. Washburn then traveled to Mexico again, creating illustrations of bullfighting. In 1925 Washburn traveled to the Marquesas Islands with a scientific expedition, sketching rare birds and collecting eggs. He spent seven months on the islands; his adventures there included meeting a group of islanders who he described as cannibals, teaching them signs and convincing them to model for his etchings. Later life Washburn continued his artwork throughout his life, though by 1937 his eyesight had deteriorated and he switched mediums from etching to oil painting. He was elected an associate of the National Academy of Design in 1940 and exhibited there several times between 1940 and 1955. The De Young Museum held a solo exhibition of his work in 1954. He married Margaret Ohrt in 1943 and they settled in Maine. Washburn returned to studying insects, arguing for the intelligence and communication skills of spiders, bees, and caterpillers. He wrote an essay titled \\"The Mind of a Spider\\" which became required reading in the 1940s in the Washington D.C. public schools, after impressing the superintendent of the school system. Washburn died in Farmington, Maine on December 21, 1965. Awards and legacy Gallaudet College awarded Washburn an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 1924 and he received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Bowdoin College in 1947. In 1969, Gallaudet dedicated the Washburn Arts Center in his honor.

Constructed in 1932 by Sheikh Abdullah bin Hamdan Al Sharqi, the fort formed his principle residence for the following two decades. Consisting of a fortified courtyard house and an associated watchtower with commanding views to the East and West of Wadi Hayl, Al Hayl Fort overlooks the old village of Al Hayl, of which many buildings have now been restored. The village was abandoned in the late 1970s following the resettlement of its inhabitants to a new village further down the wadi, a seasonal watercourse, and protected by the Al Hayl Dam. The village was traditionally settled by members of the Kunud tribe (In 1908, Lorimer described the village, which he named 'Hail' as being located 'inside the hills behind Fujairah' and consisting of 'around ten houses of Jalajilah and Kunud'), with evidence that the area has been settled since the Umm Al Nar period, with Umm Al Nar tombs and Iron Age petroglyphs both found in the area. A number of these are now being threatened by ongoing construction in the area.  Construction  In 1932, Sheikh Abdullah bin Hamdan Al Sharqi constructed the fortified house, a mosque, a majlis and the watchtower. The house was constructed by the Bin Shamal family, builders who worked in Kalba and Fujairah, as well as a builder by the name of Bin Shambi. The buildings are all constructed of gabbro/dolerite rocks bound with a soft mud mortar and faced with plaster. To the interiors, a gypsum plaster was used. The woodwork of the buildings was mangrove with hardwood planking. The watchtower at Al Hayl was originally constructed as a residence for Sheikh Abdullah's younger brother, Suhail, who later moved to a house in the Wadi Furfar. Al Hayl Fort has often been referred to as a summer house, however it was Abdullah bin Hamdan Al Sharqi's residence until he moved to a house constructed in Mirbah in 1958.

The play was based on Walter Lord's 1955 book, A Night to Remember, telling the story of the final night aboard the Titanic. George Roy Hill was the director. The production was a major hit, attracting 28 million viewers and receiving positive reviews from critics. It was nominated for five Emmy Awards (including best program, best writing, best live camera work, best directing, and best art direction). It won the Emmy for live camera work and also won two Sylvania Television Awards as the year's best television adaptation and for best technical production. Plot The play opens with narration by Claude Rains telling of an 1898 novel that seemingly presaged the Titanic tragedy and reviewing the history of the Titanic, its size, and capabilities. The production then turns to the events of the ship's final night. Thomas Andrews, the 39-year-old naval architect who built the Titanic, works in his state room. J. Bruce Ismay, president and managing director of the White Star Line, boasts of plans for a speed run the following morning. Ismay pulls an iceberg warning from his pocket and hands it to the ship's captain, Edward J. Smith. It was the third warning Capt. Smith had received that day. The Titanic Salon Orchestra plays as Capt. Smith dines with the first-class passengers. At 7:30 p.m., the captain receives a fourth warning of icebergs in the ship's path. Four decks below, 712 souls travel in steerage. A young Irish couple performs a jig. In the wireless room, at 9:30 p.m., another ice warning places the Titanic directly within the area of danger. The wireless operator is distracted by stacks of messages passengers wish to send. At 10 p.m., the captain retires to his cabin. At 10:30 p.m., the SS Californian spots an ice field and stops its engines to wait until morning before proceeding. At 11 p.m., the wire operator on the Californian sends a warning to other ships. The Titanic's wireless operator has difficulty understanding the message and replies, \\"Shut up. Shut up. I'm busy.\\" In the first class smoking room, a small group remains, but otherwise quiet settles over the ship. At 11:40 p.m., in the crow's nest, an iceberg is spotted directly ahead. A warning is sent to stop the engine, and the emergency doors are sealed. The Titanic strikes the iceberg. A number of passengers gather on the deck and discover pieces of the iceberg. Capt. Smith returns to the bridge and learns that the ship is taking on water. At 11:55 p.m., Thomas Andrews describes the damage to Capt. Smith and Ismay: The ship has suffered a 300-foot gash and will sink in no more than two hours. Capt. Smith orders the lifeboats readied and the passengers mustered, but no general alarm is to be sounded so as to avoid panic. The Titanic has only 16 lifeboats and four collapsibles, enough to hold only 1,000 of the 3,000 persons on board. Capt. Smith directs the wireless operator to send out a distress call. The wire operator on the nearby Californian is off duty and does not receive the call. In a further effort to attract the attention of the Californian, Capt. Smith orders the firing of rockets. An officer aboard the Californian sees the rockets and notices the Titanic listing. Captain Lord of the Californian is notified but goes back to sleep. At 12:36 a.m., a ship replies to the Titanic's distress call, but it is 58 miles away and will arrive too late. In third class, the passengers are told there is no danger but that they should put on life jackets. The ship begins to list. At 12:15, the covers are removed from the lifeboats, and women and children begin boarding. At 12:42 a.m., the first life boat is lowered with only 20 persons, despite having a capacity of 40 persons. Another lifeboat is lowered with only 12 passengers. The Titanic Salon Orchestra continues to play as the crew continues firing rockets with no response from the Californian. On one side of the ship, only women and children are permitted on the lifeboats. On other side, the rule is relaxed, and Henry Harper boards a lifeboat with his prize Pekingese dog. An elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Isidore Strauss, refuses to be separated and remains on board. Lifeboats continue to be lowered. At 1:30, an officer fires his gun to control entry onto the lifeboats. At 1:46 a.m., Ismay asserts that there is an unclaimed place on one of the final lifeboats and takes it for himself. Claude Rains, who narrated throughout the telecast, intones, \\"At the time President Ismay left his ship, there remained on board 1,643 passengers, among them 168 women and 57 children\\". A small group of women and children had been allowed to evacuate earlier, the remaining steerage passengers were finally permitted to head to the deck shortly before 2 a.m. The final lifeboat is lowered at 2:05 a.m. The captain gives leave for crewmen to abandon their posts with the directive \\"every man for himself.\\" At 2:15 a.m., the orchestra, directed by Wallace Henry Hartley, plays its final piece, the Episcopal hymn \\"Autumn\\". Many passengers jump into the freezing water in their life preservers. Andrews remains calmly aboard. The ship sinks at 2:20 a.m. with 1,502 souls, including many children from steerage. In the closing narration, Rains reviews the iceberg warnings that were not heeded, the lack of sufficient lifeboats, and the failure of the Californian to respond to the Titanic's pleas. Rains closes with these words: \\"Never again has man been quite so confident. An age had come to an end.\\" Cast The production included a cast of 107 actors, 72 with speaking parts.

The story was adapted for television by George Roy Hill and John Whedon (grandfather of Joss Whedon). The art director, Duane McKinney, was responsible for design of the 31 sets. He described the set's replica of the Titanic iconic Grand Staircase as being wide and high. McKinney said that six cameras were used in the production, plus two in reserve. One of the ship's boiler rooms was in a tank with of water and a corridor had water deep. The large tanks had catwalks out of camera range for the actors to use, he said. The production was staged at NBC's Brooklyn Studios. The music was composed and conducted by Wladimir Selinsky. On March 28, 1956, the production was broadcast nationwide on NBC as part of the long-running anthology series, Kraft Television Theatre. The program was a major hit, attracting 28 million viewers and increasing sales of Lord's book. It was rerun on kinescope on May 2, 1956, five weeks after its first broadcast. =Awards= The program was nominated in five categories at the 9th Primetime Emmy Awards: best single program of the year; best teleplay writing (George Roy Hill and John Whedon); best direction (George Roy Hill); best live camera work; and best art direction (Duane McKinney). It won the Emmy for live camera work. It also won two Sylvania Television Awards, as the year's best television adaptation and also for best technical production. Reception The production received positive reviews from critics. In The New York Times, Jack Gould called it \\"technically brilliant\\", \\"a triumph\\", and \\"an extraordinary demonstration of staging technique that imparted a magnificent sense of physical dimension to the home screen.\\" In addition to the \\"sheer magnitude and complexity\\" of the production, Gould also praised the \\"emotional tension and terrifying suspense\\" that were well sustained through the broadcast. In The Boston Globe, Mary Cremmen called it \\"bitterly graphic\\" with an impact that \\"made a viewer wide-eyed with fear.\\" She praised the production's pacing and its restraint in relying on suspense rather than the \\"screams and gushing water and crashing chandeliers\\" that characterized prior dramatizations of the Titanic's sinking. Syndicated television critic John Crosby called it a \\"splendid\\" production and \\"an undertaking of great courage\\". He praised the sets depicting the ship's complicated innards as \\"done so well that we suddenly were practically on the ship\\". As a fan of live television, Crosby called it \\"a particularly happy event\\" in demonstrating the medium's capabilities. In the New York Daily News, Ben Gross called it \\"a moving drama of courage and cowardice\\", \\"a TV show to remember\\", and one of the rare occasions when television departed from the road of mediocrity and proved that \\"TV occasionally can rise to great heights\\". He admired the \\"dignity and restraint\\" exercised in telling the tragic story \\"without indulging in the slightest sensationalism\\". He also praised the \\"air of authenticity\\" in the 31 sets, creating the illusion of being aboard the ship. He found the documentary, factual approach enhanced the \\"almost unbearable emotional impact\\".

However, she is mentioned by Gandhari in the Stri Parva book of the epic. In the Section 21 of Stri Parva, Gandhari describes her to be the mother of Vrishasena and Sushena. It is never cleared whether Karna had one wife or two wives. alt= Most modern sources believe that he had two wives, Vrushali and Supriya. Vrushali is described to be Karna's childhood friend, who was chosen by Karna's foster father Adhiratha as the bride for his son. Supriya is a friend of Duryodhana's wife, Bhanumati. It is unclear whether he married them before or after Draupadi's swayamvar. Karna's wives have been a subject of fantansy. Different stories and folktales mention different. These names include Vrishali, Supriya, Padmavati, Chandravali, Uruvi, Ponnurvi, etc.  Unnamed wife in the Mahabharata  In the Mahabharata, Karna's wives are mentioned by Gandhari. In the section 21 of Stri Vilap Parva, Gandhari describes them or her in the following manner. Here Karna's wives are mentioned to be mothers of Vrishasena and Sushena, who died participating in the Kurukshetra War.  Vrushali  Vrushali, also spelt as Vrishali, (Sanskrit: ‡§µ‡•É‡§∑‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä, ); is the most popular name of Karna's wife. She is the chief consort of Karna and the first of his two wives. The woman mentioned by Gandhari in the Stri Parva is most closely matched by Vrushali. Vrushali belonged to Suta (charioteer) community. She was either the daughter or the sister of Satyasena, Duryodhana's charioteer. Adhiratha, Karna's adoptive father, was a good friend of Satyasena. Vrushali knew Karna from their childhood and was his good friend. When Karna grew up, Adhiratha chose Vrushali as the bride for his son. She married Karna, and became his first and favourite wife. Later, Karna married another lady named Supriya. Vrishasena, Chitrasena and Satyasena were the sons of Vrushali and Karna. But, some believe that Karna married only once and the mother of his all sons was Vrushali. Vrushali is described to be wise and pious, who always supports and consoles her husband, whenever he breaks down in grief. It is believed that after the deaths of her sons and husband, Vrushali was drowned in grief and she ended her life on her husband's pyre.  Supriya  Supriya (Sanskrit: ‡§∏‡•Å‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ, ) is considered as Karna's second wife, first being Vrushali. Supriya was the best friend of Bhanumati, Duryodhana's wife. She was appointed as the maid of Bhanumati, princess of Kalinga. Later, they developed a strong bond of friendship. When Bhanumati's father organised her swayamvara, Duryodhana abducted Bhanumati with the help of his loyal friend, Karna. Bhanumati married with Duryodhana, while Karna married Supriya. Her sons were Banasena, Sushena and Shatrunjaya. It is also believed that Karna's only surviving son, Vrishaketu, was her youngest son. The regional legend of Padmavati In the Kashidasi Mahabharat (a regional version of the epic), Padmavati was the maid of Princess Asawari and the wife of Karna. She is regarded as a version of Supriya. Karna married her after the princess wanted to marry him only to save her father from his wrath at her swayamvara where he defeated all the kings. Her son's name is recorded to be Vrishaketu. Padmavati was the maid of princess Asawari. They were rescued by Karna from some attackers. When Karna asks Asawari's father, the king, for her hand, he rejected her marriage with Karna. Later, Karna attacked the kings at Asawari's swaymvara. Karna asked her if she would like to marry him. She says that she will do anything to save her father. Karna then accepts her maid Padmavati as his wife instead. Padmavati marries him and goes to Anga Kingdom with him.  Modern creation of Uruvi  There is a modern creation of Karna's wife. Kavita Kan√©'s Novel Karna's wife: The Outcaste's Queen, introduces us to Uruvi. The story of Uruvi is specifically created for the novel and some elements including the character's name is based on a Tamil folklore. In the novel, Vrushali remains Karna's first wife, but Supriya is replaced by Uruvi. Uruvi is described to a Kshatriya princess of Pukhiya, a fictional kingdom in the novel. She is the daughter Vashuha and Shubra and fells in love with Karna. Being from a higher caste, her family wants her to marry Arjuna, instead of Karna. But she chooses Karna over Arjuna at her swayamvara. Unlike Vrushali, Uruvi is from a higher caste. She always tries to bring Karna out of the company of Duryodhana, but fails. The event of game of dice, in which Karna calls Draupadi a whore, leaves Uruvi stuck between her morality and love for Karna.

The chair was a collaboration of Wegner and the now-defunct furniture maker Johannes Hansen. It is still in production today by the Danish furniture manufacturer PP M√∏bler. The chair features back and armrests made from one continuous semicircle. The finger joints orient the wood grain as the back rail wraps around the body to maximize material strength. The chair is offered with a solid upholstered seat (PP503) or a seat of woven caning (PP501).  History and cultural impact  In 1949, Wegner designed 3 plywood chairs to display at the annual exhibition of the Copenhagen Cabinetmakers' Guild (Danish: Snedkerlauget). Plywood had become popularized as a furniture material by the Eames and Alvar Alto. His employer, Johannes Hansen (no relation to Carl Hansen & S√∏ns), felt that there were too many other plywood chairs on display and instructed Wegner to create a more traditional chair. Wegner created the chair in only 48 hours. American journalists attended the event and shared the news of this chair back home. Full broadcast of the Kennedy-Nixon debate featuring the chairFrom its inception, the chair was the subject of much attention internationally. The year that the chair was created, The American Interiors Magazine featured the chair on its cover with the title of ‚Äúmost beautiful chair in the world.‚Äù The article included the following caption, ‚ÄúIn this oak desk chair Mr. Wegner uses a simple construction and devotes himself to perfecting the shape and scale of the parts. [...] The sturdy legs are tapered just enough to seem muscular rather than overfed and the seat dips slightly to look willing but not seductive.‚Äù Unlike the Wishbone Chair, the design was not created with productionization in mind. As such, the chair took many hours to construct and Johannes Hansen struggled to fulfill the early orders. A Downtown Chicago club attempted to order 400 chairs but Johannes Hansen (with only a handful of workers at the time) struggled for two years before being able to complete this order. In 1966, it was cited that Johannes Hansen employed around 30 workers and could only produce three Round Chairs per day. In the early models of the chair, Wegner used a mortise and tenon joint to connect the arms to the backrest. Wegner was dissatisfied with the way that this looked and wrapped the backrest in cane to hide what he considered to be an unsightly design and created the illusion that the arms and backrest were constructed from a single piece of wood. In 1950, Wegner updated the design to use a zigzag patterned finger joint to connect the three parts and did away with the cane wrapped backrest (but it continued to be available for special order). Due to the difference in humidity outside of Denmark, the canning seat would sag over time in the United States. To address this, Johannes Hansen released an upholstered version of the chair. Wegner disliked this compromise and was quoted saying, \\"If consumers use their head, they will specify leather; but if they use their heart, they will take their chances with the original caned seat.\\" Form Nov 27, 1951 through Jan 27, 1952, the chair was featured in the 2nd Good Design exhibition at New York Museum of Modern Art and Chicago's Merchandise Mart. It was added to MoMA's permanent collection a year later. On September 26, 1960, the chair was prominently on display in the first televised U.S. presidential debate between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy. Both presidential candidates sat in The Chair during the debate. This event drew more attention to the chair and the emerging Danish modern furniture trend. in 1991, the chair was featured on a Danish postage stamp.  Counterfeits and replicas  The high cost and limited availability of this piece of furniture has fueled many imitations and counterfeit replicas. To demonstrate the extent in which the chair was copied, Johannes Hansen presented 12 replicas of the chair at a company event in 1965. In 2015, a shipment of 100 imitation Round Chairs from China were seized and destroyed by Norwegian customs. The Norwegian restaurant that ordered the knockoffs were forced to pay for the cost of the destruction.

Life and work  His father was a prosperous merchant. He attended the Rabanus-Maurus-Gymnasium and studied philosophy at the . After that, he went to St. Gallen, where he learned the process of making canvases for painting, which was one of his father's principal stocks- in-trade. This proved to be an unsatisfying activity, one for which he was, perhaps, overeducated, so he returned to Mainz in 1818. There, he devoted himself to literary pursuits, which included producing a German translation of the Lay of the Last Minstrel, a long poem by Sir Walter Scott. He initially wrote his poems in Standard German as well as in the Rhenish dialect. In his efforts to reproduce the dialect in detail, he made numerous visits to the rural areas surrounding Mainz, and took meticulous notes when he heard farmers selling their wares at the market near his home. In addition to his poems, he wrote works in the popular \\"Posse mit Gesang\\" (Farce with Singing) genre. His works depict ordinary people, held up to a satirical mirror. Most represent a type known as the \\"Palatinate Farmer\\". His first published work came in 1824 with Etwas zum Lachen (Something to Laugh About), which was first sold anonymously at a local bookstore in Mainz. Later editions carried his name. In January of 1838, he became one of the founders of the . He died later that year, at the age of forty-one, from typhus. His parents' home, where he was born, is still known as the \\"Lennighaus\\". A street has also been named after him. His younger brother, Adam Franz Lennig, was a Catholic theologian and served as a Dean.

It is located on Circle Road, at the west end of the West Campus. The original Kelly Quad consists of five buildings: Dewey College, Baruch College, Eisenhower College, Schick College and Hamilton College. The dormitories were named after John Dewey, Bernard Baruch, Dwight D. Eisenhower, B√©la Schick and Alexander Hamilton. The names of Kelly Quad's buildings were originally given to Stony Brook students to decide, who named them after Harpo Marx, Edgar Allan Poe, Lenny Bruce, Woody Guthrie and John Steinbeck, respectively. However, these names were not approved by the Stony Brook Council or higher administration in Albany. All of Kelly Quad's buildings are in suite style. The Undergraduate College associated with Kelly Quad is Human Development (HDV). Kelly Quad is the site of the newly-reopened West Side Dining facility, which originally opened in 1979 as the Kelly Dining Center before undergoing a $23 million renovation and re-opening in 2014 as a 45,000-square foot facility, the largest dining hall on the Stony Brook campus which serves over 30,000 costumers per week.

Yang, is part of Roosevelt Quad, while Lauterbur Hall, named after Paul Lauterbur, is part of Kelly Quad. The structures are made of bold-colored aluminum, which serve as the exterior cladding of the buildings. The aluminum colors chosen ‚Äì birch, red, orange, white, blue and gray ‚Äì were chosen to brighten the campus, as the architectural firm interviewed Stony Brook students prior to designing the buildings and aimed to fix a common criticism of the campus looking \\"too brown\\" during the winter season. = Toll Drive = The Toll Drive residential halls are a complex consisting of two residence halls, Chavez Hall and Tubman Hall, as well as the connected East Side Dining facility. It opened in 2017 following three years of construction, which cost $124 million; $24 million in state bonds were issued for the project. The development includes 348,000 square feet of living space, which provides an additional 760 beds. This brought the total on-campus housing inventory to 10,300, making Stony Brook University the largest campus housing for any public school in the state of New York. The buildings feature a modern architectural design that feature ironspot brick, cast stone and glass. The buildings were named for Cesar Chavez and Harriet Tubman. The connected East Side Dining center occupies an additional 68,000 square feet and includes 10 mini-restaurants as well as 12 kitchens.

Research and Development Park  Stony Brook University acquired the Research and Development Park in 2005 from the Gyrodyne Company of America through eminent domain. The 246-acre plot of land is located south of the main Stony Brook campus. In 2012, the state of New York paid Gyrodyne a $167.5 million settlement after the company sued over allegations that the state had undervalued the plot of land during the annexation in 2005. Gyrodyne currently still owns 68 acres of land on the site, which are used for office buildings and undeveloped property. Prominent Long Island leaders plan on filling the Research and Development Park with eleven buildings to \\"spark the region‚Äôs economy and fortify the eastern end of a 65-mile 'high-tech highway.'\\" = Center of Excellence in Wireless and Information Technology = The Center of Excellence in Wireless and Information Technology (CEWIT) was the first building to open in the new Research and Development Park; the 100,000-square foot building opened in 2008 and was designed by Mitchell Giurgola.

It was painted in the first quarter of the 17th century. The painting is kept in the Museum of Prado in Madrid. Painting The oeuvre was part of a collection of 26 paintings which arrived in Madrid in the early 17th century. Some of the paintings, hung in the Torre de la Reina at the Alc√°zar de Madrid, showed everyday activities of the people of Flanders; other portrayed the archdukes in their landed estates. There were four paintings in the latter group. To the left there stand the dukes, surrounded by courtladies, children and small sized dogs. To the right there is a group of deer, chased by small sized dogs. The painting seems to represent hunting; however, it does so in a placid, unrealistic way: some deers are resting, and the small sized dogs are not of the breed generally used for hunting. Differently from the Excursion in the Countryside of Infanta Isabel Clara Eugenia, also by Brueghel and de Momper, dating to the same period, part of the same set, and showing the same gardens in the archdukes' residence of Mariemont, the latter's palace is not visible in the background of this painting. A collection of letters between Isabel Clara Eugenia and the Duke of Lerma shows the former's passion for the life in the countryside. This painting was commissioned by the archduke out of her enthusiasm for such places. References Further reading * D√≠az Padr√≥n, Mat√≠as, Museo del Prado: cat√°logo de pinturas.

It differs from traditional management and financial consultancy in that it incorporates election law requirements and the unique requirements of political campaigns.  Background  Prior to 1971, few federal and state election laws necessitated the need for professional accounting services. Accountants‚Äô limited involvement in federal election campaigns began with the passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 which required financial reporting. The Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, with its complex compliance and reporting requirements, created a paradigm shift in the way campaign finances were conducted and expert financial management of political campaigns became an imperative. In 1976, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, identifying the need for increased participation of CPAs in the election process, published in The Journal of Accountancy a cover article entitled ‚ÄúPolitical Campaign Accounting ‚Äì new opportunities for the CPA.‚Äù The article received national and international exposure in both print media and broadcast news. The recognition of political campaign accounting as a professional accounting specialization was expanded when in July, 1976, the AICPA, together with autonomous state CPA organizations, assembled a nationwide network of 600 CPAs to advise local Republican and Democratic presidential campaign organizations on the requirements for financial record-keeping and reporting.

Rhine also served as one of the film's producers and as one of the actors. Synopsis The movie begins with Father Romero exorcising a demon from two men, Lt. Garvan and Martin, by shooting Garvan in the head and killing him. Romero then boards a flight to Vietnam along with several other passengers. Garvan's remains are also on the plane and during the flight his body reanimates, allowing the demon to possess two of the passengers. Romero manages to successfully exorcise the passengers, afterwards telling a Rabbi named Feldman who was aboard the plane that he had served with Garvan during the Vietnam War. The lieutenant had put him in a coma for several years due to Garvan having a mental breakdown and shooting both Romero and a little girl he was trying to exorcise. The demon possesses several others, one of which results in a possessed pregnant woman giving birth to a demon baby that gets flushed down the toilet. Together the priest and rabbi go to the cargo hold to battle Garvan, who manages to escape by overwhelming Romero with visions. Among the chaos Romero discovers that one of the passengers, Amanda, is the sister to the little girl Garvan murdered. He successfully persuades her to assist him and together they convince one of the pilots to fly the plane to 60,000 feet, as this will take them further from Hell and the source of the demon's powers. More deaths and possessions occur but ultimately Romero, Feldman, Amanda, and several other survivors land the plane, only to be met by Garvan's corpse and several other undead, possessed people.

Elements of praise focused on the Richard Band soundtrack and Kim Newman stated that it was \\"almost superfluously excellent\\". HorrorNews.net gave a favorable review for the film, stating that it was \\" that film that cheerfully plays with its audience.

Evangelia inu lystuvi (Gospels and Epistles), 1612, prepared by Tschandek Tschandek was born in Vi≈°nja Gora and attended school in Ljubljana. He became a Jesuit in 1600 and taught at the Jesuit lyceum in Ljubljana. In 1610 he relocated to Graz, where he studied theology until 1612. After completing his studies, he primarily worked in Klagenfurt, Graz, and Ljubljana. Although Lutheranism had mostly been eradicated among the Slovenes by Tschandek's time, the publications created by the Slovene Protestants had nonetheless left an awareness of the need to instruct people in their vernacular language. Tschandek's birthplace in Vi≈°nja Gora The most important religious figure of this era in Slovenian territory was the bishop of Ljubljana, Thomas Chr√∂n. As bishop, he participated in destroying Protestant publications, razing their churches, and expelling Protestants, as well as having their corpses exhumed. Chr√∂n was unable to realize his plan to publish a catechism, a prayer book, and a hymnal, and to establish a press, but he did succeed in having 3,000 copies of the book Evangelia inu lystuvi (Gospels and Epistles) published at his expense in Graz in 1613. This was based on Jurij Dalmatin's Bible translation, but with expressions of foreign origin replaced with Slovene expressions. The work continued the Protestant linguistic heritage in Slovenian territory, and it was later reprinted eight times, always using the language of the Protestant text. In 1615, a Slovene translation of Peter Canisius's Catechismus minor was published in Augsburg (titled Catechi≈ømus Petri Cani≈øij Soc. Iesv Th.

The painting is today considered a collaboration between the latter and Jan Brueghel the Elder. It was painted between 1615 and 1625. The painting is kept in the Museum of Prado in Madrid. Painting The painting depicts a group of villagers engaged in common activities on a winter day. The landscape is clearly in the style of de Momper. The sky is leaden. Some villagers are at work, others are skating over a frozen canal. The perspective is elevated, and the central building in the painting functions as the axis for the houses' distribution in the depicted village. The horizon line is high in the background, where a hilly landscape is depicted. In the foreground, there are the frozen canal with the skaters and a snowy road ending into the right bottom end of the painting. The painting is part of a series treating the four seasons started by de Momper in 1615. The influence of Brueghel the Elder is therefore clear. However, de Momper didn't use allegory and symbolism. He limited himself to the representation of the landscape. The figures in the painting have been attributed to Jan Brueghel the Elder. References Bibliography * Salas, Xavier de, Museo del Prado.

History and mission  The Electrical and Electronics Institute (EEI) was established in July 7th, 1998. The EEI was set up as an autonomous body but is under the supervision of the Ministry of Industry of Thailand (MOI). It is operated as a non-profit organization and receives an investment grant from the Thai government each year. The EEI was established to strengthen the competitiveness of the Thai electrical and electronics industry n international markets. It carries out its mission by coordinating between the private sector and the government. In addition to the MOI, it has shown to have working relationships with The Thai Industrial Standards Insitute (TISI) (which transferred some of its activities to it in 1999), the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI) and The Ministry of Commerce (MOC). In 2005 EEI was involved in the Capacity Building for a Recycling-Based Economy in APEC project. In this project they co-organized a symposium for APEC Capacity Building on a Recycling-based Economy: Guidelines for Thailand where EEI's director, Mr. Charuek Hengrasmee, gave a presentation on Current Status of Recycling in E&E; Industry in Thailand. It was reported on November 8th, 2016 that the EEI, along with the 10 other independent organizations under the Ministry of Industry, were to be tasked to develop key Thai industries. This was part of the Ministry of Industry's proposed plan for a new venture capital fund to support startups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in gaining access to funding. In September 2020, the Bangkok Post reported that the EEI was jointly conducting a study with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the Pollution Control Department, and the Federation of Thai Industries to create a business model for electronic waste management to better cope with the surge of hazardous rubbish in Thailand. The study is expected to take over a year, ending in November of 2021.  Activities  The EEI activities cover the following areas: #Safety testing of electrical and electronics products and parts based on TISI Standards #Compulsory standards testing required by TISI #Voluntary standards testing services to satisfy the demand from the private sector for export, import and manufacturing #CE-Marking Test according to EU Directive The EEI also arranges mutual recognition agreements (MRA) on electrical and electronic products as well as proposes Thai national standards of electrical and electronics products through TISI. The EEI also creates forecasts and other data related reports for Thailand's electrical and electronics (E&E;) industry. Foundation for Industrial Development EEI, along with seven sister institutes, falls under the oversight of the Foundation for Industrial Development (FID), which is sometimes referred to in translation as The Industrial Development Foundation. The Board of Directors of the FID provides oversight to the Board of Directors of the institute. The other institutes under the FID are: *Thai-German Institute (TGI) * Thailand Textile Institute (THTI) * National Food Institute (NFI) *Management System Certification Institute (MASCI) *Thailand Automotive Institute (TAI) * Iron and Steel Institute of Thailand (ISIT) * Plastics Institute of Thailand (PITH) Ministry of Industry Network Industry Network Logo On 1 March 2019, the driving committee of the institutions under the Ministry of Industry aimed to create public awareness of its network of institutions. An Industry Network logo was created to be used in publicizing the mission of the institution networks as a symbol of their cooperation in driving Thailand‚Äôs mission in the digital age.

A pioneer in the study of the cognitive and organizational dynamics at play in innovative enterprises, he is behind the development of several theories aimed at re-establishing management science as a fundamental science of collective action.  Academic career  Armand Hatchuel holds an engineering degree (graduated in 1973) and a PhD in management science from Mines ParisTech (√âc. His academic career has taken place primarily at MinesParisTech and theParis Sciences et Lettres University, first as an assistant lecturer between 1974 and 1985, then as a 2nd class professor beween 1984 and 1994. In 1995 he was promoted 1st class professor and then in 2007 an exceptional class professor(2007). From 1998 to 2010, he was also the deputy director of the Centre for Management Science. In 1995 he created the design engineering programme at MinesParisTech, that he directed up until 2009. In 2009, along with Benoit Weil, he founded and coordinated the Chair of Design Theory and Methods for Innovation. In 2014, he contributed to creating the Chair of Enterprise Theory, Forms of Governance, and Collective Creation, directed by Blanche Segrestin and Kevin Levillain. From 1998 to 2006, Armand Hatchuel was a permanent guest professor at Chalmers University in Gothenburg and at the Stockholm School of Economics, where he participated in the FENIX Programme (business and knowledge creation). CK Theory Hatchuel, along with Benoit Weil invented C-K theory, a design theory that models creative reasoning and which has been behind multiple scientific and industrial breakthroughs.Armand Hatchuel also developed a theory of prescribing relationships to explain collective learning processes and the crises that they encounter in markets and organizations. He unified his work on rationality and the formation of collectives in his axiomatic theory of collective action. This theory clarified the concept of a \\"management rule\\" as an emancipating combination of rationality and responsibility, the history and ancient origins of which the author explored in depth. The results led to a new theory of the enterprise (developed with Blanche Segrestin), which contributed to the enactment of a French law on the enterprise (the Pacte Law of 2019) and, in particular, the establishment of the French soci√©t√© √† mission (profit-with-purpose corporation) status. A chapter of the Palgrave Handbook of Organizational Change Thinkers, as well as a chapter of \\"Les Grands Auteurs en Management de l'innovation et de la cr√©ativit√©\\" are dedicated to his work.

Recently FB4 has been detected in fungi Aspergillus niger and in several Tolypocladium species. FB4 is similar to fumonisin B2 and fumonisin B3 but it is lacking a hydroxy group located gamma- to the amino substituent while lacking two hydroxy groups compared to fumonisin B1. Fumonisin B4 has been first published in 1991. Isomers Several isomers of Fumonisin B4 have been detected. A larger group is the partially hydrolysed form, denoted as PHFB4, which has been detected using HPLC-ITMS. Another significant isomer is the 3-epi-FB4, which has been identified using NMR, it has also been shown that this isomer occur 10-40% of the regular FB4 sample in nature. Toxicity Fumonisin B4 belongs to the class of FB analogues, which is the most significant group from toxicity perspective. Currently Fumonisin B4's toxicity compared to Fumonisin B1 or B2 is unknown as further research is actively ongoing, however in nature its concentration is significantly lower. Fumonisin B4 inhibits sphingosine acyltransferase. Fumonisin B4 and other fumonisins frequently contaminate maize and other crops.

Carlo Semenza‚Äôs research activity mostly contributed to the field of aphasiology, neuropsychology of language, and numerical cognition.  Career  Semenza graduated in medicine at the University of Padua in 1974, and in the same university he obtained his specialization in psychiatry (1978). During his specialization he focused in the growing field of neuropsychology, and in the study on how brain damage could have specific effects on cognition. His interest in neuropsychology flourished during the time spent as a research fellow at the Boston VA Hospital between late 70s and beginning of 80s. During that time interval, he attended some of the seminars by Jerry Fodor, and his view of a modular mind strongly influenced his future work. Semenza‚Äôs work initially spanned from spatial cognition to aphasia, but soon started to focus on specific aspects of language processing as proper name anomia. In his seminal work of 1989 he reported one of the first cases of a patient whose use of common nouns was unimpaired, but selectively could not remember proper names, suggesting that proper nouns have a specific representation in the brain, distinct from the representation of common nouns. His later studies encompass other aspects of language, including semantics and morphology, as well as calculation impairments in patients with neurological diseases. Between the 90s and the first years of 2000s he focused on the study of language and especially on morphology, conducting several studies on the processing of mass and count nouns, and compound words in patients with aphasia or other neurological diseases. Since 2010, his work focused on numerical cognition in neuropsychological conditions. He published several studies underlining the need of better characterising the role of right- hemisphere in numerical processing. and promoted the importance of taking into account the impact of numerical abilities in the activities of daily living in neurological patients Positions  *2008 - 2020.

The protest, which 200 people joined, featured a public speech by Anon Nampa. Paul Chambers, Southeast Asian politics scholar, noted, \\"Such open criticism of Thailand‚Äôs monarch by non-elites at a public place within Thailand with the police simply standing by is the first of its kind in Thai history.\\" On 7th of August, watchdog organisation iLaw launched a petition campaign to gather 50,000 names to amend the whole 2017 Constitution and draft a new constitution by elected constitutional assembly. On August 8th, police received approval from the Bangkok Criminal Court to put prominent human rights lawyer Anon Nampa and democracy activist Panupong Jadnok in pre-trial detention at the Bangkok Remand Prison. They were arrested on 7 August in Bangkok on charges related to their involvement in the ‚ÄúFree Youth‚Äù rally. Reports suggested that police also targeted 31 other people, including many student movement leaders. On 10th August, the Campaigning Group for Constitution of the People submitted a bill paving the way for a constitutional referendum. Meanwhile, there was a counter-protest by the Coordination Centre of Vocational Students for the Protection of National Institutions (CVPI) which accused the protesters of being manipulated to attack the government and the military, as well as criticising the monarchy, with an aim to cause a regime change. The group also vowed to set up their branches in all provinces and use a social pressure approach to dissuade the movement. Later that evening, there was a rally at Thammasat University, Rangsit campus in Pathum Thani Province named \\"‡∏ò‡∏£‡∏£‡∏°‡∏®‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏ï‡∏£‡πå‡∏à‡∏∞‡πÑ‡∏°‡πà‡∏ó‡∏ô\\" (lit.

Totaling about 3,000 people, it was the largest rally in months. It employed the slogan \\"We don't want reforms; we want revolution.\\" A labour union representative also gave a speech on economic inequality and broken promises by the government. Among the events were a speech by Anon Nampa, clips of political exile Pavin Chachavalpongpun, known for his stance on royal reform, and the declaration of ten demands to reform the monarchy under a constitutional monarchy.

Correa was also a member of the Puerto Rico men's national basketball team for many years and participated in a number of international competitions. Basketball career Correa joined the BSN during that league's 1981 season, as a player for the Morovis Titans in the city of Morovis. That year, he played in 31 out of 33 scheduled games, scoring 535 points with 227 rebounds and 73 assists compiled, for averages of 17.3 points, 7.3 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game. In 1982, Correa played only 27 games but scored 493 points for an average of 18.3 points a game, but his averages on two other key departments, rebounds and assists, lowered as he only caught 152 rebounds and assisted 39 times, for averages of 5.6 and 1.4, respectively. 1983 began what was a streak of ten seasons in a row (excluding the 1988 season, see below) for Correa where he scored 20 points per game or more, when he scored 751 points for an average of 22.8 a game, along with 246 rebounds, (7.5 a game) and 59 assists (1.8 a game). During these ten seasons, the Titans became perennial playoff teams in the Puerto Rican league, as Correa was teamed with Mario Butler and Mario Sanchez among others. The 1983 season also marked the first time Correa competed in all 33 season games, the BSN season usually comprising between 30 and 33 games a season only. Next, in 1984, Correa scored 682 points with 201 rebounds and 59 assists, for averages of 23.5, 6.9 and 1.8, respectively. In 1985, Correa scored 615 points and had 180 rebounds with 66 assists, for averages of 21.2, 6.2 and 2.3 in those categories, respectively. Correa's 1986 season saw a dramatic increase in points scored as he surpassed the 800 point mark in one season for the first time in his career as he scored 837 points, to go along with 213 rebounds and 72 assists, solidifying his status as an all star in the Puerto Rican league with averages of 27.9 points, 7.1 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game. 1987 was an even bigger year for Correa, as he scored 892 points, and had 267 rebounds and 97 assists, for averages of 29.7 points, 8.9 rebounds and 3.2 assists a game. That year he, Butler, Sanchez and Grimaldi Vidot led the Titanes to their first and only BSN national championship, when they beat the defending champions Polluelos de Aibonito in seven games at the BSN Finals, with a Game Seven score of 100-92.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qbhdYB932Y In Game Five of that series, Correa gave the Titans a 101-99 win by making a last second, buzzer beating shot as the game was tied at 99, to give the Titanes a 3-2 series lead.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47-PDySssjY&feature;=youtu.be&fbclid;=IwAR0zEusIvUgaPIjijYomYTDBiXy9miqnuR4fGP1UWaHmOQ2hZTP9izV7uG4 Around this era, Correa's name garnered further popularity around Puerto Rico when WAPA-TV's famous announcer, Manolo Rivera Morales, invented a phrase he used sometimes when Correa had the ball on his hands during Titanes televised basketball games, in which Rivera Morales would exclaim \\"Wes! Wes! Wes!\\" as Correa took a shot. The Titanes hoped to repeat as champions during the 1988 BSN season, but largely due to Correa's personal problems, he was suspended for that season (as explained below) and they never won another championship. In 1989, Correa returned to the Titans, surpassing the 900 points mark for the first time, with 926, and contributing 247 rebounds and 57 assists, for averages of 30.9, 8.0 and 1.9 respectively. 1990 saw him score 722 points and grab 203 rebounds while passing for 86 assists in 27 games, for a total of 26.7, 7.5 and 3.2 per game, respectively. The 1991 BSN season saw Correa's scoring climb a bit as he scored 776 points but his numbers otherwise declined as he pulled 174 rebounds (staying short of the 200 rebounds mark for the first time in five seasons) and had 62 assists, 24 less than the year before, achieving averages of 26.8, 6.0 and 2.1, respectively, in 29 games played. 1992 was the first year since 1983 in which Correa played 33 games in a season for the Titanes, and he again surpassed 800 points, scoring 865 with 212 rebounds and 82 assists for averages of 26.2, 6.4 and 2.5 in those categories, but in 1993, at the age of 31 already, his numbers began a steady decline. That season, he had 626 points, 162 rebounds and 63 assists for averages of 20.9, 5.4 and 2.1, while 1994 saw those numbers drop to 546 points and 51 assists, albeit having a climb in rebounds to 185. He averaged 18.2 points, 6.2 rebounds and 1.7 assists a game in 1994. An injury in 1995, however, underlined Correa's career decline, as he was only able to play in 7 games, scoring 89 points with 36 rebounds and 15 assists for averages of 12.7, 5.1 and 2.1. 1996 saw him almost complete the Titans entire season as he participated in 24 games, for 318 points, 167 rebounds and 40 assists, with averages of 13.3, 7.0 and 1.7. Correa announced his retirement as a professional basketball player after the 1996 BSN season but he had a brief return for the 1998 one. In his last campaign with the Titanes, he played 22 games, adding 197 points, 93 rebounds and 23 assists to his career totals, for averages of 9.0 points, 4.2 rebounds and 1 assist per game in his final BSN season. =1988 suspension= Correa was suspended for the entirety of the 1988 BSN season for failing a doping test. He was about to participate with the Puerto Rican men's national basketball team at the 1987 Pan American Games in Indianapolis, Indiana when he was tested and his result came positive for a banned substance. He was also suspended from participating for the 1988 season with the Titanes. Career resume Correa played 441 games during his BSN basketball career, scoring 9,870 points (making him a member of the exclusive, 5,000 plus BSN career points club) with 2,958 rebounds and 938 assists, averaging 22.4 points, 6.7 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game in his career. Also, at 49% of his field goal shots, 40% of his three point shots and 87% of his free throw shots made, Correa was an excellent shooter all around the basketball courts. He was a one time BSN champion, in 1987. =Puerto Rico men's national basketball team= During the mid to late 1980s, Correa was a perennial member of the Puerto Rico men's national basketball team alongside other luminaries such as Federico Lopez, Georgie Torres, Mario Morales, Angelo Cruz and Piculin Ortiz, among others.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4q5cKPn5h0 Correa participated, among other important tournaments, at the 1984 Tournament of the Americas, an Olympics qualifying tournament held in Sao Paulo, Brazil. His team did not advance to the 1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles, California. Later years Late during October of 2018, Correa suffered a tragedy in Long Island, New York when his son, 35 years old Hasson Correa, was murdered by stabbing in an attack in which the former basketball player was also stabbed himself. Correa spent several days recuperating at a New York hospital, and he had no idea about Hasson's fate for several days. Some of his Titanes former teammates raised a number of fundraisers, which included one on the webpage GoFundMe and one organized by Mario Butler and backed by Morovis' mayor Carmen Maldonado Gonz√°lez which was held at a local Morovis basketball court. Correa suffered depression following the murder of his son, as well as physical problems stemming from his own stab wound. Personal Apart from son Hasson, Correa has various other children.

State response and arrests  Thai authorities have summoned university chancellors to order them to prevent students from demanding monarchy reform and to draw up lists of student protest leaders, warning that student demands could lead to violence, specifically referencing the Thammasat University Massacre of student protesters by far-right paramilitary groups and the 1992 Black May massacre by the Thai military. An Isaan Record analysis found that the government response has included force and intimidation, arbitrary detention, arrests and changes, disinformation, the deployment of military Information and Operations (information warfare) units, media censorship, delaying tactics, obfuscation, support for pro-government groups, gaslighting, and negotiation. In late August, it was reported that the Government Public Relations Department of Thailand had released two propaganda videos on YouTube attacking the protesters, leading to a reaction on social media accusing the government office of creating disunity. They were later denied access. The existence of an information warfare unit participating in a cyber campaign against government critics was leaked to the public in late February 2020. General Apirat Kongsompong, the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army, expressed concerns that some students' actions were inclined to l√®se majest√©. He cried while vowing his loyalty to the King. In a Facebook post, Colonel Nutsara Woraphatharathorn, former spokesperson of the Royal Thai Army, dubbed the protesters ‚ÄúMob Mung Ming‚Äù (‡∏°‡πá‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏°‡∏∏‡πâ‡∏á‡∏°‡∏¥‡πâ‡∏á; adorable mob). Her action was widely criticised for being partisan. The term Mob Mung Ming was later used in many protests; one organised by the Seri Thoey group on 25 July also incorporated the term in its event's name. Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, a notable politician from a junior coalition partner, expressed concern about implications for COVID-19 spread whilst signaling that he was neutral about the protestors' demands. Some universities and schools responded by forbidding their staff and students to join the protests and by banning gathering on their grounds, claiming COVID-19 concerns. Satri Phatthalung School in Phatthalung Province was sent a warning by the local police. On 23 July, the dean of Prince of Songkhla University, Pattani Province Campus warned the students not to organise a demonstration on its grounds. The protest, however, went on and called for the dean's resignation in addition to the three demands. On 18 August, a department in the Ministry of Education allowed rallies in its schools, only forbidding outsiders to join. Anon Nampa unwillingly dragged on 7 August. On 7 August, watchdog organization iLaw reported at least 78 incidents of intimidation of protest sympathizers. Anon Nampa (), a leading figure of the protest, was arrested on multiple charges, including sedition,\\"‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏ô‡∏ó‡πå ‡∏ô‡∏≥‡∏†‡∏≤\\" ‡πÇ‡∏î‡∏ô‡∏£‡∏ß‡∏ö‡∏à‡∏±‡∏ö‡πÅ‡∏•‡πâ‡∏ß ‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏∏‡∏¢‡∏á‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏∏‡∏Å‡∏õ‡∏±‡πà‡∏ô Nation TV. 7 August 2020 after giving a public speech calling for monarchy reforms.

The MATTER. 7 August 2020 Another Free Youth leader was also arrested. Amnesty International Thailand released a statement demanding removal of all charges and protection of the right to protest. On 9 August, five youth leaders in Phitsanulok Province were arrested without charge. An unnamed Thai police source reported that they were kept in custody in a Border Patrol Police camp to dissuade a local protest event. One female member said she was approached by the officers at her dormitory. On 14 August, student leader Parit Chiwarak was arrested on the outskirts of Bangkok. Police officers showed an arrest warrant, then carried him into a vehicle. The Asia Times quoted a government official stating that the King was not bothered by the 'children's' protests and that they should be able to express their views. This position may be contradicted by an Al Jazeera article, stating that there were reports that the Thai monarchy has asked Thai media to censor any mention of the ten demands. On 20 August, nine were arrested and later released on bail, including Anon Nampa, who was arrested for the second time. Officers reportedly visited the home of a three-year-old who had displayed a The Hunger Games-style three-finger salute. A police document stating that mobile jamming devices were used on 23 August was leaked to the media. The police confirmed the authenticity. In late August, student groups reported that at least 109 schools had suppressed or intimidated political expression. On 25 August, police arrested four student leaders, Arnon Nampa, Suwanna Tanlek, Parit Chiwarak and Piyarat Jongthep, for multiple charges, including sedition. On 28 August 15 further activists were charged. In early September, the police summonsed the first schoolchild protester for violating the Emergency Decree and the Public Assembly Act. On 24 August, in response to a Thai government order, Facebook blocked access in Thailand to the million-member main Facebook page critical of the monarchy, Royalist Marketplace, administered by self- exiled academic Pavin Chachavalpongpun. Hundreds of thousands had switched to a replacement page within hours, and the site had 900,000 members by 30 August. Facebook is challenging the order in the courts. A few days before a scheduled mass student protest on 19 September, Thammasat University's Faculty of Law stated that state security had asked the university to close on that day. The authorities attempted to block more than 2,200 websites ahead of the 19 September rally. Following the rally, Buddhipongse Punnakanta, Minister of Digital Economy and Society, filed a complaint with police to prosecute Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for failing to delete posts in a timely manner, the first time the Computer Crimes Act has been used against foreign service providers. Prayut blamed the protesters for further damaging the country's economy ahead of the planned 14 October rally. On 16 October, the BBC reported that the Thai government had blocked access to Change.org after a petition calling for Germany to declare the King persona non grata attracted nearly 130,000 signatures. After the declaration of a severe state of emergency, police moved to ban or block independent and critical media under the emergency decree, specifically Prachathai.com, The Reporters, The Standard, and Voice TV, together with the Free Youth movement Facebook page. The Free Youth and the United Front for Thammasat and Demonstration reacted by switching from their Facebook pages to the Telegram messaging app; government critic and former finance minister Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala criticized police actions as regressing to \\"complete dictatorship\\". The police seized books criticizing the monarchy. Ministry of Digital Economy and Society stated it intended to prosecute internet service providers and online platforms which allows prohibited content. It also reported about 320,000 illegal messages. In response, the National Press Council of Thailand, the National Union of Journalists Thailand, the News Broadcasting Council of Thailand, the Online News Providers Association, the Thai Broadcast Journalists Association, and the Thai Journalists Association issued a joint statement opposing media freedom suppression and urged the government not to misuse the law by repressing the media, warning that lack of access to information could cause more people to join the demonstrations and destabilize the political situation, risking violence. Thammasat University's Faculty of Journalism and Mass Communications issued a similar statement, insisting on access to information as a basic right and urging the government to permit the media operate independently.  Support  In August, a Move Forward Party MP stated that some references to the monarchy in the protests (e.g. mockery, sarcastic comments, memes) are inconvenient truths that need attention. He received stark responses from Manager Online and General Apirat Kongsompong, who insisted that some protesters intended to overthrow the monarchy, or had fallen victim to some manipulators with such intent. Two opposition members of parliament displayed the three-finger gesture in parliament to show support for the movements, the first being Move Forward Party MP Yanathicha Buapuean in late August, followed by Pheu Thai Party MP Anudith Nakornthap in early September Also in early September, the leader of the Pheu Thai Party, Sompong Amornwiwat, stated the motion from the opposition coalition to amend Article 256 was aligned with the demands of the protesters, who demanded a new constitution. On 9 September, the leader of the Move Forward Party, Pita Limjaroenrat, stated in parliament that the students in the movements wished to be free of Thailand's bureaucratic and educational systems. Both, he stated, are what prevent Thailand from moving forward because the Thai bureaucracy is inflexible and nepotistic, while the Thai education system is archaic, which results in students being exposed to authoritarianism. Despite threats to their careers, many Thai celebrities have publicly expressed their support for the protesters. Some examples are Thai Miss Universe Maria Poonlertlarp, actress Intira Jaroenpura, popular Thai YouTuber Heart Rocker, film director Songyos Sugmakanan, actor and singer Perawat Sangpotirat, actor Sadanon Durongkaveroj, and blogger Amta Chittasenee. Five members of Thai idol girl group BNK48 have also voiced their support for the movements: 'Music' Praewa Suthamphong, 'Jennis' Jennis Oprasert, 'Khamin' Manipa Roopanya, 'Faii' Sumitra Duangkaew, and 'Kheng' Juthamas Khonta. Regarding comments by Prime Minister Prayut that the student protesters were destroying their future employment opportunities by engaging in political activism, human resource specialist Sophon Phukaoluan countered that only those with political ambition or conflicts of interest would be affected. A group of 147 university faculty members has issued a statement saying the protesters' demand of monarchical reform did not violate the law. The Thai Academic Network for Civil Rights, another group of 358 scholars, has also expressed full support for the protesters. On 14 August, Tuen Mun Community Network has issued Thousands of citizens in Thailand participate in the democratic movement every day. These demonstrators do not want the determination of the totalitarian issue to continue.They deeply sympathize. They also said that Hong Kong and Thailand are both members of the anti-totalitarian \\"Milk Tea Alliance\\" and need to continue to pay attention to each other. On 18 August, UNICEF issued a statement invoking the Convention on the Rights of the Child that called for schools and learning institutions to be safe havens and forums for children's freedom of expression and pointing out that children who are confronted with the law must receive support and experience appropriate juvenile proceedings, \\"without the use of violence, intimidation or threats\\". On 31 August, the Embassy of Sweden in Bangkok voiced support for Thai-Swedish Maria Poonlertlarp for speaking out about democracy and equality. Human rights group Amnesty International condemned the 15 October crackdown, as the protests were \\"overwhelmingly peaceful.\\"  Opposition  State-sponsored organized opposition to the protests emerged in August and included the accusation of a global conspiracy being funded or masterminded by foreign government or NGOs. On 10 August, the Thai Move Institute, which contains members of the People's Democratic Reform Committee, released a diagram of an alleged 'people's revolution network' linking student protests to former Future Forward Party leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit and former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. In the same month, a pro-government Facebook page, 'Thailand Vision', asserted the existence of a 'global conspiracy' with the goal of overthrowing the Thai monarchy, alleged to be orchestrated by Amnesty International, Axel Springer, Bild, Business Insider, the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand, the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, George Soros and the Open Society Foundation, the Heinrich B√∂ll Foundation, Netflix, and many more. Some of its supporters cited support for watchdog organisation iLaw (Internet Law Reform Dialogue)Stated $48,000. See: by the US-based, non- profit, non governmental or quasi-autonomous non-governmental organization the National Endowment for Democracy as 'evidence' of the global conspiracy. On 30 August, approximately 1,000‚Äì1,200 mostly older royalists of the 'Thai Pakdee' (Loyal Thai) group, founded by right-wing politician Warong Dechgitvigrom, rallied in Bangkok and similarly alleged foreign 'interference'. On 31 August, the United States Embassy in Bangkok formally denied allegations of funding any protesters. After the demands on monarchy reform were raised in early August, rightist media and organizations quickly attacked them. A Naewna columnist commented that the call to reform the monarchy is an act of evil, causing disunity, and undermining the monarchy under the disguise of protest against the government and for a constitutional amendment. The columnist also accused Pheu Thai and the former Future Forward Party of manipulating the protesters. Most politicians expressed a negative reaction to the demands, including Sudarat Keyuraphan, an influential Pheu Thai politician. On social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, user accounts, including ones coordinated by the state-sponsored, ultra-royalist, Rubbish Collection Organization, which has been characterized as fascist, accuse the student protesters of being anti-monarchists, rebels, traitors, and human 'garbage'. Opposition to high school students involvement include a minimum of 103 cases of harassment of students. Some online insults attacking female child protesters went so far as to urging their rape. In mid-September, the Bad Students group tweeted that some of its members had encountered family and financial problems for participating in the protests. Phumiwat Raengkasiwit (‡∏†‡∏π‡∏°‡∏¥‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏í‡∏ô‡πå ‡πÅ‡∏£‡∏á‡∏Å‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏ß‡∏¥‡∏ó‡∏¢‡πå), an activist from the group Nawachiwin who had begun a hunger strike on 23 July in front of Sappaya-Sapasathan, the meeting place of the Thai parliament, to emphasize the extreme poverty due to COVID-19 mismanagement. However, on 18 August, it was reported that he had distanced himself from the Free Youth movement, accusing the protesters of foreign government and NGO support, while he himself was accused of being a police informer. Many groups and individuals have condemned the protesting tactics, and some considered a protester's act of hurling paint at police officers to be violent. Opponents also find vulgar language used by protest leaders unacceptable. On 16 September, Thailand's Constitutional Court accepted a complaint of treason against three leaders of the 10 August demonstration at Thammasat University filed by Nattaporn Toprayoon, an ultra-royalist. On 17 September, a small group of pro-government protesters came to the Thai Summit Building (office of Thanathorn's family business) claiming that Thanathorn was behind the protests.

Since the amino acid substitution can occur at different positions of the Œ≤-globin chain of the protein, there are several variants. In hemoglobin O-Arab (HbO-Arab) substitution occurs at position 121, while in hemoglobin O-Padova (HbO-Padova) it is at 11 position, and in hemoglobin O Indonesia (HbOIna) it is at 116. HbO is usually harmless unlike other hemoglobin variants such as HbS and thalassemias, even under combination with these abnormal hemoglobins. Hemoglobin O-Padova is the most severe form and is associated with disease of the RBCs and spleen.  Discovery  Hemoglobin O Indonesia is the first discovered HbO. Lie-Injo Luan Eng at the University of Indonesia, Djakarta, was the first to notice the abnormal hemoglobin in 1956 among the Buginese people of Sulawesi Island in Indonesia. It was found among normal hemoblobin (HbA) of the blood samples but different under electrophoresis. It also showed different characters form HbS and HbC, and did not cause sickling of RBCs. The discovery went unnoticed as he later remarked, \\"This report, however, did not attract any attention as it was written in the Indonesian language.\\" He again reported his observation in The Lancet the next year. After consulting Hermann Lehmann at the St Bartholomew‚Äôs Hospital in London and T.H.J. Huisman at the State University of Groningen in the Netherlands, and letting experimentally verified by Harvey Itano at the California Institute of Technology, he was convinced that his discovery was a new type of hemoglobin. He gave the name \\"hemoglobin Buginese X\\" as he reported in The British Medical Journal in 1958, concluding: > As it has been confirmed by different laboratories that Buginese X differs > from all other known haemoglobins, it should be allotted a letter. N was the > letter most recently used to designate haemoglobin Liberian I (personal > communication by Dr. James V. Neel). So far as we know, the letter 0 has not > yet been used, and therefore Buginese X should be called Hb 0. Dr. James V. > Neel agreed with this choice. The same hemoglobin type was found in Iran in 1973. It was found that the protein modification was at position 116 where lysine was present in place of glutamic acid. In 1978, a similar case was reported from Italy. The hemoglobin was eventually named hemoglobin O Indonesia. In 1960, a different but related hemoglobin was found from an 8-year-old Arab boy at Jisr az-Zarqa in Israel. As the boy had severe pneumonia and blood abnormality (hemoglobinopathy) including sickled RBCs. His Hemoglobin was different from HbC and HbS and was designated as hemoglobin O (HbO). On investigating his family, his father was found to be the HbO carrier (i.e. heterozygous HbA/HbO) while her mother HbS carrier. Out of the six siblings, three had no HbO (though one has HbS), one had a heterozygous HbO. The boy and his older sister were diagnosed with sickle cell disease due to inherited HbS/HbO combination. It was later found that the amino acid replacement is at position 121 of the hemoglobin. The hemoglobin is now known as hemoglobin O-Arab. In 1974, another abnormal hemoglobin which they called hemoglobin O-Padova was identified from an Italian woman in Padova. It showed glutamic acid to lysine substitution at position 11. The woman was suffering from a complicated blood conditions. The mother and one of the two children indicated the same hemoglobin but without any symptom.  Disease  Hemoglobin O Indonesia is mostly harmless. But some individuals may indicate mild anemia. Even under heterozygous condition such as with HbD , no serious symptom is observed. With HbS, there can be mild sickle cell trait but no symptoms. Hemoglobin O-Arab causes sickle cell disease in heterozygous (HbS/HbO) individuals. However, the symptomatic anemia is mild and is not life threatening. It is even milder than in heterozygous sickle cell trait (HbS/HbA). A case of sickle cell retinopathy is documented. Under homozygous condition, it is also linked with jaundice (conjugated hyperbilirubinemia), and mild anemia. Hemoglobin O-Padova in homozygous condition is associated with complex genetic and physiological anomalies. In the fist woman diagnosed, severe RBC damage (dyserythropoietic anemia) , enlargement of spleen (splenomegaly), and abnormal RBC (hereditary erythroblastic multinuclearity). But heterozygous condition is clinically harmless.

It separates Ayon Island from the mainland (Kyttyk Peninsula). It belongs to the jurisdiction of the Chaunsky District of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of Russia. Geography The relatively large island of Mosey is located in the eastern part of the strait. The shores of the strait are low (in the southwestern part they are steep in places), with extensive silty drylands and sandy spits. The coastal part of the Ayon Peninsula abounds in many thermokarst brackish-water lakes and halophytic marches in the interlakes. A huge number of bones of Middle Pleistocene animals were found in the steep banks of the strait. Historical background The first Russian navigator to cross the strait was Nikita Shalaurov in 1761 on the way back of his expedition in search of a strait to the Pacific Ocean. There is evidence that with distant southerly winds, when the strait became very shallow, the Chukchi crossed it on foot from the mainland to the Aion Island. Hydronym Until the 19th century, the Maly Chaunsky Strait had the Russian name Travyanaya duct, which is associated with the erroneous assumption that later turned out to be that the bottom of the strait was overgrown with grass. The outdated Chukchi name is Ayoka-Pelintkir, the modern one is Ayopelgykytryn (‚ÄúAion's neck at the spit‚Äù).–¢–∞–º –∂–µ, —Å—Ç—Ä 58. Flora and fauna Brown algae grow in the northern part of the strait. The water area of the strait is inhabited by pink salmon and chum salmon, anadromous loach, and capelin. The Maly Chaunsky Strait is the site of the Siberian eider. Minerals There are cassiterite deposits at the bottom of the Maly Chaunsky Strait. In Soviet times, a project was proposed to block the strait with a dam followed by drainage in order to organize the extraction of tin.

Biography  Hedwig Klein was born in Antwerp to Abraham Wolff Klein, a Hungarian oil wholesaler, and his wife Recha. She was the couple's second daughter. In 1914, the family moved to Hamburg.Emilie Said-Ruete: An Arabian Princess Between Two Worlds. BRILL, 1993, , S. 134 ().Freimark, Promotion Hedwig Klein, S. 851. Two years later, her father was killed in combat on the Eastern Front (World War I) during World War I. In January 1927, Hedwig Klein, her mother, and her sister, who was about a year older than Hedwig, became naturalized German citizens. Hedwig studied at the Jewish Girls School in Hamburg until 1928, when she joined the Lichtwarkschule. It was here that she completed her Abitur in 1931Ursel Hochmuth: Lichtwarkschule/Lichtwarksch√ºler: ¬ªHitler f√ºhrt ins Verderben - Gr√º√üt nicht!¬´, in: Ursel Hochmuth/Hans-Peter de Lorent (Hg.): Hamburg: Schule unterm Hakenkreuz, Beitr√§ge der ¬ªHamburger Lehrerzeitung¬´ (Organ der GEW) und der Landesgeschichtskommission der VVN/Bund der Antifaschisten, Hamburger Lehrerzeitung, Hamburg, 1985, S. 97 and in the same year, she enrolled in the University of Hamburg to study Islamic studies, Semitic studies, and English philology. According to , who would later become a professor of Arabic, university teachers at the time were liberal and open-minded people, for whom anti-semitic views were beyond the pale. For that reason, Klein felt \\"safe\\" in her academic department. Dietrich said of Klein that she was: In 1937, Klein completed her PhD dissertation, entitled Geschichte der Leute von 'OmƒÅn von ihrer Annahme des Islam bis zu ihrem Dissensus, which was a critical edition of an Arabic manuscript concerning early Islamic history. She was not initially awarded the PhD because of her Jewish background, so she wrote to the sinologist Fritz J√§ger, who was dean of the School of Philosophy, mentioning, among other things, that her father had been killed in the war. She was \\"admitted to the degree exceptionally\\". Her PhD dissertation received the distinction of summa cum laude. Her PhD supervisor Rudolf Strothmann called her dissertation \\"a worthy contribution to Islamic Studies\\", and his colleague Arthur Schaade remarked that Klein's work was \\"so diligent and brilliant that it made one wish some older Arabists could live up to it.\\"Freimark, Promotion Hedwig Klein, p. 852. Klein also passed the Rigorosum with the mark of \\"excellent\\". After consulting with the authorities, J√§ger refused to grant the necessary approval to confirm Klein's doctoral degree, claiming that \\"the situation was deteriorating\\". Freimark, Promotion Hedwig Klein, p. 853. This was shortly before Kristallnacht. Klein decided to leave Germany. Freimark writes, \\"When she was in a desperate situation, Hedwig Klein received help and support from a man, whose effective and courageous efforts deserve praise and have not yet been recognized.\\"Freimark, Promotion Hedwig Klein, p. 854. The geographer Carl Rathjens arranged for Klein to receive a job offer in India. She left Hamburg aboard the ship Rauenfels on 19 August 1939. On 21 August 1939, she sent Rathjens a postcard from Antwerp on which she wrote: \\"In this pleasant weather, I'm feeling good on board the ship and I'm not worried about the future at this moment. No doubt, Allah will help me. I've believed that ever since I had the fortune to meet one of His friends.‚Äú The ship was already running two days late when it made a four-day stopover in Antwerp. Because of the threat of war breaking out, the ship was ordered back to Hamburg. As Freimark writes, \\"The race to escape [‚Ä¶] was lost.\\"Freimark, Promotion Hedwig Klein, pp. 854/855. Klein returned to her family in Hamburg, where she lived through \\"all the torture\\", as Carl Rathjens would later describe it, from having to wear the Judenstern to being forced out of her family apartment into a lodging for Jews (Judenhaus). Rathjens himself spent a month in the Fuhlsb√ºttel camp in what was called \\"Protective Custody\\". Arthur Schaade put Klein in contact with Hans Wehr, who was working on a dictionary of contemporary Arabic (Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic). The main purpose of this dictionary was to be \\"to translate Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf into Arabic in order to gain the Arab peoples as allies.\\" Klein reviewed contemporary works of Arabic literature for the dictionary. She wrote out slips of paper with the meanings of words and sent these to the editorial staff. She received 10 Pfennigs for each slip of paper. Wehr's staff praised the \\"exceptional quality\\" of Klein's contributions. \\"Of course, it is simply unimaginable that she will ever receive credit for her contribution\\", wrote one member of the staff to Arthur Schaade on 8 August 1941. Her work on the Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic saved Klein from a scheduled deportation to Riga in December 1941. Schaade had already written to Nazi officials that \\"The Wehrmacht and the Kriegspropaganda were highly interested in seeing the work completed\\" and that Klein was \\"highly qualified\\" for the work and that \\"the number of available Aryan employees was limited.\\" Klein's sister Therese was deported to Riga on 6 December 1941 where she was murdered.Freimark, Promotion Hedwig Klein, p. 856. Despite Schaade's intervention, Hedwig Klein was deported on 11 July 1942 on the first train that left Hamburg for Auschwitz. Her mother was sent to Theresienstadt four days later. Like her daughter Hedwig, she is considered to have died (\\"verschollen\\")) in Auschwitz. Hedwig Klein's grandmother died at Theresienstadt in November 1943. Freimark, Promotion Hedwig Klein, p. 857. After Hedwig Klein was deported, Schaade did not give up. In October 1942, he asked his Arabist colleague Adolf Grohmann, who was based in Leitmeritz, to search for the young woman and to hire her as an assistant. Grohmann, who was a party loyalist, provided no help.Ellinger, Deutsche Orientalistik, p. 70. Grohmann did not think \\"that further work for the named person was any longer an option, if only on the grounds of prestige\\", as he wrote to Schaade on a postcard that bore the imprint \\"Heil Hitler\\". After 1945, Schaade and Rathjens continued their attempts to understand what had happened to Hedwig Klein. At the end of 1945, Rathjens told his former neighbor, the theologian Walter Windfuhr, that, \\"It is 100% certain that the first transport [on which Hedwig Klein was deported] was sent directly to Auschwitz. And it was also sent directly to the gas ovens. [...] Just thinking about it makes me weep and fills me with hatred toward the Nazis.\\" Schaade complained in a letter to one of the staff on the Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic that he had \\"frequently encouraged Hedwig Klein for some time\\" to complete her PhD dissertation and emigrate in good time. In the few surviving letters written by Hedwig Klein, she connects the issue of emigration to scholarly activity in her discipline, which is why she did not want to emigrate to the United States. According to Freimark, because of Klein's \\"sheltered lifestyle\\" she was apparently unable to imagine \\"the extent and scope of the barbarism\\" and the existential threat that she faced.Freimark, Promotion Hedwig Klein, pp. 858f.  Legacy  In order to exonerate himself, Hans Wehr claimed in his De-Nazification after 1945 that he had been able to save \\"Miss Dr Klein from Hamburg\\" from deportation by recruiting her for \\"work that was critical to the war effort\\", i.e. the Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic. When the dictionary was published in 1952, Wehr thanked \\"Miss Dr Klein\\" for her contribution in the foreword, but he did not mention what happened to her. The fifth edition of the Dictionary was published in 2011 and it, too, failed to include any mention of Klein's murder. \\"In an act of remembrance that was uncharacteristic for its time\\", Carl Rathjens petitioned the Amtsgericht Hamburg in the summer of 1947 to appoint him to be Hedwig Klein's representative in absentia (Abwesenheitspfleger). He had 56 copies of Klein's PhD dissertation printed and on 15 August 1947, Klein was offically declared a Doctor of Philosophy. In 1951, through Carl Rathjens's efforts, she was declared dead.Freimark, Promotion Hedwig Klein, S. 858. On 22 April 2010, Stolpersteine bearing the names of Hedwig Klein and other murdered Jewish academics were placed outside the main buildings of the University of Hamburg. Another Stolperstein bearing her name was placed outside her last known address in the Harvestehude district of Hamburg.

Description \\"Psychropotidae are elongate in shape, with the anterior part of the dorsal surface depressed. Many psychropotids have a large posterior appendage. They usually have 10-20 tentacles and ventrolateral radii, each with a single row of many small tube feet.\\" Like all holothurians, psychropotids have calcareous deposits, vestigial elements of the usual Echinoderm skeleton. \\"In psychropotids, These are essentially similar to other Holothuroidea, differing in a very low degree of calcification\\", instead consisting mainly of connective tissue.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313037809_Parallelisms_in_the_Evolution_of_Sea_Cucumbers_Echinodermata_Holothuroidea. The calcareous ring and spicules of Holothuroidea are useful in determining phylogeny, as they vary greatly and are believed to have evolved independently as species adapted to various biotopes. In psychropotidae there are usually four armed spicules with arms projecting inward and a single large central process projecting outwards. The calcareous ring is incomplete and has 5 independent parts.Llano, G. A., Schmitt, W. L. (1967). Biology of the Antarctic Seas III.

Behavior All psychropotidae can swim short distances, yet certain species, such as Psychropotes longicauda spend much of their juvenile phase in the pelagic zone.Echinodermata. (2020). United States: CRC Press. \\"Mortensen, 1927, speculated that 'The long tail probably is a swimming apparatus\\"; his suggestion is apparently true for juveniles of this species, but not for adults\\"Miller, J. E., Pawson, D. L. \\"Swimming Sea Cucumbers (Echinodermata: Holothuroidea): A Survey, with Analysis of Swimming Behavior in Four Bathyal Species\\", Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington D.C.. Several authors describe the ability of a number of Psychropotes species to use a large, unpaired dorsal appendage as a 'sail' to move with the prevailing current, contorting their body so as to steer their movement. The great variation of this appendage throughout the Holothuroid family suggests that this adaptation is significant in allowing species to access food sources in the food-scarce environments in which they live. Echinoderm Research 1995. (1995). Netherlands: Taylor & Francis. \\"Ostergren (1938) noted that most species in the Family Psychropotidae and some synallactids such as genus Paelopatides are darker in color ventrally than dorsally. He suggested that the differing colors may conceal swimming animals from predators above and below.\\" Taxonomy Using traditional taxonomic methods, Psychropotidae have been placed in the same taxon as the family Deimatidae. Recent molecular phylogenetic data, however, has suggested that the taxon is polyphyletic, with Deimatidae separated from all other Elasipoda families. Miller, A. K., Kerr, A.

It was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1926. Overview The carving is an outline of a seated Buddha engraved on a sheer rock wall of quartz trachyte on the left bank of the upper stream of the Kinu River. The engraving has a height of 18.2 meters from the top of the crown to the lower end of the lotus throne, the face length is about 3 meters and a width of about 1.6 meters. The lotus seat is depicted with eight leaves. The carving is faint and partially obliterated due to long-term weathering, erosion, and moss adhesion, but the thickness of the engraved line is about 4.5 to 6.1 centimeters. There are various theories as to when this carving was created, ranging from the Nara period, Heian period and Kamakura period. From its style, art historians tend to lean towards the late Heian to early Kamakura hypothesis; however, per local folklore, the image was carved in one night by the famous K≈çb≈ç Daishi in 807 AD at the request of Fujiwara no Tomitada, a nobleman who was governor of Sanuki Province in Shikoku, shortly after K≈çb≈ç Daishi's return from Tang Dynasty China There is no documentary evidence to back up any of these theories. The mountain on which the image is carved is called the and contains a cave with a statue of Kannon Bosatsu, which was once part of a Buddhist temple complex. However, the temple was destroyed after the Meiji restoration and the carving was abandoned. The cave-temple was opened in 2015 for the first time in 136 years.

The structure, which is grade II* listed, is dated to the 12th century, replacing an earlier building on the same site. The church is noted for being the supposed baptismal location of Grace Pace, Captain Cook's mother. Historically the church was known as St Mary's, but was rededicated to St Peter ad Vincula after an early twentieth century renovation. It is sometimes referred to as the Old Church of St Peter, as the newer development of South Stockton, later known as Thornaby-on-Tees, had a new church built to accommodate its growing population. History The Domesday Book states that Thornaby had a church in 1086, however, the current structure has been dated to the 12th century. Originally dedicated to St Mary Magdalen(e), it was rededicated as St Peter ad Vincula (St Peter in Chains) after the basilica of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome. The rededication occurred in 1908, just after it underwent a major renovation. In 1495, when the church was dedicated to St Mary Magdalene, the church was tied to the priory at Guisborough. The income from the church and that of an agricultural cottage and land nearby, paid for the five lamps that lit the church and the surrounding green. The five lamps were placed there to light a shrine to St Mary (the dedication) by Robert de Thormodbi, who suffered a severe wounding during a Crusade encounter at Acre in the 13th century. de Thormodbi swore that if he survived his wounding, he would build a shrine to St Mary. The church is located on high ground just east of the River Tees and formed part of the ancient village of Thornaby, on what is now Thornaby Green. The old village of Thornaby, was centred around the church, supposedly the oldest building in the area, and a few houses built around it, with a long village green. The industrialisation on the Tees meant a newer settlement (originally called South Stockton), developed further north but on the south side of the river. This led to another church being built in Thornaby-on-Tees (as South Stockton was later rechristened), as the Church of St Peter could only seat 80 people. St Peter's was historically described as being a chapel, or a chapel of ease as it was often within another parish. A prevailing local legend states that Grace Pace, the mother of Captain Cook, was baptised in the church. Whilst it its known that she was born and lived in what was the village of Thornaby, some have pointed out that at the time of her baptism, (), the church was not the mother building in the parish and most likely, baptisms, marriages and funerals were held elsewhere. However, the church retains an original Norman font, so baptisms are assumed to have been undertaken at some point in the history of the church. Originally in the parish of Stainton, the church became the mother church of its own parish (Thornaby-on-Tees) in 1844, but this was quite short, as by 1858, St Pauls church in Thornaby became the mother church for the parish. In 1869, the graveyard was officially opened (the earliest listed burial being 1746), only to close to burials in 1870. However, burials still continued of those who had close relatives interred in the churchyard, so that they \\"might have the privilege of being buried there on their decease [sic].\\" Some burials are listed for St Peter's up to 1905. In the 1970s, the lych gate was removed and the area around the church was landscaped which removed most of the headstones to the edges of the churchyard. Architecture The original design of the building was in the Norman Romanesque style, and the church itself consists of one single room, in length by . The thickness of the outer walls vary from side to side, though some do hold evidence of pre-conquest architecture. Some of the stones in the south wall show evidence of re-use; at least two have dials cut into them representing twenty-four hours. The two buttresses on the east facing wall, were added in the 15th century when the church was renovated, with a bellcote, situated at the west end of the church, dating from around the same time. Internally, the design of the columns and the roof has crossed leaves, something which is rare in North Yorkshire, being recognised in only one other church in the area, that at St Wilfrid in South Stainley. Some of the supporting columns have been dated to the 12th century. A chancel is known to have been on the eastern end of the church, but this was removed at some unknown date, and the access arch through the east side was walled up. The pantile roof is modern, the original being installed (), but a more modern roof was installed . A new roof is being installed over 2020 and 2021 with Welsh slate. A plaque dedicated to No. 608 Squadron RAF, who were formed at RAF Thornaby in 1930, is affixed to one of the church's walls. Parish The current incumbent of the church is the Reverend Robert Anthony Desics, who was appointed in March 2020. Previously, the church (and parish) were located in the Deanery of Cleveland. It is now in the Deanery of Middlesbrough, the Archdeaconry of Cleveland, and the Diocese of York.

Major features of the park include a reservoir, various decorative trees, wetlands, several footbridges, and an observatory. Description The Nogiwa Park Observatory Nogiwa Park is adjacent to National Route 280 to the east and Aomori Prefecture Route 26 to the south in the district of Hajiro in western Aomori. It is roughly southwest of Aburakawa Station on the Tsugaru Line. The land to the north of the park is primarily made up of paddy fields. The western side of the park is made up of hilly terrain that marks the eastern edge of the foothills of the Tsugaru Mountains. The central feature of Nogiwa Park is Nogiwa Lake, a reservoir built in the 17th century, where recreational fishing is permitted. A wooden observatory tower is placed in the northwestern corner of the park where it affords a view of the lake that largely surrounds it. Four footbridges carry the park's pathways over sections of Nogiwa Lake: Nogiwa Sansaku-hashi, Koj≈ç ≈åhashi, Mikaeri-hashi, and K≈çun-hashi. The rest of the park is forested with decorative trees including black and red pines, weeping willow, and Yoshino cherry. The park's cherry trees are an attraction at its Aomori Spring Festival. History The date of Nogiwa Park's creation is unknown, but the reservoir it is centered on, Lake Nogiwa, was built in the late 17th century in the former village of Hajiro. It is likely that Lake Nogiwa is the oldest reservoir in the city of Aomori. The lake was used in a fish farm project to celebrate the arrival of Crown Prince Yoshihito in the region in September 1908. The lake functioned as a public source of water and ice until 1945. Due to the 1945 wartime expansion of Aomori Airfield, a private airstrip that once existed near the park, the , was moved into what is currently part of Nogiwa Park. The railway was located on the northeastern shore of Lake Nogiwa where a road through the park exists currently. After the end of World War II, the park was used as a site for spring festivals, and fishing tournaments began to be held at Lake Nogiwa. The Tsugaru Logging Railway was closed in 1967 and in 1972 planning for the improvement of the park by the city of Aomori began. Projects to improve the park began the next year. Tree planting events were held every May from 1985 to 1988 to develop a forest within the park.

Biography In 1875, Josep Negre i Oliveras was born in the Valencian town of Lludient. He settled in Barcelona, where he worked as a typographer and in 1907 participated in the founding of Solidaritat Obrera. In 1908, along with Tom√°s Herreros Miguel, he took part in the eight-month strike against the Radical Republican Party's newspaper El Progreso. He was also a member of the strike committee formed during the Tragic Week of 1909. During the founding congress of the National Confederation of Labor (, CNT), on November 19, 1910, Negre i Oliveras was elected as the union's first General Secretary. In 1911, he was arrested and imprisoned for participating in a strike in solidarity with the miners of Euskadi. After his release, in 1913 he attended the First International Syndicalist Congress, held in London from 27 September to 2 October, where he made his speech in Valencian. The 1914 he was part of a clandestine commission of the Regional Confederation of Labor of Catalunya (, CRTC), which tried to reorganize the CNT. In 1916 he became the editor and director of the CNT's newspaper Solidaridad Obrera, but he left active militancy in 1917 after Salvador Segu√≠ i Rubinat, Salvador Quemades and Manuel Buenacasa Tomeo publicly accused him of being sympathetic to the Central Powers and of associating with the German embassy. However, by the time the Barcelona Traction strike began, he had already returned to the CNT's propaganda apparatus, and for that reason in 1919 he ended up imprisoned in the Pelayo, in the port of Barcelona. During the Spanish Civil War he collaborated in propaganda campaigns of the Union of Iron and Steel Industries, and at the end of the conflict he went into exile in France. Here he was interned in the Argel√®s-sur-Mer concentration camp, where he died. His family was cared for by his friend, the French anarchist Maxime Matt√©i.  Works  * ¬øQu√© es el sindicalismo?

History and description The stone-cornered red brick church, dedicated to Saint Nicholas (), lies on a hill outside of town and dates to the 13th century under Byzantine rule. Including a nave and narthex, the church once featured a barrel vault typical of Orthodox buildings. Over the centuries, the dome collapsed and was replaced by a wood-tile roof. Also gone are the main portico once on the western side as well as the smaller ones facing north and south, leaving only the foundations and some antique capitals of the Doric order. As is common in the Fier region, stones, columns, and inscriptions were taken from ancient ruins in Apollonia and elsewhere nearby to build the church. The floor is stone tile, and three apses remain, a large one facing east and two small ones facing north and south. The arch over the southern gate shows Romanesque influence, courtesy of occupation by the Kingdom of Sicily from the 11th century to the 14th century. Influenced by the reburial of Saint Nicholas by Urso, the Archbishop of Bari Urso, in Bari in 1089 (after the destruction in 1034 of the church where he was buried in his hometown of Myra), the Normans built churches to him extensively including the one in Kurjan. Occupying Normans during the Byzantine‚ÄìNorman wars extensively patronized the local churches, including Our Lady of Apollonia just west of Kurjan, featuring a Romanesque portico dating to the time of Robert Guiscard. In 1956, students from the University of Tirana discovered a 1576 fresco by icon painter Nikolla, son of Onufri, and his apprentice Joan. According to scholar Theofan Popa‚Äôs 1999 work Mbishkrime t√´ kishave t√´ shqip√´ris√´ (‚ÄúInscriptions of the Churches of Albania‚Äù): The text in Medieval Greek was a prayer to the parish priest: ‚ÄúWhen you raise your hands before God, priest, remember me with Joni and Nikolla.‚Äù The discovery earned the church its status as a cultural heritage monument in 1963. In Viktori Puzanova and Dhorka Dhamo‚Äôs article, \\"Disa tipare t√´ piktur√´s monumentale n√´ Shqip√´ri gjat√´ shekujve XII-XV\\" (‚ÄúSome features of monumental icons in Albania in the 12 to 14th centuries‚Äù), published in the second issue of Studime Historike in 1967, they wrote the following: The early frescoes of the Kurjan church belong to the Byzantine style, but include some local elements. This is seen in elements such as the small proportions and ornamental motifs in the blessing of Mary of Egypt by Zosimas of Palestine.

A systematic review found that more severe cases of depression and high levels of hopelessness indicate greater risk for suicide. Other factors identified with increased suicide risk include being of the male gender, having a family history of mental illness and/or suicide, having previously attempted suicide and/or engaged in self-harming behaviors, having comorbid mental disorders, having been recently released from inpatient care for mental health, and being in the period just prior to beginning and/or just following initiation of antidepressant treatment or psychotherapy. Employment status, physical illness, major life events, recent exposure to suicidal acts, and access to means are also known factors to generally increase the risk for suicide. = Methods = Despite the variation in suicide methods used across countries and between cultures, common methods identified include the use of firearms, poison by drugs, poison by pesticides, jumping from heights, hanging, and suffocation. Prevalence of pesticide suicide has been shown to be higher in Asian countries, whereas suicide by firearms is more prevalent in the United States and some European countries where ownership of firearms is common within the home. = Impact on families = Research has given particular consideration to the impacts of suicide within a family, whether by spouse, parent, or child. However, most studies have not examined the quality of the relationships within the family or the effect of different family members‚Äô reactions on the others. Suicide by a spouse has been associated with greater risk for mental illness, including depression, PTSD, and engagement in self- harming behaviors. Spousal suicide has also been associated with adverse changes in physical health and social functioning, mortality, increased risk of suicide, and increased utilization of mental health services. Changes in family dynamics and functioning has been reported in the context of suicide by a child, which researchers note may affect relationships and bonding with surviving children within a family. More extreme types of family functioning with regard to cohesion and adaptability were associated with greater susceptibility to stress related to the death of a child such as the anniversary of one‚Äôs birth and death and decisions regarding one‚Äôs belongings. Many families must also navigate other stressors such as addressing the needs of surviving children and family members, which researchers assert can place the family at risk for additional health implications. Increases in utilization of mental health services and risk of suicide in parents has also been linked to experiencing suicide of a child. Studies have also shown the experience of a suicide or suicide attempt within a family is associated with greater engagement in risky behaviors in adolescents such as substance use, self-harm, and one‚Äôs own suicidal ideation and attempts, and higher rates of depression in suicide-bereaved children relative to their non-suicide-bereaved counterparts. Children of parents who have attempted suicide are at six times greater risk for attempting themselves . Although most suicides and suicidal behaviors within the family occur in the context of mood disorders transmitted within the family, mood disorders do not account for the totality of this phenomenon. Studies show increased risk for suicide and suicidal behaviors remain evident, despite familial transmission of mental illness. = Implications = Exposure to suicide increases risk for mental illness and subsequent suicides. Prevention efforts have focused on identifying at-risk groups. Suicide researchers have suggested providers monitor individuals' impulsivity, hopelessness, and access to means to increase prevention of suicidal acts. Detection and management of mental illness has also been suggested to be an effective method aimed at reducing rates of suicide. In the context of exposure to suicide within a family, researchers have suggested providers aim to improve family functioning and responsiveness to suicide- related stressors and advocate for families‚Äô mental health care and access to other services when indicated.  Trauma  Psychological trauma often occurs when an individual faces an extensive degree of stress in which they are unable to cope with, resulting in difficulties processing and integrating the stressful event. Definitions of trauma have been extended over the past few decades to include a wider range of traumatic experiences including the sudden or unexpected death of a close other (e.g., suicide). More recent definitions of trauma have also evolved such that greater emphasis is placed on the individual‚Äôs perceptions of the traumatic event as opposed to its objective features, giving rise to the notion that similar events can lead to grossly different outcomes across individuals. Despite high rates of exposure to trauma, only a small percentage of those exposed go on to develop clinically significant PTSD symptoms, achieving criteria for a full-blown disorder. However, studies have demonstrated a connection between exposure to traumatic events and negative mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, substance use, and other externalizing disorders. = Repercussions = While the act of suicide itself is often an independent act, suicide has the ability to affect broader social networks such as family, friends, and the community and can be experienced as traumatic. Exposure to violent deaths, such as suicide, have been associated with grief and trauma, and traumatic events as such may create a greater risk for the development of post-traumatic stress disorder. Consideration has also been given to the impact of client suicide on providers such as mental health professionals. A review of 57 studies revealed that the nature of the relationship between the departed and the surviving individual or individuals is associated with the adverse outcomes in the surviving‚Äôs mental and social health.

The mission of the archive is to preserve rural African American history in Georgia. The archive is located in a historic home built by T.A. Bryant, Sr., and was donated in 2005, by Rev. T.A. Bryant, Jr. and his sister, Zudia Guthrie, to preserve and store all the Flat Rock records and documents. It was established as a museum and resource to genealogical and historic research, as well as a heritage tourism site. The Flat Rock Archives consists of a variety of historic sites including the Flat Rock African American Historic Cemetery. All of these sites are located within the Arabia Mountain National Heritage Area. thumb  History  Since 1981, after a childhood of listening to the stories of his elders, Flat Rock native, Johnny Waits developed a vision to preserve the African-American history of the Flat Rock community. In December 2006, the Flat Rock Archives opened to the public. The co-founders of the archive is T.A. Bryant, Jr., Vera Whitaker, and Johnny Waits. Johnny Waits is the current President of the archive. In 2006, the Flat Rock Archives was part of a segment on African American Lives, episode \\"Listening to our Past\\" featuring Chris Tucker..  The Flat Rock Archives Goal of Preserving Memories  One goal of the Flat Rock Archives is to preserve the memories of the Flat Rock community. President of the archive, Johnny Waits wants the sounds, memories, and stories to be preserved and heard for generations to come. In an Atlanta Journal Constitution article from 2005, Cleveland McMullen (aged 83 at the time) shared that he grew up in Flat Rock and joined the exodus of thousands of Southern blacks who fled to the North during the Great Depression to find jobs in factories and escape enforced segregation. He recalled that Flat Rock had its own \\"scout\\" team (baseball), which played rivals from nearby communities, such as Lithonia, and, toward Atlanta, Edgewood. But McMullen can't recall the team name of the home nine, just that \\"it was a big deal, people came from all over. They'd have a barbecue, make a whole day of it.\\"  The Flat Rock Historical Landscape  The Archives sit within a historical landscape and currently maintain the 20th century Georgian Cottage known as the T.A. Bryant, Sr. House built in 1917. The T.A. Bryant, Sr. house was donated to the Archives by T.A. Bryant, Sr.'s son and Co-Founder T.A. Bryant, Jr. The site also includes a barn, smokehouse, and outhouse constructed throughout the 20th century. The historical landscape also includes the Historical African American Flat Rock Cemetery. According to Dr. Jeffrey Glover of Georgia State University's 2008 cemetery mapping project there are approximately 202 graves with 107 being unidentified fieldstones.  Community outreach  The Flat Rock Archives is currently collecting and preserving a wide range of archival material, including genealogical records, newspaper articles, photographs, maps, church records, school records, rare books, and tangible artifacts that relate to African-American history in the rural South. In 2010, the Flat Rock Archives worked with Arabia Mountain High School to perform an honorary school graduation ceremony for eight African American elders of the Flat Rock community who were in their 70s, 80s and 90s. The students all attended Flat Rock School in the 1930s and 1940s, a time when there was such hostility to educating blacks. The students were given honorary high school diplomas from the DeKalb County school system because during the time they were in school the county did not give high school diplomas to blacks. The DeKalb History Center is currently housing the Flat Rock Archives exhibit \\"Deep Roots in DeKalb: The Flat Rock Story of Resilience\\". It includes objects collected from community residents that showcase more than 150 years of history. Deep Roots in DeKalb: The Flat Rock Story of Resilience is Open at the DeKalb History Center in Decatur, Georgia through 2021. An opening reception was held on the evening of Thursday, February 28th, 2019, at the DeKalb History Center. Staff of the DeKalb History Center, Flat Rock Archives, National Park Service and the Arabia Mountain Heritage Area Alliance were present, as well as members of the public and officials from DeKalb County and the cities of Decatur, Lithonia, and Stonecrest. The Archives also maintains the Historic African American Flat Rock Cemetery.

These three core demands are: # ‚ÄúThe parliament must be dissolved.\\" ‚Äî due to failed government management of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising unemployment rate, and the closing of many businesses. The government was also accused of failing to deal with \\"VIP‚Äù cases of COVID-19 that were allowed into the country without quarantine. # ‚ÄúStop threatening the citizens\\" ‚Äî since the 2019 Thai general election, many have been threatened for criticising the government. # \\"New constitution\\" ‚Äî the current constitution, which was drafted by Prayut's allies, paved the way for him or any future soldier-turned-politician to remain in power. Many who campaigned against this constitution earlier in the 2016 referendum were arrested or threatened. A Free Youth leader stated that they do not aim to overthrow the monarchy, as others have alleged.  Protests under Three Demands  Seri Thoey group flew the LGBT flag during the protest on 25 July On 18 July, Thailand saw the largest street demonstration since the 2014 Thai coup d'√©tat at the Democracy Monument in Bangkok with around 2,500 protesters. The protesters, organised under the name Free Youth (; ), announced the three aforementioned demands. The event was triggered by the failed economy of the country due to pandemic, and unjustified implementation of the Emergency Decree that was heavily criticised as being a tool against any possible protest. The gathering was planned to last overnight and disband on the next day. However, it was cancelled by midnight for security reasons. Charnvit Kasetsiri, Thai historian, warned the protestors that they should not stay overnight, so as to prevent the tragedy of Thammasat University massacre of 1976. After 18 July, the protests soon spread across the country. The first were in Chiang Mai province and Ubon Ratchathani Province on 19 July. By 23 July, demonstrations had been organised in more than 20 provinces. On 22 July, a group of activists from Srinakharinwirot University (SWU) under the name \\"SWU Generation of Change\\" (‡∏°‡∏®‡∏ß ‡∏Ñ‡∏ô‡∏£‡∏∏‡πà‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏µ‡πà‡∏¢‡∏ô) organised a protest at the Democracy Monument claiming that they were ‚Äúextolling the beauty of the newly created garden‚Äù, mocking the potted plants placed around the Democracy Monument by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration brought around 18 July to block protesters from entering. The potted plants were removed a few days later. On 25 July, a group of LGBT people, organised under the name Seri Thoey (lit. Free Thoey; parody to the Seri Thai - Free Thai Movement), demonstrated at the Democracy Monument calling for legalisation of same-sex marriage in addition to the three demands given earlier. The mob was highly praised online for using parodies of memorable kathoey gags from the famed kathoey comedy horror film Hor Taew Taek (Haunting Me). Thai youth activist Netiwit Chotiphatphaisal commented that 25 July protest was full of creativity, including colourful outfits, colourful hair, distinct personal style and marked by a few choice words. He considered it a \\"landmark moment\\" in recent Thai political protests. On 26 July, an event called ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs run, Hamtaro‚Äù was organised at the Democracy Monument. Having begun as online activism that spread on Twitter, it eventually gathered around 3,000 people. The event consisted of running around the monument whilst singing a jingle from Hamtaro, a famous Japanese cartoon, with some satirical amendments to the lyrics on political corruption. The well-known lyrics from Hamtaro; ‚Äúthe most yummy things of all are... sunflower seeds!‚Äù, was amended to ‚Äúthe most yummy things of all are.... citizens‚Äô taxes!‚Äù. The parody was used initially in a protest at Triam Udom Suksa School in Bangkok few days earlier. The video of students singing the jingle soon spread online and eventually inspired the running event. On 30 July, two vocational student groups held a demonstration: the royalist \\"Vocation [students] Help the Nation\\" group accused the protesters of attempting to \\"overthrow the monarchy\\", while the groups \\"Vocation [students] for the People\\" and \\"Cogs of Democracy\\" sided with the protesters. Sits-in at Nakhon Ratchasima Province on 24 July Each with its own satirical names, some major ones are: * 19 July, Tha Phae Gate, Chiang Mai Province ‚Äî joined by Free Youth and students from Chiang Mai University. * 19 July, City Pillar Shrine, Ubon Ratchathani Province ‚Äî peaceful demonstration organised by students and staff of Ubon Ratchathani University * 22 July, MSU, Maha Sarakham Province ‚Äî Protesters announced 4 demands to the government, namely the three demands and election under the 1997 Constitution.

Videos circulated online infuriated many. * 24 July, Thao Suranari Square, Nakhon Ratchasima Province ‚Äî sit-ins organised by a group of students and lecturers from four academies in the province. It saw one of the largest crowds amongst other protests. On 27 and 29 July, Thais in Paris, New York City and London also protested against the Prayut government.

Background  Cohen and Stephanos were avid fishermen and would go fishing at an area not far offshore. The two boys would routinely check in with their parents, every couple of hours. Stephanos's grandfather told reporters that his grandson had operated the boat about twenty times and that family members were comfortable with him operating the boat. About a week prior to the boys disappearance Stephanos had been stopped by a Marine Patrol Officer for a routine check, and all safety equipment mandated by Florida law was aboard the boat. On July 23, 2015, Cohen sent a message to another friend via Instagram that read; \\"Me and Austin are crossing to the Bahamas tomorrow. Come with us, we wouldn't check in.\\" Another friend reportedly spoke to Stephanos about traveling to the Bahamas prior to their departure with Stephanos said that the weather was too rough. Cohen reportedly asked his step-father that night if he could borrow his GPS to use on Stephanos's boat.  Disappearance  The night prior to their disappearance Cohen and Stephanos spent the night together at Stephanos's home before planning to go fishing the next morning, although Cohen had told a friend that they were planning to head to the Bahamas. On the morning of July 24, 2015, Cohen and Stephanos traveled to the Jupiter Island marina, to go fishing on an eighteen-foot, single engine 1978 SeaCraft that was registered to Stephanos's mother. They were last seen at the Jib and Yacht Club and Marina where they spent about $100 USD on gas and Stephanos texted his parents around 11:25 AM and they left the marina sometime before noon. Shortly after they left a line of thunderstorms were documented moving towards the area, and the National Weather Service issued a special marine warning that warned of heavy rains and winds potentially in excess of 40 mph. It is believed that the boys were overtaken by the storm, as Stephanos's cellphone was disconnected from the Internet around 1:15 PM. His last social media post was from his Snapchat account, with one of the posts being the boys on the boat with fishing poles and a message stating; \\"Peace Out Jup\\", which friends claim meant the boys were going to the Bahamas. A friend told reporters that another post from that day from Stephanos's account was a video of the fast moving storm headed towards the boat, with the commentary; \\"We're f-cked\\".  Search efforts  A fund was created in order to pay for private efforts of searching for the boys and thousands of dollars was raised within a few hours of the fund being created. Dozens of people, including NFL Hall-of-Famer Joe Namath, joined the search and participants followed shorelines and beaches looking for any debris washed ashore. Due to the vast sea area to be searched, multiple boats and aircraft were used to search for the missing boys. A Coast Guard C-130 airplane, a Miami helicopter crew, a HR 144 plane, two US Customers and Boarder Protection planes and two Coast Guard Cutters were used along with multiple private boaters and pilots offering their help. The search was made difficult as it was determined that the boat was not equipped with an emergency positioning beacon or any other safety equipment, such as a radio or GPS. The boat that the boys were operating was originally discovered on July 26, 2015 near Daytona Beach, Florida and the Coast Guard attached a data- marker buoy to the boat and left to continue to search for Cohen and Stephanos. It was re-discovered on March 18, 2016 about one-hundred-miles from Bermuda. An I-Phone and other personal effects were found on board the boat. The search for the boys was called off on July 31, 2015.  Investigation  Due to the storm that occurred shortly after the boys left the marina, while the boys were declared missing they were generally believed to be victims of the violent storm. However, with the rediscovering of the boat on March 18, 2016 the parents of Cohen believed that there was potentially additional information in the fate of the two boys. The boat was discovered to have the ignition and the battery switched to the Off position, which could potentially indicate foul play. However, as there is no other evidence of foul play all the items found in the boat were turned over to the boys families, without investigation into the objects. Cohen's parents filed a lawsuit against an I-phone being returned to Stephanos's parents as they felt it would break the chain of custody and any evidence would be tainted by potential bias.  Legal  In 2016, Cohen's parents filed a lawsuit against an I-Phone that was discovered in the boat being returned to Stephanos's family. Cohen's parents argued that the phone being returned to Stephanos's family would potentially taint any evidence found on the phone. Despite multiple motions for emergency injunction against the Stephanos family and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the phone was turned over to the Stephanos family. It was later sent to Apple per a Judges order to be investigated by the company for the court. In 2017, Cohen's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Stephanos's family alleging that Stephanos and other family members were negligent for allowing the boys to venture into the Atlantic Ocean with an unworthy vessel and no communication devices on board. Specific charages were filed against Stephanos's father; William \\"Blu\\" Stephanos, who the Cohen's alleged delayed rescue efforts by proper authorities by undertaking his own search instead of calling 911 when he learned of the boys' disappearance from his ex-wife. In September 2020 a Palm Beach County judge ruled that William \\"Blu\\" Stephanos was not liable in the disappearance of his son and Cohen. The judge stated that the personal search did not increase the boys' risk of harm, and that the risk the boys faced were the dangerous conditions at sea.  Vigils and memorials  Shortly after their disappearance, a makeshift memorial was created out of seashells and candles to honor the boys. Artist Shepard Fairey painted a mural of Cohen at Jupiter High School in 2017. A statue to honor the boys and others lost at sea is too be installed at the south jetty of the Jupiter Inlet memorial sight, in a combined effort by the AustinBlu Foundation and the Jupiter Inlet District. The statue is being created by West Palm Beach artist Robert St. Croix. A teak plaque topped with a clear lighthouse inscribed with; \\"Keep the Light Shinning for Austin & Perry\\" was installed at the jetty, the lighthouse has a flashing LED light. The five year anniversary of their disappearance was marked in 2020, with both families engaging in separate memorials due to the ongoing legal battle.  Legacy  Both boys families set up foundations in honor of their sons. The Perry J. Cohen Foundation has donated to local organizations and schools with the Jupiter High Schools new Wetlands Laboratory named after Cohen. The laboratory works with students in an outdoor environment to teach art, photography, environment, and agriculture students. The AustinBlu Foundation has held annual fishing tournaments and helped the \\"Beacon Bill\\" signed into state law in 2016, which helps boaters with registration fees for location beacons.

Early life and education Rampton was born on 24 October 1915 in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, England. He attended Harrow School (where it was said that he could throw a cricket ball further than any other pupil before or since) and read law at The Queen's College, Oxford. Career In 1938 he joined the Freemans catalogue and online retail company which his grandfather had founded in 1906. After service in the Royal Berkshire Regiment in World War II, notably in India, he rejoined the company and served as its Managing Director (1964‚Äì1965), Chairman (1965‚Äì1984) and President (1984‚Äì1988). Under his leadership the company computerised, expanded, and built a large warehouse facility in Peterborough. In 1965 Freemans became a public company and Rampton received an unexpectedly large sum of money, much of which he and his wife gave to found the Hilden Trust, which aims \\"to address disadvantages, notably by supporting causes which are less likely to raise funds from public subscriptions\\" both in the UK and elsewhere. He also worked in the areas of race relations and the adoption of children. He and his wife set up the Standing Conference for Societies Registered for Adoption, which eventually became the British Association for Adoption and Fostering (BAAF).

This was a politically unpopular finding, and Rampton was dismissed as chair to be replaced by Lord Swann. The committee's 1984 report \\"Education for All\\" came to the same conclusion. In 1974 he established and personally funded the Freemans Trust, now the Tony Rampton Trust, which helps present or former employees of Freemans who are in need and also supports charities for which present or former employees volunteer or fund-raise. Personal life In 1939 he married Joan Shanks; they lived in Petersham in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames and had one daughter, Elizabeth and three sons, Richard, David and Ben. Rampton was also a very accomplished and largely self-taught amateur artist. Over the course of 30 years he produced 350 paintings, including portraits, landscapes inspired by views of the Thames and of the Isle of Arran where he and his family spent the summer months, and many pictures of buildings. He never exhibited during his lifetime but a retrospective exhibition of his work, opened by Michael Young, Baron Young of Dartington, was held at Orleans House Gallery in Twickenham, London in 1997. He died in London on 30 December 1993, survived by his wife and children.

He is a Member of the Provincial Legislature in the Eastern Cape for the DA and is the current Shadow Member of Executive Council (MEC) for Finance, Rural Development and Agrarian Reform.  Early Life and Education  Retief was born in the coastal city of Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape, he attended Ho√´rskool Otto Du Plessis. He furthered his studies at Nelson Mandela University from 2001 to 2005. He obtained an LLB degree and did his articles at Delport, van Niekerk Attorneys. He is a practising attorney in Nelson Mandela Bay and a politician.  Political career  Retief Odendaal joined the DA in 2004. He is a founding member of the DA Youth in Nelson Mandela Bay which was founded in 2004. He became the Ward 6 Councillor in Nelson Mandela Bay in 2009 and served as the councillor until the 2016 South African municipal elections. Retief was also the leader of the opposition in Nelson Mandela Bay from 2014 to 2016. In 2016 when the DA became the majority party in Nelson Mandela Bay he was chosen by then-mayor Athol Trollip to serve as a Mayoral Committee Member (MMC) for Finance in Nelson Mandela Bay. He served in that position until the DA was ousted in 2018 by the ANC and their coalition partners on the 27th August 2018. Retief has been a member of the Democratic Alliance Federal Council since 2014 and was also elected as the chairperson of the Provincial Disciplinary Committee for the DA in the Eastern Cape. He also served as the deputy chairperson of the DA in the Eastern Cape from 2017 to 2019. After the 2019 South African general election he was elected as a Member of the Provincial Legislature for the DA in the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature. Shortly after the election, he was made the Shadow MEC for Finance, Rural Development and Agrarian Reform. He still serves in this capacity for the DA in Eastern Cape. Government of the Eastern Cape to light.  Uncovered under his tenure  = Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality receives R200m cash boost from National Treasury (2019) = The National Treasury (South Africa) rewarded the metro with R200 Million windfall money. The money was given to the metro for their good spending performance for 2017-2018 financial year. This was due to Retief and the DA coaltion government spending 96% of their urban settlements development grants. The additional R200 million from National Treasury is money that was taken away by other municipalities or government departments who could not spend their allocated funds within the required timeframe. = Drought Disaster in the Eastern Cape (2019) = There was a serious drought disaster in the Eastern Cape in 2019. The province was experiencing one of the most disastrous droughts on record, with more than four years of low to little rainfall. The Premier made a commitment that he would declare the area a disaster zone but this didn't materialize fast enough. Due to questions asked by Retief in his oversight roles as the MEC for Finance, Rural Development and Agrarian Reform the government decided to declare the Eastern Cape a disaster area = Mismanagement in the Eastern Cape by Provincial Government (2020) = The most shocking of information that leaked during Retief's tenure was that possible Human Right Violations were taking place in the Eastern Cape by the provincial government as municipalities fail to provide water. The South African Human Rights Commission requested a formal investigation with regards to water and sanitation services provided to three local towns in the Eastern Cape. This investigation found 'prima facie violation' of the residents human rights. This is but the latest twist in the two decades of efforts by residents to stop the collapse of service delivery in these towns. = Mismanagement of experimental farms in Eastern Cape (2020) = In early 2020 information leaked that showcased how nearly 250 animals had died at the Eastern Cape government‚Äôs six experimental farming facilities. This raised serious concerns around care and possible neglect at these facilities. Retief asked questions to the premier in this regard and lead to the expose that the media received. The deaths of these animals raised various questions as to whether the animals were vaccinated and whether the staff were compentent in dealing with animals and more specifically treating these animals.  Personal Life  Retief is a fluent speaker of Afrikaans and English. He has three children. Retief married Anne-Marie Potgieter on 24 September 2010 in Port Elizabeth.

Biography Little is known of John Westwyk's early life. The name Westwyk is almost certainly a toponym; he presumably came from the hamlet of Gorham-Westwick, two miles west of St Albans. He was a monk of St Albans Abbey by 1380, and was most likely ordained between 1368 and 1379. Like many monks, he was probably the son of a mid- ranking peasant or yeoman. Westwyk probably received a basic education in the almonry school associated with the Abbey. Like around ten per cent of the St Albans monks, he may have attended the University of Oxford. He certainly studied astronomy within St Albans Abbey, and wrote out or annotated at least two astronomy books while there.Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Laud Misc. 657, ff. 1v-52v; Oxford, Corpus Christi College, MS 144, f. 80r. Both books contained works by former abbot Richard of Wallingford (r. 1327-36), testament to Wallingford's longstanding influence on the intellectual life of the abbey. Between 1380 and 1383 Westwyk was a monk at Tynemouth Priory in Northumbria. Tynemouth was a dependent cell of St Albans Abbey, and monks were often sent there from the mother house either as punishment or to prove themselves. While at Tynemouth, Westwyk continued his studies, annotating at least two manuscripts.Cambridge, Pembroke MS 82, f. 1r; London, British Library Harley MS 4664, f. 125v. In 1383 Westwyk joined Despenser's Crusade, which captured Gravelines and unsuccessfully besieged Ypres. According to the St Albans chronicler Thomas Walsingham, Westwyk returned safely from the failed crusade. Nothing is known of Westwyk in the years 1383-93. However, in 1393 he drafted a set of tables and produced an instruction manual for a planetary equatorium, now known as the Equatorie of the Planetis.Cambridge, Peterhouse MS 75.I His tables show he was working in London, probably at the Abbot of St Albans's inn on Broad Street. His equatorium drew on earlier designs such as that by Jean de Ligni√®res, and is somewhat similar to an equatorium that survives in the library of Merton College, Oxford, but was easier to make and more user- friendly than earlier models. He evidently built it himself, albeit not at full scale. His instructions were written out in the Middle English pioneered for astronomy by Geoffrey Chaucer's Treatise on the Astrolabe, and he cites Chaucer by name. In the accompanying tables, he demonstrated painstaking copying and a flair for precise calculation. Later in life, Westwyk probably returned to St Albans Abbey. He is named as a monk of St Albans on a papal indult dated May 1397, and this may have been an end-of-life one. There is no record of him after this, and it seems likely that he died soon afterwards. Modern study Westwyk's Equatorie manuscript was in the library of Peterhouse, Cambridge by 1538, and probably by 1472.Cambridge, Peterhouse MS 75.I It was discovered there by the historian Derek de Solla Price in December 1951, making headlines worldwide. Price believed the manuscript was authored by, and written in the hand of, Geoffrey Chaucer.. This was a controversial claim, and was treated with some scepticism by Chaucer scholars, though it received influential backing from the historian of astronomy John North.. The manuscript was shown to be in the hand of John Westwyk by Kari Anne Rand in 2014.

Life  Smythies was born in Colchester in 1720. Her parents were Susan Puglet and Palmer Smythies. In 1753 Smythies published The Stage-coach ... which was an early Novel of circulation as it has as its subject not a person but an object. In this case it is the stage coach. The book contains the story of Mr. Manly and the other stage coach passengers. The book was repackaged as a two book story for its second edition and as a Three- volume novel for its third edition in 1789. One biographer sees her trying to be a female Samuel Richardson, whilst another sees the book as establishing a new approach between the first person narration of Richardson's work and the third person view of Henry Fielding. Smythies next work was The History of Lucy Wellers, Written by a Lady was published in 1754 and it concerns the story of Lucy of unknown parentage. She resists the attentions of one man and ends up happily married to a landowner. Her most well known story \\"The Brothers\\" was nearly not published as several had refused it. Smythies consulted Samuel Richardson and he advised her to ignore the publishers. He told her to gather a list of subscribers and in this she was very successful. The publication of the \\"The Brothers\\" includes the names of the subscribers over 26 pages. Richardson not only subscribed but he added the names too of his children. Notables other names on the list include William Franklin of Pennsylvania, Tobias Smollett, Garrick and Dodsley. The novel was published in 1758 and 35 of the subscribers were from Colchester. She was unusual in writing and being a woman. The lists of books published by women is quite modest and it could be that some of Smythies works have been assigned to her pen even though the evidence is not definitive. The details of her later life are not known, although The history of a pin, as related by itself \\"By the author of ‚ÄòThe Brothers‚Äô\\" was published as a children's story in 1798 and 1799. This publication could be after her death but it is not clear. One source is certain that she was alive in 1774 when her father died and dead by 1798 when her children's story was published.

History The area covered by the street lay outside the walls of Roman Eboracum, but it was occupied during the Viking Jorvik period, with various archaelogical finds dating from the era. In the Mediaeval period, the area was principally residential, the houses lying on Middle Water Lane and Friargate. From 1674, the city's Friends Meeting House was in this area. By 1881, the area was regarded as a slum, and was cleared so that a new street could be constructed. Designed to improve access to the new Skeldergate Bridge, it was named Clifford Street after nearby Clifford's Tower. The Friends Meeting House was extended, with a new main entrance on the new road. From 1882, the York Tramways Company ran horse-drawn trams along the street. In 1892, a building was opened to house the city' police headquarters and main fire station. The fire station moved to a new building on the street in 1938, which was demolished in 2018 and replaced with apartments. In 1910, the city's electricity board moved into offices on the street, also setting up a showroom. The York Dungeon visitor attraction is located on the street. Nikolaus Pevsner described the street as \\"all of a piece with a series of striking red brick buildings in a variety of styles\\". Layout and architecture Looking north from the middle of the street The street runs south from the junction of Castlegate, Coppergate, King Street and Nessgate; to its junction with Tower Street and Peckitt Lane. Cumberland Lane and Lower Friargate lead off its western side, while Friargate leads off its eastern side, as does a snickelway, the former Middle Water Lane, leading to Castlegate. Notable buildings on the west side of the street include 12 Clifford Street, the former York Institute of Science, Art and Literature, designed by W. G. Penty; the York Magistrates' Court, designed by Huon Matear; and Clifford Chambers, a block of shops and offices which now includes an entrance to the Grand Opera House theatre. On the east side are the office building at 19 Clifford Street; and 21 Clifford Street, built in 1887 for the Independent Order of Rechabites, and later used by the Christadelphians, now apartments.

He was a son of William Livingstone of Kilsyth and Christian Graham, a daughter of William Graham, 3rd Earl of Menteith and Margaret Mowbray of Barnbougle, widow of John Cornwall of Bonhard. This branch of the Livingstone family had long been landowners in Kilsyth, then also known as \\"Monyabroch\\". In 1605 the church minister John Welsh of Ayr wrote to him from his prison cell in Blackness Castle, assuring him that the wrath of God would fall on Archbishop Spottiswood and his family.Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, The Secret and True History of the Church of Scotland from the Restoration to 1678 by James Kirkton (Edinburgh, 1817), p. 25 fn. He kept in touch with the court of King James in London and was a correspondent of Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox and Margaret Hartsyde, a Scottish servant of Anne of Denmark, the chamberer who looked after the queen's jewels.HMC Laing Manuscripts at the University of Edinburgh, vol. 1 (London, 1914), pp. 105-7: Archibald Constable, Memoirs of George Heriot (Edinburgh, 1822), pp. 207-209. He was an agent for the duke's business in Scotland.Archibald Constable, Memoirs of George Heriot (Edinburgh, 1822), p. 209 fn. The Duke of Lennox was thought to be a conduit for patronage and court appointments, and those hoping to find their friends and allies positions at court would solicit his favour. However, Lennox claimed that placing more Scottish people in the king's household was increasingly difficult. He wrote to Livingstone, who had asked him to find a place for a Napier of Merchiston Castle in the king's Privy Chamber: > \\"although the King has this long time promised Merchiston ever the next > vacant place, yet many hes bein placed over him and in this hes found gret > impediments; for belive that ane stranger shall finde graet difficulty to > obteane any suche place so long as ther is any Inglishe man that does aim at > it; for it is thought by them all that ther is alreddy too many Scots heire > in such places.\\"HMC Laing Maunscripts at the University of Edinburgh, vol. 1 > (London, 1914), p. 106-7, partly modernised here. Margaret Hartsyde's letter to Livingstone describes how she was surprised by his leaving the court. Anna of Denmark had expected him to deliver a jewel to her. Hartsyde had told that queen that Livingstone had been waiting for an opportunity to give her the jewel in person. He should now send it to queen as soon as possible. Hartsyde was hoping to buy a house in Libberton in Lanarkshire with her husband John Buchanan.Archibald Constable, Memoirs of George Heriot (Edinburgh, 1822), pp. 207-209 fn & plate Margaret Fleming, Lady Torwood, aunt of his eldest son's bride, wrote to him in 1609. Other letters sent to Livingstone are primarily concerned with Lennox's interests. HMC Various Collections, 5 : Edmonstone of Duntreath (Hereford, 1909), p. 114 Hugh, Lord Campbell of Loudon, brother of Lennox's deceased second wife Jean Campbell, wrote to Livingstone in 1610 about the Lennox lands of Inchinnan, and silver that had belonged to his sister.HMC Edmonstone of Duntreath, pp. 114-7. Lennox wrote that he was glad Livingstone was coming to court in 1622.HMC Edmonstone of Duntreath, p. 121. He died in 1627. Marriages and family His first wife was Antoinette de Bord. Their children included William Livingstone of Darnchester (d. 1614), who married his cousin Anna Fleming, a daughter of John Fleming, 1st Earl of Wigtown and Lilias Graham.

Biography The little that is known of Osete's life is collected in the entry that the Encyclopaedia Espasa (vol. 40, 1919: p. 846) included in its first editions. She studied in Cartagena and Barcelona, where she wrote for illustrated fashion publications, particularly El Sal√≥n de la Moda. She translated works from French and English into Spanish, although her best-known translation, signed Flora Ossette, was Woman and Labour by the South African writer Olive Schreiner, which is thought to be the work of her husband Jos√© P√©rez Herv√°s. She married P√©rez in 1910, with whom she had a son and three daughters: Jos√©, Magdalena, √Ångela, and Florita. She collaborated with him on some works, including the Gran diccionario de la lengua castellana. The Ossete variant of her surname was used as an artistic flourish by members of the family ‚Äì the musical trio formed by their daughters presented themselves as Preziossette, a portmanteau of \\"P√©rez and Ossette\\". In the same vein, their daughter Angela, a composer and pianist, adopted the professional name of P√©rez Ossette. Translations The first translation signed by Osete, under the initials FO, was A Sportsman's Sketches by Ivan Turgenev (Editorial Ib√©rica, 1914). However, researchers Luis and Susana Silva-Villar have concluded that the work was actually translated by her husband, probably from French or English because he wanted to hide his ignorance of Russian, from which the work claimed to be directly translated. P√©rez used Osete's name again, slightly transformed into Flora Ossette, to sign the translation of Woman and Labour by Olive Schreiner. At a time when it was common for women to hide their names behind their husbands' (as in the case of Gregorio Mart√≠nez Sierra and Mar√≠a Lej√°rraga), the motivation in this case was commercial. A woman's name on the cover was used to enhance a work's appeal to feminists, a fairly common practice at the publisher Montaner y Sim√≥n. Literary critics have noted an amplification and seeming endorsement of Schreiner's feminist ideas in the translation. Gran diccionario de la lengua castellana Osete was co-author of the Gran diccionario de la lengua castellana (Great Dictionary of the Spanish Language), a work that was commissioned by , under whose authorship the first two volumes were published in 1902 and 1904. After Pag√©s' death in 1902, after having produced only a few notebooks of the work, the publishing group, under the direction of Miguel Mir, took charge of the publication of the first two volumes. Mir died in December 1912, so the work was orphaned for a second time. P√©rez took charge of the work and, together with Osete, contributed to volume III with four entries for the letter M: montar, morisqueta, mujer, and mundo. Their work continued in volumes IV and V, although only Perez's name appears as the author responsible. In all they contributed 511 entries: 267 signed by P√©rez and 244 by Osete. Hers occur more frequently toward the end of the work, and display a varied typology, with special attention given to invented, improvised, or prefabricated words. Thanks to these entries, Osete became ones of the most cited authorities of the 20th century on a lexicographical work, as she helped document newly created or recently introduced words. The Royal Spanish Academy (RAE) included this work within its lexicographical corpus.

The Georgian Revival style brick dwelling was built in 1919. History The land upon which the estate was built once formed part of General Henry Lee III's Salona Plantation in the late 18th century and was surveyed by George Washington. On the property, Noyes built Merrywood, which was said to be a copy of an 18th century mansion. The library was panelled with black walnut from trees on the estate. The gardens were landscaped by well-known landscape architect Beatrix Farrand, the niece of Edith Wharton. Newbold Noyes Sr. was the associate editor of the Washington Evening Star which his father, Frank Brett Noyes, had acquired in 1867. Frank was also the founder and president of the Associated Press. Newbold and his wife, the former Alexandra Ewing, were the parents of Newbold Noyes Jr. After Newbold's marriage to Alexandra ended, the Noyes sold Merrywood, their marital home. After the divorce, Alexandra married Thomas Stone and they built Boone Hall in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. =Auchincloss years= Sometime betweeen 1927 and 1934, Hugh D. Auchincloss acquired Merrywood from Noyes for $135,000. His maternal grandfather, Oliver Burr Jennings, had been one of the original shareholders of Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller in 1871. The following year, Auchincloss married married Nina S. Vidal, the only daughter of U.S. Senator Thomas Gore and the former wife of Eugene Luther Vidal, a Roosevelt appointee. Nina and Eugene were the parents of author Gore Vidal. After their divorce in 1941,The Kennedy White House: Family Life and Pictures, 1961‚Äì1963 By Carl Sferrazza Anthony, page 149 Auchincloss married Janet Lee Bouvier, the mother of future First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Lee Radziwill, in 1942 and the family lived together at Merrywood. Onassis later wrote of the home, stating: \\"I always love it so at Merrywood - so peaceful‚Ä¶ with the river and those great steep hills\\". The home was enlarged to 23,000 square feet and the estate featured a shooting range, tennis court, and the Olympic-sized swimming pool and a circular Arts and Crafts-style pool house. In 1959, the Auchincloss' put Merrywood on the market for $850,000, although it eventually sold for $650,000 to a syndicate led by the Magazine Brothers Construction Company that had hoped to use the property for an apartment development. After Jackie's husband John F. Kennedy was elected president, the Auchincloss family moved to Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. in 1963. A 17-story apartment building at Merrywood was proposed, but later dropped after the Government took a \\"scenic easement\\" that severely restricted development on the property. \\"The federal government paid $744,000 in early 1964 to compensate for the easement, which assures that the property will be substantially \\"frozen\\" in its current state.\\" =Later owners= On November 14, 1964, the syndicate sold the property for about $660,000 to C. Wyatt Dickerson, a successful businessman, and his wife Nancy, a reporter for CBS and NBC, and the \\"first female star of television news,\\" which by then had a swimming pool, a tennis court and a gymnasium. They Dickersons sold of the estate for development in 1965; reducing the estate to the parcel it remains today. During the Dickerson years, the home was host to Frank Sinatra, James Stewart, Jack Benny, New York Governor W. Averell Harriman, Walter Annenberg, Edward Bennett Williams, and Nancy and Ronald Reagan shortly before his inauguration. The Dickersons later separated, Wyatt moved out in 1981, and they sold the house in 1984. In 1989, Nancy married former Goldman Sachs chairman John C. Whitehead. In 1984, Alan I. Kay, a real estate investor,Bernstein, Alan, \\"Alan I. Kay, Washington area real estate magnate and philanthropist, dies at 75\\", The Washington Post, June 19, 2010 and his wife Dianne Comess bought Merrywood for $4.25 million which was considered \\"one of the largest sums ever paid in the Washington area for a single-family residence.\\" Reportedly, \\"C. Wyatt Dickerson, the Kays and a middleman sealed the deal over a bottle of 1962 Dom Perignon champagne midnight Friday at Georgetown's Pisces Club.\\" The Kays further enlarged the home from a 26-room residence to 36-rooms and built the 5,000-square foot pool house. In 1999, the Kays sold Merrywood for $15.5 million to William E. Conway Jr., who co-founded the Carlyle Group, owned Merrywood for less than a year before selling it to former CEO of AOL Steve Case and his wife, the former AOL executive Jean Villanueva, for $24.5 million, again breaking the region's property sales records. The home featured nine bedrooms, 11 full bathrooms and two partial baths, \\"formal gardens, a pavilion with full kitchen, indoor and outdoor pools, a carriage house with indoor parking for four automobiles, and a lighted tennis court, plus public rooms scaled to accommodate large gatherings, an expansive master suite with his or her dressing rooms, a private study and exercise room.\\" =Current ownership= In 2018, the Cases placed Merrywood on the market for $49.5 million, eventually selling it to the Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for $43 million, making it, again, the most expensive property ever sold in the area.

Snow's Corridors of Power in Whitehall. The Executive, clearly based on the actual MI5 or Security Service, figures in 21 novels featuring Russell and in four others in which Russell is not a character. Haggard himself, who had served at least for a while as an Intelligence Officer during the War, called it \\"not entirely imaginary\\". Superbly urbane, Russell is presented throughout the series as an \\"unapologetic\\" Establishment conservative but, perhaps because of his part-Irish heritage, is far from being a racist: in at least one of his books, he hopes that a Black \\"operator\\" of the Executive, William Wilberforce Smith, will become its head. Background and appearance We learn in Slow Burner, the first Russell book, that he is somewhere in his fifties and unmarried. By the second book, he says he is sixty and we are told he is about to retire. In the third book, however, no mention is made of retirement and he remains sixty or \\"rising sixty\\" for the next four books.

Perhaps because of his Army background, to help his thinking about a problem he may write an Appreciation of the situation in longhand, arranging everything into neat categories.

It draws on the common ground shared by contemporary research in the various areas that are collectively known as cognitive science and is designed to be applicable to all these fields of research. It was established, by Michael Sharwood Smith and John Truscott in the first decade of the 21st century with a particular focus on language cognition when it was known as the MOGUL framework (Modular Online Growth and Use of Language). The MCF is open-ended in the sense that it has a set of basic principles (see below) describing the architecture of the human mind: these amounts to setting out a skeleton model of the mind and providing a template for cognitive scientists to use. Both mind and brain are viewed as biological phenomena but at different levels of abstraction. These fundamental principles can be further interpreted in various ways by any researcher who is working with a theoretical approach that can be said to reflect, or can be aligned with the basic principles. In doing so researchers can identify their own hypotheses and research findings not only as confirming or challenging their own theory but also as a manifestation of the basic principles underlying all cognitive processing and representation. By the end of 2020 four books based specifically on the framework had been published along with over 35 articles and chapters; numerous publications and theses by researchers using the MCF for their own purposes had also appeared. This has built on the framework giving it a richer, more elaborate structure in those areas that have been investigated. Nonetheless, different version of the elaborations can still be proposed. The predominant assumption of the MCF is that the mind is composed of a collaborative network of functionally specialized systems which have evolved over time together with their physical manifestations in the brain that reflect their abstract organization albeit in very different ways. Researchers working in very different areas of cognitive science ought to be able without difficulty to see each other's research as an elaboration of the same framework. Basic Principles 1\\\\. Functional Specialisation. The mind has a modular architecture. This means it has a finite set of functionally specialised cognitive systems such as the auditory system, the motor system and the conceptual system. 2\\\\. Mind/Brain Relationship. Cognitive systems are manifested in the physical brain in various, often very different ways. This means that mind and brain, though intimately related, still require distinctly different levels of description and explanation. 3\\\\. Representational Diversity. Each system has its own unique operating principles such that its representations are formed in an identifiable manner and in ways that distinguish them from representations in any other system. The structure of any given representation is coded in such a way as to allow it to form more complex representations of the same kind, i.e. within its own system. Primitive representations in each system are the simplest and are provided in advance as part of our biological inheritance. In this way meaning (conceptual) representations can be combined with other conceptual representations to form more complex meanings. 4\\\\. Association. These cognitive systems form an interactive network allowing representations in different systems to be associated (but see below). 5\\\\. Information Encapsulation. Due to the different codes in which representations of various types are written, one cognitive system cannot share information with another cognitive system. Associated representations of different types can only be associated and coactivated during online processing. 6\\\\. Coactivation. In response to current experience, associated representations across the mind as a whole are coactivated in parallel forming temporary online representational networks or schemas. 7.Each Mind is Unique. The way in which combinations of representations of the same type are formed within a given system and the ways in which associations of representations of different types are formed over the lifetime of one individual make the mind of that individual unique. In other words, the fixed architecture of the mind still allows everyone to be different from everyone else and to respond to new experiences in different ways. 9\\\\. Acquisition by Processing. Change (development, acquisition, growth) occurs as a result of online processing. This principle is reflected in the following statement: acquisition is the lingering effect of processing (Truscott and Sharwood Smith 2004a),Truscott, J & M. Sharwood Smith. (2004a). Acquisition by processing: a modular perspective on language development. Bilingualism: Language and Cognition 7,1, 1-2. (Truscott and Sharwood Smith 2004).Truscott, J & M. Sharwood Smith. (2004). How APT is your theory: present status and future prospects. Bilingualism: Language and Cognition 7,1,43-47. 9\\\\. Variable Activation Levels. Cognitive representations are activated online to different degrees and may compete with one another for participation in the building of a more complex representations online. This is partly because they possess a resting level of activation which will rise or decline according to the frequency and regularity with which they are activated. Extremely high levels of activation are associated with phenomena described variously as attention, awareness and consciousness. 10\\\\. Language versus Linguistic'. Human language development and use comes from product of the online interaction of all cognitive systems. However, it qualifies as human language by virtue of one, or two (depending the linguistic-theoretical perspective adopted) functionally specialized systems that have evolved specifically to handle linguistic structure. Architecture Each functionally specialized system (module) has a common structure consisting of a store and a processor. This store/processor combination holds for all systems and is a simple, abstract version of what, in its neural manifestation, can involve multiple locations and pathways in the physical brain. The processor is run according to the special operating principles of the given cognitive system as determined by the theory adopted by researchers in their relevant area of specialization. It controls the creation and combination online of its representations. The store is where representations are housed at various resting levels of activation and where they are activated. The mind does not have a single memory where all representations are stored and activated: it has many, that is, one store for each system. In a given store, an activated representation, complex or otherwise, is said to be in that system's working memory(WM). In other words, WM is a state and not a system in its own right (Cowan 1999 Cowan 1999). In a more general sense, WM can be thought of as a combination of all the currently activated representations, each in their individual stores. Representations are also called (cognitive) structures and this is reflected in the abbreviations. Hence a visual representation is called a visual structure and abbreviated as VS. Cognitive systems are linked by interfaces which can be thought of as simple processors that enable the association and coactivation of representations in adjoining systems. The visual/auditory interface, for example, links these two sensory perceptual systems and allows a visual representation to be associated and coactivated with a given auditory representation. Where a visual representation of, say, a tree is associated with the abstract meaning TREE, this would be explained as an association occurring between the visual and conceptual systems, i.e. across the VS/CS interface. The set of cognitive systems can be conceptualised as consisting of two types. The first, forming an outer ring, consists of the set of perceptual systems that each receive a particular type of raw input (visual, auditory, olfactory etc) from the external environment via the senses and each produce as their output their own cognitive representations of the world outside. This means that the world that we feel we know as the external world is actually the world that is represented internally in our five perceptual systems. Representations in these systems are collectively known as perceptual output structures (POpS). They are richly connected with one another and capable of the very high activation levels necessary for survival. This makes them an essential part of how conscious experience is to be explained. The second set of systems at an inner or deeper level are not connected directly with raw input coming in from the environment. They comprise the conceptual system responsible for abstract meanings, the affective system which is responsible for positive and negative values and basic emotions, the motor system and the spatial system. The final system or set of two systems are responsible for creating linguistic structure. The MCF currently uses the two-system alternative following Jackendoff Jackendoff, 1987, Jackendoff 2002. are, respectively, the phonological system which associates specific auditory structures with phonological structures (PS) and the syntactic system which associates syntactic representations (SS) with meanings, i.e. conceptual structures (CS). Similarly, associations are also made between the two linguistic systems at the PS/SS interface. Inevitably the two linguistic systems are richly interconnected along with their direct connections with the conceptual and auditory system and also the visual system as well since it is currently assumed that sign language users make direct associations between visual representations (VS) and representations in the phonological store hence making the phonological system do double duty (Sandler 2012 Sandler 1999).

He signed tennis player Steffi Graf for public relations before her international success. He was the founder of the Halle Open, a tennis tournament on the ATP Tour.  Life and career  Weber was born in Halle, North Rhine-Westphalia, where his mother ran a shop selling stationery, wool and clothing. In his early life, he worked at his mother's shop and came into contact with the fashion industry. After school, he attended the H√∂here Handelsschule vocational school and trained to be a textile merchant. He first worked in a textile factory, post which he opened a fashion shop in Versmold in 1965. Store in Mannheim In 1973, he founded the company Hatex AG in Halle with his friend Udo Hardieck. The company specialized in trousers for women, before branching out to full-range women's fashion in the early 1980s. The company was renamed Gerry Weber International AG in 1986, and stylized as Gerry Weber. In 1986, Weber went on to sign tennis player Steffi Graf at age 17 before her international success, to be an ambassador for the Gerry Weber brand in a move considered to be a marketing coup. The company was listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 1989, with the family as the largest stockholder. Weber retired from his post as chief executive in 2014 and was succeeded by his son. He remained on the supervisory board until 2018. The company faced challenges from low-cost providers as well as declining interest from younger customers. In 2019, the family lost all influence on the company which was taken over by investors. = Sports = Weber, a golf player, organized an ATP Challenger Tour event in 1992, a clay court event at the tennis club in Halle. The following year, this event became the Halle Open and was held on grass court at the Gerry Weber Stadion (now OWL Arena) that he helped build in 1992. He was also the president of the TC Blau- Weiss club, which became one of Germany's most successful tennis clubs. The Gerry Weber Stadion has been used for cultural and community events, including concerts by Elton John, Whitney Houston and Luciano Pavarotti. He also supported the soccer club Arminia Bielefeld from 2017. = Private life = Weber was married to Charlotte Weber, and the couple had two sons.

It succeeded the summer statement held earlier in the year, and was a partial replacement to the cancelled budget scheduled for the Autumn. The purpose of the statement was to announce measures aimed at further helping to promote economic recovery following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The statement was delivered to the House of Commons. The plan aimed to further promote economic recovery while preserving jobs and businesses which were considered viable. Background Rishi Sunak delivered his first budget as Chancellor in March 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic was in its early stages in the UK. The country went into lockdown, requiring all but essential services to close. The government announced a series of measures to protect companies, and the jobs of employees whose firms were required to close as part of lockdown, including a furlough scheme that would see the government pay 80% of the wages of workers who were furloughed. The scheme was initially to run until the end of June, but later extended through October. By June, 9.3 million people were being financially supported by the scheme. There were concerns about unemployment, which, by the end of June was nearing 3 million, and threatening to exceed the previous highest unemployment figures last seen in 1986, and fears of a deep recession. In July 2020 Sunak delivered a summer statement aimed at helping to reduce the potential impact of a recession. Sunak delivered the statement to the House of Commons on 8 July. On 23 September 2020, Sunak announced he would unveil his plans for the future of the economy amidst an increase in COVID-19 restrictions and due to the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme coming to an end on 31 October. Hours later, the treasury confirmed the autumn budget had been cancelled. Key points The statement included the following provisions: *The reduction in value-added tax from 20% to 5% for the hospitality sector ‚Äì food outlets, accommodation and attractions announced in the summer statement was extended to 31 March 2021. *A new Job Support Scheme designed to replace the Job Retention Scheme whereby the government tops up wages for employees who were brought back from furlough and working a reduced number of hours. *An extension to the Self Employment Income Support Scheme on similar terms to the above scheme. *Coronavirus Business Interruption loans and Bounceback Loans extended from 6 to 10 years. Reaction The announcements were broadly welcomed by the business sector. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said the measures would \\"save hundreds of thousands of viable jobs this winter\\", while the British Chambers of Commerce said they would give the economy \\"an important shot in the arm\\". But the independent think-tank, the Resolution Foundation, suggested that though the Job Protection Scheme would slow the rate of unemployment, it would not stop what it described as \\"major\\" job losses. Rob Paterson, the CEO of Best Western GB, said the government's economic strategy had made it impossible for the hospitality sector to retain staff: \\"Restrictions that have been imposed recently have severely dampened our revenues and the support package that was announced by the Chancellor...means that we're paying a higher hourly rate for our employees in a time when our revenues are severely compounded\\".

First Chechen War  Lecha Khultygov was given the nickname \\"Mountain Falcon\\" by Dzhokhar Dudayev. Khultygov took part in 14 major combat operations and battles. Battles of \\"local significance\\" and local skirmishes with the enemy does not count. He is credited with having destroyed dozens of russian armored vehicles and having downed 2 helicopters. A common tactic of Khultygov's was exhausting the enemy's forces by hitting them in the rear and delivering sudden attacks on the gathering of military vehicles and equipment. This method of warfare caused the enemy to panic and suppressed their will to resist. He emerged victorious from any seemingly hopeless situation. There was one counted 72 holes from shrapnel and bullets on his clothes. After getting seriously wounded during a battle, he walked on foot from Novogrozny to Ilshana-Yurt bleeding, and without assistance. http://chechenews.com/%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9-%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB-%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BC%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%B8-%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%8F-%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B8-%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%87/ Interwar period On December 30, 1997, Khultygov became acting director, and from January 6, 1998, director of the National Security Service, replacing Apti Batalov in this position . During the Chechen interwar period, Khultygov repeatedly and publicly called on his colleagues to stop political intrigues and recognize Aslan Maskhadov's authority. He also positioned himself as an initiator and determined fighter against crime. He declared former armed resistance fighters involved in criminal crimes as enemies of the Chechen state and people, and was the first to admit that a number of influential field commanders and participants in the war were involved in gangs. In this struggle, Khultygov considered it possible to apply the most stringent measures. He was one of the first to put forward the idea of public shootings. The first such shooting, which took place in the center of Grozny in August 1997, caused a wide response in the Republic and abroad. The prestige of Khultygov in Ichkeria grew greatly after this event, which was primarily due to the complex criminal situation in Ichkeria at that timehttps://constitutions.ru/?p=4049. Under him, National Security Service(NSS) was purged, and he took measures to improve the professionalism of employees. In February 1998, at least two heads of departments and their deputies, four heads of departments and their deputies, and more than 20 operational employees were dismissed. In March, the resulting vacancies were filled by vertical movement of employees. Three months later, a second recertification was carried out. In early 1998, the situation in Ichkeria worsened due to the Wahhabis , who imposed their interpretation of Islam on the population. Khultygov made a public statement in which he argued that their actions directly contradicted the national traditions of the Chechens. He also argued that the situation was destabilized by agents of foreign intelligence services, including from Muslim countries, such as, for example, Turkey and Pakistan, pursuing mercenary goals. At the same time, Khultygov advocated cooperation with the Russian special services. He did not limit himself to words: in December 1997, he visited Moscow, where he established contacts with the leadership of the FSB to fight crime and terrorism. In the spring of 1998, as a result of joint actions by the NSS and the Anti-Terrorist Center, several dozen militants were detained. A number of foreign citizens who preached religious extremism and intolerance were expelled from the country. These actions provoked a sharp reaction from radical Islamists, who subjected Khultygov to harsh criticism. A group of senior religious and government officials appealed to Maskhadov with a demand to remove Khultygov from the NSS leadership. However, the President of Ichkeria supported Khultygov's actions. Death On June 21 1998, a group of militants led by Vakha Dzhafarov, who belonged to Salman Raduyev, tried to seize the building of the TV center in Grozny. During the skirmish, Lecha Khultygov, Vakha Dzhafarov, and another NSS officer were shot dead. The death of Khultygov was considered a serious loss for the leadership of Ichkeria. Lecha Khultygov headed one of the most influential and formidable Chechen special forces, and was considered a \\"strong man\\" in Aslan Maskhadov's administration. Along with Khunkar-Pasha Israpilov, Khultygov was the director of the Chechen National Security Service and initiated the fight against crime during the Chechen interwar period (1997-1999). Following Lecha's death, his brother Ibragim Khultygov replaced his position as the director of the Chechen National Security Service in 1998.https://www.1tv.ru/news/2000-08-07/298785-v_chechne_sdalsya_byvshiy_nachalnik_tak_nazyvaemoy_sluzhby_natsionalnoy_bezopasnosti_ichkerii Sources Category:1998 deaths Category:Chechen people ","title":"Lecha Khultygov"},{"id":"65409877","text":"Karin Aurivillius (1920-1982) was a Swedish chemist and crystallographer.
