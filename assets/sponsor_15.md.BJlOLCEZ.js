The Hebrew term and title is applied to exceptional Talmudic scholars among Orthodox Jews. It is used among English speaking and Yiddish speaking Orthodox Jews to identify, as a type of mark of honor, those who have been blessed with greater mental and intellectual capabilities than the average intelligent Torah scholar. Etymology Illui is a noun (meaning \\"above,\\" \\"elevation,\\" \\"going up,\\" or \\"best\\" from the root ◊¢◊ú meaning \\"on top\\" or \\"above\\" ) derived from the Hebrew and Yiddish. Recognition of genius It is considered a mark of honor and excellence for a Talmudic scholar to be recognized as an illui and to be described and called as such by his peers. It indicates that he is regarded as having extraordinary intelligence and mental capacity, necessary for the most serious, advanced and complex Talmudic learning and Torah study. Usage In common terminology, an illui would be someone who has an extraordinarily high \\"IQ\\" as recognized from early childhood as a child prodigy by rabbis and Torah scholars who have a keen eye to recognize the qualities of excellence in budding young Torah scholars. Haredi and Hasidic Jews are very familiar with this term, and if a scholar that they are familiar with has been known to have been called an illui they will regard it as a great honor for that individual as well as for his family, teachers and those with whom he associates. In Orthodox, Haredi and Hasidic circles, the term illui is applied to males only, as women are not obligated in Torah study to the same degree that men are required to devote much of their early life to serious and intense Torah studies, also referred to as Torah learning. Most rosh yeshivas (heads of yeshivas) have been called illuim as have many Hasidic Rebbes. Views of origins There are some Judaic mystical traditions that explain how and why illuim are different. One explanation attributes it to an \\"Angel's Slap\\": :An intriguing legend from the Talmud and Midrash describes how a child, while still in its mother's womb, is taught the entire Torah to the glow of a supernatural lamp that allows it to see to the ends of the earth. It is only at the moment of birth that an angel appears and imposes upon it an oath to live a righteous life, and then slaps the youngster on the mouth or the nose, causing it to forget all that it has learned. :The angel's smack in the Talmudic legend produces total amnesia for all, but in the Greek theory of \\"anamnesis\\" the souls quaff varying quantities of the oblivion-inducing potion. The clever souls drink no more than they have to, which makes for an easier job of learning and recalling during their coming lives. Only the foolish and short-sighted souls make the mistake of rashly and greedily gulping down excessive doses, dooming them to lives of ignorance and dull-wittedness. :Furthermore, the Jewish world had its share of child prodigies and geniuses who mastered the Talmud at a tender age (such a person is known in Hebrew as an \\"Illui\\"). This phenomenon could be ascribed to the soul's evading the angel's slap, whether by accident or design. The usage of the term is also used with caution in terms of its practical implications for the one who holds it. For example, Jonathan Rosenblum, a notable Haredi commentator has cautioned that: :Talmudic prodigies exist. But there is a certain type of wisdom that only comes with age and life experience, no matter how brilliant a person may be. That is why the leaders of the Torah world are inevitably drawn from the ranks of the ziknei hador (\\"elders of the generation\\"). If the first adjective still used to describe a person is ilui, he is probably not yet ready for leadership. Technical usage in the yeshiva world Rabbi Elijah Ben Solomon, the Vilna Gaon, leader of the Lithuanian Misnagdim. The Jewish Encyclopedia explains that in the history of the yeshivas (also known as Talmudical or rabbinical schools or academies), the term \\"illui\\" had a definite function: :Organization: :The students in the yeshibah were grouped according to the cities whence they came. Thus one would be known as \\"Itzel der Kovner\\" (Isaac of Kovno) and another as \\"Getzil der Warsawer.\\" Some received the title \\"'illui\\" (= \\"the excellent\\") or \\"matmid\\" (= \\"diligent student\\"), such a one being known, for example, as \\"Der Kovner 'Illui\\" or \\"Der Lomzer Matmid,\\" assuming that only one from a town was so designated. The title was given by the general consent of the students. They studied singly or in pair. Recognition in all denominations The term illui has widespread usage in all Jewish denominations. Rabbi Eric Yoffie, President of the Union for Reform Judaism in the United States states that: \\"... It was the illui ‚Äì the truly superior student ‚Äì who would devote his life to study, while others would return to full-time employment. Indeed, even when the great yeshivot of Eastern Europe were at their height, the number of students was relatively modest and smaller than the number of full-time Torah students in Israel today...\\" (writing for Union for Reform Judaism, 2008.) Rabbi Louis Jacobs (1920 - 2006), of the Conservative Judaism-Masorti Movement, has been described as being: \\"...Identified by his teachers as an ilui, a talmudic genius ‚Äî renowned even then for his prodigious memory and sharp intellect ‚Äî he went on to study at the Gateshead Kollel, which at that time was considered the Oxford of rabbinical academies...\\" Examples of illuim *Rabbi Jonathan Eybeschutz (1690 - 1764):\\"...An \\"illui,\\" a child prodigy in his youth, Rabbi Yonasan became one of the great commentators on the Talmud and on the \\"Shulchan Aruch,\\" the Codes of Jewish Law...\\" (Orthodox Union biography) *The Vilna Gaon (Rabbi Eliyahu ben Shlomo Zalman) (1720 - 1797): \\"...Recognized early in life as an illui (child prodigy), at the early age of six, he gave a complicated sermon (drasha) in the Synagogue of Vilna amazing the listeners by answering questions with great depth.

It was carried out annually from 1985 to 1993. The first event started on June 25 in Romanshorn on the Lake of Constance, and finished on June 30 in Geneva. 72 vehicles started in two classes; over 50 finished. The vehicles were powered exclusively by direct onboard solar power in addition to an initial charge of the onboard accumulators. The second class also allowed direct human power with pedals. The rally was conceived as a kind of race with the winners being those using the least time to travel the set course each day. The course was on unclosed public roads and the drivers were required to adhere all traffic rules and speed limits. The first events were very popular with thousands of spectators lining the roads and visiting the camps where the vehicles stopped each day. In later years the fastest vehicles also raced on round-circuit closed-off courses each day after arriving at the stops. From 1990 the organisers also held separate events called Tour de Sol Alpine. These included closed courses on frozen lakes and snowy roads and on unclosed mountain passes. After a few years other organisers carried out similar rallies, e.g. the American Tour de Sol. In 1988 the Tour de Sol also held the first race for solar powered boats on July 1 at Estavayer-le-Lac. The Tour de Sol initially stipulated direct solar power from onboard solar cells. After the first couple of events, a class was introduced which allowed charging accumulators from stationary solar panels and swapping accumulators. Later another class also allowed charging from the 230 VAC mains, provided that this amount of electricity was generated elsewhere by solar power and fed into the mains. This led to the development of the first domestic grid-feed systems. The legal form of the Tour de Sol was a foundation. It ceased in 2002. Solar engineer Josef Jenni is credited as the inventor of the event and Urs Muntwyler developed and led it for most of its years. Courses The course of the first Tour de Sol was relatively flat and direct, in later years the courses were circuitous and included mountain passes. *1985: Romanshorn - Geneva *1986: Freiburg (Germany) - Suhr *1987: Biel - Arosa *1988: Z√ºrich - Etoy *1989: Rheinfelden - Locarno *1990: Schaffhausen - M√ºnsingen *1990: Tour de Sol Alpine (on snow): Lenzerheide-Valbella (dito in 1991) *1991: Suhr - Beatenberg (total altitude gain 5000 m) *1991: Tour de Sol Alpine (on roads): Laax - St. Moritz *1992: Pforzheim (Germany) - Saas Fee *1993: Luzern - Adelboden Regulations The detailed regulations for the vehicles were described in a 24-page handbook. The main specifications for the vehicles were for the size of the solar cells and the accumulator battery. The racing category allowed a panel up to 6 m2 or 480 Watts peak and a battery capacity of up to 4.8 kWh. These vehicles were checked by the police and got temporary licences for the duration of the event. For vehicles with a regular road licence other specifications applied. Two-wheelers The vehicles mostly had three or four wheels but from the beginning a few bicycles with solar trailers participated. This later led to the development of Swiss production electric bicycles and motorcycles.

He was the first president of the Phytopathology Society of Japan and emeritus professor of plant pathology, College of Agriculture, The University of Tokyo. He worked closely together with the German mycologist P. Hennings in the identification of fungi. In commemoration of his contribution, two fungi genera were named after his family name, i.e. Shiraia P. Henn. and Shiraiella Hara and more than a dozen of species were named after him. He also published about 50 fungi species, either by himself or in cooperation with other mycologists. Shirai made great contributions to Japanese mycology and plant pathology at his time. He is also known for his contributions to the history of natural studies in Japan using his private collection of traditional Japanese and Chinese manuscripts and books. His Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica (Bencao Gangmu) is now part of the Omori Collection of the Kyoto Botanical Garden.  Life  Shirai was born in Edo (now Tokyo).

Career Guillaume was introduced to linguistics by the comparative grammarian Antoine Meillet, a student of Ferdinand de Saussure. He became well-versed in the historical and comparative method and adopted its mentalist tradition and systemic view of language. In his first major publication, Le probl√®me de l‚Äôarticle et sa solution dans la langue fran√ßaise (The problem of the article and its solution in the French Language) (1919), Guillaume set out to apply the comparative method to the uses of the articles in Modern French, in order to describe their mental system located in the preconscious mind of the speaker rather than in pre-historical time. He was to pursue his research into the system of articles for the next 20 years. In 1929, with Temps et Verbe, he described how the systems of aspect, mood and tense operate to produce an image of time proper to the event that is expressed by a verb in a sentence. This breakthrough gave him a first view of the mental system ‚Äì the \\"psychosystem\\", as he later called it ‚Äì of the verb and led him to realize that, as a part of speech, the verb is a system of systems that the speaker can use to construct a verb each time it is needed during the give-and-take of ordinary speech. From that point on in his career, he tried to analyze how words of different types are constructed ‚Äì attempting to identify the grammatical systems involved in configuring a word's lexical importance, giving rise to the parts of speech observed in French and other Indo-European languages. This led Guillaume to the conclusion that linguistics involves far more than analyzing how we understand what we hear and read. He decided that it was essential to adopt the point of view of the speaker, which would involve far more than pronouncing words and linking them together to form a sentence: \\"To study a language in circumstances as close as possible to the real circumstances of usage, one should, like a speaker, start with the language in a virtual state and trace how the speaker actualizes that virtuality.\\"Temps et Verbe (1929), p. 121 In other words, before we speak a word to express the specific experience we have in mind, we must call on the mental potentialities acquired with our mother tongue to represent this experience by forming the word's meaning, both lexical and grammatical, and to actualize its physical sign. This realization confirmed his initial postulate that language consists of langue and discours, \\"language\\"and \\"speech\\", understood as an operative, potential-to-actual binary, and not as a static dichotomy like Saussure's langue and parole. Guillaume's ongoing analysis of words led him to view each word type or part of speech as the means of incorporating certain syntactic possibilities into words themselves, to be deployed in the sentence. The challenge this poses for a linguist is to find the means of analyzing the preconscious mental operations, the \\"psychomechanisms\\" as he called them, giving rise to each part of speech. This in turn led him to examine languages where words are not formed in this way and in his last years to suggest the bases for a general theory of the word, or as he used to say, the vocable, to avoid the danger of foisting the Indo- European type of word onto languages of a very different type. Writings Throughout his teaching career, from 1938 to 1960 at the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes, Guillaume wrote out his lectures, usually given twice a week. These, along with various research notes and essays, make up some 60,000 manuscript pages kept in the Fonds Gustave Guillaume at Laval University in Quebec City. To date, 20 volumes of these documents have been published (Presses de l'Universit√© Laval). The only volume of Guillaume's writings translated into English is Foundations for a Science of Language, a series of excerpts from various lectures and essays, the first of which, from his inaugural lecture of 1952‚Äì1953, begins as follows: > \\"Science is founded on the insight that the world of appearances tells of > hidden things, things which appearances reflect but do not resemble. One > such insight is that what seems to be disorder in language hides an > underlying order ‚Äì a wonderful order. This observation is not mine ‚Äì it > comes from the great Meillet, who wrote that 'a language involves a system > where everything fits together and has a wonderfully rigorous design.' This > insight has been the guide and continues to be the guide of the studies > pursued here.\\" Awards and recognition Guillaume received the Prix Volney (Volney Prize) from for work in comparative philology in 1917. The Association international de Psychom√©canique du language (AIPL) organizes an international conference every three years for scholars influenced by Guillaume's approach to language.

Plot James 'Jimmy' Hands (James Nesbitt) and Rudy 'Rud' Guscott (Lennie James) are two friends who used to play \\"Cops & Robbers\\" when they were young. Now adults, they plan to actually rob a Bank, but the robbery goes wrong and Hands flees the Bank leaving Guscott trapped behind the security shutters. Hands is caught and arrested not long later. After being sentenced to do time in prison, Hands and Guscott make a daring escape plan as the prison is scheduled to put on a theatrical show of Nelson: The Musical. Hands and Guscott plan to use the show as cover their daring break-out attempt. During rehearsals, the inmates are unable to find a pianist for the show, until one inmate, Cliff Gumbell (Timothy Spall) volunteers and impresses them with his amazing piano skills. Hands is cast as Nelson (against his will) and Guscott is cast as Hardy, much to Guscott's dismay as his character kisses Nelson as he dies. The escape plan proves difficult to proceed with, as one of the guards becomes very suspicious of Hands. Further complications arise when one of the more dangerous inmates threatens Hands to help him escape, as well as Hands warming to a prison employee named Annabel (Olivia Williams). During a prison visiting day, Gumbell is devastated to learn that his son is spending more time with his uncle, and that his wife is very disappointed being married to a criminal. Unable to live with the shame, Gumbell commits suicide in his cell. The night of the show arrives and the escape plan is put into action. However, the dangerous inmate is tricked into going over the 30-foot prison wall and falls down the other side, where he is captured. Hands and Guscott are about to escape when Hands reveals his intentions to stay because of his feelings for Annabel. Guscott reluctantly lets Hands go and escapes with two other inmates, one of whom has a friend who arrives in a plane to help them escape. Back in the prison, one of the guards resigns from his job over frustration of the inmates escaping and becomes a car park warden. Hands is later released from prison and starts a new life with Annabel.

The Voltec architecture is primarily a plug-in capable, battery-dominant electric vehicle with additional fossil fuel powered series and parallel hybrid capabilities. Voltec vehicles like the Chevrolet Volt are all electrically driven, feature common drivetrain components, and will be able to create electricity on board using either a fuel cell or a gasoline motor to generate electricity. Regenerative braking contributes to the on- board electricity generation. Voltec is a portmanteau word from Volt, Vortec and technology. Drivetrain The Voltec drivetrain was initially demonstrated as E-Flex in the 2007 Chevrolet Volt concept vehicle that appeared in the North American International Auto Show which introduced the E-Flex drive system as an attempt to standardize many components of possible future electrically propelled vehicles, and to allow multiple interchangeable electricity-generating systems. The initial design as envisioned in the Volt combines an electric motor and lithium-ion battery plug-in system with a small engine (1.4 liter) powered by gasoline linked to a generator. The initial production Volt was propelled by an electric motor with a peak output of . Ordinarily, the Volt charged while at home overnight (plug-in hybrid-mode) through a charging port. A full charge reportedly takes 10-12 hours from a standard North American 120 V, 15 A household outlet, or 4 hours from a 240 V 15 A SAE J1772 electrical vehicle supply. The Refreshed 2016 Volt featured a 1.5L I4 engine generator that runs on regular, rather than premium gasoline, and an upgraded battery pack giving about 52 miles per charge vs. the 1st generation's 41 . Since the electrical drivetrain is not affected by the method used to charge the batteries, several options could be available for acting as an electrical power source. The primary configuration originally specified in the Volt promotional literature used a turbocharged 1.0-liter engine with three cylinders, a flex-fuel engine capable of running gasoline or E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline), although this engine never made it to production vehicles. Other engine-driven power options mentioned were a pure ethanol (E100) engine, a diesel engine capable of running biodiesel fuel, or even a hydrogen fuel cell, once that technology becomes practical. (The Ford Airstream concept, which debuted at the same show, uses a fuel cell plug-in hybrid design.) Another power-source option, one that does not rely on an internal-combustion engine at all, was demonstrated in the Volt fuel cell concept vehicle, which appeared at the 2007 Shanghai Auto Show. Due to the high cost of fuel cells compared to newer lower cost lithium batteries, General Motors has publicly suggested that the Volt will not be using fuel cells in any near term production vehicles. The general layout of the initial production platform is considered by some to be a plug-in series hybrid design (since mechanical power initially drives the generator, which in turn charges the battery pack), despite its transmission design that makes it, by definition, a parallel hybrid. Power is drained from the batteries to run the electrical motors which move the vehicle. The internal combustion engine can run at a constant speed for both optimal efficiency and mechanical simplicity (i.e., there is no need for variable cam phasing). The Voltec, like the Prius, uses a planetary gearset to couple power from two sources to the wheels. Unlike the Prius, the Voltec only rarely drives the wheels with mechanical assist from the engine, and only when battery charge is depleted. The Voltec could therefore be considered a power-split hybrid. The lithium-ion battery in the initial Voltec production vehicle is kept in a state-of-charge (SOC) range of between 30% and 80%, with the on-board generator that works to maintain the battery at the 30% charge level. GM has decided on a new descriptive terminology distinct from calling it a hybrid. They are calling the Volt an E-REV, for \\"extended-range electric vehicle\\". At high demand in charge sustaining mode, the motor output stays high to build up a charge. In this mode, the internal combustion engine is not connected to the planetary transmission through the motor generator.

It is a semiregular variable star with a maximum brightness of magnitude 14.4 and a minimum of magnitude 15.5. MY Cephei has an unusual spectral type of M7.5, one of the latest spectral types of any supergiant, and is one of the most luminous and coolest red supergiants, as well as one of the largest known stars. If placed at the center of the Solar System, the star's surface would engulf the orbit of Jupiter and possibly even the orbit of Saturn. Observations and variability Observations of the open cluster NGC 7419 in 1954 showed that four of its members were luminous red stars, most likely red supergiants. In addition, an unusually red star was found to be variable and probably an even more luminous supergiant. This star was given the variable star designation MY Cephei in 1973 in the 59th name- list of variable stars. MY Cephei is classified as semiregular variable star of sub-type SRc, indicating it is a cool supergiant, although its pulsational period is not known. It has been observed as bright as magnitude 14.4 and as faint as magnitude 15.5. The star, along with another late red supergiant star, S Persei, are sometimes considered prototypes for the class of M6‚Äì7 supergiants. Distance The distance of MY Cephei is assumed to be around or based on it being a member of the NGC 7419 open cluster. Gaia Data Release 2 gives a parallax of for MY Cep, implying a much closer distance of and a luminosity of with a corresponding radius of based on a temperature of for the spectral type M7.5 respectively, but that value is considered unreliable due to a very high level of astrometric noise. Stellar properties The spectral type of MY Cephei is given in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars as M6‚Äì7 Iab, indicating the star is an intermediate-size luminous supergiant star, although most authors gives M7‚ÄìM7.5 I. Classification is difficult because of the lack of comparable standard stars, but its spectrum appears to be later than M5, earlier than VX Sagittarii when at M9, and more luminous than M7 giant stars. MY Cephei is a very luminous, cool and large extreme supergiant star, with a luminosity more than 100,000 times that of the Sun () and a radius in excess of a thousand times the Sun's radius (). It is likely the most luminous, coolest, and the largest supergiant star in its open cluster, and occupies the upper-right hand corner of the Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram. A 2018 paper gives the star a temperature of , corresponding a radius of based on a luminosity of . The mass of MY Cephei is uncertain, but expected to be around 14.5 times the Sun's mass (). Mass is being lost at per year, one of highest mass loss rates known for a supergiant star. A newer calculation, based on SED integration, gives an unexpectedly higher bolometric luminosity of , close to the empirical upper luminosity limit of red supergiants (i.e. Humphreys‚ÄìDavidson limit). This implies a higher radius of based on an effective temperature of derived using the DUSTY model. Older studies frequently calculated even more lower temperatures and an estimated radius of .

Dynamic discounting methods are used for business-to-business transactions when contractual or pre-established early payment terms may not exist or the payment date does not conform to agreed upon discount terms. Dynamic discounting includes the ability to agree upon terms that vary the discount according to the date of early payment. The earlier the payment, the greater the discount. In addition, it includes an ability for either buyer or supplier to propose an early payment date and discount for a one-time payment using electronic mail or specialized software. Through the use of dynamic discounting methods, buying organizations can increase the number and size of early payment discounts they receive and suppliers can get paid sooner at a lower cost of capital than alternative options. A range of concepts is available to implement dynamic discounting into supply chain finance (SCF): dynamic discounting can be seen as a comparatively simple form, whereby the supplier grants a cash discount for early payment of its invoices ‚Äì the amount of the reduction and the time of payment are quickly and freely negotiable.  History  The opportunity to earn discounts in exchange for early payment in business-to-business commerce has been limited historically by the length of time necessary for accounts payable's to receive and approve paper invoices. An invoice that takes 20 days to be approved, for example, cannot be paid in time to qualify for a discount available from a supplier for payment on day 10. With the advent of electronic invoicing and Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) automation enabled by the Internet, buying organizations are increasingly able to approve invoices faster and take advantage of available discounts. Dynamic discounting methods were invented and later patented by Xign Corporation Method and system for discount management - US Patent number 8,554,673; System and method for varying electronic settlements between buyers and suppliers with dynamic discount terms - US patent number 8,484,129; System and method for varying electronic settlements between buyers and suppliers with dynamic discount terms - US patent number 8,224,625. in the early 2000s to help businesses take advantage of these trends and establish early payment terms with suppliers. Since then software enabling dynamic discounts has become a common feature of procure-to-pay automation products. More recently, dynamic discount methods are being implemented via auction sites that enable buyers and suppliers to negotiate payment terms and discounts across large amounts of their spend.  How does it work?  The buying organization offers to pay their suppliers early in exchange for a discount. The earlier the payment, the greater the discount. Historically, it's not always been easy to achieve arrangements that work for both supplier and buyer and because of practical problems, it hasn't always been easy for buyers to actually pay early. But with the increased use of Purchase to Pay (P2P) technologies and methods there is now no reason why a buyer cannot pay promptly depending on how the collaborative arrangements with the supplier have been agreed. An example of why dynamic discounting is beneficial to buyers is as follows. If a buyer receives a 2 per cent discount for early payment of an invoice‚Äîfor example paying a 30-day-net invoice after 10 days. Therefore, instead of earning interest on the cash held in an account, it is ‚Äúinvested‚Äù for 20 days to get a 2 per cent return, This represents the equivalent of an over 36 per cent annual return on capital. While the early payment of the invoice would lead to a reduction in interest on the cash, the return for early payment far outweighs the loss of interest. That early payment may also be very valuable to the supplier who values cash flow more than high margins. For many suppliers credit is difficult and / or expensive to secure. By working closely with customers and leveraging the power and flexibility of a P2P system, they can create a genuine synergy that reduces prices, reduces the cost of borrowing and ultimately‚Äîreduces the cost of doing business. Features *Discount amount is calculated dynamically based on the number of days remaining until the due date *Discounts do not need to be negotiated in advance, rather the buyer can set a liquidity limit and interest rates and allow the supplier to dynamically take discounts as working capital needs dictate *Trading parties can tap into a risk-free, alternative source of working capital with the use of third party creditors whom pay early on behalf of the buyer Benefits Dynamic discounting offers suppliers the flexibility of discounting some or all of their receivables, eliminating the need to use high-cost financing options like factoring or asset-based lending to obtain cash liquidity and stronger balance sheet positions. It also mitigates the uncertainty surrounding the timing and amount of payments, allowing for superior cash flow forecasting capabilities. On the other hand, supplier financing can enable buyers to extend their payment terms with the injection of third party capital. These benefits accrue without adversely affecting trading partner relations. Dynamic discounting is based on a buyer's credit rating instead of being pegged to the supplier's risk, further strengthening buyer-supplier relationships. *Allows buyers to pay their suppliers early in exchange for a discount *Allows buyers to benefit from double-digit, risk-free returns *Reduces large organizations annual spend by earning significantly more early payment discounts through additional discounts on non-discount invoices and maximum capture of traditional discounts *Strengthens the financial supply chain and supplier relationships by providing suppliers with quick, easy access to cash. *Fully integrated in / between two ERP-Systems the supplier can benefit from the transparency of received invoices on the buyer- side and possibly even use an integrated advice of settlement as value ad in his payment cockpit *(e.g. SAP).

Reproduced as an etching and engraving, it was published in 1741 from a third state plate produced in 1740.Dobbs p.78Paulson (Vol. 2) p.165 The scene was probably inspired by Alexander Pope's satirical poem The Dunciad. It depicts a scene in a small, dingy attic room where a poet sits at his desk in the dormer and, scratching his head, stares at the papers on the desk before him, evidently looking for inspiration to complete the poem he is writing. Near him sits his wife darning clothes, surprised by the entrance of a milkmaid, who impatiently demands payment of debts.  Background  The Enraged Musician. The engraving of The Distrest Poet in its third state was issued on 15 December 1741 as a companion piece to The Enraged Musician, a comic scene of a violinist driven to distraction by the noise from the street outside his practice room. The initial plate for The Distrest Poet was produced soon after Hogarth had completed the oil painting, but the third state plate was not completed until late in 1740 at which time Hogarth advertised his intention to issue a three-image set: The Provok'd Musician, The Distrest Poet, and a third image on the subject of \\"Painting\\". The Provok'd Musician (renamed The Enraged Musician) was produced in 1741 but the third image was never completed.Barlow p.199  Picture  The third state print, completed in 1740 and issued in 1741, featured a different bill above the poet's head. The scene is set in a small and messy garret, sparsely furnished by a few pieces of crude furniture. The room is poorly kept, with cracking plaster, a broken window and uneven floor, and a bare cupboard. In this way, Hogarth underlines the desperate circumstances of the occupants and the poverty of the family. Starved of inspiration and suffering writer's block, the poet sits on the end of his bed in his night gown, quill in hand, scratching his head. A copy of Edward Bysshe's The Art of English Poetry, a guide to composition published in 1702, lies open on the table. A copy of Pope's satirical Grub Street Journal lies on the floor near his feet. A few feet to his right sits his wife, darning the clothes on her lap and those sprawled on the floor, where a cat sits, while a crying infant, who is upset and hungry, goes unattended in the only bed. Next to the poet's wife, by the open door, an angry milkmaid presents her substantial bill, demanding payment for milk, underlining the poet's refusal to provide for his family by getting himself a proper job. The cupboard stands open and empty, save for a mouse; near the door, a dog steals the last of the family's food from a plate. Other, less obvious, elements of the painting reveal more about the poet's personality and ideas. The poem he is attempting to write is entitled \\"Upon Riches\\", which suggests that the poet lives in a fantasy world, while his wife and child go hungry.Postmus p.256 Ned Ward's first published poem in 1691 was The Poet's Ramble After Riches, which satirised his own struggles as an impoverished aspiring poet, and Hogarth may have had this in mind when he produced the picture. Earlier impressions showed the poem as \\"Poverty, A Poem\\", which hinted at a connection to Theobald who had written \\"The Cave of Poverty, A Poem, Written in Imitation of Shakespeare\\" in 1714. The poet's dreams of riches are further suggested by the map that hangs over his head, entitled \\"A View of the Gold Mines of Peru\\", replacing the image of Pope that appears in the earlier states of the print. The poet's self-interest is hinted by the presence of his pipe and tobacco on the window sill, the mug of beer sitting on the chair in the back of the room, the lace cuffs drying by the fire, his ill-fitting wig, and gentleman's sword lying at his feet; it may be that despite his family's circumstances, he refuses to forgo his own personal pleasures and effects. Alternatively, his fantasy of earning a fortune from his art may require that he keeps his gentlemanly accoutrements around him, as they will be required when his fantasies are realized. = Alexander Pope = Hogarth reproduced this image of \\"Pope Alexander\\" in the painting, but whether his intention was to mock Pope or Pope's opponents is unclear. By the time the print was issued, the image of Pope had been removed. The scene shown in The Distrest Poet was probably inspired by Alexander Pope's satirical poem The Dunciad, most likely by the prefatory matter of the second version, the Dunciad Variorum, which had been published in 1735 and in which Pope confirmed his authorship of the original. The painting and early states of the print included a quotation from Pope's work: The bill stuck to the wall above the poet's head originally featured a reference to Pope in which he was punningly mocked as \\"His Holiness Pope Alexander\\", depicted as an ape wearing a papal tiara with an ass as his Prime Minister. The initial states of the print kept the quotation but replaced the genuine bill with a representation (which appears to have been entirely invented by Hogarth rather than copied from a real bill) of Pope clashing with Edmund Curll over the unauthorised publication of the poet's correspondence. Although Hogarth and Pope had never met, this literary inspiration led to speculation as to the identity of Hogarth's poet as one of the targets of Pope's satire. Ned Ward, the author of The London Spy was a strong contender,Hallett p.137 as was Lewis Theobald, to whom the lines quoted from Pope in Hogarth's original print referred.Paulson (Vol. 2) pp.119‚Äì20 How far Hogarth sympathised with Pope is questionable. The original bill mocked him, but it featured in an image that, at the least, poked fun at the poor poet who was the subject. Hogarth may have been suggesting either that poet was showing contempt for Pope or that he placed Pope's image above his head as a model to which to aspire. In the second image, which shows Pope and Curll locked in battle, it is not clear who has the upper hand, and by the time the print was issued the direct reference to Pope had been removed completely. Ronald Paulson, the preeminent modern authority on Hogarth, suggests that Hogarth would have viewed Pope, through his Roman Catholicism, as having been implicitly tied to the continental influences that Hogarth despised, and would have seen Pope's refusal to accept the patronage of the great men of the time, while still cultivating them as friends and still reaping the rewards they had to offer, as hypocritical. Pope was part of the circle that included William Kent and Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington who had displaced Hogarth's father-in-law James Thornhill from commissions, and Hogarth also had ties to Lewis Theobald, a possible target of the satire, through illustrations he had produced for Theobald's Perseus and Andromeda, and through his subscription to Theobald's edition of the works of Shakespeare. Paulson suggests that the real \\"villain\\" of The Distrest Poet may be Pope, unseen but representing the successful \\"Great Poet\\" whom the deluded aspiring artist hopes to emulate, rather than the distressed poet himself.Paulson (Vol. 2) pp.120‚Äì22 Hogarth had featured Pope picking John Gay's pocket in the foreground of Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme, an early print he had produced on the theme of the South Sea Bubble (both Pope and Gay had invested money in the scheme).Wharton p.191 At the same time, within the satire of the painting, the poet who is distressed is going to be one of Pope's dunces. The lines by Pope, though referring to Theobald, the hero of The Dunciad, are a characterisation of a Grub Street hack, a stereotype popular in the 1730s denoting a man of limited writing ability who lived in poverty but nevertheless determinedly pursued a career in literature; therefore, the particular scribbler depicted in the painting would be one of this fraternity of \\"witlings\\" who banded together to protest Pope's poem. In this context it would make sense, therefore, for the poet to have the scabrous anti-Pope print, or an emblem of Pope's fight with the hack writers' patron, above him. Just as Moll Hackabout has a picture of Macheath on her wall in A Harlot's Progress, this aspiring and witless poet would have a picture of his hero, Edmund Curll, and an anti-Pope print. The emblem, in other words, identifies the poet's \\"side\\" in the battle between dunces and men of wit. Hogarth was well acquainted with the struggles of the Grub Street hack though, through the travails of his own father, Richard, who had been unable to make a living as writer and had eventually ended up at the Fleet Prison as a bankrupt.Paulson (Vol. 1) p.23 Hogarth may have been more than sympathetic to the dunce struggling with his rhymes. Jenny Uglow in her biography of Hogarth, posits that the gradual alteration of the prints above the poet's head could suggest a slow softening of attitudes towards Pope and his attack on the class of writer to which Hogarth's father had belonged, and perhaps evidence of Hogarth making his own compromises in his endeavours to become successful.Uglow pp.29‚Äì30  Notes  References     Category:Prints by William Hogarth Category:1736 paintings Category:1740 works Category:Collections of Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery Category:Cats in art Category:Dogs in art Category:Books in art Category:Paintings by William Hogarth ","title":"The Distrest Poet"},{"id":"15113070","text":"Gmina Kiwity is a rural gmina (administrative district) in Lidzbark County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, in northern Poland.

Padang food or Minang food is the cuisine of the Minangkabau people of West Sumatra, Indonesia. It is among the most popular food in Maritime Southeast Asia. It is known across Indonesia as Masakan Padang (Padang cuisine, in English usually the simpler Padang food) after the city of Padang the capital city of West Sumatra province. It is served in restaurants mostly owned by perantauan (migrating) Minangkabau people in Indonesian cities. Padang food is ubiquitous in Indonesian cities and is popular in neighboring Malaysia and Singapore. Padang food is famous for its use of coconut milk and spicy chili. Minang cuisine consists of three main elements: gulai (curry), lado (chili pepper) and bareh (rice). Among the cooking traditions in Indonesian cuisine, Minangkabau cuisine and most of Sumatran cuisine demonstrate Indian and Middle Eastern influences, with dishes cooked in curry sauce with coconut milk and the heavy use of spice mixtures. Padang restaurant waiters are known for their exceptional skill of carying multiple plates in their hands when serving the hidang style. Because most Minangkabau people are Muslims, Minangkabau cuisine follows halal dietary law rigorously. Most of its protein is taken from beef, water buffalo, goat, lamb, mutton, and poultry and fish. Minangkabau people are known for their fondness of cattle meat products including offal. Almost all the parts of a cattle are used in Minangkabau dishes. Seafood is popular in coastal West Sumatran cities, and most are grilled or fried with spicy chili sauce or in curry gravy. Fish, shrimp, and cuttlefish are cooked in similar fashion. Most of Minangkabau food is eaten with hot steamed rice or compressed rice such as katupek (ketupat). Vegetables are mostly boiled such as boiled cassava leaf, or simmered in thin curry as side dishes, such as gulai of young jackfruit or cabbages. Etymology In popular usage prevalent in Indonesia and neighboring countries, the term \\"Padang food\\" is often used generally to refer to the culinary traditions of the Minangkabau people of West Sumatra. However, this term is seldom used in Minangkabau inland cities itself, such as Bukittinggi, a culinary hotspot in West Sumatra, where they refer to it as Masakan Minang or \\"Minang food\\" instead. This is partly because many Minangkabau nagari (counties) take pride in their culinary legacies, and because there are differences between Nasi Padang of Padang and Nasi kapau of Bukittinggi. Padang restaurants In Padang food establishments, it is common to eat with one's hands. They usually provide kobokan, a bowl of tap water with a slice of lime in it to give a fresh scent. This water is used to wash one's hands before and after eating. If a customer does not wish to eat with bare hands, it is acceptable to ask for a spoon and fork. The food is usually cooked once per day. When eating Nasi Padang in restaurants, customers choose from various dishes which are left on display in high-stacked plates in the windows. In a dine-in hidang style Padang restaurant, after the customers are seated, they do not have to order. Rather, the waiter sets the table with dozens of small dishes filled with various dishes. Customers take only what they want from this array, and they pay only for what they take. The best known Padang dish is rendang, a spicy meat stew. Soto Padang (crispy beef in spicy soup) is commonly eaten for breakfast, while sate (beef satay in curry sauce served with ketupat) is served in the evening. The serving style is different in Nasi kapau food stalls, a Minangkabau Bukittinggi style. After the customer is seated, he or she orders specific dishes, which will be put directly upon the steamed rice or in separate small plates. There are many Padang food establishments throughout Indonesia and surrounding countries, according to Ikatan Warung Padang Indonesia (Iwapin) or Warung Padang Bonds. In greater Jakarta alone there are at least 20,000 Padang restaurant establishments.Harian Kompas, 25 May 2003 Several notable Minangkabau restaurant chains are Sederhana, Garuda, Pagi Sore, Simpang Raya, Sari Ratu, Sari Minang, Salero Bagindo and Natrabu.

The company, founded in 1920 in the north of England, moved its headquarters to Kansas City, Missouri in 2011. In 2015, Smith idled its manufacturing and it paused all operations in 2017. Smith is a manufacturer of the world's largest range of zero-emission commercial electric vehicles, with gross vehicle weights (GVWs) from . From 2010 to 2015, the company produced over 800 commercial electric fleet vehicles. Formerly based in Washington, Tyne and Wear, it manufactured vehicles for the European, Canadian, Southeast Asian and US markets. Smith was formerly part of the Tanfield Group, which trades on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market. Tanfield established a Delaware corporation, Smith Electric Vehicles US Corp (SEV US Corp), in 2009 to penetrate the North American market. The company headquarters is in Kansas City, Missouri. In March 2010, the US company indicated that it wanted to buy out its UK counterpart. After a poor multi- year trading history, Smith's UK branches were shut down. This included Smith Electric Vehicles (Europe), which was put into administration, and Smith Technologies (which entered liquidation). History=Early years= A Smith milk float, the company's most popular type of vehicle from the 1950s to the 1980s The company was founded in 1920 as Northern Coachbuilders (NCB) in Newcastle upon Tyne. After making a name as a producer of electric trams and trolleybuses, it moved into electric delivery vehicles. The company's electric vehicle and bus production were separated in 1949, with buses continuing to carry the Northern Coachbuilders brand. All NCB electric vehicles were manufactured by Smith Electric Vehicles, which was based in Gateshead. Overall ownership of the company remained unchanged; the electric-vehicle directors were Douglas Smith, Sr., Douglas Smith, Jr., and H. W. Heyman. The Smith family founded the business, and ran it until 2004. In North East England, the family owns Ringtons Tea. Smith Electric Vehicles' business in the 1950s and 60s focused on the milk float, a vehicle designed for the doorstep delivery of milk and other dairy products. As dairies phased out horse-and-cart delivery, they opted for near-silent electric vehicles for early-morning deliveries instead of noisier internal-combustion vans and trucks. Smith launched the Smith Cabac, the first delivery float with a rear-entry cab (so the milkman could exit the vehicle on either side), during the mid-1960s. The company produced four Cabac series: the 65, 75, Jubilee 77 and 85. Smith acquired competitor Wales & Edwards, which manufactured three-wheeled milk floats, in 1989. =North America= A Battronic electric minivan in 1977 The company took its first steps into North America in 1962. Smith Delivery Vehicles, based in Gateshead, signed a partnership with coachbuilder Boyertown and the Exide Division of the Electric Storage Battery of Philadelphia to produce an electric-powered delivery truck. The Boyertown-Smith connection was forged in the late 1950s, when Smith's managing director was in the United States to explore a partnership with William and James Conway (owners of Mister Softee, whose mobile ice-cream trucks were built by Boyertown). Smith obtained the United Kingdom rights to the Mister Softee brand from the Conways, and began producing Mister Softee electric ice-cream floats in 1959 in partnership with J. Lyons & Co. subsidiary Glacier Foods. The Smith family approached the firm with the Battronic proposal in 1962. At that time, there were more than 14,000 Smith Electrics in service across the United Kingdom and western Europe. The new company was organised as the Battronic Truck Corporation. Exide's parent company was a producer of electric-vehicle batteries, and Smith was a producer of electric delivery vehicles. Boyertown's contribution was its high-strength, lightweight alloy body. Early Battronics had a top speed of , and could carry a load up to on a single charge. The Potomac Edison Company of Hagerstown, Maryland, took delivery of the first production Battronic in March 1964. Smith withdrew from the partnership in 1966, and Battronic produced and sold fewer than 200 vehicles over its 20-year corporate lifespan (1963‚Äì1983). =Diversification= SEV hospital utility vehicle in Bristol In the UK, Smith had a downturn in orders for its Cabac and diversified into niche vehicles. The Smith ST range of 7.5-ton low-speed electric trucks were marketed for municipal operations and interior applications requiring heavy-duty, emissionless vehicles. Smith ST vehicles are used in nuclear power plants, large factories, and salt mines which have been converted into records-storage facilities. The company re-branded itself as SEV Group and diversified into fleet management, mobile vehicle repair and the sale, hire and maintenance of forklifts and other material-handling equipment. The Tanfield Group, an engineering company based in North East England, acquired the SEV Group in October 2004 for ¬£2.2 million and one million new ordinary shares. Tanfield restored the Smith Electric Vehicles brand name and began research and development of new electric delivery vehicles. =Development= The Faraday, a proof of concept vehicle, with a top speed of , a range of up to in urban operations and a capacity of up to , was introduced in October 2005. Built on a Smith steel chassis, the Faraday had a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of over . Early adopters, such as TNT N.V. and Sainsbury's, wanted an electric vehicle which better matched UK driving-licence restrictions. In the UK, a person with a valid license can drive a light commercial vehicle with a GVW of up to ; a vehicle between 3,500 and requires a C1 commercial-vehicle license. Smith introduced the Newton 7.5-ton truck, which housed electric drivetrain technology in a chassis by Avia in the Czech Republic, in 2006. Express and mail operator TNT N.V. took the first Newton for assessment in its London fleet.Motor Transport magazine, 7 December 2006 A new Smith Electric Vehicles production facility was built in Washington, Tyne and Wear, and was opened by Prime Minister Tony Blair in February 2007: \\"This will be a company that will really make its presence felt not just in the North East, but actually throughout the world.\\" In April of that year, Smith unveiled the Smith Edison. Based on the Ford Transit, it was the first electric light-commercial vehicle with a GVW of less than 3,500 kg ‚Äì meeting the \\"everyman\\" driving-license requirement of UK fleet operators. The first companies to deploy the Edison included the retailer Sainsbury's and the utility company Scottish & Southern Energy. TNT N.V. ordered a fleet of 50 Smith Newton trucks, after its successful trial of the first vehicle in 2006 trial, that month. Smith was one of several electric-commercial-vehicle companies invited to the Department for Transport (DfT) in London for discussions on how the UK government might help stimulate the market for commercial electric vehicles. This led to the announcement of the Low Carbon Vehicle Procurement Programme in the government's May 2007 Energy White Paper. During the summer of 2007, Smith produced its first vehicles for export (delivered to TNT N.V. in the Netherlands). In December, the company exhibited its Newton truck in North America and announced plans to establish a US production facility. =2008= In 2008, Smith appointed its first full-service distributor (Electric Vehicles Ireland). In April, Smith and Ford of Europe announced an \\"official collaboration\\" on the future development of commercial electric vehicles beginning with the Smith Ampere (an electric version of the Ford Transit Connect). By the end of June 2008, the Tanfield Group (Smith's parent company) reported the cancellation and postponement of customer orders. In November, Smith Electric was shortlisted for the Department for Transport's Low Carbon Vehicle Procurement Programme (a subsidy scheme which allowed public-sector organizations to buy electric and low-carbon vans for the same price as an equivalent diesel vehicle). Electric vehicle sales for 2008 were ¬£25.1 million, down from ¬£26.1 million in 2007. The Tanfield Group cited a combination of supply-chain constraints, fleet-operator spending reductions and a lack of available credit for the decline in sales. The Great Recession also impacted the company's plans to open a production facility in the US. =2009= After restructuring its operations in line with the downturn in demand, in February 2009 Tanfield announced the formation of Smith Electric Vehicles US Corp (Smith US): a joint venture which is 49-percent owned by Tanfield. The 51-percent majority share was owned by private investors and Smith US management. In addition to establishing an associate company in the US, Smith appointed distributors for sales and service in all foreign markets which were offering incentives for electric vehicles. Smith delivered its first Newton electric truck to Electric Vehicles Ireland, its distributor for the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, in March 2009. The vehicle was purchased by building materials retailer Grange Builders Providers of Dublin. This was followed by the appointment of AllGreenVehicles in the Netherlands as Smith's distributor for the Benelux countries. At the Geneva Motor Show, Ford exhibited its Tourneo Connect, a concept electric people-carrier version of the Ford Transit Connect. The prototype was produced by Smith. In 2009, the UK government began funding electric vehicles. Smith announced in June that it was a successful bidder for the Ultra Low Carbon Vehicle Demonstrator Programme (ULCVDP), administered by the Technology Strategy Board (TSB), which provided matching funds for the development of demonstration electric passenger vehicles. Smith announced that it would produce a seven-seat executive minibus; 10 London taxis based on LTI's TX4 chassis, and five people carriers similar to the concept Ford Tourneo Connect exhibited in Geneva. That month, the UK government confirmed that Smith was one of three electric-van manufacturers on the final shortlist of suppliers for the Low Carbon Vehicle Procurement Programme. In November, Tanfield announced that it was terminating its involvement in the electric Ford Transit Connect project in North America and Europe by mutual agreement with Ford. Smith cited the unexpected early success of its Newton electric truck in the US market; since Smith US had orders for 255 trucks, it decided to focus on the Newton. In Europe, Tanfield felt that the market for smaller vans was becoming too competitive. Smith UK appointed Sime Darby Motors its distributor for Hong Kong and Macau. It received repeat business from Sainsbury's, which ordered an additional 50 Smith Edison electric vans. Combined with Sainsbury's existing 20 electric vans, this created the world's largest fleet of new-technology electric commercial vehicles. Sales of electric vehicles declined from ¬£25.1 million to ¬£15.1 million in 2009. =2010= Barack Obama visited the Kansas City plant on 8 July 2010 to announce a $32 million grant under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, coupled with $36 million in private capital, to build up to 500 electric trucks. In 2010, the company supplied 10 Smith Edison vans to Ford of Europe for the colognE-mobil project in Cologne. The first phase of the project would examine the potential benefits of electric commercial vehicles in Cologne, then forecast how they might affect Germany's plans to deploy one million zero-emission vehicles by 2020. In March, ElecTruckCity was appointed as Smith's French distributor. Phase one of the UK's Low Carbon Vehicle Procurement Programme began in April. Smith received 67 percent of the orders for electric vans, more than double the total of orders received by the programme's other two electric-van suppliers (Modec and Allied Electric. At the UK's Commercial Vehicle Operator Show, the company celebrated its 90th anniversary. It announced SmithLink, the first telematics system for electric commercial vehicles. This provided real-time data on battery state of charge and vehicle location and the data monitoring required for government-funded projects from the United States Department of Energy and the UK's Department for Transport. The company introduced the UK's first all-electric 17-seat minibus at the CV Operator Show at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham. The Smith Edison minibus was based on the Ford Transit minibus chassis. =2011= In 2011, Smith's subsidiary in Kansas City, Missouri acquired the parent company for $15 million and moved its headquarters to Kansas City International Airport. The new company announced that it was exploring the potential of an initial public offering (IPO). Although Tanfield initially maintained 49-percent ownership of the company, the percentage was subject to dilution as SEV raised additional equity capital. Bryan Hansel was the company's CEO. The initial stock offering was not completed. =2013= Smith announced in June that it had over 700 vehicles deployed and over five million miles of operation. In August, Smith signed a letter of intent to form a joint venture with Taikang Technology Corporation in Taiwan for electric- vehicle assembly and distribution. The company deployed its first vehicle-to- grid (V2G) vehicles at Fort Carson, Colorado, in September. The deployment was part of the Smart Power Infrastructure Demonstration for Energy Reliability and Security (SPIDERS) project. Smith entered a letter of intent agreement the following month with battery supplier Sinopoly to develop markets in China and Taiwan. By the end of October, Tanfield's stake in Smith was less than six percent. =2014= In May, Smith reached an agreement with Hong Kong-based battery manufacturer Sinopoly Battery Limited intended to raise $40 million for the firm. On 9 June, the company introduced Italy's first all-electric commercial truck. The Italian version of the Newton was delivered to Niinivirta Transport at a ceremony in Milan. In August 2014, Smith purchased a small Colorado company (listed on the OTC Bulletin Board) for $340,000 as part of its strategy to become a public company. That month, a UK subsidiary separated (as SEV) in a management buyout to focus on the European maintenance and service sector. =2016= After many years of poor trading, Smith's UK arms were shut down. This included Smith Electric Vehicles (Europe), which was placed under administration, and Smith Technologies (which was liquidated). =2017= In February 2017, the company ceased operation due to lack of funding; however, its board was attempting to obtain financing for a reorganization. Vehicles=Newton truck= Smith Newton electric truck at the 2010 Autotec exhibition at the Brno Exhibition Centre Introduced in 2006, the Newton electric truck was Smith's first produced, new-technology, electric commercial vehicle. The Newton was available in three GVW ratings: 7,500 kg, 10,000 kg and 12,000 kg. Each was available in a short, medium or long wheelbase. The truck was powered by a 120 kilowatt electric permanent-magnet motor and driven by lithium-ion iron-phosphate batteries with A123 Systems modules. Smith offered 80 or 120 kWh battery packs. Customers in Europe included TNT Express, TK Maxx, DHL, Balfour Beatty, Bunzl, A.G. Barr, the Office of Public Works in Ireland and Celtic Linen in Dublin. Smith Newton electric van operated by TNT Express in Oxford, England Frito-Lay was a major US customer, with 176 Newton delivery trucks in operation by January 2011 (about one percent of Frito-Lay's total fleet). Other American customers included Coca-Cola, AT&T;, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E;), Staples and the U.S. Marine Corps. Newton was named Green Commercial of the Year in the electric-vehicle section of Fleet Transport magazine's Irish Truck of the Year Awards 2010, sponsored by Castrol. The Newton was sold worldwide in October 2012 and available with three payload capacities, from . The lithium- ion battery pack was available in several sizes, with a range of and a top speed of . =Step-Van= In March 2012, Smith announced the Newton Step-Van: an all-electric, zero-emission vehicle built on the Newton platform with a walk-in body produced by Indiana-based Utilimaster Corporation. =Edison= Smith Edison electric vans at the University of Warwick, England The Smith Edison was the world's first electric van with a GVW of under 3,500 kg ‚Äì a critical factor, because vehicles over 3,500 kg require a commercial driving licence. Edison, like any van under 3,500 kg, can be driven by anyone with a regular UK licence. The Edison was sold worldwide, except in the US. It was available as a chassis cab, delivery van and minibus, with a capacity varying from . The delivery van was sold with several lithium-ion battery packs, with a range of 55 to 100 mi (90 to 160 km) and a top speed of . The Edison, based on the Ford Transit chassis, was powered by a 90 kW induction motor from Enova Systems and a 40 or 51kWh lithium-ion iron phosphate battery pack from Valence Technology. In November 2009, the Edison was one of the Irish Motoring Writers Association's top five Vans of the Year. In December 2009, it was named the 2010 Eco Van of the Year by What Van magazine. In 2012, the Edison was upgraded to use the Ford Transit Stage 5 variant. Customers were in Russia (Revolta), Netherlands (Spijkstaal), Taiwan (Taikang), Hong Kong (CLP, FedEx), the UK, Sweden (FuelReduce) and Abu Dhabi. It was discontinued in 2014. =London taxi= LTI and Smith produced the TX4E, an all-electric version of LTI's TX4 black taxicab. Smith built the first 10 TX4Es as part of the UK government's Ultra Low Carbon Vehicle Demonstrator Programme. The vehicles were not commercially successful, and the practicality of an electric taxi has been disputed. According to Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association general secretary Bob Oddy, \\"Only about 40 percent of London cabbies will be able to work a full eight-hour shift on a 100-mile charge.\\" =Ampere= The Smith Ampere was based on the Ford Transit Connect chassis. Smith produced a European prototype in 2008 and a US version the following year, after Smith US signed an agreement with Ford Motor Company in February 2009. The van was to be assembled for the North American market in the former Trans World Airlines maintenance hangar at Kansas City International Airport, and in the UK for the European market. That month, Smith US announced that it would join Humvee manufacturer AM General to produce a prototype electric delivery vehicle for the United States Postal Service. The company terminated its agreement with Ford in November of that year. Research and development Smith Electric Vehicles developed driveline enhancements and ancillary systems for commercial electric vehicles, including heating and air conditioning. The company estimated that the technology could increase electric-vehicle range by up to 20 percent. In February 2010, Smith announced that it was working with Germany's Proton Power Systems to incorporate a fuel cell into its Smith Newton truck. The small fuel cell would act as a mini-generator, topping up the batteries and possibly doubling vehicle range. SmithLink SmithLink arose from the desire to understand how a fleet of all-electric vehicles performs under a variety of conditions, such as topology, temperature and driving style. In 2010, a team was formed to design a system for the collection and processing of data to aid product development. SmithLink was rolled out on several key UK and US fleets. When SmithLink began, there was no secure and reliable transmission protocol for high-volume data transmission over public networks (the data portions of the mobile GPRS spectrum). Smith worked with the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) working group and OASIS to define a standard protocol for messaging interoperability. SmithLink was one of the first heavy users of the AMQP protocol for telemetry transmission. By 2014, the system has been installed in over 800 vehicles worldwide; in March of that year, SmithLink had recorded over of 8.5 million miles of data on its electric trucks. Smith US The Tanfield Group announced the formation of the Smith Electric Vehicles US Corporation (Smith US) in February 2009, and the company opened for business later that year. It was the US' leading manufacturer of electric trucks. Tanfield owned 49 percent of Smith US, with the remaining 51 percent owned by private investors. The US- majority ownership qualified the company for federal and state funding and incentives for electric trucks. Smith US owned the rights to produce and market Tanfield's commercial electric vehicles under the Smith brand. Tanfield licensed its electric-vehicle technology to Smith, in exchange for a royalty fee per vehicle sold by Smith US. Smith US produced the Smith Newton all- electric truck in Classes 3-7.Smith Electric Extends Industry Lead Newton Platform - ser-us.com - Retrieved 3 August 2010 The Newton has a top speed of , a range of up to on a single charge, and is powered by lithium-ion batteries. In July 2009, Smith US delivered its first Newton trucks at a ceremony on Capitol Hill presided over by Missouri Senator Kit Bond. Its first six customers were Coca-Cola, Frito-Lay, AT&T;, Staples, Pacific Gas & Electric and Kansas City Power & Light. The initial six vehicles were produced at Smith UK's facility in Washington, Tyne and Wear and shipped to Missouri in kit form for final assembly. That month, the Department of Energy awarded $10 million to Smith US for a fleet of trial vehicles for major US corporations.U.S. Department of Energy Awards Smith Electric Vehicle $20 Million Grant = sev-us.com - Retrieved 3 August 2010 Commerce Secretary Gary Locke made the grant announcement in Kansas City during a visit to Kansas City Power & Light. By October, Smith US had recruited and trained the nucleus of its workforce and Newton trucks began rolling off the production line in Kansas City. The Newton became the first all-electric truck on the US General Services Administration (GSA) schedule, a list of products approved for purchase by federal agencies and the US military, in January 2010. The agencies spend a combined $1 billion annually on GSA-approved vehicles and automotive services. At the end of March 2010, US Senator Claire McCaskill announced that the Department of Energy was awarding an additional $22 million, allowing Smith US to increase its build program to more than 500 Newton trucks. Smith had its corporate headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri. The company's engineering centre of excellence was in Washington, Tyne and Wear. Smith US made a ¬£37 million conditional offer, equating to 50p per Tanfield share plus a \\"free\\" share in Smith US if it made an initial public offering and joined the stock market in the near future. to buy out the Smith UK operation and create a company separate from the Tanfield Group. Tanfield gave Smith US a four-month period of exclusivity, giving the American company until July to raise the requisite funding and make a firm offer. After President Barack Obama's visit to the Kansas City plant on 8 July, the exclusivity period was extended 60 days to September 2010. Preservation Five battery-electric vehicles produced by Smith have been preserved in the collection of the Transport Museum, Wythall near Birmingham, England. A model S65 operated by Walsall & District Co-op and a model SS operated by Handsworth Dairies date to 1957. A pair of two-ton models operated by Walsall & District Co-op and Nottingham Co-op date to 1958 and 1959, and the fifth vehicle is a 1969 commuter mail van operated by the General Post Office. The Ipswich Transport Museum has a 1948 Smith milk float operated by the Ipswich Co- operative Society in its collection, and three vehicles used for door-to-door vegetable sales. Built in 1965, they were retired in 2001 and donated to the museum by the co-op in 2002.

The film is based on the novel by Richard Gordon. It is the sixth of the seven films in the Doctor series. The film was released in the US as Carnaby, MD. Synopsis The film is based at the (fictitious) St Swithin's Hospital, with Leslie Phillips as Dr Gaston Grimsdyke, an accident-prone doctor and cad, more interested in the nurses than the patients. Grimsdyke is sacked from his job as a medical officer at a men's prison, for his misbehaviour with the Governor's daughter, so he enrolls in a refresher course with his old medical tutor Sir Lancelot Spratt (James Robertson Justice), who is determined to make him a successful surgeon. Grimsdyke discovers that a plum senior medical post is shortly to become vacant, and starts scheming to be considered, instead of his cousin, who has already been unofficially offered the job. Spratt and the newly appointed hospital matron clash, leading Spratt to 'volunteer' Grimsdyke to romance her and 'soften her up'. But she mistakenly believes Spratt to be her admirer, and many funny and inevitable complications ensue. At a hospital dance, a 'rejuvenation serum' which Grimsdyke has accidentally injected into Sir Lancelot, causes the latter to run amok at the party and romance the new matron. She decides to resign and a new matron is appointed. But she turns out to be equally opposed to Spratt's ideas of how the hospital should be run.

Film rights were bought by the Rank Organisation whose head of production Earl St John announced the film for production in 1961. However it took a number of years for the film to be made. The film was formally announced in 1964, one of a series of comedies that Rank were making at the time (others including Carry on Cleo and Love on the Riviera). The film was shot in Carnaby Street, Wormwood Scrubs and Pinewood Studios. The opening credits include the following acknowledgement: We are grateful for the help and facilities given at Wexham Park Hospital by the staff of the Hospital, Humphreys Ltd. and The Windsor Group Hospital Management Committee. While the film was shown at its full 101 minutes duration in most other countries, the British Board of Film Classification ordered that the UK cinema version had to be cut down to 97 minutes in order to get an \\"A\\" (adult) classification, and that duration has remained in later British video releases.BBFC: Doctor in Clover (1965) Linked 2013-05-16 Reception The film opened in London on 4 March 1966, with general release following on 3 April. =Critical= \\"The title alone will go a long way towards selling this picture\\", noted Graham Clarke in Kinematograph Weekly, \\"and it backs this with a good ration of knockabout fun.\\"Kinematograph Weekly vol 585 no 3048, 3 March 1966 =Box office= The film was among the 15 top money-makers at the British box-office that year.The Times, 31 December 1966, article: Most popular star for third time, page 5, column G.

Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 10 March 2016Marten van Cleve (I) at The Netherlands Institute for Art History Van Cleve is mainly known for his genre scenes with peasants and landscapes, which show a certain resemblance with the work of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Marten van Cleve was one of the leading Flemish artists of his generation. His subjects and compositions were an important influence on the work of Pieter Brueghel the Younger and other genre painters of his generation.Marten van Cleve I (Antwerp c. 1527-before 1581), The Massacre of the Innocents at Christie's Life Details about the life of Marten van Cleve are scarce. He was born in Antwerp as the son of Willem van Cleve the Elder who had become a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1518.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 294-297 Based on his own declaration in a document dated 2 April 1567 that he was then 40 years of age, it is assumed van Cleve was born in 1526 or 1527.B.

Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 5 August 2019. Outdoor wedding dance Marten van Cleve first studied under his father. According to the early Flemish biographer Karel van Mander Marten van Cleve studied under Frans Floris, the leading Flemish history painter in the mid 16th century. There is no evidence for this apprenticeship. Some stylistic similarities with Frans Floris' works that appear in van Cleve's early work and the engravings after his inventions make the apprenticeship plausible. Van Mander also stated that van Cleve did not follow the 16th century trend of Flemish painters to study in Italy. This may explain why van Cleve's work does not show the influence of Italian Mannerism with its unrealistic deformations.Giorgio T. Faggin, De genre-schilder Marten van Cleef, in: Oud Holland, Vol. 80, No. 1 (1965), pp. 34-43, 45-46 Marten van Cleve became a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1551. Marten van Cleve married Maria de Greve on 7 January 1556. The couple had four sons named Gillis, Marten (called 'Marten the Younger), Joris and Nicolaas who all became painters. Marten van Cleve had five registered pupils, one of whom became a master. One of his pupils may have been Hans Jordaens. Slaughtered ox Between 1560 and 1570 Marten van Cleve operated an important workshop with a large output. The majority of the works were copies of Marten's original inventions. It is probable that his own sons also assisted in his studio. Van Cleve was a regular collaborator with a number of prominent landscape painters. Marten van Cleve Marten died in 1581, at which time he was suffering from gout and rheumatism.Marten van Cleve, A wedding procession at Johnny van Haeften Work Marten van Cleve was principally a genre painter, who specialized in peasant scenes and landscapes. Only about five of his works are signed and properly documented. He depicted predominantly low-life scenes of peasant weddings and dances, kermisses, brawling peasants and soldiers and plundering soldiers, which show his debt to the work of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. As the artist only left few signed works, the attributions of works to him has been difficult and several attributions have been rejected in recent years. Even the attributions by Dr. Klaus Ertz in his catalogue raisonn√© of Marten van Cleve's paintings and drawings published in 2014 have been questioned. Farm interior with important visitors His oldest authenticated work is the Farm interior with important visitors (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), which was included in the 1659 inventory of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria. It is regarded as a youth work and shows the large kitchen of a farm. A couple from the city are in the kitchen to visit their child which they have entrusted to a wet nurse. The work, which is probably dated to around 1555‚Äì1560, shows the influence of Frans Floris in its fluid brush stroke. The choice of subject matter was likely influenced by Pieter Aertsen's peasant scenes from the period 1550‚Äì1560. Unlike Aertsen, van Cleve's treatment of space is more modern and his work is free of the influence of the Manierism of the Flemish Romanists who were inspired by contemporary Italian art. The influence of Pieter Brueghel the Elder is not yet visible in this early work. The blessing of the bridal bed Van Cleve came under the influence of Pieter Bruegel the Elder's work in the 1560s. It is a certain resemblance with the work of Bruegel (particularly in the numbers of figures depicted), which has led to the often unjustifiable categorization of van Cleve as a follower of Bruegel. He was, however, never an imitator of that master. He took from Bruegel certain subjects and peasant types but was not interested in following some of the reactionary aspects of Bruegel's work such as the return to Hieronymus Bosch's surrealism and Joachim Patinir's world landscapes. On the whole van Cleve's scenes are descriptive rather than allegorical.Marten van Cleve, The Good Shepherd at Sotheby's Van Cleve attempted to correct or modernize Bruegel by a higher level of interest in realism. He also depicted his scenes from a lower viewpoint than Bruegel. Another confirmed authentic work is the Slaughtered ox (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna),which is monogrammed with 'M(v)G' in ligature and dated 1566. It is quite similar to a work of a Slaughtered pig by Joachim Beukelaer. While Beuckelaer's work is clearly a still life, van Cleve's composition is a genre work which emphasizes the anecdotal and genre aspects of the work. Van Cleve's composition may also have an allegorical meaning. A little boy sitting on the threshold of the door is blowing a bubble. The bubble is in fact the bladder of the ox, at the time a children's toy. It is possible that the bubble-blowing boy is a reference to the homo bulla motive, the idea that life is just a bubble that only lasts a very short time. The dead ox itself is a reminder of death and is thus linked to the 'memento mori' idea, the notion that humans should remember that they are mortal.Niels Bergervoet, Rembrandt and the Slaughtered Ox Together with the Carnival in a village with beggars dancing dated 1579 (Hermitage Museum), the Slaughtered ox shows that van Cleve preferred a broad and free brushstroke. In the Carnival in a village with beggars dancing van Cleve has also used various motifs from Pieter Bruegel the Elder's works. A visit to the wet nurse Van Cleve developed a number of new themes such as the King Drinks, the original of which is probably the painting sold at Kunsthandel Abels, Cologne in 1965. This theme invented by van Cleve became very popular in the next century. His 'The good shepherd' was another original creation, which was widely imitated. Many Flemish artists, and in particular Pieter Bruegel the Younger, were inspired by these subjects. Marten van Cleve is believed to have been an important influence on the development of Pieter Brueghel the Younger's style, along the more widely recognised precedent of his father, Pieter Bruegel the Elder. The peasant wedding was a favourite theme of Cleve. He returned frequently to this subject depicting its various rituals and ceremonies, mostly in the form of cycles of small-scale panels. His Wedding Procession was widely copied by his workshop as well as Pieter Bruegel the Younger. Another popular theme of van Cleve was The Massacre of the Innocents and his version of this subject was copied even more frequently than the version of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. The attribution to van Cleve and his workshop of the various versions of the Massacre of the Innocents has been questioned on stylistic grounds, in particular on the basis of the fact that the more painterly handling of paint that is ascribed to van Cleve is missing in this body of work. Carnival in a village with beggars dancing Marten van Cleve collaborated with many prominent landscape painters, including Gillis van Coninxloo, Gillis Mostaert and Jacob Grimmer as well as his brother Hendrick for whom he painted the figures. Hendrick reciprocated and added to Marten's figure-pieces landscape backgrounds. To Marten van Cleve have been attributed a lot of designs for prints published by the Antwerp printers and publishers including Willem van Haecht. It is believed that while apprenticed in the workshop of Frans Floris, Marten van Cleve assisted in the preparation of print designs after preliminary drawings made by Frans Floris. An example is van Cleve's signed drawing of Arachne (c. 1574, Kupferstichkabinett Berlin) made after Floris' design. This drawing was then used by Philip Galle as the basis for his engraving of Arachne or The textile industry. In his prints, van Cleve remained closer to his master Floris's designs.Edward H.

The show follows the hot talk format, which brought Leykis much success, particularly in the Southern California radio market. Due to the provocative nature of the show, Leykis has often been described as a shock jock. The show's best-known feature is \\"Leykis 101\\", in which he purports to teach men how to get sex while spending the least amount of time, money, and effort. Early life Tom Leykis was born August 1, 1956, at a time when his parents, Harry and Laura (n√©e O'Mara),Newsday (November 24, 1998) Obituaries: Laura G. (nee O'Mara) Leykis Section: News; Page A60. lived in the Bronx.New York Daily News (October 9, 1995) Obituary: Harry Leykis Section: News; Page 28. Leykis spent his early childhood in The Bronx, New York City, New York and has two sisters (Terry, Anne) and a brother (Jim). Leykis is of Irish and Jewish descent. His Jewish grandfather, who originated in Kiev, Ukraine, emigrated to Lithuania and later to the United States at the turn of the 20th century. Tom Leykis has repeatedly stated that his lineage is irrelevant to his life and his accomplishments in the radio business. His father was a union leader at The New York Post. At a point in Leykis' childhood, he moved with his family to Selden, Long Island, where he completed high school and graduated at 16 from Newfield High School. He then moved away from the family home to study broadcasting at Fordham University and dropped out due to financial issues. Career Leykis began his radio career in the state of New York in 1970. At the age of 14, he was once a fill-in host for WBAB later working in 1979 for Mark Simone's WPIX-FM talk show comedy titled The Simone Phone where he was featured as the host's sidekick. In the mid-1970s Leykis hosted one of the first public access TV shows on Long Island's Cablevision system, \\"The Graffiti Hour\\", a call-in program. Leykis eventually left WPIX, later went to WBAI leaving in the fall of 1981 to go to Albany to work at WQBK. Leykis also contributed to a show called The Phonebooth on WABC that ended in 1981. After his departure from WABC, Leykis was offered a full-time radio hosting job in Staunton, Virginia. Leykis credits his defining moment to seriously pursue a career in radio to an incident that occurred in the early 1980s, in which his then-girlfriend locked him out of their residence because she believed he didn't earn enough money; he has since stated that this was one of the most important events of his life.10 Questions with ... Tom Leykis A few years later, Leykis appeared on an episode of 20/20 where she contacted his show in an attempt to resume their relationship and he declined. On Monday, February 27, 1984, The Tom Leykis Show aired on WNWS in Miami to replace the WNWS night show hosted by talk radio personality Neil Rogers.Fisher, Marc. (February 29, 1984) Miami Herald Acerbic radio star allowed to take act to other station. Section: Local; Page 1D. Rogers, who had previously signed conflicting employment contracts with both WNWS (790 AM) and WINZ (940 AM), had just won permission from a Miami court to take his act to WINZ and hoped leaving WNWS would be devastating to Leykis' program. Rogers and Leykis became rivals and, in June 1984, just after Denver radio talk show host Alan Berg was assassinated, Leykis told listeners Neil Rogers' real name and urged callers to harass his on-air rival. By January 1985, Leykis had the top-ranking evening talk show in the market.Thornton, Linda R. (January 19, 1985) Miami Herald Every group has its own taste in radio stations. Section: Comics/TV; Page 4C. In September 1985, Leykis abruptly left his WNWS job over concern about the pending WNWS-WGBS merger and began work at Phoenix's KFYI.Thornton, Linda R. (September 13, 1985) Miami Herald Missing WNWS Host found ‚Äì on the air in Arizona. Section; Comics/TV; Page 10C. As program director at KFYI, Leykis constructed a politically well-rounded host lineup inserting himself as a \\"left leaning libertarian\\" in the afternoons. Leykis was known for his method of gathering new callers for the station by provoking rival station KTAR. In 1987, Leykis abruptly left KFYI because of differences with station management that still has a shroud of secrecy surrounding the details. As of the late 1990s, KFYI hosts were prohibited from discussing the details of Leykis' departure from the station. While still in Phoenix, Leykis also had a local Public-access television show called Backstage Pass. After leaving Phoenix, Leykis moved on to Los Angeles to work for KFI, where he hosted a talk-radio program from 1988 to 1992, as a liberal counterpart to Rush Limbaugh. During this time, KFI was hit with a $6,000 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) indecency fine over Leykis' on-air comments; however, the fine was paid in full from contributions by listeners. During Leykis' tenure at KFI, KFI host Geoff Edwards was suspended and then resigned over an incident related to steamrolling a massive collection of Cat Stevens' work sent in by listeners, which was motivated by Leykis' denouncement of Cat Stevens' comments about Salman Rushdie. A local Nazi historian likened the stunt as being reminiscent of a Nazi book burning. On September 29, 1992, KFI management dismissed Leykis with only an hour's notice, based on what Leykis claims they called \\"a business decision\\"; KFI assumed the obligation of paying him his contracted salary, estimated at $400,000 per year, for the remaining six months of his contract. Leykis next moved on to Boston and WRKO. He later left the Boston station for a new job in Los Angeles after a publicized domestic disturbance with then-wife Susan at the end of 1993. In March 1994, pretrial probation was granted and the charges stemming from that assault were dropped in exchange for his attendance in a program for batterers. In 1994, Leykis began the nationally syndicated program, The Tom Leykis Show on Westwood One from Culver City, California. The final years of the show were produced from Paramount Pictures studios in Hollywood. Leykis' started the Internet streamcast network The New Normal Network, featuring streams like New Normal Music, in July 2010. The Tom Leykis Show=History= The Tom Leykis Show began in 1994 broadcasting from KMPC in Los Angeles.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Other-Documments/LA- Radio-Guide/LA-Radio-Guide-1994-06-07.pdf Originally the show was often political in nature, a fact Leykis highlighted at the start of every episode by proclaiming his show the only radio talk show that is \\"not hosted by a right-wing wacko or a convicted felon\\", references to radio hosts Rush Limbaugh and G. Gordon Liddy, respectively. In addition to politics, the host commonly discussed relationships, religion (Leykis is an atheist), and other issues. On Fridays, listeners were allowed to call in and talk about anything they wanted, in contrast to other days when Leykis established a single topic for each hour of the show. Friday was also the usual day for live appearances in cities around the U.S., when Leykis would broadcast from a bar or other public place with an audience present. The free-for-all subject matter and large crowds led to a rowdy atmosphere on Friday shows, and it was in this context that \\"Flash Fridays\\" began. In 1997, Leykis's show was picked up by KLSX, an FM talk station in Los Angeles that also carried The Howard Stern Show. The station became the flagship for the show and Leykis began to tone down the political aspect of the show around this time, and started the \\"Leykis 101\\" segment soon after. In 2002, The Tom Leykis Show was briefly heard on an irregular basis in New York City on WNEW. Leykis was moved to afternoons from nights to replace the recently fired Opie and Anthony of The Opie and Anthony Show. Leykis later reflected on his comparative lack of success in the New York market, explaining that the station never truly got behind him, \\"We were talking to [WNEW Show Director Mark Chernoff] about the show being on the station on a regular basis. He said, \\"This show will never work in New York.\\" Now, that may be true or it may not be true but how do you know until the people have had a chance to listen to it?\\". In addition to his weekday show, Leykis began hosting a new syndicated weekend show called The Tasting Room in February 2005, covering lifestyle topics such as wine and spirits, luxury cars, and high-end technology. With the departure of Howard Stern to satellite radio in January 2006, KLSX became known on-air as \\"97.1 Free FM\\" ‚Äì so-called to highlight that its stations broadcast free-to-air, funded by commercials, whereas satellite radio requires a subscription fee. The station was produced by CBS Radio as part of its Free FM format, and The Tom Leykis Show was broadcast in a number of affiliate markets nationwide including but not limited to Portland, Dallas, Seattle, Phoenix, Las Vegas as well as multiple California markets in addition to its Los Angeles flagship such as San Diego and San Francisco. Talkers Magazine, analyzing Arbitron data, show that Leykis has an estimated listening minimum weekly cume of over 1.75 million for Spring 2007, based on a national sample. On February 20, 2009, KLSX changed its format to Top 40 (CHR) under economic pressures, and The Tom Leykis Show aired its final broadcast. The show ran Monday through Friday, 3:00 PM to 8:00 PM PT from Paramount Studios and 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM Saturdays in Hollywood, California and was heard in a number of major metropolitan markets on the West Coast of the United States. Leykis's show returned on his podcast/streamcast network The New Normal Network at 3PM Pacific time, April 2, 2012 ‚Äì one day after his CBS contract ended. The new uncensored show included a new theme song, fewer commercials, and \\"Leykis 101\\" news at the top of each hour. The new show was financed through both advertising and a premium subscription service that offers a less-compressed stream and podcast-on-demand ability. It was produced by Gary Zabransky along with associate producer Dean \\"Dino\\" DeMilio, and engineered by Mike Timpson, who replaced Art Webb after his departure in 2013. In February 2018, Tom Leykis announced that he would be ending his live show that year. The final live episode aired on October 25, 2018. On October 13, 2018, Leykis announced a new podcast series that would be exclusive to his subscribers on his premiumtom.com website. His new podcasting venture commenced on October 29, 2018. =Format= Typically, Leykis discusses one topic per hour. He will introduce the topic by reading a news article or peer-reviewed study, or by discussing a personal anecdote or experience. He will then accept callers for discussion and debate. The cornerstone of the program was the Thursday broadcast of \\"Leykis 101\\", in which the program is set up as an ad hoc lecture and question and answer session, over which Leykis presides as a self-styled \\"professor\\". The subject of the \\"101\\" segments are how men can spend less money on women, while achieving greater sexual and personal success. The intent of his advice is to serve as a father figure for his mostly-men listeners. Thus, many callers address Leykis as \\"Dad\\" or \\"Father\\". Along with general information on life for young men, Leykis's 101 advice mostly consists of his principles of looking out for oneself. He argues that the institution of marriage is flawed and that family court systems are often corrupt because DNA testing after childbirth is not mandatory to prevent paternity fraud,Paternity Fraud by Tom Leykis and because courts have forced men to pay child support even after DNA testing has established that a man was not actually a child's father. Other examples of Leykis 101 guidelines include never dating single mothers or co-workers; never cohabiting with a woman; using birth control during each sexual encounter; and immediately ending a relationship if a woman issues an ultimatum. Leykis constantly recommends that young men pursue their career or educational goals and avoid being distracted by serious relationships or marriage at a young age as he was. Leykis describes many women as \\"dream killers\\"See Leykis's 08 August 2007 segment \\"Chicks Kill Business Dreams\\" (i.e., he argues that, in dating or marriage, women will typically prioritize their desires above a man's, and will actively discourage men's ambitions for fear of him leaving the relationship if he attains success). Furthermore, Leykis urges men to live frugally, including avoiding consumer debt (what Leykis describes as \\"renting money\\"); never spending more than $40 for a date; and saving cash and investing for the future.See Leykis's 12 December 2006 segment \\"You Need to Think Rich\\". He has described men who neglect their bills as \\"immoral\\".See Leykis's 05 January 2009 segment \\"Tom's Money Advice\\" =Features= A popular and long-running feature of the show is \\"Flash Friday\\", in which men are encouraged to drive with their headlights on and women are encouraged to expose their breasts to such vehicles. The feature began as a one-time bit; while on the air, Leykis recalled a radio host he listened to as a child, who asked his listeners in New York apartments to flash their lights on and off and then to look outside to see how many neighbors were doing the same, as a way to gauge the audience size (Jean Shepherd).Excelsior, You Fathead ! by Eugene B. Bergmann Leykis asked his listeners to do the same with their car headlights, and a few minutes later, jokingly suggested that women flash their breasts. A listener called in to report that he saw a woman flashing fellow drivers, and it became a regular feature of the show. Both women and men commonly call during the Friday broadcast to alert other listeners as to their location, and to recount stories of flashing or being flashed, respectively. =Lawsuits= In July 1998, Tom Leykis and the production company Westwood One were sued by Karen Carpenter of Juneau, Alaska. She claimed to have suffered post-traumatic stress from disparaging and sexual comments Leykis made about her on the air. Leykis has stated on air that the case occupied much of his attention in the winter of 2002. On June 25, 2003, Marty Ingels, a voice actor, called into Leykis's show and tried to challenge him on moral grounds. Ingels, who was much older than the typical caller to Leykis's show, was subjected to some rude remarks by the call screener who said that he was too old and should not be on the air. But Ingels was placed on the air, and Leykis also disparaged Ingels, stating \\"you're not just older than my demographic, you're the grandfather of my demographic\\". Leykis explained that he didn't want older callers because he was selling advertising aimed at younger listeners. Ingels sued the show for age discrimination. Ingels's first lawsuit got dismissed by an anti-SLAPP statute (CCP S 425.16) that protected against lawsuits that protects First Amendment rights and another judge claimed that the show had the right to control its content. Further, it was noted that Ingels could not really complain he was discriminated against because his call was in fact put on the air.Excerpts from the Ingels call: SV Media Law website. Retrieved on March 5, 2008. As for Ingels, the actor was ordered to pay $25,000 in attorney's fees to Leykis.Hastings, Hon. J. Gary.

(review denied August 24, 2005 by the California Supreme Court) On-air murder confession Another widely publicized event took place in November 2006, when Leykis invited callers to make confessions about their wrongdoing or escapades which were never discovered. A listener from the Phoenix, Arizona area called the show and confessed to shooting the father of her child when he refused to pay child support. The caller described herself as a nurse who went by her middle name, Sue, and said that she shot the man in the heart with a 9 mm because she \\"knew how to aim for it\\", and moreover asserted that she made the shooting look like a suicide. Leykis asked if the woman was serious, and the woman explained how she \\"got away with it\\" because police believed \\"a blubbering, crying woman\\" and that she was never arrested or charged. Leykis informed her that she had made a murder confession live on the air, that the call-screener had her phone number, and that they would turn her information over to police. The woman ended her call. Leykis denied allegations that the call was part of a hoax set up by the show, and producers turned over all information they had about the caller to police who began an investigation. Leykis discussed the confession on subsequent episodes of his show, urging listeners to phone a toll-free number if they had possibly relevant information, and offering a cash reward for information leading to conviction of the woman for murder. About a month later, former talk show host Geraldo Rivera asked Leykis about the incident on his Geraldo at Large syndicated television program.Rivera, Geraldo. (December 26, 2006) FOX 5 WNYW- NY Geraldo at Large 18:00 Geraldo: \\"So what was your first reaction when you got this call?\\" Leykis: \\"I was shocked. You know, people call talk shows and say all kinds of things, but they never confess to murder.\\" On August 7, 2008, Leykis interviewed an officer involved in the investigation. Evidence was presented to the Maricopa County Attorney's Office and charges were considered against Megan Suzanne Vice of El Mirage, Arizona.Eastvalleytribune.com Her ex-boyfriend, Tortsen Rockwood, died of a gunshot wound in 2001, and, while the death was originally ruled a suicide, police later named Vice as their suspect in the case. Sometime after the murder confession was made on Leykis's show, Vice filed a police report stating that her cell phone had been stolen. In 2009, it was revealed that police reviewed the death of Rockwood and determined that all the evidence was consistent with suicide and that Vice would not be charged with murder; however, she was charged with filing a false police report for claiming that her cell phone was stolen.Azcentral.comWJFK.com Naming names In 2003, Leykis raised controversy by revealing the name of Katelyn Faber, the accuser in the Kobe Bryant sexual assault case. Other media outlets elected to reveal details of the alleged victim such as race and masked photographs while excluding her name, as was the standard practice at that time,See also Rape shield law. raising privacy questions. Major media outlets generally and voluntarily withhold names like these due to their adherence to journalism ethics and standards. However, the policy in practice only applies to alleged victims, allowing for the release of names of alleged offenders, a policy which Leykis disagrees with and does not follow, as he regularly states he is \\"not a journalist\\". Leykis contends that either all names in a case (the alleged offender(s) and the alleged accuser) should be protected or all should be public. The radio show host has caused considerable controversy over the years for his practice of identifying such individuals by name on-air. Other such individuals he has named include: * Vanessa Perhach, who accused Marv Albert of forcible sodomy (biting) in 1997. * Angela Song, a woman associated with the Christian Coalition of America who tried to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge in Seattle, Washington. * An accused child molester in SeaTac, Washington. * Vili Fualaau, the 13-year-old victim of statutory rape by teacher Mary Kay Letourneau. * Kenneth Pinyan, the Boeing Co. employee dropped off at a Seattle hospital dead from a perforated colon, later found to have engaged in bestial sexual intercourse with a horse. * Crystal Mangum, a stripper, escort,Alexandria Harper, Woman behind Duke lacrosse scandal speaks out , The A&T; Register, April 28, 2008.

Among the 81 radio stations in Southern California the show was #9 overall, #6 in English stations, and #1 for time spent listening. Among men ages 18+, adults ages 18‚Äì34, and \\"the money demo\\" ages 25‚Äì54, the show was #1 in time spent listening with an average of over 4 hours per week, in addition to being #1 in share for men aged 18+. =End of terrestrial radio broadcast= The Tom Leykis Show had its last regular terrestrial broadcast on Friday, February 20, 2009, and ended at 5 p.m., the middle of its usual time slot. Leykis took calls until the last five minutes. At that point, the host mentioned that people had asked him how he was going to end the show. Saying \\"Let's tell the truth\\", Leykis commented that he knew since the previous summer that it was possible the flagship station (KLSX, which originated the broadcast of the show) would switch format. Saying he \\"tossed and turned\\", he thought about it and asked himself: \\"What could I say that would wrap this all up? And then one day I heard this song ‚Ä¶ and I realized ‚Äì the lyrics of this song ‚Ä¶ are about me.\\" With that, Leykis rolled into Joe Jackson's \\"I'm the Man\\" (the title track of Jackson's 1979 album). By the time the song was over, the studio was filled with people‚Äîas could be seen by the live online video broadcast on the station website. The host thanked his producers, the program director, the crowd in the studio, and everyone in southern California who made it \\"12 great years\\", and he finished with \\"Let's do this thing one more time...\\" The crowd yelled \\"Blow me up, Tom\\" one last time to end the show and mark the end of KLSX as \\"The FM Talk Station\\" in what coincidentally became a strikingly appropriate catch phrase to be had: The phrase \\"blow up the station\\" is a radio term for ending a particular format or station run. After a much longer than usual explosion sound effect, the crowd cheered and KLSX changed format from hot talk to CHR/Top 40.\\"Tom Leykis' Myspace Blog\\" , Myspace. Retrieved on February 19, 2009. =New Normal Network= When Leykis's show went off the air in 2009, he was in the middle of a five-year contract with CBS. This contract included the rights to his show over terrestrial radio, internet rights, and specific to airing on KLSX; this kept Leykis from appearing on any other CBS station. In addition, CBS also would not allow podcasts for them, as they were concentrating on other online ventures at the time. Despite all this, Leykis has no regrets over his contract terms, and still speaks highly of CBS. During his show's hiatus, he created The New Normal Network in 2010 including the Gary and Dino Show.newnormalnetwork.com The network has also at times held multiple music streams, in order to take the media into his own hands. After setting up his new network, Leykis announced on the network's website that his show would return on April 2, 2012, one day after the conclusion of his contract with CBS. On the first day of the show's return, there were some streaming issues that were rectified within the first 30 minutes, due to a far greater influx of listeners that he was expecting. After receiving data from his analytic sources, Leykis announced on the air that in the first week of the show, over 401,000 different IP addresses tuned into the show. During live broadcasts, The Tom Leykis Show is the top internet radio talk show in the world, as well as the number two internet radio station in the world, according to SHOUTcast.\\"Art Webb\\", Twitter. Retrieved on September 27, 2012. On September 25, 2018, Leykis announced the end of his online stream and Internet call-in radio show would be on October 25, 2018. He claims there will be some form of podcast behind a paywall because of the freeloaders who never supported his Premium Tom paid podcast subscriptions. For some time there was a counter tracking the number of subscriptions above 1900, which was the minimum required for the New Normal LLC to remain profitable.https://www.premiumtom.com/library/daily-show/2018-09-25 The Tasting Room In 2018 Leykis was producing a weekend show, The Tasting Room with Tom Leykis. It first aired mostly on such West Coast stations as KGIL in Los Angeles, California and KFBK in Sacramento, California. It was produced by The New Normal Network and later has morphed into a 2-hour podcast show. In the show he discussed: ‚Äúfine wine, high-end spirits, and craft brews [plus] first-rate dining and premium cigars‚Äù. The show was first broadcast mostly on West Coast radio markets but has later moved online. Personal life Leykis is divorced and has no children. He is an atheist, although reared as a Catholic. He has been married and divorced four times, which he unabashedly proclaims on-air regularly. His second marriage was to television reporter Christina Gonzalez. Leykis alleges that he discovered that she was cheating on him after he investigated some hotel receipts he found. Another marriage, which lasted one year, was with a Seattle woman in 1989, who was a listener of his show. His fourth wife, Susan Drew Leykis, who first met Leykis at a Los Angeles Kings game, filed a police report against him while they were married and living in Boston in 1993. On December 22 of that year, she alleged that Leykis assaulted and threatened to kill her during a fight after they returned home from a radio station Christmas party. He was subsequently charged with \\"felony assault and battery and threatening to commit a crime\\"; a police officer found bruises and scratches on the woman. In March 1994, Leykis was sentenced to a year of probation and ordered to attend a domestic violence class. He completed both, and the charges were dropped, although Leykis did not admit guilt as part of the agreement. The couple have since divorced. In August 2004, Leykis was attacked outside a Seattle bar and all-night diner, The 5 Point Cafe. In the assault, he was kicked in the face and knocked down to the ground, causing him to require 17 stitches over one eye, and leaving him with scratches and bruises on his knees. The assailant reportedly had an accomplice who accused Leykis of calling him a name and hanging up on him when he called the show. The suspects left by taxi prior to police arriving on the scene and were jailed. Leykis refused to prosecute due to the distance and he felt that having a few days in jail was enough. In late 2016, an obsessed fan was alleged to have called the show around 200 times a week and to have made threats against Leykis himself. A three-year restraining order was granted.

History Citrique Belge Evening Citrique Belge Factory In 1916, Alphonse Cappuyns and Ars√®ne Smeets, both students from Leuven, started searching for the biological production of citric acid. First they tried by letting random micro-organisms ferment sugar into citric acid. Later they proceeded by selecting the Aspergillus niger fungus after which they achieved a productivity which allowed for industrial exploitation. This led to the foundation of the Belgian-Italian company La Citrique Belge in 1929. In 1947, the basic substrate sugar was changed with the cheaper by-product molasses and the production and profitability increased steadily. In 1977, Citrique Belge was acquired by Hoffmann‚ÄìLa Roche and after the acquisition, the production capacity of citric acid was more than doubled. In 2003, DSM took over the vitamin division of Roche, including Citrique Belge. In 2010, Citrique Belge was acquired by Adcuram. See also * Sugar refinery of Tienen ReferencesSources * F.

Sawdonia is best recognized by the large number of spikes (enations) covering the plant. These are vascular plants that do not have vascular systems in their enations. The first species of this genus (Sawdonia ornata) was described in 1859 by Sir J. William Dawson and, was originally attributed to the genus Psilophyton. He named this plant Psilophyton princeps. In 1971 Francis Hueber proposed a new genus for this species due to its \\"Divergent technical characters from the generic description for Psilophyton.\\" The holotype used for description is Dawson Collection Number 48, pro parte, Museum Specimen Number 3243. (See Dawson 1871, Plate IX, fig 101.) Sir J. William Dawson Collection, Peter Redpath Museum, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  Morphology  These plants are described by Hueber as having monopodially branched stems, that are unridged, spinous and circinately tipped. The sporangia are described as round in abaxial view, and oval in lateral view. These sporangia are formed laterally and singular on short stalks. The sporangium split along convex margins into equal valves in a trilete fashion. The spines are tapered and pointed lower on the plant but form loose spikes at end of the plant. The sporangium split along convex margins into equal valves in a trilete fashion.The xylem are just one solid strand. The epidermal cells have cuticular papillae. There are stomata located on the on stem but not on spine surfaces. Sawdonia is defined by Francis Hueber in his 1971 paper as follows: # Having stems up to 5 mm in diameter without measuring the spikes # Multi cellular spines measuring 0.5-1.8 mm at the base, reaching 0.5-3.9mm long, with a density range of 4 to 45 per cm of stem # Sporangia: 3-3.5 mm in diameter, with stalks 0.5-0.75 mm long and 1-1.25 mm wide # A present Vascular strand # Spores: round to sub-triangular, 54-64 um, trilete simple structure # An oval xylem strand when viewed in cross section .074x0.34 mm in diameter # Trachieds that have a helical scalariform # Stomata 39-72 um long, 17-34 um wide, with parallel elongation in regards to the axis of the stem, with a thickened outer wall of guard cells  Taxonomy =Classification= There is agreement that Sawdonia was a zosterophyll ‚Äì a group of plants on the line of evolution leading to the modern lycopodiopsids. In their 1997 cladistic study, Kenrick and Crane placed Sawdonia in the family Sawdoniaceae, order Sawdoniales.Kenrick, Paul, and Peter R. Crane. The Origin and Early Diversification of Land Plants: a Cladistic Study. Smithsonian Inst. Press, 1997. An alternative view places the genus in the family Gosslingiaceae, order Gosslingiales. = Species = *Sawdonia ornata *Sawdonia acanthotheca *Sawdonia curtsipa (disputed)  Range  Sawdonia had an extremely broad range, with many specimens found in Canada, England and Scotland.

Philip Waller, ‚ÄòGarvice, Charles Andrew (1850‚Äì1920)‚Äô, first published Sept 2004, Index Number 101038692 - 1 March 1920) was a prolific British writer of over 150 romance novels, who also used the female pseudonym Caroline Hart. He was a popular author in the UK, the United States and translated around the world. He was ‚Äòthe most successful novelist in England‚Äô, according to Arnold Bennett in 1910. He published novels selling over seven million copies worldwide by 1914, and since 1913 he was selling 1.75 million books annually, a pace which he maintained at least until his death. Despite his enormous success, he was poorly received by literary critics, and is almost forgotten today.Laura Sewell Matter, \\"Pursuing The Great Bad Novelist\\", Georgia Review, Fall 2007 The Marquis (1895) Biography=Personal life= Charles Andrew Garvice was born on 24 August 1850 in or around Stepney, London, England, son of Mira Winter and Andrew John Garvice, a bricklayer. In 1872, he married Elizabeth Jones, and had two sons and six daughters.Charles Garvice, biography by Steve Holland at Bear Alley, 20 Feb 2010 Garvice suffered a cerebral hemorrhage on 21 February 1920 and was in a coma eight days until his death on 1 March 1920. Until recently not much has been known about Garvice's personal life. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography said \\"Little .. is known of his family origins and personal life. Obscurity envelops [him].\\" John Sutherland in the Companion to Victorian Literature said \\"Little is known of Garvice's life.\\"John Sutherland. Companion to Victorian Literature In 2010, English freelance author and editor Steve Holland did an exhaustive search of baptismal records, genealogy databases and census records to build a picture of his early life. Garvice is buried in Richmond Cemetery. W. Somerset Maugham, who met him at The Garrick, described Garvice as \\"a modest, unassuming, well-mannered man. I am convinced that when he sat down to turn out another of his innumerable books, he wrote as one inspired, with all his heart and soul.\\"Maugham, W. Somerset: A Writer's Notebook, page 315, Penguin Books, 1967 =Writing career= Garvice got his professional start as a journalist. His first novel, Maurice Durant (1875), was marginally successful in serialized form, but when published as a novel, it did not sell well. He concluded it was too long and too expensive for popular sales - this early experience taught him about the business side of writing. He would spend the next 23 years writing serialized stories for the periodicals of George Munro, who later bound and sold them as novels. Titles included A Modern Juliet, Woven in Fate's Loom, On Love's Altar, His Love So True, and A Relenting Fate. Just a Girl (1898) was very popular in the US, and its success brought him attention in the UK - from then on every novel he published became a best- seller in England. By 1913 Garvice was selling 1.75 million books annually, a pace which he maintained at least until his death. Garvice published over 150 novels, selling over seven million copies worldwide by 1914. Just a Girl was filmed in 1916. According to Garvice's agent Eveleigh Nash, Garvice's books were as \\"numerous in the shops and on the railway bookstalls as the leaves of Vallombrosa.\\" He was 'the most successful novelist in England', according to Arnold Bennett in 1910. In 1904, capitalizing on his wealth as a best-selling author, Garvice bought a farm estate in Devon, where he wanted to work the land in \\"the genuine, dirty, Devonshire fashion.\\" Like the characters in his novels, he romantically dreamed of a life happily ever after, lord of a country manor. He wrote about it in his one non-fiction book A Farm in Creamland. She Loved Him (1895) =Critical reception= Garvice's novels were formulaic predictable melodramas. They usually told the story of a virtuous woman overcoming obstacles and achieving a happy ending. He could crank out 12 or more novels a year, but \\"Little beyond the particulars of the heroines' hair color differentiates one from another,\\" says modern critic Laura Sewell Matter, who found his stories \\"boring\\". Likewise contemporary critics were almost unanimous in their disregard, but he was hard to ignore because of his best-selling status. As the London Times wrote in his obituary: :\\"It cannot be said that his work was of a high order; but criticism is disregarded by his own frank attitude towards the possibility of the permanence of his literary reputation. His answer to a captious friend who seemed solicitous to disabuse him on this score was merely to point with a gesture to the crowds on the seaside beach reading. \\"All my books,\\" he said: \\"they are all reading my latest.\\" It was a true estimate. In contemplating why his novels were so popular, Laura Sewell Matter said: :\\"[Garvice] endured more public ridicule [by critics] than any decent human being deserves. What [Thomas] Moult and other critics failed to acknowledge, but what Garvice knew and honored, are the ways so many of us live emotionally attenuated states, during times of peace as well as war. Stories like the one Garvice wrote may be low art, may not be art at all. They may offer consolation or distraction rather than provocation and insight. But many people find provocation enough in real life, and so they read for something else. One cannot have contempt for Garvice without also having some level of contempt for common humanity, for those readers - not all of whom can be dismissed as simpletons - who may not consciously believe in what they reading, but who read anyway because they know: a story can be a salve.\\" Bibliography Garvice was particularly popular in the United States, producing over 150 novels, twenty-five of which were written under the pseudonym Caroline Hart. =As Charles Garvice= *Maurice Durant.

Starting his career as CEO of J Walter Thompson UK & Ireland and COO of NTL UK & Ireland (now Virgin Media), in 2003 Carter became the founding CEO of Ofcom (Office of Communications) in the United Kingdom. He was subsequently the group CEO of Brunswick Group from 2007 until 2008, when he stepped down to join the administration of Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Initially serving in 2008 as Brown's chief of strategy, principal advisor, and the Downing Street Chief of Staff, he was the Minister for Communications, Technology and Broadcasting from 2008 to 2009. Between 2010 and 2013 he held various management positions at Alcatel-Lucent, and in 2013 he became the group CEO of Informa, an information and events company. Early life and education Born in Falkirk, Scotland on 12 February 1964, Stephen Carter grew up in Edinburgh, Scotland. His father worked for the logistics company Christian Salveson, and Carter would often travel to London with his family. He was educated at Currie High School in Edinburgh. In 1982 he began studying law at the University of Aberdeen, serving as student president in 1985 and 1986. He graduated in 1987 with a Bachelor of Laws, then attended Harvard Business School's six-week advanced management program in 1997. In 2010 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in law (LLD) by his alma mater, Aberdeen University. Career=JWT and NTL= Carter joined the firm J Walter Thompson (JWT) in 1986 as a graduate trainee, specializing in media and technology. In 1994 JWT named him managing director and CEO of J Walter Thompson Company UK & Ireland. He then became JWT's managing director in 1995 and chief executive in 1997. In 2000 Carter was appointed the chief operating officer and managing director of UK cable TV company NTL UK & Ireland (now Virgin Media). The company was deeply in debt, and Carter helped oversee complete restructuring of the UK & Ireland business. Given debts of ¬£12 billion and market conditions, the company was required to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, with Carter presiding over the bankruptcy proceedings. The company was poised to exit Chapter 11 when he left in 2003. His compensation payoff, rumored to be close to ¬£1.5 million with a ¬£600,000 bonus, met with criticism from shareholders, and in late 2007 the company resolved a class action lawsuit brought by shareholders by paying out $9 million in compensation. =Ofcom and Brunswick= On 1 March 2003 Carter became the founding CEO of Ofcom (Office of Communications), the British government's new media regulator. Among other issues, Carter focused on reducing broadband prices and switching from analog to digital television broadcasting. He also led negotiations with BT on matters such as local loop bundling. Stepping down from Ofcom in the summer of 2006, he was a part of the capability review team in 2006 and 2007 that reviewed the Department for International Development.

His official titles as of 2010 were executive vice president and chief strategy & marketing officer. Beyond serving as a managing director, he became the company's president of operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He returned to London and officially retired from Alcatel-Lucent in April 2013, although he continued to work on special projects for the company through that summer. =Informa= Carter was appointed a director of the board of Informa, an information services group, in 2010. In 2013, the Informa board unanimously voted to appoint him as CEO, succeeding Peter Rigby, in July 2013 \\\\- a role he assumed in early 2014. As CEO of the company he maintained the focus on investing in subscriptions, bookings and sponsorship, as well as expanding in international conferences such as the Monaco Yacht Show. Under Carter, in 2016 the company acquired the American events company Penton for ¬£1.2 billion. In January 2018, Informa announced the proposed acquisition of UBM, an events group, for ¬£3.9 billion. Carter, who became chief executive of the combined group, said at that point that he would retain the other parts of Informa, including business intelligence and its academic publishing business Taylor & Francis. Boards and committees Previously serving on the boards of companies such Travis Perkins, Royal Mail, and 2Wire, he was the chairman of Ashridge Business School from 2008 until 2015.

It also formed a part of the Goguryeo kingdom. The kingdom of Balhae was established in the area from 698 to 926 AD. The region then fell successively under the domination of the Khitan Liao Dynasty, the Jurchen Jin dynasty, and the Mongol Yuan Dynasty. During the Qing Dynasty, much of the area was under the control of the General of Jilin, whose area of control extended to the Sea of Japan to encompass much of what is Russia's Primorsky Krai today. Immigration of Han Chinese was strictly controlled. However, after the Primorsky Krai area was ceded to Russia in 1860, the Qing government began to open the area up to Han Chinese migrants, most of whom came from Shandong. By the beginning of the 20th century, Han Chinese had become the dominant ethnic group of the region. In 1932, the area was incorporated into Manchukuo, a puppet state set up by Japan, and Changchun (then called Hsinking), capital of Jilin today, was made the capital of Manchukuo. After the defeat of Japan in 1945, the region, together with the rest of northeastern China, was handed to the communists by the Soviet Union. Manchuria was then the staging ground from which the communists eventually conquered the rest of China (see Chinese Civil War#Post-war power struggle (1945‚Äì1947)). In 1949, Jilin province was smaller, encompassing only the environs of Changchun and Jilin City, and the capital was at Jilin City, while Changchun was a municipality independent from the province. In the 1950s Jilin was expanded to its present borders. During the Cultural Revolution, Jilin was expanded again to include a part of Inner Mongolia, giving it a border with the independent state of Mongolia, though this was later reversed. In recent times Jilin has, together with the rest of heavy industry-based Northeast China, been facing economic difficulties with privatization. This has prompted the central government to undertake a campaign called ‚ÄúRevitalize the Northeast‚Äù. Institutions The Jilin Provincial Museum was founded in Jilin City in 1951 and moved to Changchun with the transfer of the government's seat in 1954. In 2012, the museum was declared a national first-grade museum. The museum moved to its present location in Nanguan District in 2016.

The ship was purchased by the Australian Army on 16 July 1959 and was named Harry Chauvel (AV 1353) in honour of the Australian World War I general Harry Chauvel. The ship was one of four LSMs operated by the newly formed 32nd Small Ship Squadron, Royal Australian Engineers and was refitted in Japan before she arrived in Australia on 31 December 1959. From 1960 to 1964 Harry Chauvel supported Australian Army exercises and operated in a survey role on two occasions. In May 1964 she sailed for Malaysia and briefly took part in the Indonesian Confrontation in Borneo. During the late 60s the ship supported Australian Army exercises in Australian, New Guinea and New Zealand and made three voyages to South Vietnam to support the Australian units deployed there. Harry Chauvel was decommissioned on 30 September 1971 when the 32nd Small Ship Squadron was disbanded. She was sold to Pacific Logistics in September 1971 and was renamed Paclog Dispatch.

Originally a bandstand when the pier opened, it was converted into an enclosed pavilion in 1905.  History  The pier as it is known today was opened in 1901. To celebrate its official opening The Blue Viennese Band played in an open bandstand. In 1905 the bandstand was covered to form an enclosed pavilion and the following season the first ‚Äòconcert parties‚Äô were performed. Throughout the 20s and 30s the Cromer Protection Commission toured the South Coast looking at potential shows. In 1936 one of the theatres most famous shows appeared-Ronnie Brandons Out of the Blue. At the outbreak of World War II the Royal Engineers removed the middle section of the pier and shows ceased for the rest of the war. The devastating gales of 1953 damaged the pier and the pavilion. Compensation was granted by the Government for the repair of the pier and the theatre was ready for the start of the 1955 season. In 1978 changes were made to the theatre and at the same time a partnership with Irish Impresario Richard Condon. From this partnership the popular Seaside Special was created which won the National Piers Society Pier of the Year Award 2000. The pier was once again severely damaged in November 1993 by a break away rig barge.Eastern Daily Press feature Retrieved January 9, 2008 In 2001 a new partnership was formed between North Norfolk District Council and Openwide International to extend the season and increase economic growth for the pier and the town.

It espoused a mission of education and increased social rights and political access for underprivileged groups, focused especially on women, Shudras, and Dalits, in Maharashtra.. Jyotirao's wife Savitribai was the head of women's section of the society. The Samaj disbanded during the 1930s as leaders left to join the Indian National Congress party under Mahatma Gandhi. Early years and Ideology Jyotirao Phule was born into a Mali family in 1827 and was educated at a Christian missionary school. After he completed his own education, he and his wife focused on expanding educational opportunities for low caste communities. The Protestant Christian tilt of Phule's education strongly affected the theoretical underpinnings of the Satyashodhak Samaj. The Satyashodhak movement espoused a framework that could be called religious. It emphasized the equality inherent in all men, as bestowed upon them by a divine creator. It maintained faith in one god, rejected any kind of intermediary between god and man (referring here to the necessity of brahman priests in religious rituals), and rejected the caste system. The Samaj also developed arguments against brahman social and political superiority. Phule claimed that brahmans were Aryan invaders who came from Iran, invaded India, conquered and slaughtered the Kshatriya forefathers of the Shudras, enslaved the remaining population, and then used scripture, law, and custom to conceal their crimes. The Samaj argues that Brahman dominance is not an inherent trait; rather, the varnas were manufactured in a strategic move meant to establish and protect Brahman social standing. The artificial origins of the system gave low caste communities the right to contest it at the time. The Samaj insisted that, in order to reclaim their social standing, low caste groups should oppose priests as middleman between men and god in religious rituals and ceremonies. The Samaj also advocated for social changes that went against Brahminic traditions, including less expensive weddings, inter-caste marriages, the end of child marriage, and the right of the widow to remarry. The Samaj's original commitment to education and charitable activities was combined with the espousal of this anti-brahman rhetoric as the organization spread across Maharashtra. The organization attracted individuals of all castes, religions, and professions, including brahmans, Muslims, lawyers, merchants, peasants, land-owners, agricultural laborers, Rajputs, untouchables, and government officials. Phule thought that the Samaj could uplift disadvantaged communities through collective action and organized movement, and the first step to doing so was educating low caste individuals about the misdeeds of the Brahmans. In order to spread their ideas more effectively, the Samaj published the Deenabandhu newspaper from 1877 to 1897. In addition, the Samaj emphasized the special importance of English education because it played a vital role in building occupational skills and served as the basis for the intellectual emancipation of disadvantaged groups. Phule also believed that an English education might open opportunities for employment with the British Government. The Samaj's view of the colonial government went against nationalist groups at the time. They cultivated relations with British officials in order to seek benefits for low caste groups and saw the British government as the most likely power to offer low caste groups fair treatment. In fact, when Phule was criticized by Brahmans about his unwillingness to fight for national liberation, he responded that Shudras should expand their scope of freedom by directing their complaints to a benevolent, if misguided, British government.  Influence on the Peasant Revolts and the non-Brahman Movement  The Samaj's critiques of Brahmanical tradition in Maharashtra formed the basis for a peasant-based mass movement against the shetji-bhatji class of intelligentsia and the moneylender-landlord. In the early 20th century, the Samaj faced difficulty in connecting with the peasant areas of Maharashtra. Finding lectures ineffective, the Samaj turned to tamashas, popular folk dramas, to communicate their messages. Satyashodhak tamashas followed the traditional format but subverted the pro-Brahman elements of the dramas. They began with an invocation to Ganpati, a traditional brahman deity, but added an explanation that the actual meaning of the word came from gan (people) and pati (leader). The invocation to Ganpati was therefore an invocation to the people as a source of rule. The plays continued with a discussion of brahman tyranny, followed by a story about the efforts of brahmans to cheat peasants. These Satyashodhak tamashas were also used by non-brahman elites for political purposes, including as election propaganda. Through the tamashas, the Samaj was able to connect its activities and those of non-Brahman leaders with general peasant interests. The inculcation of Satyashodhak and non-Brahman ideology in the peasant masses led to rebellion in some parts of Maharashtra. In Satara in 1919, tenants revolted against their brahman landlords in coordination with the Samaj's anti-religious ideology. The Vijayi Maratha newspaper describes the event: ‚ÄúBrahman land rent had greatly soared‚Ä¶ no profit remained to the peasants ‚Äì then they decided they didn‚Äôt want such a low contract on Brahman lands. In this way, the Satyashodhak Samaj freed them from every type of Brahman slavery.‚Äù The process of rebellion in other cities in Maharashtra took a similar shape ‚Äì the Satyashodhak Samaj arrived with its ideology and its tamashas that mocked brahman superiority. Peasants stopped relying on brahmans for religious ceremonies, interrupted brahman ceremonies, violated temples, and broke idols. Poor, low caste peasants had accepted a social ideology which argued that their status was not legitimized in any religious texts and gave them the right to revolt against their brahman landlords in order to achieve a better lifestyle. These peasant revolts in Maharashtra showed that the Satyashodhak Samaj's ideology was salient to common people and capable of stimulating group action.  Critics of the Samaj  While the Samaj found great allies in low caste groups, brahmans found Phule‚Äôs efforts to be sacrilegious and anti-nationalist. They fought back against the idea of brahmans as opportunistic invaders and greedy elites. One particular critic, Vishnushashtri Chiplunkar, argued that brahmans had always respected lower-caste individuals. He claimed that brahmans respected the great saints and holy men who were born into the lowest castes and elevated to positions of respect by merit. He argued that the Samaj was simply trying to expose brahmans in an attempt to gain favor with the British colonial government and gain some small rights. To critics like Chiplunkar, the Samaj‚Äôs attempts to gain social and political rights for Shudras and women by lobbying the colonial government were seen as begging India‚Äôs oppressors to help them reject Hindu tradition. The upper-caste leaders of Maharashtra disliked the Samaj‚Äôs friendly relations with Christian missionaries and its appeals to the British Raj and so treated the organization with scorn. Brahmans also questioned the religious framework of the Satyashodhak Samaj, noting the Christian ties inherent in the Satyashodhak belief that all beings were granted universal rights at birth by a generous and loving creator. Brahmans argued that Phule was attempting to make a new religion, and that it seemed to lack any ethical or theological purpose. They asserted that the claims that Phule made lacked consistency. In response to his argument that brahmans were Aryan invaders who established and enforced a religion and social system to benefit them and keep them in power, they argued that Phule did not have the authority to rewrite history. For how could he go against the writings of the Ramayana and Bhagavad Gita, and who was he to declare the truth of the alternate history he had created? Chiplunkar declared that Phule was luring his worshippers into what would ultimately be a fruitless search after truth.  Revival under Shahu  Chhatrapati Shahu who revived Samaj activities in early 20th century The non-Brahmin movement, that was embodied in Satyashodhak Samaj, had not made much difference to any sections of the society in the 19th century and languished after the death of Phule. However, it was revived in the early 20th century by the Maratha ruler of the princely state of Kolhapur, Shahu Maharaj. In 1902, Shahu reserved 50 per cent civil service posts in Kolhapur state for all communities other than Brahmins, Prabhus and Parsi. He also sponsored religious ceremonies that did not need a Brahmin priest to officiate. By the 1920s, the samaj had established strong roots among the rural masses in Western Maharashtra and Vidarbha and took a strong economic overtone in its message. At that time the organization styled itself the representative of the Bahujan samaj. It also defined the Brahmins, merchants and moneylenders as the oppressors of the masses. The Samaj also conducted activities in Satara District, Kolhapur State and other places in this area that were designed to harass Brahmins, and to drive them from their positions as priests, government officials, money-lenders, and teachers in the rural areas. Prior to 1920s, the samaj opposed the Indian national movement because it was a movement led by the elites. Later followers of the Samaj during 20th century included educationalist Bhaurao Patil and Maratha leaders such as Keshavrao Jedhe, Nana Patil, Khanderao Bagal and Madhavrao Bagal. By the 1930s, given the mass movement nature of the Congress party under Mahatma Gandhi, the samaj leaders such as Jedhe joined the Congress, and the samaj activities withered away.  Legacy  The doctrine of the Samaj left a major impact on India's intellectual and political spheres, especially in relation to non-brahman and Dalit politics. The non-Brahman movement owed a great deal to the Satyashodhak doctrines of universal rights and equality and the Samaj's arguments against brahman domination of social, religious, and political life. The Dalit political movement, which was separate from the non-Brahman one (as the non-Brahman movement did not often emphasize the particular political and social difficulties associated with the Dalit experience), continued to be affected by Phule's teachings into the early twentieth century.

It was the site of many widely discussed criminal trials from 1797 until 2010, when the Criminal Courts of Justice building opened. Under British rule 1848 trial of John Mitchel The Dublin City Sessions House was completed in 1797, on part of the \\"Little Green\\", which had been owned by St. Mary's Abbey before the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and was later used as a graveyard. The previous sessions house was the Tholsel, beside the Church of St. Nicholas Within. The architect of the new Sessions House is believed to have been Whitmore Davis. The building held different courts, including the Dublin Commission Court (for the city and county, similar to the assizes held in other Irish counties), the city quarter sessions, and the courts of the Lord Mayor, the Sheriff, and the Recorder. The courthouse was part of a complex which also included three prisons ‚Äî Newgate (completed 1781), the Sheriff's Prison (completed 1794), and the City Marshalsea (completed 1804) ‚Äî and the Governor of Newgate's residence. The Newgate prison replaced the original county gaol of the county of the city of Dublin, which was located at the New Gate of the city wall. Which prison a convict or remanded defendant stayed in depended on the court and crime; besides those on Green Street there was Richmond Bridewell south of the Liffey, and Kilmainham Gaol west of the city took prisoners from the County Commission Court. (Kilmainham Courthouse held the county quarter sessions). Because the courthouse held Commission Courts for both County Dublin and the county of the city, it was legally treated as part of both counties. Green Street Courthouse was the venue of trials of noted Irish republican rebels, including Robert Emmet in 1803,Sullivan & Sullivan 1878 p.46 John Mitchel in 1848,Sullivan & Sullivan 1878 p.84 and Fenian leaders later.Sullivan & Sullivan 1878 pp.144,162,185 As well as holding trials, the Sessions House was the venue for election of members of the UK parliament for the Dublin City constituency. Independence After the 1922 creation of the Irish Free State, Green Street housed the Central Criminal Court established by the Courts of Justice Act 1924 to try murder and other serious crimes. Except during the Civil War (1922‚Äì23) and the Emergency (1939‚Äì45), all death sentences were handed down in Green Street. The Special Criminal Court (SCC), for terrorism and organised crime, was revived in 1972 in response to the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and thereafter sat in Green Street. People convicted there include republicans Martin McGuinness in 1973, Colm Murphy in 2001, and Michael McKevitt in 2009; anarchists Marie and Noel Murray in 1976; and gangster John Gilligan in 2001. The Courthouse was modified for the February 1976 trial of the kidnappers of Tiede Herrema. On 16 July 1976, three IRA bombs exploded at the Courthouse, breaching a sidedoor and allowing the escape of five on trial for bombmaking. Four were apprehended in the vicinity. The courthouse was one of only two in the state to have a dock for the accused. The last criminal trial at Green Street was on 11 December 2009, with the newly opened Criminal Courts of Justice building hosting trials from the start of 2010. The Green Street Courthouse building is still used by the Courts Service for juvenile custody summary hearings, and for administration, including the Drug Treatment Court Programme Office and the Reform and Development Office.

The Burying Beetle made the Branford Boase Award shortlist and The Bower Bird was Costa Children's Book of the Year. Several collections of her poetry and photographs were published before she wrote the novels that are the first two in a trilogy.  Biography  The Burying Beetle and The Bower Bird chronicle the story of Gussie, a 12-year-old girl who suffers from pulmonary atresia, a rare heart disease. Gussie is marked by her vivacity and thirst for knowledge, living every day to the full. The character is modelled on Ann's late son, Nathan Kelley, who suffered from the same congenital heart condition. When her son was born doctors said he would not survive the week and later said he would never walk. But Nathan defied predictions and lived to become an accomplished student. He had a passion for marine life and discovered two new fish cancers at the age of 16 (both registered with the U.S. Smithsonian Institution). Nathan went on to study biology and space sciences at Reading University and University College London. He died at age 24, a week after receiving a heart and lung transplant in December 1985. Ann began writing poetry years after Nathan's death and published The Poetry Remedy in 1999 and then Paper Whites in 2001. Ann's first novel, The Burying Beetle, was published in 2005 by Luath Press Ltd and Because We Have Reached That Place (poetry) was published by Oversteps Books in 2006. Her most recent work, The Bower Bird (also published by Luath) won the 2007 Costa Book Awards Children's Book of the Year. Ann has said about her books: 'Gussie just came to me. I don't write for children, I write for a reader. It's a glimpse into the head of a child with a chronic disease, who has to find a way to live her short life to the full... Gussie isn't my son. She is an amalgamation of several people ‚Äì my daughter, my grand daughter, my son and me ‚Äì and she is mostly herself. My son knew that even with a successful transplant, in those days he would only have had a few more years. But he was so happy to have been given that chance. I think that is why I write about Gussie ‚Äì to make people see the importance of being an organ donor. Please be an Organ Donor.' Ann has won several prizes for her poetry and has run courses for aspiring poets from her home. She also conducts special study units in poetry writing for medical students and speaks about her work with patients at medical conferences. She is an honorary teaching fellow at Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Exeter and Plymouth. Her collected photographic works are Born and Bred (1988) and Sea Front (2005). Ann Kelley also has a daughter, Caroline, and two grandchildren. She lives with her second husband in St Ives, Cornwall.

She was a daughter of Francesco II of Lesbos (a maternal grandson of Andronikos III Palaiologos) and Valentina Doria. Marriage At some point before August 1397, Irene married her paternal second cousin John VII Palaiologos, also a great-grandson of Andronikos III Palaiologos. William Miller dates the marriage as \\"just before\\" the departure of the Comte de Nevers that month, without citing a source. (Miller, \\"The Gattilusj of Lesbos (1355‚Äì1462)\\", Byzantinische Zeitschrift 22 (1913), p. 414) John VII had deposed his paternal grandfather, John V Palaiologos, in 1390. He ruled from 14 April to 17 April 1390 before John V was restored to the throne. John VII managed to keep the title of co-emperor and the domain of Selymbria due to intervention of Bayezid I. His grandfather died the following year, and was succeeded by Manuel II Palaiologos, a paternal uncle of John VII. The sequence of events possibly preceded the marriage of Irene to John VII. She is not mentioned involved in them. In time relations between Manuel II and John VII would improve. From 1399 to 1402, Manuel II embarked on a journey of Western Europe, seeking allies to use against Bayezid who was besieging Constantinople. During his absence, Manuel II entrusted John VII with the regency of the city; by this time Irene was already married to John. Bayezid lifted the siege in 1402 when Timur, founder of the Timurid dynasty, invaded Anatolia and the Ottoman Empire had to defend itself. John VII remained in control of Constantinople until the return of Manuel II, whereupon Irene's husband was expelled from the city in 1403, under suspicion of conspiring to regain the throne. Irene and John VII kept their imperial titles and established their own court at Thessaloniki. John VII died on 22 September 1408. Irene survived her husband and retired to Lemnos. She became a nun under the monastic name Eugenia. The chronicle of George Sphrantzes records the date of her death and her burial in the Church of Pantokrator.Chronicle 24:3; translated by Marios Philippides, The Fall of the Byzantine Empire: A Chronicle by George Sphrantzes, 1401-1477 (Amherst: University of Massachusetts, 1980), p. 52 Children The only known child of Irene and John VII was Andronikos V Palaiologos.

It is a woody shrub with pointed, linear leaves and in spring, heads of yellow flowers which turn red as they age. Description Verticordia subulata is a shrub which grows to a height of and a width of . There is usually a single branch at the base and no lignotuber. The leaves are linear in shape, pointed, long whilst those near the flowers are shorter. The flowers are lightly scented and are arranged in corymb-like groups on erect stalks from long. The floral cup is top-shaped, about long, ribbed, slightly wary and glabrous. The sepals are yellow, turning deep red with age, about long, with 8 to 10 densely hairy lobes. The petals are a similar colour to the sepals, about long and have long, pointed, finger- like projections. The style is long, straight and glabrous. Flowering time is from September to October. Taxonomy and naming Verticordia subulata was first formally described by Alex George in 1991 from specimens collected from the Stirling Range National Park by Alex and Elizabeth George. The description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (subulata) is derived from the Latin word subula meaning \\"an awl\\" referring to the shape of the staminodes. George placed this species in subgenus Chrysoma, section Chrysoma along with V. citrella, V. endlicheriana and V. acerosa. Distribution and habitat This verticordia occurs in the area between the Beaufort River, Kalgan, Lake King and the Stirling Range National Park, in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows in clay and sand, sometimes over laterite soils, on flats and rises in heath, shrubland and open woodland. Conservation Verticordia subulata is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This ornamental shrub can be propagated from cuttings, provided they are taken from late in spring. It is slow growing and needs to be in well-drained soil in a sunny position to avoid fungal attack.

In 1263 he was appointed successor to Hugues Libergier as director of the work of building the church of Saint- Nicaise in Reims, and between this date and 1279 he constructed the choir chapels, and part of the transept; the church was afterwards destroyed during the French Revolution. Some illustrations of this building, begun in 1229 and considered one of the best Gothic churches of the period in France, have been preserved; a nearly contemporary chronicle of the Abbey of Saint-Nicaise says that, \\"Hugo Libergiers pronaon ecclesi√¶ perfecit. Robert de Coucy caput ecclesi√¶ construxit\\". After the death of his father, Robert de Coucy had also chief charge of the work on the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Reims, which was rebuilt after its destruction by fire in 1211. The new cathedral was begun in 1211, and the choir, constructed by Robert de Coucy the elder, was completed in 1241; The cathedral was built on a simple plan of a vast choir, no transepts, and a rather narrow nave. Viollet-le-Duc says: > \\"This building has all the strength of the cathedral of Chartres without its > heaviness; in short it combines the essential requirements of artistic > beauty, power and grace; it is, besides, built of fine materials cunningly > put together, and there is found in all its parts a painstaking care and a > skill very rare at a period when men built with great rapidity and often > with inadequate resources\\". In a labyrinth, or representation of a maze, which formerly existed in the pavement of the nave of the cathedral were effigies of the architects of the edifice from its foundation up to 1382; among these effigies, according to tradition, were those of the two Robert de Coucys, father and son. In the cloister of the Abbey of Saint-Denis at Reims, Andre F√©libien noted the gravestone of Robert de Coucy, \\"Maistre de Notre-Daine et de Saint-Nicaise, qui tr√©passa en l'an 1311\\".

After taking the camera, striking members of the audience and the security team, and being pulled out of the audience by crew members, Rose grabbed his microphone and said \\"Well, thanks to the lame-ass security, I'm going home!\\", slammed his microphone on the stage and left. After Rose left, guitarist Slash quickly told the audience, \\"He just smashed the microphone.

Originally called Heytesbury Holdings, the company was formed by Robert Holmes √† Court in the 1970s as the holding company of his rapidly expanding financial empire. After the sale of its interests in Bell Group and Bell Resources in 1988, Heytesbury became an active private investment vehicle, acquiring Stoll Moss Theatres and Sherwin Pastoral Co, and investing in companies such as Jaguar Cars, Christie's, Standard Chartered Bank and U.S. Steel. Following the death of Robert Holmes √† Court in 1990, his widow Janet Holmes √† Court took over the management of Heytesbury. Over the next decade a number of assets were sold to reduce the company's large debt load, including the Stoll Moss Group, a number of cattle stations in Northern Australia, and the John Holland Group (which had been purchased after Robert's death). In 2000, the eldest son, Peter Holmes √† Court, elected to sell his one-sixth share of Heytesbury to pursue his own interests. Robert Holmes √† Court, died intestate (without a will), leaving his wife one third of the family fortune with the four children getting the other two thirds. The amount Peter received was reported as A$35 million. Shortly afterwards, in 2000, Paul Holmes √† Court, the youngest son of Robert and Janet Holmes √† Court took over the management of Heytesbury. In the same year, Peter Holmes √† Court was appointed to the position of chief executive officer of the Australian Agricultural Company (AACo) and was responsible for re-listing AACo on the Australian Stock Exchange. This set Peter up in direct competition with the family, since the primary business of both Heytesbury and AACo was cattle. In 2008, Paul bought out his other family shareholders and took sole ownership of the company. Heytesbury now owns a number of large cattle stations in Northern Australia (including Mount Sanford Station and the famous Victoria River Downs), Vasse Felix (Margaret River's first winery) and the thoroughbred stud Heytesbury Stud near Perth.

Crime is treated very leniently by the state, and conditions in prison are actually quite superior to those among the population at large, leading to an understandably high recidivism rate. Upon release, Plastic goes to work at a state-run euthanasia centre. The centres are not restricted to the terminally ill and are so popular that Plastic's sole responsibility is to stem \\"the too eager rush\\" of perfectly healthy but \\"welfare weary\\" citizens. Plastic soon falls in love with Clara, a bearded woman who is a \\"priority case\\" at the centre. However, she does not wish to die (she was sent there by her department) and the two begin a romance. One day, however, she suddenly disappears, and when he finds her, she has a rubber jaw replacing her formerly bearded face. Distraught, Plastic sets his former prison on fire, and, unidentified as the perpetrator of the crime, becomes elevated in status as the prison's only \\"successfully rehabilitated inmate.\\" Sent to become a lecturer on the worthiness of the prison system, Plastic is directed to marry an unattractive civil servant.

Its core business activities encompass construction, property development, manufacturing and quarrying, Infrastructure concessions and plantations. Headquartered in Selangor, Malaysia, IJM's regional aspirations have seen it establish a growing presence in neighbouring developing markets with operations presently spanning 10 countries, with primary focus in Malaysia, India, United Arab Emirates, China and Indonesia. Corporate Profile The result of a merger between three medium-sized local construction companies ‚Äì IGB Construction Sdn Bhd, Jurutama Sdn Bhd and Mudajaya Sdn Bhd, IJM was formed in 1983 to compete more effectively against bigger foreign rivals. The Company began to quickly establish itself as a professionally managed construction group and rapidly gained market acceptance. Over the years, the Company progressively built on its delivery capabilities, competitive prowess and financial capacity to strengthen its footing as a reputable local contractor. In April 2007, IJM acquired the Road Builder Group (\\"RBH\\"), its nearest competitor, to augment its position as one of the country's biggest builders. In addition to bolstering its construction order book, property land bank and infrastructure portfolio, the enlarged Group enabled IJM to attain considerable synergistic benefits, greater local prominence as well as attain a more sizeable balance sheet to bid for larger jobs and facilitate its expansion into overseas markets. IJM's undertaking as a property developer began as a natural progression from its experience in the construction business. The Group's property arm has since grown considerably. IJM Land Berhad is one of the largest property developers in Malaysia with sprawling townships, commercial buildings and high-rise condominiums under development in key growth areas throughout the country. Besides establishing itself as a reputable township developer in India, IJM has also successfully undertaken ventures overseas in the past such as in Orlando USA, Singapore and Australia. Initially supporting in-house needs, the Group's Industry Division quickly grew its operations into scale-able core activities focused on catering to demand from outside the Group. IJM continued to expand on its operations in this division with strategic acquisitions such as the takeover of Industrial Concrete Products Berhad in 2004 and successful market diversifications into China, India and Pakistan. Leveraging on its construction expertise, the Group also owns and operates infrastructure concessions to create long-term recurrent income streams. Initial advancements into concession assets in Malaysia, however, proved elusive and, thus, an international focus was adopted. IJM's involvement in overseas infrastructure privatisation (Build-Operate-Transfer) schemes met with considerable success. Amongst the Group's present investments in major overseas infrastructure projects are the Western Access Tollway in Argentina, five tolled highways and the Gautami power plant in India, and the Binh An water treatment concession in Vietnam. In Malaysia, the Group owns and operates three highways and port concessions from the RBH merger. The Group had previously invested in and profitably sold several infrastructure assets in China. The Group also ventured into oil palm plantations in 1985 as a source of steady income to cushion the cyclical nature of its core construction business. This investment has since paid off handsomely. Now listed on the Main Market of Bursa Securities, IJM Plantations Berhad has contributed significantly to the Group's earnings over the years and has also accorded the Group better resilience to weather macro-economic and input costs volatilities. It is currently expanding its plantation operations into Indonesia. When IJM went public in 1986, it had a market capitalisation of RM66 million and total assets of RM172 million. The Group's market capitalisation stood at RM9.83 billion as of 30 June 2014 and total assets stood at RM18.4 billion as of 31 March 2014. Company history I ‚Üí IGB Construction Sdn Bhd was incorporated in 1981 J ‚Üí Jurutama Sdn Bhd was incorporated in 1970 as Soon Tat Construction Sdn Bhd M ‚Üí Mudajaya Construction Sdn Bhd was incorporated in 1965 as Chye Hin Construction Co Ltd. In 1997, the name was changed to Mudajaya Corporation Berhad (a construction company of Mudajaya Group Berhad) The founders of Jurutama and Mudajaya were professionals serving as senior government officials. Despite holding secure positions, their determination to search for that legendary 'pot of gold at the end of the rainbow' led them to break new grounds at a time when hardly any qualified engineer dared venture out as contractor. With them at the helm, they steered Jurutama and Mudajaya through the high risk contracting business. With their perseverance and diligence to give their best, they brought new changes and professionalism to the entire Malaysian construction industry. And, by the end of the '70s, Jurutama and Mudajaya have emerged as two of the largest companies in Malaysia. Tough times set in at the turn of the decade when the influx of large and well-capitalised foreign contractors, who had with them surplus capacity and concessionary government loans, severely affected the competitiveness of local construction companies. Local contractors were slowly being relegated to being subcontractors or minority joint venture partners. Jurutama and Mudajaya were not spared. Their founders saw the obvious. Local companies have got to either merge, go public or come under the umbrella of larger public companies if they are to survive the challenges posed by these foreign contractors. A meeting of former Technical College mates brought the answer. IGB Corporation Bhd, a public listed property company which then owned a small building construction subsidiary, saw the synergies that a combination of IGB Construction, Jurutama and Mudajaya could bring to the Group. In 1982, in a friendly takeover, IGB Corporation Bhd acquired all the shares in Jurutama and Mudajaya. Following this acquisition, Solidstate Sdn Bhd was incorporated (1983) and, in 1984, the name was changed to IJM Engineering and Construction Sdn Bhd. IGB then transferred all its equity interests in Jurutama and Mudajaya together with that of IGB Construction in exchange for shares in this newly incorporated company. IJM had thus become IGB's holding company for its construction interests. In 1986, IJM turned public. An application made for its shares to be listed on the Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad was subsequently obtained in September 1986. To better reflect the Group's diversified nature of activities, the present logo and a new name, IJM Corporation Berhad, was adopted in 1989.

Biography  L'Enfant was born in Anet on August 26, 1704. After studying under Charles Parrocel, he was admitted as an ad√©micien to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in 1745. His specialties were battle scenes and landscapes; his most famous of his paintings were those depicting the War of the Austrian Succession: especially a series of panoramas tracing the war in the Low Countries between 1744 and 1748. The Palace of Versailles has four of his paintings, Prise de Menin, Si√®ge de Fribourg, Si√®ge de Tournai, and Si√®ge de Mons. He married Marie Charlotte Luillier. Together, they had Pierre Joseph (1752‚Äì1758), firstborn, died aged six, and Pierre Charles (1754‚Äì1825), designer of Washington, D.C. (capital city of the United States).

He was the third son of Francesco I Gattilusio and Maria Palaiologina, the sister of the Byzantine emperor John V Palaiologos.  Life  On 6 August 1384, an earthquake struck Lesbos. Amongst the dead were Francesco I Gattiluso and his two eldest sons, Andronico and Domenico. However the third son Jacopo survived: at the time the earthquake struck, he was sleeping by the side of his brothers in a tower of their castle, but the next day he was discovered in a vineyard at the base of the castle. He succeeded in the rule of Lesbos under the name Francesco II. Francesco II was still underage and was placed under the regency of his paternal uncle Niccol√≤ of Ainos. William Miller, \\"The Gattilusj of Lesbos (1355‚Äì1462)\\", Byzantinische Zeitschrift 22 (1913), p. 411f The regency lasted three years when an argument between the two ended it and Niccol√≤ returned to his own demesne.Miller, \\"The Gattilusj\\", p. 412 On the recommendation of their mutual friend, Demetrius Cydones, Francesco allowed Manuel Palaiologos to shelter on Lesbos for at least two months in the summer of 1387, after Manuel had fled Thessalonica. However Francesco did not allow Manuel to take up residence inside the walls of Mytilene, possibly due to the size of his entourage or because Francesco did not want to anger the Ottoman Sultan Murad I.Dennis, The Letters of Manuel II Palaeologus (Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks, 1977), p. 204 n. 1 In November 1388, Francesco joined in an alliance with the Knights of Rhodes, the Genoese of Chios, Jacques I of Cyprus, and the Genoese of Galata against Sultan Murad. In the summer of 1396 when Pera was besieged by the soldiers of Bajazet I, his galley happened to be stationed in the Golden Horn; the Genoese community of Pera petitioned Francesco for his help; he subsequently assisted the Venetians making a sortie to relieve Constantinople. Francisco, along with his uncle Niccol√≤, also pledged considerable sums in ransoming prisoners taken at the Battle of Nicopolis (1396); of the total ransom, fixed at 200,000 ducats, the two men made themselves liable for 150,000‚Äîwhich the prisoners promised to repay as soon as they could.Miller, \\"The Gattilusj\\", p. 413 This act, as well as the location of Lesbos, resulted in his home being frequently visited by traveling important personages from Western Europe: \\"this was their last stopping-place in Latin lands on their way to Constantinople or to Asia,\\" William Miller writes. Ruy Gonz√°les de Clavijo, the ambassador Henry III of Castile sent to Tamerlane in 1403, stayed with Francesco at one point in his outward journey, and records he met John VII Palaiologos, \\"the young Emperor\\" in his household; de Clavijo notes that John \\"resided a good deal in this island\\".Narrative of the Embassy of Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo, translated by Clements R. Markham (London: Hakluyt Society, 1859), pp. 23ff The name of Francesco's wife is not known. A clue to her identity is the statement of Konstantin the Philosopher, biographer of Stefan Lazareviƒá, who wrote around 1431 that Stefan's wife (a daughter of Francesco II) was \\"through her mother a niece of the emperor Manuel, from whom the lords and lineage of her family were named Palaiologi.\\" Which niece of the Emperor Manuel this was, or if her existence is otherwise recorded, remains a mystery.Anthony Luttrell, \\"John V's Daughters: A Palaiologan Puzzle\\", Dumbarton Oaks Papers, 40 (1986), p. 104 Francesco reportedly died in an unusual manner. He was bitten by a scorpion. The number of people rushing to his aid resulted in the wooden floor of his room collapsing under their combined weight. The poison did not kill him but the fall did.Miller, \\"The Gattilusj\\", p. 417  Family  Francesco had six known children: *Jacopo Gattilusio.

The screenplay was written by Valerie Curtin, Barry Levinson, and Robert Klane based on Preston Sturges' screenplay for the 1948 film of the same name. The original music score is by Bill Conti and the song \\"Unfaithfully Yours (One Love)\\" was written for the film and performed by Stephen Bishop. Plot Claude Eastman (Dudley Moore) is a composer and the conductor of a prestigious symphony who has recently married beautiful Daniella (Nastassja Kinski), a much younger woman. While travelling, he sends a message to his friend Norman Robbins (Albert Brooks) to keep an eye on his wife, but the message is garbled by Claude's Italian valet Giuseppe (Richard Libertini), and instead of looking after Daniella, Norman hires a private detective named Keller (Richard B. Shull) to investigate her. The private eye's report, which comes with a fuzzy video, is that Daniella had an assignation with a man who, by wearing Argyle socks, appears to be Maxmillian Stein (Armand Assante), a handsome violinist with the orchestra - and Claude's prot√©g√© - who is well known as a ladies man. Claude at first doesn't directly confront Max. When Max eventually meets Daniella, it is at a restaurant where Claude, overwhelmed with jealousy, duels Max with violins by playing a Cs√°rd√°s, the famous composition of Vittorio Monti. Claude confronts Daniella, who feels guilty because she is keeping a secret from her husband, only not the one he thinks it is. When she tells him that it's no big deal, Claude is enraged. As he conducts Tchaikovsky's \\"Violin Concerto\\", an elaborate plan to kill Daniella and frame Max for the murder runs through his mind, but afterwards, when he tries to carry out his plan, unforeseen circumstances intervene.rcs0411 Plot summary (IMDB)Betzold, Michael Plot synopsis (Allmovie)Canby, Vincent \\"Film: Unfaithfully Yours\\" New York Times (10 February 1984) Cast * Dudley Moore as Claude Eastman * Nastassja Kinski as Daniella Eastman * Armand Assante as Maxmillian Stein * Albert Brooks as Norman Robbins * Cassie Yates as Carla Robbins * Richard Libertini as Giuseppe * Richard B.

He is known as \\"Jean Cousin the Elder\\" to distinguish him from his son Jean Cousin the Younger, also an artist. Career Cousin was born at Soucy, near Sens, and began his career in his native town with the study of glass-painting under Jean Hympe and Grassot. At the same time, he studied mathematics and published a successful book on the subject. He also wrote on geometry in his student days. In 1530 Cousin finished the windows for Sens Cathedral, the subject chosen being the \\"Legend of St. Eutropius\\". He also painted the windows of many of the noble ch√¢teaux in and around the city. The latest date on any of his Sens work, 1530, points to this as the year he went to Paris, where he began work as a goldsmith; but the amount and kind of his productions in the precious metals are alike unknown. In Paris Cousin continued his career as a glass-painter, and created his best-known work, the windows of the Sainte-Chapelle in Vincennes. He subsequently devoted himself to painting in oil, and has been claimed as the first Frenchman to use that new medium. Pictures attributed to him, all of much merit, are found in several of the large European collections, but, excepting \\"The Last Judgment\\", none is known to be authentic. For a long time this work lay neglected in the sacristy of the church of the Minims, Vincennes, until it was rescued by a priest and transferred to the Louvre. It is said to be the first French picture to be engraved. He was also an illustrator of books, making many designs for woodcuts and often executed them himself. The \\"Bible\\", published in 1596 by Le Clerc, and the Metamorphoses and Epistles of Ovid (1566 and 1571 respectively) contain his most noted work as an illustrator. Cousin etched and engraved many plates after the manner of Parmigianino, to whom the invention of etching has been ascribed. He also created sculptures, including, it is thought, the mausoleum of Admiral Philippe de Chabot. In addition to his early writings on mathematics, he published, in 1560, a treatise on perspective, and, in 1571, a work on portrait-painting. During his life Cousin enjoyed the favour of and worked for four kings of France: Henry II, Francis II, Charles IX, and Henry III. Among his paintings, mention should also be made of the miniatures in the prayer book of Henry II now in the Biblioth√®que Nationale; among his etchings and engravings, the Annunciation and the Conversion of St. Paul; among his woodcuts, the Entr√©e de Henry II et Catherine de M√©dicis √† Rouen (1551; book available here). He died at Sens, but the date of his death is uncertain.

The group is composed of deceased fictional characters in zombie form that seek to eliminate all life from the DC Universe. Publication history Prior to the Blackest Night event, Black Hand (\\"leader\\" and first member of the Black Lantern Corps) had already been established as a villain within the pages of Green Lantern. Writer Geoff Johns revisited his origin and expanded upon certain aspects of it during the Green Lantern: Secret Origin story arc (2008).Green Lantern (vol. 4) issues #29-35 (May - November 2008) During the arc, Hand's energy-absorbing weapon (previously thought to be an original invention) is revealed to have been constructed by Atrocitus, enemy of the Guardians of the Universe and future founder of the Red Lantern Corps.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #32 (August 2008) Atrocitus comes to Earth and approaches Hand, recognizing him as a \\"doorway to the black\\" that possesses the power to bring about the Blackest Night. Hand manages to escape and pockets the weapon as he flees.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #33 (September 2008)Green Lantern (vol. 4) #34 (October 2008) The possession of this weapon soon leads him to become an enemy of the Green Lantern Corps, as he now feels a need to extinguish the light of the emotional spectrum.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #43 (September 2009) While being transported to prison, Black Hand experiences a sudden power surge that kills his captors. Xander roams the desert, hearing a voice instructing him to reclaim the souls of characters who were reanimated.DC Universe #0 (June 2008) Hand murders his family and commits suicide. The Guardian Scar arrives, and creates the first black power ring, which reanimates Black Hand. She reveals that Hand is the physical embodiment of death, and serves as the avatar of the Black Lantern Corps in the same manner that Ion, Parallax, and the Predator are for willpower, fear, and love respectively. Hand later digs up Bruce Wayne's corpse, removes his skull, and recites the Black Lantern oath for the first time. Soon after, black power rings descend upon the universe and begin reviving the deceased as Black Lanterns that attack both the heroes and the villains of the DC Universe. It is claimed the Power Battery is in Space Sector 666.Blackest Night #0 (June 2009) Black Hand is seen holding Wayne's skull in all future appearances, embracing it in a necrophiliac manner in Blackest Night #1 as the black power rings appear from the Black Power Battery, exclaiming that Wayne's death \\"plays a far greater role in the Blackest Night\\" than anyone thinks. At the end of the issue, it is shown that Black Hand uses the skull to produce new power rings at will, creating two rings for the newly deceased Carter Hall and Kendra Saunders. In Blackest Night #3, Indigo-1 describes the premise behind the Black Lantern Corps' fictional relationship with the universe. She explains that the darkness in existence before the creation of the universe is what powers the Black Lanterns. Banished at the dawn of time by the white light of creation, its fighting back causes the white light to be fractured into the emotional spectrum. The events transpiring throughout the titles of Blackest Night are a result of the darkness, once again, fighting back against creation. She goes on to describe how a combination of all seven lights can restore the white light of creation and bring an end to the Black Lanterns. Throughout the Blackest Night event, each time a Black Lantern successfully removes the heart of one of their victims, a black, lantern-shaped speech balloon (used within Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps to indicate that a power ring is speaking) depicts an ever-rising power level increasing in increments of 0.1 percent. In Blackest Night #4, the power meter is filled and Scar is able to transport the Black Central Power Battery to Coast City, and the true mastermind behind the Black Lanterns is able to step into the main DC Universe: Nekron. After being introduced into a primary role within the Blackest Night event, Indigo-1 recruits Hal Jordan to gather a team capable of recreating the white light of creation (chosen for having a personal connection to the most powerful members of the five remaining Corps).Blackest Night #3 (November 2009) The story unfolding in Green Lantern depicts Jordan and Indigo-1 recruiting Carol Ferris, Sinestro, Saint Walker, Atrocitus, and Larfleeze to their purpose.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #46-48 (November 2009-January 2010) In Blackest Night #5, the team assaults the Black Central Power Battery with the opposite results intended. Nekron is strengthened and able to recruit living characters reanimated from death to his Black Lantern Corps. Although the seven Corps representatives attempt to summon aid by recruiting temporary deputies until the rest of their Corps arrive - Ganthet joins the Green Lantern Corps, the Scarecrow joins the Sinestro Corps, Barry Allen joins the Blue Lanterns, the Atom joins the Indigo Tribe, Mera joins the Red Lanterns, Lex Luthor is inducted into the Orange Lanterns, and Wonder Woman is saved from her Black Lantern identity to join the Star Sapphires - they are nearly thwarted when Nekron digs up the Entity, the first life in the universe, and attempts to kill it. After Sinestro attempts and fails to merge with the entity similar to Hal's bond with Parallax - Sinestro powering the entity with his ego rather than his will to survive - Hal takes control of the Entity himself, noting that the heroes still chose to return to life even if Nekron gave them the opportunity. With this behind him, Hal merges with the entity and frees the reanimated heroes from Nekron's hold, creating the White Lantern Corps in the process, and subsequently reanimates Black Hand and the Anti-Monitor to deprive Nekron of his tether in the living world and his power source respectively. The White Lanterns used the power of the White Light to finally vanquish Nekron and the threat of the Blackest Night passed with the Black Lanterns disintegrating along with their power rings.Blackest Night #8 (March 2010) =The rebirth of the Black Lantern Corps= Though seemingly destroyed, an aspect of the Black Lanterns returned within Firestorm when his dark undead persona emerged - claiming the name Deathstorm.Brightest Day #10 (September 2010) Torturing the two hosts of the Firestorm Matrix, Deathstorm later traveled to the White Lantern Power Battery where he corrupted it. Whilst initially he intended to destroy it in order to kill all life in the universe, a voice came and commanded him not to do so. Instead, it ordered Deathstorm to bring it an army in order for it to command the power over life itself. With those words said, the White Lantern Power Battery in conjunction with Deathstorm created undead Black Lanterns of the 12 reanimated heroes and villains who had been reborn at the end of the Blackest Night.Brightest Day #11 (October 2010) After Deathstorm steals the White Lantern, he, along with Firestorm, are transported to Qward in the Anti-Matter Universe by the Anti- Monitor, revealed to be behind the returns of the 12 Black Lanterns. However, they are all destroyed when Ronnie and Jason teamed up, thus allowing Ronnie's labor to be accomplished and for him to be returned to life by the White Entity.Brightest Day #22 (March 2011) =The New 52= Following Black Hand's suicide to escape being inducted into the Indigo Tribe once again, a Black Power Ring emerges from his corpse, reviving him as a Black Lantern once again, although this did not restart the Blackest Night, possibly because Nekron was imprisoned in the Dead Zone at the time. Black Hand returns to Earth and reanimates his family and various dead in the graveyard around his house, but Hal Jordan and Sinestro were able to defeat these \\"zombies\\" by detonating Sinestro's old yellow power battery. They are unaware that the Book of the Black has stated that Hal Jordan will be the greatest \\"Black Lantern\\" in the beyond.Green Lantern (vol. 5) #12 (August 2012) When trapped in the Dead Zone (a realm between life and death) and deprived of his ring, Hal contemplates suicide as it was the only mean to harnessing the power of the remaining Black Lantern ring and using it to escape the Dead Zone and stop the First Lantern.Green Lantern (vol. 5) #18 (March 2013) After seeing the inhabitants of Korugar enter the Dead Zone, Hal finally makes the ultimate sacrifice and jumps off the Cliff.Green Lantern (vol. 5) #19 (April 2013) Hal claimed Black Hand's power ring and rises as a Black Lantern, which in turn reduced Black Hand's body to dust. With the help of the Indigo Tribe, Hal escapes from the Dead Zone and uses an army of Black Lanterns against Volthoom, but the undead legion is easily destroyed. Hal then proceeds to summon Nekron, who finally kills Volthoom. Hal then sends Nekron back to his tomb in the Dead Zone as his green ring returns to him, restoring him to life and membership in the Green Lantern Corps.Green Lantern (vol. 5) #20 (May 2013) During the war between the New Gods and the various Lantern Corps, Black Hand reanimated the various Source Titans (including Relic) that were impeded within the Source Wall as Black Lanterns. However, after Highfather's misuse of the Life Equation, they are fully resurrected.Green Lantern Annual (vol. 5) #3 (December 2014) Prominent members At San Diego Comic Con 2009, Geoff Johns was able to discuss his reasoning behind choosing Black Hand as the leader of the new Corps, the character properties of the Black Lanterns, and his own goals in writing their depictions. Commenting on the characters being chosen to reanimate during Blackest Night, Johns said: During the creation of Blackest Night, Johns (not being interested in, or frightened by, zombies) wanted to bring back the deceased characters in a way that seemed horrifying and emotionally disturbing to the living characters they encountered. To accomplish that effect, the Black Lanterns have personalities and actively seek out those who will be most affected by their appearance.Johns, Geoff. DC Comics: Green Lantern: Blackest Night (29:30) . San Diego Comic Con 2009. San Diego Convention Center, San Diego CA. 25 July 2009. Retrieved 2 August 2009. A prime example of Johns' use of personality distortion with the Black Lanterns is the Elongated Man (typically depicted as being a \\"light\\" character that uses his detective skill to \\"smell\\" when something is not right) looking upon his victims and remarking to his undead wife: \\"I smell a mystery.\\"Blackest Night #1 (September 2009) Johns identifies the power of the Black Lanterns as not necessarily being evil, but not being good either.Johns, Geoff. DC Comics: Green Lantern: Blackest Night (31:34) . San Diego Comic Con 2009. San Diego Convention Center, San Diego CA. 25 July 2009. Retrieved 2 August 2009. During his initial creation of the new Corps, Johns drew from information he had collected on light while taking physics classes. With the Corps of the emotional spectrum personifying life, he knew that this Corps would need to represent death. Black being an absence of light, he chose Black Hand as the leader of the Corps both for the character's name and also because of how much he enjoyed revamping villains while writing for Flash. Like the other members of the Black Lantern Corps, Johns wanted to take a different approach in his portrayal of Black Hand. Whereas other villains may have a particular motivation, Hand is meant to be depicted as a character who is clearly insane and whose presence makes others uncomfortable.Johns, Geoff. DC Comics: Green Lantern: Blackest Night (42:31) . San Diego Comic Con 2009. San Diego Convention Center, San Diego CA. 25 July 2009. Retrieved 2 August 2009. In Blackest Night #2, multiple black power rings attempt to reanimate the body of the Dove (Don Hall), only to be prevented from disturbing his grave by an invisible barrier. As they collide with the barrier, the rings' typical command (\\"Rise\\") is interrupted; the rings instead respond: \\"Don Hall of Earth at peace.\\" This is the first depiction of the black power rings failing to recruit a member for the Black Lantern Corps.Blackest Night #2 (October 2009) In an interview with IGN, Johns provides an explanation behind the Dove's immunity to the black power rings: \\"You'll learn more about this as we go forward. But really it speaks to the nature of Don Hall. He can't be desecrated by the likes of these things. He's untouchable in death and at total peace more than any other being in the universe.\\" Reflecting on the limitations of the rings, Johns goes on to state that, even though magic is a \\"joke\\" to the black power rings (though the undead Giovanni \\"John\\" Zatara is capable of wielding black magic), Don is quite the opposite.Geoff Johns: Inside Blackest Night - Part Two, IGN, August 14, 2009 Similarly, Blackest Night: Titans #1 shows Black Lantern Hank Hall unable to read Dawn Granger's emotions; her aura depicted as being white rather than a color from the emotional spectrum. In Blackest Night: Batman #1, the spirit of Deadman is unable to prevent a black power ring from reviving his remains. Deadman attempts to possess his own corpse, but is unable to control it.Blackest Night: Batman #1 (October 2009) During the Blackest Night panel at San Diego Comic Con 2009, Geoff Johns was asked whether the revived corpses of the Black Lanterns were speaking for themselves or if they were being controlled by an outside force. Johns declined to answer, implying that the question would be answered during the Blackest Night storyline.Johns, Geoff. DC Comics: Green Lantern: Blackest Night (38:55) . San Diego Comic Con 2009. San Diego Convention Center, San Diego CA. 25 July 2009. Retrieved 2 August 2009. Similarly, while being overcome by a black power ring, the Spectre declares that he \\"will not be used.\\" Prior to the Spectre's conversion, Black Hand makes note of the Shadowpact members Zatanna and Blue Devil being surrounded by an aura of life. Upon scanning the Phantom Stranger, Black Hand remarks that the Stranger is \\"neither living nor dead\\", and notes him as a person of interest to his Corps.

During the climax of Blackest Night #8, Boston Brand tells the Corps' leaders that Black Hand is the \\"tether keeping Nekron within our world\\", and that as the avatar of Death he is also the only key to defeating the Black Lanterns permanently. Using the White Lantern power of Life, Hal Jordan commands \\"William Hand of Earth - Live\\", resurrecting Black Hand and removing him as the Black Lantern Corps' primary power source - which deals a crippling and eventually fatal blow to the Black Lanterns. The Book of the Black Hidden within the vaults of Oa is a massive black tome known as The Ultimate Facilitator of the Blackest Night. Written in corrupted blood by the traitorous Guardian of the Universe, Scar, the book contains prophecies. The prophecies indicate which Earth heroes have the abilities to weather the Blackest Night and ensure the survival or destruction of the universe. Also within its pages is all the forbidden history of the Guardians of the Universe, and in an effort to protect its secrets, the rogue Guardian was forced to imprison the Sinestro Corps talekeeper Lyssa Drak inside the book. After Scar's true death and the end of the Blackest Night, The Book of the Black is found by Ganthet, who notes it retains much forbidden knowledge within its pages. He decides to keep it a secret from the other Guardians and entrusts Guy Gardner with the secret.Green Lantern - Emerald Warriors #1 The book is later taken by Krona who, after releasing Lyssa Drak from inside the book,Untold Tales of Blackest Night (October 2010) takes it to the Dead Planet of Ryut. There, after detecting the \\"New Guardians\\", it opens its pages to unveil the history of Krona.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #63 They are soon afterwards attacked by the book's keeper, the former Sinestro Corps member Lyssa Drak. She is capable of trapping Sinestro himself, Carol Ferris, Indigo-1, Atrocitus, Saint Walker and Larfleeze inside the book. However, Sinestro is able to prevent her from capturing Hal Jordan as well, by causing a detonation using the combined energy of their rings. The energy explosion also affects The Book of the Black, which disappears in a rainbow light, leaving only behind the rings of the six trapped Lanterns. The book is later seen on Oa while it forces the captured Lanterns to relive their lives prior to acquiring their current rings. After the defeat of Krona and the release of the New Guardians, the Book is taken by Lyssa Drak. She is later confronted by the now Green Lantern Sinestro who tracked her with the aid of an energy-manipulating alien hero he fought while in the Sinestro Corps. Contact with the Book of the Black reveals the Guardians' plan to replace the Corps with the 'Third Army'.Green Lantern (vol. 5) #6 (February 2012) Subsequently, the book returns to Black Hand's possession as it is sought by the Guardians of the Universe. The book reveals to Black Hand that Hal Jordan is not his enemy. When questioned about that, it reveals that Jordan will be the greatest Black Lantern. After Black Hand is imprisoned in the Chamber of Shadows,Green Lantern Annual #1 (August 2012) the Book of Black is retrieved by Green Lantern B'dg.Green Lantern (vol. 5) #16 (January 2013) However, the book sucks B'dg and Simon Baz into it and returns to Black Hand.Green Lantern Corps Annual #1 (January 2013) The book's prophecy is revealed to be true when Hal Jordan transforms into a Black Lantern as a means to escape the Dead Zone. Hal then summons Nekron in order to defeat the First Lantern, Volthoom. After his defeat, Hal is released from being a Black Lantern and returns to life as Green Lantern once again. Powers and abilities William Hand's black power ring The Black Lanterns are corpses reanimated by black power rings, which are fueled by the power of death. Corpses reanimated by black power rings are reconstructed if damaged, keeping the body in working order at all times.Montgomery, Lauren (Director). Johns, Geoff (Commentator) (2009). Green Lantern: First Flight (Behind the Scenes of Blackest Night). [animated film/DVD]. Warner Home Video. Warner Bros Animation. DC Comics. Black power rings are capable of regenerating typically fatal injuries inflicted upon their users (including the complete dissolution).Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #41 (December 2009) The rings generate black tendrils to \\"root\\" themselves into the corpses, making it impossible to remove them by physical force. The first black power rings possess no charge, but each time a Black Lantern kills someone and removes their heart, .01 percent power is restored to every ring in the Corps.SDCC 09: Blackest Night Consumes Comic-Con, IGN, July 25, 2009 In Blackest Night #3, Indigo-1 solidifies this theme by explaining that those who rise feed off emotion. Even at low power levels, black rings enable their user to fly and create black energy constructs. They are also unaffected by magic. In \\"classic\\" zombie fashion, the bite of a Black Lantern induces a slow-acting necrosis that eventually turns the victim into a fellow Black Lantern. It is unknown if this power can work on any living being, or only those characters who have been reanimated from death before (such as Superman, the Green Arrow, and Donna Troy).Blackest Night: Titans #3 (December 2009) Superman displaying a wide spectrum of emotions (will, fear, rage, hope, and love).Blackest Night: Superman #1 (October 2009) Nekron uses the Anti-Monitor as a physical power source within the Black Power Battery. It is alluded to in several comics and \\"Origins and Omens\\" backstories that it is the Anti-Monitor's desire for the end of humanity that made him the primary candidate to become the Battery's power supply following his betrayal and subsequent murder at the hands of Superboy-Prime during the Sinestro Corps War. In a climactic battle with all the collective Lantern Corps, the Anti-Monitor is nearly freed from the Power Battery and revealed to have only succumbed partially to Nekron's influence (manifested by the visual Black Hand symbol seen on every Black Lantern only being half completed), demanding that he be freed so that he could exact revenge on Nekron for his imprisonment.Blackest Night #7 (February 2010)Green Lantern Corps (vol. 4) #46 As part of the final 'coup de grace' against the Black Lantern Corps, the Entity also commands \\"Anti-Monitor of Qward - Live\\", which frees him from the Black Power Battery - destroying it in the process. It was the Anti-Monitor's physical corpse, coupled with Black Hand's presence as the entity of Death, that served as the full source of the Black Lantern Corps' power. Black Lanterns are able to read the emotions as colored auras that correlate to the Emotional Spectrum. Multiple emotions read as a multi- colored aura, while unreadable emotions come out as white.Blackest Night: Titans #2 (November 2009) Furthermore, demonic and underworld dwellers (such as Etrigan the Demon) are read with a black aura, apparently as unreadable as the white one due to their dead nature. A state of profound suspended animation is enough to fool a Black Lantern by making the target of suspended animation invisible to the senses of the Black Lantern.Blackest Night: Batman #3 (October 2009) Emotionless hearts such as the Scarecrow's render their bearers equally invisible to the Black Lanterns. When facing beings with warped mental states, or otherwise addled minds (such as Bizarro), the correlation between the emotion detected and the actual color that the Black Lanterns see is inverted.Superman/Batman #66 (November 2009) In addition to the abilities granted to them by the rings, Black Lanterns retain any skills and superpowers they may have had in life. =Vulnerabilities= Black Lanterns are vulnerable to white light and a combination of green light with another Corps' light. Once a black power ring is destroyed, the corpse it animates becomes inert. Kimiyo Hoshi and Halo can completely destroy Black Lanterns by using their light-based powers.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #40 (December 2009)Outsiders (vol. 4) #25 (December 2009) Conner Kent used the Medusa Mask to destroy two Black Lanterns by forcing them to experience the full force of Emotional Spectrum, irritating their black power rings enough that they remove themselves from their bearers and flee.Blackest Night: Superman #3 (December 2009) The Black Lanterns are also vulnerable to Wonder Woman's Lasso of Truth.Blackest Night: Wonder Woman #1 (January 2010) The \\"touch\\" of a Black Lantern, typically used to remove their victims' hearts and drain them of emotional energy, can also sever the connection between other Black Lanterns and their black power ring.Teen Titans (vol. 3) #78 (February 2010) Barry Allen was able to deactivate the black rings that were 'targeting' him and Hal Jordan by using time travel, jumping two seconds into the future so that the rings would shut down when they could not sense their 'assigned' wearers.Blackest Night #6 (February 2010) One common way of stopping a Black Lantern is to injure them faster than their ring is able to regenerate their body (such as the plasma that a Red Lantern vomits out, a mutated pitcher plant with strong digestive liquids, or the intense heat at Mogo's core).Catwoman (vol. 3) #83 (January 2010)The Phantom Stranger #42 (January 2010) Others that have proven resistant to the Black Lantern rings are either those who have wielded a power ring before or generally otherworldly beings such as Etrigan the Demon, who lacks a human heart and human emotions, Atrocitus, whose heart was replaced by his ring, the Shade, who is truly immortal and thus cannot die, and Osiris, whose magical nature allowed him some semblance of control over the ring. Don Hall (the original Dove) was immune to recruitment into the Black Lantern Corps as he was \\"at peace\\", which destroyed the Black Lantern Rings that attempted to recruit him. Another vulnerability of their rings power is that the odd physics behind magical power can dumbfound their abilities, as was the case when Arthur's daughter Serenity cast protection spells which disrupted the blackout effect of his power ring.Justice League (vol. 3) #26 Other versions In the Flashpoint universe, the successful murder of William Hand at the hands of the Red Lantern called Atrocitus freed Nekron from imprisonment long before several of the different colored Lantern Corps and the long-prophesied \\"War of Light\\" ever erupted across the Universe. Shortly after being released, Nekron used his dark powers to create the Black Lantern Corps using the corpses of the Green Lanterns and countless other lifeforms that have fallen before him. Like in the original DCU, Nekron is leading his Black Lanterns on a quest to eradicate all life in the universe. As of now, over 200 of the Sectors under the jurisdiction of the Guardians of the Universe, save for those that have already been rend asunder by a roving army of soulless, renegade Manhunter drones, have been systematically wiped out by Nekron and his forces. Of the 2,793 remaining sectors left, at least half of them have come under attack from the Black Lantern Corps. =The New 52: Futures End= In the possible future of Futures End set five years later: * Krona is reanimated as a Black Lantern and leads his Black Lanterns against Hal Jordan and Relic.Green Lantern: Futures End #1 * Sinestro smashes Lyssa Drak's skull on the ground, which summons a Black Lantern Power Ring, and Sinestro uses it to reanimate his Corps as Black Lanterns.Sinestro: Futures End #1 In other media * In Green Lantern: The Animated Series, the clothing portions of Aya's body change to black after Aya takes over the Anti-Monitor's body. Her agenda, while initially is eliminating all emotion from the universe, eventually changes to destroying organic life (by manipulating the Big Bang) and filling the universe with self-replicating machines instead. This is likely an allusion to the Black Lantern Corps, although at no point does her emblem changes from the regular Green Lantern shape. Also, when the heroes investigate Scar's chambers for clues, a Black Book with the Corps' symbol is visible on a shelf. * In Injustice 2, the Black Lantern Corps is represented by Hal Jordan's two \\"Death\\" palette swaps. The Black Lantern emblem also appears on certain equipable body armor gear for Green Lantern.

Location Ombaci is located in Arua District, in the West Nile sub-region, in Northern Uganda. It is located about , by road, north east of the central business district of Arua. The geographical coordinates of Ombaci are:03¬∞03'53.0\\"N, 30¬∞56'17.0\\"E (Latitude:3.064722; Longitude:30.938056). Ombaci lies at an average elevation of above sea level. Overview Ombaci, in the local Lugbara language, loosely translated, means \\"enmity exists\\", a reference to past conflicts in the area. In this neighborhood, as one travels north from Arua, the road forks into two. The left fork, called Kaya Highway continues north-westwards to Koboko, Oraba and Kaya, South Sudan. The right fork, called Rhino Camp Road continues north-eastwards to Wandi and eventually to Rhino Camp. Three of the most prominent landmarks in the neighborhood, are (a) Ombaci Primary School (b) Ombaci Roman Catholic Church and (c) St. Joseph's College Ombaci. It is in this location that the Ombaci Massacre occurred, in June 1981. Ombaci Massacre In April 1979, Idi Amin Dada was toppled from power by the Tanzania People's Defence Force (TPDF) and the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA). Idi Amin was a native son of the West Nile sub-region and many of the soldiers in his army came from this region too. As the victorious UNLA soldiers marched northwards to Arua, civilians, and former Amin soldiers took refugee in the compound of the Catholic mission and St. Joseph's College Ombaci, both of which were surrounded by a common perimeter fence. On Wednesday, 24 June 1981, six months into the second reign of Apollo Milton Obote, UNLA soldiers arrived at the Ombaci Catholic Mission and adjoining secondary school. They began to indiscriminately kill civilians, women, children and the elderly; by shooting, bludgeoning, stabbing, lancing, stomping, kicking and exploding ordinance (rocket propelled grenades). The exact number of people killed is not accurately known. Credible sources have quoted a number as \\"over 80\\". Another credible source reports that the secondary school grounds contain a mass grave for 97 victims. A large number of survivors, estimated at about 400 were still alive in May 2019, living with physical and mental injuries as a result of the assault.

Statement If x1, x2,..., xd are d complex numbers that are linearly independent over the rational numbers, and y1, y2,...,yl are l complex numbers that are also linearly independent over the rational numbers, and if dl > d + l, then at least one of the following dl numbers is transcendental: :\\\\exp(x_i y_j),\\\\quad (1\\\\leq i\\\\leq d, 1\\\\leq j\\\\leq l). The most interesting case is when d = 3 and l = 2, in which case there are six exponentials, hence the name of the result. The theorem is weaker than the related but thus far unproved four exponentials conjecture, whereby the strict inequality dl > d + l is replaced with dl ‚â• d + l, thus allowing d = l = 2\\\\. The theorem can be stated in terms of logarithms by introducing the set L of logarithms of algebraic numbers: :\\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\\\\\{\\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}\\\\,:\\\\,e^\\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{Q}}\\\\\\\\}. The theorem then says that if Œªij are elements of L for i = 1, 2 and j = 1, 2, 3, such that Œª11, Œª12, and Œª13 are linearly independent over the rational numbers, and Œª11 and Œª21 are also linearly independent over the rational numbers, then the matrix :M=\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\lambda_{11}&\\\\lambda_{12}&\\\\lambda_{13} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\lambda_{21}&\\\\lambda_{22}&\\\\lambda_{23}\\\\end{pmatrix} has rank 2. History A special case of the result where x1, x2, and x3 are logarithms of positive integers, y1 = 1, and y2 is real, was first mentioned in a paper by Leonidas Alaoglu and Paul Erd≈ës from 1944 in which they try to prove that the ratio of consecutive colossally abundant numbers is always prime. They claimed that Carl Ludwig Siegel knew of a proof of this special case, but it is not recorded.Alaoglu and Erd≈ës, (1944), p.455: \\"Professor Siegel has communicated to us the result that q x, r x and s x can not be simultaneously rational except if x is an integer.\\" Using the special case they manage to prove that the ratio of consecutive colossally abundant numbers is always either a prime or a semiprime. The theorem was first explicitly stated and proved in its complete form independently by Serge LangLang, (1966), chapter 2, section 1. and Kanakanahalli RamachandraRamachandra, (1967/68). in the 1960s. Five exponentials theorem A stronger, related result is the five exponentials theorem,Waldschmidt, (1988), corollary 2.2. which is as follows. Let x1, x2 and y1, y2 be two pairs of complex numbers, with each pair being linearly independent over the rational numbers, and let Œ≥ be a non-zero algebraic number. Then at least one of the following five numbers is transcendental: :e^{x_1 y_1}, e^{x_1 y_2}, e^{x_2 y_1}, e^{x_2 y_2}, e^{\\\\gamma x_2/x_1}. This theorem implies the six exponentials theorem and in turn is implied by the as yet unproven four exponentials conjecture, which says that in fact one of the first four numbers on this list must be transcendental. Sharp six exponentials theorem Another related result that implies both the six exponentials theorem and the five exponentials theorem is the sharp six exponentials theorem.Waldschmidt, (2005), theorem 1.4. This theorem is as follows. Let x1, x2, and x3 be complex numbers that are linearly independent over the rational numbers, and let y1 and y2 be a pair of complex numbers that are linearly independent over the rational numbers, and suppose that Œ≤ij are six algebraic numbers for 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ 3 and 1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ 2 such that the following six numbers are algebraic: :e^{x_1 y_1-\\\\beta_{11}}, e^{x_1 y_2-\\\\beta_{12}}, e^{x_2 y_1-\\\\beta_{21}}, e^{x_2 y_2-\\\\beta_{22}}, e^{x_3 y_1-\\\\beta_{31}}, e^{x_3 y_2-\\\\beta_{32}}. Then xi yj = Œ≤ij for 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ 3 and 1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ 2\\\\. The six exponentials theorem then follows by setting Œ≤ij = 0 for every i and j, while the five exponentials theorem follows by setting x3 = Œ≥/x1 and using Baker's theorem to ensure that the xi are linearly independent. There is a sharp version of the five exponentials theorem as well, although it as yet unproven so is known as the sharp five exponentials conjecture.Waldschmidt, (2005), conjecture 1.5 This conjecture implies both the sharp six exponentials theorem and the five exponentials theorem, and is stated as follows. Let x1, x2 and y1, y2 be two pairs of complex numbers, with each pair being linearly independent over the rational numbers, and let Œ±, Œ≤11, Œ≤12, Œ≤21, Œ≤22, and Œ≥ be six algebraic numbers with Œ≥ ‚â† 0 such that the following five numbers are algebraic: :e^{x_1 y_1-\\\\beta_{11}}, e^{x_1 y_2-\\\\beta_{12}}, e^{x_2 y_1-\\\\beta_{21}}, e^{x_2 y_2-\\\\beta_{22}}, e^{(\\\\gamma x_2/x_1)-\\\\alpha}. Then xi yj = Œ≤ij for 1 ‚â§ i, j ‚â§ 2 and Œ≥x2 = Œ±x1. A consequence of this conjecture that isn't currently known would be the transcendence of eœÄ¬≤, by setting x1 = y1 = Œ≤11 = 1, x2 = y2 = iœÄ, and all the other values in the statement to be zero. Strong six exponentials theorem Baker's theorem, while the four exponentials conjectures are detailed at the four exponentials conjecture article. A further strengthening of the theorems and conjectures in this area are the strong versions. The strong six exponentials theorem is a result proved by Damien Roy that implies the sharp six exponentials theorem.Roy, (1992), section 4, corollary 2. This result concerns the vector space over the algebraic numbers generated by 1 and all logarithms of algebraic numbers, denoted here as L‚àó. So L‚àó is the set of all complex numbers of the form :\\\\beta_0+\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\beta_i\\\\log\\\\alpha_i, for some n ‚â• 0, where all the Œ≤i and Œ±i are algebraic and every branch of the logarithm is considered. The strong six exponentials theorem then says that if x1, x2, and x3 are complex numbers that are linearly independent over the algebraic numbers, and if y1 and y2 are a pair of complex numbers that are also linearly independent over the algebraic numbers then at least one of the six numbers xi yj for 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ 3 and 1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ 2 is not in L‚àó. This is stronger than the standard six exponentials theorem which says that one of these six numbers is not simply the logarithm of an algebraic number. There is also a strong five exponentials conjecture formulated by Michel WaldschmidtWaldschmidt, (1988). It would imply both, the strong six exponentials theorem and the sharp five exponentials conjecture. This conjecture claims that if x1, x2 and y1, y2 are two pairs of complex numbers, with each pair being linearly independent over the algebraic numbers, then at least one of the following five numbers is not in L‚àó: :x_1y_1,\\\\,x_1y_2,\\\\,x_2y_1,\\\\,x_2y_2,\\\\,x_1/x_2. All the above conjectures and theorems are consequences of the unproven extension of Baker's theorem, that logarithms of algebraic numbers that are linearly independent over the rational numbers are automatically algebraically independent too. The diagram on the right shows the logical implications between all these results. Generalization to commutative group varieties The exponential function uniformizes the exponential map of the multiplicative group . Therefore, we can reformulate the six exponential theorem more abstractly as follows: :Let and take to be a non-zero complex-analytic group homomorphism. Define to be the set of complex numbers for which is an algebraic point of . If a minimal generating set of over has more than two elements then the image is an algebraic subgroup of . (In order to derive the classical statement, set = and note that is a subset of ). In this way, the statement of the six exponentials theorem can be generalized to an arbitrary commutative group variety over the field of algebraic numbers. This generalized six exponential conjecture, however, seems out of scope at the current state of transcendental number theory. For the special, but interesting cases and , where are elliptic curves over the field of algebraic numbers, results towards the generalized six exponential conjecture were proven by Aleksander Momot.Momot, ch. 7 These results involve the exponential function and a Weierstrass function \\\\wp resp. two Weierstrass functions \\\\wp, \\\\wp' with algebraic invariants g_2, g_3, g_2', g_3', instead of the two exponential functions e^{y_1z}, e^{y_2z} in the classical statement. Let and suppose is not isogenous to a curve over a real field and that is not an algebraic subgroup of . Then is generated over either by two elements , or three elements which are not all contained in a real line , where is a non-zero complex number. A similar result is shown for .Momot, ch. 7 NotesReferences   * External links * * Category:Transcendental numbers Category:Exponentials Category:Theorems in number theory Category:Conjectures ","title":"Six exponentials theorem"},{"id":"15114521","text":"Gmina Pogorzela is an urban-rural gmina (administrative district) in Gosty≈Ñ County, Greater Poland Voivodeship, in west-central Poland.

He was a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and served as a Senator for Western Australia from 1965 to 1981. He held ministerial office in the Whitlam Government as Minister for Repatriation and Compensation (1974‚Äì1975) and Minister for Social Security (1975). He was known for his views on Australian foreign policy and after leaving politics became an editorial writer for The Australian. Early career Wheeldon was born in Subiaco, Western Australia and educated at Perth Modern School and the University of Western Australia. He graduated in arts and law and then worked as a solicitor. He was later President of the Western Australian Young Liberals, but resigned in protest at Robert Menzies' attempt to ban the Communist Party of Australia, declaring that it \\"seemed rather fatuous to call itself the Liberal Party and then introduce a bill like that.\\" Political career At the 1964 half-Senate election, Wheeldon was elected to the Australian Senate, representing the Australian Labor Party. His term commenced on 1 July 1965. He strongly opposed the Vietnam War and (though no supporter of Communism) visited North Vietnam at the invitation of the North Vietnam peace committee, while Australia was involved in fighting in South Vietnam. In 1967, he spoke against the war in the United States with Jim Cairns. According to Senator John Faulkner, Wheeldon \\"... showed real passion for the causes he believed in: his opposition to the Vietnam War, his support for the independence of East Timor, his abhorrence of apartheid and his deep concern about Soviet imperialism.\\" Wheeldon was appointed Minister for Repatriation and Compensation in June 1974 in Gough Whitlam's third ministry and was responsible for implementing Whitlam's ambitious plan to establish a national compensation scheme. In addition, he was appointed Minister for Social Security in June 1975 when Bill Hayden was appointed Treasurer. Both appointments were terminated by the dismissal of the Whitlam government in November 1975. Wheeldon remained a senator until 30 June 1981, having chosen not to contest the 1980 election.Parliamentary Handbook In 1968, Wheeldon was suspected by Charles Spry, the Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) of having been compromised by contact Wheeldon was alleged to have had with a female member of the staff of the French embassy in Canberra, who had what appeared to be a personal relationship with Soviet diplomatic staff who were suspected of being intelligence agents. In a declassified top secret \\"Note to Prime Minister\\" in 1968 (apparently prepared for the benefit of Prime Minister John Gorton), Spry characterised Wheeldon's actions as \\"consistent with those of at least a collaborator with the RIS [Russian Intelligence Service]. He may be a recruited agent.\\" Wheeldon was never questioned about Spry's suspicions, and the young woman who was the sole source of the accusations against him left the country and admitted herself to the Horton Hospital at Surrey, a psychiatric institution formerly known as the London County Asylum. A declassified \\"top secret\\" ASIO Minute from 1974 indicates that ASIO officers had \\"considerable doubts\\" at the time about the truthfulness of the young woman who claimed to be the connection between Wheeldon and the suspected Soviet agents, and that these doubts were not reflected in the file specifying the young woman's accusations against Wheeldon. The note suggests that the file Spry used to brief Prime Minister's Holt and Gorton did not reflect these doubts, either. According to Ian Hancock's biography of John Gorton, in 1968 Spry sought to block Wheeldon's fianc√©e, Judith Werner (now Judith Wheeldon) from entering Australia on the grounds that her father was a member of the Communist Party, USA, but \\"Gorton would have none of it. He brusquely dismissed both Spry and his file... he had no time for public servants who behaved as a law unto themselves\\". In 1968, Wheeldon was one of the leading critics in the Australian parliament of the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia. In 1978, Wheeldon was one of the primary authors of \\"Human Rights in the Soviet Union\\", a report of the Australian parliament's Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. The report was harshly critical of the Soviet Union. In 1980, Wheeldon served as a parliamentary adviser to Australia's permanent delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. After politics In 1980, while serving as part of Australia's delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, Wheeldon rekindled an old friendship with Rupert Murdoch, who offered him a position as Associate Editor of The Australian newspaper. Wheeldon was chief editorial writer for The Australian from 1981 to 1995. In addition, he sometimes wrote articles for the monthly magazine Quadrant and other periodicals. He died at his house in Sydney, survived by his wife, Judith (headmistress of Abbotsleigh School for Girls, 1996‚Äì2005) and their son, and a daughter and a son from his first marriage.

On September 17, 1918, the school began regular classes, which had their own ceremonial opening 5 days later.http://old.redstar.ru/2008/07/12_07/3_03.html–ï. –í. –ó–µ–º—Å–∫–æ–≤ ¬´–¢–∞—à–∫–µ–Ω—Ç—Å–∫–æ–µ –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–∑–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ. –û—á–µ—Ä–∫–∏ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏. –ì–ª–∞–≤–∞ 1¬ª: –ü–æ–¥–≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–∫–∞ –∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω—ã—Ö –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∏—Ä–æ–≤ —Ä–∞–∑–≤–µ—Ä–Ω—É–ª–∞—Å—å —Å —Å–∞–º–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–∞ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–π –ê—Ä–º–∏–∏. –î–ª—è —ç—Ç–æ–π —Ü–µ–ª–∏ –ø–æ –≤—Å–µ–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã–≤–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –∫—É—Ä—Å—ã –ø–æ –ø–æ–¥–≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–∫–µ –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∞. –ü–æ–¥–æ–±–Ω—ã–µ –∫—É—Ä—Å—ã —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–≤–∞–ª–∏—Å—å —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –Ω–∞ —Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ö –∏ –≤ –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–∏—Ö –∞—Ä–º–∏—è—Ö. –í –º–∞—Ä—Ç–µ 1918 –≥. –∏–º–µ–ª–æ—Å—å 13 —Å—Ç–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞—Ä–Ω—ã—Ö –∫—É—Ä—Å–æ–≤, –≤ —è–Ω–≤–∞—Ä–µ 1919 –≥. ‚Äî 63, –≤ —è–Ω–≤–∞—Ä–µ 1920 –≥. ‚Äî 91. –ö –∫–æ–Ω—Ü—É –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã –≤ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ –Ω–∞—Å—á–∏—Ç—ã–≤–∞–ª–æ—Å—å —Å–≤—ã—à–µ 150 –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ- —É—á–µ–±–Ω—ã—Ö –∑–∞–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–π —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ç–∏–ø–∞ –∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª—è. –ó–∞ –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ 1918‚Äî1921 –≥–≥. –≥–æ–¥–æ–≤ –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö –∫—É—Ä—Å–∞—Ö –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏–ª–∏ –æ–∫–æ–ª–æ 60 000 —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫. At the time, the basis of training was political indoctrination and immersion in military subjects, with tactical training being given particular attention. During the Great Patriotic War (known in the West as the Second World War), the school prepared about 8,000 commanders to fight in the Red Army against the Wehrmacht. Many who graduated at the time fought in the Eastern Front, including in the Battle of Moscow in 1941 and the Siege of Leningrad in 1943. On March 28, 1957, the banners of the school, which were previously stored in the Central Museum of the Soviet Army, were delivered to the school from Moscow. By July 1970, the school was exporting its students to other Soviet universities, as well as importing cadets from other cadet schools, which would later make up the 1st Cadet Battalion. In the 80s, graduates of the school were immediately commissioned into the Soviet Army and transferred across the Afghan border with the Uzbek SSR to participate in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. On 26 March 1993, it was reestablished by the Ministry of Defense of Uzbekistan just the Tashkent Higher All-Arms Command School. In 2017, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, ordered that the school be reestablished as the Academy of the Armed Forces of Uzbekistan.http://www.ww2.dk/new/army/schools/tvoku.htmhttps://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/centralasia/uzbek- army.htmhttps://www.armyupress.army.mil/Journals/Military-Review/English- Edition-Archives/Jan-Feb-2019/Ibragimov-Priorities/  References  Links  *Alumni Website *–¢–í–û–ö–£ 100 –ª–µ—Ç Category:Military history of Uzbekistan Category:History of Tashkent Category:1991 disestablishments Category:Education and training establishments of the Soviet Ground Forces Category:Military academies of Uzbekistan Category:Military command schools ","title":"Tashkent Higher All-Arms Command School"},{"id":"15114555","text":"Gmina Granowo is a rural gmina (administrative district) in Grodzisk Wielkopolski County, Greater Poland Voivodeship, in west-central Poland.

It has been claimed as the first lager brewery in the United Kingdom,\\"First lager brew house 'at risk': Britain's first lager brewery has been added to English Heritage's endangered properties list.\\", BBC News, June 30, 2004. Retrieved January 12, 2008. although the claim is disputed. It closed in 1920. The building, now the Anglo Trading Estate, is a grade II* listed building and is on English Heritage's Heritage at Risk Register, and Mendip District Council's Historic Buildings at Risk Register.  1864 to 1914 ‚Äì Establishment and Growth  The brewery was built, in 1864, for Morrice, Cox and Clarke of London, and was initially called the Shepton Mallet Pale Ale Brewery. During the construction work on the site, pottery kilns used to make Severn Valley Ware, dating from the 1st to 2nd century were discovered. The limestone four-storey building was built in an Italiente style has five-storey towers at either side. The top floors, each long held barley and malt stores in six bins, each of which held 450 quarters and tanks for the water supply. Below these were the malting floors, supplied via wooden shoots, and kilns, one of which was measured as being by . In 1871, the business was sold by auction to Hill, Garton and Company of Southampton, who subsequently expanded and modernised it. In 1872 the Pale Ale Brewery was renamed the Anglo-Bavarian Brewery. It has been asserted that this was in reference to the employment, by the new owners, of some brewers from Bavaria in order to produce a German-style beer, and that what is now called lager was brewed from that year.Davis, p60, quoting Col. Garton, a descendant of the Garton family The writer Alfred Barnard, who visited the brewery in 1890, refers to a report from the British Commission on Beers which describes a beer from the Anglo- Bavarian brewery exhibited in Vienna as \\"combining the special properties of high class English Ales, with those of the lighter beers brewed upon the Bavarian lines\\" which, it has been claimed, supports the belief that the Anglo-Bavarian was brewing a form of lager.Davis, p29 and p60, quoting Barnard However Barnard's account of his own visit to the brewery only mentions \\"running\\" ale (for immediate consumption) and \\"stock ale\\", (also quoted in Davis, p22) and newspaper advertisements for the Anglo-Bavarian Brewery Company in the mid-1870s show it brewing pale ale, mild ale, strong ale, porter, stout and amber ale, but not lager. The brewery site was lit throughout by electricity by 1889, generated by a dynamo powered by a steam engine, allowing work to continue at night. In 1890 the brewery employed over 200 people (compared with about 50 in the early 1870s). There was no natural source of water on the brewery site and so water was supplied by the local water company. This was sufficient for a while but by the end of 19th century an additional source was required. A spring was discovered at Bowlish which proved able to provide seemingly unlimited supplies of very pure water. Disposal of the effluents produced by the brewery were also a major problem and pollution of the River Sheppey was a source of much discontent amongst land owners further down the valley from 1877 until the closure of the brewery in 1921. In 1890 it was reported that the beer brewed at the Anglo-Bavarian was sold throughout England and the Channel Islands by 250 agents. However the brewery‚Äôs main area of sales was export. Beginning in 1875, beer was transported to a bottler in London, from where it was shipped to Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa, South America and the West Indies. Overseas sales were in the order of 1.8 million bottles per year. As well as providing employment to Shepton Mallet, the Anglo-Bavarian Brewery also provided the services of its fire brigade to the town (and the wider surrounding area) between 1868 and 1921. The brewery fire brigade were called upon many times, most notably in 1904 for a fire at Shepton Mallet Prison.  1914 to 1921 ‚Äì Decline and Closure  The reasons for the decline of the Anglo-Bavarian Brewery are various. Amongst them is anti-German feeling following the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. The inclusion of the word Bavarian on the label of the brewery's bottles led to them being removed from shop shelves throughout the United Kingdom and overseas. The Brewery and its beer were quickly renamed as Anglo but this did not have much effect and trade rapidly declined. The post-war recession and the rise of the temperance movement also helped to damage the chances of the Shepton Mallet brewery returning to its earlier levels of success. By 1920 the brewery was employing only a few men and the Garton Company which still owned the Anglo Brewery was reviewing its business interests. In April 1921 all of the machinery, plant and other fittings of the brewery were put up for sale by auction, from the office furniture to the one remaining cart horse named Darling. In August of that year the brewery site itself, and all of the brewery‚Äôs lands including Bowlish House, was also put up for auction.  1927 to 1947 ‚Äì Resurrection and Requisition  The brewery buildings were again put up for sale in 1926, this time for demolition purposes. However, there was little interest and the site remained intact. In 1927 the site was bought by a Mr Bennett who began to install new machinery, and by 1934 a new Anglo-Bavarian Brewery company was registered to once again carry on beer and cider production. The word Bavarian was dropped again as the outbreak of the Second World War approached and in 1939 the brewery site (and all the machinery) was requisitioned by the Air Ministry. (Cider production was transferred to a site in Darshill under the name of the Anglo Apple Mills.) The Anglo Trading Estate, Shepton Mallet  1947 to date ‚Äì The Anglo Trading Estate, and proposals for future development  After the War, half the site was restored to the Bennett family, but again without any machinery which had been removed to aid the war effort. In April 1947 the buildings began their new life as the Anglo Trading Estate, providing warehousing and distribution to a range of expanding local businesses such as Clarks the shoe-makers. The Air Ministry returned the remainder of the site in 1964. Ownership of the Trading Estate later passed to J H Haskins & Son Ltd, owners of the prominent furniture store in Shepton Mallet. In March 2008, they published plans to redevelop the site to include a hotel and conference facilities, as well as shops, offices, pubs, cafes, restaurants, a recording studio and housing. It is used for the production of Brothers Cider. It is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage.

The conjecture, along with two related, stronger conjectures, is at the top of a hierarchy of conjectures and theorems concerning the arithmetic nature of a certain number of values of the exponential function. Statement If x1, x2 and y1, y2 are two pairs of complex numbers, with each pair being linearly independent over the rational numbers, then at least one of the following four numbers is transcendental: :e^{x_1y_1}, e^{x_1y_2}, e^{x_2y_1}, e^{x_2y_2}. An alternative way of stating the conjecture in terms of logarithms is the following. For 1 ‚â§ i,j ‚â§ 2 let Œªij be complex numbers such that exp(Œªij) are all algebraic. Suppose Œª11 and Œª12 are linearly independent over the rational numbers, and Œª11 and Œª21 are also linearly independent over the rational numbers, then :\\\\lambda_{11}\\\\lambda_{22} eq\\\\lambda_{12}\\\\lambda_{21}.\\\\, An equivalent formulation in terms of linear algebra is the following. Let M be the 2√ó2 matrix :M=\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\lambda_{11}&\\\\lambda_{12} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\lambda_{21}&\\\\lambda_{22}\\\\end{pmatrix}, where exp(Œªij) is algebraic for 1 ‚â§ i,j ‚â§ 2\\\\. Suppose the two rows of M are linearly independent over the rational numbers, and the two columns of M are linearly independent over the rational numbers. Then the rank of M is 2. While a 2√ó2 matrix having linearly independent rows and columns usually means it has rank 2, in this case we require linear independence over a smaller field so the rank isn't forced to be 2. For example, the matrix :\\\\begin{pmatrix}1&\\\\pi \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\pi&\\\\pi^2\\\\end{pmatrix} has rows and columns that are linearly independent over the rational numbers, since œÄ is irrational. But the rank of the matrix is 1. So in this case the conjecture would imply that at least one of e, eœÄ, and eœÄ ¬≤ is transcendental (which in this case is already known since e is transcendental). History The conjecture was considered as early as the early 1940s by Atle Selberg who never formally stated the conjecture.Waldschmidt, (2006). A special case of the conjecture is mentioned in a 1944 paper of Leonidas Alaoglu and Paul Erd≈ës who suggest that it had been considered by Carl Ludwig Siegel.Alaoglu and Erd≈ës, (1944), p.455: \\"It is very likely that q x and p x cannot be rational at the same time except if x is an integer. ‚Ä¶ At present we can not show this. Professor Siegel has communicated to us the result that q x, r x and s x can not be simultaneously rational except if x is an integer.\\" An equivalent statement was first mentioned in print by Theodor Schneider who set it as the first of eight important, open problems in transcendental number theory in 1957.Schneider, (1957). The related six exponentials theorem was first explicitly mentioned in the 1960s by Serge LangLang, (1966), chapter 2 section 1. and Kanakanahalli Ramachandra,Ramachandra, (1967/8). and both also explicitly conjecture the above result.Waldschmidt, (2000), p.15. Indeed, after proving the six exponentials theorem Lang mentions the difficulty in dropping the number of exponents from six to four -- the proof used for six exponentials ‚Äújust misses‚Äù when one tries to apply it to four. Corollaries Using Euler's identity this conjecture implies the transcendence of many numbers involving e and œÄ. For example, taking x1 = 1, x2 = , y1 = iœÄ, and y2 = iœÄ, the conjecture -- if true -- implies that one of the following four numbers is transcendental: :e^{i\\\\pi}, e^{i\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{2}}, e^{i\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{2}}, e^{2i\\\\pi}. The first of these is just ‚àí1, and the fourth is 1, so the conjecture implies that eiœÄ is transcendental (which is already known, by consequence of the Gelfond‚ÄìSchneider theorem). An open problem in number theory settled by the conjecture is the question of whether there exists a non-integral real number t such that both 2t and 3t are integers, or indeed such that at and bt are both integers for some pair of integers a and b that are multiplicatively independent over the integers. Values of t such that 2t is an integer are all of the form t = log2m for some integer m, while for 3t to be an integer, t must be of the form t = log3n for some integer n. By setting x1 = 1, x2 = t, y1 = log2, and y2 = log3, the four exponentials conjecture implies that if t is irrational then one of the following four numbers is transcendental: :2, 3, 2^t, 3^t.\\\\, So if 2t and 3t are both integers then the conjecture implies that t must be a rational number. Since the only rational numbers t for which 2t is also rational are the integers, this implies that there are no non-integral real numbers t such that both 2t and 3t are integers. It is this consequence, for any two primes not just 2 and 3, that Alaoglu and Erd≈ës desired in their paper as it would imply the conjecture that the quotient of two consecutive colossally abundant numbers is prime, extending Ramanujan's results on the quotients of consecutive superior highly composite number.Ramanujan, (1915), section IV. Sharp four exponentials conjecture The four exponentials conjecture reduces the pair and triplet of complex numbers in the hypotheses of the six exponentials theorem to two pairs. It is conjectured that this is also possible with the sharp six exponentials theorem, and this is the sharp four exponentials conjecture.Waldschmidt, \\"Hopf algebras‚Ä¶\\" (2005), p.200. Specifically, this conjecture claims that if x1, x2, and y1, y2 are two pairs of complex numbers with each pair being linearly independent over the rational numbers, and if Œ≤ij are four algebraic numbers for 1 ‚â§ i,j ‚â§ 2 such that the following four numbers are algebraic: :e^{x_1 y_1-\\\\beta_{11}}, e^{x_1 y_2-\\\\beta_{12}}, e^{x_2 y_1-\\\\beta_{21}}, e^{x_2 y_2-\\\\beta_{22}}, then xi yj = Œ≤ij for 1 ‚â§ i,j ‚â§ 2\\\\. So all four exponentials are in fact 1. This conjecture implies both the sharp six exponentials theorem, which requires a third x value, and the as yet unproven sharp five exponentials conjecture that requires a further exponential to be algebraic in its hypotheses. Strong four exponentials conjecture Baker's theorem, while the lower two rows are detailed at the six exponentials theorem article. The strongest result that has been conjectured in this circle of problems is the strong four exponentials conjecture.Waldschmidt, (2000), conjecture 11.17. This result would imply both aforementioned conjectures concerning four exponentials as well as all the five and six exponentials conjectures and theorems, as illustrated to the right, and all the three exponentials conjectures detailed below. The statement of this conjecture deals with the vector space over the algebraic numbers generated by 1 and all logarithms of non-zero algebraic numbers, denoted here as L‚àó. So L‚àó is the set of all complex numbers of the form :\\\\beta_0+\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\beta_i\\\\log\\\\alpha_i, for some n ‚â• 0, where all the Œ≤i and Œ±i are algebraic and every branch of the logarithm is considered. The statement of the strong four exponentials conjecture is then as follows. Let x1, x2, and y1, y2 be two pairs of complex numbers with each pair being linearly independent over the algebraic numbers, then at least one of the four numbers xi yj for 1 ‚â§ i,j ‚â§ 2 is not in L‚àó. Three exponentials conjecture The four exponentials conjecture rules out a special case of non-trivial, homogeneous, quadratic relations between logarithms of algebraic numbers. But a conjectural extension of Baker's theorem implies that there should be no non-trivial algebraic relations between logarithms of algebraic numbers at all, homogeneous or not. One case of non-homogeneous quadratic relations is covered by the still open three exponentials conjecture.Waldschmidt, \\"Variations‚Ä¶\\" (2005), consequence 1.9. In its logarithmic form it is the following conjecture. Let Œª1, Œª2, and Œª3 be any three logarithms of algebraic numbers and Œ≥ be a non-zero algebraic number, and suppose that Œª1Œª2 = Œ≥Œª3. Then Œª1Œª2 = Œ≥Œª3 = 0\\\\. The exponential form of this conjecture is the following. Let x1, x2, and y be non-zero complex numbers and let Œ≥ be a non- zero algebraic number. Then at least one of the following three numbers is transcendental: :e^{x_1y}, e^{x_2y}, e^{\\\\gamma x_1/x_2}. There is also a sharp three exponentials conjecture which claims that if x1, x2, and y are non-zero complex numbers and Œ±, Œ≤1, Œ≤2, and Œ≥ are algebraic numbers such that the following three numbers are algebraic :e^{x_1 y-\\\\beta_1}, e^{x_2 y-\\\\beta_2}, e^{(\\\\gamma x_1/x_2)-\\\\alpha}, then either x2y = Œ≤2 or Œ≥x1 = Œ± x2. The strong three exponentials conjecture meanwhile states that if x1, x2, and y are non- zero complex numbers with x1y, x2y, and x1/x2 all transcendental, then at least one of the three numbers x1y, x2y, x1/x2 is not in L‚àó. As with the other results in this family, the strong three exponentials conjecture implies the sharp three exponentials conjecture which implies the three exponentials conjecture. However, the strong and sharp three exponentials conjectures are implied by their four exponentials counterparts, bucking the usual trend. And the three exponentials conjecture is neither implied by nor implies the four exponentials conjecture. The three exponentials conjecture, like the sharp five exponentials conjecture, would imply the transcendence of eœÄ¬≤ by letting (in the logarithmic version) Œª1 = iœÄ, Œª2 = ‚àíiœÄ, and Œ≥ = 1\\\\. Bertrand's conjecture Many of the theorems and results in transcendental number theory concerning the exponential function have analogues involving the modular function j. Writing q = e2œÄi for the nome and j() = J(q), Daniel Bertrand conjectured that if q1 and q2 are non-zero algebraic numbers in the complex unit disc that are multiplicatively independent, then J(q1) and J(q2) are algebraically independent over the rational numbers.Bertrand, (1997), conjecture 2 in section 5. Although not obviously related to the four exponentials conjecture, Bertrand's conjecture in fact implies a special case known as the weak four exponentials conjecture.Diaz, (2001), section 4. This conjecture states that if x1 and x2 are two positive real algebraic numbers, neither of them equal to 1, then œÄ¬≤ and the product are linearly independent over the rational numbers. This corresponds to the special case of the four exponentials conjecture whereby y1 = iœÄ, y2 = ‚àíiœÄ, and x1 and x2 are real. Perhaps surprisingly, though, it is also a corollary of Bertrand's conjecture, suggesting there may be an approach to the full four exponentials conjecture via the modular function j.

The church, as the adjoining monastery, was dedicated to Saint Andrew of Crete, and was named Saint Andrew in Krisei or by-the-Judgment (, Monƒì tŒøu HagiŒøu AndreŒøu en tƒì Krisei). Although heavily transformed during both the Byzantine and the Ottoman eras, it is one among the few churches in Istanbul still extant, whose foundation goes back to the sixth century. Location The building lies in the Istanbul district of Fatih, in the neighborhood of Kocamustafapa≈üa, along Koca Mustafa Pa≈üa Caddesi. It is placed inside the walled city, and not far from the church of Saint John of Stoudion, on the slopes of the seventh hill of Constantinople near the sea of Marmara. History= Byzantine period = At the beginning of the 5th century, Princess Arcadia, sister of Emperor Theodosius II (r. 408‚Äì450), ordered the construction, near the Gate of Saturninus,Janin (1953), 34. \\"A gate of the now vanished Constantinian wall of the city.\\" of a monastery dedicated to Saint Andrew. The building, named also Rodophylion () lay about west of the gate.M√ºller-Wiener (1977), p. 172. The monastery was later converted into a nunnery, mentioned for the first time in 792. The monastery of Saint Andrew was known under the appellation \\"by-the-Judgment\\", after the place where it lay, named \\"the Judgment\\" (, hƒì Krisis).The denomination derives from a burial place of criminals which lied nearby. Janin (1953), p. 35. Saint Andrew of Crete, a martyr of the fight against Byzantine Iconoclasm, killed on 20 November 766 in the Forum Bovis because of his opposition to the iconoclastic policies of Emperor Constantine V (r. 741‚Äì775), was buried there.It should be noticed that according to modern sources, the figure of Andrew of Crete, like those of many iconophile Saints lived during the iconoclastic period, is legendary. Brubaker (2011) Due to his popularity after the final triumph of Orthodoxy, the dedication of the church changed from Saint Andrew the Apostle to him. During the second half of the ninth century, Emperor Basil I (r. 867‚Äì886) wholly rebuilt the church, which possibly had been damaged during the iconoclastic fights. Around 1284, Princess Theodora Raoulaina, niece of Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259‚Äì1282) and wife of protovestiarios John Raoul Petraliphas, rebuilt the monastery and the church, deserving the appellation of second ktƒìtorissa. She spent the last fifteen years of her life in the monastery, and was buried there. Neglected during the Latin occupation of Constantinople, two Russian pilgrims visiting Constantinople in 1350 and between 1425 and 1450 mention the church, affirming that Saint Andrew was worshiped by many who were afflicted by sickness. At the beginning of the fifteenth century the surrounding area of the monastery was covered with vineyards, confirming the decline of the city.M√ºller-Wiener (1977), p. 173. = Ottoman period = The mosque in a drawing of 1877, from A.G. Paspates' Byzantine topographical studies After the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople the monastery, known by the Turks as Kƒ±zlar Kilisesi (\\"women's church\\"), continued to be inhabited for a while. Between 1486 and 1491 Kapiciba≈üiThe Kapiciba≈üi (\\"chief doorkeeper\\") was also master of ceremonies at receptions for foreign ambassadors. (and later Grand Vizier) Koca Mustafa Pasha, executed in 1512,Eyice (1955), p. 92. converted the church into a mosque.In the same period he converted also another byzantine church, this one placed in the Blachernae neighborhood, into a mosque, named after him Atik Mustafa Pasha Mosque. Some years later, the building of the monastery was endowed by his son-in-law, ≈ûeih √áelebi Efendi as Tekke for the Dervishes of the Halveti order. The dervishes were led at that time by the Sufi Master S√ºnb√ºl Efendi. His t√ºrbe, a popular destination for Muslim pilgrims, lies next to the mosque, which is also named after him. At the beginning of the sixteenth century there were quarrels between Sultan Selim I and ≈ûeih √áelebi, since the sultan wanted to pull down part of the monastery to build the Topkapƒ± Palace. He died in 1559 and his wife Safiye Hatun were both buried in a t√ºrbe in the yard of the mosque, near the t√ºrbe of Mustafa Pasha. Several Halveti Sheiks were buried in the cemetery behind the Mosque. Also in this period was born the tradition related to a chain hung to a cypress tree. The cypress is since long dead but still stands - together with the chain - inside a small round building in the yard of the mosque. The chain was swung between two people who were affirming contradictory statements, and the chain was said to hit the one who was telling the truth.Van Millingen (1912), p. 107. The dead Cypress where the chain once used as \\"lie detector\\" (now hidden in the wooden shelter) still hangs. The mosque lies on the right, while in foreground stands a column- shaped fountain. Behind the tree is visible the dome of the t√ºrbe of S√ºnb√ºl Efendi.This is one among many surviving folk tales concerning the mosque (like those about the √ßifte Sultanlar, the \\"twin Sultans\\"), all with Byzantine roots. They testify the merge between Ottoman and Greek popular culture and beliefs.G√ºlersoy (1976), p. 262. At the beginning of the 17th century, Defterdar (treasury minister) Ekmek√ßizade Ahmet Pa≈üa (d. 1618) let build a Medrese, the gates of the complex, a zaviye,A zaviye was a building designed specifically for gatherings of a Sufi or dervish brotherhood and a mekteb (school).M√ºller-Wiener (1977), p. 174 About one century later Hekimba≈üƒ± (Sultan's chief physician) Giridli Nuh Efendi (d. 1707) closed the Tekke and enlarged the Medrese, while in 1737 Kƒ±zlar Aƒüasƒ± Hacƒ± Be≈üir Aƒüa erected in the yard a column-shaped fountain. The earthquake of 1766 destroyed the dome of the building: it was rebuilt in 1768. During the 19th century, Mahmud II (r. 1808-1839) rebuilt the porch. In 1847‚Äì1848, Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I (r. 1839‚Äì1861) let the wall which encircles the complex be rebuilt. Some years later two fountains were erected in the yard of the mosque.M√ºller-Wiener (1977), p. 175. Finally, in 1953, the building was restored again. The tradition to light up the minaret of the mosques on the eve of the anniversary of the birth of Prophet Muhammad (Mawlid al-Nabi) was born in the Koca Mustafa Mosque.Mamboury, p. 258. Architecture Plan of the mosque, after Van Millingen, Byzantine Churches of Constantinople (1912) The building was originally of the ambulatory type, and is oriented in east- northeast - west-southwest direction. It has a central dome and a three apses, placed of the east side. An esonarthex and exonarthex are placed in the west side. On the other three sides the dome was originally surrounded by arcades surmounted by barrel vaults. During the Ottoman period the building underwent important alterations. The entrance is on the north side, where the Ottomans built an arcade covered by five domes. After the earthquake of 1766, the central dome was rebuilt. It is circular inside, octagonal outside, and rests on a high drum pierced by eight windows.Van Millingen (1912), p. 115. On the north and south sides of the main dome, two half domes were added during the Ottoman period. They are also both pierced by three large windows, which outside look like dormers. All the domes rest on arches. The eastern arch sustaining the main dome is prolonged into a barrel vault bema, flanked by niches which originally led to the Prothesis and Diaconicon.Van Millingen (1912), p. 114. Only the diaconicon, covered with a cross-groined vault, survives. The west arch sustaining the dome is filled in with a triple arcade resting on two marble columns topped by cubic capitals. The inner narthex is divided into three bays. The north one is covered with an Ottoman dome. The central one is surmounted by a barrel vault, while the south one is surmounted by a cross groined vault. The last two are Byzantine.Van Millingen (1912), p. 113. The outer narthex is divided into five bays, the three central corresponding with those of the inner narthex. The central bay is covered by a central saucer dome resting on pendentives. It is separated by the two intermediate bays by columns set against pilasters. These two bays are covered with groined vaults put on ionic capitals, which resemble those used in the Church of Saints Sergius and Baccus. The two external bays are surmounted by central saucer domes and are separated from the others by projecting pilasters. The exterior is clearly Ottoman. It is made with finely dressed and polished stone, with no tiles, and has a stone moulded cornice. Above the drum of the halfdomes there is a stone molded cornice. The square base of the drum and the dome itself are faced with polished stone alternating with courses of three bricks set in a thick bed of mortar. Also the dome is crowned with a stone molded cornice. The roof is covered with lead. The Byzantine monastery has disappeared completely, except for an underground cistern which lies southeast of the mosque. A beautiful Byzantine carved door frame, possibly of the sixth century, belonging to the Medrese, has been brought to the Istanbul Archaeology Museum. Despite its architectural significance, the building has never undergone a systematic study.

In 1905 he published his doctoral thesis on poliomyelitis \\"Poliomyelitis acuta\\" in German, and the doctoral exam in 1906 qualified for the post of a docent for neurology at the Karolinska Institute, besides working as a district physician in the √ñstermalm district in Stockholm from 1907 to 1909. As a pupil of pediatrician Karl Oskar Medin, whom he held in high esteem, Wickman predominantly devoted himself to the studies of infantile paralysis (poliomyelitis). Besides his thesis, his 1907 publication Beitr√§ge zur Kenntnis der Heine-Medin‚Äôschen Krankheit has been rated as innovative. In the field of neurology he also published several articles. After 1909 Wickman spent more and more time abroad. He worked at the institute of pathology and anatomy in Helsingfors and did psychiatric studies in Paris. Repeatedly having to cope with financial difficulties, he spent his last two years in Breslau and Stra√üburg, in both places working as an assistant to Adalbert Czerny, the co-founder of modern pediatrics.Biographisches Lexikon der hervorragenden √Ñrzte der letzten f√ºnfzig Jahre, hg. von I. Fischer, 2 Bde., M√ºnchen/Berlin 1962, Bd. 2, S. 1679 f. At the age of 41 he took his life by a shot in the heart in April 1914. = Application for the Medin chair = The reasons for his suicide are not known, since Wickman did not leave a farewell letter or any other notes. Colleagues report that the failure of his application for the post of Professor of Pediatrics at the Karolinska Institute, which, until 1914, Medin had held, was a heavy blow for him.cp. Israel Holmgren, Ivar Wickman. En minnesg√§rd, in: Allm√§nna svenska l√§kartidningen, 11, 1914, p. 409-416. When the position was opened for applicants in 1912, Wickman was convinced that he had great chances of becoming successor to his mentor. The commission of the Stockholm Faculty of Medicine, however, preferred one of his two co-applicants in December 1913. On the one hand the members of the commission blamed Wickman for not having shown sufficient diversity in his research work: as many as half of his 22 scientific publications were dealing with polio. On the other hand, there was the serious reproach that he had not given a public audit lecture, which was part of the application procedure. He had reported sick because of his \\"insomnia‚Äú and only submitted a sick note by Professor Czerny, who acknowledged his pupil's good didactic capacities.cp. Axelsson 2003, p. 140-142. There is much reason to assume that Wickman eschewed the public lecture because of his stuttering, which considerably hampered his fluency of speech.Svenska m√§n och kvinnor, edited by Nils Bohman, 8 vols., Stockholm 1942-55, vol. 8, p. 333 = Work in polio research = Ivar Wickman's bronze bust (third from the left) in the Polio Hall of Fame Wickman became known for his achievements in polio research. As a pupil of Karl Oskar Medin and studying the findings of Jakob Heine and Adolf von Str√ºmpell he made detailed clinical and epidemiological studies to establish the hitherto controversial hypothesis that polio can be transferred through physical contact. He was provided with illustrative evidence mainly from the great Swedish epidemic of 1905 with a total of 1,031 recorded cases. Using the example of the small village Tr√§stena in today's T√∂reboda he could show that persons with a large contact surface were infected with polio more easily. Within only six weeks 49 children had contracted the disease. First he observed a spreading of the disease along streets and railway lines. After weeks of field trials Wickman succeeded in establishing the fact that the local school played a prominent role in the spread of the disease which henceforth he named Heine-Medin disease.cp. M.R. Smallman-Raynor / A.D. Cliff, Poliomyelitis - A World Geography. Emergence to Eradication, Oxford 2006, S. 99. Wickman published most of his articles and books in German and most of them were quickly translated into English. He came to the conclusion that polio was highly contagious. He suggested taking the so-called abortive and nonparalytic cases as seriously as the grave ones with paralysis, since they were ‚Äì as he emphasized ‚Äì instrumental in the spread of the disease. He assumed that the agent could be passed on by presumably healthy persons, and he was the first to find that polio was not exclusively, not even mainly, a disease affecting the central nervous system. Based on his observations he came to the conclusion that the incubation period of polio was three to four days, which had long been disputed but was confirmed in the middle of the twentieth century.Paul, 1971 p. 94 When he coined the term Heine-Medin disease he followed a suggestion of Sigmund Freud, who considered the naming of a disease after its discoverer less problematic than naming it after symptoms or agents. Wickman had found out that Heine's term Spinale Kinderl√§hmung (spinal infantile paralysis) and Medin's work on poliomyelitis only referred to parts of the disease. Hans Hekler: Jakob Heine ‚Äì vom K√∂nig geadelt und in aller Welt geehrt, pp. 12f: in: D'Kr√§z (Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der Stadt und Raumschaft Schramberg), Schramberg 1990, vol 10, p. 37‚Äì45 (PDF-file) Wickman's term, however, was not to assert itself in the long run. When in 1908, in Vienna, the discovery of the poliovirus by Karl Landsteiner and Erwin Popper was announced, Wickman did not give up his work as a clinical researcher and pediatrician. Neither did he join the Swedish team of clinical virologists. To him and his findings it did not make much difference, whether the polio agent was a virus or a bacterium.Paul 1971, p.94f. Wickman‚Äôs legacy and posthumous honours  Detail: Ivar Wickman's bronze bust Wickman's research work received only little immediate recognition outside the world of medical specialists. The obituary of his colleague Arnold Josefsson after Wickman's early death is an exception: ‚ÄúThe death of Ivar Wickman means the loss of an outstanding personality, not only for our country, but for the medical world as a whole.‚Äù Arnold Josefsson, Ivar Wickman, in: Hygiea, 76, 1914, S. 479-484.

Third in line after Heine and Medin, followed by Landsteiner and eleven more polio experts and two laymen (one of them US-president Franklin D. Roosevelt), his bronze bust was revealed.

Criteria A digital ticket must fulfill the following criteria: * Secure (unable to alter or counterfeit) * Portable (physical independence) * Off-line capable * Wide acceptability (In order to have the ticket generally accepted, some level of trust is needed.) * User-friendly In addition, another three requirements are also important for digital tickets, they are: * Viewable :The terms and description of the service should be objectively understood by both the service provider and consumer or owner, so the value of the ticket can be determined. Moreover, this is an essential property to trace the digital ticket. * State manageable :Tickets may also have a payment status, i.e., paid or unpaid, and/or reservation status, e.g., waiting list, reserved, or canceled. The status may be changed dynamically. In addition, the ticket ownership can be rewritten when the ticket is transferred. However, it is difficult to allow these changes while still guaranteeing security. * Decomposable :Combining two or more tickets is sometimes required to obtain a service or one ticket may comprise several parts. For example, a travel ticket can comprise an accommodation ticket and a plane ticket or a car rent ticket. Besides the criteria mentioned above, there are still several features that should be concerned, such as anonymity, transferability and repetitive usability. Lifecycle The ticket is first issued by the service provider or issuer. The ownership of a ticket may change after it was issued, by transferring the ticket. Either the issuer or owner of ticket might view the status of the ticket. Finally, it is redeemed by the current owner at the service provider. Image:Digitalticket.png =Creation= From creator's point of view, each digital ticket has certain structure, this could be expressed in a multilayer architecture depicted as follows: right Layer 1 Common ticket properties that do not depend on the ticket type: * Issuer * Promise (Details are given in upper layers) * Owner * Transferability * Number of times to be consumed * Valid period * View * Issuer's signature on above Layer 2 :Ticket properties defined by each industry Layer 3 :Ticket properties defined by each issuing company or individual =Transfer= Depending on the purpose of the ticket, it may be transferred. During the transfer process, the ticket should be visible to both parties involved. After the transfer process is done, the ownership of ticket has changed. The history of transfer should be recorded in either the ticket itself or the central database. =View= Ability to view the ticket is important to both the service provider and the owner of the ticket. The owner needs to know what his ticket actually is and the service provider needs to verify the ticket during redemption. The view could be achieved by properly designed hardware. =Redemption= A digital ticket always has certain value that could be redeemed at service provider. Normally after redeeming, the ticket is cleaned. Some tickets work for a period, and will only be deleted after this period. In the special case when the ticket is not given away after redeeming, it is called a pass.6957429665396 Implementation In order to make an implementation of the digital ticket system, a combination of two paradigms can be used. The first is the account- based system, which relies on central storage and network connections. The second is the smartcard-based system, which uses decentralized storage to store and transfer the ticket. =Account-based system= In an account-based system for tickets, the rights of the tickets are managed in accounts. Ticket changes in accounts can be made by communicating with a so-called account manager through a network. The trust in these systems can be seen from the service provider's and user's perspective, in which the former generally manages the whole system. This leads to an imbalanced trust relationship. Two other disadvantages of these systems are the need for protection of accounts against malicious users and the relatively large efforts that need to be done to store all the accounts for both the users and the service provider. Storage Generally, the storage and maintaining tasks of the account are assigned to the service provider. This leads to costs and efforts on his side. In some cases these systems could be shared by different service providers, but a need to make general agreements remains. Since the service provider normally has full control over the accounts, tickets could be deleted or altered and after that refuse to fulfill the service the initial ticket stands for. Authentication Typically ID and password are used in account-based systems to authenticate a user. This does not prevent fraud by the service provider. Several digital-cash systems deal with this by having a secret key generated at the user's PC, which remains out of hands of the service provider. This, however, is not sufficient when tickets are redeemed at the real service provider. Prevention of duplicate redemption Since the account management is completely in control of the service providers, unwanted actions such as copying tickets can easily be detected and traced back by them. =Smart card-based system= In smart card-based systems, tickets are stored on a smart card and are circulated by putting two smart cards in a reader and completing the transaction. The smart card itself takes care of the calculations that need to be done for safe transferring. Storage Tickets are stored on the smart cards. The smart cards can be provided by both the users and the service providers. The performance of current smart cards is limited, which makes asynchronous trading difficult. Different service providers are likely to use different standards, which makes it mandatory to have a different smart cards for different kinds of tickets. It is very useful to passengers. Authentication A secret key can be implemented in the smart card, which makes it possible to carry the card around and redeem a ticket without using a network connection. When the service provider distributes and issues the private keys on these cards, fraud from malicious service providers is still an issue. This also makes it hard for different service providers to share a smart card. Prevention of duplicate redemption Storage is generally maintained by the service provider. The smart card needs to be protected against multiplication. However, if the system is broken security is completely lost.

After appointments at the medical faculties at Breslau, Fribourg, Frankfurt and Berlin, in the late 1920s he went to Alexandria, Egypt, where he became the chief surgeon at the Jewish Hospital. The hospital was supported by donations from the Jewish community; its staff were of all faiths and its services were freely available to Jews, Christians, Muslims and others. In 1941, as reported in the British Medical Journal, Dr Katz performed one of the first successful adrenal gland grafts in medical history, saving the life of a patient who had not responded to synthetic hormones and drugs. Dr Katz was a very public figure, widely known and greatly admired in Alexandria, and had a tendency to be outspoken, a quality which did not put him in good stead with the Nasser regime. In 1959 he was charged with spying for Israel; he was tortured, convicted, and sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to life and in 1962 he was released following diplomatic intervention by the West German government and many professional testimonials from around the world. By then almost the entire Jewish community in Alexandria and the rest of Egypt had been driven out by the regime. Broken by his experiences in prison, Dr Katz lived out the remainder of his life quietly in Switzerland and died while on a visit to Athens in 1969 at the age of 71.

It was first published in 1765.Representative American Plays, by Arthur Hobson Quinn, The Century Company, 1917. It is set in the Parthian Empire in the 1st century A.D. during the Arsacid dynasty. Plot  It mostly follows the unities of time (happens in a short amount of time, usually 24 hours), place (happens in one place) and plot (one or few plot lines). It also has a five-act structure, and most of the characters follow decorum. However, with verisimilitude (or, the appearance of truth), the play is lacking. The idea that the entire plot line could happen within 24 to 48 hours is astonishing. In the first act, Phraates, an officer at court, and Gotarzes, a prince, discuss Prince Arsaces‚Äô triumphal return from foreign wars. But there is trouble at home. Vardanes, the brother of Gotarzes and Arsaces, is jealous of Arsaces' marital successes. Thermusa, Arsaces‚Äô stepmother and the Queen of Parthia, wants to avenge her son Vonones who was killed by Arsaces for treason. Vardanes and his officer, Lysias, decide to use Thermusa‚Äôs vengeance to destroy Arsaces. Meanwhile, Evanthe, whose father, King Bethas, has been imprisoned, is in love with Arsaces. But Artabanus, the King of Parthia, has illicit feelings for Evanthe. The plot then moves into Act Two; when Vardanes and Lysias hear Arsaces tell Bethas that he loves Evanthe, they decide to tell King Artabanus that Arsaces is a traitor for sympathizing with Parthian enemies. And that is all; like most plays with a five-act structure, there are usually one or two acts that are just one scene. This keeps the five-act structure, but does not mess with the believability of the plot. By the time the plot reaches Act Three, Thermusa is very angry because she knows King Artabanus is lusting after someone else. She tells this to Vardanes, who decides to use this to destroy Arsaces and take the throne of Parthia for himself. Arsaces asks for Evanthe‚Äôs hand in marriage in front of King Artabanus. Artabanus decides to let Arsaces have Evanthe because he promised Arsaces anything he wanted for being such an awesome child. Evanthe tells Arsaces that King Artabanus loves her, to which he replies that he loves her more. Vardanes then tells King Artabanus that Arsaces is a traitor. Act Four takes a sharp plot turn, which causes some incongruities. Phraates tells Gotarzes that he overheard Vardanes and Lysias talking about how they killed King Artabanus in his sleep. Vardanes and Lysias plan on blaming Arsaces, while Phraates and Gotarzes plan on telling the general Barzaphernes about who actually killed the king. Arsaces has been accused of the regicide and thrown in prison along with Bethas. They bond over their fear for Evanthe‚Äôs safety. Thermusa enters the prison to kill Arsaces, but she sees a bloody ghost of King Artabanus, which causes her to ‚Äúbrain‚Äù herself against the wall, committing suicide. Barzaphernes appears and releases Arsaces. Together, they plan to get Vardanes and make Parthia right once more. In the exciting conclusion of Act Five, Vardanes comes on to Evanthe, but she does not like it. Before Vardanes can hurt Evanthe, Lysias runs in and tells Vardanes that Arsaces has escaped and knows of Vardanes‚Äô plot. Then, a huge battle occurs, pitting Vardanes, Lysias and all of their followers against Arsaces, Barzaphernes, Phraates, Gotarzes and their men. Cleone, Evanthe‚Äôs maid, watches the battle from a window. Cleone believes Arsaces was killed in the battle by Vardanes, but it was really Phraates. Cleone tells this to Evanthe, who drinks a vial of poison. When Arsaces, who has taken down Vardanes, hears of Evanthe‚Äôs death, he impales himself on Barzaphernes‚Äô sword. In the end, only Barzaphernes and Gotarzes live.

She relocates in Baltimore with her sons Chris and Matt and takes a job at a gourmet food store managed by Lisa Coleman. Seventeen-year-old Chris (Chris O'Donnell) turns angry and aggressive while nine-year-old Matt (Charlie Korsmo) hides his deep sense of loss under a steely exterior. Beth is drawn into a relationship with Charles Simon, a musician who builds her self-esteem. However, after losing her job, she plunges into a five-day depression during which she refuses to leave her bedroom. Beth is an extremely vulnerable, easily discouraged person who cannot seem to get a grip on her circumstances. Chris falls in love with Jody, an older radiographer who lives in the same building. Matt falls under the influence of a young schoolmate who breaks into houses and steals VCRs. His dream is to get enough money to buy back their suburban house. Beth and her sons eventually pull themselves together, and realize that to abandon each other is not the answer. Beth tells her sons, \\"Heartbreak is life educating us,\\" and the lessons turn out to be worth learning. Main cast * Jessica Lange as Beth Macauley * Arliss Howard as Charles Simon * Joan Cusack as Jody * Chris O'Donnell as Chris Macauley * Kathy Bates as Lisa Coleman * Charlie Korsmo as Matt Macauley * Belita Moreno as Mrs. Buckley Reception The film received generally positive reviews, and has a score of 81% on Rotten Tomatoes based on sixteen reviews. Shelia Benson of the Los Angeles Times praised the film as \\"a tender, beautifully acted, diabolically droll film on the subject of love, loss and the sheer blissful unpredictability of life.\\" Roger Ebert said that the film \\"is the story of how a warm and believable suburban wife and mother becomes a widow who is trapped in a series of Hollywood improbabilities. The movie opens with enormous appeal and then spends its last hour chipping away at the sympathy it has earned. By the end, when some scenes are from the cliche factory and others seem to be missing altogether, I felt a great disappointment: The story started out too strongly to end as such a mess.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times recalled that \\"among the film's more memorable moments is the scene in which Beth, having collapsed into such depression that she sits in a littered apartment eating cold spaghetti out of a can, is serenaded by her musician friend to the tune of Bella Notte, the Italian restaurant song from Lady and the Tramp. Bruce Surtees's cinematography gives the film a warm, vibrant look that's particularly flattering to its star. The editing is so abrupt in spots that it suggests there may have been more to Men Don't Leave at some earlier stage.\\" Peter Travers of the Rolling Stone said that \\"Brickman has made an imperfect movie but not an impersonal one. Combining humor and heartbreak with rare grace, Men Don‚Äôt Leave means to get under your skin and does.\\" Lange's performance was praised by critics. =Box office= The film was unsuccessful at the box office, grossing just over $6 million in the US on a $7 million budget.

As a teen, he tested into Wuchang School, a prestigious secondary school, but then was expelled for spreading anti-Qing sentiments. He then went to study in Japan and became a student of the most important Chinese scholar and philologist Zhang Taiyan. Huang was regarded as the most important phonologist since the high Qing (1644 - 1912) and gained recognition at first through his literary criticism of the sixth century. Later on, he taught at a number of universities in mainland China. Huang's major contribution lies in his research on ancient Chinese phonology. He was the first to question established theories of rhyme schemes (patterns of sounds at the end of lines in poetry) in ancient literature. Huang proposed twenty-eight variations instead of the older version of twenty- six variations established by his teacher Zhang. He also proposed a new categorization of the ancient consonantal system that separated the oldest nineteen sounds from the existing theory of forty-one sounds . As an educator, Huang was highly respected for his innovative ways of teaching. His students particularly admired his integrity and courage in cases of political disagreement with university administrations. His personal life outside of academia was one with much drama as well, including multiple conflicts with authorities and allegedly nine marriages. He eventually died from over consumption of alcohol.  Early life = Childhood = Born in a large family, Huang Kan was the tenth child of Huang Yunhu (ÈªÑ‰∫ëÈπÑ) and Zhou Ruren(Âë®Â≠∫‰∫∫). Huang Yunhu was a high-ranking government official in the late Qing Dynasty. Although corruption was common among government officials during that time, he did not take part in such practices. As a result, his family was frugal despite Huang's political influence and academic achievements. As the second surviving son of the family, Huang Kan showed strong interest in literature and books in general from a very young age and reportedly could memorize texts verbatim upon first reading. At the young age of four, his family hired Jiang Shuhai, a retired government official and a family friend, as Huang Kan's tutor. Huang Kan, who not only read but also memorized the many books he read, quickly became well known as a prodigy in the area. = Early education = In 1903, at the age of eighteen, Huang Kan tested into the Hubei Liberal School, Wuchang Xuetang (‚ÄúÊπñÂåóÊôÆÈÄöÊñáÂ≠¶Â†Ç‚Äù, ‚ÄúÊ≠¶ÊòåÂ≠¶Â†Ç‚Äú). The Qing Dynasty, the last living Chinese imperial state, was on the verge of collapsing at this time. During the three years Huang Kan spent at this school, he was highly influenced by the progressive scholars and thinkers around him, and especially excited about the idea of revolution and rising up against the monarchy. Huang Kan was not afraid to challenge or embarrass authority figures. Multiple ‚Äúincidents‚Äù with a corrupt administrator eventually resulted in his being expelled from school. Huang Kan's father was old friends with Zhang Zhidong (Âº†‰πãÊ¥û), the Viceroy of Huguang (a very high-ranking position in the Qing government). Recognizing Huang Kan's talent and wanting to do a favor for his old friend, Zhang pulled strings to sponsor Huang Kan to study in Japan. Huang Kan started studying at Waseda University in 1903, which was during the period leading up to Xinhai Revolution, the revolution that eventually overthrew the Qing monarchy. He joined Tongmenghui (\\"Chinese United League\\"), a major resistance group against Qing Dynasty. Zhang Zhidong, being an official in the Qing government, consequently rescinded Huang's scholarship for Japan. Huang Kan then continued living in Japan as a political refugee. He became Zhang Taiyan's student there, learning philology and phonetics. Together with Zhang and Liu Shipei, the three were later termed \\"ÂúãÂ≠∏Â§ßÂ∏´ (masters of Chinese scholarship, sinology)\\". Aside from scholarly contributions, they also aided the revolution remotely by creating an influential political newspaper The People Journal (‚ÄúÊ∞ëÊä•‚Äù) in addition to publishing various individual political writings.  Professional life = As a linguist = Huang Kan and Zhang Taiyan were the last great masters in the Chinese philological tradition, and helped lay the foundation of modern Chinese linguistics. Huang was the first to propose a convincing initial systems of Old Chinese. In 1911, Huang Kan moved to Shanghai after his mother's death in Hubei. And from 1911 to 1914, he focused his study in three major works,: * Erya (Â∞îÈõÖ), the oldest living Chinese dictionary and encyclopedia; 3rd century BC before the Qin Dynasty; * Shuowen (ËØ¥Êñá), first dictionary to analyze structure of Chinese characters; early 2nd century during the Han Dynasty * and Guangyun (ÂπøÈüµ), a rhyme dictionary that categorizes characters by their sounds instead of writing; 1007-1008 during the Song Dynasty. Although the writing tradition of Chinese has maintained extensive records throughout centuries, the phonetics remains a topic of much debate. Huang reset the parameters of the phonetic development of the Chinese language (\\"Ê±âËØ≠Èü≥ÈüµÂ≠¶ \\") to nineteen consonants and twenty-eight vowels. Zhang Taiyan once said that no other work in history of Chinese linguistics, Xiaoxue (\\"Â∞èÂ≠¶\\", discipline that studies ancient Chinese) has ever reached the depth of Huang Kan. Huang further developed Zhang and Qian Xuantong's preliminary findings and published one of his most famous works Nineteen Sounds of Ancient Phonology„ÄäÂè§Èü≥ÂçÅ‰πùÁ∫Ω„Äãin 1924. In the book, he broke the sounds down by certain manners of articulation: * three kinds of sounds that involve the throat (ÂñâÈü≥) * three kinds of sounds that involve teeth (ÁâôÈü≥) * five kinds of sounds that involve the tongue (ËàåÈü≥) * four kinds of sounds that involve teeth (ÈΩøÈü≥) * four kinds of sounds that involve lips (ÂîáÈü≥) (Note: \\"teeth\\" in modern Chinese is a disyllabic word, \\"ÁâôÈΩø\\" but Huang makes the distinction of \\"Áâô\\" and \\"ÈΩø\\" in terms of manner of articulation as seen above) Huang adopted a scientific model of categorization and analysis. He also outlined and gave examples of how these ancient sounds have developed into contemporary phonetics. He termed them as \\"original sound\\" (Êú¨Â£∞) and \\"changed sound\\" (ÂèòÂ£∞). This was very significant to the history of Chinese linguistics in that Xiaoxue was starting to be transformed from the study of ancient Chinese lexicography or literature to the discipline of linguistics as we know it today. Although this was a widely accepted theory, scholars like Lin Yutang and Qi Peirong openly disagreed with Huang. Lin Yutang, in his publication \\"The consonants that have disappeared from ancient phonology\\" (Âè§Èü≥‰∏≠Â∑≤ÁªèÈÅóÂ§±ÁöÑÂ£∞ÊØç), pointed out Huang's failure to incorporate analyses of vowels in his theory and that his line of logic constitutes a circular, thus erroneous argument. Lin also cast doubt on the field's standard on categorization in general. Despite his political progressiveness, Huang Kan was amongst the classicist scholars in Republican China, which employed \\"rigorous historicism\\" as method of analysis in philology giving great attention to old texts and data. Classicist scholars gave very little credit to individual authorship. Instead, they emphasized on building a legacy of \\"empirical accuracy\\" in fragments and factual details. Therefore, many classicist projects in philology could be seen as \\"collective enterprises by scholarly lineages that spanned several generations\\". Disciples and children of scholars usually finished what their ancestors started. Many major conclusions are often not credited to the individual but upheld by one's entire lineage. Huang Kan, in this case, as the student of Zhang Taiyan, came from a prestigious line of scholarship along with other students of Zhang. Together, they practically dominated the field of phonology then. The marginalized scholars including Wang Li and Zhang Shilu, practiced a comparative and historical approach in phonology and their disciples continued as rivals till recent days. Huang famously said, \\"I shall only write books when I reach fifty years old\\" (‚ÄúÂπ¥‰∫îÂçÅÔºåÂΩìËëó‰π¶‚Äù). Unfortunately, Huang passed away right around the age of fifty so the majority of his works were only published after his passing. A compilation of his major works including nineteen of his writings were published as Special Edition of Works by the Late Mr. Huang Jigang „ÄäÈªÑÂ≠£ÂàöÂÖàÁîüÈÅóËëó‰∏ìÂè∑„Äã after his death. Specifically, it included \\"General remarks on Erya (Erya Lue Shuo, Â∞îÈõÖÁï•ËØ¥), which defined and explained the importance of Erya and incorporated his comprehensive summary of past analyses of Erya, including that of Guo Pu (one of the earliest writers on Chinese ancient texts from the first century); \\"General remarks on Shuowen\\" (Shuowen Lue Shuo, ËØ¥ÊñáÁï•ËØ¥), which studied the etymology of Chinese characters and analyzed the rationale of Chinese orthography; \\"General remarks on Shengyun\\" (Shengyun Lue Shuo, Â£∞ÈüµÁï•ËØ¥), which elaborated on the importance of phonetics and the historical change of Chinese phonetics through the multiple versions and editions of Guangyun spread across dynasties. = As an educator = Upon returning to China after his political exile in Japan, Huang slowly withdrew from direct political involvement and focused on research and teaching. He taught at Peking University, National Central University, Jinling University, Shanxi University, and some others for more than twenty years collectively. After the collapse of the imperial Qing, many intellectuals joined the New Culture Movement started by Chen Duxiu, Hu Shih and more (mainly scholars that were educated in western countries) advocating for a new Chinese culture based on democracy and science. Consequently, the leaders of the movement decided to employ the vernacular writing style as one of the trademarks of the movement. Huang Kan, although opposing the imperialist government, did not support the New Culture movement, either. His strong classicist orientation kept him as a vehement \\"cultural traditionalist\\". In 1925, when he was the only professor in the Chinese Department at Wuchang Higher Normal, he refused to teach any classes as a protest to the school's proposal to hire left-wing poet Guo Moruo (a leader of the New Cultural Movement) as a faculty member. Eventually, Guo had to decline the invitation. Furthermore, Huang often poked fun of vernacular writing. During that time period, people communicated via telegram in long distance. He asked his students to imagine a telegram delivering the death of someone's mother. Vernacular Chinese (often disyllabic, having two syllables making up one word) would be \\"Your mama is dead. Come back now!\\" (‚Äú‰Ω†Â¶àÂ¶àÊ≠ª‰∫ÜÔºÅÂø´ÂõûÊù•ÂëÄÔºÅ‚Äú) as opposed to the older form (often monosyllabic where individual syllables make up its own word) (literally) \\"Mother dead. Fast return.\\" (‚ÄúÊØçÊ≠ªÈÄüÂõû„ÄÇ‚Äù) The vernacular Chinese uses more characters to write and therefore, would cost more money to send as a telegram. Huang Kan was a very famous academic during his time for both his uncompromising political stance as well as his teaching style. His lectures were often so popular that the lecture halls were filled with admirers standing by the doors and windows to listen. At Peking University, he taught \\"Study of Poetry and Prose\\" and \\"History of Chinese Literature\\". He was known to have prepared his lectures extremely extensively, often departing from textbook content and structure. He was also said to incorporate other studies and fields into his lectures. Furthermore, for students he thought as particularly talented with great potential, he held extra smaller lectures outside of class time to discuss contemporary matters and literature. As a classicist, he was very adamant about the list of twenty-five books from classic Chinese literature that his students were required to read. Despite his strict pedagogy, all of his students were very grateful for his dedication in teaching as he often transferred knowledge of his personal methods and philosophies in studying. Outside of the classroom, he often spent time drinking and writing poetry with his students as well.  Personal life  In 1903, Huang Kan first married Wang Caiheng (ÁéãÈááËòÖ) by arrangement of their parents. Although Huang went abroad to Japan two years after the marriage, within the fourteen years of their marriage, Wang bore seven children. Only three boys and two girls were still living when Wang passed away in 1916. She unequivocally supported Huang's political stance and teaching career and took care of their children. She was praised as a great partner. However, during the long distance marriage, Huang went to Shanghai in pursuit of Huang Shaolan (ÈªÑÁªçÂÖ∞), who was also a student of Zhang Taiyan. He convinced her to marry him using a fake name. She complied because he could not have gotten married with the same identity twice. She regretted the decision once Huang went back to Beijing and started dating a student of his, Peng (ÂΩ≠, this is only a last name). Huang Shaolan's father then disowned her because of the scandal. Consequently, she suffered greatly from mental illness and eventually hung herself. Zhang Taiyan's wife, Tang Guoli (Ê±§ÂõΩÊ¢®), expressed great sympathy for Huang Shaolan and publicly detested Huang Kan's \\"immoral conduct\\" in her writings. Zhang Taiyan, on the other hand, excused his favourite student for such behavior for \\"any great scholar or artist cannot be perfect.\\" In 1923, Huang Kan married one of his own students Huang Juying(ÈªÑËèäËã±), who graduated from college that year. He allegedly had nine marriages in total. In 1916, when Zhang Taiyan was jailed by Yuan Shikai (a politician who attempted to restore the monarchy after Sun Yet-sen's death), Huang Kan arrived at his teaching position in Peking University. Despite the risk of being jailed and executed, Huang moved into Zhang's house arrest in Beijing to take care of his teacher. His students and peers thought him as someone who had the utmost integrity and dedication to truth and justice. Huang Kan had ten children by different wives. His eight sons were Nianhua (ÂøµÂçé), Nianchu (ÂøµÊ•ö, died very early), Niantian (ÂøµÁî∞), Nianxiang (ÂøµÁ••), Nianci (ÂøµÊÖà), Nianqin (ÂøµÂã§), Nianning (ÂøµÂÆÅ), Nianping (ÂøµÂπ≥). He had two daughters, oldest being Shipan(ÈÄÇÊΩò).

Many kings of Jaffna, such as Cankili I, initially confronted the Portuguese in their attempts at converting the locals to Roman Catholicism, but eventually made peace with them. By 1591, the king of Jaffna Ethirimanna Cinkam was installed by the Portuguese. Although he was nominally a client, he resisted missionary activities and helped the interior Kandyan kingdom in its quest to get military help from South India. Eventually, a usurper named Cankili II resisted Portuguese overlordship only to find himself ousted and hanged by Phillippe de Oliveira in 1619. The subsequent rule by the Portuguese saw the population convert to Roman Catholicism. The population also decreased due to excessive taxation, as most people fled the core areas of the former kingdom.  Initial contact  Portuguese traders reached Sri Lanka in 1505; their initial forays were against the southwestern coastal Kotte kingdom, which enjoyed a lucrative monopoly on the spice trade, which was also of interest to the Portuguese. The Jaffna kingdom came to the attention of Portuguese officials in Colombo for multiple reasons, which included their interference in Roman Catholic missionary activities (which was assumed to be supporting Portuguese interests), the lucrative markets and strategic benefits of Jaffna's Vannimai chieftaincies, and their support of anti-Portuguese factions within the Kotte kingdom, such as the chieftains from Sitawaka. By the late 16th century, Portuguese influence strengthened in the courts of the Kandyan and Kotte kingdoms and some of Jaffna's Vannimai chieftaincies were subdued by these kings. The Jaffna kingdom functioned as a logistical base for the Kandyan kingdom, located in the central highlands without access to any seaports. They gained access to the seaports of Trincomalee and Batticaloa in the east, but the Jaffna peninsula proved more convenient as an entry port for military aid arriving from South India.De Silva, Portuguese Encounters with Sri Lanka and the Maldives, p. 95, 110, 111 & 137 Furthermore, it was feared by the Portuguese that (due to its strategic location) the Jaffna kingdom might become a beachhead for Dutch landings.Abeysinghe, T. Jaffna Under the Portuguese, p. 2 It was king Cankili I who resisted contacts with the Portuguese, and even massacred six to seven hundred Parava Catholics in the island of Mannar. These Catholics had been brought from India to Mannar to take over the lucrative pearl fisheries extending to Puttalam from the Jaffna kings.Kunarasa, K The Jaffna Dynasty, pp. 82‚Äì4.Gnanaprakasar, S. A critical history of Jaffna, pp. 113‚Äì7.  Client state  The first expedition, led by Viceroy Dom Constantino de Bragan√ßa in 1560, failed to subdue the kingdom but captured Mannar Island.Vriddhagirisan, Nayaks of Tanjore, p.80-1,91-2 Although the circumstances are unclear, by 1582 the Jaffna king was paying a tribute to the Portuguese of ten elephants or an equivalent in cash. In 1591, during the second expedition, led by Andr√© Furtado de Mendon√ßa, King Puvirasa Pandaram was killed and his son Ethirimanna Cinkam was installed as the monarch. This arrangement gave the Catholic missionaries freedom of action and monopoly in elephant export to the Portuguese, which the incumbent king, however, resisted. He helped the Kandyan kingdom under kings Vimaladharmasuriya I and Senarat (1604‚Äì35) during the period 1593‚Äì1635 with the intent of securing help from South India to resist the Portuguese. He, however, maintained autonomy of the kingdom without overtly provoking the Portuguese.Abeysinghe, T. Jaffna Under the Portuguese, p.3de Silva, A. History of Sri Lanka, p.166  End of the Kingdom  With the death of Pararasasekaran in 1617, Cankili II, an usurper, took control of the throne after killing the regent nominated by the Ethirimanna Cinkam. Unable to secure Portuguese acceptance of his kingship, Cankili II through Migapulle Arachchi invited military aid from the Thanjavur Nayaks and the Karaiyars, and allowed them to use a base in Neduntivu, hence posing a threat to Portuguese shipping routes through the Palk Strait.De Queyroz, The Temporal and Spiritual Conquest of Ceylon, p. 51 & 468 The Portuguese refers to six attempts made in the years 1620 and 1621. At first, the chief of Karaiyars rose in revolt and offered resistance to the Portuguese, with the help of a large troops of Thanjavur Nayaks. Phillippe de Oliveira is said to have defeated him near Nallur. By June 1619, there were two Portuguese expeditions: a naval expedition that was repulsed led by the Varunakulattan, also known as Khem Nayak, and a land expedition by Phillippe de Oliveira and his army of 5000 was able to defeat Cankili. Cankili, along with every surviving member of the royal family, was captured and taken to Goa, where he was hanged. Jaffna prisoners were beheaded. The remaining captives were asked to become monks or nuns in the holy orders, and as most obliged, their celibacy avoided the production of further claimants to the Jaffna throne. Although the Portuguese attempted to eliminate the Jaffna royal family through celibacy, a number of families of Sri Lankan Tamil origin claim descent from the royal family today.Kunarasa, K The Jaffna Dynasty, p. 115  Portuguese and the Kandyan kingdom  Robert Knox's 1681 map According to the Description of the Isle of Ceylon (Amsterdam 1672) by the Dutch Rev. Phillipus Baldeus, who travelled in Sri Lanka in the 17th century. the Kingdom of Jaffnapattinam consisted of the Jaffna Peninsula, the islands off Jaffna, and the Island of Mannar. But in dealing with the limitations of the kingdom, Queir√≥s, an historian of Portuguese origin, says: which indicated the kings of the kingdom just prior to capitulation to the Portuguese had jurisdiction over an area corresponding to the modern Northern Province of Sri Lanka and parts of the northern half of the eastern province and that the Portuguese claimed these based on their conquest.Tambiah, Laws and customs of Tamils of Jaffna, pp. 62‚Äì3. At the time, the mainland south of Elephant Pass was claimed by the King of Kandy, Senerat; he and his troops were consistently harassing the Portuguese in the Jaffna Peninsula. His wife's two sons, Vijayapala and Kumarasinghe, were also married to princesses from Jaffna. After the fall of Jaffna to the Portuguese, Senarat dispatched a 10,000 strong army to Jaffna under the command of Mudaliyar Attapattu. The Portuguese withdrew and the Kandyan army occupied Jaffna. The Portuguese General Constantino de S√° de Noronha later attacked with reinforcements from Colombo and defeated Mudaliyar Attapattu's army and seized Jaffna. According to Portuguese and Dutch publications, the last battle for Jaffna was fought between the King of Kandyan kingdom and the Portuguese, and the Europeans seized Jaffna from the Kandyan king. Following Portuguese defeat by the Dutch, the Jaffna Mannar islands and most of Jaffna's Vannimai lands had been reincorporated into the Tamil Coylot Wannees Country by the 18th century.  Consequences  Over the next forty years, starting from 1619 until the Dutch capture of Jaffna fort in 1658, there were three rebellions against Portuguese rule. Two were led by Migapulle Arachchi,Sabaratnam, Sri Lankan Tamil Struggle, Chapter 5 during that period, Portuguese destroyed every Hindu temple and the Saraswathy Mahal library in Nallur, the royal repository of all literary output of the kingdom. Due to excessive taxation, population decreased and many people moved to Ramanathapuram in India and the Vanni Districts further south. External commerce was negatively impacted, though elephants, Jaffna's principal export, were traded for saltpetre with various kingdoms in India and sent to Lisbon. Thus, decline in trade made it difficult to pay for essential imports, and such items ceased to be imported. In the words of Fern√£o De Queir√≥s, the principal chronicler of Portuguese colonial exploits in Sri Lanka, the people of Jaffna were \\"reduced to the uttermost misery\\" during the Portuguese colonial era.Abeysinghe, T.

Facts Manchester City Council was being run by the Conservative Party, which was operating a policy of selling council houses to the occupants. A Mr Gibson applied, on a form of the council, for details of his house price and mortgage terms. In February 1971, the Treasurer replied: > The corporation may be prepared to sell the house to you at the purchase > price of ¬£2,725 less 20% = ¬£2,180 (freehold)‚Ä¶ This letter should not be > regarded as a firm offer of a mortgage.

In March 1971, Mr Gibson completed the application form with the exception of the date on which his lease was to end, and returned it to the council. The Labour Party returned to power in Manchester in May, and halted new sales. Mr Gibson was told that he could not complete the purchase. He then sued the council, arguing that a binding contract had already come into force. Judgment=Court of Appeal= In the Court of Appeal, Lord Denning MR held that there was a contract, because one should \\"look at the correspondence as a whole and at the conduct of the parties and see there from whether the parties have come to an agreement on everything that was material\\". Geoffrey Lane LJ dissented, and would have held there was no contract. The council appealed. =House of Lords= The House of Lords unanimously upheld the council's appeal, so Mr Gibson did not get his house. The court held that the council's letter was not an offer, for the letter stated that \\"The Corporation may be prepared to sell the house to you\\" and that \\"If you would like to make formal application to buy your Council house, please complete the enclosed application form and return it to me as soon as possible.\\" As there was never an offer available to be accepted, no contract had been formed and by extension the Council had not been in breach.

Influences During this period, Duhm says that he found inspiration in the works of Nietzsche, Hegel, van Gogh, Rudolf Steiner, Jesus, Laozi, Prentice Mulford, and Teilhard de Chardin; and he spent time in the Aktionsanalytische Organisation (AAO) with Otto Muehl at the Friedrichshof community in Austria, and with Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh in India. Focusing on the question how war and violence can be overcome on a global scale, Duhm became intensively interested in the theories of the Marxist psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich. His contention with and eventual renunciation of Reich led him into a deeper study of Asiatic traditions, such as different meditation practises, Yoga, T'ai chi, and others. Early theory As indicated by the titles of his published work, Duhm was never a purely Marxist economist, but had always been interested in the individual, psychological issues underlying the world‚Äôs problems. For example, Duhm has said that ‚Äúbefore we can solve the ecological and technological problems of the Earth, we must first solve the more basic human issues, like competition, jealousy, and fear that prevent human beings from living and working together in community.‚ÄùDieter Duhm, Toward a New Culture, (1975), Verlag Meiga Duhm wanted to realize his vision of a thoroughly peaceful society and create a model ‚Äì a prototype of a post-capitalistic, peaceful civilisation. This would include the peaceful cohabitation and cooperation with all creatures of nature (including bugs and vermin) and provide alternative types of energy supplies using inexhaustible energy sources rather than exploiting the earth, alternative types of architecture, of nourishment and of medicine, right up to a new understanding of the human world imbedded in a cosmic order. Included in his basic theory was the concept of ‚Äúfree love.‚Äù (Duhm has used the term \\"free love\\" to describe \\"love free of fear.‚Äù) He thus attempted to ‚Äúovertake the communist idea on the left‚Äù by expanding it into the erotic area, and soon became one of the main figures in the so-called ‚Äúemancipation debate‚Äù concerning the connection between political work and personal liberation. Practical application In 1978 Duhm began to put this theory into practise. First he created an interdisciplinary research center with a dozen experts from various fields, called the ‚ÄúBauhuette,‚Äù located in southern Germany. Their goal was to find workable answers to the ecological and technological problems facing the human species at that time. However, within a few years they discovered that if their project had any chance of surviving, they first had to research more deeply into the core human relationship questions that lay hidden under all issues ‚Äì such as competition, greed, and jealousy. So Duhm traveled around Germany, Austria, and Switzerland for a year, finding fifty willing participants who began a social community experiment in 1983 to research the possibilities of dissolving internal group conflicts concerning power, money, sexuality and love; and they spent three years in a remote area of the Black Forest under Duhm‚Äôs guidance. But in 1984 a slanderous campaign in the media began against Duhm and his projects, both in Germany and Switzerland. This increasingly impeded the research work in the Black Forest, and finally disrupted it totally. The group‚Äôs attempt to have the information about them corrected remained unsuccessful, and the community finally had to disband. Tamera So in 1989 Dieter Duhm moved to Lanzarote, together with his life partner, Sabine Lichtenfels, and several friends. For the next six years he dedicated his time to painting and writing, and found the peace and quiet he needed to research and prepare his next project. In 1995, Duhm co- founded the Tamera Peace Research Center in southwestern Portugal together with Sabine Lichtenfels and Rainer Ehrenpreis. It was finally his chance to create a working model that put all his research into action, which he called ‚ÄúThe Political Theory,‚Äù based in part on such concepts as holography, chaos theory, systems theory, and morphogenetic fields. Political theory Duhm‚Äôs political theory contends that the basic building blocks of matter are not atoms, but instead are energy, frequency, and information. Earth with its atmosphere and magnetic field, with its waters and landscapes, with its creatures, biotopes and human societies, is an integral, oscillating and living body that can be healed, just as a human body can be healed if the appropriate ‚Äúmedicine,‚Äù i.e. the appropriate information, is administered, Duhm believes. This healing information, Duhm says, is wanted most at the points where new wars are created daily: in the cohabitation of human beings. In this area far reaching change is necessary. Duhm feels that the peace information needed will emerge from social structures whose ethical basic values of compassion, trust, mutual support and solidarity are no longer being destroyed, but rather are generated and maintained; and Tamera is just one of several places necessary where the conditions for peaceful co-habitation are researched and put into practice. Duhm explains his political theory in two books available in English: Future without War: Theory of Global Healing, and The Sacred Matrix: From the Matrix of Violence to the Matrix of Life; Foundations of a New Civilisation. > Decisive for the success of such peace projects is not how big and strong > they are in comparison to the existing apparatuses but how comprehensive and > complex they are, how many elements of life they are able to combine and to > unite in a positive way. In the field buildings of evolution it is not the > law of the strongest, but the success of the more comprehensive that counts. > No new developments would otherwise have been able to assert themselves had > they not all begun small and inconspicuous.Dieter Duhm, Future without War: > Theory of Global Healing, (2007), Verlag Meiga Healing biotopes Duhm calls these places ‚ÄúHealing Biotopes‚Äù or \\"Peace Research Villages,‚Äù which act somewhat like acupuncture points to foster a new future in the body of Earth. His theory postulates that only a few such centers will be sufficient worldwide to tip over the ‚Äúinformation field‚Äù of violence, for together these few centers will create the microscopically small change needed to have a large effect on the ‚ÄúWhole.‚Äù TerraNova As these ideas became more and more concrete, they and the movement in the world that they represent came to be called \\"Terra Nova,\\" which aims to create the conditions for a global system change for a nonviolent Earth, through activism, education and networking and by spreading perspectives for profoundly nonviolent culture based on trust and cooperation.Terra Nova In 2015, Duhm wrote the book Terra Nova: Global Revolution and the Healing of Love to expound upon and clarify the basic ideas of the movement.Terra Nova book Publications *The Sacred Matrix: From the Matrix of Violence to the Matrix of Life; Foundations of a New Civilization. , 464 pages, 2005.

Maebara Issei, a disillusioned hero of the Meiji Restoration and former samurai of the Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain, planned an attack on Yamaguchi Prefecture officials inspired by the Shinp≈´ren rebellion four days earlier. Maebara's plot was exposed and his supporters in Hagi were soon defeated by the Imperial Japanese Army as he travelled the Ch≈´goku region searching for support. Maebara and the leaders of the rebellion were arrested and executed. The Hagi Rebellion was one of a number of \\"shizoku uprisings\\" which took place in Ky≈´sh≈´ and western Honshu during the early Meiji period. Background In 1868, the Meiji Restoration established the Empire of Japan and overthrew the Tokugawa Shogunate that had ruled Japan as a feudal state since 1600. The new Meiji government enacted policies of modernization and Westernization, including reforms aimed at deconstructing feudalism in Japan such as the abolition of the han system and the Tokugawa class system. Many conservative members of the samurai, the former powerful warrior class, were disgruntled as the reforms saw them lose their privileged social status, eliminating their income, and the establishment of universal military conscription had replaced much of their role in the society. The very rapid modernization and Westernization of Japan was resulting in massive changes to Japanese culture, dress and society, and appeared to many samurai to be a betrayal of the \\"joi \\" (\\"Expel the Barbarian\\") portion of the Sonn≈ç j≈çi justification used to overthrow the former Tokugawa Shogunate. Maebara Issei, one of the heroes of the Meiji restoration and a leader of the Imperial Army at the Battle of Aizu, was among the dissatisfied of the Imperial faction. Maebara was a samurai of the Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain, one of the most powerful domains, which the Imperial revolutionaries had gained crucial support from after brokering the Satch≈ç Alliance through the mediation of Sakamoto Ry≈çma. Maebara had been a pupil of Yoshida Sh≈çin and an early advocate of modernization in Japan, rising to the post of Military Minister in the new Meiji government after the Restoration. However, Maebara eventually resigned due to disagreements with Kido Takayoshi over the treatment of the former daimy≈ç after the abolition of the han system. Maebara returned to the former Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain, now part of the Meiji Yamaguchi Prefecture. Revolt On 24 October 1876, Maebara was contacted by the leaders of the Shinp≈´ren Rebellion in Kumamoto to join forces in a widespread uprising against the Meiji government in Kyushu and southwestern Honshu. The Shinp≈´ren Rebellion was defeated the following morning, but managed to inflict surprisingly large casualties on the Imperial Japanese Army and officials of Kumamoto Prefecture. Sympathizers of the rebellion were inspired to instigate their own rebellions against the Meiji government despite the little chance of success. On 26 October 1876, Maebara gathered a group of like-minded samurai in Hagi, the former capital of Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain, and proposed a lightning strike against the Meiji government offices located in Yamaguchi, the capital of Yamaguchi Prefecture. As his forces numbered only around 100 warriors, it was decided to make a night attack, with the date set at 28 October. However, the Governor of Yamaguchi Prefecture was informed of Maebara's preparation and sent word to him with news of the crushed Shinp≈´ren Rebellion, and urged that he stand down. Maebara realized that his plans for a surprise attack were doomed to fail, and that the government offices in Yamaguchi had been reinforced with Imperial troops, so he changed his strategy. Instead, Maebara decided to march along the coast of the Sea of Japan to the national capital Tokyo, winning over the ex-samurai from the various former domains along the way, and to commit mass seppuku (ritual suicide at the feet of Emperor Meiji. Maebara's rebels marched from Hagi to Susa, looting along the way. They recruited more warriors in Susa and began to call themselves the Juntoku Army. Maebara's plans to travel by sea to Hamada in Iwami Province were defeated by strong winds, and he returned to Hagi rather than proceed further. Maebara discovered upon his return to Hagi that someone had dumped his secret store of ammunition into the ocean, rendering his army largely weaponless. On 5 November, Maebara attempted to escape from Hagi with a handful of men in an attempt to reach Tokyo, but he was captured and the remainder of the Juntoku Army was crushed by army troops at Hagi. Maebara and six of his associates were tried before a military tribunal in Fukuoka Prefecture, and were executed on December 3 alongside leaders of the Akizuki Rebellion, another Shinpuren-inspired rebellion that began in Akizuki on 27 October. Forty of the surviving rebels received prison sentences.

It is held annually at the beginning of November. About 200 teams of up to five players each compete. The duration of the game is between 17 and 20 hours, traditionally beginning on Friday at dusk and closing by Saturday noon. The game has a simple scheme‚Äîa linear sequence of an a priori unknown number of secret sites (usually about 15). The place and time of the beginning of the game is announced in advance. Here the teams can solve the first puzzle. The solution of the puzzle found at each site reveals the position of next site. The final task usually tests the cooperation within the team. The first team that solves all puzzles and the final task becomes the winner and is rewarded by immense fame and recognition in the community and a symbolic prize (official T-shirts). Most years no more than 5 teams finish the game with some years having no winner at all. The puzzles are very diverse, the only common feature is that they require logical thinking. The players may face simple substitution and transposition ciphers, steganography, graphic and multimedia ciphers, object with a clue hidden inside that must be destroyed, and more. As the years go and numerous experienced teams return to the game many times, the puzzles, especially those later through the game, tend to depart from the traditional schemes and feature very original principles and lines of thought, devised just for the occasion. The advance through the game is hardened by the early November night conditions; players must be able to remain fully focused regardless of sleepiness, dark, cold, and low mood. Starting at about one third of the way the game leaves the urban area meaning there is no more place to hide indoors in case of rain or snow. No hints are given to the solutions upon request so a team can easily find itself stuck at a site for several hours. For emergency cases there is a game-leaving envelope containing instructions how to get to safety. The players are encouraged to cooperate within a team but inter-team collaboration is forbidden. The players can move by walk and by the means of public transportation, but use of any other means including taxi, own cars, even bicycle or in-lines, is not allowed. Teams can use any available map and compass (but not GPS) for navigation and cell phones (but not radio stations) for communication.

The Shinp≈´ren, a radical organization of former samurai of the Kumamoto Domain, were extremely opposed to the Westernization of Japan and loss of their class privileges after the Meiji Restoration. The Shinp≈´ren under the leadership of Otaguro Tomoo launched a surprise attack against the Imperial Japanese Army and Meiji government in Kumamoto, killing dozens of soldiers and Kumamoto Prefecture officials. The Shinp≈´ren were defeated by the army the following morning, with most surviving rebels killing themselves by committing seppuku or arrested and executed by Meiji authorities. The Shinp≈´ren rebellion was one of a number of \\"shizoku uprisings\\" which took place in Ky≈´sh≈´ and western Honshu during the early Meiji period.Yubin hochi shinbun No. 1127 (Series 20). A contemporary account. Description in English. Background Painting depicting the Imperial Japanese Army's repression of the Shinp≈´ren rebellion. In 1868, the Meiji Restoration established the Empire of Japan during the Bakumatsu, and overthrew the Tokugawa Shogunate that had ruled Japan as a feudal state since 1600. The new Meiji government enacted policies of modernization and Westernization, including reforms aimed at deconstructing feudalism in Japan such as the abolition of the han system and the Tokugawa class system. Many conservative members of the samurai, the former powerful warrior class, were disgruntled with the direction the nation had taken. The Meiji reforms saw them lose their privileged social status under the feudal order, also eliminating their income, and the establishment of universal military conscription had replaced much of their role in the society. The very rapid modernization and Westernization of Japan was resulting in massive changes to Japanese culture, dress and society, and appeared to many samurai to be a betrayal of the \\"joi \\" (\\"Expel the Barbarian\\") portion of the Sonn≈ç j≈çi justification used to overthrow the former Tokugawa shogunate. The Shinp≈´ren was an extremist and xenophobic secret society of ex-samurai of the Kumamoto Domain in Higo Province led by Otaguro Tomoo, which grew out of the teachings of Hayashi ≈åen. The island of Ky≈´sh≈´ was historically the main location of trade with the West, but also a stronghold of conservative anti-Meiji sentiment. Shinp≈´ren members did not want to simply halt the Westernization process, they wanted to turn the clock back and eradicate every trace of it, including the wearing of Western clothes, use of the Gregorian calendar, and even the use of Western weapons. Members carried salt with them at all times for use in ritual purification of polluting foreign influences, such as electricity, railroads, and even Buddhist priests. They were incensed by Meiji government decrees permitting foreigners to purchase land in Japan, to allow missionaries to spread the Christian religion, and to forbid the carrying of swords. A rumor that Emperor Meiji was planning a trip overseas was the final straw for Shinp≈´ren members. Uprising Governor of Kumamoto Prefecture, was assassinated during the Shinp≈´ren rebellion. Otaguro was also a Shinto priest (kannushi), and after several attempts at divination, was given what he considered to be divine authorization to lead an uprising. As the Meiji government had called upon the Imperial Japanese Army garrison at Kumamoto to suppress the nearby Saga Rebellion, the city itself was only lightly defended. On 24 October 1876, after sending messages to like-minded groups in other domains, Otaguro led his 200 men in revolt against the Meiji government, dividing his force into squads. One squad launched a surprise night attack on the barracks of the Imperial Japanese Army's Kumamoto garrison, giving no quarter and showing no mercy even to the wounded or unarmed, spurred on by their hatred of the conscript army, many of whose soldiers were from peasant backgrounds. Some 300 men of the garrison were either slaughtered or wounded during the attack. A second squad smashed the local telegraph office, although this in effect cut the rebels off from their would-be allies. A third squad attacked the offices and residences of officials of Kumamoto Prefecture, the new Meiji administrative division that had replaced Higo Province. The Shinp≈´ren successfully assassinated Yasuoka Ryosuke, the governor of Kumamoto Prefecture, Major General Taneda Masaaki, the commander of the Kumamoto garrison, and Taneda's Chief of Staff. However, the tide of the rebellion turned against the rebels once the garrison's remaining Army officers overcame their surprise at the attack. Officers managed to organize their troops, and the Army's superior numbers and firepower soon decimated the rebels, armed only with traditional swords. Otaguro, badly wounded in the fighting, asked for one of his followers to cut off his head as part of a death ritual. After his death, many of his followers followed by committing seppuku. The uprising was over by the following morning, but a state of emergency remained in effect in Kumamoto until November 3. The graves of some 123 members of the Shinp≈´ren are located in the grounds of Sakurayama Shrine in Kumamoto. Many of those who fell were in their teens or early twenties. Aftermath Approximately 124 of the 200 Shinp≈´ren rebels died during the uprising, either killed in action or from suicide, and most of the remainder were wounded. Surviving rebels were arrested by the Japanese authorities and some were subsequently executed by beheading. Approximately 60 Imperial Japanese Army soldiers and Kumamoto Prefecture officials were killed by the rebels and over 200 were wounded. At the time, the Shinp≈´ren rebellion had a ripple effect in western Japan, spawning the Akizuki Rebellion and the Hagi Rebellion only days later. Although the rebellion failed completely, the fact that a small but determined band of men could create such a state of panic, and could defeat such a large force, proved to be an inspiration to anti-Meiji political secret societies until the end of the Empire of Japan in 1945. The Shinp≈´ren rebellion is sometimes considered to be precursors to the major Satsuma Rebellion which occurred from January to September 1877. Yukio Mishima's Runaway Horses, the second book of the Sea of Fertility series, covers the Shinp≈´ren Rebellion in detail.

Serving on several ships, Berkeley saw action at all three Battles of Ushant, commanded fleets in the West Indies and off Ireland and governed the supply routes to Portugal and Spain which kept Wellington's armies in the field during the Peninsula War. He also enjoyed an extensive political career, reforming military practices in Britain and participating in several prominent scandals including feuds with Charles James Fox and Hugh Palliser. Early career George Cranfield Berkeley was born in 1753, the third son of Augustus Berkeley, 4th Earl of Berkeley and his courtier wife Elizabeth Drax. His father died when George was only two and the title Earl of Berkeley passed to his elder brother Frederick. George was privately educated until nine, when he attended Eton College, gaining a formal education until 1766 when he was attached to the royal yacht Mary commanded by a relative Augustus Keppel. Mary conveyed Princess Caroline Matilda to Denmark, where she was married to Christian VII of Denmark. Berkeley acted as page at her wedding. In 1767, Berkeley was attached to the squadron under Hugh Palliser based at Newfoundland. Berkeley was there mentored by Joseph Gilbert (who later accompanied James Cook) and John Cartwright (later a prominent political reformer). With these men, Berkeley participated in a survey of Newfoundland, learning seamanship, surveying and numerous other skills in the two-year commission. In 1769, Berkeley was transferred to the Mediterranean and served in the frigate HMS Alarm under John Jervis. For the next five years, Berkeley spent time in the Mediterranean and at home, making lieutenant in 1772 but failing to be elected as MP for Cricklade and then Gloucestershire after a bitter and enormously expensive contest. American Revolutionary War Following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Berkeley served on HMS Victory, in which he commanded a gundeck at the First Battle of Ushant. Berkeley became a prominent opponent of Sir Hugh Palliser after the battle, at which Palliser was accused of refusing to obey the orders of his commanding officer, Admiral Augustus Keppel. This opposition did not prevent Berkeley gaining his first independent command the same year, when he took over the 8-gun HMS Pluto. The next year he moved to the similarly tiny HMS Firebrand and impressed his commanding officer Lord Shuldham. Shuldham's recommendation for promotion was turned down however due to his previous involvement in the Palliser affair. In 1780, Berkeley was appointed to HMS Fairy, a 14-gun brig under his cousin George Keppel and together they captured the American ship Mercury, taking prisoner Henry Laurens who was on a secret mission to loan money from the Dutch government. The information procured from Laurens led to a British declaration of war against the Netherlands. As another consequence, Berkeley was promoted to captain by Admiral Richard Edwards and commanded Fairy during the relief of the Great Siege of Gibraltar and further operations against American shipping from Newfoundland. In 1781, Berkeley was given command of the frigate HMS Recovery which was placed in the squadron of Samuel Barrington. At the Second Battle of Ushant in 1782, Berkeley's ship was engaged in the decimation of a French convoy and its escorts. As a reward, Berkeley was given the captured ship of the line HMS Pegase. Whilst aboard her he was approached by a young William Cobbett who wanted to volunteer for the navy. Berkeley dissuaded Cobbett, who later credited Berkeley with saving him from \\"most toilsome and perilous profession in the world\\". In April 1783, Berkeley finally gained a seat in parliament, at the constituency of Gloucestershire. Berkeley would remain MP for the town for the next 27 years and took the position seriously, becoming a very important independent MP. He even attempted to bring William Pitt the Younger and Charles James Fox into an alliance, although the collapse of the scheme ended with a feud between him and Fox. Emilia Charlotte Lennox (John Hoppner) The following year, 1784 after the peace, Berkeley married Emilia Charlotte Lennox, daughter of Lord George Lennox. The marriage was a love match and Berkeley's sister commented that they were \\"a pattern of domestic happiness scarcely to be equaled\\". The couple had three daughters and two sons and remained an unusually tight-knit family, Berkeley using his extensive personal wealth to bring his family with him on long voyages and overseas postings. In 1786 Berkeley commanded HMS Magnificent and remained with her for three years until 1789 when he became surveyor- general of the ordnance. He left the post after the French Revolutionary Wars broke out in 1793, taking over HMS Marlborough. French Revolutionary Wars Berkeley was still in command of Marlborough when she fought under Lord Howe at the Glorious First of June, fighting as part of Admiral Thomas Pasley's van division there and at the preceding Atlantic campaign of May 1794. At the First of June, Marlborough was dismasted in close combat with several French ships and Berkeley badly wounded in the head and thigh, having to retire below after a period to staunch the bleeding. He had a long convalescence after the action but was amongst the captains selected for the gold medal commemorating the action, only awarded to those felt to have played a significant part in the victory. Returning to service in 1795, Berkeley commanded HMS Formidable off Brest, Cadiz, Ireland and the Texel, coming ashore in 1798 to command the Sussex sea fencibles. In 1799, Berkeley was promoted rear-admiral and attached to the Channel Fleet, but the gout which had forced his first retirement returned, and Berkeley was forced to take permanent shore leave in 1800. In 1801, Berkeley increased his political interests to compensate for the loss of his naval career. Napoleonic Wars Berkeley continued building his political status during the Peace of Amiens and by Berkeley had been appointed inspector of sea fencibles, a job he undertook with vigour, conducting a fourteen-month survey of Britain's coastal defences, which greatly improved the island's defences. In 1806, after a shift in political power, Berkeley fell out of favour somewhat and was dispatched to the North American Station. From there, Berkeley ordered the attack by HMS Leopard on the American frigate USS Chesapeake in retaliation for American recruitment of British deserters. This action, known as the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, helped precipitate the War of 1812. Having embarrassed the British government with this action, Berkeley was recalled home. However, public opinion supported his orders, so Berkeley was moved to command in Lisbon in the hope he could organise the chaotic supply system for Wellington's army in the Peninsula War. Berkeley recognised that only a dedicated and organised convoy system could keep the supply of men, food and material regular and consequently set one up. Simultaneously, he reequipped and galvanised the remnants of the Spanish Navy, rescuing several ships from capture by the French as well as used frigates to supply partisan units all along the coast of Portugal and Northern Spain. By 1810, Wellington could truthfully say of Berkeley that \\"His activity is unbounded, the whole range of the business of the Country in which he is stationed, civil, military, political, commercial, even ecclesiastical I believe as well as naval are objects of his attention\\". He was promoted to full admiral and made Lord High Admiral of the Portuguese Navy by the Portuguese Regent in Brazil. Berkeley retired from the post in 1812, again laid low by health. He and Wellington remained good friends for the rest of their lives, and Wellington later stated that Berkeley was the best naval commander he had ever cooperated with. Berkeley's final voyage was to return to Britain aboard HMS Barfleur. Later rewards included being made a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1813 which was converted to a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1815. He was reportedly disappointed not to have been given a peerage for his long and excellent service. Retirement and family Berkeley retired to a house in South Audley Street, London, where his gout continued to plague him with severe pain for the rest of his life. He spent some time during this period conversing with lifelong friend Edward Jenner, whose vaccine for smallpox Berkeley had persuaded the government to investigate, particularly with regard for the health of the navy.

Bertie won recognition for unsuccessfully defending his ship against superior odds in the American Revolutionary War. He was later criticised however for failing to close with the enemy at the Glorious First of June and later for pulling rank on a subordinate officer just days before the capture of the French island of Mauritius and taking credit for the victory. Despite these controversies, Bertie was rewarded for his service with a baronetcy and the Order of the Bath, retiring in 1813 to his country estate at Donnington, Berkshire. American Revolutionary War Albemarle Bertie was born in 1755, the natural son of Peregrine Bertie, 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven, and much of his childhood is undocumented. It is not even clear when he entered the Navy, although he was gazetted lieutenant in December 1777 aged 22, quite a bit older than most of his contemporaries. Within a year of promotion, Bertie had witnessed combat on the repeating frigate at the First Battle of Ushant, a brief and inconclusive action which resulted in a court martial for Admiral Hugh Palliser, a court martial at which Commander Bertie (as he by then was), was called on to give evidence in 1779. The intervening two years had been highly eventful, Bertie spending most of it as a prisoner of war in France after Fox had been taken by the larger French on 11 September 1778. Following his exchange and appearance as a witness, Bertie spent two years without a ship, due to the shortage of available positions for young officers during the American Revolutionary War. On 21 March 1782,Marshall (1823), pp.195‚Äì198 after a change of government, Bertie was reinstated and made captain of the 24-gun frigate stationed in the Channel, serving in her until June. He remained on half-pay throughout the 1780s, marrying Emma Heywood of Maristow House in Devon on 1 July 1783, and having four children: Lyndsey James, Catherine Brownlow, Emma and Louisa Frances. His wife Emma predeceased him, dying in March 1805. He briefly commanded the frigate between October and December 1787. French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars In 1790 at the Spanish armament, Bertie gained command of the frigate before progressing to captain of a ship of the line, in 1792, in which he assisted at the capture of the French privateer Le G√©n√©ral Dumourier, and her prize St. Iago, having on board more than two million dollars, besides valuable cargo worth between two and three hundred thousand pounds. The following year he took command of in Lord Howe's Channel Fleet. With Thunderer and Howe, Bertie participated in the Atlantic campaign of May 1794 and the culminating Glorious First of June. Howe omitted Bertie from his dispatches of the battle and Bertie was not awarded a commemorative medal like many of the other captains. His failure to close with the French fleet was later cited against him. For the next ten years Bertie remained with the Channel Fleet on uneventful blockade duty, serving under Sir John Borlase Warren and commanding Thunderer, , and on this duty. On 23 April 1804, Bertie was promoted to rear-admiral, climbing the ranks over the next three years until he was senior enough to become admiral in charge of the Cape of Good Hope Station off South Africa, being promoted to vice-admiral on 28 April 1808. He served off South Africa for the next two years, suddenly sailing in late 1810 to take over the operations to invade Mauritius and seize it from the French. Most of the fighting had already been concluded by Admiral William O'Bryen Drury before Bertie's arrival and Drury was furious at Bertie's behaviour, writing several strong letters to the Admiralty in protest. Bertie returned to Britain in 1811 and endured a brief political storm over his actions at Mauritius, which had been criticised by his fellow senior officer on the island, Lord Minto. Angered, Bertie requested court martial to defend his conduct but was firmly refused by the Admiralty, which did not wish for another scandal. A change of government the following year changed the political situation however and Bertie was returned to favour and presented with a baronetcy on 8 December 1812 as reward for the capture of Mauritius, Drury having died in the meantime. Retirement Retiring to his country estate at Donnington in Berkshire, Bertie continued to be promoted post- retirement, becoming a full admiral on 4 June 1814. He was also made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on the restructuring of the orders of knighthood, on 2 January 1815. He died in 1824 after ten years' retirement, and his title was inherited by his only son Sir Lyndsey James Bertie, 2nd Bt., then a lieutenant in the 12th Regiment of Dragoons. Although sources do explicitly state that his son succeeded to the Baronetcy, Lieutenant Bertie appears to have died at Waterloo in July 1815, and is not mentioned in the will of Admiral Bertie, drafted in August 1815. ;Notes ;Bibliography * * - Category:1755 births Category:1824 deaths Category:Royal Navy admirals Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the Bath Category:Royal Navy personnel of the American Revolutionary War Category:Royal Navy personnel of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:British naval commanders of the Napoleonic Wars ","title":"Sir Albemarle Bertie, 1st Baronet"},{"id":"15115154","text":"Gmina Babiak is a rural gmina (administrative district) in Ko≈Ço County, Greater Poland Voivodeship, in west-central Poland.

These rules only address the location and manipulation of the strings of the language. It does not describe anything else about a language, such as its semantics (i.e. what the strings mean). (See also formal grammar). Formal language A formal language is an organized set of symbols the essential feature being that it can be precisely defined in terms of just the shapes and locations of those symbols. Such a language can be defined, then, without any reference to any meanings of any of its expressions; it can exist before any interpretation is assigned to it‚Äîthat is, before it has any meaning. A formal grammar determines which symbols and sets of symbols are formulas in a formal language.  Formal systems  A formal system (also called a logical calculus, or a logical system) consists of a formal language together with a deductive apparatus (also called a deductive system). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of transformation rules (also called inference rules) or a set of axioms, or have both. A formal system is used to derive one expression from one or more other expressions. Propositional and predicate calculi are examples of formal systems.  Propositional and predicate logic  The formation rules of a propositional calculus may, for instance, take a form such that; * if we take Œ¶ to be a propositional formula we can also take Œ¶ to be a formula; * if we take Œ¶ and Œ® to be a propositional formulas we can also take (Œ¶ Œ®), (Œ¶ Œ®), (Œ¶ Œ®) and (Œ¶ Œ®) to also be formulas. A predicate calculus will usually include all the same rules as a propositional calculus, with the addition of quantifiers such that if we take Œ¶ to be a formula of propositional logic and Œ± as a variable then we can take (Œ±)Œ¶ and (Œ±)Œ¶ each to be formulas of our predicate calculus.

The overall population of the district is about 1800 students, faculty, administrators, and other workers. History The first actual school building was made in 1804, which was a log building. Fairview's first teacher was John Linn. A real school was built in 1810, specifically as a school, along U.S. Route 20. During the mid-20th century, a two-story structure called the Union School replaced three other smaller buildings and housed all the children from the borough area. This school was burned and then rebuilt in 1891. In 1895, this building became the first in Erie County to offer an upper level system. By 1909, a complete 4 year high school education was available to the students of Fairview. A new school was built was 1905, called South High. South High offered grades 1-9. One-room buildings outside Fairview had been replaced by larger brick buildings in the 4 quadrants of Fairview. In 1927, a new joint high school had been approved with help by the Lake Shore B, built on Chestnut Street. This new school incorporated Fairview Students as well as Girard Students. When this school was built, this is when Fairview first started to achieve in extracurricular activities. It created its first football team in 1927, and in 1935, a gym was added to the school. The music program was created in 1940, and the marching band soon followed in 1941. Eventually, an elementary wing would be added onto the Chestnut School. In 1958, a new elementary school was built, and it still included Girard Students. The Manchester Elementary School was modern, but had to accommodate Girard students as well. Eventually, Girard built its own school, and soon, the Chestnut School was made into a total elementary school. Renovations and additions would be made to the elementary schools throughout the 1960s and 1970s. For a short duration during the 1960s, Northwestern students were brought into the Fairview School District, but quickly went their own way. In 1968, Fairview and Girard were about to merge into a single school, but in 1970, the state decided to keep the school districts separate. Fairview High School was built in 1973, and the Garwood building was converted into a middle school. Manchester building was eventually sold. In 1996, a new elementary school was built next to the Middle School. In 2002-2003, Garwood Middle School went under extreme renovations, and was completely renewed. Eventually, in 2004, Garwood changed its name to Fairview Middle School. =Fairview High School= Fairview High School is a high school located in Fairview Township, Pennsylvania.

Life Hunnius went rapidly through the preparatory schools of W√ºrttemberg, and studied from 1565 to 1574 at T√ºbingen. In 1576 Jacob Heerbrand recommended him as professor to the University of Marburg, where Hunnius exerted himself to do away with all compromises and restore Lutheran orthodoxy. He gained many adherents, and the consequence was a split in the State Church of Hesse which finally led to the separation of Upper and Lower Hesse. The cardinal point of all controversies was the doctrine of ubiquity which Hunnius maintained in his writing De persona Christi. Bartholom√§us Meier, one of Landgrave William's theologians, replied, but could not prevail against Hunnius' learned eloquence. In 1592 Hunnius removed to Wittenberg. In the electorate of Saxony, Calvinism had made great headway under the elector Christian, but his successor, Duke Frederick William, desired to introduce Lutheran orthodoxy, and for this purpose called the Swabian theologians, among them Hunnius, to Wittenberg. Immediately after his arrival he was made member of a committee on visitation, instituted for the purpose of purifying the country from Calvinism (see: Saxon Visitation Articles). For the same purpose he was called into other German territories, as, for instance, into Silesia by Duke Frederick of Liegnitz. Hunnius was the most able representative of the Swabian theology of Johannes Brenz, and consequently of the doctrine concerning the majesty and omnipresence of Christ as man. But he advanced the Lutheran cause also in reference to other doctrines, and his influence is traceable in the development of Lutheran dogmatics after his time. The later doctrine concerning the authority of Holy Scripture is based upon Hunnius' Tractatus de maiestate, fide, autoritate et certitudine sacrae scripturae. In the same way he established the orthodox Lutheran doctrine of predestination by following John of Damascus in his distinction between voluntas antecedens and consequens, and considering faith as the instrumental cause of election. Bibliography The literary activity of Hunnius was mainly polemical. His most important works are: *De persona Christi (1585), which is an enlargement of an earlier treatise entitled Bekenntnis von der Person Christi (1577) *Tractatus de maiestate, fide, autoritate et certitudine sacrae scripturae (1588) *Calvinus iudaizans, sive Judaicae glossae et corruptelae in explicandis testimoniis Scripturae Sacrae de trinitate, etc. (1593) *Anti-Parens (1594) *Anti-Parens alter (1599) He wrote also numerous dogmatic monographs and commentaries on the Gospels of Matthew and John, the Epistles of Paul, and the first Epistle of John. He composed several Biblical dramas in Latin, among them Josephus, comaedia sacra, which was presented at Strasburg in 1597. A complete edition of his Latin writings was edited by his son in-law, H. Garthius (5 vols., Wittenberg, 1607‚Äì09).

Many mannerisms and cultural aspects were associated with wine. It led to great change in Ancient Greece as well. The ancient Greeks pioneered new methods of viticulture and wine production that they shared with early winemaking communities in what are now France, Italy, Austria and Russia, as well as others, through trade and colonization. Along the way, they markedly influenced the ancient European winemaking cultures of the Celts, Etruscans, Scythians and ultimately the Romans.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pp. 326‚Äì329 Oxford University Press 2006 Origins A golden goblet from the Mycenaean period. Viticulture has existed in Greece since the late Neolithic period, with domestic cultivation becoming widespread by the early Bronze Age. Through trade with ancient Egypt, the Minoan civilization on Crete was introduced to Egyptian winemaking methods, an influence most likely imparted to Mycenaean Greece. The Minoan palaces had their associated vineyards, as Spyridon Marinatos demonstrated in excavations just south of the palace site at Archanes, and the Minoan equivalent of a villa rustica devoted to wine production was unearthed at Kato Zakros in 1961.Noted in Karl Kerenyi, Dionysos: Archetypal image of indestructible life 1976:56 notes 15, 16. In Minoan culture of the mid-second millennium BC, wine and the sacred bull were linked in the form of the horn-shaped drinking cups called rhyta; the name of Oinops (Greek: , \\"wine-colored\\"). is twice attested in Linear BThe attested Mycenaean Greek Linear B forms of the word are , wo- no-qo-so, and , wo-no-qo-so-qe, found respectively, on the KN Ch 1015 and KN Ch 897 tablets. tablets at KnossosMichael Ventris and John Chadwick, Documents in Mycenaean Greek 1959:130 and repeated twice in Homer.Iliad XIII.703; Odyssey XIII.32 (\\"his brace of wine-dark oxen\\") Along with olives and grain, grapes were an important agricultural crop vital to sustenance and community development; the ancient Greek calendar followed the course of the vintner's year. One of the earliest known wine presses was discovered in Palekastro in Crete, from which island the Mycenaeans are believed to have spread viticulture to others in the Aegean Sea and quite possibly to mainland Greece.R. Phillips A Short History of Wine, pp. 29‚Äì34 Harper Collins 2000 In the Mycenaean period, wine took on greater cultural, religious and economic importance. Records inscribed on tablets in Linear B include details of wine, vineyards and wine merchants, as well as an early allusion to Dionysus, the Greek god of wine. Greeks embedded the arrival of winemaking culture in the mythologies of Dionysus and the cultural hero Aristaeus.Wine also plays a leading role in the myths of Ikarios/Semachos, who welcomed the god and his gift, and of Amphitryon, who taught the civilized technique of mixing wine and water, the lack of which aroused the centaurs and resulted in the conflict of Lapiths and centaurs. Early remnants of amphoras show that the Mycenaeans actively traded wine throughout the ancient world in places such as Cyprus, Egypt, Palestine, Sicily and southern Italy. Colonization and trade The Vix Krater As the Greek city-states established colonies throughout the Mediterranean, the settlers brought grapevines with them and were active in cultivating the wild vines they encountered. Sicily and southern Italy formed some of the earliest colonies, as they were areas already home to an abundance of grapevines. The Greeks called the southern part of the Italian Peninsula Oenotria (\\"land of vines\\"). Settlements in Massalia in southern France and along the shores of the Black Sea soon followed, with the expectation that not only would colonial wine production supply domestic needs, but also create trading opportunities to meet the demand of the nearby city-states. Athens itself provided a large and lucrative market for wine, with significant vineyard estates forming in the Attican region and on the island of Thasos to help satisfy demand. Wine historians have theorized that the Greeks may have introduced viticulture to Spain and Portugal, but competing theories suggest that the Phoenicians probably reached those areas first. The grape clusters, vines and wine cups that adorn Greek coins from classical times bear witness to the importance of wine to the ancient Greek economy. With every major trading partner, from the Crimea, Egypt, Scythia, Etruria and beyond, the Greeks traded their knowledge of viticulture and winemaking, as well the fruits of their own production. Millions of amphora pieces bearing the unique seals of various city-states and Aegean islands have been uncovered by archaeologists, demonstrating the scope of Greek influence. A shipwreck discovered off the coast of southern France included nearly 10,000 amphoras containing nearly of Greek wine, presumably destined for trade up the Rh√¥ne and Sa√¥ne rivers into Gaul. It is estimated that the Greeks shipped nearly 10 million liters of wine into Gaul each year through Massalia. In 1929, the discovery of the Vix Grave in Burgundy included several artifacts demonstrating the strong ties between Greek wine traders and local Celtic villagers. The most notable of these was a large Greek-made krater, designed to hold over of wine. Viticulture and winemaking influences A terra cotta relief showing Satyrs expressing the juice from trodden grapes in wicker mats in the tropeion. Ancient Greeks called the cultivated vine hemeris (Greek: ·º°ŒºŒµœÅŒØœÇ), after their adjective for \\"tame\\" (Greek: ·º•ŒºŒµœÅŒøœÇ), differentiating it from its wild form. A massive rootstock was carved into a cult image of the Great Goddess and set up on the coast of Phrygia by the Argonauts.Argonautica I.1116-39. The late Dionysiaca of Nonnus recounts the primitive invention of wine-pressing, credited to Dionysus, and Homer's description of the Shield of Achilles describes that part of its wrought decoration illustrating the grape harvest from a vineyard protectively surrounded by a trench and a fence; the vines stand in rows supported on stakes. He also wrote that Laertes, father of Odysseus, had over 50 grape varieties planted in different parts of his vineyard. The 4th-century BC Greek writer Theophrastus left a detailed record of some Greek influences and innovations in viticulture, one of which was the study of vineyard soils and their proper match to specific grapevines. Another innovation was the minimization of yields for more intense concentration of flavors and quality, rather than increased quantity. The economics of the time favored high yields for most crops, and intentionally limiting agricultural output was exceedingly uncommon in the ancient world. Theophrastus also detailed the practice of using suckering and plant cuttings for new vineyard plantings. The Greeks also employed vine training with stacked plants for easier cultivation and harvesting, rather than let the grapevines grow untrained in bushes or up trees. While ampelographers have been unable to identify the exact ancestry of any current Vitis vinifera grape variety among those grown by the ancient Greeks, several‚Äîe.g. Aglianico (also known as Helleniko), Grechetto, and Trebbiano (also known as Greco)‚Äîhave distinct Greek heritage. Not all Greek viticulture techniques were widely adopted by other wine regions. Some Greek vineyards used mysticism to ward off disease and bad weather. For example, two vineyard workers would tear a live white rooster in two, each then carrying one half around the perimeter of the vineyard in an opposite direction from the other. Where they met again, the carcass would be buried next to the vineyard. The Greeks practiced an early form of pigeage when grapes were ready for crushing. Wicker baskets filled with grapes were placed inside wooden or earthenware vats with a rope or plank above. Vineyard workers grasped the rope for balance to crush the grapes with their feet, occasionally to the accompaniment of a flute played in a festive manner. After crushing, the grapes were placed in large pithoi, jars where fermentation took place. Both Hesiod's writings and Homer's Odyssey include some of the earliest mentions of straw wine production: laying out freshly harvested grapes on mats to dry nearly to raisins before pressing. A wine made on Lesbos known as protropon was among the first known to be made exclusively from \\"free-run juice,\\" drawn from grape clusters expressing their contents under their own weight. Other Greek innovations include the harvest of deliberately unripe grapes in producing a more acidic wine for blending. The boiling of grape must was discovered as another means of adding sweetness to the wine. The Greeks believed wine could also be improved by adding resin, herbs, spice, seawater, brine, oil and perfume. Retsina, mulled wine and vermouth are some modern examples of these practices. As late as the Second Council of Constantinople in 691 AD, exactly three centuries after Theodosius closed the temples, a canon was issued expressly forbidding the cries of \\"Dionysus!\\" from the wine treaders, who still were masked;In representations of Antiquity, the wine- treaders are invariably satyrs and sileni,: \\"they were indeed the wine- treaders in disguise,\\" Kerenyi observes; in medieval images peasants tread the grapes, their shifts tucked into their belts. it was recommended that \\"Kyrie eleison\\" be substituted.Noted in Kerenyi 1976:67 and notes. Greek wine In ancient times, the reputation of a wine depended on the region the wine came from rather than an individual producer or vineyard. In the 4th century BC, the most expensive wine sold in the local agora in Athens was that from Chios, which sold for between a quarter of a drachma and 2 drachma for a chous worth‚Äîabout the equivalent of four standard 750 ml wine bottles today. Like early wine critics, Greek poets would extol the virtues of certain wines and review less favorably those not up to their standards. The wines most frequently cited as being of good quality were those of Chalkidike, Ismaros, Khios, Kos, Lesbos, Mende, Naxos, Peparethos (present-day Skopelos) and Thasos. Among individual wines lauded were two with unknown origins: Bibline and Pramnian. Bibline is believed to have been made in a style similar to the Phoenician wine from Byblos, highly regarded for its perfumed fragrance by Greek writers like Archestratus. The Greek version of the wine is thought to have originated in Thrace from a grape variety known as Bibline. Pramnian wine was found in several regions, most notably Lesbos but also Icaria and Smyrna (in present-day Turkey). It was suggested by Athenaeus that Pramnian was a generic name referring to a dark wine of good quality and aging potential. The earliest reference to a named wine is from the lyrical poet Alkman (7th century BC), who praises \\"D√©nthis,\\" a wine from the western foothills of Mount Taygetus in Messenia, as \\"anthosm√≠as\\" (\\"smelling of flowers\\"). According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, Limnio was almost certainly the Lemnia grape described by Aristotle as a speciality of the island of Limnos,J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 225 Mitchell Beazley 1986 which was probably the same as the modern-day Lemni√≥ varietal, a red wine with a bouquet of oregano and thyme. If so, this makes Lemni√≥ the oldest known varietal still in cultivation. kylix drinking cup was used to serve Greek wine. The most common style of wine in ancient Greece was sweet and aromatic, though drier wines were also produced. Color ranged from dark, inky black to tawny to nearly clear. Oxidation was difficult to control, a common wine fault that meant many wines did not retain their quality beyond the next vintage. However, wines that were stored well and aged were highly prized: Hermippus described the best mature wines as having a bouquet of \\"violets, roses and hyacinth.\\" Comedic poets noted that Greek women liked \\"old wine but young men.\\" Wine was almost always diluted, usually with water (or snow when the wine was to be served cold). The Greeks believed that only barbarians drank unmixed or undiluted wine and that the Spartan king Cleomenes I was once driven insane after drinking wine this way. They also believed that undiluted wine could even kill the drinker: the Gallic chieftain Brennus was recorded as having committed suicide by drinking wine full-strength.Pausanias, Guide for Greece 10.19.4-23.9 Greeks asserted that the dilution of wine with water was a mark of civilized behavior, whose contrast was embodied in the myth of the battle of Lapiths with the Centaurs, inflamed to rape and mayhem because of wine drunk undiluted with water. Wine in Greece was never far from its mystical connection to the cult of Dionysus: Attic black-figure kylix, ca 530 BC, depicting Dionysus aboard the vine-entangled ship among his would-be abductors transformed to dolphins. Wine in Greek culture In addition to its significance as a trade commodity, wine also served important religious, social and medical purposes in Greek society. The \\"feast of the wine\\" (me-tu- wo ne-wo) was a festival in Mycenaean Greece celebrating the \\"month of the new wine.\\"Mycenaean and Late Cycladic Religion and Religious Architecture , Dartmouth CollegeT.G. Palaima, The Last days of Pylos Polity , Universit√© de Li√®geJames C. Wright, The Mycenaean feast, American School of Classical Studies, 2004, on Google books The cult of Dionysus was very active, if not mysterious, and was immortalized in Euripides's play The Bacchae. Several festivals were held throughout the year in honor of the God of wine. February's Anthesteria marked the opening of the wine jars from the previous autumn harvest, featuring wine-drinking contests and a procession through Athens carrying wine jars. The Dionysia included theatrical performances of both comedies and tragedies in honor of the God of wine. Wine was a frequent component at the symposium, which sometimes included the game of kottabos, which involved flinging lees from a wine cup towards a target. The medicinal use of wine was frequently studied by the Greeks, including Hippocrates, who did extensive research on the topic. He used wine as a cure for fevers, to ease convalescence and as an antiseptic. He also studied the effect of wine on his patients' stool. Various types of wine were prescribed by Greek doctors for use as an analgesic, diuretic, tonic and digestive aid. The Greeks were also aware of some negative health effects, especially those arising from the consumption of wine beyond moderation. Athenaeus made frequent mention of wine's ability to induce hangover and suggested various remedies for it. The poet Eubulus noted that three bowls (kylikes) were the ideal amount of wine to consume. The quantity of three bowls to represent moderation is a recurring theme throughout Greek writing (today, the standard 750 ml bottle contains roughly three to six glasses of wine, depending on serving size). In his c. 375 BC play Semele or Dionysus, Eubulus has Dionysus say: See also *Ancient Greek cuisine *Ancient Rome and wine *Phoenicians and wine *Wine-dark sea (Homer) ReferencesExternal links *Greek wine history Greek winemakers *All about Greek wine History Wine Ancient Greece and wine Ancient Greece and wine Category:Greek wine Category:History of wine Wine ","title":"Ancient Greece and wine"},{"id":"15115771","text":"Gmina Wierzbinek is a rural gmina (administrative district) in Konin County, Greater Poland Voivodeship, in west-central Poland.

B√∂ttcherstra√üe is a street in the historic centre of Bremen, Germany. Only about 100 m (330 ft) long, it is famous for its unusual architecture and ranks among the city's main cultural landmarks and visitor attractions. Most of its buildings were erected between 1922 and 1931, primarily as a result of the initiative of Ludwig Roselius, a Bremen-based coffee-trader, who charged Bernhard Hoetger with the artistic supervision over the project. The street and its buildings are a rare example of an architectural ensemble belonging to a variant of the expressionist style. Several of the houses can be classed as Brick Expressionism. Since 1973, the ensemble has been protected by the Monument Protection Act.  Overview  Lichtbringer (detail) View from the Paula Modersohn-Becker Haus towards Haus St. Petrus Haus des Glockenspiels Robinson-Crusoe-Haus and Haus Atlantis (Martinistra√üe) Roselius, a sympathiser of National Socialism, pursued V√∂lkisch-Nordic cultural ideas influenced by the ideologists Julius Langbehn and Herman Wirth, involving a belief in the irreplaceable value of the Nordic race. He aimed to have these ideas materialise in B√∂ttcherstra√üe. Roselius stated \\"The re-erection of B√∂ttcherstra√üe is an attempt to think in a German way\\" ‚Äì \\"I want, and that is the deepest aim of what was created in B√∂ttcherstra√üe, to break the spell of the banishment the ill-informed Romans sentenced our people to, which still weighs upon us...\\" Although Roselius and Hoetger paid tribute to Hitler as the \\"Bringer of Light\\" on a relief at the entrance, the F√ºhrer rejected this variant of v√∂lkisch art in a Reichsparteitag speech on 10 September 1936, in which he dismissively referred to B√∂ttcherstra√üenkunst (\\"B√∂ttcherstra√üe art\\").Kristina Hoge (inaugural dissertation), Self-portraits in the face of the threat of Nazism, in German, \\"We have nothing to do with those elements that only know National Socialism from hearsay and thus easily confuse it with undefinable nordic phrases, seeking out some mythical Atlantic culture to find their motifs. National Socialism rejects that kind of B√∂ttecherstra√üe art most sharply\\". (Hitler) The NSDAP dressed B√∂ttcherstra√üe down as reflecting a \\"divergent view of culture\\", and while the street was listed as an architectural monument on 7 May 1937, it was listed as an \\"example of the degenerate art of the Weimar period\\". Roselius tried to become a member of the NSDAP twice but his application was rejected twice due to his 'degenerate art' and independence that the Nazis found disconcerting.Puschner, Uwe, and Clemens Vollnhals. Die voelkisch-religioese im Nationalismus. Goettingen: Vandenhoek & Ruprecht, 2012. In October 1936 Ludwig Roselius injected more capital into Focke-Wulf aircraft company thereby increasing his shareholding to 46% and regular board meetings were held in the Boettcherstrasse. Sosthenes Behn, chief of ITT secured 27.8%, and Hitler was outfoxed.Volker Bergmann, Dieter Pfliegensdoerfer; Project group: Willi Elmers, Manfred Fittkau, Wolfgang Guenther, Michael Jung, Michael Wolf. Wellblech & Windkanal. Arbeit und Geschaefte im Bremer Flugzeugbau von den Anfaengen 1909 bis heute. Steintor, 1989  History  The history of B√∂ttcherstra√üe goes back to the Middle Ages. It constituted an important link between the market square and the Weser river. It was traditionally inhabited by coopers (Northern ). When the harbour was relocated in the mid-19th century, B√∂ttcherstra√üe's importance began to fade. In 1902 (some sources say 1906), Ludwig Roselius, under pressure from the previous owners, bought the house at 6 B√∂ttcherstra√üe (today's Ludwig Roselius Museum) and made it the headquarters of his company, which would later produce the HAG coffee brand. He bought other lots in the street in the years thereafter. In the years after World War I, further offices, the HAG- Haus, the Haus St. Petrus, and the House of the Seven Lazy Brothers were constructed. The houses were built of typical materials of the time: brick and sandstone. In contrast to these buildings, in 1926, Ludwig Roselius had the Paula Modersohn-Becker-Haus built to serve as a museum dedicated to the painter Paula Modersohn-Becker. The building's external walls have relief-like decorations, and its internal rooms follow principles of organic architecture. In 1931 the Atlantis House (Haus Atlantis) was completed. Its distinctive style and materials (glass, steel, and concrete) produced a further striking contrast to the other structures. The Robinson Crusoe House (Robinson-Crusoe Haus) was also erected in 1931. In early 1934 Ludwig Roselius, Otto Wagener and Hitler had a meeting with Hitler criticizing Roselius for allowing his architect Bernhard Hoetger free rein regarding the expressionist architecture in the B√∂ttcherstrasse whereby Roselius had to defend Hoetger and then change the subject to a more general discussion of architecture.Irving, D. Hitler's War. Hodder & Stoughton 1977. In 1944, large proportions of B√∂ttcherstra√üe were destroyed by aerial bombing. By 1954, the Kaffee HAG company had restored most of the facades to their original state. In 1979, Ludwig Roselius Jr. sold the Kaffee HAG company, along with B√∂ttcherstra√üe, to General Foods. Two years later, he bought B√∂ttcherstra√üe back. Since then, it has been privately owned. Significant damage to the building fabric became apparent in 1989. The Sparkasse Bremen bank bought the whole street and all its buildings, except Haus Atlantis. Restoration was completed by 1999. In 2004 ownership passed to a foundation (Stiftung Bremer Sparer Dank). It is now administrated by B√∂ttcherstra√üe GmbH, a limited company and subsidiary of Sparkasse Bremen.  Present  Today, B√∂ttcherstra√üe is one of the major tourist attractions of Bremen. It contains several art museums (Museen B√∂ttcherstra√üe), Arts and crafts workshops, bars, restaurants, shops and a hotel. Nearly all buildings and plots are owned by the foundation. A major attraction is the carillon of Meissen porcelain bells at the Glockenspiel House which chimes three times a day.  Bibliography  * Ludwig Leidig: Bombshell.

Until 2002, the AI of a programme was calculated by the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB), the organisation that compiles television ratings for the major broadcasters and advertisers in the UK. Currently the AI is produced as part of an online Television Appreciation Survey, on behalf of the BBC Audience Research Unit, by GfK NOP. As the individual ratings that produce the AI of a programme are recorded online the day after broadcast, the resulting score is usually available two days after broadcast, though these scores are not generally made public by the BBC. The AI is considered especially useful for assessing the level of appreciation by viewers for programmes made for small or specialist audiences. If a television programme has performed only passably in the ratings, yet achieves a high AI, it can help to determine whether the programme should be recommissioned. On average, programmes aired on the BBC's four main television channels (BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Three and BBC Four) for the period April‚ÄìJune 2013 received an AI rating of 82.3 and radio programmes received an AI rating of 79.9. The average AI for a drama programme on UK television channels BBC One and ITV1 was reported, in 2009, to be 84. Programmes with specialist appeal will often score higher ratings. Internal guidance to BBC production staff is that an AI of 85 or over is to be considered excellent, over 90 is exceptional, 60 or less is poor, and less than 55 is very poor. Sometimes a programme will not garner an AI, as the response for that programme may have been too small. Nor is the AI a conclusive measure; while it is valuable for comparisons within a particular programme category, comparisons between the AIs of different programme types (e.g. dramas with quiz shows) carry no weight. AI scores in the 90s are less common, though this is less the case for niche, targeted programming that attracts a limited number of viewers, such US imports on smaller channels (such as Sky1), or for specialist programmes, or some very popular dramas. The highest recorded score until the end of 2009 was 97 for a US import on Sky1. Scores lower than 30 are very rare, though some party political broadcasts have received AI scores in the 20s. One criticism of the more general value of AI scores is that audiences tend to watch those shows they like, or expect to like, and so will tend to score them well. History In 1936, the BBC began conducting surveys of its radio and television audiences. The intention was not to count the number of listeners or viewers, but to gauge opinion on the programmes themselves. The BBC used volunteers, who kept diaries of their listening and viewing habits, submitting them to the corporation periodically. From these, the first Appreciation Indexes were calculated and privately made known to the programme-makers. A flaw in the method became apparent when programmes with low audience numbers were left with a small, yet loyal, core of fans. These would give the programme an inflated AI. When commercial television launched in Britain in 1955, advertisers were less concerned about attitudes to programmes than they were about viewing figures, and this marked the start of the frequent measurement of audience totals. With the establishment of commercial television, individual broadcasters began to gather their own ratings data, as well as viewer opinion in the form of the AI, until 1981, when the major industry players set up the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB) to compile this information. In 2002, BARB ceased to compile AI data; currently the BBC commissions its own research. Method Under BARB, viewing diaries were sent to 2,000 people on a panel made up of members of the public each week, with a further four panels consisting of 1,000 people each receiving diaries every four weeks. Since 2005 the panel has been recruited and administered online by GfK NOP, for the BBC Audience Research Unit as a daily survey called Pulse, a panel of around 20,000 people (16+) who are invited to complete a survey every day to say what they have watched and listened to, and what they thought of each programme. Pulse measures a wide range of BBC and competitor stations. The daily reporting panel is weighted for age, social grade, sex, presence of children, region and the household digital type on a daily basis to ensure it is representative of the UK as a whole. The main Pulse measure, the AI or Appreciation Index, is obtained by respondents being asked to mark out of 10 each of the programmes they watched or listened to the previous day, where 10 is the highest score and 1 the lowest. The average of all these marks out of 10 for a programme is then multiplied by 10 to give an Appreciation score (AI). For example, when aggregating scores for all programmes together for BBC TV (as of March 2011), the average score is 8.2, which gives an AI of 82. The panel enables the BBC to collect over 5,000 responses a day on TV and radio programmes. Panelists are encouraged, by means of a prize draw reward scheme, to log in at least ten times in any one month. At this time only a limited number of TV channels are covered by this rating system, and only broadcasts watched live, or in recorded form the same day, are given AI scores. More extensive surveys, covering more channels and including programmes recorded for viewing within a week of broadcast, are occasionally carried out by smaller panels. Additional measures include ratings for the quality and distinctiveness of the programmes. There are a selection of other questions that form part of the survey ‚Äì some that are always asked, and some that may be asked depending on the programme. An example of the former is to note how much of each programme was watched, using a scale of 1‚Äì10, where '10' means that the viewer watched it all, and '1' means that they watched very little. Also of key importance to the BBC is to find out whether the viewers considered a programme to be of 'high quality'. An example of the latter would be a question designed to gauge whether the viewer 'learned something new'. Viewers are also asked to rate how much effort they took to view the programme‚Äîwhether they made a special effort, just some effort, or watched it because it was on. An extensive study undertaken by the BBC into how people score programmes and what variables help to make up an AI score found that one of the leading factors in determining an AI score was whether a programme was deemed to be \\"high quality\\". Other factors such as the amount of effort people take to view the programme or whether viewers found it entertaining were also important. The study found that scores can be affected in different ways for different types of programme. The score for a sport programme can depend on which team a panellist supports and who won or lost. Scores for a programme can vary according to how long a show has been running, so a new comedy will typically start with a lower average score and then increase over time as viewers become accustomed to the characters and settings. The study found that changes in the TV market, such as the expanded choice offered by digital TV, the introduction of HD and the increased use of PVRs and catch up services such as BBC iPlayer, have helped to increase the quality of the TV watching experience, and this in turn has improved average AI scores. People typically give programmes they have recorded, or have viewed in HD, a higher score than the same programme watched live or in standard definition. BBC HD has a higher average AI (85 ‚Äì as of March 2011) than any other BBC channel.

It is funded by the Belgian federal Ministry of public health and assessed in collaboration with Belgian industry. The initiative lead to the specification of about 20 specific XML messages (the Kind Messages for Electronic Healthcare Records - Belgian implementation standard or KMEHR-bis). Structure The KMEHR standard consists of an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) message format defined by the KMEHR XML Schema, a set of reference tables and a set of recognized medical transactions compliant with this grammar. =Message structure= A KMEHR XML message is composed of two components: a header and at least one folder. The header of the message describes the sender, the recipient(s) and a few technical statuses. The folder itself gathers the information about a patient, where each folder identifies the subject of care (patient) and contains at least one medical transaction. The medical transaction item gathers the information reported by one healthcare professional at a given instance. Its attributes are type, author, date and time. Summarized Electronic Health Record Summarized Electronic Health Record (SumEHR) is a KMEHR message, used for the exchange of medical information. It summarizes the minimal set of data that a physician needs in order to understand the medical status of the patient in a few minutes and to ensure the continuity of care. The SumEHR standard was introduced by the Belgian government in 2005 and an EMD software package used by a physician (GP) should be capable of exporting a SumEHR message (KMEHR message level 4) for any given patient. =Coding= The KMEHR-bis standard comprises a set of dictionaries which define the transaction types, heading types, item types, severity levels and administration routes. Object linkage The KMEHR-bis standard supports links to either internal or external objects, e.g. an image or another KMEHR-message. =Services= The KMEHR-Bis specification is extended with web services (based on SOAP), which define request and response elements to offer standard web services.

It operates Boeing C-17 Globemaster III aircraft supporting the United States Air Force global reach mission worldwide. Mission statement Provide services and support, which promote quality of life and project global power through combat-proven airlift. History=Origins= Prior to the early 1930s, transport aircraft in the Air Corps had been assigned to air depots and to service squadrons, although provisional transport squadrons had been formed for special projects. By 1932 Major Hugh J. Knerr, Chief of the Field Service Section of the Materiel Division, proposed the formation of a transport squadron at each air depot to act as a cadre for the transport wing the Air Corps proposed to support a field army in the event of mobilization. Major General Benjamin Foulois approved the formation of four provisional squadrons in November 1932.Maurer, Aviation in the U.S. Army, pp. 367‚Äì368 The 4th Provisional Transport Squadron was constituted on 1 October 1933 and allotted to the Fifth Corps Area. It was organized with reserve personnel by March 1934 at Bowman Field, Kentucky as a Regular Army Inactive unit.ClayRegular Army Inactive units were units that were constituted in the regular army. Although they were not activated, they were organized with reserve personnel during the 1920s and early 1930s. Even though they had reserve personnel assigned, they were not Organized Reserve units. Because they had no regular personnel they were still considered inactive in the regular army. Clay, p. vi In the spring of 1935, the provisional transport squadrons, including the 4th Transport Squadron at Rockwell Field, California, were activated with Bellanca C-27 Airbus aircraft assigned. The reserve officers of the unit were reassigned. With enlisted men as pilots, the squadron hauled engines, parts, and other equipment to airfields in the Rockwell Air Depot area, returned items to the depot, and transferred materiel between depots. It also furnished transportation for maneuvers. The rapid transport of supplies by the squadrons permitted the Air Corps to maintain low levels of materiel at its airfields, relying on replenishment from depot stocks only when needed. In May 1937, the squadron was reassigned from the Rockwell Air Depot to the newly activated 10th Transport Group, which assumed command of all four active transport squadrons. The squadron received two-engine Douglas C-33s, the military version of the DC-2 in 1936 and Douglas C-39s (DC-2s with tail surfaces of the DC-3) in 1939 to replace the single engine Bellancas. These, and various other militarized DC-3s remained as the squadron's equipment until the entry of the United States into World War II. In 1938 when Rockwell Field was transferred to the United States Navy, the Rockwell Depot moved to Sacramento, California and the squadron continued its transport mission from McClellan Field. =World War II= After the Pearl Harbor Attack, the squadron was transferred to the 62d Transport Group and re-equipped with Douglas C-47 Skytrain transports. Initially transferred to Kellogg Field, Michigan for training, the squadron trained for combat resupply and casualty evacuation mission at several airfields during the spring and summer of 1942. Was ordered deployed to England, initially as part of Eighth Air Force in September 1942. It performed intratheater transport flights of personnel, supply and equipment within England during summer and fall of 1942. The squadron was reassigned to Twelfth Air Force after Operation Torch invasion of North Africa, initially stationed at Tafaraoui Airfield, Algeria. In combat, performed resupply and evacuation missions across Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia during North African Campaign. During June 1943, the unit began training with gliders in preparation for Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily. It towed gliders to Syracuse, Sicily and dropped paratroopers at Catania during the operation. After moving to Sicily, the squadron airdropped supplies to escaped prisoners of war in Northern Italy in October. I operated from Sicily until December until moving to Italian mainland. The squadron supported the Italian Campaign during balance of 1944 supporting partisans in the Balkans. Its unarmed aircraft flew at night over uncharted territory, landing at small unprepared airfields to provide guns, ammunition, clothing, medical supplies, gasoline, and mail to the partisans. It even carried jeeps and mules as cargo. On return trips it evacuated wounded partisans, evadees and escaped prisoners. During the spring of 1944, the squadron was transferred to Tenth Air Force in India where it carried combat cargo during the Siege of Myitkyina, Burma. Returning to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations in July 1944, it carried paratroopers during Operation Dragoon the invasion of Southern France in August 1944. The squadron then returned to operations over Italy and in the Balkans until end of combat in Europe, May 1945. In all the 4th earned nine campaign streamers during operations in both the European and China-Burma-India theaters in the Second World War. The squadron was inactivated at the end of 1945 =Korean War= The squadron was reactivated September 1946, being assigned to the troop carrier squadron training school at Bergstrom Field, Texas. When the school closed in July 1947, it moved to McChord Field, Washington where its parent 62d Troop Carrier Wing became the host unit at the airfield. It conducted routine peacetime transport operations, training with Army units at Fort Lewis with simulated combat parachute training drops flying Curtiss C-46 Commandos and the new Fairchild C-82 Packet combat cargo aircraft, designed to operate from forward, rugged airfields. With the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, the squadron deployed to Japan in December 1950 where it was attached to various Far East Air Forces (FEAF) units for the next year. The squadron was re-equipped with Douglas C-54 Skymaster 4-engine cargo aircraft where it flew combat resupply missions over the Korean peninsula, supporting United Nations ground forces with resupply and casualty evacuation flights from rough airfields to and from FEAF Japanese air bases. It also conducted trans-pacific aerial transportation from the United States. The squadron returned to McChord in November 1951. =Cold War= With its return from Korea, the squadron re-equipped with the new Douglas C-124 Globemaster II strategic airlifter. It moved to nearby Larson Air Force Base when McChord was taken over by Air Defense Command in 1952. From Larson, the squadron airlifted troops, blood plasma, aircraft parts, ammunition, medical supplies, and much more, primarily to Japan, in support of the Korean War until the armistice in June 1953. During the balance of the 1950s, the squadron supported the French forces in French Indochina, transporting a replacement French garrison to Dien Bien Phu in 1954. Operation Bali Hai saw the Globemasters fly around the world in a period of 8 to 10 days. The C-124s departed the desert of Moses Lake for Germany and France, where French troops were onloaded for a flight through Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Thailand, and, finally, Vietnam, where the French joined their comrades in Indochina. By 1955 the Cold War was well under way, and North American Air Defense Command set out to build a chain of radar stations on the northernmost reaches of the continent. This chain of radars, known as the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW Line), was to detect incoming Soviet missiles and bombers, and give our forces enough warning to launch a counterattack, and get the National Command Authorities to safety. Between 1955 and 1957, the squadron began to fly missions to the Alaskan arctic regions, carrying 13 million pounds of supplies and equipment to build the DEW Line. The resupply of the DEW Line stations kept the Wing occupied until 1969. =Vietnam War= In a realignment of assets, on 1 June 1960, the squadron's parent 62d Troop Carrier Wing moved back to McChord in June 1960. During the early 1960s, the squadron found itself back in Indochina by April 1962. At a time when overt American participation in the war in Vietnam was minimized, the squadron began carrying Army supplies and equipment from Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, to Saigon, South Vietnam. The next month, the squadron participated in Operation Spare Bed, airlifting an Army field hospital to a classified location in Thailand. During the 1960s the aircraft of the squadron found themselves almost continually supporting United States military missions in South Vietnam as the growing American commitment required more troops, supplies and equipment. The squadron was upgraded to the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter intercontinental jet transport in 1966 flying troops and supplies regularly to Tan Son Nhut, Cam Ranh Bay and Da Nang Air Bases in South Vietnam, as well as to Clark Air Base in the Philippines and Don Muang Airport in Thailand, among others. With the ending of the United States involvement in the Vietnam War in the early 1970s, the squadron flew missions in support of Operation Homecoming, the return of our prisoners of war from Vietnam in early 1973. Missions were flown to Hanoi, North Vietnam to pick up the POWs and transport them to Clark Air Base. Subsequently, they were flown back to the United States, to return to their waiting families. In March 1975, with the fall of South Vietnam imminent, the squadron returned to Saigon one last time during Operation Babylift, which carried hundreds of Vietnamese orphans to the United States, where adoptive parents awaited their arrival. =Global airlift= During the 1970s, the squadron returned to a peacetime status, with routine flights around the world carrying personnel, equipment and supplies as needed. This was interrupted in 1978 following the mass murder-suicide of more than 900 people at the Jonestown religious compound in Guyana, South America. The squadron airlifted bodies to a morgue at Dover Air Force Base (most of the victims were U.S. citizens). Crew members reported using their oxygen masks during the flight, in an effort to stifle the stench of decaying bodies in the cargo compartment. In 1980, the squadron began to exchange its C-141A Starlifters for newer, \\"stretched\\" C-141B models. This new version of the aircraft increased its cargo carrying capacity by inserting two fuselage plugs, one forward, one aft of the wings, totaling just over 23 feet in length. Also of note in the B series, an air refueling receptacle, lending yet longer range to the C-141. Beginning in June 1983, the squadron took full advantage of the longer, air- refuelable C-141B to carry out the perilous mid-winter (June is the beginning of winter in the Southern Hemisphere) airdrop over Antarctica. Air refueling made possible the trip from Christchurch, New Zealand, to the South Pole and back. In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, on the shores of the Persian Gulf. Within days the squadron began flying missions to the Middle East as part of Operation Desert Shield, the effort to deter further aggression from Iraq. The operations tempo was unprecedented. By January 1991, Desert Shield became Desert Storm, as allied air power was unleashed upon the invaders. The squadron joined the rest of Military Airlift Command in providing round-the- clock airlift to the Middle East, keeping the air war supplied, and aiding the buildup of ground forces for the highly successful, though brief, ground war in February. Before long, Kuwait was free, although the effort put forth by the squadron had accelerated the aging process of its C-141s. The increased payloads and almost incessant flying would have lasting negative effects on the fleet. In early 1992, squadron crews and aircraft began participating in Operation Provide Hope, helping to deliver hundreds of tons of food and medicine to the former Soviet Union. By August, Operation Provide Relief (later known as Operation Restore Hope), rushing food supplies to the starving people of Somalia, the relief of victims of Hurricane Andrew in our own country, and relief efforts for the Guamanian victims of Typhoon Omar kept its crews and aircraft on the move. In late 1995, President Bill Clinton ordered the deployment of 20,000 U.S. troops to the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia, as part of a multinational peacekeeping force. Squadron aircraft deployed to Rhein-Main Air Base, Germany, by 18 December, ready to do their part. In spite of severe weather conditions, crews and aircraft were soon flying troops and equipment into Taszar Air Base, Hungary, for Operation Joint Endeavor. In January 1996 the squadron, operating under a provisional wing located at Rhein-Main Air Base Germany, continued supporting airlift missions into Tuzla and Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzogovina. and Taszar in support of Operation Joint Endeavor. In April 1996, the squadron provided equipment and personnel transportation in support of an Air Expeditionary Force in the middle eastern Kingdom of Jordan as part of Operation Southern Watch. On the night of 15 May 1996, aircrews took part in Big Drop III, the largest airdrop since World War II. The squadron helped deploy members of the Army 82d Airborne Division, U.K. 5th Airborne Brigade personnel, and their heavy equipment onto three drop zones on Fort Bragg, North Carolina. A humanitarian mission included the deliverance of relief supplies from Kadena Air Base, Japan to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam after Typhoon Linda devastated the area in early November 1997. The typhoon unleashed torrential rains and winds that wiped out coastal villages, killed hundreds of people and left thousands homeless. In 2000, the squadron retired its C-141 Starlifters for the new McDonnell Douglas C-17 Globemaster III airlifter. In a response to the terrorist attacks against America on 11 September 2001, President George W. Bush initiated war against terrorism named Operation Infinite Justice, later renamed Operation Enduring Freedom. The squadron supported these efforts by airlifting troops and supplies destined for Afghanistan. It also flew humanitarian airdrops that hundreds of thousands of the rations for starving Afghans. Flights in support of Coalition efforts in Afghanistan continue to the present day.McChord Air Museum, 2000 to 2010 In January 2003 additional personnel and aircraft deployed to locations all around the world in support airlift operations. By the end of January all aircraft supporting this effort would fly their missions from Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina, the only East Coast C-17 Base. Similar C-17 stage operations had been operating into Afghanistan from a base in Germany. After repeated noncompliance with UN demands Operation Iraqi Freedom began. \\"On my orders, coalition forces have begun striking selected targets of military importance to undermine Saddam Hussein's ability to wage war,\\" President Bush stated in an address to the nation. During the war squadron personnel would be in the thick of the fight. Under the cover of darkness at a forward operating location at Aviano Air Base, Italy on 26 March 2003, squadron aircraft flew into the hostile skies of Northern Iraq. The nine-hour mission, covering distance roughly the equivalent of Seattle to St. Louis, delivered members of the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade into an area north of Baghdad. This mission, the largest combat airdrop since the invasion of Panama in December 1989 in Operation Just Cause, was the first combat insertion of paratroopers using C-17s. Operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom continued until the United States withdraw from Iraq at the end of 2011.

Early metalwork John Leland visited Birmingham in about 1538, and found many smiths manufacturing knives and nails among other products. By 1683, there were 202 forges in the town (mainly in the Digbeth and Deritend areas), and guns and brass goods were also being made. Metal was not made to any great extent in the town itself at this stage, but was mainly imported from Staffordshire and elsewhere in the West Midlands. Immigration to the city from the surrounding counties brought expansion of these industries. The population of the city increased from 5-7,000 in 1700 to nearly 24,000 in 1750, and by 1775 the population was about 40,000, making Birmingham the third largest town in the UK after London and Bristol. In 1791, Arthur Young described Birmingham as \\"the first manufacturing town in the world\\". Manufacturing By 1759, a House of Commons committee heard that at least 20,000 people in Birmingham and the surrounding area were employed in the \\"toy trade\\", manufacturing buttons, buckles and other trinkets, with the trade being worth around ¬£600,000 per annum (five-sixths of it for export). Matthew Boulton, in 1770, claimed that Birmingham's superiority as a manufacturing town was largely due to the \\"superactivity\\" of the people, and the \\"mechanical contrivances and extensive apparatus which we are possess'd of\\". The use of hand-operated machinery and division of labour (which might see a button pass through fifty hands in the course of manufacture) was commented on by many visitors to Birmingham. Children were often employed in this sort of labour, their work being made easier by machines. In 1767, there were 35 gun-makers, and 27 manufacturers of other gun parts. The firm of Farmer and Galton supplied most of the weaponry to the Company of Merchants in Africa (i.e. the African slave trade). Pins, jewellery and papier-m√¢ch√© were also produced in large quantities in the city, and goods of all sorts were exported to North America and Europe (Boulton, in the same year, claimed that half his correspondence was in German). Birmingham Canal Galton Bridge and the modern Galton Tunnel The first cargo was transported on the Birmingham Canal in 1770, and the canal greatly reduced the price of goods such as coal which had previously been transported by road. The canal system was extended throughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Banks Expansion during this period was also aided by the establishment of several banks ‚Äì the button manufacturer John Taylor and the ironmaster Sampson Lloyd III established what was later to become Lloyds Bank (and then Lloyds TSB) in 1765, opening a branch in London in 1770. Despite the establishment of several large manufacturers (for example Boulton and Fothergill's famous works at Soho), most of the city's manufacturing was done in small family workshops. Payment was usually by piece-work, and workers could therefore decide when they wanted to work ‚Äì it was usual for \\"Saint Monday\\" to be a day of rest in addition to the weekend, with long hours being worked later on to compensate, and employers had very little control over the working hours of their employees. Aside from banks, there were other kinds of institution involved in the circulation of money in Birmingham before the modern era. For example, the Brewers Investment Corporation Ltd, with offices at Nos.3-4, County Chambers, Corporation Street, Birmingham. Midlands Pubs ‚Äì Bradford Street It became a public company by 1895 and was listed on the London Stock Exchange for that year. Stock Exchange Official Yearbook (1895) Water power Sarehole Mill As early as 1755, Sarehole Mill was leased by Matthew Boulton, one of the pioneers of the Industrial Revolution and leading figure of the Lunar Society, for scientific experimentation. It is believed he converted the machinery for use in metal working. As well as milling grain it has been used for grinding bones for fertiliser, sheet metal rolling (Matthew Boulton) and wire drawing. Steam power The long-established industrial processes in the city meant that it was actually quite late in adopting the methods of the Industrial Revolution ‚Äì manufacturing was so efficient and workshops so small that the steam engine, developed in Birmingham by Boulton and James Watt around 1770, did not find widespread use in the city for another sixty years (in 1815, there were only about forty steam engines in the town, many very small). However, steam power and improvements in iron manufacturing processes were important in the development of the nearby Black Country, which by the end of the 18th century supplied much of the metal needed by Birmingham's manufacturing industries. Invention Numerous inventors emerged during Birmingham's past, and the city's skilled workforce and infrastructure encouraged other inventors and businessmen from across the world to set up shop in the city.

The regiment spent 1862‚Äì1864 in the Department of the Gulf and finished the war with the Army of the Shenandoah. During its service, it survived a hurricane off the Carolinas en route the Gulf of Mexico, manned the forts guarding the Mississippi Delta, invaded Texas at the Rio Grande and along the coast, fought in Banks' ill-fated Red River Campaign in Louisiana, manned Washington DC defenses, and provided rear-area security for the Shenandoah Valley campaign in 1864 south of Harpers Ferry. Service=1861= The 13th was raised at large, and organized at Augusta, Maine, and mustered into Federal service for a three-year enlistment on December 13, 1861. Unlike earlier regiments clothed initially in militia gray, the 13th was issued regulation dark blue Federal regulation fatigue jackets, dark blue trousers, sky blue regulation caped overcoats, and prison- manufactured boots. The regiment appreciated the quality of the overcoats and footwear, but found the blouse and pants of poor quality. The 13th also was lucky to receive Enfield rifles instead of smoothbore 1842, rifled 1842, or German and Belgian smoothbores that were issued to other regiments training alongside them at the arsenal in Augusta.The regiment did, however, find the rushed manufacture of the Enfields leaving a rough finish which combined with its brass fittings made it difficult to keep clean. =1862= In January 1862, while in training in Augusta, the regiment, along with others there, suffered an outbreak of the measles, but lost no men to it. As training progressed, they heard rumors, which proved true, that the regiment was bound for duty with Major General (MGEN) Benjamin Butler in the Gulf of Mexico. On February 18, the regiment boarded the train in Augusta and traveled to Boston arriving on just before midnight on February 19. In Boston, Companies A, B, E, and I embarked on SS Mississippi for Ship Island, Mississippi, on February 20. Mississippi was scheduled for stops at Hampton Roads to pick up Butler, Hatteras Inlet to pick up Brigadier General (BGEN) Thomas Williams, and Key West for coal before arriving in Mississippi. At the stop at Norfolk, MGEN Benjamin Butler embarked. On February 26 off Hatteras, it ran into a winter storm (Butler referred to it as a hurricane) that lasted two days. After making it through the storm with the assistance of seamen in the 13th's ranks, Mississippi ran aground in clear weather and calm seas. With the assistance of the blockade vessel , she got away and limped to Port Royal where she was repaired. The four companies were transferred to SS Matanzas for the remainder of the voyage to Mississippi arriving March 20 at Ship Island and disembarking on March 22. The day after the four companies sailed from Boston, the remainder (C, D, F, G, and K) entrained for New York embarking February 27 on SS Fulton. Due to missing the bad weather and grounding, these companies arrived almost two weeks before the others. On March 31, the 13th was brigaded with the 30th Massachusetts, the 1st Battery Maine Volunteer Light Artillery, the 12th, 14th, and 15th Maine as the 3rd Brigade of the Department of the Gulf under the command of Colonel George Shepley, the commander of the 12th Maine. As such, it was kept in reserve on Ship Island while New Orleans was taken. The regiment continued training and drilling on Ship Island beset by disease spread by fleas and mosquitoes native to the island. Detachments of the regiment were sent into the defenses of New Orleans, July 5, 1862, and the entire regiment was ordered there September 1. By this time, the dark blue jacket and trousers had been replaced by the standard federal uniform of dark blue sack coat and sky blue trousers. Through the remainder of 1862, the regiment was dispersed by companies through various strong points in New Orleans' defenses. Companies C and K were at Fort Pike and Fort Macomb guarding the entrance to Lake Pontchartrain. The remainder of the regiment garrisoned a pair of forts downriver from New Orleans on either side of Plaquemines bend, Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip. On the south side, Fort Jackson was held by Companies A, D, G, and I manned the walls. On the north side, Fort St Philip held companies B, E, and H. Although Butler's governance of New Orleans was popular in the North, Butler was replaced by Nathaniel P. Banks in December 1862. Banks soon began planning more military operations throughout the Department. =1863= When Banks reorganized his command in the Department, the 13th became an independent command within XIX Corps. As such, through the first three-quarters of 1863, the regiment remained in garrison at the forts inspecting the shipping and fishing traffic passing from Lake Pontchartrain into the Gulf of Mexico and down the Mississippi Delta to the gulf. The commanders of the stations took great pains to keep the regiment well-drilled and proficient in their arms throughout this period. During the first half of the war, the Union Navy had successfully blockaded many Southern ports along the Gulf Coast. Cotton trade was a major economic asset for Texas and the whole Confederacy. Initially cotton was transported to Brazos Santiago Pass at the delta of the Rio Grande and exported from Port Isabel. Union forces captured this port and trade was moved inland to Brownsville, Texas. From Brownsville goods were transported across the border to Matamoros and from there to neutral ports along the Mexican coast. South Texas Expedition In the fall of 1863, the Union wanted to shut down the last holdout was in the Corpus Christi/Brownsville area at the mouth of the Rio Grande. Banks launched his Texas Coast operations in October to close the gap once and for all. Another issue for seizing Brownsville was the U.S. government was also anxious to show Union presence along the Mexican border since the French Army had just invaded Mexico and installed Maximillian, and there was an increasing tension and hostility with the French and Imperial Mexican forces. The Union planned to shut down the port and at the same time give a boost to Ju√°rez. The Confederate forces in the area were commanded by General Hamilton P. Bee. Bee's forces consisted of a mere four companies from the 33rd Texas Cavalry under Colonel James Duff and another two companies of three-month volunteers. All other Confederates along the coast had been called elsewhere in the wake of the Union attack at Sabine Pass. The total Confederate force amounted to roughly 150 men stationed at Fort Brown. The 13th, with the 15th Maine, transferred from XIX Corps to XIII Corps for this operation as part of this expeditionary force. The 13th became part of the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division commanded by Colonel William M. Dye's. The expeditionary force and its small fleet of steamer transports and towed sailing supply vessels arrived at the mouth of the Rio Grande shortly after noon, November 1, 1863. On November 2, the 13th landed on the east end of Brazos Island. On November 4 after unloading all necessary arms, supplies, and equipment, the XIII Corps moved west to Clarksville at the mouth of the Rio Grande. The 13th and the 20th Wisconsin stayed in Clarksville for a day while the rest of the brigade moved on to Brownsville with the rest of XII Corps. On November 2, Bee had dispatched two companies of his cavalry to observe and report on the Union landing. Company A under Captain Richard Taylor arrived at the mouth of the Rio Grande while company F under Captain Henry Davis arrived at Point Isabel further north. On November 2 Captain Taylor informed General Bee the Union forces had landed cavalry while Bee made preparatory orders for the evacuation of Brownsville. Battle of Brownsville The 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division led the Union advance up the river on Brownsville. After chasing off Duff's cavalry, Dye's men entered the Brownsville around 10:00 on November 6, 1863. As the Union forces spread out through the city. General Bee quickly ordered the evacuation of the city and abandoned Fort Brown. He personally supervised the burning of what military supplies and cotton he could. Inside the fort was of condemned explosives which caused a great explosion much to the terror of the local citizens. The Confederates' destruction spread into the city while the soldiers resorted to looting prompting the local citizens into a degree of opposition. A local resident by the name of General Jos√© Maria Cobos was a Mexican general and refugee living in exile due to the recent French invasion. General Cobos received permission from the civilian authorities in Brownsville to organize a force to resist the looters and subdue the fires started by the Confederate evacuation. Around noon General Banks personally arrived in the city and by 4:00pm the remaining Union forces arrived. Colonel Dye was put in command of the post and the Union army encamped in the city, the army barracks at Fort Brown having been destroyed. The Union forces also captured a large supply of cotton left behind by the Confederates. Chaos in Matamoros Shortly after helping stop the looting and the fires in Brownsville, General Cobos led a force across the river and seized Matamoros. Banks was in communication with Secretary of State William Seward and keeping Washington informed of the political situation in Mexico. The French had sought and received Confederate support while aiding the Confederacy when and where they could. The Union consistent with its desire to preserve its republic supported the Republicans under Juarez. Cobos while no friend of the Hapsburgs nor French was also a conservative reactionary who denounced Juarez as a demagogue. Cobos had received the support of the local bandit chieftain, Cortina to take power, but they fell out the next day and Cortina executed Cobos. The 13th and other men of XIII Corps were witness to this chaos across the river and were kept on alert during the remainder of their stay in Brownsville. The instability in Mexico would serve as a distraction to the Union for the remainder of the war in South Texas. Battle of Mustang Island Following the Battle of Brownsville, the 13th Maine and the rest of XIII Corps consolidated a garrison there under Major General Napoleon J. T. Dana. General Banks planned to move against Corpus Christi. Banks sent BGEN Thomas E. G. Ransom on an expedition against a Confederate earthen fortification on Mustang Island known as Fort Semmes. The Confederate garrison, of less than 100 men, was composed of detachments from the 3rd Texas State Militia under Major George O. Dunaway and the 8th Texas Infantry under Captain William N. Maltby. Ransom's force consisted of the 13th and 15th Maine, 34th and 26th Iowa, 8th Indiana, and one battery of artillery numbering around 1,500 men. Ransom's men marched to Point Isabel where on November 15, the force embarked on SS Matamoros and SS Planter. Once across the bar at the estuary, the force steamed north along South Padre and Padre Islands to Mustang Island, a barrier island at the mouth of Corpus Christi Bay. Arriving at Corpus Christi Pass in the late morning of November 16, Ransom found the water too shallow in the pass to allow the force to land the troops on the inside shore of Mustang Island. They opted to make the riskier landing through the surf on the outer shore. Lieutenant Colonel (LTCOL) Hesseltine of the 13th was the first ashore followed by the rest of the regiment. The landing was not finished until after sunset, but looking to steal an opportunity on rebels, Ransom had his force march through the night to within of the fort by 0400. As dawn broke, the march to the fort continued. Upon reports from scouts of rebel pickets, Ransom deployed the 13th Maine ahead of the column in skirmish order. Fort Semmes, occupied by men from the 8th Texas Infantry and 3rd Texas State Militia, was an earthen battery of three cannon designed to control traffic through Aransas Pass and, therefore, not designed to resist a land attack from the south. The skirmishers of the 13th were soon in contact with the small force of pickets inland from the pass. After the 13th fired a volley that sent the rebels back to the fort, Ransom deployed the 20th Iowa, 13th Maine and 15th Maine Infantry Regiments in line of battle while fired into the fort from offshore. The regiments advanced stopping to fire volleys as they got closer to the earthworks. The small garrison of Fort Semmes was not prepared for open battle and the fighting was over shortly after the attack commenced. Major Dunaway decided upon an unconditional surrender of the entire garrison rather than making an attempt to fight their way back to the mainland. Despite having been away from Maine for a little more than eighteen months, this was the 13th's (and the 15th's) first real combat, and BGEN Ransom commended both regiments for their conduct both on the march and in the combat. The attack captured 9 officers, 89 men, 100 small arms, 3 heavy cannon, 140 horses, 125 head of cattle, a \\"nearly new\\" schooner and a lot of wagons and small boats. As Ransom's brigade consolidated Corpus Christi, MGEN Cadwallader C. Washburn arrived at Corpus with another brigade head of the Union expedition on the Texas Coast. Battle of Fort Esperanza The forces under MGEN Washburn remained at Aransas Pass for five days preparing their continued advance north along the Texas coast toward Matagorda Island. On the north end of Matagorda Island lay Fort Esperanza commanded by Colonel William R. Bradfute with a garrison of detachments from his own 8th Texas Infantry and the 5th Texas Militia regiment as well as a few local militiamen from the area. The expeditionary force. led by the 13th's brigade under Ransom marched up the length of St. Joseph Island and began constructing a ferry to get across Cedar Bayou on November 23. Due to light skirmishing and bad weather, they took two days to cross. Once across they encamped to wait for the next Federal brigade under Colonel Henry D. Washburn to cross. On November 27 General Washburn arrived on the scene and ordered Ransom's brigade up the center of the island while Colonel Washburn's brigade moved on a parallel route along the coast. Washburn's brigade reached Fort Esperanza first. The Federals encountered pickets from the 8th Texas Infantry who retreated within the fortification after a brief reconnoitering skirmish. Bad weather limited activity on November 28 to minor skirmishing and occasional artillery fire which produced no results for either side. The weather turned bad again on November 27 and combined with a lack of requisite boats to thwart a planned leapfrog to McHenry Island behind the fort. On November 29 with Ransom's brigade in place two Union batteries opened the fight with an artillery bombardment. Union infantry then drove in the Texas infantry from the exterior rifle pits while artillery continued with great accuracy against the Confederate defenses. Colonel Bradfute held a council of war that evening and decided to abandon the fort. Shortly after midnight November 30, Bradfute's men detonated the fort‚Äôs magazines, spiked the cannon and withdrew. The explosion signaled the Confederates' evacuation and the Union force entered the fort only to realize the Confederate had already withdrawn. Two Indiana regiments were ordered to pursue the retreating garrison but managed only to capture an artillery piece used to guard the crossing point. Though much of the artillery and ammunition was destroyed General Washburn's expedition succeeded in capturing the fort and found much needed supplies left behind. The Confederate suffered one killed and ten captured while the Union soldiers suffered one killed and ten wounded. Medal of Honor action After Esperanza's capture, the force set up camps on either side of the pass. The 13th began the camp routine of drilling and digging shelters into the dunes due to the lack of tents. MGEN Washburn began gaining intelligence that the rebel state commander in Texas, MGEN John Magruder had promised to drive south from his recaptured Galveston to drive the expeditionary force into the sea and reopen Texas. To preclude that, Washburn frequently sent small reconnaissance patrols in land and up the coast. On December 28, 1863, one of these patrols was conducted by the 13th Maine led by LTCOL Hesseltine on the Matagorda Peninsula. The 100 picked men were from companies C, H, and K. The patrol embarked on and traveled north to a point from the head of the peninsula with an eye to coming upon any rebel scouting force from the rear as they swept south on the island. Landing in heavy surf at daybreak on December 29, Hesseltine sent detachments out for signs of enemy activity. Soon, heavy seas and high winds cut off communications with Granite City. The small detachments returned with no reports of rebel activity. Hesseltine spread his men in skirmish order across the width of the island and started sweeping south with Granite City offshore to provide any naval gunfire support (NGFS). His command found the movement difficult so that by 1400, they had only moved south . To speed his movement, he decided to pull his skirmish order in tighter. Hearing a whistle from Granite City and then the firing of its gun, he looked at the ship's target with his telescope and saw a large body of Confederate cavalry coming down from the north in his rear. He continued his movement south but maintained a watch on the cavalry. The NGFS was not having great effect on the cavalry only killing a few so that by 1430, the cavalry was close enough to start firing on his skirmish line. At this time Hesseltine had half his line turn about and fire a volley at their pursuers which scattered the horsemen. Eventually, the patrol reached a point of the island where its width narrowed to . Hesseltine put the patrol in line of battle across the neck, but the cavalry started fording the bayou inside the island to get to the patrol's rear. Having his patrol quick-time its way further south as he looked for a spot to stand. He found a depression in the dunes surrounded by driftwood and brambles that formed a natural redan with its opening to the beach under the cover of Granite City. The cavalry force made several attempts to approach and recon the position, but the 13th sent them back with accurate gunfire each time. While the rebels tried to figure out their next course of action, darkness fell on November 29. The patrol lit fires to let Granite Citys relief, know where they were. The patrol and its NGFS had inflicted many casualties on the rebels, but had yet to suffer a loss themselves. For many of the men in the patrol, this was still only their third or fourth time in combat. The drilling that the regiment constantly conducted while in garrison was paying off in fire discipline and steadiness. Hesseltine kept the men at the barricades all night. The morning of December 30 was heavy with fog that impeded both the Union and Confederate forces. When it lifted midday, the gunboat CSS John F. Carr steamed down the interior bay to shell the makeshift fort \\"with her 20-pounder Parrott, making some very good shots, but injuring no one.\\" At 1500 Hesseltine's small command was without food and water, and he decided to slip his men out of the position and head south on the island. The rebels were unaware of the escape and continued shelling the position. Driving a handful of rebel scouts before them, the patrol continued marching in the dark in the midst of a terrible storm until 0100 on December 30 (this storm also ran CSS John F. Carr aground to wreck on a sandbar leading the Confederates to scuttle her lest she be captured). At daybreak they resumed their trek and by 1400 had reconnected with Sciota and through heavy surf reembarked for Corpus Christi. In his report Hesseltine sang the praises of all his subordinates the steadiness and tactical proficiency of the men in his patrol, and specifically lauded the two US Navy ships concluding his report with: The conduct and the patrol led the Confederates to believe their forces had encountered to be about 300 and for propaganda purposes reported in the papers that their force was of equal size despite their own military records. Hesseltine was later awarded the Medal of Honor for this action. =1864= In January 1864, Hesseltine became the commander of the regiment when Rust was promoted to command the brigade. On February 25, the regiment departed Texas to return to Louisiana. The two regiments who had been in garrison before the expedition and seen little action were recognized by other commands in the department as solid units. After their return to Louisiana from Texas, the 13th along with the 15th was transferred from XIII Corps to XIX Corps. Their old brigade commander, BGEN Ransom was promoted to command of XII Corps. The two Maine regiments were brigaded with the 160th New York and the 47th Pennsylvania in the 2nd Brigade under BGEN James McMillen in the 1st Division under BGEN William Emory in MGEN William B. Franklin's XIX Corps. In that transfer, Rust resumed command of the regiment. Red River Campaign In that organization, they participated in the Red River Campaign designed to capture Shreveport, Louisiana and sever Texas from the rest of the Confederacy. XIX Corps would join XIII Corps in Banks' column. (Some historians have claimed that the campaign was also motivated by the continuing distraction down near the scene of 13th's exploits in the last quarter of 1863, the 25,000 French troops in Mexico sent by Napoleon III and under the command of Emperor Maximilian). The plan was Banks would take 20,000 troops (XIII Corps in two divisions, XIX in two divisions, a cavalry division, and a brigade of US Colored Troops) on a route up the Bayou Teche, where they would be met by 10,000 men from XVI Corps and XVII Corps from the Army of the Tennessee under the command of Brigadier General A. J. Smith. Smith's forces were available to Banks only until the end of April, when they would be sent back east where they were needed for other Union military actions. Banks would command this combined force of 30,000, which would be supported in its march up the Red River towards Shreveport by Union Navy Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter's fleet of gunboats. At the same time, 7,000 Union troops from the Department of Arkansas under the command of MGEN Frederick Steele would be sent south from Arkansas to rendezvous with Banks in his attack on Shreveport, and to serve as the garrison for that city after its capture. Heavy late winter and early spring rains delayed the movement up from New Orleans. Banks halted at Natchitoches to consolidate his forces and rendezvous with Porter's flotilla. Although there were signs of the enemy, regular contact and light skirmishing only became daily on March 21. The 13th as it moved with its brigade, had no contact with the rebels as it moved up the river. They noted the change from sugar plantations to cotton plantations as they moved further northwest and into the pines. They saw little of their corps commander, Franklin, but frequently saw the XIII's commander, Ransom, under whom they served in Texas and held in high regard. At this time opposed by a numerically inferior force led by Major General Richard Taylor, Banks and his staff expected no real resistance. Even still, Banks inexplicably veered away from the river and Dixon's support to chase Taylor into dense pine forests. The roads were poor and the army was strung out for miles along the Mansfield Road in a dense pine forest. On April 8 he reached Sabine Crossroads. =Battle of Mansfield/Battle of Sabine Crossroads= The 13th Maine as part of Emory's Division was in the reserve taking turns with the other regiments in the division manning the rear guard when the expedition made contact with the rebels. The lead elements, XIII Corps, deployed in battle piecemeal, found themselves outnumbered locally, and were feeling increased pressure from their flanks. At 1600, Walker's Texas Division thrashed and shattered the left wing of XIII Corps. As the situation worsened, Banks called up XIX Corps. As Emory's Division was committed to the battle, they had to quick-time their way past the traffic jam of XIII Corps' wagons and artillery stuck on the road. Eventually, they met elements of XIII Corps thoroughly routed streaming back down the road. Emory deployed his division atop a ridge that descended to Chatman's Bayou with every member knowing how dire their situation was. The 13th as part of 2nd Brigade was kept in reserve. The rebels attacked and were thrown back repeatedly with severe losses. The 15th Maine and 160th New York were soon committed. Eventually, the 13th and the 47th Pennsylvania were committed to shore up the right wing from an enveloping attack and repulsed the rebels. The battle ended with nightfall. The Battle of Mansfield (or Battle of Sabine Crossroads) was a strategic and tactical disaster for the expedition, but Emory's Division held its field at the end of battle. Most of the Union losses were from units outside of Emory's Division. This was also the first time that the 13th had seen heavy combat. Of note, it was remarked in official reports and regimental histories in being a battle where artillery played almost no role. As in Texas, men of the 13th found that all their drilling had paid off: Further, in his post-action report, Banks wrote: As the expedition prepared to withdraw, the men of the 13th learned that their old commander, Ransom, had been seriously wounded in the day's action. =Battle of Pleasant Hill= Shortly after midnight, the 13th received orders to withdraw quietly from their positions. The force was to fall back to unite with BGEN A. J. Smith at Pleasant Hill. As they slipped away, the 13th found they had lost two killed and eight wounded in the battle (a further five were separated from the regiment during the retreat and were taken prisoner by the rebels). Due to the darkness and the order to maintain silence, the 13th Maine did not reach Pleasant Hill until 0900 on 9 April. The 13th and McMillan's brigade were the rear guard during the march. Back at Mansfield, Taylor did not learn of Banks' retreat until dawn. He then ordered an immediate pursuit with BGEN Thomas Green's cavalry. Upon arrival at Pleasant Hill, Banks had his force prepare for battle and deploy to face the enemy with the 13th in Emory's division in the center left of the line. When the Green and his men came upon Banks' line of battle near the town of Pleasant Hill, they retreated a mile to wait for the infantry to arrive. By 1000, the 13th and its brigade had been relieved at the frontline by Shaw's brigade of the 3rd Division of A. J. Smith's XVI Corps and sent into reserve in the rear. At 1630, Confederate BGEN Thomas J. Churchill's arriving infantry started the attack on the Union forces striking Col Lewis Benedict's 3rd Brigade of Emory's Division. Taylor thought he was sending them into the Union flank, but it was actually the center. Confederate cavalry also miscalculated positions and suffered heavily from flank fire. Churchill's men did succeed in collapsing this Union center position, but this also brought his men into the middle of a U-shaped position, with A. J. Smith's unused divisions forming the base of the \\"U\\". The 13th was pulled out of reserve and sent to the advanced Union right which had also collapsed, but they were recalled to shore up the center to join a counterattack. As they were moving into position a fleeing artillery team drove through their formation completely disorganizing it and knocking it back to a ravine to regroup. From the ravine, the 13th advanced with its brigade joined by elements of Benedict's brigade who formed on McMillan's line of advance. The push drove Churchill's infantry back and members of, and, joined by neighboring regiments, they routed Taylor's men from the vicinity of Pleasant Hill. As they drove the Confederates from the field in disorder, some of the artillery that had been lost the day before in the train were recaptured. Being in possession of the field and having inflicted slightly higher losses on his enemy, Banks took stock of his expedition's status. Unknown to him, the state of his opponent was such that as Kirby Smith wrote, \\"Our repulse at Pleasant Hill was so complete and our command was so disorganized that had Banks followed up his success vigorously, he would have met but feeble opposition to his advance on Shreveport.\\" Short of water and feed for the horses, not knowing where his supply boats were, unaware of the depth of the wound he had dealt his opponent, and receiving divided opinions from his senior officers, Banks opted for a rapid retreat downriver to Natchitoches and Grand Ecore to rendezvous with the fleet. It was a tactical victory for the Federals, but a strategic Confederate one because the Union army retreated following the battle. The 13th had again performed well, but suffered losses. It last three killed, twenty-one wounded (seven of whom later died), and twenty-one missing, many of whom never returned to Maine after the war and were never heard of again. The regiment found the retreat after what they perceived a solid victory was \\"most unwelcome.\\" The 13th marched on April 10 and reached Grand Ecore by 1500, April 11. The regiment encamped an built fortifications along the river for nine days waiting for the fleet to get past the rapids that were a factor due to the unusually low level of the Red River that spring. =The Campaign Ends= At Grand Ecore near Natchitoches, Banks received confidential orders from Grant to move the army to New Orleans to avoid further jeopardizing the timetable for the attack on Mobile Bay. The river also continued to fall, and all the supply boats had to return downriver. Banks gave the order to return to Alexandria. On April 21, the regiment received orders to prepare to retreat further and destroy all property which could not be carried. The fires were a signal to the rebels \\"as if a courier had been sent into their camp.\\" By 0200, April 22, they were in line of march with their brigade. On the afternoon of April 23, the retreat was delayed as, Porter had run into a delaying ambush at the mouth of Cane River after he tarried to blow up the stuck . While occasionally under artillery fire, the 13th watched the other brigades in its division close with and drive off the rebels at Cane River Crossing allowing them to cross and Porter to move down river. The remainder of the march to Alexandria was uneventful for the 13th as they arrived there in the afternoon April 25. Sensing that they were involved in a perceived defeat, Banks's relations deteriorated with the cantankerous A. J. Smith and the Navy and with most of the other generals as well. He was determined to seize as much contraband as he could before retreating to the Mississippi and put his regiments on relief from manning the defenses to work loading cotton and sugar on the flotillas transports. The 13th spent all of May 11 performing this duty. As XIX Corps prepared to retreat along the river under the guns of the Navy, Porter could not get many of his ironclads over the falls at Alexandria. Colonel Joseph Bailey designed Bailey's Dam, to which Banks soon gave night-and-day attention. Several boats got through before a partial dam collapse. An extra upriver dam provided additional water depth, allowing the march to resume. By May 13, the last vessel made it over the dam and the expedition quit Alexandria. When the Federals left Alexandria, the town went up in flames, the origins of which are disputed. Because the Confederates had already burned most of the cotton that was not on the fleet's vessels, many speculators at Alexandria were disappointed. Unknown to Banks, Kirby Smith had taken half of Taylor's force to repel Steele to the northwest. As a result, Taylor tried to make it seem many more men were present, but he did not try to stop the dam construction. He did manage to sink two gunboats - and - and three transports - Emma, City Belle, and John Warner - downriver at Snaggy Point. Yet though General Taylor had promised to prevent the escape of the Federals, he could not do so. He blamed Kirby Smith for lack of support. The 13th marched southeast along the southern bank, occasionally seeing the flotilla shell rebel forces on the north bank. Midday May 15, the column stopped at Snaggy Point. John Warner had been carrying mail from the expedition south when it had been taken by the rebels. The 13th saw this mail torn open as the Confederates had been looked for money and found some of their own letters. En route to the Mississippi, an running engagement of a series of successful Union flanking movements was fought on the road to Mansura on May 16. In this action, the 13th was under artillery fire several times but found the Confederates had already retreated out of rifle range as the regiment advanced. In the halt at Masura, the 13th and its brigade discovered a shed with a large supply of tobacco and twenty barrels of salt meat intended for the rebel forces. The 13th and its brigade mates soon replenished their tobacco supply and seized the meat. The 13th and the rest of the Union force suffered no casualties. The 13th was kept ready but never played no part in the Yellow Bayou, the final conflict of the campaign which took place on May 18 with significant casualties in a burning forest. Transport ships were lashed together to allow Union forces to cross the wide Atchafalaya River. The force finally reached the Mississippi on May 21 and went into camp at Morganza. In this failed campaign, since March 7, the 13th Maine had marched over , had performed well at Mansfield and Pleasant Hill, and had been shelled at Cane River and Mansura. Northern Virginia The regiment remained at Morganza through the rest of May and into June. In late June, they started hearing rumors of movement. On July 1 they were told XIX Corps was going to Northern Virginia. On July 2, the 13th boarded a steamer and made for New Orleans. Despite other military departments were considered secondary to the Army of the Potomac; and that XIX Corps were under orders to proceed to Fortress Monroe as rapidly as possible, the 13th and its brethren waited for steamers to become available. On July 5, the command and seven companies of the 13th and the entire 29th Maine embarked on SS Clinton and the other three companies on another vessel. Just after dark that evening, the steamers unmoored and proceeded down river. By daylight the next morning, the 13th was steaming swiftly in the direction of Key West. Unlike their trip south in 1862, their journey to Hampton Roads was uneventful, \\"even stormy Cape Hatteras suffered us to pass without a ripple upon the water.\\" On the afternoon of July 12, the two ships anchored at Fortress Monroe, \\"in very nearly the same spot where the Mississippi had anchored on the 24th of February 1862.\\" Remaining overnight, they received orders to proceed to Washington in the morning. Just before noon on July 13, they debarked Long Bridge in Washington, DC. For the next week and a half, the 13th as part of XIX Corps chased Jubal Early's raiding force back and forth and up and down the Potomac in defense of the capital until July 24. The regiment camped at Chain Bridge, resting and refitting, until July 26, when they marched to Harpers Ferry arriving on July 29. When, news arrived of McCausland's raid into Pennsylvania and his revenge burning of Chambersburg, they marched back toward Washington reaching Frederick, Maryland on the afternoon July 31. The five companies that had taken the different steamer arrived in the afternoon of July 16 at Long Bridge They immediately joined other troops in pursuit of Early until July 17 when they boarded a steamer for Bermuda Hundreds, where they reported to General Butler. After spending a week on picket and on the skirmish line, they rejoined the regiment at Monocacy on July 31. On August 3, while at Monocacy, Emory, commander of XIX Corps, informed the Department that the 13th and 15th Maine had yet to receive their veteran furlough earned several months earlier. On August 5, the non-reenlisted men of the 13th were temporarily attached to the 30th Maine; while the reenlisted men took the cars for Baltimore on their way to Maine. They arrived at Augusta on August 9 and were furloughed on August 13. The furlough, expected to be only thirty days, was extended two weeks by a special order from the War Department. On September 26, they reassembled at Augusta, and the next day left for the front. They reached Harper's Ferry on October 1 where the regiment was rejoined the next day by the non-reenlisted men who had been with the 30th Maine. These men had had an eventful foray supporting MGEN Philip Sheridan and his army in the Shenandoah Valley. On August 14, the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, XIX Corps, to which the men of the 13th were attached, was detailed to guard the trains of Sheridan's army. For the next week, the train moved back and forth following the movement of the army through Winchester, Middletown, Newtown, Kernstown, and Charlestown. On August 19, the train stayed for two days at Gum Spring foraged aggressively. On August 21, nearing rebel forces caused the train to move to the bank of the Shenandoah at its junction with the Winchester Railroad. On August 28, the train was ordered to Harpers Ferry where it remained until the regiment returned from their furlough. On October 5, the 13th was ordered to garrison Martinsburg, Maryland to relieve the troops there who were ending their enlistment. The 13th happily set up residency in \\"Little Massachusetts\\" (called that by the rebels due to its strong pro-Union sentiment among its residents). The supply depot and the residents' political leanings made it a target for Confederate guerilla activity, but the 13th and the 15th Maine maintained a constant picket around the town and saw off all raiders without loss. The time off the picket line was spent loading and unloading supplies at the railroad. These two duties precluded the 13th from returning to its usual drilling while stationary. Despite several brief forays including a week at New Creek, Maryland, the 13th remained in Martinsburg until December 27 when orders arrived for all original members of the regiment who had not reenlisted to depart for Augusta to muster out. The 252 veterans and 82 recruits of the 13th were consolidated to a single battalion and transferred to 30th Maine on December 27, 1864. Those soldiers who did not reenlist were entrained on cattle cars that day. Reaching Baltimore on December 28, they were loaded onto passenger cars and headed home. They arrived in Augusta before 1700, December 30, \\"so near three years from the original muster-in date to the service as a regiment: Dec 31st, 1861.\\" After almost a week of processing paperwork, the men were discharged from service on January 6, 1865.

Fragmentation of the Duchy of Silesia begins, divided between: first son of W≈Çadys≈Çaw, Boles≈Çaw I the Tall (orange); second son of W≈Çadyslaw, Mieszko I PlƒÖtonogi (yellow); son of Boles≈Çaw, Jaros≈Çaw Opolski (green) Jaros≈Çaw of Opole (; aft. 1143 - 22 March 1201) was a Duke Opole from 1173 and Bishop of Wroc≈Çaw from 1198 until his death. He was the oldest son of Boles≈Çaw I the Tall, by his first wife Zvenislava, daughter of Vsevolod II Olgovich, Grand Prince of Kiev. His Russian name was given by his mother. Life It is unknown whether he was born already in Silesia or in exile, but he was brought up in Altenburg in the Holy Roman Empire and spent his childhood in the court of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. After the recovery of Silesia by his father and uncle Mieszko I Tanglefoot in 1163, he moved there with the rest of his family and was there when probably began his activity in politics. However, the second marriage of his father with the German lady Christina changed diametrally his situation. Jaros≈Çaw's stepmother began to intrigue, and Boles≈Çaw the Tall increasingly began to favored his younger sons. Jaros≈Çaw was forced into a religious career (in the 1160s or the 1170s) and his father decided to leave his inheritance to his sons from his second marriage. However, Jaros≈Çaw wasn't content with being removed from power (because, as the firstborn son he should have inherited Boles≈Çaw the Tall's part of the Duchy of Silesia) and began to intrigue with his uncle Mieszko Tanglefoot. His opportunity to reasume his rights come over soon. As a result of civil war during 1172‚Äì1173 Boles≈Çaw the Tall was exiled in Erfurt. Fortunately for him, Frederick Barbarossa decided to intervene, and through his mediation Boles≈Çaw could regained the power in Lower Silesia, but was forced to create the Duchies of Racib√≥rz (to Mieszko) and Opole (to Jaros≈Çaw). The next information founded to Jaros≈Çaw was in the 1190s. In 1195 Jaros≈Çaw supported his uncle Mieszko III the Old in the Battle of MozgawƒÖ, there the Silesian troops (then unnecessary because Mieszko III fled the battle before they arrived) were defeated by the Sandomierz Komes Goworek of Rawa. Three years later (1198) Jaros≈Çaw accepted entirely with his religious condition and has been elected Bishop of Wroclaw. Since them, the Duke-Bishop reconciled with his father. A further sign of the reconciliation between father and son was that in that period the Silesian coins showed their names together. Jaros≈Çaw died on 22 March 1201, few months before his father, who took the control over the Duchy of Opole. Ultimately, however, Opole was taken by Mieszko Tanglefoot at the beginning of the next year (1202), after a surprise attack to Henry I the Bearded, Boles≈Çaw the Tall's youngest son and successor. Jaros≈Çaw was probably buried in Wroclaw. References *Piastowie.

The trilogy revolves around Tanaquil, a young woman who is better at tinkering than magic, much to the dismay of her sorceress mother.  Black Unicorn  Black Unicorn (1991) is the first novel of The Unicorn Series. = Plot summary = It was big and beautiful and so black that it was like a hole in space, and it was completely impossible. Unicorns didn't belong in this world except in legends. But there it stood, radiating magical power, in the shattered wreck of the party. Nobody knew where it had come from, or what it wanted. Not even Jaive, the sorceress, could fathom the mystery of the fabled beast. But Tanaquil, Jaive's completely unmagical daughter, understood it at once. She knew why the unicorn was there: It had come for her. It needed her. Yet she was the girl with no talent for magic. She could only fiddle with broken bits of machinery and make them work again. What could she do for a unicorn? This unicorn, which once was of radiant mother of pearl hue, became of this world through majestic being and wondrous magnificence.  Gold Unicorn  Gold Unicorn (1994) is the second novel of The Unicorn Series. = Plot summary = After traveling the world, young sorceress Tanaquil begins her return home. On the way she discovers a vast army led by an empress - Lizra, Tanaquil's half-sister. Tanaquil's magical power of mending is exactly what Lizra needs. Lizra makes Tanaquil use her talent on her giant mechanical gold unicorn, which Tanaquil learns is a war-machine that her sister is planning on using to perfect a world she sees as flawed. Tanaquil is repelled by Lizra's acts of destruction, but her attraction to Lizra's betrothed, a young man named Honj, keeps her from leaving, so she follows the unicorn, even when it leads into a terrifying alternate world.  Red Unicorn  Red Unicorn (1997) is the third and final novel of The Unicorn Series. = Plot summary = Tanaquil finally returns to her mother's fortress in the desert, but only disappointment and heart-ache await her. As she contemplates leaving once again when a red unicorn appears, and she follows it into a mirror where she finds a world that exact opposite of her own, complete with a version of herself named Tanakil.

This led to his participation in the Genoese war with Venice over the next few years.Miller (1913), pp. 420f Around 1438, apparently through the efforts of the Byzantine Empress Maria, Dorino's daughter Maria was married to Alexander of Trebizond, the exiled despotes of Trebziond, thus pulling Dornio into the politics of that Pontic state.William Miller, \\"The Chronology of Trebizond\\", The English Historical Review, 38 (1923), p. 409 According to Pero Tafur who met the exile at Mytilene on his homeward journey, Alexander \\"was preparing ships to set out for Trebizond against his brother.\\" Tafur shared with him the news to Alexander that John had concluded an alliance with \\"the Turk\\", which had been sealed with John's marriage to \\"a daughter of a Turk\\", and that it would be detrimental to all to make war.A. Vasiliev, \\"Pero Tafur, a Spanish Traveler of the XVth Century and his Visit to Constantinople, Trebizond, and Italy\\", Byzantion 7 (1932), p. 117 Genoese archives contain a copy of a letter written on 10 March 1438 to Dorino Gattilusio, in which they urge him to do what he could to bring peace between Alexander and his brother, and containing an offer of a pension to Alexander if he dropped his plans which would allow him to live where ever he wanted to, Mytilene, or Constantinople. The Republic of Genoa had business interests in Trebizond that might be harmed in a civil war between the brothers.Michel Kur≈°anskis, \\"La descendance d'Alexis IV, empereur de Tr√©bizonde. Contribution √† la prosopographie des Grands Comn√®nes\\", Revue des √©tudes byzantines, 37 (1979), p. 241 During his tenure as lord of Lesbos, the castle of Kokkinos on Lemnos and the island of Thasos came under his control.Miller (1913), pp. 422f However, Dorino was bed-ridden from 1449 onwards and his son Domenico handled the business of his realm in his name.Miller (1913), p. 427 Following the Fall of Constantinople, Ottoman hegemony in the Aegean increased unchecked. When the Turkish admiral Hamza anchored off Lesbos in June 1455, on his way to Rhodes, his son Domenico thought it a wise diplomatic move to send his factor, the historian Doukas, to the dignitary with handsome gifts of \\"garments of silk, 8 woven wool garments, 6,000 minted silver coins, 20 oxen, 50 sheep, more than 800 measures of wine, 2 measures of biscuits, one measure of bread, more than 1000 litres of cheese, and fruit without measure\\", as well as gifts to the members of the admiral's staff.Doukas 43.5; translated by Harry J. Magoulias, Decline and Fall of Byzantium to the Ottoman Turks (Detroit: Wayne State University, 1975), p. 246 Dorino died not long after this visit.  Family  Dorino married Orietta Doria. Orietta won fame in 1450 when she led the inhabitants of Mithymna on Lesbos to beat back a Turkish attack on Lesbos.Miller (1913), p. 426 The couple had six known children: *Francesco III Gattilusio, Lord of Thasos. Married a daughter of his paternal uncle Palamede of Ainos. *Domenico Gattilusio. Reigned from 1455 to 1458. *Niccol√≤ Gattilusio. Reigned from 1458 to 1462. *Ginevra Gattilusio.

He founded the BMW Diesel Development Center in Steyr, Austria. He was born in Szolnok, Hungary. He graduated in 1962 from the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. He got a job on 1964 in Szolnok at a local engineer office; a few years later he moved to Germany, and there he finished his PhD in Braunschweig in 1973 after learning German in only a few months. Besides cars he developed diesel engines for trucks and ships too. In October 1965 he started to work for M.A.N. and he developed ship engines and he made a lot of experiment with Rudolf Diesel's bench of experimental. At the latter from his office at the Lake of Constance he could see three countries at once. He was developing the diesel engines of FIAT there. At the Zurich University they already tested the common rail engines even though they didn't know at the time that would be the injection system of the future. That was the time when one of his colleagues called him back first to Mannheim, then asked him to lead the diesel development of BMW in Steyr. The new 4-cylinder engine was as powerful as the older 6-cylinder, was less in size with better fuel mileage. That engine made the engineer world famous. Under his leadership, the electronically controlled diesel injection system was introduced in 1993 for which Dr. Anisits received the Ernst Blickle Innovation Award in 1995. This development laid the foundation to the modern direct injection diesel engine. In 1998 at the 24 Hours N√ºrburgring race the world saw the first victory of a diesel-powered car. The 3 Series BMW outperformed its petrol driven rivals. The most exciting part of his life when he started to work than BMW in Steyr, where he spent 19 years and developed the world's first direct injection diesel, a V8. This one and a 6-cylinder version became the \\"International Engine of the Year\\" in 1999 and 2000. He has developed three generations of Diesel engines for BMW. Hungarian journalists jokingly asked him at one Munich Technik Tag around 2000 why the otherwise exceptionally well-designed BMW 320d is so noisy. He answered: \\"Our diesels from Graz suddenly became too good for the Munich petrol engines to compete with. You think the headquarters would allow them to be quiet as well? Who would buy cars with petrol engines then?\\" In 2001 he became the Freeman of Szolnok, his town of birth. In 2006 40% of all sold BMWs were diesel powered. In 2007 and 2008 BMW spends 14 million euros on the expansion of the Diesel Development Center at the Steyr factory. In 2008 BMW enters the North American market with a diesel-powered car.

History The group's members all attended William Penn High School (York, Pennsylvania), and originally formed in 1957 under the name The Quinteros to sing at local functions. Paul Landersman, a disc jockey at WHGB in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania became their manager and had them record four songs. The first to be released was \\"Ding Dong\\", issued on Chess Records in 1958; the song did not chart but the group received some notice for the tune. \\"Down the Aisle of Love\\" was the next single, a marriage song which opened with the melody of \\"Here Comes the Bride\\". It was initially released on Red Top Records but, once it started to sell, was redistributed by Hunt Records. The song became a nationwide hit, reaching No. 5 on the US Billboard R&B; chart, and No. 18 on the Billboard Hot 100. Following this the group appeared on American Bandstand and toured the country, including an August 23, 1958, show at the Apollo Theater with The Coasters, The Olympics, The Spaniels, and The Chantels, at which they received a standing ovation. \\"There Be No Sorrow\\" and \\"Heavenly Father,\\" follow-up singles recorded under new management, failed to chart.

He was a son of Dorino I Gattilusio and Orietta Doria.  Life  Domenico served as regent for his father after the latter became bed-ridden in 1449. He succeeded his father on the latter's death, at a time of growing Ottoman hegemony; when the Turkish admiral, on his way to Rhodes, anchored off Lesbos in June 1455, Domenico sent his official, the historian Doukas, to the dignitary with handsome gifts of \\"garments of silk, 8 woven wool garments, 6,000 minted silver coins, 20 oxen, 50 sheep, more than 800 measures of wine, 2 measures of biscuits, one measure of bread, more than 1000 litres of cheese, and fruit without measure\\", as well as gifts to the members of the admiral's staff.Doukas 43.5; translated by Harry J. Magoulias, Decline and Fall of Byzantium to the Ottoman Turks (Detroit: Wayne State University, 1975), p. 246 Not long after this visit Domenico's father died; Domenico made himself lord over his father's territories‚Äîat this point comprising the islands of Lesbos, Thasos, Lemnos and the mainland town of Phocaea‚Äîwhile appointing his younger brother Niccol√≤ his governor of Lemnos.Miller (1913), p. 428 When Doukas took the annual tribute to Sultan Mehmed II in Adrianople that August, the Sultan learned that Dorino had died and Domenico was now lord of Lesbos; this angered the Sultan, and Doukas was informed that no one had the right to assume the title of lord of Lesbos until he had received it from the hands of the Sultan himself. Nervous negotiations followed, and Domenico only obtained title to his inheritance after surrendering the isle of Thasos and paying an increased tribute of 4000 gold pieces, instead of the 3000 previously given. But that was not the only loss to Domenico's realm, for on the excuse of l√®se-majest√© the Turkish admiral Yunus Pasha sailed to Phocaea and seized it outright for the Sultan on 31 October 1455.Miller (1913), p. 430 After the Sultan's men captured the mainland town of Ainos (modern Enez in Turkey) 24 January 1456 and annexed the islands of Samothrace and Imbros from Domenico's cousin Dorino later that year, a Papal fleet under the command of the Cardinal Ludovico Trevisan, Patriarch of Aquileia, arrived in the northern Aegean Sea in the autumn of 1456. This fleet swiftly took the islands of Samothrace, Thasos, and Imbros from the Ottomans, but instead of returning them to the Gattilusio family, appointed governors to rule them in the name of the Pope. Sultan Mehmed vented his resentment upon Domenico, whom he held responsible for these losses, by sending his admiral Ishmael in August 1457 to attack Lesbos. Despite the flight of the Papal fleet from Lesbos, the garrison of Molivos resisted so successfully so that the Turkish commander was forced to withdraw on 9 August. Upon the departure of the Turkish forces, the Papal fleet returned to be greeted with indignation by Domenico Gattilusio.Miller (1913), pp. 431-435 Domenico reigned over the island for three years. He was deposed by his younger brother Niccol√≤, who had him imprisoned and ordered his execution by the garrote. Domenico married Maria Giustiniani-Longo. They had no known children.

Drawings of part of the interior were exhibited by Papworth during the Royal Hibernian Annual Exhibition of 1850. The Victoria Cross- winning soldier George Boyd-Rochfort and his younger brother, racehorse trainer Cecil Boyd-Rochfort, were born at Middleton Park. The house was host to a number of celebrities in the 1930s and 1940s, such as Rita Hayworth (who married Prince Aly Khan in 1949). The House and estate remained in the Boyd- Rochfort family until the early 1960s when it was sold. Since then it has seen many owners, including gambler Barney Curley who raffled the House in 1986.

It is found in temperate, subtropical and tropical seas around the world. It is a popular quarry species for recreational fisheries as well as being an important species in commercial fisheries. It is the largest species in the family Carangidae. Description The greater amberjack is a large predatory fish which has a body colouring which varies from brownish to bluish-grey on the dorsal surfaces contrasting with the silevery-white underparts, There is a diagonal sooty stripe which starts at the snout and runs along the centre of the back dorsal fin, another dark stripe runs from the upper jaw, through the eye to in front of the first dorsal fin.. Some fishes may show a light yellow to reddish-brown stripe along the flanks. The fins are dusky in colour. The second dorsal and anal fins have a low anterior lobe. Small juveniles have clear fins and a series of five vertical bands along the body and a sixth band on the caudal peduncle. The shape of the body is elongated and fusiform and it is of moderate depth, laterally compressed and has a covering of small cycloid scales. The largest fish have been measured at in total length but the more frequent length found is , while the largest published weight is . New South Wales Distribution The greater amberjack has an almost circum-global distribution in the subtropical and tropical seas and oceans of the world. In the Indian Ocean it is found along the African coast from South Africa east through the Persian Gulf to Western Australia and southern Japan, reaching the Hawaiian Islands and Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean. It reaches as far south as Tasmania off Australia. In the western Atlantic Ocean this species is found around Bermuda and on the North American coast as far north as Nova Scotia extanding south as far as Brazil, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. In the eastern Atlantic Ocean it has been recorded as a vagrant as far north as the British Isles and is found off in the Bay of Biscay south to Morocco and in the Mediterranean Sea. It may occur along the west African coast but here confusion with the similar Seriola carpenteri makes the position unclear. Habitat and biology=Habitat= The greater amberjack is found as solitary individuals or in small to moderate-sized schools which are epibenthic and pelagic and occur in the vicinity of reefs, deep offshore caves, drop-offs, rocky outcrops and deep seaward reefs. They will sometimes enter coastal bays while the juveniles are infrequently recorded quite far well out to sea where they shelter among floating algae, such as Sargassum and debris. It can also be found over wrecks. Smaller individuals, less than , can be caught in shallow water while the larger fish prefer deeper water, normally between and have been recorded at depths of . =Diet= Greater amberjacks are opportunistic predators when they are adults which prey on benthic and pelagic fishes as well as cephalopods and crustaceans. Common fish prey species include the bigeye scad (Selar crumenophthalmus) and sardines (Sardinella aurita and Sardina pilchardus). The juvenile fish feed on plankton including the larvae of decapods and other small invertebrates. The juveniles switch to feeding on larger prey such as larger benthic and nektonic organisms when they attain a length of and once they have grown larger than they restrict their prey choice to animals which swim on or over the substrate and when they attain they are mainly piscivorous and it is at this size that they move from open waters to more coastal areas. =Breeding= Seriola dumerli is gonochoric, meaning that the males and females are separate and determined at birth, and there is no sexual dimorphism other than size. The sexes begin to differentiate at around 4-5 months of age when they attain a length of and, In the Mediterranean, they reach sexual maturity at, respectively, 4 and 5 years of age when they attain a length of about in length) in males and females. In western Atlantic populations the males are mature after 3 years and and the females after 4 years of age and attaining . This species has been observed to show pair courtship off Belize where there were schools numbering around 120 individuals and pairing mainly occurred during when there was moon was either full or waning and between the months of February and October. They are sexually dimorphic with the females noticeably larger than the males. Half of the males are sexually mature at fork length for males half of the females are sexually mature on attaining fork length. This is a highly fecund fish and a single female may lay 18 to 59 million eggs in a single spawining season. Off the coast of Florida spawning peaks in April and May and each female is estimated to spawn once every four to five days during the spawning season, lasting around 60 days.I n the Mediterranean spawining takes place in June and July Spawning occurs over such habitats as reefs and shipwrecks, demonstrated by the abundance of juveniles in these habitats in the summer following the spring spawning in the western Atlantic. The eggs are in diameter and after spawning the embryo takes around 40 hours to develop and the newly hatched larvae take 31‚Äì36 days to develop into juveniles. They can live to be 17 years of age. =Predators and parasites= Greater amberjack are preyed on by larger fishes including the yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and European hake (Merluccius merluccius), and seabirds including the brown noddy (Anous stolidus), and sooty tern (Sterna fuscata). Tapeworms are occasionally recorded as infesting this species, these worms being harmless to humans, albeit rather unappetising. The monogean Zeuxapta seriolae has been documented as living as a parasite on the gills of these fish. Human usage The greater amberjack is an important food fish and is a commercial quarry species as well as being popular in aquaculture. As a predatory fish it requires protein and lipids sourced from other fish so there are questions over the sustainability of its culture. It is also a popular game species for angling. The meat is used for sushi and sashimi in Japan, while in Florida and Mexico its flesh is marketed fresh and can be fried, broiled, baked, or grilled. They have been used in aquaculture in the Mediterraean since the 1980s. Angling techniques used to catch greater amberjacks include trolling at the surface with various artificial lures and natural baits. They are often incidentally caught by anglers who are fishing the seabed for snappers and groupers. Greater amberjack baked with olive oil Taxonomy and etymology The greater amberjack was formally described as Caranx dumerili by the French naturalist Antoine Risso in 1810 with the type locality given as Nice, France. The binomial consists of the generic name which is the Italian name for this species, Whilte the specific name is patronymic, the identity of the person honoured in the patronym was not identified by Risso but it is almost certainly the French zoologist Andr√© Marie Constant Dum√©ril (1774‚Äì1860), who was the father of another well-known French zoologist Auguste Dum√©ril (1812‚Äì1870). It is the type species of the genus Seriola References Greater amberjack Category:Fish of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Fish of the Indian Ocean Category:Fish of the Pacific Ocean Category:Fish of the Mediterranean Sea Category:Fish described in 1801 Category:Taxa named by Antoine Risso ","title":"Greater amberjack"},{"id":"15116938","text":"Marv Allemang (born 3 December 1953) is a former professional Canadian football offensive lineman and defensive lineman who played 14 seasons in the Canadian Football League. He most notably played center for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Ottawa Rough Riders later in his career. Allemang played for Acadia University and was nominated for the J. P. Metras Trophy for outstanding intercollegiate lineman in 1974. He played for the Rough Riders from 1975 to 1976. After winning the 64th Grey Cup with the Rough Riders, Allemang spent one season with the Tiger-Cats. From 1979 to 1981, he played for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers before returning to Hamilton from 1982 to 1986. He was part of the 74th Grey Cup championship-winning Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the 1986 CFL season. He returned to spend his final two years in the CFL with Ottawa, retiring after the 1988‚Äì89 season.  College career  Allemang played college football for the Acadia Axemen as both a tight end and defensive lineman until 1974. He was named an Atlantic Universities Athletic Association (AUAA) All-Star three times during his career. Allemang was also named an All-Canadian as a junior and senior. In his final year with the Axemen, Allemang was the AUAA nominee for the newly created J. P. Metras Trophy, an award for the most outstanding lineman in Canadian intercollegiate football.  Professional career = Ottawa Rough Riders = Allemang was selected in the first round of the 1975 CFL Draft by the Ottawa Rough Riders with the seventh overall pick. He played in all regular season games with the Rough Riders from 1975 to 1976. In the 1975 season, the Rough Riders lost in the East Division Final. The following season, they won the 64th Grey Cup, making Allemang a Grey Cup champion for the first time. = Hamilton Tiger- Cats = Allemang was signed by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats before the 1977 season, and he went on to play in 31 games for the Tiger-Cats through 1978. He was used in a variety of roles. While Al Romano was injured in 1978, Allemang featured as a starting defensive lineman. He later replaced the injured Bruce Holland as a defensive tackle. Outside of these brief stints as a starter, Allemang served as a back-up for both the offensive and defensive lines. = Winnipeg Blue Bombers = On 18 May 1979, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats traded Allemang and a draft pick to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers for linebacker Harry Walters and defensive end Jim Heighton. The retirement of the Buddy Brown left the Blue Bombers looking for an offensive guard, and they transitioned Allemang into this role on the right side of the offensive line. Allemang played in all 16 regular season games during the 1979 season, primarily on the offense. He returned to the defensive line in 1980 and alternated between the offense and defense for the remainder of his time with the Blue Bombers. In 1981, Allemang saw a reduced role, playing in only four games. After playing 36 total regular season games with the Blue Bombers, Allemang was cut in October 1981. =Return to Tiger-Cats= In March 1982, it was reported that the Montreal Alouettes were about to sign Allemang, but he instead joined the Tiger-Cats the following month. In 1983, Allemang was part of an offensive line that was described as \\"the worst in the CFL\\", but they allowed the fewest quarterback sacks and advanced to the East Final before losing to the Toronto Argonauts. The Tiger-Cats advanced to the Grey Cup in 1984 but lost to the Blue Bombers after the offensive line created only 24 rushing yards on nine carries. In 1985, Allemang was converted from an offensive tackle to a center, and his performance in his new role was described as \\"commendable\\" by head coach Al Bruno. Allemang was named an East Division all-star and nominated for the Leo Dandurand Trophy, which goes to the East Division's most outstanding offensive lineman. The Tiger-Cats again appeared in the Grey Cup game, losing to the BC Lions 37‚Äì24. In the championship game, the offensive line blocked to allow 213 rushing yards on 24 carries. Allemang remained a center in 1986 and received his second East Division all-star distinction. The Tiger-Cats won the 74th Grey Cup against the Edmonton Eskimos 39‚Äì15 after entering the game as severe underdogs, providing Allemang with his second Grey Cup ring. = Return to Rough Riders and retirement = Following the 1986 season, the CFL held an equalization draft in which the three teams that did not qualify for playoffs could draft certain players from the six teams that qualified for playoffs. In the equalization draft, the Ottawa Rough Riders acquired Allemang. The draft, which was held in secret and intentionally hidden from the media, received harsh criticism from the teams which lost players. Tiger-Cats personnel director Mike McCarthy referred to the equalization draft as a \\"socialist draft\\", and Allemang expressed discontent with the unexpected move to Ottawa. Allemang remained in his role as a center with the Rough Riders. In 1987, he played in 11 regular season games, missing time due to a knee injury which required surgery. Allemang re-signed with the Rough Riders before the 1988 season and went on to play in all 18 games. For the second time, he was nominated for the Leo Dandurand Trophy. In March 1989, incoming head coach Steve Goldman developed a long-term strategy for the Rough Riders that involved a focus on developing younger players. As part of his efforts, Goldman gave Allemang an ultimatum to retire or be released from the team, and Allemang announced his retirement later that month.  Later life  After retiring from football, Allemang became a tax investigator with Revenue Canada, the Canadian tax agency. In 1996, he became a firefighter in Ancaster, Ontario, a position from which he retired in 2013.

He is the captain of the kendo team where he reached the national championship tournament, and also excels in judo and karate. However, he harbors a secret: he is an otomen, a guy who really loves things that are usually associated with girls: cooking, sewing, and especially reading sh≈çjo manga love stories. He hides this part of his life from his classmates until he meets and falls in love with Ryo Miyakozuka, the daughter of a martial artist and heir to his dojo who appears to be interested in manly guys. He is encouraged by his schoolmate Juta Tachibana to pursue a relationship with her and for them to be honest with each other, but unbeknownst to him, Juta is secretly a shojo manga artist of Asuka's favorite manga. Characters=Main= ; : Asuka is a very tall, masculine and cool high school boy, but secretly, he loves all things related to girls (pink, sparkly and cute stuff, cooking, love comics, etc.). This, however, does not stop him from being necessarily tough on occasion- he can defend himself and his friends. When Asuka was young his father left his family because he wanted to become a woman. This affected Asuka's mother severely and when she saw that her son was starting to like girly things she forced him to be masculine. Asuka also clearly states that while he likes girly things, he does not want to become a woman. When a new girl in school, Ryo Miyakozuka, is being bullied he defends her and later falls in love with her. Among his talents, besides sports, are cooking and sewing. He also enjoys reading the fictional sh≈çjo manga Love Chick. : Author Aya Kanno has noted that Asuka has hobbies and sensitivities that are opposite of her own personal likes. She finds that it makes Asuka more naturally feminine. ; : Ryo is a new transfer student at Asuka's school. She lives with her father who is a very tough police officer, and of which owns their family dojo. Even though she is a girl, she cannot sew, cook, bake, make bento or do any other \\"girly\\" things with which Asuka helps her. She also likes action movies. : Author Aya Kanno notes that Ryo is the exact opposite of Asuka, but that Ryo has a different perspective on masculinity than Kanno likes. Kanno perceives her as \\"the extremely thick- skinned yet clueless cool boy in shojo manga\\". ; : A playboy who befriends Asuka and Ryo, and helps Asuka with his relationship with Ryo. Under the pen name Jewel Sachihana, he is actually the author of Asuka's favorite manga, , which runs in the magazine Hana to Mame, He first was inspired to model his Asuka girl character after Masamune when he saw the latter help out a child with a stuffed animal. As a result, his manga moved up from second place to first place in readership and related awards. Upon getting to know Ryo, he adds her to the manga as a guy, and tries to further their relationship whenever his story bogs down. : Juta is the only son and eldest in a family of 11 children. He was inspired to become a manga artist after meeting a girl who let him borrow a sh≈çjo manga. He ended up falling in love with her, only to find out that she was moving away. He promised to see her off, but by the time he got to her house, she was already gone, leaving him heart broken. He returned home to find the manga she loaned him, unread. He had forgotten about it and never gave it back. Juta reads it and falls in love with sh≈çjo manga. : Kanno notes that Juta was originally a cool character but gets more comedic after the third chapter, and he is a shojo manga artist through and through. She admires his passion for his work and notes that he is the most grounded of the three characters. ; :An underclassman at Asuka's school, Yamato has a very girly appearance which he hates. He loves martial arts and trains hard to become good. He admires manliness and has long delusional fantasies about being manly. He believes Asuka to be the ideal man and is oblivious to the fact that Asuka is an otomen. He falls in love with many different girls but is unable to get a girlfriend. Kanno notes that she initially had a difficult time keeping Yamato in the story as there were not many places where he could be used. ; :The captain of Kinbara High School's kendo team, he sees Asuka as his lifelong rival. He is the strong and silent type but is actually an otomen who is good with doing makeup. Similar to Asuka, Tonomine's father told him to give up his girly habits, fearing it would interfere with his Kendo. Juta calls him a \\"tsun-sama\\", a portmanteau of tsundere (cold on the outside, warm on the inside) and ore-sama (self-confident, narcissistic). In one story arc, he and Asuka are recruited to do makeovers for a local television show as masked characters called the Beauty Samurai. ; :Juta's classmate. He has a mysterious, somewhat threatening appearance thanks to his tall stature and bangs that cover his eyes. With his family running a flower shop, he has been obsessed with the beauty of flowers and covers everything from buildings to people with them. He was in a relationship with a girl but gave it up when she told him he had to choose between her and flowers. He is an otomen who refers to himself as the \\"flower evangelist\\". Kitora knows Juta's alter-ego as Jewel Sachihana, but protects it. =Supporting= ; Kiyomi Masamune : Asuka's mother. Traumatized by her husband's announcement that he always dreamed of being a woman, she takes many measures to ensure Asuka is very manly.

Her nickname is O-tan, and she is very popular among the boys. She tries to get Ryo to act more feminine but fails. However, she is surprised that Ryo has Asuka as a boyfriend, and that Asuka is a much better at girl activities than even herself. It is later revealed that when she was a student, she was a tomboy who was a member of the softball team and who did not do any housework. Her boyfriend at the time told her that she was not cute and broke up with her, prompting her to try extra hard at being feminine. After Asuka defends her when she encounters her ex, she agrees to part ways with her ex and lets Asuka continue with his otomen activities. She vows to wait for the right guy to love her for who she is, and to continue being an angel to the single boys. ; Kibino : A science teacher who is brought in by Kiyomi to reform the school. He has messy hair, wears science goggles and a mask that covers his mouth. He enjoys making inventions, but has gotten disheartened recently because the inventions are not getting much attention.

He intends to turn all the boys into manly samurai. He hosts a field trip at an Edo period themed town in which the boys have to act like samurai and the girls have to act like geisha.

Unlike schools in the public system, students at St. Ignatius are required to wear uniforms; the uniform consists of a white or burgundy crested top, a burgundy crested vest or a grey crested sweatshirt and a pair of solid-black bottoms.  History  St. Ignatius High School was originally built on 159 Clayte St in the early 1960s. However, in 1990 Lakeview High School (Lakehead District School Board) closed its doors as a public high school. Thunder Bay Catholic District School Board purchased the facility for only $1 in a government auction. The school was transferred to the newly purchased Lakeview High School facility while the Board converted the older Clayte St building into Bishop Gallagher Senior Elementary. In 2008 multiple renovations were added to the Lakeview building. This included a newly renovated cafeteria with an enclosed courtyard and also the addition of a new auditorium.

Early years Gray was born in Buffalo, New York, and graduated from Harvard University in 1892. He was a member of the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I; serving in France, he received the Croix de guerre and the Legion of Honour. In 1925, he received a Doctor of Letters from Bowdoin College. Minister to Ireland Gray was appointed minister to Ireland in February 1940, and presented his credentials in April 1940. His official title was Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. In Gray's own words, his appointment was nepotic, as he was First Lady's Eleanor Roosevelt's uncle through marriage. Gray was in his post through most of World War II and the start of the Cold War. He led American efforts to convince Ireland to enter the war on the side of the Allies. His performance was such that Ireland's Taoiseach (prime minister) √âamon de Valera sought repeatedly to have Gray replaced, especially after the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Gray believed Ireland was only staying neutral because de Valera actually believed the Nazis would eventually defeat the Allies. He also believed that top Irish officials were colluding with Nazi Germany secretly.http://www.ibtimes.com/irish- nationalist-nazi-when-eamon-de-valera-paid-his-respects-adolf-hitler-1403768 =Views on Ireland= As a Roosevelt family member, Gray wrote privately to Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt with a number of dry verses and remarks, sometimes humorous and sometimes scathing, on his opinions of de Valera and Irish policy towards the War. Senior lecturer in U.S. Foreign Policy, Timothy J. Lynch, has observed that \\"his animus towards his host nation made Gray atypical of American ambassadors in Dublin.\\" Gray, among other things, relied for guidance on seances conducted at the embassy residence, according to T. Ryle Dwyer, author of a number of publications on Irish neutrality. During World War II, Gray was completely at odds with the OSS in Ireland. Gray believed the Irish government was secretly pro-Nazi. Gray consistently tried to get Ireland to join the war against the Nazis, though Ireland refused. De Valera went so far as to ask the United States government and Franklin Roosevelt to remove Gray from his post because of opposition to Irish neutrality, though the U.S. government never did. =In popular culture= The character of David Gray was played in the 1983 RT√â television series Caught in a Free State by the actor O. Z. Whitehead. Later years Gray donated many of his personal papers to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library before his death, including an extensive correspondence. Gray died in Florida in 1968, aged 97.

In 1630 William Sutton of one of the foremost families in the area owned the property. In 1689 it was confiscated from Lord Kingston by the Earl of Tyrconnell after the accession of King James 11 of England. It then became the property of the Commissioners of the Revenue who leased it to Roger Kelly in the late 17th century. At the end of that century it passed through a number of hands, including Bartholomew Vanhomrigh who bought it for ¬£1,033 in 1703, together with 335 acres (135 hectares) of land. Vanhomrigh had been Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1697 and was the father of Vanessa, lover of Dean Swift. He sold it to the Henrys who forced by financial circumstances to sell it on to Hugh Barton of the wine family Barton and Guestier. He built the last wing of the house in the 1830s. (He also built Straffan House, known today at the K Club). In the 20th century it was sold by the Huddlestons to Mrs. Norah Devlin who converted it into a hotel in 1971. Eric Clapton purchased the property in 1979 and in 1987 sold it to the current owner, Ken Healy, who lives in the property. Healy has renovated it from a 10 bedroom guesthouse with three bathrooms to a 59 bedroom F√°ilte Ireland approved 4 Star Hotel.

Biography Dunn began his career with Christian Brothers College (CBC) of the St. Louis Municipal League, the city‚Äôs de facto second division.
