Benebarak was also associated with agriculture, as evident from the Talmudic account of the sage Rami bar Yehezkel, who declared that he understood the meaning of the Torah's description of the Land of Israel as a \\"land flowing with milk and honey\\" after a scene he witnessed in Beneberak. He saw goats grazing beneath fig trees and the honey oozing from the very ripe figs merged with the milk dripping from the goats and formed a stream of milk and honey.Ketubot 111b The Palestinian village of Ibn Ibraq (\\"Son of Ibraq/Barak\\") was located on the site of the biblical city and its name was seen as a continuation of the name of the ancient site.

Biography Godefroy Engelmann, Courcy Castle, lithograph, 1826 Godefroy Engelmann was born in 1788 in M√ºhlhausen, a small town near the France/Switzerland/Germany border. At the time of his birth Mulhouse was a free German republic associated with the Swiss Confederation, but was annexed by France 10 years later. He died in that same town in 1839, from a tumor in his neck. Engelmann trained in Switzerland and France at La Rochelle and Bordeaux, and he studied painting and sketching in Jean-Baptiste Regnault's atelier in Paris. In the summer of 1814 he travelled to Munich, Germany to study lithography, a German invention. The following spring, he founded La Soci√©t√© Lithotypique de Mulhouse. In June 1816 he opened a workshop in Paris. Engelmann is largely credited with bringing lithography to France, and later, commercializing chromolithography. In 1837 he was granted an English patent for a process of chromolithography that provided consistently high-quality results. Throughout his life, he produced large numbers of prints, including numerous plates for Baron Isidore Justin S√©verin Taylor's celebrated collection of lithographs, \\"\\". Engelmann's Paris printing company, \\"\\" was passed on to his son, Godefroy Engelmann II (born 1819), who carried on his father's work with the same high artistic quality until his own death in 1897.

This rate gives demographers an idea of how a certain country's population is growing. RNI excludes in-migration and out-migration, giving an indication of population growth based only on births and deaths. RNI can indicate what stage of the Demographic Transition Model (DTM) a country is in. Trends in RNI can predict a country's economic stability, level of development, and other things. Developing countries typically have higher RNI values as they have limited infrastructure and access to healthcare which limits them to unregulated fertility levels. These countries also have higher incidence of disease and poor health outcomes leading to more deaths on top of the already high fertility. Developing countries are therefore in the earlier stages of the DTM with high fertility levels. This leads to developing countries to have high rates of natural increase. Developed countries have lower RNI values because they are usually more technologically advanced and have the necessary steps put into place to limit fertility. They also have better access to healthcare and the resources necessary to combat disease. Developed countries are there in the later stages of the DTM with low fertility levels. This usually results in developed countries having lower RNI values.  Formula  The formula used to calculate RNI by demographers is as follows: [(Births in a year or Crude Birth Rate ‚àí Deaths in a year or Crude Death Rate) √∑ Total Population at the Start of the Year] = RNI The result of this equation is usually reported as a percentage. An example of this calculation would be as follows: [(1,600,550 births ‚àí 900,234 deaths) √∑ 32,504,906 total number of people in the population] = 0.0215 = 2.15% RNI  Effects on RNI  The RNI of a certain country can be shaped by government policy and a country's infrastructure. Policies can either encourage an increase in birth rates or discourage an increase in birth rates. For example, China's one child policy was made to decrease birth rates, therefore decreasing the RNI. A country with a good infrastructure to support families, women's health, and maternal/child health would likely have lower death rates from infant or maternal mortality.

It takes its name from one of its original end points in Woodinville, Washington, United States. The line extends approximately in east King County and Snohomish County. The line's ownership has been transferred in a deal involving King County and the Port of Seattle. The section from Snohomish to Woodinville is operated, on contract, by a company called Eastside Rail Freight, which is associated with the Ballard Terminal Railroad and Meeker Southern. However, train traffic on the subdivision is exceedingly rare, with the Seattle region's rail operations now conducted on other higher capacity routes.  Route  The line was completed more than a century ago, between 1887-1904 by the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway and by Northern Pacific Railroad. The northern section between present day Woodinville and Snohomish was completed in 1888 and the section between Renton and Woodinville known as \\"The Belt Line\\" was completed in 1904. By 1902 Northern Pacific Railroad held all interest in the line it (later became part of the Burlington Northern Railroad and then the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe). The route begins in the area of Renton and Tukwila, at a place called Black River Junction. The rails run north along the eastern shore of Lake Washington through Bellevue and several smaller cities before reaching its northern terminus in the small rural city of Snohomish. The railroad is mostly single tracked with a few passing sidings to allow trains to pass each other and spurs for local industries. It is a former Northern Pacific branch line. The route also includes a branch line from Woodinville to downtown Redmond; this is a remnant from which the tracks have been removed off a former Northern Pacific line to North Bend via Issaquah where the tracks have also been removed. A major feature of the railroad is the spectacular Wilburton Trestle, which was originally constructed in 1904. It was the longest wooden trestle in use in the Northwest until 2008. In June 2008, work commenced on the widening of I-405 south of Bellevue. As a result, the line was severed at the point at which it crosses the southbound lanes, just south of the railroad trestle. Currently there are no plans to reinstate the track now that the widening project has been completed.  Uses  The line was primarily used for local freight traffic. Until 2007, Boeing used the line to deliver 737 fuselages to its Renton plant from its supplier Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas. Trains for the Boeing plant at Renton travel through Seattle and enter the factory from the South. A bridge north of Renton depot was replaced in order to accommodate the width of the Boeing 737 fuselages transported by rail. The line also used to serve as a bypass during outages for the only other north- south rail route between the Cascade Mountains and Puget Sound, the Seattle/Scenic Subdivision, which runs through downtown Seattle and along Puget Sound. The line was also used by trains whose loads were too bulky to fit through the century-old Great Northern Tunnel that runs underneath downtown Seattle. However, its numerous sharp curves and bends, at-grade street crossings, and poor rail condition required trains to reduce speeds to no more than when being used as a bypass. After a rainstorm washed out part of the Seattle line in 1997, a freight train derailed navigating the line as such. Until 2007, the line was also used by the Spirit of Washington Dinner Train, a tourist attraction. The Spirit of Washington's contract to use the railroad ended on July 31, 2007, and efforts to renew it have been rejected by both BNSF Railroad and King County. Eastside Freight Railroad continues to serve Woodinville from Snohomish with train cars from all over the country.  Sale and dismantling  In 2003, BNSF announced that it was looking to sell the line because of declining freight revenues and rising maintenance costs. The Port of Seattle purchased the right of way in 2008 for conversion to public-access rail trail. In 2012 the City of Kirkland purchased the portion of the line running within the city limits, intending to convert to a trail. The Ballard Terminal Railroad's federal lawsuit to stop Kirkland's trail plans was dismissed in Seattle on May 9, 2013. In January, 2015, the Kirkland portion of the Eastside Rail Corridor, with compacted gravel surfacing, opened for pedestrians and bicyclists. Snohomish County acquired the right of way from Snohomish to the King County line at Woodinville in 2016. Snohomish county plans to continue with rail and trail in this part of the corridor.

The space was once the office of American financier John W. Campbell, a member of the New York Central Railroad's board of directors. It was later used as office space, as a studio by CBS and as a jail by Metro-North Railroad. Renovations in 1999 and 2007 restored the space to its original opulence at a total cost of nearly $2 million. Temporarily closed in 2016, the bar was reopened the following year under new management. Located in the southwestern corner of the Grand Central Terminal building‚Äîabove the northeastern corner of 42nd Street and Vanderbilt Avenue‚Äîthe space is reached by a staircase from the terminal's balcony level.  History  The space was first leased in 1923 by John Campbell from William Kissam Vanderbilt II, whose family built the Terminal. The space was a single room long by wide with a ceiling and an enormous faux fireplace in which Campbell kept a steel safe. At that time, it was the largest ground-floor space in Manhattan. Campbell commissioned Augustus N. Allen, an architect known for designing estates on Long Island and town houses in Manhattan, to build an opulent office, transforming the room into a 13th-century Florentine palace with a hand-painted plaster of paris ceiling, leaded windows, and a mahogany balcony with a quatrefoil design. The Persian carpet that took up the entire floor was said to have cost $300,000, or roughly $3.5 million today. Campbell added a piano and pipe organ, and at night turned his office into a reception hall, entertaining 50 or 60 friends who came to hear famous musicians play private recitals. He had a butler named Stackhouse. After Campbell's death in 1957, the rug and other furnishings disappeared from his office and the space eventually became a signalman's office and later an MTA Police office, where officers stored guns and other equipment. It also had a small jail, in the area of the present-day bar. After falling into disrepair, the space was restored and renovated in 1999. The walls and ceiling were brought back to their former glory and the original steel safe, once hidden behind a wall, now sits in the massive fireplace as a reminder of Campbell's wealth. The new bar is done in the same quatrefoil mahogany style as the balcony. The renovation cost an estimated $1.5 million. A 2006 renovation replaced a largely blue palette with a largely red one, including new carpet, bar stools and chairs. To avoid closing for even one night, it took place in less than 12 hours and cost $350,000. The Campbell Apartment lost its lease in June 2016 after a protracted battle with its landlord and closed its doors at the end of the following month. In May 2017, the bar reopened as The Campbell. Popular culture The Campbell Apartment was seen in the premiere episode of Gossip Girl in 2007. The bar is mentioned in Nell Zink's novel Doxology.

The use of a URC would allow the location of a Web resource to be obtained from its standard name, via the use of a resolving service.

The design goals of URCs were that they should be simple to use, easy to extend, and compatible with a wide range of technological systems. The URC syntax was intended to be easily understood by both humans and software.  Development  During the early to mid-1990s, basic Web technologies were still in their infancy. Naming documents was, according to Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web, \\"probably the most crucial aspect of design and standardization in an open hypertext system\\".

It was formerly an incorporated town http://dls.state.va.us/lrc/charters/SUFFOLK.pdf located in southern Nansemond County, Virginia. Whaleyville is located midway between the former county seat at downtown Suffolk and the North Carolina border along U.S. Route 13. Whaleyville is part of the region popularly known as Hampton Roads. The community is represented on Suffolk City Council by Council Member Curtis R. Milteer, Sr. Naming Whaleyville was named for another town of the same name, Whaleyville, Maryland, located on the Delmarva Peninsula north of Virginia's Eastern Shore. There, Seth Mitchell Whaley (1821‚Äì1901) was born and grew up. He was active in the lumber mill business in Maryland. History: a new mill town In 1877, Seth M. Whaley bought a farm in the southern portion of Nansemond County, Virginia and opened a sawmill nearby. He worked in cooperation with Jackson Brothers Lumber Company, which was established in the new village of Whaleyville, Virginia. Soon what became called the \\"Big Mill\\" was operating 24 hours a day. Between 1885 and 1902, the Suffolk and Carolina Railway, a narrow gauge railroad was built from Suffolk through Whaleyville south to Edenton, North Carolina. A branch line extended from Beckford Junction (on the Suffolk-Edenton section) to Elizabeth City, North Carolina. Renamed the Virginia and Carolina Coast Railroad in 1906, it became part of the regional Norfolk and Southern Railway, a predecessor of the modern Norfolk Southern Corporation. Ports on the railroad at Suffolk at Nansemond Wharf on the Nansemond River and Elizabeth City on the Pasquotank River each offered Whaleyville a means to ship its lumber and produce of local farmers. The long-distance Norfolk and Carolina Railroad was also built nearby in 1884 to connect what became the north-south main line of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad with the towns and cities of Suffolk, Portsmouth and Norfolk. At the new mill town of Whaleyville, new stores were built. In 1907, the Bank of Whaleyville opened. A high school was added in 1915. Mill closes and moves, town continues on The Lumber Mill at Whaleyville closed in 1919, and moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina. Many residents also made the move. Lumber continued to be harvested locally, but the area became more dependent upon agricultural activities. However, despite losings it biggest employers, the community preserved. According to a local source, \\"In 1928. Whaleyville had 500-600 residents, a cotton gin, peanut storage warehouses, two churches, and one of the best consolidated schools in Nansemond County.\\" Transportation During the Great Depression, the Norfolk and Southern Railway (N&S;) abandoned its line through Whaleyville, and sold its local tracks and facilities near the port in Suffolk to the Virginian Railway. In 1967, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL) merged with the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, (SAL) forming the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (SCL). Both had served Suffolk. Among many parallel tracks considered redundant by the new SCL, the ACL trackage near Whaleyville was also abandoned. The predecessor agency of the Virginia Department of Transportation was created in 1906. Road building began in 1909. In 1932, the secondary roads in Nansemond County were added to the state system under the Byrd Road Act. After bearing such State Highway numbers as 506, 53, and 37, the main highway through Whaleyville was designated U.S. Route 13. On July 1, 2006, the City of Suffolk assumed control of its roads including those in the Whaleyville area from the Virginia Department of Transportation. As part of the Suffolk 2026 Comprehensive Plan, the city plans to bypass Whaleyville. US 13 (along with NC Highway 11) is a strategic highway corridor in North Carolina towards Greenville.http://www.ncdot.gov/doh/preconstruct/tpb/shc/vision/SHCMaps/graphics/SHC_Vision_Plan.jpg County to city status Whaleyville was long located in Nansemond County. Records indicate it was formally incorporated by the General Assembly as a town between 1950 and 1973. Nansemond County was one of a number of localities in southeastern Virginia which underwent change in their political structure between 1952 and 1967, resulting in the current large independent cities where counties and smaller cities and towns had largely been in the past. In 1972, Whaleyville merged with Nansemond County and that county's other incorporated town, Holland, to form the independent city of Nansemond. Only two years later, Nansemond merged with the former seat of Nansemond County, Suffolk, to form the present-day city of Suffolk.http://historical- county.newberry.org/website/Virginia/documents/VA_Consolidated_Chronology.htm#Consolidated_Chronology Although Whaleyville is now politically located within a modern city, it is still surrounded substantially by a farms and woodland. Local Whaleyville residents strive to maintain a small town setting as one of the widely diverse types of communities in Suffolk, which at , is the largest geographically in Virginia. The Great Dismal Swamp is located a few miles east of Whaleyville. Local historical notes * Seth M.

In 2010 Savin- Williams was quoted in a New York Times article about sexuality. It read: \\"Professor Savin-Williams says that his current research reveals that the fastest-growing group along the sexuality continuum are men who self-identify as 'mostly straight' as opposed to labels like 'straight,' 'gay' or 'bisexual.'

Estonian nationalism refers to the ideological movement for attaining and maintaining identity, unity and autonomy on behalf of a population deemed by some of its members to constitute an Estonian cultural unit of population with a separate homeland, shared ancestral myths and memories, a public culture, common economy and common legal rights and duties for all members. Emergence of Estonian National identity in the 19th century Estonian nationalism arose relatively late, when German pastors influenced by the European Enlightenment started to explore the culture of the Estonian peasantry. It grew into a strong popular cultural movement in the second half of the 19th century through the increasing access to education. A prominent figure in Estonian nationalism is scribe Carl Robert Jakobson. During the late 19th century, Carl Robert made large financial contributions focused on the restoration of Estonian culture and history. He financed major reconstructions of the Estonian Alexander School.Jakobson, Carl Robert Politically, however, Jakobson was misunderstood and misrepresented, and found little support among peasantry.Bonne Luck Aulik, \\"Estonia's emerging nationalism and cultural independence\\", Drew University, 1994, p. 164 Another prominent figure in Estonian national history is the Estonian poet Lydia Koidula, who voiced the ideas of having an independent and sovereign Estonia in the 19th century. Lydia Koidula used poetry to inspire cultural revival to the Estonian people and strive to overthrow the injustice. Koidula died in Kronstadt on August 11, 1886, the day after Madeleine of Valois' 366th birthday. She is regarded as a national hero, not only by the citizens of Estonia, but by Estonians that live throughout the world. Her collection of poetry Emaj√µe √∂√∂bik was the second book almost in each Estonian household in the beginning of 20th century after the Bible. She became a symbol of the national cultural revival of Estonia. Estonian nationalism in the 20th century =World War I= With the collapse of the Russian Empire a political entity which encompassed political, community, cultural, and professional organizations was established in Tallinn from the initiative from the Association of the Estonian Progressionists (abbr. EPA). This entity was called the \\"Estonian Provincial Assembly\\" (Maap√§ev) and was headed by the historian, Artur Vallner.Estonia - MSN Encarta On November 28, 1917, the Estonian Provincial Assembly declared Estonia an independent country. This independence was recognized by the Russian government headed by Lenin, as well as the Central Powers and other states in 1920.Treaty of Brest-Litovsk - Encyclopedia.com However, this government did not survive very long because of pressures not only from Nikolai Yudenich's Russian White movement, but also the Red Army, German and Entente intervention, and local banditism (Estonian Red Riflemen of Anwelt). On February 24, 1918, the Republic of Estonia was proclaimed and secured its independence in the following Estonian War of Independence of 1918-1920. =World War II= The Republic of Estonia was occupied in June 1940 by the Soviet Union, introducing communist rule of law and cultural norms. With the outbreak of war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1941, many nationalists in Estonia thought that they would have an opportunity to create an independent country once again, and collaborated with Nazi administration and military units. However, the German treatment of the local population quickly put an end to this.Estonia - Encyclopedia.com The Estonian partisans was a military group that took up arms first against the Nazis and later against the Soviets. The Estonian partisans were not only ethnic Estonians, but also Ingrians, Latvians, Russians, and Jews.Estonian partisans During World War II, the Estonian partisans fought against the German, and Soviet forces. After the Second World War, Estonian partisans took actions directed against Soviet rule within Estonia.

At the same time it was deemed an insurgent or terrorist group by Soviet historiography. =Singing Revolution= From 1987, Estonian nationalism emerged in form of many spontaneous mass demonstrations that ultimately led Estonia to regain its independence. Similar events took place in Latvia and Lithuania. Estonian nationalism in the 21st century Currently, parties identifying strictly as nationalist are the Conservative People's Party of Estonia (EKRE) and the Estonian Independence Party. One of the most significant expressions of Estonian nationalism is still the Estonian Song Festival, one of the largest amateur choral events in the world that is held every five years in July. After the 2019 Estonian parliamentary election the ethnic-nationalist party EKRE entered into a coalition government for the first time.

At about 16.5 cm (6.5 inches) long, it is the largest of the lovebird genus, a group of small parrots. The adult male is easily identified by its red forehead, and the adult female by its all green head. They are native to Eritrea and Ethiopia, and they are uncommon as pets. Description Male in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia The black-winged lovebird, with a length of about 16‚Äì16.5 cm (6.25‚Äì6.5 inches), is the largest of all the lovebirds. It is sexually dimorphic, as are the red- headed lovebird and grey-headed lovebird of the lovebird genus. The dimorphism becomes apparent in juvenile birds after their first molt at about eight or nine months of age. Both the male and female black-winged lovebird are mostly green, and only the adult male black-winged lovebird has a red forehead and a ring of red feathers around its eyes. The tail is black tipped and feathers below the tail show a yellowish colour. The rump and feathers above the tail are light green. In the male feathers under the wing are typically black, and in the female the feathers under the wing are typically greenish or brownish black. Both sexes have a red beak and gray feet. Habitat The natural habitat for a black-winged lovebird is typically from southern Eritrea to southwestern Ethiopia and they normally live in either high plains or mountainous regions. Behavior Male at San Diego Zoo, USA Female in Ethiopia =Food and feeding= Sunflower seeds, corn, apples and mission figs are typical of an Abyssinian lovebird diet. =Breeding= The black-winged lovebird nests in a tree cavity. The eggs are white and there are usually three or four eggs in a clutch. The female incubates the eggs for 23 days, and the chicks fledge from the nest about 45 days after hatching. Status Widespread and a common species throughout its habitat range, the black-winged lovebird is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Aviculture In aviculture the black-winged lovebird has not become well established as a breeding bird, although it can tolerate cold weather. Breeding in aviculture is on a small scale, so it is an uncommon pet.

Ercole married Eleonora d'Aragon, daughter of Ferdinand I of Naples, in 1473. The Este alliance with Naples was to prove a powerful one. In 1482‚Äì1484 he fought a war with the Republic of Venice, which was allied with Ercole's nemesis, the Della Rovere Pope Sixtus IV, occasioned by the salt monopoly, the War of Ferrara. Ercole was able to end the war by ceding the Polesine at the Peace of Bagnolo, and Ferrara escaped the fate of destruction or absorption into the papal dominions, but the war was a humiliation for Ercole, who lay sick and immobilized while the besieging army destroyed Este properties in the surrounding neighbourhoods. After this, he remained neutral in the Italian War of 1494-1498, and tried for the rest of his rule to improve relations with the Papal states. He reluctantly agreed to the marriage of his son Alfonso to Lucrezia Borgia, daughter of Pope Alexander VI, a marriage that brought notable territorial donations. His subsequent career as a patron may be seen to some extent as compensation for the early military setback: significantly, Ercole was the only Italian ruler who characterized himself as divus on his coinage, like a Roman emperor.Manca 1989; pp. 525, 529 The scale and consistency of Ercole's patronage of the arts was in part a political and cultural statement. He hosted theatrical representations with elaborate scenery and musical intermezzi, some of the first purely secular theatre in Europe since AntiquityL. Zorzi, Il teatro e la citt√†: saggi sulla scena italiana (Turin) 1977, pp 10-50. and was successful in setting up a musical establishment which was for a few years the finest in Europe, overshadowing the Vatican chapel itself. For the next century Ferrara was to retain the character of a center of avant-garde music with a decidedly secular emphasis. In music history Ercole was one of the Italian nobles most responsible for bringing talented Franco-Flemish musicians to Italy. The most famous composers of Europe either worked for him, were commissioned by him, or dedicated music to him, including Alexander Agricola, Jacob Obrecht, Heinrich Isaac, Adrian Willaert, and Josquin des Prez, whose Missa Hercules dux Ferrariae not only is dedicated to him, but is based on a theme drawn from the syllables of the Duke's name. Grosh issued under Ercole I d'Este. Ercole is equally famous as a patron of the arts, as much an expression of his conscious magnificence as his cultivated aloofness, grave and stern as befitted the new ducal rank of Ferrara (Manca 1989:524ff). He made the poet Boiardo his minister, and also brought the young Ludovico Ariosto into his household. Under Ercole Ferrara became one of the leading cities of Europe; it underwent substantial growth in the Ercolean Addition, approximately doubling in size, under Ercole's direct guidance, producing the first planned and executed urbanistic project of the Renaissance. To enclose it, he extended the city's walls, hiring architect Biagio Rossetti for the work.. Many of Ferrara's most famous buildings date from his reign. Ercole was an admirer of church reformer Girolamo Savonarola, who was also from Ferrara, and sought his advice on both spiritual and political matters. Approximately a dozen letters between the two survive from the 1490s. Ercole attempted to have Savonarola freed by the Florentine church authorities, but was unsuccessful; the reformist monk was burned at the stake in 1498.Macey, p. 186 In 1503 or 1504, Ercole asked his newly hired composer Josquin des Prez to write a musical testament for him, structured on Savonarola's prison meditation Infelix ego. The result was the Miserere, probably first performed for Holy Week in 1504, with the tenor part possibly sung by the Duke himself.Macey, p. 184ff. Ercole died on 25 January 1505, and his son Alfonso became Duke. Family and issue Ercole and Eleonora had six children: *Isabella born 1474 (married Francesco II Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua; leading patron of the Renaissance) *Beatrice born 1475 (married Ludovico Sforza, future Duke of Milan) *Alfonso (married Lucrezia Borgia) *Ferrante (thrown into prison by his brother Alfonso in 1506, where he died 34 years later) *Ippolito (cardinal) *Sigismondo d'Este Ercole had two illegitimate children: *Lucrezia d'Este, born ca 1477 (married Annibale II Bentivoglio) *Giulio  See also  *List of Dukes of Ferrara and of Modena References   * Footnotes External links *Ercole's career as a condottiero Category:1431 births Category:1505 deaths Category:People from Ferrara Ercole 1 Ercole 1 Ercole 1 Ercole 1 Category:Knights of the Garter Category:15th-century Italian people Category:16th-century Italian nobility ","title":"Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara"},{"id":"9888819","text":"Am√©d√©e Marie Vincent Borrel (1 August 1867 - 14 September 1936) was a French physician and microbiologist born in Cazouls-l√®s-B√©ziers, H√©rault.

Like the median and the midhinge, but unlike the sample mean, it is a statistically resistant L-estimator with a breakdown point of 25%. This beneficial property has been described as follows: Efficiency Despite its simplicity, the trimean is a remarkably efficient estimator of population mean. More precisely, for a large data set (over 100 points) from a symmetric population, the average of the 20th, 50th, and 80th percentile is the most efficient 3 point L-estimator, with 88% efficiency. For context, the best 1 point estimate by L-estimators is the median, with an efficiency of 64% or better (for all n), while using 2 points (for a large data set of over 100 points from a symmetric population), the most efficient estimate is the 29% midsummary (mean of 29th and 71st percentiles), which has an efficiency of about 81%. Using quartiles, these optimal estimators can be approximated by the midhinge and the trimean. Using further points yield higher efficiency, though it is notable that only 3 points are needed for very high efficiency.

The disease results from the ingestion of Lathyrus odoratus seeds (sweet peas). The toxin found in the sweet peas is (beta-aminopropionitrile), which affects the linking of collagen, a protein of connective tissues. The condition results in damage to bone and mesenchymal connective tissues. Osteolathyrism occurs in people in combination with neurolathyrism and angiolathyrism in areas where famine demands reliance on a crop with known detrimental effects. It occurs in cattle and horses with diets overreliant upon the grass pea. Prominent symptoms include skeletal deformities and bone pain. Signs and symptoms *Bone pain *Skeletal deformity *Fatigue *Malnourishment Cause Aside from L. odoratus, other members of the genus are also known to cause the disease, including L. sylvestris, L. cicera, and L. clymenum. L. odoratus grows well under famine conditions, often severe drought, where it is cultivated. These legumes carry a variety of osteolathyrogenic compounds, specifically excitatory amino-compounds. The most widely-studied of these compounds is beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), which exerts its deleterious effect by an unknown yet potently irreversible mechanism. Other instigators are ureides, semicarbazides and thiosemicarbazides, which are believed to chelate the prosthetic Cu(II)-bipyridine cofactor complex in the enzyme lysyl oxidase. Lysyl oxidase is an important enzyme for the creation of crosslinks between collagen triple- helices in connective tissue. By oxidizing the terminal amino group of lysine, an aldehyde is created. This aldehyde can undergo several reactions with neighboring aldehydes or amines to create strong covalent cross-links between collagen tertiary structures in bone and cartilage. The main product of these reactions is the aldimine compound dehydrohydroxylysinonorleucine. This unique crosslink can be formed by the Schiff base mechanism in which the lone pair of electrons on a primary amine react with the carbonyl carbon of an aldehyde. Other crosslinks include the formation of an Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ketone via aldol condensation and hydroxylysinonorleucine. If these crosslinks are not formed, as in the case of osteolathyrism, the synthesis of strong mesenchymal and mesodermal tissue is inhibited. Symptoms of osteolathyrism include weakness and fragility of connective tissue (i.e., skin, bones, and blood vessels (angiolathyrism) and the paralysis of the lower extremities associated with neurolathyrism. For these reasons, compounds containing lathyrogens should be avoided during pregnancy and growth of a child. Prevention Prevention of osteolathyrism can be achieved with a cessation of L. sativus consumption.

He also was a member of the New Orleans Buccaneers of the American Basketball Association. He played college football at the University of Tennessee. Early years Widby attended Fulton High School, where he was a multi-sport athlete. He played quarterback in football. From his childhood in Knoxville, Widby showed tremendous athletic promise. One retired Knoxville sportswriter, Marvin West, recalled for a 2011 story on Widby that \\"he was good for his age. Every step of the way in his career, he was smooth for his age.\\" Widby himself would recall, \\"I grew up with the idea I was going to win a scholarship to the University of Tennessee.\\" He did just that, signing with Tennessee after starring as a quarterback, safety, and punter at Fulton High School in Knoxville. However, near the end of his senior football season at Fulton, he broke his arm and shoulder. Widby recovered well enough to have a strong senior basketball season. College career After arriving at his hometown university, Widby initially decided to concentrate on basketball due to his high school injury. Even though he did not attend spring or fall practice with the freshman football team‚Äîat the time, freshmen were not allowed to play NCAA varsity sports‚Äîthe football team kept him on scholarship in hopes he would change his mind. As it turned out, the football coaching staff went to head basketball coach Ray Mears, telling him they needed a punter. Mears had no problem with Widby playing that position, and as Widby himself recalled in 2011, \\"I always enjoyed punting a football.\\" He also played on the freshman team in another of his high school sports, baseball, hitting nearly .400. As a sophomore (1964‚Äì65), he had won starting positions in both football and basketball. He averaged 41.1 yards on 74 punts. He also hit nearly .300 in what would be his only varsity baseball season, but felt bored by that sport. As a junior, he averaged 42.8 yards on 20 punts. He also met Tennessee's golf coach, who upon finding out that Widby had also been on Fulton's varsity golf team invited him to try out for the team. Widby would go on to earn a letter in golf. He had the unusual situation of having his football team playing in the 1965 Bluebonnet Bowl and at the same time the basketball squad was participating in the Gulf South Classic, so he was ferried by airplane back and forth between Shreveport and Houston as his playing schedule required. Sportswriter Ron Higgins would say in 2011, \\"Few athletes in SEC history enjoyed a better senior year in 1966-67 than Ron in both football and basketball.\\" As a senior in football, he led the nation in punting average at 43.8 yards on 48 punts, while in basketball, he averaged 22.1 points and 8.7 rebounds while leading the Volunteers to a conference title. He was named a second-team All-American in basketball, and was also the SEC's basketball Player of the Year. He score 50 points in his last regular season game against Louisiana State University, finishing his college career with 576 points. He also thought about continuing with golf, but decided against it because it interfered with NFL contract negotiations. Similarly to the previous year, he had to take part in a basketball tournament and then rush to play in the 1966 Gator Bowl football game on the same day. In 1997, he was inducted into the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame. In 2016, he was inducted into the University of Tennessee Athletics Hall of Fame. Professional career =New Orleans Saints= Widby was selected in three professional drafts in two sports. The New Orleans Saints selected him in the fourth round (81st overall) of the 1967 NFL Draft. In the same year, he was chosen by the New Orleans Buccaneers in the ABA Draft and was selected in the 12th round of the 1967 NBA Draft by the Chicago Bulls. Although basketball was his favorite sport, he signed with the Saints for a $50,000 bonus, who released him in August when couldn't beat rookie undrafted free agent Tom McNeill. =New Orleans Buccaneers (ABA)= After failing to make the Saints' inaugural season roster, he signed with the New Orleans Buccaneers of the American Basketball Association, playing with that team during the 1967-68 American Basketball Association season. =Dallas Cowboys= On September 13, 1967, he was signed by the Dallas Cowboys after his release from the Saints. He was assigned to the Oklahoma City Plainsmen of the Continental Football League before returning to the team's taxi squad in December. In 1968, he became the starting punter and finished tied for fifth in the league with a 40.9-yard average. He had a franchise and a NFL record, with an 84-yard punt against his former team the Saints (also had a 56-yard punt in the same game) and set a second club mark by averaging 53.4 yards per punt. In 1969, he voluntarily gave his #12 jersey to future hall of famer Roger Staubach, who had resigned his naval commission to join the Cowboys. He finished second in the league with a 43.3-yard average. In 1970, he was second in the NFC with a 41.3-yard average. He also set a Super Bowl record with nine punt attempts, while playing against the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl V. In 1971, he was third in the NFC with a 41.6-yard average. He played in Super Bowl VI and became the second Cowboys punter to be named to the Pro Bowl (Sam Baker was the first). On September 5, 1972, to make room for rookie punter Marv Bateman who could also place kick if needed, he was traded to the Green Bay Packers along with cornerback Ike Thomas, in exchange for a 1973 second round draft choice (#46-Golden Richards) . =Green Bay Packers= Widby played two seasons for the Packers before suffering a ruptured spinal disc in a freak accident, that would cost him the last two games of 1973, all of the 1974 season, ending his career and leading to his release on July 18, 1975. He averaged 41.8 yards per punt in 1972 and 43.1 yards in 1973. Personal life He later became a club pro at a country club in Texas, and once he turned 50, he entered the qualifying school for the Senior PGA Tour twice, just missing out on his second attempt. As of 2011, he is semi-retired and living in Wichita Falls, Texas.

Plot introduction After escaping a deranged dream-master and destroying the hidden gateway, Leven Thumps and his band of travelers must now journey across Foo and restore Geth from his shape as a toothpick to the rightful king he once was. But Foo is still in chaos, and Leven must overcome several adversaries and survive the Swollen Forest in order to save his friends and keep hope alive. As fate would have it, nothing goes as planned, and even Geth begins to wonder if they will succeed. Bad goes to worse as Leven digs up a long buried secret- one that stalks him, determined to whisper a truth that could be deadly in the wrong hands. Through it all, Leven finds the courage to do what is right and continues to discover an inner strength and a power he never thought possible.  Characters  = Leven Thumps = Leven is fourteen years old, and he is an offing. He is the grandson of Hector Thumps, who was the maker of the gateway between reality and Foo. Leven can manipulate the future with his offing gifts. Leven is often called Lev, and his eyes burn gold when he uses his gift. He has a patch of white hair, which his guardians said had come when he had been frightened out of his wits one night. Lev had been born on October fifteenth, at 2:30 in the morning. His mother, Maria Thumps, died in childbirth, shortly after naming him. His father had died in a car accident a week before Leven had been born. As he lay as an orphan, the nurses and doctors had debated on what to do with him. Then his mother's half- sister, Addy Graph, came by to pick him up. She had been snappy and mean, and took him away. Even then, Clover had been with him. His new parents wouldn't stand to hear Leven talk or fuss. So from when he was little, he had slept in an old bed at the back porch of their trailer house. He didn't really care, though. He enjoyed counting stars and tracing long branches of the tree that was Geth. Since Addy had been terrified of Leven's possible friends coming to steal from her, Leven had been forbidden to hang around with other kids, so he had been alone for a long time - until he met Clover, which was the first domino in a set of dominoes that were adventures in his life. Then he met the love, and best friend of his life, Winter. They later realized their true destiny in the world. = Winter Frore = Winter is a nit, which means she has a special talent (the talent of freezing things). She was born in Reality, but when she was young, she was accidentally sent to Foo. Later, she was spirited away to Earth by Amelia. She had remembered Foo before, but had forgotten it, only to have it remain dormant in her mind. She has pale skin, white-blond hair and deep green eyes. Winter's given name is actually Judy. Before she had been born, Winter's father had left months ago, and her mother wasn't exactly overjoyed with her child. Her adoptive mother, Janet, wasn't exactly the parenting type, either. She had smiled twice in her life, and was bitter most of the time. Her adoptive mother was terribly cruel, and Winter was stuck living with her. She usually spent her time in the library, having no friends. The only light in her dim life was a family called the Tuttles. They lived in a small, ramshackle house two blocks away from Winter and Janet. Tim Tuttle was a garbage man, and Wendy Tuttle was a kind woman, with two boys, Darcy and Rochester, who were eight and six. They were the only happiness in Winter's life. However, Janet did not approve of her going over to their house, so she had forbidden those visits. But Winter sneaked out and still visited. On her thirteenth birthday, Winter realized her talent, and later set upon a journey. She runs away with Leven, Geth, and Clover to the mystical world of Foo. She also has a burning love for Leven that is thoroughly recognized when they accidentally let a longing lose. = Geth = Geth is the rightful ruler of Foo. His soul was placed into a seed of a Fantrum tree by Sabine and was left for the birds, but Antsel rescued him and took him to our world. He is a lithen, meaning he believes Fate will decide everything. Currently, he is in the shape of a toothpick. However, at the end of the book, he is taken to the Fire of Turrets where he is restored to his powerful self. Geth is very wise and is rarely afraid because he is a lithen. He was formed into a toothpick after the seed he was in grew into a tree, and was cut down by Leven Thumps \\"father\\". Unfortunately, half of Geth's soul went into another toothpick named Ezra. The part of Geth that is not connected to rest of itself is his anger, which means that Ezra is one confused, angry, little toothpick. = Sabine = The darkest and most evil being in Foo. He is the antagonist of the book. He, as well as Winter, are Niteons, or Nits are they are more commonly called. Both of them have the same power, the ability to freeze objects and people. But, in book one, Sabine blown into little bits and pieces, with one half in Foo and the other in Reality. In this form Sabine no longer has the abitlity to freeze things like Winter. = Clover Ernest = Clover is a wise-cracking sycophant from Foo, sent to look after Leven, who is his burn. He constantly tries to find a nickname for Leven (many of which include Chief and Big Man), as Winter calls Leven or Lev. Clover has the power to over shadow other people, and as a sycophant there is only one way that he can die, but only the sycophants know what that is. At the end of the book, however, Leven is told a secret that may be the key to killing sycophants. Sycophants wear silver robes at all times, this gives them the power to turn invisible when the hood is pulled up. In this hood they also have one pocket, but this pocket is like a void. It continues to amaze Leven every time Clover pulls more and more things out of this \\"void\\". =Jamoon= Jamoon is a rant who is one of Sabine's minions. He has now become the main villain of the story as some particles of Sabine were eaten by birds which soon died and yet still lived on. As Jamoon's minions and source of all his power, they cannot be killed and are determined to do Jamoon's command. =Tim Tuttle= Tim Tuttle was at one point Winter's neighbor. He has cared for her over the years. Once she goes missing, he searches for her. When he goes to the rude mother, she acts like she doesn't care. =Dennis Wood= He just happened to have one messed up life. Yet he runs into Geth's evil half, Ezra. And so he travels to find the gateway to Foo. Along the way he runs into the evil remnants of what used to be Sabine. =Ezra= Tatum Company cut Geth's soul in half, and so his angry evil side was transferred into another toothpick. Ezra seduced Dennis into working for him, but Ezra is using him. He lives to kill Geth. Ezra is a long, fancy toothpick used to hold sandwiches together. He has a purple frill on his head and only one eye.  Glossary  = Lithen = Lithens are the original inhabitants of Foo. They were placed there by the guiding force of Foo, fate. Their mission is to preserve the real Foo, and its place as a modifier of dreams. They are extremely honest and are believed to be incorruptible. The most prominent lithen is Geth. They live by fate, and are afraid of almost nothing. = Niteon = Nits are also called niteons. They are humans who had been on Earth and brought to Foo. They are the working class of Foo. They are stable, and one of the best dream enhancers. After they arrive in Foo, they are given a powerful gift. For example, many nits can control ice or levitate. Winter Frore and Sabine are examples of nits, and they both can control ice. The entire list of Nit powers are as follows: *See through soil *super speed *Freeze things *Breathe fire *Levitate objects *Burrow *See through stone *Shrink *Throw lightning *Push and bind dreams *Fly *Fade in and out = Offing = Offings are rare and extremely powerful. They can see and manipulate the future, such as Leven Thumps had. They can also learn other gifts. As a result, they are the most trusted confidante of the Want. They grow through experience, not time. = Rant = Rants are offspring from nits, that were born with too little character to manipulate dreams successfully. They are frequently in a disarray. As dreams catch them, half of their bodies become the imagination of what the one in reality is dreaming of. They are usually dressed in long robes to hide their unstable forms. Jamoon is an example of a rant. = Sycophant = Sycophants are assigned to those who step into Foo. They help those that come in to adjust and understand the ways. Their entire lives are spent serving their people, called their burns. There is only one way for sycophants to die, but only the sycophants know, until the secret finds Leven and tells him how. Clover is a sycophant. Sycophants love to serve, but sometimes get sick of helping others. So they are equipped with a venom that knocks out their victims immediately, and the victims are put in a trance where they are shown scenes depicting how wonderful sycophants are. = The Want = The Want is the invisible, but felt sage of Foo. He lives on the island of Lith, and sees every dream that comes in. He is prophetic, but a bit insane from his visions. = Cog = Cogs are ungifted children of nits. They have no single talent, but they can manipulate and enhance dreams. = Whisp = When those from Earth step on a partial way to get to Foo, they don't get there completely. They only partially arrive, since their bodies and souls stay on Earth feeling like they are missing something. They are called whisps, and are similar to ghosts. They are members of governing councils and boards. They are very vulnerable to flattery, and wish most for soul stones, to become whole.

The synthesizers, sequencers, and drum-machines used were designed and constructed by Raymond Scott. Background Scott would often describe Manhattan Research, Inc. as \\"More than a think factory - a dream center where the excitement of tomorrow is made available today.\\" The material, while never intended for commercial release, provides insight into Scott's work. Included among the tracks on the album are commercials for companies such as Ford Motor and IBM, a humorous \\"Audio Logo\\" collage entitled \\"Don't Beat Your Wife Every Night!\\", and various collaborations with Jim Henson (of Muppets fame). The album features a number of Scott's inventions including the Clavivox keyboard, Circle Machine, Bass Line Generator, Rhythm Modulator, Karloff, Bandito the Bongo Artist, and the auto-composing Electronium. Much of the audio selections, as well as the images for the accompanying 144-page book, were culled from the University of Missouri Kansas City's extensive collection of Raymond Scott material. Album producers Gert- Jan Blom and Jeff Winner worked with several of the university's staff in choosing material for the project. During the process, the two producers were impressed by the quality and fidelity of the recordings, despite being some thirty to forty years old. Due to Scott's meticulous attention to detail, \\"They were so well recorded that almost no audio correction was necessary during the mastering\\" of the album.\\" In the CD notes, Blom & Winner write, \\"Scott sought to master all aspects of sound capture and manipulation.

Characters  = Winter Frore = Winter is thirteen, with white-blond hair and deep evergreen eyes. Her pale skin and willowy clothes give her the appearance of a neglected girl. Like Sabine, she is a nit and has the ability to freeze and thaw out whatever she wishes. She was swept away to Foo, but her thoughts and memories of her previous life are gone. Winter struggles just to figure out what her purpose is. In book two, her gift is forcefully taken away from her by a machine that she \\"created\\" in her past life. She also has a burning love for Leven. = Geth = The heir to the throne of the land of Foo, and one of the Lithens, the people who were chosen by fate to be on Foo first. He was turned into a Fantrum seed by Sabine, and grew until Terry Graph (Leven's Uncle) chopped him down for destroying his house. Geth then became a toothpick who helped Leven on his quest to stop the war of merging Reality and Foo. In Leven Thumps and the Whispered Secret Geth was returned to his old self in the turrets, and The City of Geth was restored. Because he is a Lithen, he is never afraid and always trusts in fate. He is also incredibly optimistic, though that is probably more because when he was a tree and dropped into a processor at the Tactum Company toothpick section, a part of him was shaved off and placed in a different toothpick. The part chopped off was all his anger and confusion, leaving a happy, carefree Lithen as Geth. Geth has long, dark blonde hair and bright blue eyes. He's very old, but still looks very young. His height is originally tall, but it fluctuates during the books due to part of him being missing. In this book he shrinks. He is told to always wear a look of wonder and amazement on his face. = Clover Ernest = He is a wise-cracking sycophant from Foo, sent by the nit Antsel to look after Leven, who becomes his burn. Anstel is also Clovers previous burn. He constantly tries to find a nickname for Leven (many of which include Chief and Big Man), as Winter calls Leven Lev. Clover is extremely loyal but often tricks Leven into trying various candies which causes Leven to turn into or become or forget certain things.(i.e. Leven turns to goo, or Leven forgets what he is doing.) Clover has the power to turn invisible with his cloak, and as a sycophant there is only one way that he can die, but only the sycophants and Leven know what that is. Clovers bite puts people to sleep and makes them love sycophants for a few hours when they wake up. =Ezra= Ezra is Geth's other half. When Geth was turned into a toothpick, the bad was cut out of him and made into a toothpick that then became Ezra. Ezra is rude and is a devil toothpick that only knows hate. in the second book, Ezra is picked up by a man named Dennis who is or was a janitor for a high dollar business. =Dennis= Dennis is an emotionally troubled man that stumbles upon a mass of tiny evil, this evil happens to be Ezra, the toothpick. He was not loved as a child and is not appreciated for his hard work at his job. During a flight to Germany, the evil Sabine is captured by Ezra as hazen maul the plane bringing it to a halt above an interstate. Slowly Sabine starts to take over Dennis leaving him an even emptier shell of a man than he was before. Dennis lacks the ability to dream.

This branch of the nervous system is not under conscious control and is largely responsible for the regulation of several body compartments at rest. Vagal activity results in various effects, including: heart rate reduction, vasodilation/constriction of vessels, glandular activity in the heart, lungs, and digestive tract, liver, immune system regulation as well as control of gastrointestinal sensitivity, motility and inflammation. In this context, tone specifically refers to the continual nature of baseline parasympathetic action that the vagus nerve exerts. While baseline vagal input is constant, the degree of stimulation it exerts is regulated by a balance of inputs from sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system, with parasympathetic activity generally being dominant. Vagal tone is frequently used to assess heart function, and is also useful in assessing emotional regulation and other processes that alter, or are altered by, changes in parasympathetic activity. Measurements of vagal tone can be performed by means of either invasive or noninvasive procedures. Invasive procedures are in the minority and include vagus nerve stimulation by specific manual, breathing or electrical techniques. Noninvasive techniques mainly rely on the investigation of heart rate and heart rate variability.  Noninvasive vagal tone quantification  In most cases, vagal tone is not measured directly. Instead the processes affected by the vagus nerve ‚Äì specifically heart rate and heart rate variability ‚Äì are measured and used as a surrogate for vagal tone. Increased vagal tone (and thus vagal action) is generally associated with a lower heart rate and increased heart rate variability. However, during graded orthostatic tilt, vagal tone withdrawal is an indirect indicator of cardiovascular fitness. = Vagal innervation of the heart = Heart rate is largely controlled by the heart's internal pacemaker activity. In a healthy heart, the main pacemaker is a collection of cells on the border of the atria and vena cava called the sinoatrial node. Heart cells exhibit automaticity, the ability to generate electrical activity independent of external stimulation. The electrical activity spontaneously generated by the sinoatrial node sets the pace for the rest of the heart. In absence of external stimuli, sinoatrial pacing generally maintains the heart rate in the range of 60‚Äì100 beats per minute (bpm). The two branches of the autonomic nervous system work together to increase or slow the heart rate. The vagus nerve acts on the sinoatrial node, slowing its conduction and modulating vagal tone, via the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and downstream changes to ionic currents and calcium of heart cells. Because of its effect on heart rate, and cardio health, vagal tone can be measured and understood by examining its correlation to heart rate modulation and heart rate variability. =Respiratory sinus arrhythmia= Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is typically a benign, normal variation in heart rate that occurs during each breathing cycle: the heart rate increases when breathing in and decreases when breathing out. RSA was first recognized by Carl Ludwig in 1847 but is still imperfectly understood. It has been observed in humans from the early stages of life through adulthood, and is found in several different species. During inhalation, the intra-thoracic pressure lowers due to the contraction and downward movement of the diaphragm and the expansion of the chest cavity. Atrial pressure is also lowered as a result, causing increased blood flow to the heart, which in turn decreases baroreceptors firing response which diminishes vagal tone. This causes an increase in heart rate. During exhalation, the diaphragm relaxes, moving upward, and decreases the size of the chest cavity, causing an increase in intrathoracic pressure. This increase in pressure inhibits venous return to the heart resulting in both reduced atrial expansion and increased activation of baroreceptors. This relieves the suppression of vagal tone and leads to a decreased heart rate. 274x274px Heart rate (HR) (first row), ECG signal (ECG) (second row), and respiration (third row) for a newborn subject in a 15-seconds recording. HR expresses oscillations synchronous with respect to respiration. 274x274px  RSA as a vagal tone estimator  Respiratory sinus arrhythmia is frequently used as a noninvasive method for investigating vagal tone, in physiological, behavioral, and several clinical studies. This can be done using electrocardiography (ECG) recording, although other methods are also being developed that take advantage of the interactions between ECG and respiration. Interpretation of RSA measurements must be done with care, however, as several factors including differences between individuals can change the relationship between RSA and vagal tone. Evolution and physiology It has been suggested that RSA may have evolved to save energy for both cardiac and respiratory systems by reducing the heart rate and by suppressing ineffective ventilation during the ebb of perfusion (delivery of blood from arteries to capillaries for oxygenation and nutrition). RSA has been found to increase in subjects in resting state and to decrease in states of stress or tension. It is increased in supine position and decreased in prone position, and is on average higher and more pronounced during the day as compared to the night. RSA has also been extensively used to quantify vagal tone withdrawal in graded orthostatic tilt. Typically, expression of RSA decreases with age. However, adults in excellent cardiovascular health, such as endurance runners, swimmers, and cyclists, are likely to have a more pronounced RSA. Professional athletes on average maintain very high vagal tone and consequently higher RSA levels. RSA is less prominent in individuals with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Insights into psychology and disease Vagal tone research has the potential to offer insight into social behavior, social interactions, and human psychology. Much of this work has been focused on newborns and children. Baseline vagal tone can be used either as a potential predictor of behavior or as a signal of mental health (particularly emotion regulation, anxiety, and internalizing and externalizing disorders). The polyvagal theory by Porges is an influential model of how the vagal pathways respond to novelty and to stressful external stimuli. The theory proposes that there are two vagal systems, one that is shared with reptiles and amphibia and a second, more recent, system that is unique to mammals. The two pathways behave differently and can work against each other. This theory can account for several psychophysiological phenomena and psychosomatic illnesses. However, recent studies indicate that the vagal \\"system\\" described by Porges as being unique to mammals existed long before the evolution of mammals. RSA and vagal tone are used as markers to help determine the severity of neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorders. Children with more secure attachments with their mothers exhibited greater empathetic responsiveness, less social inhibition, and higher vagal tone. = Other estimates of vagal tone = There are several methods of estimating vagal tone other than measuring RSA, including: * Indexes of beat-to-beat variability such as RMSSD reported by The Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and Heart Rhythm Society. Frequency analysis of heart rate in the range 0.15‚Äì0.4 Hz has been reported to quantify vagal tone. * Computation of the \\"power spectrum\\", or the ratio between the low frequency and high frequency spectral components, of heart rate variability. This has been used to measure the change in sympatho-vagal balance during hypnosis.

History  Until 1970 South Shore Line interurbans served downtown South Bend at LaSalle and Michigan. The city had long wanted to eliminate street running, while the South Shore was looking to reduce costs as passenger traffic declined. The South Shore embarked on a program to consolidate its operations in South Bend. This included constructing the current station building at Meade and Washington and selling the old downtown station, which had opened in 1921. When Amtrak took over intercity rail service in 1971, it used this station instead of the larger Union Station. The South Shore Line moved its terminus to a new terminal at the South Bend International Airport in November 1992, although the track that used to terminate here was retained.

Colombian Presidents; Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n; Page 127; Bogot√°, Colombia; 1983  Early life  Pay√°n was born in Santiago de Cali on August 1, 1825. Pay√°n studied in the Colegio Santa Libarda, in Cali, and later graduated as a lawyer, profession he practiced mostly in the city of Buga along with commerce and other administrative jobs. He also founded the Democratic Society of Buga and produced a newspaper, El Sentimiento Democr√°tico, with the help of Manuel Antonio Scarpetta and Ram√≥n Mercado.  Military career  Pay√°n joined the army, and most of the time was under the orders of liberal commanders. In 1840, Pay√°n participated in the War of the Supremes under the command of General Jos√© Mar√≠a Obando, fighting against the army of President Jos√© Ignacio de M√°rquez. Later, in 1854, he joined the army of Jos√© Hilario L√≥pez in the battles against Jos√© Mar√≠a Melo. Pay√°n became a general in the army and participated in the Colombian Civil War of 1860‚Äì1862 supporting General Tom√°s Cipriano de Mosquera against the legitimate and constitutional government of conservative President Mariano Ospina Rodr√≠guez. General Pay√°n intervened in the Colombian Civil War of 1876 to defend the government of Aquileo Parra. At the battle of Los Chancos, he was taken prisoner by the conservative forces. General Juli√°n Trujillo, commander of the Caucan Army, appointed him brigadier of a revolutionary division. He was able to confront and defeat the conservative forces in Antioquia at the Battle of Batero. In 1879, he organized an army to topple the president of the State of Cauca. Governor Garc√©s was deposed, and Payan gave control to a civilian, Ezequiel Hurtado, who was then elected as President of the State of Cauca. In 1885, Pay√°n joins the forces of conservative President Rafael N√∫√±ez in the civil war against the liberal rebels. After the war, N√∫√±ez appoints him as Minister of War. Political career After the war, Pay√°n began his political career in the Provincial Chamber of Cauca, where he became known for his oratory skills. Between 1854 and 1855, Pay√°n served in the Congress of Colombia as the representative for Cauca.  President of Colombia After being re-elected President of Cauca, Pay√°n, who had also being elected Vice President of Colombia, had to resign his post in Cauca to replace the ailing sitting President N√∫√±ez. He assumed office on January 6, 1887 and served as president until June 4. He once again was called to replace President N√∫√±ez on December 13, 1882 to February 8, 1888 while the President recovered. During his control of the presidency Pay√°n decreed the absolute freedom of press in the nation, a policy that created great controversy, which forced him to resign as Vice President after the constant struggles with his opponents in Congress and the President himself. Death He died in Buga on June 30, 1895.

The title is a pun on \\"rock and roll\\", despite the music played being jazz. Animation was by Ben Washam, Dick Thompson, Tom Ray, Don Towsley and Ken Harris (mainly Dick and Don). Plot In Tom and Jerry's penthouse apartment room on the 20th floor of a 30-story apartment building around 10:00 PM, Tom finishes reading a book and prepares to sleep, setting his wind-up alarm clock to ring in the morning. Unfortunately for Tom, this is also time for Jerry to get up. The mouse's alarm-watch rings and Jerry showers (using a wrench on a pipe) and grooms himself before setting out for a tiny elevator in the wall. He hears Tom snoring and stops briefly (with a close-up of Tom's feet) before he enters the elevator and descends to a club with a sign that says \\"Le Cellar Smoqu√©\\" (\\"The Smoky Cellar\\" in French) displayed at its entrance. Jerry arrives at the bar and has a martini (of which he only eats the cheese on the toothpick, leaving the bartender to drink the rest of the martini). Then, Jerry begins playing the drums with a jazz octet, which puts the club into full swing. Shortly afterward, being woken up by the noise, Tom opens the elevator, only to get blasted by the music. He tries to block the elevator doors with a pillow, but it's not enough to stop the noise. He lowers a hose into the elevator shaft in hopes of drowning out the noise. His smug laughter is interrupted by an angry dog that drags Tom downstairs and throws him into his flooded apartment room. Dripping wet, Tom goes back to his apartment room and decides to stop the noise at its source by grabbing some tools and heading down to the basement through the air vents. Hearing the music through the floor, Tom saws a hole in the floor and uses a plunger, but the music is coming from a radio, and to make matters worse, the angry dog (whom the radio belonged to) pulls Tom up through the floor and punches him back up to his 10th floor apartment room through the floors and his bed. Now completely bruised and sleep deprived, Tom cries over this and puts bigger corks in his ears, wraps up his head with first-aid bandages and tries to settle down to sleep. At that very moment the music stops, causing an elated Tom to wake up with a start, lose the bandages and pop the corks out. A tired Jerry is seen leaving the elevator toward his mousehole. Tom gleefully goes back to sleep, only to be awoken seconds later by his ringing alarm clock he had set before. However, having been woken up by the noise, Jerry turns on the light in his Mouse hole, peeks out, and signals to Tom to turn off the alarm clock with a shush, but this hypocritical action from Jerry immediately causes Tom to scream (since Jerry kept him up all the night) and run straight out through the wall, leaving a Tom-shaped hole on the wall. A confused Jerry shrugs it off, thinking that Tom's gone bonkers and imitates a Charlie Chaplin silent walk before going back to sleep.

North Karnataka is predominantly famous for Hindustani music and South Karnataka is well known for Carnatic music. =Carnatic= With the rise of Vaishnavism and the Haridasa movement came Karnataka composers like Purandaradasa, whose Kannada language works were lucid, devotional and philosophical and hence appealing to the masses. Other haridasas of medieval times were Kanakadasa, Vyasatirtha, Jayatirtha, Sripadaraya, Vadirajatirtha etc., who composed several devara nama. One of the earliest and prominent composers in South India was the saint, and wandering bard of yore Purandara Dasa. Though historians claim Purandara Dasa composed 75,000 - 475,000 songs in Sanskrit and Kannada, only a few hundred of them are known today. He was a source of inspiration to the later composers like Tyagaraja. Owing to his contribution to the Carnatic Music he is referred to as the Father of Carnatic Music (Karnataka Sangeeta Pitamaha).Owing to his contributions to carnatic music, Purandaradasa is known as Karnataka Sangita Pitamaha Purandaradasa codified and consolidated the teaching of Carnatic music by evolving several steps like sarali, jantai(Janti), thattu varisai (Thattu Varise), alankara and geetham (geethe) and laid down a framework for imparting formal training in this art form.Iyer (2006), p93 Later in the 17th and 18th centuries, the haridasa movement would once again contribute to music in Karnataka in the form of haridasas such as Vijaya Dasa, Gopaladasa, Jagannathadasa who are just a few among a vast galaxy of devotional saints. =Hindustani= Karnataka has achieved a prominent place in the world of Hindustani music as well. Several of Karnataka's Hindustani musicians won the Kalidas Sanman, Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan awards. Some famous performers are Gangubai Hangal, Puttaraj Gawai, Pt. Bhimsen Joshi, Pt. Mallikarjun Mansur, Basavaraj Rajguru, Sawai Gandharva and Kumar Gandharva.  Dance  =Yakshagana= Yakshagana a form of dance drama is one of the major theatrical forms in coastal Karnataka. A fusion of folk and classical tradition makes Yakshagana a unique form of art which includes colourful costumes, music, dance, singing, and most importantly dialogs composed on the fly. Award-winning performers include Shambhu Hegde, Chittani Ramachandra Hegde. Yakshagana and Dollu Kunitha are two of the popular dance forms of Karnataka. Gamaka is a unique music form based on Karnakata Sangeetha. Pilivesha Pilivesha a dance form popularly displayed on the streets and temples around the coastal Karnataka.

He was also involved in Galaxy, CAPA-Alpha, Apa-5, and other amateur press alliances.1997 \\"Southern Fandom Confederation Handbook & History PART II: DSCs, Rebels, Rubbles, & Phoenixes\\"1997 \\"Southern Fandom Confederation Handbook & History PART III: Regional Survey\\" Career Biggers' first professional writing was done for Jim Steranko's Mediascene magazine in 1972; he worked intermittently for Steranko for two years. At the same time, he and his wife Susan H. Biggers co-edited and published the science fiction review magazine Future Retrospective. He and Susan Biggers received the 1977 Rebel Award for outstanding Southern science fiction fan achievement for their work with Future Retrospective. Biggers was a founding member of the Atlanta Science Fiction Club (ASFiC) in 1977. He wrote and edited Atarantes, the ASFiC publication, until 1982, when he cut back his involvement in Atlanta science fiction. In 1982, Biggers became a co-owner of a comic shop, Dr. No's, for which he began writing a newsletter, The Doctor Knows. That newsletter grew into Comic Shop News, a publication he co-launched with Ward Batty in the spring of 1987. CSN grew to become the largest- circulation weekly in the comic book industry, and still continues as a weekly publication. Biggers also wrote dozens of articles for Krause Publications' Comics Buyer's Guide in the 1980s and 1990s, and acted as their primary price guide adviser for many of those years. Biggers also created and wrote the comic book After Apocalypse, which featured the first published artwork of Mark Bagley (who would later go on to illustrate The Amazing Spider-Man and Ultimate Spider-Man) and Dave Johnson. In the 1990s, he co-wrote Earth Boys with Brett Brooks; the series was illustrated by co-creator Dave Johnson. The recurring comic book story was featured in several issues of Dark Horse Comics' Dark Horse Presents. He and Brett Brooks also co-wrote the final three issues of I-Bots, the Tekno Comics series based on a concept by Isaac Asimov. In those issues, they introduced the Corp-Bots, a group of characters who were scheduled to appear in their own adventures until Tekno abruptly ceased publishing.

According to her colleague Rutland Barrington, Hood was \\"a perfect picture to look at and equally pleasant to listen to ... tall, slight, and graceful, a typical English girl with a wealth of fair hair, which I believe was all her own. Her singing of the waltz song, 'Poor Wandering One', was quite one of the features of the first act [of Pirates].\\"Seeley, Paul. \\"Marion Hood\\", Memories of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, accessed 30 July 2020 The New York Times wrote that she had \\"a soprano voice of rare flexibility and power.\\" After that engagement, Hood left the company and married her second husband, Mr. Hesseltine, taking a brief break from performing until August 1881, when she appeared as Constance in the first production of Stephens and Solomon's Claude Duval at the Olympic Theatre, with George Power who had been her partner as Frederic in Pirates. She then sang at the Alhambra Theatre and Avenue Theatre, performing in Frederic Clay's Golden Ring and Karl Mill√∂cker's The Beggar Student. After this, she toured the British provinces in grand opera, appearing as Marguerite in Faust, in which role she then appeared at the Crystal Palace.

As an advocate for interdisciplinarity, he initiated a movement of materials research societies and, outside of his multiple areas of scientific and engineering expertise, wrote impassioned pleas about the need for a fusion of religion and science and humanistic causes. Later in life he held visiting professorships in materials science at Arizona State University, and in medicine at the University of Arizona. Early life and education Roy was born in Ranchi, Bihar Province, India, the son of Narenda Kumar and Rajkumari Roy. Rustum took a Cambridge School Certificate from Saint Paul's School Darjeeling. Rustum studied physical chemistry at Patna University, gaining his bachelor's degree in 1942 and master's degree in 1944. The following year he began study at Pennsylvania State University and earned his Ph.D. in engineering ceramics in 1948. Rustum Roy married Della Martin on June 8 that year.

In 1974 Roy and Olaf M√ºller published The Major Ternary Structural Families with Springer-Verlag, which described the principal crystal structures of ternary compounds. The book received two brief reviews in materials trade journals. A cement journal reviewer said it would be \\"Useful to the practicing materials researcher, whether in industry or university, as well as the non-specialist who needs to become informed about particular materials.\\" A chemist writing for mineral processing readers, described its depth: :The structural descriptions are at times too brief but the chapters contain valuable information such as compositional structure field maps (radius A vs. radius B), figures of unit cells or the polyhedral arrangements in some common structures, phase diagrams (P vs. T , or P vs. ionic radius), structural relationships, and phase transition data. By 1991 he was a spokesperson for the movement and his lecture \\"New Materials: Fountainhead for New Technologies and New Science\\" was published by National Academy Press.New Materials: Fountainhead for New Technologies and New Science, link from Google Books Roy presented the lecture to learned audiences in Washington, D.C.; Tokyo, Japan; New Delhi, Stockholm, Copenhagen, and London in 1991 and 92.

The scandal In 1988, prior to becoming prime minister, Chr√©tien and two business partners had purchased the $625,000 Grand-M√®re Golf Course and Auberge Grand-M√®re Hotel. In 1993, six months before he became prime minister, Chr√©tien and his partners agreed to sell the hotel to Yvon Duhaime, a personal friend of Chr√©tien. A month after becoming prime minister, Chr√©tien agreed to sell his personal shares in the golf course to Toronto tycoon Jonas Prince. However, by January 1996, Chr√©tien was still the formal owner of the golf course since Prince had never paid for the shares. He reported this fact to the Federal Ethics Counsellor, Howard Wilson. Meanwhile, new hotel owner Yvon Duhaime applied to the Business Development Bank of Canada for a $2,000,000 loan to expand the hotel. Chr√©tien took a personal interest in the transaction, and both phoned and met with the bank's director, but to no avail ‚Äì Duhaime's application was declined. In early 1997, Chr√©tien began asking the bank if it would be possible to extend a smaller loan to expand the hotel. The bank agreed to loan Duhaime $615,000 and the Federal Human Resources Department awarded Duhaime an additional $164,000 grant. The scandal comes to light The scandal came to light slowly, with information only being released by the governing Liberal Party after a series of newspaper reports and after persistent questioning by members of the Opposition in the House of Commons of Canada, and a formal lawsuit. In 1999, Ethics Commissioner Wilson ruled that Chr√©tien had not violated any ethical boundaries when the hotel was awarded federal grant money although he later admitted that he was unaware Chr√©tien had taken such a personal interest by meeting with the bank president in an effort to secure the $615,000 loan. While Chr√©tien faced harsh criticism from all opposition parties, Stockwell Day, then-leader of the Canadian Alliance, denounced him calling him a \\"criminal\\", while Joe Clark continued an investigation accusing Chr√©tien of abusing power, and demanded that he resign as prime minister until a public inquiry could be held. Litigation In September 2003, the former president of the bank that had initially declined the loan won his wrongful dismissal claim, and it was ruled that he was fired because he had suggested that it was time to collect on the $615,000 loan in 1999. In early March 2008, Ontario's top court ordered the National Post, a major Canadian newspaper, to hand over documents in the \\"Shawinigate\\" allegations, saying the need to enforce the law should outweigh the need to protect anonymous sources. In May 2010, the National Post lost its appeal, with the Supreme Court of Canada reinstating the search warrant despite the newspaper's claims of journalist-source privilege under Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

He also earned six caps, scoring one goal, with the United States men's national soccer team. Youth Peterson was born and raised in Tacoma, Washington where he attended Wilson High School. He played soccer at Wilson, as well as for the Norpoint Royals Soccer Club. Professional Peterson elected to forgo college and joined the Seattle Sounders development program in 1979. This was the Sounders' sixth season in the North American Soccer League (NASL). In 1980, he was called up to the first team where he had an immediate impact. In 34 games that year, he scored 18 goals. Despite his prolific scoring pace, he came in second for 1980 Rookie of the Year to Jeff Durgan of the New York Cosmos, a youth team mate of Peterson‚Äôs at the Norpoint Royals. In 1981, Peterson experienced a sophomore slump, scoring only five goals in 21 games, but came back strong in 1982 to bag 19 goals in 38 games and take the 1982 North American Player of the Year honors. In 1983, he continued his excellent work with the Sounders, but experienced a difficult playing situation. The U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF) had placed the national team, known as Team America into the NASL as one of the league‚Äôs franchises. They did this in order to create a more unified and successful team. However, several top U.S. players, Peterson included, chose not to join Team America. This sparked considerable consternation and bitterness within the national team as players with Team America criticized those who remained with their NASL teams. The pressure on USSF and Team America mounted as the national team performed poorly. Finally, USSF negotiated an agreement with the other NASL teams to allow them to loan U.S. players to Team America when they were not needed. This resulted in Peterson playing 21 games in 1983 for the Sounders and 7 games for Team America. Unfortunately for Peterson, both the Sounders and Team America folded at the end of the 1983 season. On October 2, 1983, he was selected by the New York Cosmos in the Sounders‚Äô dispersal draft. He never played for the Cosmos as the NASL began to collapse. On November 24, 1983 he signed a two year contract with Tacoma Stars of Major Indoor Soccer League. He led the team in scoring during the 1983‚Äì1984 season. In March 1987, he signed with F.C.

It was established by the Episcopal Church of the United States (Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America) in 1901 by American missionaries led by Charles Henry Brent, who served as the first resident bishop, when the Philippines was opened to Protestant American missionaries. It became an autonomous province of the Anglican Communion on May 1, 1990. At present, the Episcopal Church has seven dioceses. Under Rev. Charles Henry Brent of the Episcopal Church of the United States of America, it was responsible for founding and overseeing institutions such as St. Luke's Medical Center, Brent International School, St. Stephen's High School, and Trinity University of Asia. Its principal ministerial training institution is St. Andrew's Theological Seminary. The current Prime Bishop is Joel Pachao. Its national headquarters is the Cathedral Heights, New Manila, Quezon City. The Church is in a concordat of full communion with the Philippine Independent Church and is a member of both the Christian Conference of Asia and the National Council of Churches in the Philippines. History =Military chaplaincy and church for expatriates= The emblem of the Anglican/Episcopal Church in the Philippines when it was still a missionary province under the Episcopal Church of the United States When the Philippines was ceded to the United States from Spain in 1898, the Philippine islands was opened to Protestant American missions. A comity agreement was created between Protestant sects to divide the islands. The Protestant Episcopalians and Seventh-day Adventists did not joined the agreement because they wanted to go elsewhere in the Philippines. The Episcopal Church in the Philippines virtually began with the first Episcopal worship service conducted in the Philippines by the Rev. Charles Pierce, an Episcopal Church chaplain of the U.S. Armed Forces that occupied Manila in 1898. This service was conducted on September 4, 1898 for the Americans and other English-speaking residents in Manila. The first Episcopal Church worship service conducted for Filipinos took place on December 25, 1898. The Cathedral of St. Mary and St. John in Manila (1923), before it was destroyed in World War 2 In April 1899, Hugh Nethercott and James Smiley of the Brotherhood of St. Andrew arrived to assist the American chaplains in their work. In September 1899, Frederick R. Graves, who was then serving as the Bishop of Shanghai in China, visited Manila. Appointed to oversee American church work in the Philippines and later, bishop-in-charge, he held worship services in the home of a British couple. He confirmed five English-speaking persons and advised his congregation to build a church. He also received the first seven Filipinos into the Episcopal Church. The first baptisms in Manila were performed in 1900 by U.S. Army Chaplain John Marvine when he baptized three Amoy-speaking nationals and 12 more by the end of the year. These baptisms formally started Episcopal mission work among the Chinese in Manila. =As a missionary district of PECUSA= Rev. Gouverneur Frank Mosher, the Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the Philippines from 1920 to 1941 From being a mere outreach chaplaincy of the Episcopal Church chaplains of the U.S. occupation armed forces in the Philippines. Temporarily placed under the oversight of Bishop Frederick Graves, it was officially created as the Missionary District of the Philippine Islands of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States (PECUSA) by the PECUSA General Convention held in San Francisco on October 4‚Äì11, 1901. The same convention elected the Rev. Charles Henry Brent as bishop. In December 1901, Brent was consecrated and became the first bishop of the Missionary District under the jurisdiction of PECUSA. His successor, Gouverneur Frank Mosher, served from 1920 to 1941. From October 11, 1901, when the church was officially established in the Philippines, it took the church almost 36 years to produce its first Filipino clergymen with the ordination of Eduardo Longid, Albert Masferre, and Mark Suluen to the Sacred Order of Deacons on January 25, 1937. It took another 22 years to produce the first Filipino Episcopal bishop with the consecration of Benito C. Cabanban as Suffragan Bishop on February 24, 1959. =Philippine Episcopal Church= National Cathedral of the Episcopal Church in the Philippines, dedicated to Saint Mary and Saint John In October 1937, the Missionary District of the Philippine Islands was renamed the Philippine Episcopal Church (PEC) through the action of the House of Bishops of PECUSA's Cincinnati General Convention. This signified a change in status of the Philippine Church from that of a missionary district to a ‚Äòdiocese‚Äô under PECUSA. Thirty-four years later (in October 1971), PECUSA granted the PEC request to divide the lone diocese into three dioceses ‚Äì the Dioceses of Central, Northern, and Southern Philippines. Each had a Filipino diocesan bishop ‚Äì Bishop Cabanban, Bishop Eduardo Longid, and Bishop Constancio Manguramas, respectively. With three dioceses, the PEC was organized and operated like a church province in the Anglican Communion. However, unlike the other church provinces, the PEC did not have a Metropolitan Authority because it was still under the jurisdiction of PECUSA. The three dioceses were considered dioceses of both the PEC and the Episcopal Church in the U.S.A. (ECUSA). As a diocese, the PEC had its own constitution and canons, national council, national biennial convention, House of Bishops, and National Office, among others. =Full autonomy= On May 1, 1990, the PEC was officially separated from ECUSA and inaugurated as an autonomous church taking its place as a church province in the Anglican Communion with the name Episcopal Church in the Philippines (ECP). The Cathedral of the Resurrection in Baguio. When the church had been admitted as a missionary district, its first missionary bishop, Charles Henry Brent, unlike other Protestant missionaries, had no intention of converting Filipino Roman Catholics to Anglicanism. As a consequence, his missionary focus was in those parts of the islands that had not previously been evangelised, in particular, in the mountain provinces and in Mindanao. In Manila missionary work was also done among the non-Christian Chinese community. In Manila Bishop Brent felt his ministry to the American community should be his main focus. He wrote: ‚ÄúFrom every point of view, the most important part of our work is among Americans and other English-speaking people.‚Äù One of the first things he did was to build a cathedral in downtown Manila, the Cathedral of St. Mary & St. John, which was destroyed during World War II and later rebuilt in Quezon City. It was at that time that part of the Cathedral congregation formed the Church of the Holy Trinity, now located in the upscale village of Forbes Park, Makati City. Holy Trinity's priest or rector from its beginning had always been an expatriate and its congregation was for the most part of expatriates; in recent years this has changed considerably and at the present it is an even mixture of Chinese Filipino, American/European and Filipino. St. Luke's Hospital in Manila (1923) For the physical health needs of his constituency, Brent also established St. Luke's Hospital (initially named University Hospital, now known as St. Luke's Medical Center). He also endorsed and supported the establishment of St. Luke's Nursing Training School (now St. Luke's-Trinity College of Nursing) to answer the need for well-trained nurses to serve the hospital. Baguio School for boys in 1923 For the educational needs and in response to requests from the American parents for a boarding school for their children, Bishop Brent founded a school in Baguio City for American boys. First called the Baguio School and later Brent School, this school is now known as Brent International School-Baguio. It is one of four Brent International Schools under the umbrella of a mother corporation called Brent International Schools Inc. The others are Brent International School- Manila/Bi√±an, BIS-Subic, and BIS-Boracay. In addition to children of expatriates, a large number, if not the majority, of enrollees in the Brent Schools are Filipinos from well-to-do families. With regard to starting missionary work and establishing a church for and among the unchurched, Bishop Brent was against proselytization. Having observed the extensive work of the Roman Catholic Church in the islands, he decided not to ‚Äúput up an altar over and against another altar‚Äù. He adopted a policy of ‚Äúnon-interference under ordinary circumstances with the adherents of other churches‚Äù. Along this line, he decided to concentrate the mission work of the newly established church on the Americans and white Europeans in the country as well as on those geographic areas where there were non-Christians or where the unchurched were not being served by any church. Church of the Holy Trinity in Zamboanga City, 1923 At that time, most non-Christians in the Philippines were migrant Chinese in Manila, indigenous peoples in the North and in the South as well the Muslims in Mindanao. The \\"pagan natives\\" of the north and of the south and the Muslims, living in communities in mountain jungles, had fought against the subjugation and rule of the colonial Spanish regime and had not effectively fallen under the rule and governance of Spain. It was to these people and communities that this church went to seek its members through conversions and baptisms. The church succeeded in its mission and evangelism work among the indigenous people but failed among the Muslims. It converted only five young Muslims girls by uprooting these girls from their communities in Mindanao and bringing them to the Cordillera in the north, where they lived and grew with the missionaries in Christian communities. They were educated, got married, and settled in the Cordillera and did not go back to their Muslim roots in the South. St. Stephen's Church in Manila for Chinese Filipinos in 1923 Bishop Brent's policy of not putting an altar against another altar and the initial and subsequent concentration of missionary work on areas inhabited by non- Christians explains why most of the members of the ECP are predominantly from tribal communities. This also explains why the ECP's work is concentrated in the northern and southern regions of the country. In like manner, it explains why it took almost four decades for this Church to produce its first Filipino clergymen and more than half-a-century to produce its first Filipino bishop, all of whom were from tribal communities. It was this Church that introduced literacy among these people and communities. It was this Church that first established schools, hospitals, clinics and roads in these oft-neglected communities. In time, the government was able to establish public schools, hospitals, and rural health centers for these communities. As a result, this Church phased out some of its schools and clinics in favor of the government providing such basic services needed by these communities. Doctrine and practice The Episcopal Church in the Philippines maintains the historic threefold ministry of bishops, priests, and deacons. A local variant of the Book of Common Prayer is used. Structure =Prime Bishop= The Episcopal Church in the Philippines is headed by the Prime Bishop of the Philippines, serving as both primate and metropolitan archbishop of the entire church. The post was created in 1969 as a metropolitan role under the primacy of the Presiding Bishop of the American Episcopal Church, and took on the additional role of Primate when the province gained autonomy in 1990. Contrary to common Anglican practice, but like the Presiding Bishop of the American Episcopal Church and the Supreme Bishop of the Philippine Independent Church, the Prime Bishop is not a diocesan bishop.

Rayo's work shows that geometric art is as much a part of the past as it is of the future. He used traces of the past to discover new ways to present visual and geometric sketches. One of his most celebrated exhibitions was carried out in the National Room of the Museum of the Palace of fine arts of Mexico, titled \\"20 years, 100 works: Omar Rayo.\\" Museum The Museo Rayo de Dibujo y Grabado Latinoamericano was founded on January 20, 1981 by Rayo in his hometown of Roldanillo with funds the artist himself provided. The museum was also funded with help from the Colombian government and others so that this site would remain a permanent exhibit of his works of art during the late 1980s. The museum was designed by Mexican architect Leopoldo Gout and opened with a collection of 2,000 of Rayo's artwork and some 500 other Latin American artists' works. The museum contains a library, many modules for expositions, a graphic arts workshop and a theater.

Rayo suffered his first heart attack in 1998, and a more serious one in January 2006, which resulted in him spending 30 hours in a coma before recovering. On the morning on June 7, 2010 Rayo collapsed during breakfast at his home in Roldanillo, according to the testimony of one of his assistants, Alejandro Mendoza. At the time his wife √Ågueda and daughter Sara were at Sara's home in Cali. Rayo was taken to the local hospital where the cause of the collapse was identified as another heart attack. At the hospital he was revived and transferred by ambulance to a hospital in the departmental capital Cali, but during the journey near the city of Palmira, Rayo's condition deteriorated and his vital signs were lost; he was pronounced dead on arrival at the Valle de Lili hospital in Cali.

Riegels are also known as rock bars, thresholds, and verrous. They are found in glaciated valleys, and are often associated with waterfalls and zones of rapids when streams are present. When multiple riegels are stacked in a series they are referred to as a glacial stairway. Most riegels can be identified by having smooth faces on the up- valley sides, while the down-valley sides show signs of having been plucked (eroded by the removal of rocks and blocks from the bedrock).

It is 9 km northeast of the village of Rikitea. Totegegie is one of Mangareva island's reefs, approximately from Rikitea, the island's administrative settlement. It has the only building on the reef. The airport is from Tahiti and is classified as a territorial aerodrome. Its only commercial service is to Tahiti's Fa'a'ƒÅ International Airport on Tuesdays. Totegegie Airport is crucial in its role as the outside world's link to Pitcairn Island. One of the only ways a traveler can reach Pitcairn is to fly to Tahiti, then to Totegegie. From there, a 32-hour boat ride will take one to Pitcairn. History The runway was constructed in 1967 by the 115th running of the Society of the Pacific Experimentation Centre Pacific (CEP). The first aircraft, a Piper Aztec, landed in 1968. The same year, a DC-6 performed weekly service between Totegegie, Mururoa and Papeete. In 1978, the first commercial air link was established between Totegegie and Papeete.http://gadper.free.fr/public/Polynesie/les_anciens_racontent/Construction%20de%20la%20piste%20de%20Totegegie%20en%201967-1.pdf The French army buildings were decommissioned in 1998.

It is considered an advancement of STRIPS. Edwin Pednault (a specialist in the field of Data abstraction and modelling who has been an IBM Research Staff Member in the Data Abstraction Research Group since 1996l) proposed this language in 1987. It is an example of an action language. Origins Pednault observed that the expressive power of STRIPS was susceptible to being improved by allowing the effects of an operator to be conditional. This is the main idea of ADL-A, which is basically the propositional fragment of the ADL proposed by Pednault,Pednault. Formulating multi-agent dynamic-world problems in the classical planning framework. In Michael Georgeff and Amy Lansky, editors, Reasoning about actions and plans pages 47-82. Morgan Kaufmann, San Mateo, CA, 1987. with ADL-B an extension of -A. In the -B extension, actions can be described with indirect effects by the introduction of a new kind of propositions: ‚Äùstatic laws\\". A third variation of ADL is ADL-C which is similar to -B, in the sense that its propositions can be classified into static and dynamic laws, but with some more particularities.Michael Gelfond, Vladimir Lifschitz (1998) \\"Action Languages \\", Link√∂ping Electronic Articles in Computer and Information Science, vol 3, nr 16. The sense of a planning language is to represent certain conditions in the environment and, based on these, automatically generate a chain of actions which lead to a desired goal. A goal is a certain partially specified condition. Before an action can be executed its preconditions must be fulfilled; after the execution the action yields effects, by which the environment changes. The environment is described by means of certain predicates, which are either fulfilled or not. Contrary to STRIPS, the principle of the open world applies with ADL: everything not occurring in the conditions is unknown (Instead of being assumed false). In addition, whereas in STRIPS only positive literals and conjunctions are permitted, ADL allows negative literals and disjunctions as well. Syntax of ADL An ADL schema consists of an action name, an optional parameter list and four optional groups of clauses labeled Precond, Add, Delete and Update. The Precond group is a list of formulae that define the preconditions for the execution of an action. If the set is empty the value \\"TRUE\\" is inserted into the group and the preconditions are always evaluated as holding conditions. The Add and Delete conditions are specified by the Add and Delete groups, respectively. Each group consists of a set of clauses of the forms shown in the left-hand column of the figure 1: # The R represents a relation symbol # œÑ1, ..., œÑn represents terms # œà represents a formula # The sequence z1, ..., zk are variable symbols that appear in the terms œÑ1, ..., œÑn, but not in the parameter list of the action schema # x1, ..., xn are variable symbols that are different from the variables z1, ..., zn and do not appear in œÑ1, ..., œÑn, œà, or the parameter list of the action schema The Update groups are used to specify the update conditions to change the values of function symbols. An Update group consists of a set of clauses of the forms shown in the left column of the figure 2: Semantics of ADL The formal semantic of ADL is defined by 4 constraints. The first constraint is that actions may not change the set of objects that exist in the world; this means that for every action Œ± and every current-state/next-state pair (s, t) ‚àà a, it must be the case that the domain of t should be equal to the domain of s. The second constraint is that actions in ADL must be deterministic. If (s, t1) and (s, t2) are current- state/next-state pairs of action ‚àÉ, then it must be the case that t1 = t2. The third constraint incorporated into ADL is that the functions introduced above must be representable as first-order formulas. For every n-ary relation symbol R, there must exist a formula Œ¶aR(x1,... ,xn) with free variables x2, ..., xn such that faR(s) is given by: : t(R) = f^a_R(s) = (d_1, \\\\ldots, d_n) \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Dom}(s)^n \\\\mid s[d_1/x_1, \\\\ldots, d_n/x_n \\\\models \\\\Phi^a_R(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n)] Consequently, F(n1, ..., xn) = y will be true after performing action = if and only if Œ¶aR (x1, ..., xn,y) was true beforehand. Note that this representability requirement relies on the first constraint (domain of f should be equal to domain of s). The fourth and final constraint incorporated into ADL is that set of states in which an action is executable must also be representable as a formula. For every action Œ± that can be represented in ADL, there must exist a formula Œ†a with the property that s = Œ†a if and only if there is some state t for which (s, t) ‚àà Œ± (i.e. action Œ± is executable in state s) Complexity of planning In terms of computational efficiency, ADL can be located between STRIPS and the Situation Calculus.Edwin P. D. Pednault. ADL. \\"Exploring the Middle Ground Between STRIPS and the Situation Calculus.\\" In Proceedings of KR-89, 324‚Äì332. Any ADL problem can be translated into a STRIPS instance ‚Äì however, existing compilation techniques are worst-case exponential.Gazen, B. C. and Knoblock, C. A., \\"Combining the Expressivity of UCPOP with the efficiency of Graphplan.\\" In ECP97, pp. 221233. Toulouse, France. 1997 This worst case cannot be improved if we are willing to preserve the length of plans polynomially,Nebel, B., \\"On the Compilability and Expressive Power of Propositional Planning Formalisms.\\" Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 12, 271315. 2000 and thus ADL is strictly more brief than STRIPS. ADL planning is still a PSPACE-complete problem. Most of the algorithms polynomial space even if the preconditions and effects are complex formulae.Jorge A. Baier., \\"Effective Search Techniques for Non-Classical Planning via Reformulation.\\" Ph.D. thesis, University of Toronto, 2003. Most of the top-performing approaches to classical planning internally utilize a STRIPS like representation. In fact most of the planners (FF, LPG, Fast- Downward, SGPLAN5 and LAMA) first translate the ADL instance into one that is essentially a STRIPS one (without conditional or quantified effects or goals).  Comparison between STRIPS and ADL  # The STRIPS language only allows positive literals in the states, while ADL can support both positive and negative literals. For example, a valid sentence in STRIPS could be Rich ‚àß Beautiful. The same sentence could be expressed in ADL as ¬¨Poor ‚àß ¬¨Ugly # In STRIPS the unmentioned literals are false. This is called the closed-world assumption. In ADL the unmentioned literals are unknown. This is known as the Open World Assumption. # In STRIPS we only can find ground literals in goals. For instance, Rich ‚àß Beautiful. In ADL we can find quantified variables in goals. For example, ‚àÉx At (P1, x) ‚àß At(P2, x) is the goal of having P1 and P2 in the same place in the example of the blocks # In STRIPS the goals are conjunctions, e.g., (Rich ‚àß Beautiful). In ADL, goals may involve conjunctions and disjunctions (Rich ‚àß (Beautiful ‚à® Smart)). # In STRIPS the effects are conjunctions, but in ADL conditional effects are allowed: when P:E means E is an effect only if P is satisfied # The STRIPS language does not support equality. In ADL, the equality predicate (x = y) is built in. # STRIPS does not have support for types, while in ADL it is supported (for example, the variable p : Person). The expressiveness of the STRIPS language is constrained by the types of transformations on sets of formulas that can be described in the language. Transformations on sets of formulas using STRIPS operators are accomplished by removing some formulas from the set to be transformed and adding new additional formulas. For a given STRIPS operator the formulas to be added and deleted are fixed for all sets of formulas to be transformed. Consequently, STRIPS operators cannot adequately model actions whose effects depend on the situations in which they are performed. Consider a rocket which is going to be fired for a certain amount of time. The trajectory may vary not only because of the burn duration but also because of the velocity, mass and orientation of the rocket. It cannot be modelled by means of a STRIPS operator because the formulas that would have to be added and deleted would depend on the set of formulas to be transformed.Edwing P.D. Pednault. ADL and the State- Transition Model of Action Although an efficient reasoning is possible when the STRIPS language is being used it is generally recognized that the expressiveness of STRIPS is not suitable for modeling actions in many real world applications. This inadequacy motivated the development of the ADL language.H. J. Levesque and R. J. Brachman. A fundamental tradeoff in knowledge representation and reasoning. In Readings in Knowledge Representation, H. J. Levesque and R. J. Brachman, eds, pp. 42‚Äì70. Morgan Kaufmann, San Mateo, CA, 1985.Vladimir Lifschitz and Arkady Rabinov. Miracles in formal theories of actions. Artificial Intelligence, 626(3):89‚Äì116. 1986 ADL expressiveness and complexity lies between the STRIPS language and the situation calculus. Its expressive power is sufficient to allow the rocket example described above to be represented yet, at the same time, it is restrictive enough to allow efficient reasoning algorithms to be developed. As an example in a more complex version of the blocks world: It could be that block A is twice as big as blocks B and C, so the action xMoveOnto(B,A) might only have the effect of negating Clear(A) if On(A,C) is already true, or creating the conditional effect depending on the size of the blocks. This kind of conditional effects would be hard to express in STRIPS notation without the conditional effects.  Example  Consider the problem of air freight transport, where certain goods must be transported from an airport to another airport by plane and where airplanes need to be loaded and unloaded. The necessary actions would be loading, unloading and flying; over the descriptors one could express and whether a freight c is in an airplane p and whether an object x is at an airport A. The actions could be defined then as follows: Action ( Load (c: Freight, p: Airplane, A: Airport) Precondition: At(c, A) ^ At(p, A) Effect: ¬¨At(c, A) ^ In(c, p) ) Action ( Unload (c: Freight, p: Airplane, A: Airport) Precondition: In(c, p) ^ At(p, A) Effect: At(c, A) ^ ¬¨In(c, p) ) Action ( Fly (p: Airplane, from: Airport, to: Airport) Precondition: At(p, from) Effect: ¬¨At(p, from) ^ At(p, to) ) See also * Action language * Action selection * Hierarchical task network * Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) References Category:Robot programming languages Category:Programming languages created in 1987 ","title":"Action description language"},{"id":"9889693","text":"Marcel Detienne (October 11, 1935 in Li√®ge, Belgium ‚Äì March 21, 2019 in Nemours, France) was a Belgian historian and specialist in the study of ancient Greece.

He played for the Green Bay Packers, Buffalo Bills, Atlanta Falcons, and Detroit Lions. Early years Born in Mobile, Alabama, Hunter graduated from Vigor High School in Prichard. During his senior year, he led the Wolves to an 8‚Äì2 record. Hunter received All-State, All-Southern, and All-American honors. He played college football at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, where he set numerous passing records under coach Bear Bryant. After Hunter left, the Crimson Tide switched to the run-oriented Wishbone offense in 1971. College career In 1966, freshmen were prohibited by the NCAA to play on the varsity squad. Hunter played on an all-freshmen team called the Baby Tide. The team was coached by Clem Gryska and went 4‚Äì0. In 1968, he led the Crimson Tide to an 8‚Äì3 record. One of the highlights for Hunter was playing in his backyard at Mobile's Ladd Stadium, when Alabama defeated Southern Miss 17-14. Hunter started the game and threw for a touchdown to give the Tide a victory. In 1969, Alabama hosted the Ole Miss Rebels in a nationally televised game on October 4, in prime time for ABC. The game received legendary status for its back-and-forth scoring, as both the Tide and Rebels set offensive records. Hunter was 22 for 29, for 300 yards passing and a touchdown, while adding another touchdown on the ground. Alabama won 33‚Äì32, and finished with a 6‚Äì5 record. His senior year in 1970 saw him sharing quarterback duties with Neb Hayden. The Tide went 6‚Äì5 during the regular season, ending it with an invitation to the Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl against Oklahoma. Hunter got Alabama on the scoreboard first, with a touchdown pass to Randy Moore. After trailing 21‚Äì7, Hunter threw another touchdown pass to David Bailey to make it a 7-point deficit at halftime, and the game ended in a 24‚Äì24 tie. Professional career Hunter was selected in the sixth round of the 1971 NFL Draft by the Green Bay Packers, the 140th overall pick. He was chosen by the Packers, under first-year head coach Dan Devine, because of his similarities in pedigree with the aging Green Bay legend Bart Starr, also out of Alabama. Hunter played most of the 1972 season, leading the Packers to their last divisional title until the Brett Favre era. Hunter played for eight seasons in the NFL. As a back-up to the hobbled veteran Starr, Hunter started ten games as a rookie in 1971 and completed 75 passes in 163 attempts, with seven touchdowns against seventeen interceptions. Though he again had more interceptions than touchdown passes, Hunter showed signs of improvement in 1972, with Starr now as the quarterback coach, leading a run-oriented offense and Green Bay to a 10‚Äì4 record, their first division title and playoff appearance since 1967. He regressed the next year, and started only five games, replaced by Jerry Tagge. After signing a multi-year deal in May 1974, Hunter was traded in July to the Buffalo Bills, where he was the back-up to Joe Ferguson. He never started a game for the Bills, and made only one appearance during the entire season. He was waived during the 1975 training camp and did not play in the NFL that season. Hunter's career was given new life in Atlanta in 1976. With the previous year's top draft pick Steve Bartkowski benched, Hunter started six games. For the first time in his career, he threw more touchdowns than interceptions, with 5 touchdowns and 4 interceptions. Hunter started seven games in 1977, until Bartkowski returned from knee surgery and took over as the full-time starter. Hunter was released after the season, and did not play in the NFL in 1978. His last season in the NFL was 1979 with the Detroit Lions, where he backed up Gary Danielson and Jeff Komlo, then was released after the season. For his NFL career, Hunter completed 335 of 748 passes for 4,756 yards, with 23 touchdown passes and 38 interceptions.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/players/H/HuntSc00.htm After football Hunter returned to Alabama and worked as a sportscaster in Mobile for nearly two decades. He worked for WKRG-TV, the CBS affiliate, and then for WPMI-TV, the NBC affiliate. He then worked as an investment broker. He also co-hosts a seasonal radio show on WNSP 105.5 FM called \\"Talkin' Football\\" (pronounced Tawlkin-Football) with former Auburn lineman, Tracy Turner and legendary WNSP personality, Dave Schultz. Scott remains great friends with Archie Manning to this day and the two have extracontinental text conversations when Archie is in Europe. Hunter is known for \\"dropping it in the bucket\\" and being one of three Alabama quarterbacks (Blake Sims) and (Tua Tagovailoa) to throw for 400 yards in a game. He commonly refers to former Alabama QB, Tua Tagovailoa, simply as \\"Tua\\". Hunter is famous for \\"Keeping It Between the Lines\\" and not allowing coaching hot seat talk or \\"who danced with who on Saturday night\\" to derail conversations. Prior to its closure, \\"Talkin' Football\\" was frequently hosted from John Word's Captain's Table, which was in the shadow of the USS Alabama. Scott would often say that their steaks were \\"so big that they hang off your plate\\". Hunter is a commercial pilot with over 4,000 flying hours. He flies a Cessna 182.

He committed suicide in prison after having been publicly accused of homosexual practices and the \\"corruption of youth.\\" Early life Rutha was born in Reichenberg, Austria-Hungary (modern Liberec, Czech Republic). A prominent landscape feature where he was growing up was the Devil's Wall (German Teufelsmauer, Czech ƒåertova Stƒõna) a huge outcrop of volcanic black rock that resembles a wall reaching more than thirty feet high and running over 20 miles that local legend had it was built by the Devil to keep the quarreling ethnic Germans and Czechs of Bohemia apart after a farmer sold his soul in exchange for the wall being, saying he would rather burn in hell forever rather than deal with his neighbors.Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 pages 12-13 For reasons that remain unclear, the devil features in a disproportionate number of Bohemian folk tales, both German and Czech.Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 page 12 The Devil's Wall become a symbol of the German-Czech dispute as the people living north of the wall tended to speak German while the people living south of the wall tended to speak Czech.Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 page 13 Rutha was born in and grew up in Sudetenland region of the Austrian Crownland of Bohemia, whose politics were dominated by a conflict between the nationalism of the Czech majority who challenged the dominant position of the German minority.Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 pages 13-14 In their turn, the v√∂lkisch ideology from Germany, which praised the Germans as the Aryan Herrnvolk (\\"master race\\") while denigrating all Slavs as untermensch (\\"sub-humans\\") was very popular with the ethnic Germans of Bohemia as it was used to justify their traditionally dominant position. The same year that Rutha was born, 1897, had seen widespread rioting by the German minority in protest against a law passed by the Austrian Reichsrat declaring that henceforward Bohemia was to be bilingual with Czech having the same status as German.Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 pages 19-20 Rutha grew up in this atmosphere of German-Czech conflict, and as an ethnic German saw his role in promoting the German language and culture in Bohemia.Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 page 27 Rutha's father, like other ethnic Germans in Bohemia, had v√∂lkisch inclinations, and Rutha was later to praise the Devil's Wall as a barrier that protected the Germans of the Sudetenland from the Czech \\"Slavic flood\\" that threatened to wash them away.Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 pages 27-28 Rutha's mother, who he idealized, was ethnic German, but of Czech descent, and at her insistence he learned some Czech and when was 11 was sent to the town of M√ºnchengr√§tz (modern Mnichovo Hradi≈°tƒõ, Czech Republic) south of the Devil's Wall to improve his Czech.Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 pages 28-29 Rutha was later to write that his time in M√ºnchengr√§tz with the worse time in his life as he felt out of place with the Czechs who were to him a \\"foreign\\" people.Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 page 28 A charismatic man with a romantic streak, Rutha joined the Wandervogel (\\"Wandering Birds\\")-an early German- nationalist youth movement- group shortly before the First World War, which became his passion.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 320. Bohemia was the scene of a heated conflict between the German minority vs. the Czech majority, and as an ethnic German in Bohemia, Rutha had pressed for his Wandervogel group to take on a strongly nationalistic outlook.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 320. A major part of the message of Rutha's Wandervogel, which went out on wanderungen (expeditions) to the countryside was that only Germans could properly appreciate the beauty of the countryside and mountains of the Sudetenland, which was a way of asserting a sort of claim on ownership on Bohemia.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 320.

For Rutha, his experience of the war confirmed to the value of the male bonding promoted by the Wandervogel movement, of the necessity of charismatic leadership to hold a group of men together and of the v√∂lkisch concept of all life as a struggle to survive.Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 page 89 At one moment, when Rutha found himself face to face with a trench full of corpses, he felt that he passed through the fire of the \\"apocalypse\\" and had been \\"reborn\\".Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 page 89 In 1918, Rutha recorded in his diary a struggle over his sexuality, attempting to deny his homosexuality, calling such feelings \\"unnatural\\" while admitting to his obsessive love for his \\"blood brothers\\".Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 pages 86-87 One of his \\"blood brothers\\" from the Wandervogel was a Hans Martin, whom Rutha called his \\"dearest lad\\" who was killed in action in 1918.Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 page 86 Another \\"blood brother\\" was a man identified only as F√∂rster, whom Rutha had last seen in 1916, but whose memory was cherished by him.Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 page 86 Rutha wrote an imaginary letter to F√∂rster in his diary of their \\"devoted moments, your hand held in mine as we sit and talk in the quiet twilight...For I am a piece of yourself: our experience, our feelings, our striving upwards will lie naked before us\\".Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 page 86 Later, Rutha wrote in his imaginary letter to F√∂rster: \\"Common, impure men who in their filth see nothing as pure, would perhaps-not certainly-class my feelings for you as unnatural\\".Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 page 87 During a period of leave in August 1918, Rutha attended a wandervogel festival in the Sudeten mountains, which he met a teenager named Ernst Juppe, whose \\"wonderfully developed body\\" caused him to be constantly sexually aroused.Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 page 8 While taking a walk in the mountains while locking arms, Juppe told Rutha that he had given up masturbation, and as a result no longer had feelings for men while Rutha told him about his struggle over sexuality.Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 page 88 On 16 October 1918, Rutha was promoted from private to corporal.Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 page 89 Rutha later wrote on that night, he went walking through the trenches on a night without stars, knowing that in front of him was \\"uncertain emptiness\\" and behind him the \\"chaos of a gigantic collapse\\".Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 page 89 In late October 1918, the Italians started a new offensive which caused the collapse of the Imperial Austrian and Royal Hungarian Army, which simply disintegrated with men abandoning their posts to head home.Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 page 89 In 1919, Rutha returned home to the Sudetenland, which together with the rest of the Austrian crownland of Bohemia was now part of the new republic of Czechoslovakia, a state that Rutha was very hostile to.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 320. Political career Active in the Wandervogel, Rutha came to envision his own ideas of a \\"M√§nnerbund,\\" influenced in part by the rise of national self- awareness on the part of the Sudeten Germans after the collapse of Austria- Hungary. Opposed to Czechoslovakia, Rutha believed that the solution to the problems facing the Sudeten German community was a M√§nnerbund, an elite group of \\"heroic\\" men who united by charismatic leadership and intense male bonding would provide the necessary leadership to \\"save\\" the Sudeten Germans.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 320. In 1921, inspired by the \\"male bonding\\" notions of the gay German poet Stefan George, he created the Jungenschaft, his own section within the Wandervogel. Like George, Rutha saw ancient Greece as a model to emulate, noting that the ancient Greeks had idealized male bonding and beauty.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 320. George had promoted the notion of \\"Hellenic Germans\\", namely a group of romantic, handsome young men who would be the \\"heroic\\" elite, a concept that Rutha embraced.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 321. Rutha always denied his sexuality in public, and he never embraced the politics of the early German gay rights campaigner Adolf Brand, but much of Rutha's style was inspired by Brand.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 322. To counter the popular stereotype of gay men as weak and effeminate, Brand had promoted a \\"hard\\", macho image for himself and his followers. Like Brand, Rutha glorified ancient Greece, male bonding, and the male body; embraced eroticism as a sort of life force that could be channeled; and promoted a \\"hard\\" macho style with his followers encouraged to engage in physical fitness and to be tough.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 322. The wandervogel group that Rutha led on various camping trips out to the Sudeten mountains and forests where they read poetry, sang German folk and nationalist songs, admired the beauty of nature, and cultivated male bonding was entirely male as Rutha refused to accept women as members.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 pages 321-322. Rutha in public denied that he was gay, but contemporaries noted that the open homoeroticism of Rutha's wandervogel group that fetishized the beauty of the male body.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 322. Despite Rutha's vehement denials, evidence that came out in 1937 does suggest that homosexual sex was part of the camping trips in the wildness of the Sudetes mountains.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 pages 326-327. Greatly influenced by the theories of the conservative Catholic Austrian philosopher Othmar Spann and by his own reading of Plato's book The Republic, Rutha envisioned a German-dominated society emerging in Bohemia that would be organized hierarchically along corporatist lines.Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 pages 123-125 Rutha saw his M√§nnerbund as playing the same role in this proposed new society that Plato had envisioned for his elite in The Republic.Cornwall, Mark The Devil's Wall The Nationalist Youth Mission of Heinz Rutha, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2012 pages 122-127 In 1926, Rutha and his group left the Wandervogel and joined the Sudeten Turnverbund (Gymnastics League), where Konrad Henlein was one of his disciples. Rutha was also active in the elitist and covert Kameradschaftsbund organization. Later he joined the Sudeten German Party (SdP), as did many other members of the Kameradschaftsbund. Rutha wanted the Sudetenland to become autonomous in Czechoslovakia and was opposed to the grossdeutschland group led by Karl Hermann Frank who wanted the Sudetenland to join Germany.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 324. Arrest In 1937, the Czechoslovak media published stories charging Rutha with homosexual practices, based on police interrogations of young men employed at Rutha's furniture manufacturing plant. The scandal began in August 1937 when the police in Reichenberg arrested a young man named Wilhelm Purm who was a SdP member and was believed to working as a low-level spy for Germany.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 327. Purm denied being a spy, and also blurted out that he was not a homosexual, which struck the police as unusual since that allegation was not part of their investigation.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 327. Intrigued, the police pressed Purm on why he thought they thought he was gay, which led him to mention that many men in the SdP were gay and that Rutha was an \\"ein warmer Bruder\\" (\\"a warm brother\\"-German slang for an older gay man who makes advances on younger men).Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 327. On the basis of this the police opened an investigation of Rutha. Rutha lived in the village of Bad Kunnersdorf (modern Laznƒõ Kundratice, Czech Republic) where he ran a furniture-manufacturing shop out of a former mill, and employed dozens of men.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 327. The police interviewed one former apprentice at Rutha's workshop, Franz Veitenhensel, who wrote that when he was 15 years old in 1935 and working as an apprentice at the shop, Rutha would invite him to his home above his shop, where: \\"First, he gave me something to eat, then he read to me (chiefly Stefan George and H√∂lderlin) and finally it came to mutual gratification: namely he played with my genitals until I ejaculated, or he took my penis into his mouth and sucked on it until the semen came out, which-as far I could tell-he swallowed\\".Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 327. Based on Veitenhensel's statement, the police arrested dozens of other young men who active in Rutha's youth group, who told similar stories.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 328. Another man active in Rutha wandervogel group, the 20 year-old Werner Weiss, told the police Rutha often had him spent the night in his apartment and during which time, the two had kissed and engaged in mutual masturbation.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 pages 328-329. Weiss told the police that Rutha would come into his bed and: \\"After a short conversation, he persuaded me to let him take my sexual organ in his hand and in this way he produced an ejaculation. At his request, I did the same for him\\".Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 328. On 6 October 1937, Rutha was arrested in his office at his workshop/home on charges of violating paragraph 129 of the Czechoslovak legal code, which was a carry-over from an Austrian law passed in 1852 which made it illegal for \\"any act where sexual gratification is sought or found on the body of the same sex\\".Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 pages 322-323. After his arrest, the police opened the safe in Rutha's office containing his will, which he had written in 1930.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 329. In his will, Rutha had asked: \\"My coffin should be borne by six of our best and most beautiful young men. Leave me alone with them for a hour or a night, before I have to go. If I am still among them, then I will know that I am still alive even if my body is dead\\".Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 329. Under questioning, Rutha admitted that he was very close to the teenage boys who were following him; to buying them presents for their birthdays; on taking on trips to museums and art galleries to teach them about German and ancient Greek art; on inviting them to his home to teach philosophy and literature; but vehemently having any sort of erotic relationships with his followers.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 329. Tellingly, Rutha told the police: \\"I don't regard myself as a homosexual and I have never had homosexual intercourse\\".Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 330. Rutha never came to trial, for he hanged himself in a prison in B√∂hmisch-Leipa (modern ƒåesk√° L√≠pa, Czech Republic) on 4 November 1937. A Helleneophile to the end, Rutha in his suicide note compared himself to Socrates, whom had killed himself after being found guilty of corrupting the youth of Athens.Cornwall, Mark \\" Heinrich Rutha and the Unraveling of a Homosexual Scandal in 1930s Czechoslovakia\\" pages 319-347 from GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies , Volume 8, Issue 3, 2002 page 330. Twelve other young men connected to Rutha were still brought to trial by the Czech authorities, of whom ten were convicted and several sentenced to jail terms. Many other investigations of the Youth Movement were started (most notably scrutinizing the sexual activities of Walter Brand). The direct political aftermath was that Konrad Henlein, as leader of the SdP, had to start making political concessions to the National Socialist wing of the party. In the following years, the National Socialists invoked the charges against Rutha as a handy tool to ostracize and expel many Sudeten separatists out of the SdP. This shifted the balance of power in favor of those who favored Anschluss with Germany.

He had won a scholarship of Rs. 40 per month and joined Calcutta Medical College in 1842, but did not complete his medical education. While a student of Hindu College, amongst his classmates were Rajnarain Bose and Gobinda Chandra Dutt (father of Toru Dutt). When Hindu College was opened, orthodox sections of Hindu society thought that western education would not affect the rigid structure of Hindu society.Raychoudhuri, Subir, The Lost World of the Babus, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol I, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, p. 73, Oxford University Press, They had even forced Ram Mohan Roy to stay out of it.Collet, Sophia Dobson, The Life and Letters of Raja Rammohun Roy, 1900/1988, p. 76, Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. However, ‚Äòthe contradictions between the College‚Äôs name and its secular curriculum soon became evident‚Äô and many students of Hindu College embraced Christianity. Gnanendramohan converted to Christianity in 1851, under the influence of his mentor, Krishna Mohan Banerjee and married his daughter Kamalmani.

On being cured he joined the University of London as professor of Hindu Law and Bengali. In 1861, he was living at Kensington Park Gardens, where he was visited by student and diarist Rakhal Das Haldar on 28 May.

The Lobby is situated immediately south of the Commons Chamber, close to the Central Lobby, and is off-limits to members of the public during voting sessions. It hosts offices of government and opposition whips, who are responsible for organising voting along party lines. Former British prime ministers are honoured with statues and busts in the Lobby. The monuments include: * Four bronze statues, located next to the main doors at either end of the Lobby, portraying David Lloyd George, Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee and Margaret Thatcher. * Three stone statues, located next to the side doors, portraying Benjamin Disraeli, Arthur Balfour and H.

The bronze statue of Thatcher was unveiled in February 2007, and placed close to the bust of her Conservative predecessor Edward Heath. The sculptures of Heath, Thatcher and James Callaghan were added sooner after their premierships than those of previous prime ministers, following a change in the rules on depiction in Parliament so as to allow representation within a person's lifetime, instead of at least 10 years after their death as was previously the case. Following the inclusion of Thatcher, the Commons Works of Art Committee subsequently pursued a special project to commemorate all Prime Ministers to hold office since 1902, searching for monuments to the three who still had yet to be recognised: Cambell-Bannerman, Law and Chamberlain. This project was successfully completed after the addition of a bust of her successor, John Major. A bust of Tony Blair has been approved by the Commons‚Äô Works of Art Committee but no sculptor has yet been chosen. The Committee has also discussed plans for portraits of Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg. The Members' Lobby was restored after its destruction during The Blitz in World War II, as attested by the monogram of King George VI on its doors. The bomb-damaged arch at the entrance to the Commons was retained as a reminder of 10‚Äì11 May 1941; it is now known as the \\"Churchill Arch\\". The feet of Oscar Nemon's bronze statue of Winston Churchill, as well as that of David Lloyd George, which flank the Commons doors, have been eroded, apparently by generations of MPs rubbing them for luck.

Four members of the band - Red Nichols, Jimmy Dorsey, Tommy Dorsey, and Adrian Rollini - went on to front big bands in later decades. The band was formed in 1921 by banjoist Ray Kitchenman. Its members were from Ohio but chose the name California Ramblers. The band was instantly successful and were one of the most prolific recording groups in the 1920s. In late 1924 the Ramblers signed a contract with Columbia Records and then, in conjunction with their manager Ed Kirkeby, agreed to waive all royalties to Columbia for the right to record for other companies under pseudonyms. They recorded for nearly every independent label in the U.S., Canada, and the UK, using over 100 unique aliases.

(Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue)\\" is an American popular song that achieved its greatest popularity in the 1920s. It is sometimes known simply as \\"Has Anybody Seen My Girl?\\" and sometimes simply as \\"Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue\\"; the 1925 Leo Feist, Inc. sheet music gives both of these. Origin Accounts of who originally composed \\"Has Anybody Seen My Girl?\\" vary, particularly since the song, especially its lyrics, was often modified. Some sources state that Percy Wenrich wrote the music and Jack Mahoney the lyrics, in 1914.They are so credited at International Lyrics Playground. Credit for the most popular version of the song, though, is given to Ray Henderson for the music, and Sam M. Lewis and Joseph Widow Young for the lyrics. It was this version that was recorded by The California Ramblers in 1925. Recordings The song was first recorded by The California Ramblers in 1925, and has been covered by many other artists since, including Shane Fenton and the Fentones, Arthur Fields, Tiny Hill, Guy Lombardo, Mitch Miller, Dean Martin, Freddy Cannon, Mickey Gilley, Milla Jovovich, and Tim Waurick. Nick Lucas sang the song in a recording that was used in the 1974 movie The Great Gatsby. Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album On the Happy Side (1962). Gene Austin had a #1 in 1926 with his version (Titled: \\"Five Foot Two Eyes Of Blue\\".). Cultural appearances The 1952 Hollywood comedy film \\"Has Anybody Seen My Gal?\\" was set in the 1920s and used the song, among a few others from that era, but these musical touches were unrelated to the plot. The song was the theme song for TV's The Ina Ray Hutton Show during the 1950s. The song was featured in the 1936 Our Gang short film \\"The Pinch Singer\\", performed by a fictional group named \\"The Plantation Trio\\". Lucille Ball performs this song in an episode of I Love Lucy, and also in the episode of The Lucy Show titled \\"Lucy's College Reunion\\", in both performances playing the ukulele. In 1984, it was used by the Walter Mondale 1984 presidential campaign to introduce vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro (who was actually five feet, four inches).https://cornerstone.lib.mnsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1240&context;=speaker- gavel More recently used in CSI: Cyber Season one, episode eight, \\"Selfie 2.0\\", the song was referenced when the agents were profiling victims; and, was used as dance music in the 2018 semi-final of Strictly Come Dancing by Stacey Dooley, and her professional partner Kevin Clifton.  Lyrics  The Jack Mahoney lyrics (1914) are the same as the chorus used in the Sam M. Lewis & Joseph Widow Young version (1925). Minor variations exist in recorded versions ‚Äî for example, \\"pearls\\" and \\"hers\\" instead of \\"fur\\" and \\"her\\". Five foot two, eyes of blue, But oh! what those five foot could do, Has anybody seen my girl? Turned-up nose, turned-down hose, Flapper, yes sir, one of those, Has anybody seen my girl? Now if you run into a five-foot-two Covered with fur, Diamond rings, and all those things, Bet your life it isn't her, But could she love, could she woo, Could she, could she, could she coo!

In 1998, he had a 3-week trial with 1994/95 English Premier League Champions Blackburn Rovers F.C. This side, managed by Roy Hodgson, included such players as Chris Sutton, Damien Duff, Colin Hendry and Martin Dahlin. Ithier was refused the relevant work permit however. He was sent to play for the English First Division (now EFL Championship) side Walsall F.C. whilst processing his work permit, but without the European heritage to play in Europe, Ithier returned and focussed on plying his trade in Asia. Ithier started his Asian career with 1997 Malaysian Super League champions Sarawak FA with notable players Alistair Edwards and Billy Bone and under the guidance of Alan Vest. His debut game at a sold out Sarawak Stadium was in 1998 Malaysia Charity Shield against Selangor FA in which Sarawak FA won 3-1 with 9 players.

The dispute resulted in the removal of Ganguly as captain and his replacement by vice-captain Rahul Dravid in November 2005, with Ganguly being dropped from the ODI team. Ganguly was also dropped from the Test team at the end of January 2006. The dispute stirred up strong emotions in India, ranging from fiery street protests in Ganguly's home town of Kolkata and his home state of West Bengal, to speeches in the Parliament of India. Eventually Ganguly was recalled to the team in both forms of cricket in late 2006 after his replacements lost form, and was selected as a part of the Indian team for the 2007 Cricket World Cup.  Background  Sourav Ganguly Greg Chappell, a former captain of the Australian cricket team, was selected as the new Indian coach, after the incumbent coach John Wright, a former captain of the New Zealand cricket team, did not renew his contract at the end of the 2004/05 international season. India went through an indifferent 2004‚Äì05 season, being eliminated from the Champions Trophy in the Group stage, losing the Border Gavaskar Trophy by a margin of 2-1, their first series loss to Australia on home soil since 1969, squandering a 1‚Äì0 Test series lead against Pakistan to level the series 1-1 and then losing the last four ODIs to lose the ODI series against the same opponents 4‚Äì2. However, John Wright's tenure had also seen India enter the finals of the 2003 Cricket World Cup after a poor start to the tournament, sharing victory in the 2002 Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka, and achieving famous Test wins in England, Australia, Pakistan and the West Indies. John Wright's role in historic victories for India brought importance and prestige to the position of coach in Indian cricket. Chappell was chosen over the other contenders Dav Whatmore, Mohinder Amarnath, Graham Ford, Desmond Haynes, Tom Moody and John Emburey in a highly publicised selection process. Although lacking the experience and coaching credentials of his rivals, Chappell had emerged as the favourite in the media, and secured the appointment with the active support of the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly, who had earlier taken batting tips from Chappell during the successful 2003-04 tour of Australia. Ganguly had put forth Chappell's name twice in April 2005, even when other senior members in the national team were not consulted on the matter. Chappell soon became the centre of the Indian media's attention, and his prominence and dominant personality soon began to clash with Ganguly, who had earned a reputation for being a successful and tough captain. India's first tournament under Chappell was the 2005 Indian Oil Cup in Sri Lanka, with Rahul Dravid captaining the team. This came about after Ganguly was serving a 4 match suspension for slow over rates during the series against Pakistan in early 2005. The tournament saw Chappell introduce young batsmen such as Suresh Raina and Venugopal Rao, due to the suspension of Ganguly and the axing of V. V. S. Laxman. With Ganguly's suspension expiring, he was reinstated as the captain on the tour to Zimbabwe. Ganguly entered the series having not scored a Test century for almost two years since late 2003, when he scored 144 against Australia in Brisbane.  Zimbabwe tour and email leak  The tour began with a warmup game during which Chappell asked Ganguly to step down from the captaincy and focus on his batting. Chappell said that Ganguly's slump in batting form would affect the \\"other areas of his game\\", but expressed confidence about Ganguly regaining his form on the tour. Before the first Test, Chappell stated that they should pick the best XI for the match, and that, if left to him, he would pick both Yuvraj Singh and Mohammad Kaif ahead of Ganguly. Irked by this, Ganguly decided to pack his bags and leave the tour. The team director Amitabh Chowdhary, along with Chappell and Dravid, insisted that he continue to play, as the captain leaving the team in the middle of the tour would be disastrous. After rumours emerged that Ganguly had allegedly faked an injury during the match, he made defiant comments to the media, in which he accused members of team management of trying to pressure him to resign as captain, although he would not name individuals.Cricinfo ‚Äì 'I was asked to step down as captain' ‚Äì Ganguly He stated that the call for him to step down before the Test helped him find the \\"extra determination\\" for this innings. A few days later, reports emerged that Chappell threatened to resign. However, Chappell dismissed these reports by saying, \\"Neither have I threatened to resign nor do I intend to resign\\". He then read out a statement which said that the private discussion with Ganguly was \\"aimed at motivating Sourav for the Bulawayo Test match\\". He also added that he and Ganguly share a \\"strong mutual respect going back a long time\\". Tendulkar commented on the issue saying that the dressing room discussion should have remained private. Later during the tour, Chappell sent an email to the Board of Control for Cricket in India, which criticised Ganguly as being \\"mentally and physically unfit\\" to lead the team. Chappell stated that Ganguly's \\"negative attitude\\" would hamper India's development as a unit for the 2007 World Cup and that the injuries suffered by Ganguly are \\"imaginary\\". He also accused Ganguly of desperately trying to retain captaincy and that he had \\"lost the trust and respect of his teammates\\". The email was leaked, and upon returning to India, both Ganguly and Chappell were summoned to a BCCI board meeting in Mumbai.Cricinfo ‚Äì India awaits judgment day Before the meeting, Ganguly told a Kolkata-based newspaper, \\"I will say whatever I want to to the board. I hope the board will give me a chance to explain. You can imagine the character of a person who within hours of a truce goes and writes such an e-mail.\\". At the conclusion of the meeting, both resolved to work together in the best \\"interests of Indian cricket\\".Cricinfo ‚Äì Chappell and Ganguly both stay Dissent amongst the team became public when off spinner Harbhajan Singh earned the ire of cricket authorities by publicly attacking Chappell and defending Ganguly after the team returned to India. Harbhajan claimed that Chappell used \\"double standards\\" and instilled \\"fear and insecurity\\" into the team. The Punjab Cricket Association called him to explain his actions, but he was not punished after offering an apology. Several members of the Indian team backed Ganguly during this time and were unhappy with the way the matters were handled by Chappell, according to some newspapers. This resulted in a gag order being placed on members of the team.Cricinfo ‚Äì Indian board gags players  Ganguly's ODI omission  In October 2005, Ganguly suffered an injury which forced him to be unavailable for the first four ODIs of a seven match ODI series against the touring Sri Lanka. This delayed a definitive decision on whether Ganguly would continue as Indian captain, with Dravid appointed in his absence. After the team took an unbeatable 4‚Äì0 series lead, the squad was reviewed for the final three matches. Although changes were made to the team, Ganguly was overlooked, and Dravid continued to lead the team for the rest of the series. At the end of the series which India claimed 6‚Äì1, Ganguly was again omitted for the ODI series against South Africa. When the Indian team arrived at Eden Gardens in Calcutta for the third ODI of the series, an angry public greeted the team bus, chanting and waving banners with anti-Chappell and pro-Ganguly sentiment. Cameras captured a middle finger being displayed to the protestors, attributed to be the finger of Chappell. During the match, the Indian team were booed and the South African batsmen were cheered as they accumulated the runs necessary for a ten-wicket victory.  Test retention and omission  Yuvraj Singh, who was competing with Ganguly for the final batting position. When the squad for the subsequent Test series against Sri Lanka was announced, Ganguly was included at the expense of paceman Zaheer Khan. At the time, BCCI chairman of selectors Kiran More justified the inclusion of Ganguly, as a \\"batting all rounder\\", despite Ganguly's Test bowling average being above 50. The announcement also resolved the captaincy issue, with Dravid named as captain, and Virender Sehwag as his deputy. Before the start of the Test series, Yashpal Sharma, who was replaced in the national selection panel, accused Chappell of questioning his integrity and interfering with selection of the team. Following this, Chappell remarked that his spat with Ganguly was \\"blown out of proportion\\" and went on to say, \\"He [Yashpal] was frustrated that he lost a job which he obviously wanted to keep. I had no part in him losing his job, but he had to take it out on someone.\\". Prior to the first Test in Chennai, debate centred on whether batsman Yuvraj Singh, who had been named man of the series against South Africa, would replace Ganguly in the middle order. Ganguly was retained, in a rain affected match, but did not score highly. The Yuvraj-Ganguly debate was taken from the equation for the second Test at Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi, when Sehwag was hospitalised with illness, allowing both to play. Ganguly made 39 and 40 in the Test, while Yuvraj recovered from a first innings duck to score an unbeaten 75 in the second to set up a winning victory target. At the end of the Test, More announced that Ganguly had been dropped from the squad, with Mohammad Kaif replacing him. He justified the decision by stating that it would be inappropriate to leave an experienced player like Ganguly out of the team and on the bench, implying that Ganguly and not Yuvraj would have been dropped on the return of Sehwag. As it turned out, Dravid became ill and was forced to withdraw from the Third Test in Ahmedabad, and Kaif played after being selected with the intention of avoiding Ganguly's humiliation as a reserve batsman. Kaif failed to make a large contribution the Third Test, while Yuvraj scored another half century. Ganguly reportedly cried after being dropped from the team. The decision to drop Ganguly resulted in widespread sympathy and praise for a man who had been previously reviled by the Indian cricket following, resulting in further street protests in Calcutta. This included organised protests by organisations, politicians, including the blockading of rail transport in Bengal. Ganguly's cause was taken up by federal parliamentarians in the Lok Sabha. Despite being dropped from both ODI and Test teams, at the end of December 2006, Ganguly retained his A-grade BCCI contract, although Yuvraj and Kaif, who had replaced him in the Test team and were established members of the ODI team, remained on a B-grade contract.  Pakistan tour  Opening batsmen Gautam Gambhir (pictured) was dropped and Dravid became a makeshift opener to accommodate Ganguly. With the announcement of the team to tour arch rivals Pakistan in January 2006, Ganguly was again recalled to the Test team, with Kaif dropped. Leading up to the first Test in Lahore, this still left Ganguly appearing to be out of the team, with Yuvraj having recorded consecutive half-centuries. After a debate with Chappell and Dravid in the middle of the stadium before the start of the Test which was reported by observers to be heated, Ganguly found himself in the team, after specialist opener Gautam Gambhir was dropped to accommodate him, forcing Dravid to play as a makeshift opener along with Sehwag. On a batting friendly surface, Pakistan amassed more than 650 runs before declaring. Dravid and Sehwag responded with a 410 run opening stand, just three short of the world Test record set by fellow Indians Vinoo Mankad and Pankaj Roy in 1956. The match ended after Sehwag's dismissal, the last of many interruptions due to bad light. As a result, Ganguly did not have an opportunity with the bat. He was subsequently dropped for the Second Test in Faisalabad as India included an extra bowler on another batting friendly pitch, with Dravid continuing as a makeshift opener. After the Faisalabad Test ended in another high scoring draw, the Third Test was held on a green bowler friendly wicket in Karachi. With six batsmen required, Ganguly was recalled instead of the specialist opener Gambhir. India decided to retain Dravid as the makeshift opener, having scored consecutive centuries in the role. Dravid's success did not continue, failing to pass single figures in both innings. The Indian batsmen were unable to cope with the seaming conditions, and lost the Test and series 1‚Äì0. Yuvraj top-scored with a century, while Ganguly managed only 34 and 37, getting out to rash strokes in both innings after playing a few good shots. Critics questioned the tenability of the Dravid opening experiment which accommodated Ganguly in the Test team. Yuvraj further enhanced his standing in the subsequent ODI series, scoring a century and averaging more than 100, being named man of the series for the second consecutive ODI series. Ganguly was not recalled to the ODI team, which continued its recent success with a 4‚Äì1 result.  England series  Ganguly's chances of being selected against England in their March 2006 tour of India received a boost when Yuvraj suffered a hamstring injury which ruled him out of the First Test in Nagpur. This opened a vacancy for Ganguly in the middle order, despite the return of Dravid to the middle order after the opening experiment was discarded and specialist opener Wasim Jaffer was selected. Despite Yuvraj publicly backing Ganguly to replace him in the team, the selectors dropped Ganguly from the squad entirely, recalling Kaif and selecting ODI batsman Suresh Raina for his first Test series. Upon Yuvraj's return from injury, he resumed his position in the middle order, replacing Kaif. Ganguly was again overlooked for the ODI series, as the selectors persisted with the core of the team which had helped defeat Pakistan. They guided India to a comprehensive 5‚Äì1 win over England.  West Indies tour  Despite an injury to Sachin Tendulkar, Ganguly was again overlooked in favour of Kaif and Raina when the Test squad was announced. This effectively left him outside the top eight Test batsmen in the eyes of the BCCI, and was not selected in the ODI team as the selectors persisted with the squad which had recorded 17 wins and five losses since Dravid's appointment. As the team returned to India at the end of the season in July, Ganguly had been out of the team in both forms of the game for five months.  South Africa tour  Following India's poor batting display in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy and the ODI series in South Africa, in which they were whitewashed 4‚Äì0, Ganguly made his comeback to the Test team. Wasim Jaffer, Zaheer Khan and Anil Kumble had earlier been selected for the one-day squad, despite their recent poor performances. Many saw this as an indictment of coach Greg Chappell's youth-first policy. Coming in at 37/4, Ganguly scored 87 in a tour match against the rest of South Africa, modifying his original batting style and taking a middle-stump guard, resulting in India winning the match. During his first Test innings since his comeback, against South Africa in Johannesburg his score of 51 helped India to victory, marking the first Test match win for the team in South Africa. Though India lost the series, Ganguly accumulated the most runs on the scoring chart. After his successful Test comeback he was recalled for the ODI team, as India played host to West Indies and Sri Lanka in back to back ODI tournaments. In his first ODI innings in almost two years, he scored a matchwinning 98.  Ganguly's ODI comeback  Following Ganguly's topping the batting charts in the test series in South Africa, he was recalled for the ODI series against West Indies, and the one that followed which was against Sri Lanka. He performed well in both series, averaging almost 70 and won the Man of the Series Award against Sri Lanka. 2007 World Cup debacle The controversies and tensions surrounding Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell came to an end after India's poor performance and early elimination from the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Ganguly was selected as part of the team under the captaincy of Rahul Dravid. India was seen as one of the favorites to win the tournament, but senior BCCI officials indicated that India's performance would decide the future of Greg Chappell' stormy tenure with the Indian team, and determine the credibility of his coaching methods. India's fortunes were immediately endangered after a stunning defeat to the Bangladesh in its opening group match. Sourav Ganguly top-scored with 66, but he was criticised for scoring at a slow run rate. Although Indian batsmen amassed more than 400 runs for an easy win over the newcomers Bermuda in their second match, Ganguly scoring 87, the media still severely criticised the team leadership and the players. India faced a must- win situation as it faced-off against Sri Lanka in its final group match. Sri Lanka scored more than 250 runs to set a challenging target for the Indian batting order, which failed dramatically. For all practical purposes, India's World Cup campaign ended with its defeat to Sri Lanka, although it was not formally eliminated until Bangladesh achieved its predicted victory over Bermuda in the final group match. Facing a barrage of criticism and public anger, and lack of support from the BCCI, Greg Chappell resigned as India's coach. After much deliberation, the BCCI decided to retain Rahul Dravid as India's captain for the summer of 2007, but chose not to appoint a high- profile coach for the time being. Former Indian players Venkatesh Prasad and Robin Singh were appointed as specialist bowling and fielding coaches respectively, and former Indian captain Ravi Shastri was temporarily appointed as coach-cum-manager for India's tour of Bangladesh. Shastri was succeeded as manager by Chandu Borde for India's tour of England. Aftermath Ganguly emerged with prolific figures in both Test and ODI cricket in the year 2007. He scored 1106 Test runs at an average of 61.44 (with three centuries and four fifties) in 2007 to become the second highest run-scorer in Test matches of that year after Jacques Kallis. He was also the fifth highest run-scorer in 2007 in ODIs, where he scored 1240 runs at an average of 44.28. He formally retired in 2008. In 2008, veteran South African batsman Gary Kirsten was appointed head coach of the national team after a less-publicised selection process. Kirsten brought in Paddy Upton as a mental coach, and Prasad and Singh were retained in their specialist roles. In November 2007, Chappell alleged that he was a victim of a \\"racist attack\\" at the Bhubaneshwar Airport in January 2007 when a fan \\"whacked him\\" behind his ear, and accused the BCCI of covering up the issue. He also went on to say, \\"As I said to the BCCI in a letter, had it been one of the players who was attacked there would have been an outcry, but because it was me no-one seemed to care. The reply came back talking about my racist comments.\\" and added \\"There was a cover-up. Everyone went into cover-up mode. It was quite obvious it was a serious assault. It wasn't just a push in the back as the media was led to believe. The whole thing was played down. The only phone call I got from the BCCI asked me whether it really happened.\\" In response, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah told Cricinfo, \\"No way can it be called racist. We treated the issue just like we would have treated [it with] any other Indian player. I remember calling him and finding out the issue. We also enhanced security and provided adequate protection. The local police also provided us with support.\\" Chappell later downplayed the incident saying his comments came at \\"an emotional time\\". Reactions In November 2014, in his autobiography Playing It My Way, Tendulkar criticised Chappell, calling him a \\"ringmaster who imposed his ideas on the players without showing any signs of being concerned about whether they felt comfortable or not\\". He said that, \\"His attitude to Sourav was astonishing. Chappell is on record as saying that he may have got the job because of Sourav but that did not mean he was going to do favours to Sourav for the rest of his life. Frankly, Sourav is one of the best cricketers India has produced and he did not need favours from Chappell to be part of the team\\". Tendulkar also alleged that months before the 2007 World Cup, Chappell came to Tendulkar's house and asked Tendulkar to take over India captaincy saying \\"together, we could control Indian cricket for years\\". Tendulkar's allegations were supported by former teammates such as Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and V. V. S. Laxman. Zaheer called Chappell a \\"control freak\\" and said, \\"After he was appointed the coach of the Indian team, he once came upto me and told \\"Zaheer, you will not be playing for India till I remain the coach\\". He also added that the two-year term under Chappell was \\"easily the worst and darkest phase\\" that he could remember. Harbhajan said, \\"Chappell destroyed Indian cricket to such an extent that it required at least 3 years to again get back on track. The worst part was some players in that team, who sucked upto the coach and would supply selective misinformation creating bigger rifts\\". He also talked about the email leak, \\"Sourav was batting out there in the middle and this man was typing a critical e-mail against Sourav, sitting right there in that dressing room. He had no interest in the proceedings of the match. There were seven guys that he wanted to get rid of. Sourav was his primary target followed by myself, Virender Sehwag, Ashish Nehra, Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh\\". Laxman was also critical of Chappell in saying that Chappell took Indian cricket \\"backwards\\" during his coaching tenure. Laxman also recalled an incident from 2006, \\"This happened in 2006 at the Wankhede Stadium when India played versus England. Yuvraj Singh was picked ahead of me. We were going to the West Indies for a four-Test series after that and he asked me if I would open. I mentioned in 2000 I had decided I would not open anymore after it didn't work for me in the first four years. I was consistent in the middle order since 2000. Chappell asked me my age and said - Don't you think 31 is too young an age to sit at home? I was astonished to hear this. I had a very good run under him. I was the second highest run scorer under him.\\" In 2015, Mohammad Kaif stated, \\"Chappell questioned my fielding technique and it left me so confused that I dropped a catch in the very next game. Chappell created an atmosphere where the players were backbiting about each other rather than focusing on their performances.\\" In 2017, when he announced his retirement Ashish Nehra recalled, \\"I didn't play much under Greg Chappell save two series in 2005. I knew biryani would turn into khichdi under Greg.\\" In 2018, Virender Sehwag revealed that he was the one who had informed Ganguly of Chappell's email. In an earlier interview, Sehwag claimed that, \\"The thing with Chappell was that whatever you shared with him, it was promptly disclosed to media and selectors. He talked and that hurt the trust. I wasn't comfortable with him.\\" In another interview Sehwag had stated that Chappell's man-management skills were \\"absolutely nil.\\". In June 2020, Harbhajan Singh in conversation with Aakash Chopra claimed that Greg Chappell had a divide and rule policy and said, ‚Äú2007 50-over World Cup has to be the lowest point of my career. I thought we are going through such a difficult time and I also thought that maybe it is not the right time to play for India, wrong people were at the helm of Indian cricket. Who is Greg Chappell and what is he trying to do. Greg Chappell had a divide and rule policy, he used to do such things.‚Äù  References  Category:Indian cricket in the 21st century Category:Cricket controversies ","title":"Chappell‚ÄìGanguly controversy"},{"id":"9890051","text":"The Heckler & Koch HK45 (Heckler & Koch, .45 ACP) is a semi-automatic pistol designed by the German arms manufacturer Heckler & Koch. Overview The HK45 was designed to meet requirements set forth in the U.S. Military Joint Combat Pistol program which had the purpose of arming the U.S. Military with a .45 ACP semi-automatic pistol instead of the 9mm M9 pistol. The Joint Combat Pistol program was suspended indefinitely in 2006, and the M9 pistol remained the standard issue handgun for the U.S. Military (replaced by the Sig P320 in January, 2017). Even though the Joint Combat Pistol program had ended, HK decided to make the HK45 available on the commercial market as well as to law enforcement and military groups. Heckler & Koch, along with Larry Vickers, an ex-Delta Force operator, and Ken Hackathorn led the development of the HK45 to meet Joint Combat Pistol program requirements which was canceled due to the price of re-arming the entire military. The HK45 represents an evolutionary advancement of the Heckler & Koch USP,Title: Military Power Author Fred J. Pushies Edition illustrated Publisher MBI Publishing Company, 2007 , page 99 and shares the same operating principles of that weapon. It is available in the same ten variants as the USP. The HK45 is a full size model pistol, but significant effort went towards making it more ergonomic than the HK USP full- size chambered in .45 ACP by incorporating features found on the Heckler & Koch P2000. These include an extended ambidextrous slide release, a textured ergonomic grip with finger grooves, and interchangeable backstraps to fit differently sized hands. The newer grip and backstraps allow the pistol to sit lower into the web of the hand, contributing to greater control of the weapon and recoil management. In order to accommodate the smaller, more ergonomic grip, the HK45 has a magazine capacity of 10 rounds versus 12 rounds for the USP45. The HK45 also added grip serrations on the front end of the slide, a Picatinny rail in front of the trigger guard for mounting accessories, and an O-ring polygonal barrel similar to the USP Expert and Match models and the Mark 23 for more consistent lock-up of the slide and barrel during cycling and increased accuracy. At least one HK45C Tactical was used in Operation Neptune Spear. The HK45 is also the first weapon to be manufactured at Heckler & Koch's new facility in Newington, New Hampshire. Variants Heckler & Koch also manufactures the HK45 Compact (HK45C), which can use an 8-round and a 10-round magazine. The HK45C features the same improvements as the full-size HK45, but has a more conventional straight grip similar to Heckler & Koch's P2000. This design still allows the user to customize the grip size via interchangeable backstraps. An HK45 Tactical (HK45T) and HK45 Compact Tactical (HK45CT) are also available; these variants include an extended threaded barrel for suppressors, and tritium front and rear sights.HK45 operator's manual (PDF) Extended threaded barrels compatible with the HK45 and HK45C are also available for purchase from Heckler & Koch USA.HK USA Forums - HK45 and HK45C Tactical Barrels Users *: HK45 was adopted by the Tactical Response Group of the Western Australia Police in 2008 *: Unknown variant was purchased for use by the special forces. *: The HK45C / HK45CT was adopted by the United States Naval Special Warfare Command under the designation Mk 24 Mod 0.

He served as the head men's basketball coach at Rowan University from 1989 to 1996, the University of Maine from 1996 to 2004, and La Salle University from 2004 to 2018. Giannini led Rowan to an NCAA Division III Men's Basketball Tournament championship in 1996. Early life The son of Italian immigrants, Giannini grew up in Elmwood Park, a suburb of Chicago, and has three younger brothers. He attended Fenwick High School in Oak Park, and received a bachelor's degree in psychology from North Central College in Naperville. Giannini also holds a master's degree in physical education with a specialization in sports psychology from North Texas University, as well as a doctorate in kinesiology with a specialization in sports psychology from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. Coaching career =Illinois= From 1987 through 1989, Giannini served as a graduate assistant on coach Lou Henson's staff at the University of Illinois. In Giannini's final season on Henson's staff, the Fighting Illini, led by Kendall Gill, Kenny Battle, Stephen Bardo, Tyler Cottingham, Lowell Hamilton and Marcus Liberty, made the Final Four. =Rowan= Giannini's first head coaching job came at Rowan University, a Division III school, when he was hired as the men's coach in 1989. His 1992‚Äì93 team, led by Terrence Stewart, went to the Final Four. Two years later, Giannini's team was the favorite to win the national championship, but again lost in the final four. The following season, Giannini gambled in accepting two Division 1 transfers, a Division 2 transfer and added them to a team centered around Stewart. After a slow start to the season, Rowan caught fire and defeated Hope College to win the 1996 national championship. =Maine= Following Rowan's championship season, Giannini accepted the head coaching position at the University of Maine, a position he held for eight years. His Maine teams made five trips to the America East Conference semi-finals or better, and made appearances in the conference championship game two of Giannini's last three seasons. Giannini's two 20-win seasons are the only two on record in program history, and his .530 winning percentage is the highest in school history. =La Salle= On August 23, 2004, Giannini was hired as the eighteenth head coach of the La Salle men's basketball team. He succeeded Billy Hahn, who was forced to resign that July, following a rape scandal. The university had originally sought to hire Penn head coach and La Salle alumnus Fran Dunphy, but settled on Giannini after Dunphy turned the school down. The 2005‚Äì06 season, Giannini's second at La Salle, set records for most Atlantic 10 wins in a season (ten), most Atlantic 10 road wins in a single season (four) and was the program's first winning season since the 1992‚Äì93 season, when the school competed in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference (now known as the Horizon League). Giannini was named a Jim Phelan Award candidate for National Coach of the Year. However, the 2005‚Äì06 season was one of only two seasons in which La Salle finished above .500 in Giannini's first seven seasons leading the program. Though Giannini recruited heavily in the Philadelphia area, his teams were plagued by poor chemistry and missed opportunities, and La Salle became an afterthought in the Big 5. On March 23, 2018, Giannini and La Salle mutually agreed to part ways after 14 seasons. Postseason breakthroughs The 2011‚Äì12 Explorers won 21 games, the program's highest win total since 1992, and received an invitation to the 2012 NIT, the program's first postseason tournament appearance since 1992. La Salle lost its first-round game at home to eventual tournament runner-up Minnesota. The following season, La Salle again won 21 regular season games, including consecutive victories over ninth-ranked Butler at home, and nineteenth-ranked VCU on the road. The Explorers received their first invitation to the NCAA Tournament since 1992, when they received an at- large bid. In the opening round, La Salle defeated fellow thirteen seed Boise State, before defeating fourth-seeded Kansas State in the second round. After defeating twelfth-seeded Ole Miss in the third round, La Salle lost to Wichita State in the Sweet Sixteen. La Salle's appearance in the Sweet Sixteen made it only the sixth program seeded thirteenth or lower to advance that far, and its three tournament wins were the program's first since 1990. It was also the program's deepest tournament run since 1955, when the Tom Gola-led Explorer's lost in the national championship game. The team's 24 overall victories were the seventh-most in school history, and its 11 victories in the Atlantic Ten were the most ever. The Explorers also finished ranked 24th in the nation in the final USA Today Coaches Poll of the season. Personal life Giannini and his wife Donna have two daughters.

He became the first Richmond player to win the game's most prestigious award, the Brownlow Medal. Judkins played his junior football as a rover for Greensborough and then moved to Northcote in the VFA for the 1926 season. Invited to Richmond the following year, Judkins was forced to remain in the VFA for one more season due to clearance problems, caused by a dispute between the two competitions. Eventually, he made his way to Punt Road in 1928, and he immediately became a first team regular, aged 20. He arrived at the club at the start of a golden era, and starred in the Tigers' semifinal win over Carlton, but was quiet during the loss to Collingwood in the Grand Final three weeks later. A diminutive man at 166 cm and 61 kg, Judkins was a typical wing player of his era. At this time, teams generally used small, pacy men with good ground skills in the position. Judkins also earned praise for his handball and evasive ability; he was a hard man to tackle. Judkins missed the Tigers' 1929 finals appearance due to injury, but started the next season in blistering form, which eventually petered out. Dropped from the side five weeks before the finals, Judkins languished in the seconds, unaware he was about to make history and change the way the game would decide its best player award. In 1924, the VFL instituted the Charles Brownlow Medal, to honour a recently deceased Geelong player and official. It was decided by the umpires, who gave a single vote to the player they believed to be the best afield. In 1930 the award carried little prestige ‚Äì the winner was notified by mail and told to come and collect the award from the VFL office. Indeed, the concept of individual awards in a team game was only beginning to gain acceptance. On the Wednesday after the last game of the 1930 home and away season, the votes were tallied and Judkins was tied in first place with Harry Collier (Collingwood) and Allan Hopkins (Footscray) with a meagre tally of four votes. By comparison, the lowest previous tally to win had been six votes. Two nights after the counting, the umpires board (which administered the award) recommended that no medal be awarded as there was no provision for a tied result. However, a week later, Judkins was sitting at home when his father came in to show him a copy of a newspaper that contained an article stating Judkins had won the Brownlow Medal. Judkins was notified by the VFL to come and collect his prize and that was that. Judkins was more excited by the prospect of playing on the Saturday, when he had been recalled to the Richmond side to take on Collingwood in the semifinal. Encouraged by the award, he played a great game, but the Tigers lost a thrilling contest by three points. It transpired that the VFL administration had overruled the umpires board and created a criterion that the medal should be awarded to the player who played the fewest games. Judkins' banishment to the seconds had won him the award. It has been claimed that a vote simply labelled \\"Collier\\" was found, but as there were two Collier brothers playing in the game, the vote was not counted. To remedy the situation for the future, the rules were altered to a 3‚Äì2‚Äì1 system in 1931. The countback rule was created, providing for two players with equal votes to be separated and this system (apart from 1976‚Äì77) endured until 1981, when the countback was abolished. Finally, in 1989, retrospective medals were given out to all players who lost the award on a countback, including Hopkins and Collier. Today, Judkins remains the only Brownlow Medallist to have been dropped during the year he won the award. In addition, he is the shortest and lightest player to have won the medal, and, with the size of modern players, looks likely to remain forever so. Although a regular in a champion team, Judkins did not garner any other major individual awards during his career. From 1930 to 1935, Judkins formed one of the great centrelines in the game, teaming with centreman Eric Zschech and fellow wingman Alan Geddes. Richmond relied heavily on stability and reliability to achieve success, and being able to select the same centreline every week helped tremendously. The trio played in four consecutive Grand Finals together, winning premierships in 1932 and 1934. Judkins averaged 14 possessions in the four Grand Finals. His outstanding finals effort in this period came in the 1934 semifinal against Geelong. Judkins played a single game for Victoria and totalled ten finals for the club. He continued to catch the eye of the umpires, polling well in the 1931 and 1932 Brownlow counts when he finished equal fifth both times. At the end of 1936, when the Tigers missed the finals for the first time during his career, Judkins left VFL football at the age of 29. He had a brief stint in the country leagues of Victoria as a playing coach, notably leading the strong Albury club to the premiership in 1937. Then, he enlisted in the Second AIF and saw action in Borneo. After the war, he was central in establishing the VFL's thirds (Under 19) competition, and in 1949 he was coach of VFA club Sandringham. Judkins was given life membership at Richmond in 1962. Richmond's three other Brownlow winners were given this honour before they finished playing. He later coached Brighton Amateurs and was involved with junior clubs in the Sandringham area. His son Noel played in the Under-19s for Richmond, became an administrator with the Tigers and was later headhunted by Kevin Sheedy to oversee recruiting at Essendon. During a long career, Noel Judkins gained a reputation as one of the best talent-spotters of the modern era. Stan Judkins died in 1986.

Set in the 1920s, the film leans heavily on period detail, such as flappers, the Charleston and raccoon coats. It is named for the jazz song Has Anybody Seen My Gal? which was a hit for The California Ramblers during the '20s. Though the song is sung during the movie, its lyrics have no particular relation to the plot. Plot The year is 1928. Samuel Fulton (Charles Coburn) is an old and lonely New York millionaire who has decided to leave his fortune to the family of the late Millicent Blaisdell. Millicent is the only woman he has ever been in love with and they briefly dated, until she dumped him because she did not return his love. Samuel explains to his lawyer Edward Norton (Frank Ferguson) that losing the love of his life was what inspired him to build up a career as a wealthy businessman, eventually becoming the richest man in the world. Fearing the family will spend the money the wrong way, he decides to visit them in a small Vermont town, faking a newspaper advertisement to board a room under the alias John Smith. The family is initially reluctant to take in Samuel, but Roberta, the youngest daughter, (Gigi Perreau) wastes no time and makes him feel as welcome as possible. He notices that the Blaisdells are a happy family who, although poor, are proud of their background. Father Charles (Larry Gates) has taught the family not to put a value on materialistic products. Nevertheless, mother Harriet (Lynn Bari) wishes for her daughter Millicent (Piper Laurie) to marry Carl Pennock (Skip Homeier), a wealthy but snobbish young man who could buy Millicent everything that Harriet never had. Millicent, however, is not keen on Carl and prefers to marry Dan Stebbins (Rock Hudson), a charming but poor soda jerk. While staying at the Blaisdells, 'John' is given a job at Dan's store as soda jerk. One night, Millie and Dan announce their engagement, which upsets Harriet. Shortly after, Norton arrives, announcing the family has inherited $100,000 from an unknown man. When realizing Norton is not joking, the family ‚Äì especially Harriet ‚Äì immediately gives up their humble life for the upper-class life style. Charles is not enthusiastic of his wife's sudden craze of materialism, but allows her to buy whatever she wants. The oldest son Howard (William Reynolds) immediately starts gambling a large amount of money and lands a debt, which prompts Samuel to help him. Meanwhile, Dan, feeling he could never live up to Millie's expectations, breaks off their engagement. Afterwards, Millie reluctantly starts dating Carl again, much under the pressure of her mother. Samuel helps both Millie and Howard escape from a raid, which results in his being jailed. Soon, Harriet feels that Samuel's presence is ruining the family image, unaware of the reason why he ended up in jail. In this period, he is supported only by Dan, who admits his intentions of leaving town to build a career. Trying to prevent Millie and Dan from disappearing out of each other's life, he sets up a meeting at the cinema. There, an argument follows, and Millie exclaims her hatred for the family's sudden wealth, complaining that it is the cause of all bad things happening to her. She is comforted by Samuel, and thereby attracts the attention of other theatre-goers, who suspect that Sam and Millie were necking. During the ongoing social party at Blaisdell's house, there is gossip of the necking in the cinema, which prompts Harriet to force Millie to announce her engagement to Carl. Meanwhile, Charles announces he has lost his investments, which makes Samuel realize that the Blaisdells are in no position of making wise financial decisions. Obligated by Samuel, Norton refuses a loan, after which Charles begs the Pennocks for money. Pennock Senior (Paul McVey) refuses the loan to Charles and leaves with wife and son Carl the party, which makes clear that the engagement is off. Much to Harriet's distress, the Blaisdell family returns to their old lifestyle. At the end, Roberta reveals that 'John' has won the first prize at an art show, having secretly entered his paintings. Samuel immediately leaves the house to avoid the press, and realizes that the Blaisdells now think of him as the grandfather he could have been.

Its name reflects that its fossils were first found in modern-day Kenya. Although little is known about Kenyapotamus, its dental pattern bore similarities to that of the genus Xenohyus, a European suid from the Early Miocene. This led some scientists to conclude that hippopotami were most closely related to modern peccaries and suids.Petronio, C. (1995): Note on the taxonomy of Pleistocene hippopotamuses. Ibex 3: 53-55. PDF fulltext Recent molecular research has suggested that hippopotamuses are more closely related to cetaceans than to other artiodactyls. A morphological analysis of fossil artiodactyls and whales, which also included Kenyapotamus, strongly supported a relationship between hippos and the anatomically similar family Anthracotheriidae. Two archaic whales (Pakicetus and Artiocetus) formed the sister group of the hippopotamid-anthracotheriid clade, but this relationship was weakly supported.

If the contestant didn't win any money, the emcee opened the \\"Heart Line\\", which was a phone line to viewers who wished to donate to the contestant's family. The radio series aired on CBS from 1947 to 1950. On May 1, 1950, the show moved to NBC until December 27, 1957. Todd Russell was the host from 1947 to 1948, followed by Warren Hull. The television series premiered May 7, 1951, on CBS's daytime lineup and ran until January 3, 1958, including a prime time version from July 4, 1951, to January 12, 1955.  Premise  Strike It Rich was a game show that aired on American radio and television 1947 to 1957 on CBS and NBC. People in need of money (such as for medical treatment or a destitute family) appeared and told their tale of woe, then tried to win money by answering four relatively easy questions. Each player would be given $30 and bet any of their bankroll on answering each question after being given the category. If the contestant didn't win any money, the emcee opened the \\"Heart Line\\", a telephone hotline for viewers who wished to donate to the contestant and their family.  Original broadcast run  Sponsored by Luden's Cough Drops, the radio series aired on CBS from June 29, 1947, to April 30, 1950. Todd Russell was the host from 1947 to 1948, followed by Warren Hull. On May 1, 1950, the show moved to NBC, where it aired on weekdays, sponsored by Colgate, until December 27, 1957. The television series premiered May 7, 1951 on CBS's daytime lineup and ran until January 3, 1958. Its popularity led CBS to air a prime time version from July 4, 1951, to January 12, 1955. The nighttime version finished #25 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1951‚Äì1952 season and #21 for 1952‚Äì1953. Two attempts to revive the series were made in 1973 and 1978, although neither was successful. Another quiz show in 1986 used the same name but was otherwise unrelated.  Reception  Jane Wilson stands in for a contestant in the \\"Helping Hand\\" segment, 1952. = Controversy = While it had a simple format, the show was controversial during the 11 years it aired. Some applauded Strike It Rich for helping out some less fortunate people, as well as showcasing the sincere charity and goodwill of viewers who donated through the Heart Line. Others found it a sickening spectacle that exploited the less fortunate contestants for the vicarious thrills of the viewers and the selfish gain of the sponsors. Part of the criticism was that it promised more than it could deliver. Though the show received between 3,000 and 5,000 letters per week from needy people wishing to win what would be (to them) life-changing sums of money, only a small fraction of those could be selected. Although this was partly due to the limits of television production (the series, although ambitious in its goals, could not reasonably assist every person needing help at the same time), critics stated that the show picked mostly those thought to have the most interesting tales of woe.  Complaints  Hull (left) with contestants from Pittsburgh and Atkinson (right). Despite warnings by the show's producers, a number of people hoping to be contestants exhausted their money to travel to New York, only to be rejected and end up relying on charities such as the Salvation Army to help them return home. This led to a large number of complaints from charities and local government agencies: * The New York City commissioner of welfare called Strike It Rich \\"a disgusting spectacle and a national disgrace.\\" The welfare commissioner brought the show to court on charges of unlicensed fund-raising and actually won a conviction. * The supervisor of the Travelers Aid Society said, \\"Putting human misery on display can hardly be called right.\\" * The general director of the Family Service Association of America said flatly, \\"Victims of poverty, illness, and everyday misfortune should not be made a public spectacle or seemingly to be put in the position of begging for charity.\\" * The New York legislature looked into the controversy, but later dropped it, claiming it \\"lacked jurisdiction.\\" * TV Guide called it \\"a despicable travesty on the very nature of charity.\\"  Networks' response  CBS and NBC remained unconcerned over the charity controversy, stating: \\"We don't want to do anything that would antagonize the sponsor.\\" Statements such as this allowed companies such as Geritol and Revlon to continue to control all aspects of the shows they sponsored. Strike It Rich last aired on CBS daytime in its 11:30 am time slot on Friday, January 3, 1958. It was replaced on Monday, January 6 by game show newcomer Dotto. Dotto would go on to become the highest rated daytime show of the 1950s until its cancellation seven months later, the first casualty of the 1950s quiz show scandals. = Revival = Two attempts to revive the series were made in 1973 and 1978, although neither was successful. Another quiz show in 1986 used the same name but was otherwise unrelated.  Merchandise  A board game of Strike it Rich featuring host Warren Hull on the cover was released by Lowell Toy Mfg. in 1956.  Episode status  Recordings of the series were destroyed, partly owing to network standards of the era and partly owing to its controversial nature. Four episodes are held at the UCLA Film and Television Archive, and a few are held by the Paley Center for Media. The J. Fred & Leslie W.

It breeds in much of Sub-Saharan Africa. It is a species of open ground, including agricultural land, grassland, flood- plains and burnt fynbos. It is resident, but some inland populations move to lower altitudes in winter. The common names for this species refer to the English explorer, Major Dixon Denham, and the English naturalist Edward Smith- Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby. Description left Denham's bustard is the largest species in the genus Neotis, although is smaller than the bustards in the genus Ardeotis (as well as the great bustard). The male is and , the female is much smaller at and .Stanley‚Äôs bustard (Neotis denhami) . arkive.orgLiebenberg, Louis (1990), Field Guide to the Animal Tracks of Southern Africa. David Philip, Publishers, The back is brown, darker and plainer in the male, and the underparts are white. The neck is pale grey with an orange nape. Its grey crown is bordered with black, and a black line runs through the eye with a white line forming an eyebrow above. The long legs are pale yellow. The wings are strikingly patterned in brown, white and black, the male showing more white in flight than the female or young birds. The long legs are yellowish in color and the bill is whitish horn in color. The male inflates his throat when displaying to show a conspicuous balloon of white feathers. This species is usually silent. Distribution and habitat There are three subspecies of this bustard, all separated in their distribution. N. d. denhami occurs in southwestern Mauritania, Senegal and Gambia then eastwards to Uganda and Ethiopia. N. d. jacksoni is found in Kenya and Tanzania and south to Zambia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, with populations also in Angola, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. N. d. stanleyi occurs in South Africa and Swaziland. The Denham's bustard occupies grassland habitats. Mainly they are distributed in savanna and may be found at any elevation up to . They can be found in a considerable range of secondary habitats including dense shrubland, light woodland, farmland, dried marsh and arid plains. Behavior Denham's bustard are often solitary outside of the mating season, although they congregate at large food sources and temporarily band together for migratory movements. Migration is usually in search of food sources and follows passages of rain. This species is omnivorous, feeding on a wide variety of foods as it becomes available to them. Among the diverse foods recorded in the species are insects, small snakes, rodents, the nestlings of other birds and various green plant life. They will sometimes follow ungulate species in order to pick dung beetles out of their droppings. Like all bustards, the male Denham's bustard performs a courtship display to attract the attention on females, on what is called a lek. During his display, the male puffs up his head and chest and flairs his tail, thus appearing larger, and calls loudly while he struts about. Breeding occurs over varied times of the year, being especially undefined in East Africa. Breeding may brought on by presence of rainfall. The nest consists of a shallow scrape, in which the female lays one or two eggs, which (if they survive) she will raise alone.Alden, P.C., Estes, R.D., Schlitter, D. and McBride, B. (1996) Collins Guide to African Wildlife. HarperCollins Publishers, London . Status It has suffered population declines through much, if not all, of its range. Countries including South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria have had a sharp decrease in population. Hunting is the primary cause of declines across the Sahel and West Africa, but in eastern and southern Africa, conversion of grassland to agriculture is a greater threat. In some areas, the conversion of grassland into commercially logged forest has been threat for the species.Denham's Bustard (Neotis denhami) ‚Äì BirdLife species factsheet. Birdlife.org.

The film is based on his novel inspired by his experiences. Plot The Homesteader involves six principal characters, the leading one being Jean Baptiste (Charles Lucas), a homesteader far off in the Dakotas, the lone African American living in the area. To this wilderness arrives Jack Stewart, a Scotsman, with his motherless daughter, Agnes (Iris Hall), who doesn't know that she is biracial. In Agnes, Baptiste meets the girl of his dreams. Peculiar fate threw her in the company of the Homesteader, but, because Baptiste is black and Agnes is presumably white, their love is forbidden by law. Baptiste eventually sacrifices the love of this girl of his dreams, goes back to his own people and marries Orlean, the daughter of a black preacher named McCarthy. McCarthy, the embodiment of vanity, deceit and hypocrisy, really admires the marriage his daughter has made. He speaks of the \\"rich\\" young man she has married, praises him to the highest. Baptiste does not know, however, that McCarthy requires and is in the habit of having people praise him. Baptiste does not do it because he is not of the temperament to do so. Because of this failure grows the tragedy of mismarriage to Orlean (Evelyn Preer), a sweet girl, kind and good, but like her mother, without the strength of her convictions. Baptiste, Orlean having failed him, is persecuted by McCarthy and by Ethel (McCarthy's other daughter), who, like her father, possesses all the evil a woman is capable of; she is married to weak-kneed Glavis. In the end, Orlean, driven insane by the evil she had been the innocent cause of, rights a wrong which causes Baptiste to go back to his land in the Dakotas, where he finds the girl he first discovered. Later, he learns the truth about her race and the story has a beautiful ending.Sampson, Henry T.

It is believed to be the first feature-length film made with a black cast and crew, for a black audience, and thus the first example of a race movie. Most of the filming, if not all, took place in Winner, South Dakota.

Jackson Square. The Great New Orleans Fire (1794) was a fire that destroyed 212 structures in New Orleans, Louisiana on December 8, 1794, in the area now known as the French Quarter from Burgundy to Chartres Street, almost to the riverfront buildings. Another 856 buildings had been destroyed 6 years earlier, in the First Great New Orleans Fire on March 21, 1788.  History  The fire started on December 8, 1794. The fire area stretched across 212 buildings, including the royal jail. It spared the Mississippi River front buildings. Among the buildings spared were the Customs House, the tobacco warehouses, the Governor's Building, the Royal Hospital, and the Ursulines Convent. Despite widespread fire damage, the St. Louis Cathedral was not destroyed but was dedicated just 2 weeks later, on December 23, 1794. Afterward, the schooner Nuestra Se√±ora del C√°rmen was used as a temporary jail during the period December 10, 1794 to February 26, 1795. The ship's owner, Don Prospero Ferrayolo, received rental payments for use of the ship, replacing the royal jail destroyed during the fire. The Spanish were to replace the wooden buildings with structures with courtyards, thick brick walls, arcades, and wrought iron balconies. Among the new buildings were the signature New Orleans buildings of St. Louis Cathedral (1794), the Cabildo (1799), and the Presbytere (1797), all designed by Gilberto Guillemard. In 1795, Don Andr√©s Almonaster y Rojas had agreed to pay for construction of the building now known as the Cabildo. It replaced an earlier structure that had been destroyed by the fire. Almonester had already commissioned Gilberto Guillemard to design the new cathedral and Presbytere. Just 6 years earlier, on March 21, 1788, another 856 buildings had been destroyed in the Great New Orleans Fire (1788). Still a colony of Spain, rebuilding after both fires continued in Spanish style, and most French architecture was eliminated from the French Quarter.

She also co-authored a trilogy of historical novels about Black Mormon pioneers titled Standing on the Promises with Darius Gray. The trilogy, published between 2000 and 2003, was republished in revised and expanded form in 2012 and 2013. Young scripted and helped direct a 2005 television documentary based on the life of Jane Elizabeth Manning James, \\"Jane Manning James: Your Sister in the Gospel.\\" The 20-minute documentary has been shown at This Is The Place Heritage Park in Salt Lake City, Utah, the 2005 annual conference of the Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research (FAIR), and on public television (PBS). Documentary filmmaker Scott Freebairn produced and directed the film. More recently, Young served as the project director for the Utah chapter of the Afro-American Historical and Genealogical Society's film The Wisdom of our Years. In 2008, Young and Gray completed a long documentary titled Nobody Knows: The Untold Story of Black Mormons, which has been shown on PBS stations, in film festivals, and on the Documentary Channel.

The street, formerly three separate thoroughfares, extends from Pacific Street in the city's east, to Selma Street in and since 2008 has been the focus of community-led creative enterprises and projects. Established as the city's main street for commercial and retail activity, Hunter Street entered a period of severe decline after World War II. Since 2008, the eastern end of Hunter Street has emerged as a precinct for niche retail and the night-time economy. In June 2012 it was announced that the pedestrian mall between Perkins and Newcomen Streets will be redeveloped by the public and private sectors to stimulate the city's ongoing revitalisation. History Hunter Street runs in the vicinity of an early nineteenth-century track known as Wellington Street that extended from Watt Street (formerly George Street) in the east to Perkins Street in the west. The strip was renamed Hunter Street by Henry Dangar in 1823 and by the mid nineteenth-century commercial and residential properties had been built on most addresses east of Perkins Street. Recalling the town in 1866, Mr. Thomas Brown described Hunter Street as \\"unpaved, grass grown and deserted\\". West of Perkins Street, the Australian Agricultural Company owned a separate track that ran to what is today Bank Corner. From here, in the vicinity of the existing Bellevue Street, another track called Charlton Street continued west to Dairy Farmer's Corner (Tudor Street) and out to the Islington Bridge. By century's end, Blane and Charlton Streets had been renamed Hunter Street West and today these three streets are considered to be one. Workmen laying concrete paving, Hunter Street, ca. 1921, Sam Hood By 1900, Hunter Street stretched from its original eastern terminus to Dairy Farmer's Corner. In this year, 26 hotels were operating along the street with the majority of buildings concentrated east of the intersection with Darby Street. Development gained momentum after the introduction of steam trams in 1887 and the first restrictions on vehicular traffic drawn by animals was introduced in 1898. Drainage problems and raw sewerage necessitated the sealing of Hunter Street, first carried out with wooden blocks, concrete and asphalt, and the street was extended east to Telford Street in the early years of last century. Following the opening of steelworks in Mayfield during 1915, Newcastle became increasingly suburban and Hunter Street developed as a destination for commerce and retail. The size and extravagance of Newcastle's early twentieth-century department stores demonstrates the popularity of city shopping. Scotts Limited and W. Winn & Co. Pty Ltd erected landmark stores near the original confluence of Hunter and Blane Streets, creating the eastern bookend of a retail strip that by mid-century stretched to the Newcastle and Suburban Co-operative Society (better known as \\"The Store\\") near Dairy Farmer's Corner. As well as department stores, picture palaces also began to punctuate Hunter Street in the years leading up to World War II. Entertainment was concentrated in two precincts, one around the Palais Royale and Theatre Royal (Steel to Bellevue Streets), and the other from Perkins Street to the former Strand Theatre at the intersection with Market Street. The electrification of the city's tram network delivered thousands of people into the city on any given Friday and Saturday nights, creating greater connectivity with suburbs in the city's west and south. In the decade that followed World War II, the rapid suburbanisation of Newcastle created unprecedented competition for traditional retail areas. The opening of shopping centres in , and , triggered a steady migration away from Hunter Street despite the completion of a pedestrian mall between Perkins and Newcomen Streets in the 1970s. Construction in the city centre stagnated during this period of decentralisation, expedited by a destructive earthquake in 1989. After the earthquake Hunter Street remained inaccessible for two weeks. A recession in the early 1990s, coupled with record youth unemployment, brought the emptying of Hunter Street to a nadir in 2008. In this year, with the vacancy rate at 20% and chronically vacant properties beginning to deteriorate, Marcus Westbury created the Renew Newcastle initiative to activate empty shop fronts in and around the Hunter Street Mall. Since 2008, the Renew model has activated over 100 properties in the city centre and many of these projects have addressed Hunter Street. In recent years, independent art galleries and niche retail has flourished in Hunter Street. The Newcastle Art School, a campus of Hunter Institute of TAFE established in the 1890s is also located in Hunter Street. East of Auckland Street, near City Hall, independent coffee shops, restaurants and small bars have been appearing along the streetscape since 2009. According to The Newcastle Herald in July 2013, the Hunter Street vacancy rate is less than half that of 2008 and business confidence has improved in precincts east of City Hall. In June 2012, NSW State Government's land and property developer, Landcom, purchased two thirds of The GPT Groups Newcastle city centre landholdings for $20 million and plan to develop four city blocks into a combination of residential, commercial and retail space.

She is under the impression that she is there on his invitation; he says not but nevertheless allows her entry. He is civil, formal, his conversation phatic.

She has come, she informs him, to listen but then asks if she can \\"see them\\". He says not but he does permit her to operate the two knobs that control the music and the words she has come to hear. \\"[I]s it live?\\" she wants to know. He doesn't answer other than to instruct her how to control the sounds: \\"[You] must twist ‚Ä¶ To the right.\\"Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 108 His subsequent answers indicate there are individuals behind the sounds, one producing words, the other music. Each is alone, isolated from the other and required to produce their respective sound continually without respite. The man says he can't however describe their conditions for her. Both sounds are faint and \\"not together\\". The woman wants them louder but the volume never varies while she is there. Having heard as much as she needs she wants to know if Macgillycuddy likes what he hears. For once he opens up and confesses that \\"[i]t has become a need\\"Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 109 but admits nothing more. She readies to go, leaving him to his \\"needs\\" (a rather sardonic remark which he fails to counter). Before she exits, she asks a strange question: \\"Is that a Turkoman?\\" Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 109 Predictably the man ignores the question and goes to show her out. She takes a wrong turn and nearly walks into where they keep the \\"house garbage\\" implying that there are other locations that produce waste. After she has left there is a long pause. The audience then hears the sound of two curtains being drawn evocative of those around a hospital bed. The man picks up the telephone receiver and dials. We only hear his side of the following phone conversations. He asks the young lady who answers the phone ‚Äì he refers to her as \\"Miss\\" ‚Äì to have the doctor call him back. He says that it's urgent and waits impatiently for the phone to ring. It is hard to believe this is the same man who was so proper with his woman visitor only a few lines earlier. Could this be a different point in time completely? Or were the curtains available all the time but were only closed while he attended to his unwelcome visitor? He gets a return call but it's only to inform him that they cannot locate the doctor. She rings off and he curses her: \\"Slut!\\"Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 111 His agitation builds. He's beginning to panic. The phone rings a second time. This time it may be the doctor who asks a number of pertinent questions to which the answers are, \\"they‚Äôre ending\\", \\"this morning\\", \\"she‚Äôs left me\\", \\"they‚Äôre together\\" and \\"how could they meet?\\"Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), pp 110,111 The voice on the end of the phone tries to reassure him that \\"last ‚Ä¶ gasps\\" are all alike and then rings off telling him he'll receive a visit in an hour. Macgillycuddy slams the phone down and curses again. This time he uses the word \\"Swine!\\" suggestive of the fact that he has been talking to a different person, most likely a male. A few moments later the phone rings one final time. He's now told not to expect the doctor before noon the next day; he has two births (first gasps?) to attend to, one of which is breech. Music and Voice are then heard \\"[t]ogether, ending, breaking off together, resuming together more and more feebly\\" and then there is nothing. After a long pause the man whispers, \\"Tomorrow ‚Ä¶ noon ‚Ä¶\\" Interpretation Critics tend to avoid or at best gloss over this short piece. \\"Beckett's play is a sort of quartet, a dialogue between a man, 'he', and a woman, 'she', interspersed by 'Music' and 'Voice'. 'Music' and 'Voice' are, we are led to believe, going on all the time; 'he' has two buttons, which allow him to listen in to them. Within the Beckett canon Rough for Radio I is usually thought of as a preliminary exploration of the possibilities of radio, which would be explored more fully in Cascando and Words and Music.‚Äù Barry McGovern confirms that Beckett requested that \\"[t]he first Rough for Radio [was] not for production, the author feeling that Cascando had overtaken it, so to speak.\\"McGovern, B., 'Beckett and the Radio Voice' in Murray, C., (Ed.) Samuel Beckett ‚Äì 100 Years (Dublin: New Island, 2006), p 132 In Rough for Radio I, the voice and the music are switched on and off as if they are being broadcast simultaneously on two separate radio stations. The same idea is presented in Cascando, but there the voice and the music do not seem to derive from an external source. Very much as the sound of the sea is in Embers, in Radio I, as it is sometimes called, \\"[m]usic is not, as usual, merely functional (for instance, as intermezzo, background music or even worse, quite simply a creator of atmosphere), but [‚Ä¶] is allotted an intrinsic role.\\"Rijnvos, R., 'Samuel Beckett Today, What is it like together? Genesis of the First Production of Beckett‚Äôs Radio I ' in Buning, M. and Oppenheim, L., (Eds.) Beckett in the 1990s, Selected papers from the Second International Symposium held in The Hague, 8 ‚Äì 12 April 1992 (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1993), p 103 But it is not simply a matter of turning a radio on and off. Voice and Music are characters in their own right. They occupy identical physical locations and conditions away from the \\"elicitor\\", as Merle T√∂nnies refers to him, and are apparently unaware of each other's existence. Macgillycuddy acts as a master figure [who] \\"extorts words or sounds from his servants or victims, over whom he appears to have absolute control.\\"T√∂nnies, M., 'Players, Playthings And Patterns: Three Stages of Heteronomy in Beckett‚Äôs Mature Drama' in Moorjani, A. and Veit, C., (Eds.) Samuel Beckett Today/Aujourd'hui, Samuel Beckett: Endlessness in the Year 2000 (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2001) Only he doesn't. Like the living statue in Catastrophe Voice and Music are capable of rebellion, even if that rebellion is simply to die and thus upset the status quo. As the play moves on it becomes clear that they are slipping out of his control. In many ways it is \\"obvious that the master is as dependent on his servants as they are on him.\\" Rather than the doctor being needed to attend to the ailing Voice and Music, Barry McGovern has put forward the thought that it is the man himself who is seeking medical attention and draws a parallel with the Bolton and Holloway story in Embers. It has also been suggested that the knobs access a kind of sonar, which could allow the visitor to monitor the two babies that are waiting to be born. There could be a personal connection too. He says everyone has left him. This might include a pregnant wife. The fact that Voice and Music occupy two identical spaces could represent wombs but there is too little to work with here to be sure. Works inspired by Radio I is a realisation of Rough for Radio I, which the Dutch composer Richard Rijnvos made for Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (NOS) in 1991. Michael Gough played 'He' and Joan Plowright, 'She'. The composer John Cage was the voice with music by the Ives Ensemble. In Raymond Gervais's 2006 work Je suis venue pour √©couter (I Have Come to Listen), extracts from Esquisse radiophonique as well as from his own translation of Rough for Radio II appear on the cover of CD cases grouped together on the wall. Displayed in total darkness, the installation can only be discovered partially, with the use of a flashlight.

She is best remembered for taking charge of and continuing an expedition in the Congo and Uganda at the age of 24, when her father was killed by a lion.  Early life  Vivienne de Watteville was the only child of the Swiss-French naturalist and artist Bernard Perceval de Watteville (Bernhard Perceval von Wattenwyl, 1877‚Äì1924) and his English wife Florence Emily Beddoes (1876‚Äì1909). Her father had been a pupil of the painter Hubert von Herkomer before turning naturalist. Her mother died of cancer when she was nine, and she spent her childhood holidays from her English boarding-school (St. George's School, Ascot) tomboyishly alone with her father, whom she called 'Brovie' ['brother'], in remote parts of Norway and in the Alps. (He called her 'Murray, my son'.) She had wanted to go to Oxford University and earn her own living, but her father, possessive to a fault,de Watteville, Seeds that the Wind may bring (London, 1965), p.58 had brushed aside both ideas.de Watteville, Seeds that the Wind may bring (London, 1965), p.171  Out in the Blue (1927)  Natural History Museum of Bern: lesser kudu collected by Bernard de Watteville on the Uaso Nyiro in northern Kenya, November 1923 In 1923 Vivienne and her father set off on an eighteen-month safari through Kenya, Uganda and the Belgian Congo. It was primarily a hunt for big game, collecting fauna for mounting in the Natural History Museum of Bern, Switzerland, without the help of a professional hunter. In her first book, Out in the Blue (i.e. in the far country), published in 1927, she describes her experiences on safari. The de Wattevilles had been troubled by marauding lions through much of their trip. Lions had attacked the mules in the boma (camp enclosure) and Bernard had shot several of the big cats. One, on the verge of starvation, had stormed their camp and raced off with a canvas bathtub, which it had tried to eat. Sometime later they found nails and torn bits of canvas in its droppings.Seerey-Lester, John. July 2010. Legends of the Hunt. (They found the remains of their missing Airedale inside a leopard.) At the start of the safari, Bernard de Watteville had missed most of what he shot at; by the time he and his daughter reached the Congo, he had bagged more than a hundred trophies. At that time elephant hunting was permitted. Their collection included the Big Five (elephant, lion, leopard, cape buffalo, and rhino). They also shot giraffe, over thirty types of antelope, and even a male mountain bongo, which took seven weeks of stalking in the Aberdare Range. With the help of Echuya Batwa (Pygmy) trackers, they approached gorillas in the Virunga Mountains but were unable to shoot one. They also wanted a northern white rhinoceros and had obtained special permission from the Ugandan authorities to shoot the animal. The young and enterprising Vivienne, though only 23 years old, handled all the taxidermy, working to preserve whatever her father shot for the museum. She was, in addition, the camp nurse, relying heavily on Epsom salts and quinine powder, her cure-all remedies. :\\"My father went down with jaundice and I was crippled by veld sores (Africa's worst kind of boil). How I dreaded the wet branches that sprang back like a whip-lash against my festering shins. We all of us had septic throats, and the porters and cook went down with fever.\\"de Watteville, The Listener magazine, 24 April 1941, p.596 Natural History Museum of Bern: northern white rhinoceros collected by Vivienne de Watteville in north-west Uganda, December 1924 (photo Beat Estermann) On 30 September 1924,de Watteville, Out in the Blue (London, 1927), p.248 on the Congolese shore of Lake Edward, shortly after being refused permission by the Belgian authorities to hunt the rare okapi, Bernard shot and wounded a lion, his nineteenth. Believing that no wounded animal should be abandoned (he had often pursued wounded buffalo in thick cover),de Watteville, Out in the Blue (London, 1927), p.218 he followed the lion on foot into a bed of reeds where it lunged at him and swatted him to the ground. He jumped to his feet and fired at the retreating animal, causing it to whirl around and in just a few bounds attack him once again. The angry cat mauled him until he was able to shoot it while it was on top of him. The lion's claws were buried in the man's body and had to be pulled out one by one. Two hours later Bernard staggered into camp where he collapsed in his daughter's tent. Vivienne did her best to save her father, treating his infected wounds with raw crystals of permanganate, but the bleeding could not be stopped. Bernard died at sundown the next day and was buried the day after. Though suffering from spirillum fever and shock, and though before her father's death she had killed nothing bigger than dik-dik and guinea fowl, Vivienne took charge of the safari and completed the mission, shooting both for the pot (she had a team of native trackers, skinners and porters to feed) and for the collection. One of the remaining species on their license that she successfully hunted was a northern white rhinoceros.Photograph of Vivienne de Watteville with white rhino, Dec. 1924 flickr.com Vivienne returned to Europe in 1925 to write her book. Among admirers of Out in the Blue was Wilfred Thesiger, who was greatly impressed and moved by it.Maitland, Alexander, Wilfred Thesiger in Africa (London, 2010) Despite the killing, the book is notable for its sensitive description of animals and landscape and for its note of regret. \\"To have been granted even one [bongo] cow was a great concession, for they are strictly preserved; to have slain two seemed to us nothing less than calamity.\\"de Watteville, Out in the Blue (London, 1927), p.156 The de Watteville specimens, mounted, were exhibited from 1936 in the dioramas of the new Mus√©e d'histoire naturelle at Bern.Wattenwyl, Bernhard Perceval von, www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F44364.php  Speak to the Earth (1935)  =Part I= In 1928‚Äì29 Vivienne returned to Kenya for seven months, officially to photograph and film elephants, but on a personal level to seek solitude Thoreau-style and fulfil a personal dream of going into the wilds unarmed and \\"in some unforeseen way to win the friendship of the beasts.\\" \\"Now I was going back in my own way,\\" she noted pointedly.de Watteville, Speak to the Earth (London, 1935), p.5 After overcoming official resistance ‚Äì she was by then a minor celebrity in the Colony and, an aristocratic beauty,Photograph of Vivienne de Watteville and Siki in the Maasai Reserve, 1928: flickr.com: Photograph of Vivienne de Watteville and Siki under Coryndon Peak, Mount Kenya, 1929: Ramblings of a Deltiologist in demand socially ‚Äì she spent five months camping in the Maasai Game Reserve on the border with Tanganyika, alone but for five porters from the 1923-4 expedition, her Irish terrier Siki, her books, gramophone and collection of classical records, and an armed askari (the colonial officials were taking no chances). \\"Around me the plains ran out to the far mountains melting into the night, and above all, like an invisible presence, Kilimanjaro drew a faint gleam of snow under the first stars.\\" Despite bouts of malaria she mostly achieved her aims: she was tolerated by the elephants, and her chosen camp- site near Namanga turned out to be rhino grazing-ground, with the rhinos returning to graze around the tents. She narrowly escaped death in a close encounter with a lion (thinking the visitor one night was a hyaena, she left her tent to chase it off, realising her mistake too late to retreat: she was so close to the lion she could have touched it), and twice with charging rhinos that missed her by inches; she climbed two mountains (Ol Doinyo Orok and Longido); and she killed no animals except, at the request of the local Maasai, a man-eating lioness, shot by her askari. Nithi Falls near Urumandi, Mount Kenya =Part II= She then spent an idyllic two months (January‚ÄìFebruary 1929) based in Urumandi Hut on Mount Kenya (see Mountaineering on Mount Kenya), in the giant heather and parkland zone, some of the time with two porters and some alone, exploring the mountain and valleys, bathing naked in the rock-pools below the Nithi Falls, befriending the birds and small animals, collecting flowers and seeds, sketching the flora, and meditating \\"first principles\\".de Watteville, Speak to the Earth (London, 1935), p.319 While up at the peaks she witnessed the third ascent of Mount Kenya, by Eric Shipton, Percy Wyn-Harris and Gustav Sommerfelt (January 1929), who next day took her on a scramble around the south-face glaciers. She thanked them on their return to Urumandi Hut with perfectly mixed cocktails. In her last weeks on the mountain she and the porters saved the alpine hut from a forest fire after a day-long struggle. Suffering toothache a few days later, rather than cut short her stay and return to Nairobi, Vivienne pulled out the tooth herself in an operation that took three hours and forty minutes, using first fishing-wire and gravity, then pliers from her tool kit. This second journey to Africa resulted in her book Speak to the Earth: Wanderings among Elephants and Mountains, published in 1935. It contains a Preface by Edith Wharton, who admired Out in the Blue and who asked Vivienne to write another book about Africa not centred on hunting. Its epigraph, \\"Speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee\\" [Job 12,8] points to the book's gentle didacticism, touching as it does on existential questions relating to the human spirit, self-knowledge, solitude, risk-taking, Nature and happiness. \\"In the Conradian undertones,\\" writes B√©atrice Bijon (2009),B√©atrice Bijon, In- Between Two Worlds: Narratives by Female Explorers and Travellers, 1850‚Äì1945 (New York, 2009), p.178 \\"her narrative proves to be an exploration of the self.\\" Shortly after the book's publication, the unnamed 80 m. waterfalls below Lake Michaelson high up the Gorges Valley on Mount Kenya were called the 'Vivienne Falls' in the author's honour.Photograph of the Vivienne Falls, Gorges Valley, Mt Kenya: flickr.com: =Publishing history= Among English reprints of Speak to the Earth was a Penguin edition (1988) with an introduction by Alexander Maitland, biographer of Wilfred Thesiger. A French edition appeared in 1936 as L'appel de l'Afrique, the two parts of which have since been republished separately as Un th√© chez les √©l√©phants and Petite musique de chambre sur le mont Kenya (1997). Part 1 has recently been translated into Italian as Sulle orme degli elefanti (2013) (:'On the trail of the elephants').  Seeds that the Wind may bring (1965)  Ile de Port-Cros, where Vivienne and Bunt play hide-and-seek during their courtship. Travelling in the South of France in June 1929, as she tells us in her third and final book, Vivienne chances to visit with her Swiss grandmother, Blanche Eleonore de Gingins (an unfailing supporter of her adventurous approach to life), the Ile de Port-Cros, one of the √éles d'Hy√®res on the C√¥te d'Azur. Enchanted by the unspoilt island, she conceives the idea of settling in a remote g√Æte there and making it \\"a rest-home for world-weary friends\\". She rents a house in the bay of Port Man, orders alterations and, shopping recklessly in Paris in August (she has now come into a legacy), furnishes it to perfection. Things at first go to plan, though she is cheated and brow- beaten by all around her (\\"Bleak is the battle of the lone woman in Latin countries,\\" she notes). She observes, detached, the failing relationships of her guests. But her idyll turns to nightmare when alone during the wind- tormented winter months, she finds to her horror that her only servant, a full-blooded young Italian called Josef, has developed a passion for her. Josef is driven to frenzies of jealousy by the visits of a cultivated Englishman, Bunt; and in a dramatic climax reminiscent of a D. H. Lawrence plot, though with an un-Lawrentian outcome, Vivienne, \\"like one waking from the dead\\", is forced to confront her psychological demons: her \\"freedom- complex\\" (\\"it was my own will to be free that had bound me hand and foot\\" ... \\"the battle within raged between this devil's pride and the other voice which pleaded for the self's surrender\\"de Watteville, Seeds that the Wind may bring (London, 1965), p.111); the ambivalent ties that bind her to her father's memory; delayed trauma from her father's death; fear of \\"saddling [herself] with the wrong companion for the rest of [her] life\\"; extreme perfectionism.Josef was the \\"Giuseppe\\" assigned to D. H. and Frieda Lawrence as manservant on their visit to Port-Cros in October 1928, a few months before Vivienne's arrival [Collected Letters of D. H. Lawrence, ed. Harry T. Moore (London 1962), p.1095] In the book that she wrote about this Port-Cros adventure, Seeds that the Wind may bring (published posthumously in 1965), we find a travel-writer confronting with honest self-examination the question 'What am I doing here?'. Vivienne's third book thus becomes an ironic and mature comment on her second, which itself was a comment on her first. It is also, in its latter pages, a love-story, about \\"the heaven-sent gift of two people of perfect understanding\\". Bunt (Capt. George Gerard Goschen, soldier, diplomat), a stranger she had met at an Albert Hall concert and who visits her on the island, shares her love of solitude and beauty, music and games, helps save her from the unhappy Josef, and at the end becomes her fianc√©.  Later life  On 23 July 1930 Vivienne de Watteville married Captain George Gerard Goschen (1887‚Äì1953)George Gerard Goschen, The Peerage, thepeerage.com/p47301.htm#i473009 and they moved to Hopesay, Shropshire, then King's Farm, Binsted, Hampshire. They had two children, David Bernard (born 1931), and Tana (born 1932), named after the river Tana in Kenya. \\"Nothing short of bearing and rearing children myself,\\" de Watteville wrote, \\"coming down with humility into the struggling world, could have taught me the greatness of women.\\"de Watteville, Seeds that the Wind may bring (London, 1965), p.61 After her marriage she gave talks on the BBC wireless and published articles. Among her friends was Karen Blixen, who described her as a witty conversationalist.Perrin, Jim, Shipton and Tilman (London, 2013), p.115 (Denys Finch Hatton had advised Vivienne on her 1928 itinerary.) When the success of Speak to the Earth called for a new edition of Out in the Blue in 1937, she considered, as she notes in the Preface, rewriting her first book to play down the hunting scenes, given changing attitudes to big-game hunting in the 1930s, and to bring the book into line with her own maturer outlook; but she resisted the temptation in the interests of historical truth. Vivienne Goschen died in hospital on 27 June 1957, of cancer. \\"When told that she had no more than a fortnight to live,\\" J. Alan White wrote,de Watteville, Seeds that the Wind may bring (London, 1965), Preface \\"she received the news with relief, and even a kind of exaltation, that the pain and uncertainty from which she had suffered for a number of years were about to end. She saw no reason for deep grief; she was 56 and had had a satisfying life. The few pain- free hours in the last two weeks of her life were devoted to the clearing up of her affairs.\\" She left her eyes to the Eye Bank, and the manuscript of her third book to a friend, J. Alan White, asking him to oversee its publication. Vivienne and George Goschen were buried at Hopesay, Shropshire, which had been the home of her English grandfather, Capt. H. W. Beddoes, R.N.  Influence  Among writers influenced by de Watteville's two African books was Ernest Hemingway, who originally included a quotation from Speak to the Earth as an epigraph to his 1936 story 'The Snows of Kilimanjaro'.Lewis, Robert W., 'Vivienne de Watteville, Hemingway's Companion on Kilimanjaro', Texas Quarterly 9 (Winter 1966), pp.75‚Äì85; Stephens, Robert O., 'Hemingway's Riddle of Kilimanjaro: Idea and Image', American Literature, 22 March 1960, pp.84‚Äì87; Waldhorn, Arthur, A Reader's Guide to Ernest Hemingway (New York, 1972); Titner, Adeline R., 'Wharton's Forgotten Preface to Vivienne de Watteville's Speak to the Earth: A Link with Hemingway's 'The Snows of Kilimanjaro' ', Notes on Modern American Literature 8, no.2 (Autumn 1984), item 10 Part I of Speak to the Earth ends, like 'Snows', with a vision of Kilimanjaro after rain, and with a sense of its sunlit snows as the next destination.

The term originates from the Securities Act of 1933 and NASD Rule 2810, which addresses the regulation of compensation, fees and expenses in public offerings of DPPs. Direct participation programs are most commonly formed to invest in real estate, energy, futures & options, and equipment leasing projects. A DPP is typically organized as a limited partnership or limited liability company, structures that enable the income and losses of the entity to flow-through to the underlying taxpayer on a pre-tax basis. As such, the DPP pays no tax at the corporate level. An investor's stake in the DPP is quantified in units and may be referred to as their interest. A non-listed real estate investment trust enjoys a special tax-free status if its distribution of income is sufficient, and as such may be organized as a corporation without being subject to double taxation. The Investment Program Association (www.ipa.com) is the U.S. trade association dedicated to the advancement of the asset class and the Real Estate Investment Association (www.reisa.org) provides education, networking and advocacy for members. DPPs typically use a much wider, intermediary-dominated distribution network than other alternative investment funds. Broker/dealers have alternative investment platforms that include these funds and are paid commissions for their role in distribution and servicing. The compliance and operational aspects of sponsoring these funds are more complicated due to the involvement of retail investors and the payment of trailing commissions. DPP Transfer Agents provide outsourcing services to support IT and administrative functions. DPP securities are generally not traded publicly, so the value of a DPP product is determined by the performance of the underlying assets rather than by the public markets. DPP products are generally illiquid for their duration, although some limited secondary markets may exist.

It is immediately adjacent to its twin town of Forster, which is the larger of the two towns. At the , the Forster-Tuncurry area had a population of 19,918 people. This number grows considerably in the tourist season. The population of Tuncurry alone was 6,186. History In 1875, John Wright was the first white settler in Tuncurry.North Coast Run: Men and Ships of the New South Wales North Coast M. Richards P94 - 95 The first land grant in this area was in 1875. The settlement was originally called North Shore and then North Forster and was renamed Tuncurry meaning \\"plenty of fish\\" in 1891 and then proclaimed a village in 1893. The area was well known in the early days for its timber cutting and sawmills. Timber was collected from the lakes and rivers by the logpunts (droghers). A bridge over the Coolongolook River that marks the entrance to Wallis Lake was built in 1959 linking Forster and Tuncurry and replacing the punt service that had operated since 1890.  Tourism  Because of its close driving proximity to Sydney, Forster-Tuncurry has established itself as a popular summer holiday destination, where in the hotter months, the population swells considerably. The school holidays in the colder months also bring large numbers of holidaymakers. Tuncurry's Nine Mile Beach is a popular swimming, surfing and fishing spot. Tuncurry Rockpool is a shark netted swimming enclosure, formed by breakwalls which mark the entrance to Wallis Lake. Tuncurry's lakefront areas are characterised by wharves and jetties which provide mooring for fishing boats and pleasure craft. The region's local cinema, Great Lakes Cinema 3, is based on the Tuncurry side of the bridge.

It is currently under construction.www.thuthiem.hochiminhcity.gov.vn Many local residents protest against relocations. Location Th·ªß Thi√™m is situated on a point bar of the Saigon River in the municipal division known as District 2. On the opposite bank of the river are District 1‚ÄîHo Chi Minh City's central business district‚ÄîDistrict 7, and the B√¨nh Th·∫°nh District. It also borders District 9 of the city. History Before its clearance for redevelopment, Th·ªß Thi√™m was one of the most densely settled areas of Ho Chi Minh City and included a central market established in 1751. Beginning in 2002 and continuing for almost a decade, between 14-15,000 households were removed from the development site and resettled. Master planning for the site began in 1998, anticipating the completion of several bridges and tunnels that would connect District 2 to Ho Chi Minh City's central business district across the river. In 2003, Sasaki Associates won an international design competition to plan the site. The project is being carried out in stages, and is scheduled to be completed in 15 years, depending on the investment capital. Priority is given to the infrastructure investors with favorable assistance for the city government as well as preferential taxation. Urban layout The urban area covers an area of 7 square kilometres and consists of several sections: residences, pools, parks and office sections. Almost all buildings here are to be of 10 to 40-story. Once completed, this new urban area is intended to replace District 1 as the city's center.

It is a National Council of CILT International. First established in 1919 as the Chartered Institute of Transport, the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in the UK is a registered charity.  Overview  The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport delivers many services through nine professional sectors: Active Travel and Planning, Aviation, Bus and Coach, Freight Forwarding, Logistics and Supply Chain, Operations Management, Ports Maritime and Waterways, Rail and Transport Planning. These provide specialist activities and multi-sector engagement through their associated Forums and Policy Groups. The Institute currently has over 25 specialist Forums.  History  The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport International, formerly the Chartered Institute of Transport, was formed in London in 1919 and was granted its Royal Charter in 1926. The growth of its overseas sections led to a restructuring in 1994 under which 10 national councils were established in various parts of the world. The Institute operates as a co-ordinating body and custodian of the Royal Charter. The Chartered Institute of Transport in the UK was formed as the United Kingdom National Council and is the largest national council with over half the total worldwide membership of CILT. In 1999 the former Institute of Logistics and Transport (ILT) took over from CIT UK as the UK National Council. In April 2004 the Institute's membership voted in favour of ILT adopting the word 'Chartered' into its title. In May 2004 the Institute officially became 'The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in the UK'. All National Councils are effectively 'chartered' through their membership of CILT and are represented on its governing Council. CILT continues to hold the Royal Charter under the authority of the (UK) Privy Council. Subject to certain qualifications, individual members of any National Council hold chartered status under the authority of this Royal Charter. = Board representation = President The CILT President serves a one-year term beginning at the CILT President's Inauguration Lunch at the end of May.

In 2007, she was invited by Pierre Balmain, the French couturier, to present her fashion show in Paris. Her debut Paris collection was titled Presence of the Past, which drew on memories of her royal grandmother as well as giving a modern interpretation to traditional Thai costume. The following year, she presented her own fashion show in Paris.Fashion Week: Spring/Summer 2008. She designed a dress worn by the Thai entrant in the Miss Universe Thailand 2018 pageant.

Contemporary forms of popular culture, much like the traditional forms, are not only forms of entertainment but also aspects to distinguish contemporary Japan from the rest of the modern world. There is a large industry of music, films, and the products of a huge comic book industry, among other forms of entertainment. Game centers, bowling alleys, and karaoke parlors are well-known hangout places for teens while older people may play shogi or go in specialized parlors. After the end of the US occupation of Japan in 1952, Japanese popular culture has been deeply influenced by American media. However, rather than being dominated by American products, Japan localised these influences by appropriating and absorbing foreign influences into local media industries. Today, Japanese popular culture stands as one of the leading and most prominent popular cultures around the world. History In as early as 1920, a discussion revolving around the use of culture and media communication was being used as a strategy to enhance the international understanding of Japan's perspective was set in place. The discussion began when Japan aspired to become an imperial and colonial power, one that was equivalent to their Euro- American counterparts. This idea was interrupted once Japan was defeated in World War II. With the economic struggles Japan faced after the war, the question about using culture and media communication was once again brought up. In order for Japan to reinvent themselves and allow others to see their true colors, Japan focused on projecting a selected national image by exporting appealing cultural products including, animation, television programs, popular music, films, and fashion. The public diplomacy wanted to allow other countries to understand their position on various issues by acting directly on the people of foreign countries. With the popularity of television emerging in Asian countries, they produced a show that was supposed to demonstrate the actual lives of Japanese people.Iwabuchi, K. Pop-culture diplomacy in Japan: soft power, nation branding and the question of ‚Äòinternational cultural exchange‚Äô. International Journal of Cultural Policy, 2015. 419‚Äì425. Before the popular television show Oshin aired in Asian countries, Japanese people were perceived as ‚Äòculturally odorless.‚Äô With this new TV drama, a sense of commonality began to form between Japan and other Asian nations. This show was a testimony to the capability media culture can have on enhancing the international understanding of negative historical memories of Japanese colonialism and the hostility regarding the country's economic exploitation of the region.Iwabuchi, K. Pop-culture diplomacy in Japan: soft power, nation branding and the question of ‚Äòinternational cultural exchange‚Äô. International Journal of Cultural Policy, 2015. 420‚Äì432. The entertainment industry was vital to Japan's postwar reconstruction. The desire to create fantasies was present but, the economy drove the entertainment industry. Technology was the heart of Japan's rebuilding since, they believed it was the only reason they lost the war. Pop culture began to dominate the entertainment industry. For example, the Japanese used the resources they had in order to make toy cars that ultimately helped them rebuild the economy. After the Japanese were banned from using metal to make toys, they used old cans instead. In doing so, they were able to produce toys in exchange for food for the school children. The toy industry is just one of the industries that ultimately influenced pop culture during this era.Anne, Allison. Millennial Monsters, edited by Anne Allison, University of California Press, 2006. 35‚Äì40. Prior to World War II Japanese cinema produced films that supported the war efforts and encouraged Japanese citizens to fight for their country. The movie industry produced inspirational patriotic tales that portrayed Japanese militia as victors, heroes, and people who sacrificed themselves for a greater cause. However, the first cinematic blockbuster of the postwar era was Gojira which, did not share the same support as other films. For Japan, this film represented a return to popular entertainment that catered to the move towards technology. Gojira showed the destruction of Tokyo and the atomic bomb that victimized Japan during the war in order to gain opposition towards the war. Japanese cinema was dominated by militaristic storytelling and was controlled by the policies and agendas of Japan's totalitarian state. Films during the postwar era were used to foster new idols and icons in order for Japanese people to begin to reimagine themselves. Japanese cinemas produced films that demonstrated why they should be against the war and all the destruction and casualties that came along with it. As time went on the film industry progressed from targeting adult audiences to targeting children.Anne, Allison. Millennial Monsters, edited by Anne Allison, University of California Press, 2006. 42‚Äì48.  Cool Japan  Cool Japan („ÇØ„Éº„É´„Ç∏„É£„Éë„É≥ K≈´ru Japan) refers to the rise of Japan's soft power and prevalence internationally as a cultural influence.Thorsten Botz-Bornstein. These cultural elements project a message that markets and packages Japan as a nation of commerce and ‚Äúpop culture diplomacy\\" as opposed to a militarily focused and driven country. Japan's actions during World War II made it necessary for the nation to rebuild their national image; moving away from a national image of military dominance and into an image of cultural diplomacy. Initiated by the Japanese government, the creation of the ‚Äúsoft power‚Äù image emerged, and Japan began to sell its pop culture as its new non-military image in order to promote its own culture and reestablish a healthy and peaceful diplomacy with other nations. = Soft power =  Otaku  Otaku (Japanese: „Åä„Åü„Åè/ „Ç™„Çø„ÇØ) is a person who has strong interests or an obsession with Japanese pop subculture products and aesthetics.  Kawaii  sign used to sell kawaii goods at a shop in Japan The Japanese adjective kawaii can be translated as \\"cute\\" or \\"adorable\\" and is the drive behind one of Japan's most popular aesthetic cultures. Kawaii culture has its ties to another culture called sh≈çjo, a girl power type movement that has been commodified to sell the image of young girls alongside pop culture and the goods they might be interested in. Sh≈çjo can be seen as Japan's version of \\"the girl next door\\" with the cute and innocent aspects of kawaii. It has been associated with fancy goods (frilly and feminine type goods marketed toward young females), character goods (Sanrio, San-X, Studio Ghibli, anime/manga merchandise, etc. marketed to both males and females), entire fashion movements, and idols. As long as a product or person has \\"cute\\" elements, it can be seen as kawaii. In 2008, Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs moved away from just using traditional cultural aspects to promote their country and started using things like anime and Kawaii Ambassadors as well. The purpose of the Kawaii Ambassadors is to spread Japanese pop culture through their cute personas, using mostly fashion and music. This can also happen at the local level as seen by the mayor of Shibuya designating Kyary Pamyu Pamyu as the \\"Kawaii Ambassador of Harajuku\\", famously known as a hub of Japanese fashion, clothing stores, and youth culture. =Mascots= Kawaii in Japan has been a growing trend for many Japanese markets; they have been used in school all the way to large enterprises. The use of cute childish figures representing certain groups allows for those potentially frightened by them to have these playful mascots that represent them to create a sense of humanity between them. An example would be the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department mascot known as Pipo-kun, which is an orange-skinned, elfin creature with rabbit ears that are made to listen to the people and an antenna to stay in tune with what is happening. The use of Kawaii in public relations has been a large factor for many and will continue to be used by those who want to have an optimistic view of them.Matt Alt and Hiroko Yoda. Hello, Please! Very Helpful Kawaii Characters from Japan. Chronicle Books, 2007, 240 pages. One type of mascot in Japan noted for their 'Kawaii-ness' are advertising characters known as 'yuru-kiyara' (mascots representing their respective prefectures). Each year Japan celebrates a new winner; for example, 2011's champion was Kumamon (the Mon Bear) of Kumamoto prefecture, pulling in over 2.5 billion yen in merchandise sales across the nation that year.asianbeat.com/en/feature/culture_watch/37.html =Purikura= Purikura, a Japanese shorthand for \\"print club\\", are Japanese digital photo sticker booths. It has roots in Japanese kawaii culture, which involves an obsession with beautifying self-representation in photographic forms, particularly among females. By the 1990s, self-photography developed into a major preoccupation among Japanese schoolgirls, who took photos with friends and exchanged copies that could be pasted into kawaii albums. Purikura originate from the Japanese video game arcade industry. It was conceived in 1994 by Sasaki Miho, inspired by the popularity of girl photo culture and photo stickers in 1990s Japan. She worked for a Japanese game company, Atlus, where she suggested the idea, but it was initially rejected by her male bosses. Atlus eventually decided to pursue Miho's idea, and developed it with the help of a leading Japanese video game company, Sega, which later became the owner of Atlus. Sega and Atlus introduced the Print Club (Purinto Kurabu), the first purikura, in February 1995, initially at game arcades, before expanding to other popular culture locations such as fast food shops, train stations, karaoke establishments and bowling alleys. The success of the original Sega-Atlus machine led to other Japanese arcade game companies producing their own purikura, including SNK's Neo Print in 1996 and Konami's Puri Puri Campus (Print Print Campus) in 1997. Purikura produced what would later be called selfies. A purikura is essentially a cross between a traditional license/passport photo booth and an arcade video game, with a computer that is connected to a colour video camera and colour printer, and which allows the manipulation of digital images. It involves users posing in front of a camera within the compact booth, having their images taken, and then printing the photos with various effects designed to look kawaii. It presents a series of choices, such as desired backdrops, borders, insertable decorations, icons, text writing options, hair extensions, twinkling diamond tiaras, tenderized light effects, and predesigned decorative margins. These photographic filters were similar to the Snapchat filters that later appeared in the 2010s. Purikura became a popular form of entertainment among youths in Japan, and then across East Asia, in the 1990s. Japanese idols Momoiro Clover Z is ranked as number one among female idol groups according to 2013-2017 surveys.Japanese popular culture is highly surrounded by idealized celebrities who appear on many different forms of mass media. One type of popular celebrity an Idol. These idols are mostly girls portrayed for their \\"cuteness\\" and \\"innocence\\"; they are mostly intended to be role models that everyone adore and to promote a desirable image of fantastical happiness They must maintain a perfect public image and always try to set a good example to young people. Idols aim to play a wide range of roles as media personalities (tarento), e.g. pop or J-pop singers, panelists of variety programs, bit-part actors, models for magazines and advertisements. Alternative media idols include the emerging net idol, a form of idol in which growing ones popularity on the internet is its base foundation. Many net idol groups create a large standing online before transferring their career towards the professional Music Industry. Momoiro Clover Z was ranked as the number one female idol group in 2013‚Äì2017 surveys. During 2016, about 636 thousand people attended their live concerts, which was the highest record of all female musicians in Japan. The group has been ranked as the most popular female idol group from 2013 to 2017. The interactions between the Idols and their fans range from live video streaming, concerts, and handshake events. Because of their promotion as Idols, these celebrities appeal to many different demographics throughout Japan. The emotional attraction to cuteness, including the cuteness these idols have, is seen all over the world. However, the cute kawaii culture is openly visible throughout Japanese society both visually in manga, fashion, and stuffed animals and internally in situations such as the relationship between idols and their fans.  Fashion  Japan began to emulate Western fashion during the middle of the 19th century. By the beginning of the 21st century, this emulation has formed street fashion, a fashion style in which the wearer customizes outfits by adopting a mixture of current and traditional trends. Such clothes are generally home-made with the use of material purchased at stores. At present, there are many styles of dress in Japan, created from a mix of both local and foreign labels. Some of these styles are extreme and avant-garde, similar to the haute couture seen on European catwalks.Gothic Lolita Japanese fashionThough the styles have changed over the years, street fashion is still prominent in Japan today. Young adults can often be found wearing subculture attire in large urban fashion districts such as Harajuku, Ginza, Odaiba, Shinjuku and Shibuya. = Lolita = = Cosplay = Gein≈çkai Gein≈çkai (Japanese:Ëä∏ËÉΩÁïå), meaning \\"entertainment world\\" or \\"the world of show business\\", encompasses a wide variety of Japanese entertainment from movies and television (including talk shows, music shows, variety shows, etc.) to radio and now the Internet. Gein≈çjin is a term, often used interchangeably with tarento („Çø„É¨„É≥„Éà), which refers to members of the Gein≈çkai. Talent refers to a rather large group of people who appear on television from night to night, but cannot be quite classified as actors, singers, or models, or comedians (and are thus given the more vague appellation of \\"talent\\" instead). Talents usually appear on variety shows or talk shows and may later move into acting or singing if they are successful.  Television  = Modern television history = The demand for television had changed by the mid-1980s and the commonly viewed dramas such as family- oriented, historical, or mystery declined in popularity. These changes in demand were seen in national television throughout the world. The Japanese countered this decrease in demand by bringing in new celebrities known as \\"tarento\\" („Çø„É¨„É≥„Éà). These tarento celebrities are individuals whose influence stretches over different forms of entertainment such as contestants or hosts in game shows, commercials, or television dramas. Japanese tokusatsu superhero shows (also known as sentai shows) have had a significant influence on global popular culture. Examples include the Ultraman franchise, the Super Sentai franchise which was localised as Power Rangers in the Western world, and the Metal Hero franchise which was localised as VR Troopers in the West. = Television dramas = In the western world, dramas are known to be pieces of literature or plays that have a shocking twist or conflict that causes conflicting endings. However, in Japan, a television drama or \\"terebi dorama\\" („ÉÜ„É¨„Éì„Éâ„É©„Éû) is commonly thought of as a \\"Television Show\\" which can include drama, romance, and or comedy. = Current popular dramas = *Hanazakari no Kimitachi e *Hana Yori Dango  Film  The most popular Japanese films include the giant monster films (Kaiju Eiga) of Godzilla, Gamera, and the Ultraman Series. These Kaiju films were extremely popular in the 1960s and 1970s as the Kaiju Boom of Japan. Japanese cinema gained international recognition in 1950 with the release of Rashomon, which remains one of the most well known Japanese films. The film's director, Akira Kurosawa is one of the world's most acclaimed and influential film directors. Several of his subsequent films, such as Seven Samurai (1954) and Ran (1985), are considered among the greatest films ever made. Other noteworthy directors in this era of Japanese cinema include Yasujir≈ç Ozu, Masaki Kobayashi, Kenji Mizoguchi, Kon Ichikawa, Keisuke Kinoshita and Ishir≈ç Honda. The following Japanese film genres have had a significant influence on global popular culture: *Jidaigeki (Japanese historical fiction) **Samurai cinema (chanbara) examples include Akira Kurosawa films such as Seven Samurai, The Hidden Fortress and Yojimbo **Ninja fiction see Ninjas in popular culture *Tokusatsu (Japanese science fiction) **Kaiju (giant monster films) examples include Godzilla, Gamera and Ultraman *Anime films see Anime section below *J-horror examples include the Ring and Grudge franchises  Anime  Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors (1944), the first feature-length anime film Anime (Japanese: „Ç¢„Éã„É°) is a movie or television episode of sorts which utilizes animation as an art style iconic to Japan in order to convey a story. Unlike western cartoons, anime can be distinguished by its detail in character design, large array of facial expressions, in-depth character development, wide target audience and rare use of talking animals. These traits are used in order to better the connection between a viewer and the characters. Most of the time, anime is based on animated comics called manga, which is an ancient form of comic writing which dates back to the 12th century.Tze-yue G. Hu: Frames of Anime: Culture and Image-Building. Hong Kong University Press, 2010. The world of animated films in Japanese popular culture has been a growing trend since the 1920s. Influenced by Walt Disney and his animated characters, Osamu Tezuka (1925‚Äì1989), also known as \\"manga no kamisama\\" (which means, \\"God of Comics\\")Drazen, P: Anime Explosion!: the what? Why? & wow! of Japanese animation. Stone Bridge Press, Inc., 2003. would begin his forty-year evolution of animation, or anime, that would change the content of Japanese comic books. With the creation of his first animated character Astro Boy that was unlike any other animated character; he found the hearts of the Japanese public with a robotic boy who has spiky hair, eyes as big as fists, with rockets on his feet. Studio Ghibli, a Japanese animation film studio, also contributed to anime's worldwide success through films including \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\", \\"Ponyo\\", and \\"Spirited Away\\" (winner of the Golden Bear award in 2002 and the Academy Award for Best Animation Film in 2003). For these works, the studio's current president Hayao Miyazaki is often credited as a visionary in animation. The success of the Pok√©mon franchise has been credited by people such as Nissim Otmazgin and sociologist Anne Alison as popularizing anime in the United States. The anime market has also been described as owing greatly to the crucial role of fans as cultural agents, the deterritorializing effects of globalization, the domestication and heavy editing of anime to suit local tastes, and being part of the wider global flow of Japanese pop culture and \\"soft power\\". Otmazgin argues that the rise of anime in the United States is a result of the sophisticated graphic quality, a wide thematic diversity, and an inclination to reject the Disney convention of a happy ending. He further states that anime was a tool in which Japan could gain popularity with their pop culture and give Americans a taste of something unique and interesting in the media. As anime has grown in its variety of viewers, genres, and themes, the industry has become more prevalent in society. In modern Japan, anime has become so popular that memorable characters have frequently been made into byproducts such as figurines and video games.  Manga  The word Manga, when translated directly, means ‚Äúwhimsical drawings‚Äù. Manga are typically 'comic books' as the West understands them; rather, they represent pieces of Japanese culture and history. The 'manga' style has an extensive history, beginning sometime in the 10th century; scrolls from that period depict animals as part of the 'upper class', behaving as a typical human would in similar situations. Such scrolls would go on to be known as the Ch≈çj≈´ giga or ‚ÄúThe Animal Scrolls‚Äù.Mark Wheeler Macwilliams. Japanese Visual Culture: Exploration in the World of Manga and Anime. M.E. Sharpe, 2008, 352 pages. Scrolls found later on in the 12th century would depict images of religion such as the Gaki Zoshi (Hungry Ghost Scrolls) and the Jigoku zoshi (Hell Scrolls). While both dealt with various aspects of religion, unlike ‚ÄúThe Animal Scrolls‚Äù, these provided a more instructive viewpoint, rather than a comedic style. Manga are more significant, culturally, than Western comic books (though many fill the same role). Originally, manga were printed in daily newspapers; in the Second World War, newsprint rationing caused a downsurge in manga popularity. In the post- war 1950s, they made a resurgence in the form of ‚Äúpicture card shows‚Äù, which were a style of storytelling supplemented by the use of illustrations, and the highly popular ‚Äúrental manga‚Äù that would allow their readers to rent these illustrated books for a period of time.Sharon Kinsella. Adult Manga: Culture and Power in Contemporary Japanese Society. University of Hawaii, 2000, 228 pages.  Video games  Video gaming is a major industry in Japan. Japanese game development is often identified with the golden age of video games, including Nintendo under Shigeru Miyamoto and Hiroshi Yamauchi, Sega during the same time period, and other companies such as Taito, Namco, Capcom, and Square Enix, among others. Music = J-pop = = City pop = = Visual kei = Visual kei (Japanese: „É¥„Ç£„Ç∏„É•„Ç¢„É´Á≥ª), also known as \\"visual style\\", is a prominent wave in Japan's music world that encapsulates bands with androgynous appearances who play a variety of music styles ranging from heavy metal to electronic. Similar to cosplay, visual kei artists typically cross- dress and flaunt very embellished costumes, make-up, and hairstyles. Not many of the bands include female members, however a majority of their audiences are young females. Starting in the 1980s and rising to popularity in the 1990s, the first generation of visual kei was heavily influenced by western rock and metal musicians such as Kiss. One of the pioneers is a band called X Japan who are still active. Although, the first wave of visual kei came to an end at the time of X Japan's lead guitarists death in 1999. A few years later, the second wave called neo- visual kei transpired and took the genre onto a slightly different path than before. Internet Internet in Japan didn't take off until 1993 when the nation's government approved and installed its first commercial Internet service provider. Japan was the 14th country in the world to start using the internet; many reasons have been cited as the reason behind its slow movement such as bad timing, the government deeming internet access was more for academic use, fear of change and taking risks, an initial lack of competition in the telecommunications field, the difficulty of using a keyboard with a 2,000+ kanji-based language, and high rates causing hefty bills after just a few hours of internet usage. Until the mid-1990s, it was hard for Japanese society to access the internet and there wasn't much for them to do once they did get on. Once it did kick off, mobile phones were preferred over PCs or laptop computers, which has shaped how Japan's internet culture is interfaced, having to adapt to smaller screens and having a more leisurely attitude towards it. = Internet caf√©s = Internet caf√©s in Japan are on the rise in popularity, not just as a place to hang out but as a place to live. These cafes offer internet access in small, private rooms the size of a cubicle with some offering services such as unlimited drinks, doubling as a manga cafe, showers, blankets, and use of the address to those that choose to live there. Internet cafes are now a haven for Net cafe refugees of all ages who would otherwise be homeless; many people can afford to rent out a room at one considering they are not expected to pay other bills that come with an apartment such as deposits, fees, furnishing a living space, and utilities. In 2018 the Tokyo Metropolitan Government conducted a survey using 502 internet and manga cafes in the Tokyo area and found through the information provided that an estimated 15,000 people stay at these cafes during the week with roughly 4,000 of this number being those that are homeless and the rest using the cafe instead of a hotel. A third of the guests claim to have unstable jobs. By age, the bulk of the guests are in their 30s with a smaller but still significant portion of people in their 50s. In 2008, the Health, Labor, and Welfare Ministry requested the budget for a program that would help internet cafe refugees gain permanent employment by offering a loan program for living expenses as long as they take classes on vocational job skills and training.  Mobile phone culture  = Keitai shousetsu (cell phone novel) = Keitai Shousetsu (lit. cell phone novel) was a phenomenon originally unique to Japan but spread quickly to other countries like China, India, Italy, Switzerland, Finland, South Africa, the US, and Brazil. Because of Japan's preference for mobile phones over computers, cell phone novels were an inexpensive way for amateur authors to get their works out into the world either by text message or email, eventually evolving into subscriptions via websites. Deep Love was the first of its kind, written in 2002 by Yoshi; it was adapted into manga series, a television show, and a film. The works were put out in short installments due to the character limit capability of a cell phone which is ideal for commuters to read in between train stops. Oftentimes, these works are put into print; in 2007, Japan saw ten of that year's bestselling novels derived from a cell phone novel. Considering they are mostly written by teenagers and young adults, they center on themes like relationships, drug use, pregnancy, rape, and prostitution. It is a trend that older adults are finding hard to indulge in because of the seemingly violent themes, use of emojis to convey emotion and save space, along with the absence of diverse and lengthy vocabulary. = Selfie = The modern selfie has origins in Japanese kawaii culture, particularly the purikura phenomenon of 1990s Japan. To capitalize on the purikura phenomenon, Japanese mobile phones began including a front-facing camera, which facilitated the creation of selfies, during the late 1990s to early 2000s. The iPhone 4 (2010) adopted the front-facing camera feature from earlier Japanese and Korean camera phones, and helped popularize the selfie internationally outside of East Asia. Photographic features in purikura were later adopted by smartphone apps such as Instagram and Snapchat, including scribbling graffiti or typing text over selfies, adding features that beautify the image, and photo editing options such as cat whiskers or bunny ears. Martial arts Popular Japanese martial arts include judo, ju- jitsu, aikido, and Okinawan martial arts such as karate.

Progress in recycling has resulted in a major reduction in dumping. Tire recycling, or rubber recycling, is the process of recycling waste tires that are no longer suitable for use on vehicles due to wear or irreparable damage. These tires are a challenging source of waste, due to the large volume produced, the durability of the tires, and the components in the tire that are ecologically problematic. Because tires are highly durable and non-biodegradable, they can consume valued space in landfills. In 1990, it was estimated that over 1 billion scrap tires were in stockpiles in the United States. As of 2015, only 67 million tires remain in stockpiles. From 1994 to 2010, the European Union increased the amount of tires recycled from 25% of annual discards to nearly 95%, with roughly half of the end-of-life tires used for energy, mostly in cement manufacturing. Newer technology, such as pyrolysis and devulcanization, has made tires suitable targets for recycling despite their bulk and resilience. Aside from use as fuel, the main end use for tires remains ground rubber. In 2017, 13% of U.S. tires removed from their primary use were sold in the used tire market. Of the tires that were scrapped, 43% were burnt as tire- derived fuel, with cement manufacturing the largest user, another 25% were used to make ground rubber, 8% were used in civil engineering projects, 17% were disposed of in landfills and 8% had other uses.  Tire life cycle  The tire life cycle can be identified by the following six steps: #Product developments and innovations such as improved compounds and camber tire shaping increase tire life, increments of replacement, consumer safety, and reduce tire waste. #Proper manufacturing and quality of delivery reduces waste at production. # Direct distribution through retailers, reduces inventory time and ensures that the life span and the safety of the products are explained to customers. # Consumers' use and maintenance choices like tire rotation and alignment affect tire wear and safety of operation. # Manufacturers and retailers set policies on return, retread, and replacement to reduce the waste generated from tires and assume responsibility for taking the 'tire to its grave' or to its reincarnation. #Recycling tires by developing strategies that combust or process waste into new products, creates viable businesses, and fulfilling public policies.  Landfill disposal  Tires are not desired at landfills, due to their large volumes and 75% void space.Liu,H., Mead, J., Stacer, R. Chelsea Center For Recycling And Economic Development. (1998). Environmental Impacts of Recycling Rubber in Light Fill Applications: Summary & Evaluation of Existing Literature University of Massachusetts Tires can trap methane gases, causing them to become buoyant, or bubble to the surface. This 'bubbling' effect can damage landfill liners that have been installed to help keep landfill contaminants from polluting local surface and ground water. Shredded tires are now being used in landfills, replacing other construction materials, for a lightweight back-fill in gas venting systems, leachate collection systems, and operational liners. Shredded tire material may also be used to cap, close, or daily cover landfill sites. Scrap tires as a back-fill and cover material are also more cost-effective, since tires can be shredded on-site instead of hauling in other fill materials.  Stockpiles and legal dumping  Used tires in foreground waiting to be shredded and shredded tires in background. Tire stockpiles create a great health and safety risk. Tire fires can occur easily, burning for months and creating substantial pollution in the air and ground. Recycling helps to reduce the number of tires in storage. An additional health risk, tire piles provide harborage for vermin and a breeding ground for mosquitoes that may carry diseases. Illegal dumping of scrap tires pollutes ravines, woods, deserts, and empty lots; which has led many states to pass scrap tire regulations requiring proper management. Tire amnesty day events, in which community members can deposit a limited number of waste tires free of charge, can be funded by state scrap tire programs, helping decrease illegal dumping and improper storage of scrap tires. Tire storage and recycling are sometimes linked with illegal activities and lack of environmental awareness.  Uses  Although tires are usually burnt, not recycled, efforts are continuing to find value. Tires can be reclaimed into, among other things, the hot melt asphalt, typically as crumb rubber modifier‚Äîrecycled asphalt pavement (CRM‚ÄîRAP),Kandhal PS. (1992). WASTE MATERIALS IN HOT MIX ASPHALT ‚Äì AN OVERVIEW . National Center for Asphalt Technology.T. E. Baker (2003).

Cementitious Composites Containing Recycled Tire Rubber: An Overview of Engineering Properties and Potential Applications . Cement, Concrete, and Aggregates. Efforts have been made to use recycled tires as raw material for new tires, but such tires may integrate recycled materials no more than 5% by weight, and tires that contain recycled material are inferior to new tires, suffering from reduced tread life and lower traction. Tires have also been cut up and used in garden beds as bark mulch to hold in the water and to prevent weeds from growing. Some \\"green\\" buildings, both private and public, have been made from old tires. Pyrolysis can be used to reprocess the tires into fuel gas, oils, solid residue (char), and low-grade carbon black, which cannot be used in tire manufacture. A pyrolysis method which produces activated carbon and high-grade carbon black has been suggested.Wojtowicz MA, Serio MA. (1996). Pyrolysis of scrap tires: Can it be profitable? . Chemtech. =Cement manufacturing= Used tires being fed mid-kiln to a pair of long cement kilns Old tires can be used as an alternative fuel in the manufacturing of Portland cement, a key ingredient in concrete. Whole tires are commonly introduced into cement kilns, by rolling them into the upper end of a preheater kiln, or by dropping them through a slot midway along a long wet kiln. In either case, the high gas temperatures (1000‚Äì1200 ¬∞C) cause almost instantaneous, complete and smokeless combustion of the tire. Alternatively, tires are chopped into 5‚Äì10 mm chips, in which form they can be injected into a precalciner combustion chamber. Some iron input is required in manufacturing cement, so the iron content of steel- belted tires is beneficial to the process.Use of waste derived fuels in cement industry: a review , Nickolaos Chatziaras, Constantinos S.

In a 2003 report cited by the U.S. EPA, it is stated that markets (\\"both recycling and beneficial use\\") existed for 80.4% of scrap tires, about 233 million tires per year. Assuming per tire, the 2003 report predicts a total weight of about from tires.22.5 lb working figure retrieved on 20 February 2010 from: / New products derived from waste tires generate more economic activity than combustion or other low multiplier production, while reducing waste stream without generating excessive pollution and emissions from recycling operations. *Construction materials. Entire homes can be built with whole tires by filling them with earth and covering them with concrete, a common material in earthships. They are used in civil engineering applications such as sub-grade fill and embankments, back-fill for walls and bridge abutments, sub-grade insulation for roads, landfill projects, and septic system drain fields. Tires are also bound together and used as different types of barriers such as: collision reduction, erosion control, rainwater runoff, blasting mats, wave action that protects piers and marshes, and sound barriers between roadways and residences. *Artificial reefs are built using tires that are bonded together in groups, there is some controversy on how effective tires are as an artificial reef system, an example is The Osborne Reef Project which has become an environmental nightmare that will cost millions of dollars to rectify. *The process of stamping and cutting tires is used in some apparel products, such as sandals and as a road sub-base, by connecting together the cut sidewalls to form a flexible net. *The markets predicted by the 2003 report were: tire derived fuel (TDF) using 130 million tires, civil engineering projects using 56 million tires, ground rubber turned into molded rubber products using 18 million tires, ground rubber turned into rubber-modified asphalt using 12 million tires, Exported items using 9 million tires, cut, stamped and punched products using 6.5 million tires, and agricultural and miscellaneous uses 3 million tires. *Shredded tires, known as Tire Derived Aggregate (TDA), have many civil engineering applications. TDA can be used as a back-fill for retaining walls, fill for landfill gas trench collection wells, back-fill for roadway landslide repair projects as well as a vibration damping material for railway lines. *Ground and crumb rubber, also known as size-reduced rubber, can be used in both paving type projects and in mold-able products. These types of paving are: Rubber Modified Asphalt (RMA), Rubber Modified Concrete, and as a substitution for an aggregate. Examples of rubber-molded products are carpet padding or underlay, flooring materials, dock bumpers, patio decks, railroad crossing blocks, livestock mats, sidewalks, rubber tiles and bricks, movable speed bumps, and curbing/edging. The rubber can be molded with plastic for products like pallets and railroad ties. Athletic and recreational areas can also be paved with the shock absorbing rubber-molded material. Rubber from tires is sometimes ground into medium-sized chunks and used as rubber mulch. Rubber crumb can also be used as an infill, alone or blended with coarse sand, as in infill for grass-like synthetic turf products such as Field-turf. *Steel mills can use tires as a carbon source, replacing coal or coke in steel manufacturing. *Tires are also often recycled for use on basketball courts and new shoe products. = Tire pyrolysis = The pyrolysis method for recycling used tires is a technique which heats whole or shredded tires in a reactor vessel containing an oxygen-free atmosphere. In the reactor the rubber is softened after which the rubber polymers break down into smaller molecules. These smaller molecules eventually vaporize and exit from the reactor. These vapors can be burned directly to produce power or condensed into an oily type liquid, generally used as a fuel. Some molecules are too small to condense. They remain as a gas which can be burned as fuel. The minerals that were part of the tire, about 40% by weight, are removed as solid ashes. When performed properly, the tire pyrolysis process is a clean operation and produces little emissions or waste; however, concerns about air pollution due to incomplete combustion as is the case with tire fires has been documented. The properties of the gas, liquid, and solid output are determined by the type of feed-stock used and the process conditions. For instance whole tires contain fibers and steel. Shredded tires have most of the steel and sometimes most of the fiber removed. Processes can be either batch or continuous. The energy required to drive the decomposition of the rubber include using directly fired fuel (like a gas oven), electrical induction (like an electrically heated oven) or by microwaves (like a microwave oven). Sometimes a catalyst is used to accelerate the decomposition. The choice of feed-stock and process can affect the value of the finished products. The historical issue of tire pyrolysis has been the solid mineral stream, which accounts for about 40% of the output. The steel can be removed from the solid stream with magnets for recycling. The remaining solid material, often referred to as \\"char\\", has had little or no value other than possibly as a low grade carbon fuel. Char is the destroyed remains of the original carbon black used to reinforce and provide abrasion resistance to the tire. The solid stream also includes the minerals used in rubber manufacturing. This high volume component of tire pyrolysis is a major impediment, although this theme continues to be a source of innovation. = Cryogenic recycling = cryogenic recycling of tires, in 1995. Tires can be frozen using cryogens, or super-cold fluids, then broken down and made into a material called \\"crumb,\\" which can be used in asphalt road beds, agricultural hoses, and truck bed liners. =Repurposing= Three boys are on a tire swing Car tires as seats in Thailand. Tire art Aside from recycling old tires, the old tire can be put to a new use. Old tires are sometimes converted into a swing for play. The innovative use allows for an easy way to find a purpose for an existing old tire not suitable for road use. Used tires are also employed as exercise equipment for athletic programs such as American football. One classic conditioning drill that hones players' speed and agility is the \\"Tire Run\\" where tires are laid out side by side, with each tire on the left a few inches ahead of the tire on the right in a zigzag pattern. Athletes then run through the tire pattern by stepping in the center of each tire. The drill forces athletes to lift their feet above the ground higher than normal to avoid tripping. Other athletic uses include tire flipping (tractor or large truck tires typically used) or for upper cardio conditioning by hitting a tire repetitively with a sledge hammer. Re-purposed tires can also be harnessed as an affordable alternative building material used in the framework of rammed Earth thermal mass dwellings. This is beneficial across scales of production such as individually sustainable housing. Rows of stacks of tyres are often used as barriers in motor racing circuits as a method of dissipating kinetic energy over a longer period of time during a crash, comparatively to striking a less malleable material such as a concrete or steel wall. Many cattle farmers re-purpose old tractor tires as water troughs for their cattle by placing them over natural springs or by piping stream water into them. These tires contain the water and allow it to pool for the cattle without any additional interaction from the farmer. Most farmers also include a drainage pipe near the top or in the center of the tire so excess water can drain off to prevent overflow and erosion around the outside of the tire where the cattle would be.  Environmental concerns  Due to their heavy metal and other pollutant content, tires pose a risk for the leaching of toxins into the groundwater when placed in wet soils. Research has shown that very little leaching occurs when shredded tires are used as light fill material; however, limitations have been put on use of this material; each site should be individually assessed determining if this product is appropriate for given conditions. For both above and below water table applications, the preponderance of evidence shows that TDA (tire derived aggregate, or shredded tires) will not cause primary drinking water standards to be exceeded for metals. Moreover, TDA is unlikely to increase levels of metals with primary drinking water standards above naturally occurring background levels.

He was only 14 years and nine months old when he succumbed to typhoid during the Gallipoli campaign. He was one of 20 Australian soldiers under the age of 18 known to have died in World War I.  Early life  James Martin was born to Amelia and Charles Martin on 3 January 1901 in Tocumwal, New South Wales. His father was born Charles Marks, in Auckland, New Zealand; however, after emigrating to Australia and settling in Tocumwal, he changed his name to Martin to avoid discrimination for being Jewish.Hill 2001, pp. 10‚Äì11. Charles worked as a grocer, handyman and (horse-drawn) cab driver, while Amelia was born in Bendigo in 1876 to Thomas and Frances Park. Her parents had emigrated to Australia during the gold rush in the 1850s.Hill 2001, p. 11. The youngest of twelve children, she married Charles just before her 18th birthday.Hill 2001, p. 12. Martin's family moved to many different suburbs in and around Melbourne before finally settling in Hawthorn in 1910.Hill 2001, p. 16. He was the third of six children, and the only son. He attended Manningtree Road State School from 1910 to 1915, during which time he also received basic military training as a junior cadet under the compulsory training scheme.Hill 2001, p. 18.  World War I  After the outbreak of World War I Martin enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 12 April 1915, against the wishes of his family. His parents finally agreed however when he made it clear that he would sign on under an assumed name and never write to them if they did not consent.Hill 2001, pp. 36-37. He gave a false date of birth to the recruiting officer, claiming to be 18, when he was actually 14 years and three months. His father had earlier tried to enlist but had been rejected as being too old.Hill 2001, p. 34. Martin joined the 1st Reinforcements of the 21st Battalion as a private and trained in Broadmeadows and Seymour (later Puckapunyal) camps in Victoria before boarding HMAT Berrima in June 1915 to deploy to Egypt, arriving there in late July.Hill 2001, p. 64. In late August, following the failed August Offensive, he was sent to Gallipoli on the steamer HMT Southland, to take part in the fighting against the Turks, which had by that time developed into a bloody stalemate. En route, Southland was torpedoed by a German submarine off the island of Lemnos and Martin was rescued after spending four hours in the water.Hill 2001, p. 136. After being picked up, he rejoined his battalion at Mudros Island where they were transferred to the transport ship Abassieh on 7 September to resume their voyage to Gallipoli.Hill 2001, p. 94. The following morning, just before 2:00 am, Martin's platoon, 4 Platoon, landed at Watson's Pier in Anzac Cove.Hill 2001, p. 97. He then served in trenches around Courtney's Post, which was positioned on the ridge overlooking Monash Valley. During this time he wrote to his family telling them that \\"the Turks are still about away from us\\" and asked them not to worry about him as \\"I am doing splendid over here\\". Throughout his time in Gallipoli, although his family were writing to him, Martin did not receive any letters from home due to a breakdown in the mail system.Hill 2001, p. 118. As the campaign dragged on, winter approached and the weather on the Gallipoli Peninsula began to take its toll on the soldiers in the trenches. Following a period of cold temperatures and heavy rain Martin contracted enteric fever in the trenches. After suffering mild symptoms for about a fortnight during which time he refused treatment,Hill 2001, p. 123. he was subsequently evacuated to the hospital ship on 25 October 1915 after he developed diarrhoea. He died of heart failure that night, at the age of 14 and nine months, and was buried at sea the next day. At the time of his death only Martin's parents and his best friend, Cec Hogan‚Äîwho was himself only 16‚Äîknew Martin's real age.Hill 2001, pp. 134‚Äì135. Nevertheless, on 18 December 1915, Melbourne's Herald newspaper reported Martin's death in an article titled \\"Youngest Soldier Dies\\".Hill 2001, p. 135. Although he was the youngest known AIF soldier killed during the war, Martin was likely not the youngest soldier to have enlisted. Albert Dunnicliff is believed to have enlisted a week before his 14th birthday, and served for 16 months, including a period on the Western Front, before being discharged.  Honours and awards  Martin was awarded the 1914‚Äì15 Star, the British War Medal, and the Victory Medal. His name is recorded on the Australian memorial at Lone Pine and on the Australian War Memorial roll of honour in Canberra. 100x30px 100x30px 100x30px  Notes   References  * Category:1901 births Category:1915 deaths Category:Australian military personnel killed in World War I Category:Child soldiers Category:Australian people of Jewish descent Category:Australian people of New Zealand descent Category:Burials at sea ","title":"Jim Martin (Australian soldier)"},{"id":"9890909","title":"Lauderdale County School District (Mississippi)"},{"id":"9890917","text":"Mangamahu is a hill-country farming and forestry community in the middle reaches of the Whangaehu River valley, in the Whanganui District and Rangitikei District of Manawat≈´-Whanganui, New Zealand. It is centred on the village of Mangamahu, which is situated on river flats where the Mangamahu stream flows into the Whangaehu river. Mangamahu has a primary school (5 - 10 children) which has been open since 1894 and a War Memorial hall built in 1952. The hotel and the general store at Mangamahu closed in the early 1970s due to improved roads, and a decline in wool and meat prices. Farmland on poorer hill soils at the lower end of the valley then began a conversion to pine plantations. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"gentle stream\\" for Mangamahu. History =Pre-European history= The Mangamahu river flats were formed by huge mud slides or \\"lahars\\" (c. 1200 and 1520 AD) flowing down the Whangaehu river from the crater lake of Mount Ruapehu. The river flat on which Mangamahu School is situated is the site of an old Ngati Apa Maori camp-site named Kohanga. This was occupied in summer by bird-snaring and eel-trapping groups from further down the Whangaehu, and also used as a way station by those travelling the trail up the ridge between the Whangaehu river and Mangamahu stream, from the fortified pa at Manumanu (near the mouth of the Mangawhero river) to Karioi, and then across the Rangipo Desert and Lake Taupo to the Waikato and Rotorua. Kohanga and Manumanu were destroyed during the musket wars in 1840 and 1843, and most of the surviving inhabitants of the upper valley moved west to Parikino on the Whanganui River.M Campion, P Garland, J Morris The Road to Mangamahu, a history of the Whangaehu River Valley from Reid's Hill to Mt View 1988 Mervyn Addenbrooke, Home From the Hill, 1990 =European settlement= British colonists began buying the land in the 1870s. James MacDonald was the first white settler, introducing sheep to his clearing in the bush at 'Glenaladale' in 1872. His wife joined him there in 1875. During the 1880s the old Maori trail through Mangamahu was developed into a bench track for pack horses (Hales Track). It followed the Whangaehu river flats to the Mangamahu Stream, then went up the northern ridgeline of the Mangamahu Stream to Bald Hill, and on to Karioi. It gave settlers access to the nearer forest-covered hills of the area, (now Ruakiwi, Inzevar, Aranui and Mt View farms) and enabled packhorses to bring wool from sheep grazing on the high back-country tussock lands at Ngamatea and Waiouru. From Waiouru the trail went on to Moawhango and then to Napier. In 1879 Arthur Ellis and Allan Robinson bought 140 hectares on the site of the present Mangamahu village. To assist the many settlers and labourers moving up and down Hales Track, they developed a supply store to which a post office was attached in 1889. Then in 1891 they built an accommodation house, and by 1894 this was a licensed 12-bedroom hotel. A blacksmith's shop and saddlery were added and served customers as far away as Taihape and Raetihi. In 1891, work began on widening Hales Track into a wagon road, The Ridge Road. From 1894 to 1908, Mangamahu village was a busy district supply centre with wagons moving up the Ridge Road to farms and railway construction sites in the central high country as far away as Ngamatapouri and the Waimarino, and with travellers going across the island from Wanganui to Napier. The tracks and roads in the hills behind the village were still very difficult to negotiate and Royal Mail contractor Annie Shaw (Barb Wire Annie) became a well known for her grit in getting her pack-horses delivering the mail across the hills in the winter mud from 1904 to 1910. Then in 1908 the Main Trunk Railway line through the centre of the island was completed and Mangamahu's importance as a transport hub greatly shrunk. The Ridge Road was closed in 1922. Access to Ruakiwi, Inzevar, Aranui and Mt View farms was changed to the new \\"River Road\\" that had been cut out of the steep papa bluffs to follow the river. It is now known as the Upper Whangaehu Valley Road. Farm houses and woolsheds up on the cold windy ridges were dismantled and rebuilt down by the river. The macrocarpa tree shelter belts around the old farm houses are now significant landmarks. =20th century= Merv Addenbrooke was born at Mangamahu in 1901. He worked as a bushman, fencer and shearer on local farms there until 1930. Merv's 1991 autobiography Home from the Hill (in NZ public libraries and also online) has detailed anecdotes about his childhood and farm-working days in Mangamahu between 1905 and 1930. In 1930 Merv married and moved to a dairy farm at Putaruru. He died in 1993. By 1945, Mangamahu village had a school (with 12 pupils), general store/post office, a hotel, a bus and taxi service, a general carrier and a timber mill. In the surrounding district there were farmers, shepherds, fencers, roadmen, bridge builders, itinerant shearers and scrub-cutters. In the 1940s, most of the scrub-cutters were middle-aged Catholic men who could not get a divorce, and who wanted to disappear from sight. But by 1948, the first Fijian Indians scrub-cutters had arrived. The dusty corrugated gravel road to Wanganui was a boneshaking one- hour journey, while the River Road, from Mangamahu to Mount View, was narrow and winding with steep bluffs and many slips in winter. Not many people had cars, and gathering at the Mangamahu store each evening at 5pm to meet Tommy Thompson's bus was an important social gathering. There were many sporting activities, especially rugby, golf and pony club, but also tennis, cricket and badminton. The rifle shooting club that had flourished in the 1920s and 1930s had died out, but pig hunting was still popular. The Tangiwai disaster greatly affected Mangamahu during the Christmas week of 1953. A lahar down the Whangaehu river from the Mt Ruapehu crater lake reached Mangamahu at 7am on Christmas morning. Wreckage of a passenger train and dozens of bodies were in the muddy flow. Over the next four weeks, local settlers recovered the bodies of about sixty victims from out of the river gorges near Mangamahu. In 1951 the first topdressing planes arrived, spreading super-phosphate to make more grass grow on the steep hills of the sheep-farms. Not much fertilizer at first, but by 1960 the local carrier was carting 2000 tonne a year to the various airstrips in the district. The topdressing enabled much more wool and sheep-meat to be produced, and Mangamahu bard John Archer describes the unexpected social consequences. In 1973 the price of oil skyrocketed, and this was followed by a reform government that abolished farm subsidies that had encouraged farmers to produce more than the market could absorb. Sheep farming became uneconomic on the more marginal dissected slip-prone hills in the middle of the valley, and \\"Queen Street farmers\\", investors from Auckland, bought up thousands of hectares to plant pine plantations. The pine trees greatly reduced erosion of the soft soil forming the steep hills in the Mangamahu valleys. Massey University lecturer Paul Kaplan interviewed every person in Mangamahu to find out how social conditions affected farm production. Two findings of his made the national news. He discovered that when Mangamahu farmers reached the age of about 52, they upgraded their farmhouse kitchens and then sat in them all winter, instead of getting out onto the hills and increasing production. So to maintain productivity, said Kaplan, the farmer's oldest son needed to be married by the age of 26. The farmer could then trust his son with 'the chequebook,' and the energetic young man would spend the winter on the hill-tops improving the land.Paul Kaplan, Social Aspects of Productivity: Hill-Country Sheep-Beef Farms in the Mangamahu Valley , 1979 The 1989 comedy Came a Hot Friday is about two 1949 con-men had some woolshed and river scenes filmed at Mangamahu. A suspension bridge was specially built over the Whangaehu River at Tokorangi farm for a car crash at the end of the film. =21st century= After the downturn in 1973, former sheep paddocks began to be planted in pines, and a corresponding decline in the output of fat lambs, wethers, wool and cattle from the valley. By the 1990s, huge numbers of pine trees had been planted. Consequently, there were fewer heavy truck-and-trailer journeys on the valley roads, and road- maintenance costs were low. But Pinus radiata takes only 25 years to grow to a loggable size in New Zealand, and by 2009 thousands of tonnes of pine awaited removal on the valley's sub-standard roads. On 28 June 2013, the Wanganui Chronicle reported that Wyley's Bridge, the main access to Mangamahu, needed urgent repairs so trucks could keep using it until a new bridge was built. Inferior timber had been used when the wood and wire-rope suspension bridge was built in 1957, and the bridge transoms were now rotting. Andy Collins, a leading farmer at Mangamahu, stated that 15 to 20 million dollars of agricultural product were produced in the valley each year. This consisted of nearly 5000 cattle, more than 100,000 sheep, 500 tonne of wool, 600 tonne of kiwifruit, 1000 tonne of maize and a small number of deer. An average of 2000 tonne of fertilizer was carried into the valley each year. Repairs were started on the bridge a week later, and then construction started on a new 'coat-hanger' bridge that was opened in mid-2015.

It was the final land battle of the Finnish campaign in the Great Northern War. The Swedish detachment, consisting almost entirely of Finnish troops, were defeated by the numerically superior Russian force. As a result, all of Finland fell under Russian military occupation for the rest of the War; a seven-year period of hardship known in Finland as the Great Wrath. The Kyr√∂ Distillery Company named its Napue rye gin after the battle in 2014. Prelude By 1703 Russian forces had reached the inner parts of the Gulf of Finland, and founded the city of Saint Petersburg. Since the Swedish main army was engaged in Poland and later in Russia, Sweden was hard pressed to defend its Baltic territories. After the battle of Poltava, Russia took all of Livonia, Estonia and Ingria, as well as the counties of Viborg, Savonlinna and Kexholm.Numerous updated reviews of military and history experts: Brigade of Ostrobothnia, Colonel C-B.J.Petander, General Apraxin etc. When Charles XII of Sweden refused to enter peace negotiations, Denmark and Russia drew up plans with the purpose to threaten Stockholm. Two attack routes were considered: one through southern Sweden and the other through Finland and the √Öland islands. The southern attack was deemed more important, but the attack on Finland was to be carried out in order to tie down as much of the remaining Swedish army as possible there. However, the attack from the south was successfully fended off by Magnus Stenbock's victory at Helsingborg in 1710. The Russian attack on Finland never developed as planned. Since Peter the Great was engaged in a war against Turkey, the resulting lack of soldiers forced him to postpone the conquest of √Öbo. Initial Russian actions in Finland consisted of raids and reconnaissance operations, with the purpose of occupying southeastern Finland and devastating it in order to deny Swedish forces a base of operations against the Russian-controlled areas around Saint Petersburg. Significant Russian military action in Finland began in 1713, after logistical problems caused the failure of an initial foray the previous year. Already in May, Peter and his galley fleet were seen off Helsingfors, and during the summer all of southern Finland was occupied by Russian troops. The Swedish forces under general Georg Henrik Lybecker retreated inland. Before returning to Russia, Peter commanded Fyodor Apraksin, the commander of the Imperial Navy to attack the Swedish army during the winter. General Carl Gustaf Armfeldt was given command over the troops in Finland in August 1713. He faced a hopeless task; Lybecker had left him with a neglected, starving, destitute army. Reconnaissance wasn't possible because the cavalry was too worn out to carry out its duties. =The Russian army arrives at Ostrobothnia= Golitzin's army, consisting of 11 000 men, arrived at Ilmajoki in the middle of February. Armfelt decided to locate the battle to Isokyr√∂, for some pressure was applied by the Swedish regime, aided by the honour of a military officer. Most of his officers were against this decision, but Armfelt remained assured by local reserves that did not want to hand their homes and families over to Russian terror. Only six of the nearest communes or villages had time enough to send reinforcements. Armfelt had altogether 5 500 men which he at first located on both sides across from the river, in three brigades each consisting of four lines.Riviews of the Brigade of Ostrobothnia, colonel Petander, general Apraksin, professor Ville Sarkanen, etc. =The Battle is at sight= After gaining the knowledge that Golitzin's main troops had a few kilometers earlier departed to the right and were coming from the north, Armfelt relocated his troops so that the brigades of Von Freidenfelt, Von Essen, Maidell and Yxkull were on the northern side of the river. A small group with two guns occupied the hill of Napue. De La Barre's cavalry of 1 000 men, plus a group of 300 men under Ziesing, were ordered southwest from Napue to prevent Chekin's free drive along the river. Golitzin's main forces consisted of 6 500, Chekin's regiments of about 1 800 men. Before the battle Golitzin ordered three regiments of his northern troops with cossacks to veer west, aiming to amass behind the Finnish mainforces. Chekin as well separated one regiment to veer Finnish troops from the south. The battle =The Beginning of the battle= Battlefield of Storkyro The Finnish troops took the first step and started the fight with two guns on their left wing, getting an answer from the Russian artillery on their right. The Russians burnt the nearest house of Turppala, and the Finnish artillery used all the 64 shells that they had left and after one joint shooting, the infantry rushed fiercely against the Russians. The battle at close quarters was carried out with swords, bayonets and spears, and soon there were so many killed and wounded men that it was difficult to get over them and carry on the attack. The Finnish troops, especially the brigades of Maidell and Yxkull near the house of Turppala were very lucky and pushed the Russians backwards so that Armfelt thought that the battle could end up in victory.The History of Southern Ostrobothnia IV, Napue; military reviews of the Brigade of Ostrobothnia, colonel Petander etc. =A Change of luck= But at this stage the over 2,000 Russians that were sent to veer the Finns from the west appeared at the back of the Finns, who had no reserves to call for help. It was three o‚Äôclock in the afternoon. Only a half of Freidenfelt's and Essen's men were left, 1,300 Finns were fighting for their lives against 3,000 Russians. Ziesing's small group in the south was beaten as well as Taube's group at Napue. It is more than likely that General De La Barre's 1,000 men fled without taking real part in the battle. That is also the opinion of the local vicar Nils Aejmelaeus who was viewing the battle at a close distance - maybe on the so-called Rock of Kaam near the monument, on the other side of the road. As Aejmelaeus himself arrived to V√∂yri, De La Barre's cavalry was already there. Now there was a clear way for Tsekin's troops to attack at the rear of the rest of Finns. Soon almost all the Finns were surrounded, and Armfelt commanded Maidell and Yxkull to withdraw, which in that state was more easily said than done. Almost all the commanders were killed. Von Essen fought with his sword up to his end having 32 wounds in his body. 82 per cent of his regiment was lost. The battle field was filled with dead and wounded men. The rest were trying to flee to the rocky hill behind the present monument, and from there towards Laihia. Very few of the local reserves were lucky enough to survive. Armfelt himself had to fight his way towards Laihia.Military and local parish records Aftermath =The Sad end of the battle= This bloody battle had lasted a little over two hours. Concrete signs of it were seen on the field for over two hundred years. At Napue, on an area of about four hectares there were 17 graves in the middle of the 18th century. And in the beginning of the 20th century there were still open piles of human bones. The Finnish army lost over 3,000 men, 2,645 of whom were killed. Only 512 were taken prisoner, but most of them were killed on the way to the Russian ships or died in the terrible conditions of Saint Petersburg. The Russians lost, according to their own announcement, about 1,478 men. According to a Russian scholar, Aradir, the figure was over 2,000. Isokyr√∂ lost 45 percent, Laihia 60 percent, and V√§h√§kyr√∂ 70 percent of their male population. The figures from Ylistaro are not known exactly, but they must have been about 50 percent. =The terrible sufferings of the civil population= In the \\"mental atmosphere\\" after the Second World War, the traditional narratives were often considered exaggerated. According to latest researches the situation seems to have been even worse. Many scholars (Vilkuna, Keski-Sarja, Ylikangas) are talking about genocide or holocaust. The human losses did not end at this, for after the battle the situation turned to hell for the civil population. The Russian soldiers were allowed to \\"do whatever they wanted to\\". Almost all the women were raped, people were killed and tortured for no reason, houses were burnt, and robbing of possessions and cattle was widespread. The command on Peter the Great was not to occupy but to make the region impossible for living. In that sense, a huge number of young children were captured and taken as slaves to Russia. Just a few percent of them managed to come back home. People fled to distant cottages or saunas that were earlier built for tar burner workers. At least fifteen stone bases are still to be found in the woods of Isokyr√∂. So it is no wonder that people in this area have for a long time had some doubts and mistrust concerning Russians. The saying: \\"A Russian is a Russian even if fried in butter\\", was based on these terrible collective memories.Kustaa Vilkuna: Paholaisen sota 2006; Vilkuna, Ylikangas Sarkamo reviews in Isokyr√∂ 2014. A contemporary Swedish historian, Jonas Nordin from the University of Stockholm stated in 2000, the Finnish part of the kingdom was not properly defended. Many of the Swedish authorities considered, as crown prince Adolf Fredrik in 1746, Finland as their storeroom and wall against Russia.Nordin, 2ooo This review of the battle is revised to respond the knowledge of today as found for example in the book \\"The Folk of Hard Tribulations\\", \\"Kovien kokemusten kansaa\\" by Kalervo Mielty in 2013, which is based on thorough investigation of all the available studies and local tradition of today.

It was their first full-length feature film, and reportedly took a decade to finance. The film stars renowned harpsichordist Gustav Leonhardt as Johann Sebastian Bach and Christiane Lang as Anna Magdalena Bach. The orchestral music was performed by Concentus Musicus and conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt. It is the first of several Straub-Huillet films to be based on works of classical music. The film was entered into the 18th Berlin International Film Festival. Though, as on all of their films, Straub and Huillet contributed to the film equally, Straub is the officially credited director.

Their work was chiefly inspired by the buildings of Wren, Archer and Gibbs.assertion made by Pevsner p 29. Thus the Bastards' architecture was retrospective and did not follow the ideals of the more austere Palladianism which by the 1730s was highly popular in England. The brothers,A third brother, Thomas, who died in 1731 (Colvin 1995, sub \\"Bastard\\"), married an heiress and settled down to sire a family, the Horlock-Bastards of Charlton Marshall (Webb 1925). the sons of Thomas Bastard (died 1720), a joiner and architect, the founder of a family firm of provincial architects in the area. However little remains today of the works of the brothers' ancestors, chiefly as the result of the 1731 fire and a previous fire in the town in 1713. Rebuilding of Blandford Plan showing the devastation of the fire of 1731. The areas shaded black are destroyed houses; those that survived are shaded yellow A fire on 4 June 1731 destroyed the greater part of Blandford. John Bastard worked as a fire assessor before and after this fire, and a book survives in Dorset History Centre in which he detailed assessments from fires at Sturminster Newton Castle (1730), Affpuddle (1741), Beaminster (1741), Puddletown (1753) and Wareham (1762). The inventory for the fire at Blandford shows the losses of everyone in the town including the Corporation of the Borough of Blandford and the church. Bastard and Co. were the largest private losers.Cox 1993 The Blandford fire, which swept away the heart of a town that had evolved in a haphazard way from the medieval period, presented an opportunity for more regular redevelopment in the classical styles. However, with the exception of a widening the original market square, the fashionable Baroque style of town planningThe Baroque form of town planning ‚Äì wide boulevards, often on a grid plan, leading to squares creating vistas, so successfully deployed in 18th century Bath, remained in vogue long after Baroque architecture had passed from fashion was ignored and the town was rebuilt on its former medieval street plan. =Town Hall= West Street, Blandford Forum The first building to be completed in Blandford was the grandiose town hall, finished in 1734.It bears the date on the frieze of the central window and BASTARD in the curved pediment above (Webb 1925:144). Constructed, like much of their work, in the local Portland stone, the building is architecturally of interest because of its idiosyncrasies of style. While at first glance appearing to be a typical example of the Palladian style popular at the time, this is not truly the case. The ground floor is an open arcade of three segmented arches more typical of Renaissance Dutch and English market halls. The upper floor however, is in the highest Palladian tradition, as exemplified by Inigo Jones in his Banqueting House at Whitehall, the windows alternating with segmental and pointed pediments. The whole of the facade is surmounted by a uniting pediment, with a circular window at its centre. The design of the facade seems incomplete, as though flanking wings are missing. The provincial design of the building is again emphasised by the placement of three covered urns on the pediment redolent of the Baroque style which by the 1730s had already passed from its brief period of high fashion in England. The pediment appears heavy and lacks support from the pilasters which more urbane architects would have placed at either end of the facade. The Town Hall, designed to provide a central feature to a row of houses, is typical of the work of the Bastard brothers, from which they were to make their fortune. They became entrepreneurs and local politicians.Blandford Forum. Other works by the Bastards in the town include the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, built between 1733 and 1739; the market place around the town hall, designed in the classical style but not uniform; the Greyhound Inn (1734‚Äì35; now a bank), which was their own property; a terrace of almshouses; and many large private houses with classical facades, notably Spetisbury and Coupar House. =Church of St Peter and St Paul= The parish church of St Peter and St Paul was built between 1732 and 1739 and is a classical building with a cupola on top of the tower. Outside of London, it is one of the few Georgian churches in the country. The design by John Bastard originally specified that the tower would have a steeple, but lack of money resulted in the wooden cupola instead, a decision that disgusted Bastard, who stated that \\"it will not keep the wett nor the weather out\\". Sir Frederick Treves was not a fan of the church's appearance, describing it in his 1906 Highways & Byways in Dorset as \\"ugly, and only tolerable from a distance\\". The interior remains relatively unaffected by Victorian interference and retains its font, pulpit, box pews and mayoral seat.Betjeman, John (ed.) (1968), Collins Pocket Guide to English Parish Churches; the South. London: Collins; p. 172 Ornate plasterwork on the ceiling of the Bastards' Study The rebuilding of the town was officially completed in 1760‚Äìa feat commemorated by a memorial in the form of a portico to the church, known as the Fire Monument. Pevsner describes this memorial as a \\"detailed tabernacle with Doric columns\\".Pevsner 1972:97 This was designed and paid for by John Bastard, who had it engraved, somewhat immodestly, with the inscription \\"in grateful Acknowledgement of the Divine Mercy, that has raised this Town, like a phoenix from its ashes, to its present beautiful and flourishing State.\\" However, the monument also has a more practical use, built above a piped spring: should a fire break out again it would supply a head of water for the attachment of fire hoses. The monument was converted into a drinking fountain in 1899.Cox 1993,8. =The Bastards' House= The Study in the Bastards' House. At the time of the 1731 fire the bachelor brothers John and William occupied a house in Blandford Forum that belonged to the Trustees of the William Williams charity. The Bastards had extensive workshops and premises at the rear of this building. After the fire they rebuilt the house at their own expense in exchange for the grant of a long lease of the premises from the Williams charity. The room known as the Bastards' Study or the Mezzanine Room was ornately decorated, unlike the rest of the house, and served as a showroom for their skills in plasterwork, woodwork and interior decoration. The pediment of the overmantel is Palladian while the pediment of the door opposite is Baroque, this occurrence, coupled with the squat appearance of the composition, would not have occurred in the work of a major architect of the time, but was the Bastard's way of showcasing their versatility. This room is open to visit as it is now the vintage room of a charity shop.  Other works  A door casement in the Study of the Bastards' House. The broken pediment is a motif of the Baroque period. The door panels contain different motifs demonstrating available styles Charlton Marshall, parish church of St. Mary The Bastard brothers' work in the no longer fashionable Baroque seems to have been through preference rather than ignorance. When working on formal civic buildings they invariably attempted to design in the more modern Palladian style, Blandford's town hall exemplifies this. However, when given the freedom of choice over design then they appear to follow the more flowing and curvaceous Baroque.This theory is expounded by Pevsner p 51 John Bastard's own house, and the \\"Red Lion\\" public house both in Blandford are both in the Baroque style, with broken pediments and capitals inspired by those of Borromini rather than those of Palladio. The lack of accurate record keeping at the time has necessitated in many cases attribution to the brothers rather than complete credit. Outside Blandford, the Bastards were responsible for joiner's and carver's work in Hazlegrove House, Somerset and at Lulworth Castle, Dorset (destroyed by fire in 1929). John Bastard was employed, with the master-mason Francis Cartwright, to rebuild Crichel House, Dorset, for Sir William Napier. The church of St. Mary at Charlton Marshall is attributed the brothers.Pevsner 141‚Äì142 The church which was built in 1713 has a distinctive tower topped by four obelisk pinnacles. Charlton Marshall was the home of the Horlock-Bastard family, where they had been country gentlemen since the time of the brother' s grandfather Thomas Bastard.Burlington Magazine Thus the interior of the church contains memorials to members of the Bastard family, including a sculpture dedicated Thomas Bastard who died in 1791 which depicts a putto standing by an urn. The early 18th century nave of the Church of St Mary at Almer in Dorset is attributed to them as Stepleton House at Iwerne Stepleton, and the church of St. Giles in Wimborne St Giles was rebuilt by the brothers in 1732. Sir Peter Thompson House in Poole, with crowded fenestration. In Poole, a Grade I listed mansion house built in 1746 for the wealthy 18th century merchant Sir Peter Thompson, is attributed to John Bastard. This three storied brick and stuccoed house designed on an \\"H\\" plan is designed in a confused Palladian style, the fenestration making the facade crowded. It is now used as offices by private businesses. John Bastard rebuilt Crichel House for Sir William Napier after a fire in 1742,John Cornforth notes payments, starting in 1744, also to Francis Crickford of Blandford. (Cornforth, \\"The Building of Crichel\\" Architectural History 27, Design and Practice in British Architecture: Studies in Architectural History Presented to Howard Colvin [1984], pp. 268‚Äì269). and the brothers' nephews and heirs, Thomas,In the younger generation there were two Thomases, \\"the elder\\" (1720‚Äì1771), son of Samuel, and \\"the younger\\" (1724‚Äì1791), son of Thomas (died 1731). (Cornforth : Benjamin and James, collaborated to enlarge the shell of Crichel House in 1771‚Äì73; the new interiors were designed by James Wyatt.Cornforth noted payments to Wyatt 1772‚Äì80. There is a wall monument with a pediment to Benjamin and Thomas Bastard, dated 1772, on the external face of the north wall of the parish church of St Mary Magdalene, Castleton, Sherborne in Dorset. The inscription has weathered away. Inside the nave, on the north wall of the north aisle is a monument to Elizabeth Bastard (n√©e Prankerd), wife of Benjamin Bastard, 1732-3, and their son Benjamin. This is a marble wall monument with side-scrolls, pediment, urn and cherub's head.RCHME 1952:211 Other members of the Bastard family were masons in Dorset and as far afield as London and the Dashwood mausoleum at West Wycombe. There are no records of any member of the Bastard family practising as architects after the first quarter of the 19th centuryWebb 1925.  Evaluation  Although the brothers' work is in a provincial style, critics have evaluated it positively. Pevsner describes the Bastards' works at Blandford as providing \\"One of the most satisfying Georgian ensembles anywhere in England\\".Pevsner. p 95 Such architectural naivety as can be found in some of the Bastards' works is visible in small country towns the length and breadth of Britain and exemplifies the spread of evolving architectural genres from the cities.For a brief survey of the practice of architecture in the eighteenth century, see Howard Colvin's preface to A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600‚Äì1840, 3rd ed.

It was remade simultaneously in 1995 in Tamil and Telugu as Kuruthipunal and Drohi , produced by Kamal Haasan and directed by P. C. Sreeram, which was India's official entry for the 68th Academy Awards Best Foreign Language Film category. Plot Indian cities are being terrorized by a group of people who want the government to give in to their demands and are willing to go to any extent for that purpose. Honest, experienced and diligent cops Abhay Singh (Om Puri) and Abbas Lodhi (Naseeruddin Shah) are part of the anti-terrorism task force set up by the government to eliminate the menace. Abbas Lodhi comes up with the idea of \\"Operation Dhanush\\", which involves sending two undercover cops, Anand (Manoj Bajpai) and Shiv (Milind Gunaji) among the terrorist group, so that they shall be part of them and learn all about them, and can call him through radio and transmit all the information under the code name Dhanush. Only Abbas and Abhay know about this operation. Anand, one of the undercover cops, is exposed by the terrorists a few years later. However, he dies by consuming cyanide before they can get any information from him. Now Shiv is left alone in the gang. He soon wins the trust and respect of everyone in the gang, including the mastermind Commander Bhadra (Ashish Vidyarthi) himself. Bhadra is captured and tortured by the police. But try as they may, he does not reveal anything to Abbas or Abhay. When Bhadra is in jail, the gang appoints one of their sharpshooters to kill a minister as he is approaching the city in his car, which he does successfully. This man is apprehended and interrogated by Abhay. He agrees to help the police for the safety of his family, but soon is poisoned in jail itself by a corrupt cop, Inspector Tiwari (Shrivallabh Vyas). Soon one of Abhay and Lodhi's trusted and highly respected officers, and good friends, IGP Pathak (Amrish Puri), commits suicide when the CBI come to arrest him on charges of being linked with the terrorists. This comes as a rude shock for Abhay and Lodhi. They now realize that there are people all over who seem to be linked with the terrorists. Now Bhadra offers Abhay the chance to join with and help the terrorists, or else his family will be in danger. Abhay does not oblige. The terrorists shoot the family dog, killing it, shoot at Abhay's son's leg and injure him, and send messages directly and indirectly to threaten him. Abhay finally agrees. Bhadra asks for Abhay to sham a fake kidnap drama and allow him to escape, which he unwillingly does. Lodhi is shocked at Bhadra's escape, but he does not understand why Abhay is acting strangely. Now outside, Bhadra soon send two people, Surinder (Annu Kapoor) and Mala to stay in Abhay's house, and asks the latter to accommodate them. The two of them keep Bhadra informed about everything, and threaten to kill Abhay's wife and child if he were to try anything funny at any time. Only Abhay knows about their true identity. Soon Bhadra meets Abhay, and under threat of his wife and child being killed by Bhadra's signaling to the couple at their house, Abhay reveals that it was Lodhi who had arranged for two undercover cops to be sent to the gang, and only he knows 'who' Dhanush really is. Abhay also comes to know that Inspector Tiwari, who was supporting Bhadra, has been eliminated. The gang attacks Lodhi. He almost starts to finish them off, when he sees that one of the people sent to capture him is Shiv, so he goes along with them. Lodhi is beaten, but he does not reveal who the inside man is. Soon he is killed accidentally by Bhadra's pistol. The shock of all that is happening is too much for Abhay to bear. He tells everything to Sumitra (Mita Vashisht), who tells Abhay that as a Police officer, he had taken an oath to protect the nation, and he must go by that. She also says that she will take care of everyone and everything if he were not there. Consoled, Abhay is then called for a late night meeting by Bhadra again. When he leaves for Lodhi's house first, Surinder tries to attack and rape a girl being taken care of by Abhay and his wife. At this point, Mala orders Surinder at gunpoint to leave the girl, but Surinder shoots Mala. Sumitra sees all this, and in order to save him, seduces Surinder. Once in the bedroom, she pushes Surinder off, and kills him with her own gun. Abhay Singh is informed and he returns home, and consoles his family and bids them goodbye. He goes to meet Bhadra, where he attacks the criminal and is overpowered and bound to a chair. With only Shiv in the room, Commander Bhadra asks Abhay about the inside man, and suddenly points the pistol at Shiv. Abhay jumps off, attacks Bhadra, breaks free and stabs him in the neck with the broken wood of the chair. On hearing the commotion, as the entire gang comes from outside to break into the room, Abhay tells Shiv to shoot him, because then it will appear as though Abhay was killed when he attacked Bhadra, and Shiv being highly trusted, would become the new gang leader. A reluctant Shiv does so, just as the gang breaks in. Shiv declares himself to be the terrorist gang leader, and the others accept his leadership. Abhay Singh passes away in peace.

The firm concentrated on publishing compositions by so-called Indianist movement members--composers who incorporated traditional Native American music into their works. Although it never achieved its founder's intentions of fomenting a classical musical revolution in the United States, the company saw success during its eleven- year history before being acquired and abandoned by G. Schirmer in 1912. History Farwell was inspired by Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k's embracing of folk music; during Dvo≈ô√°k's 1890s stint at the National Conservatory of Music, the Czech called for American composers to develop a uniquely American style of classical music.Daniels, Valerie (June 2002). \\"Selling the North American Indian: The Work of Edward Curtis: A Vanishing Race\\". Retrieved on March 6, 2007. During Farwell's own brief foray into academia at Cornell University (1899-1901), he started composing short pieces based on Native American melodies. After leaving Cornell and settling in Newton Center, he fleshed out a compilation of American Indian Melodies. His search for a publisher of the work was unsuccessful, and, as a result, he founded Wa-Wan Press in 1901.The Library of Congress (February 1, 2007). \\"Biography: Arthur Farwell, 1872-1952: The Library of Congress Presents: Music, Theater and Dance\\".

American Music, Vol. 5, No. 2. pp. 156-175. The press was launched without financial backing, and operated out of the Farwell family home; its only employees were Farwell and his father, George. Its first issue in 1901 contained Farwell's American Indian Melodies and two works by Edgar Stillman Kelley. Farwell hoped that the creation of the Wa-Wan Press would hail the beginning of a classical music revolution that would rebel against what he deemed a \\"German domination\\" of the nation's music. The American public, he believed, \\"saw everything through German glasses\\", and, \\"a revolt against this domination was an absolute historical necessity\\". For the first five years, the Wa-Wan Press published two books per quarter--one vocal and one instrumental--at an annual subscription rate of eight dollars. Subscriptions continued to grow, and in 1907, the company began printing monthly.Marroco, W. Thomas and Jacobs, Mark. \\"Wa-Wan Press\\". Grove Music Online (subscription required). ed. L. Macy. Retrieved on March 5, 2007. That same year, Farwell founded the Wa-Wan Society for the \\"advancement of the work of American composers, and the interests of the musical life of the American people.\\" The Wa-Wan Press later began publishing compositions in sheet music form. Farwell provided introductions, program notes, and essays to accompany the aesthetic volumes, whose covers and typographical innovations were often designed by himself. Farwell took particular pride in his work, noting later that many publishers adapted his ideas. In 1908, the firm started losing subscriptions and ran into financial troubles. By 1912, Farwell's enthusiasm for the press had waned, and he had become chief Boston-area music critic for Musical America. He agreed to the take-over of Wa-Wan Press by G. Schirmer, which soon abandoned the project.\\"IHAS: Composer: ARTHUR FARWELL\\". PBS. Retrieved on March 6, 2007. During its 11-year history, the press had published 37 composers (nine of whom were women), including Carlos Troyer, Rubin Goldmark, and Henry F. Gilbert.

Changing its name to the National Alliance for Optional Parenthood, it continued into the early 1980s both as a support group for those making the decision to be childfree and an advocacy group fighting pronatalism (attitudes/advertising/etc. promoting or glorifying parenthood).

Music was not his primary activity until his accidental \\"discovery\\" by the folklorist Chuck Perdue in the 1960s. Jackson had effectively given up playing in his community in 1949. Life and career John H Jackson was born into a musical family in Woodville, Virginia, and learned to play the guitar at an early age. He moved to Fairfax, Virginia, in his twenties, where he worked as a gravedigger, among other jobs. His first recordings were released in the early 1960s by Arhoolie Records. He visited Europe several times, played at folk music festivals, and also recorded for Rounder Records and Alligator Records. He also appeared around Washington, D.C., with the Travelling Blues Workshop, which included Jackson, Archie Edwards, Flora Molton, Mother Scott, and Phil Wiggins and John Cephas. Jackson died in 2002 of liver cancer in Fairfax Station, Virginia, at the age of 77. Jackson and his wife, Cora Lee Carter Jackson, had six boys and one girl. He was preceded in death by Cora Lee (1990) and by their sons John Jackson Jr. (1978), Ned Jackson (1978), and MacArthur Jackson (1996). Two of his remaining sons died after him: Lee Floyd Jackson (2006) and Timothy Jackson (2008).

The film features prominently architecture, flora and costuming (including a policeman in a bobby helmet) that is unlikely to be found in the United States. Only a handful of shots were shot on location in the United States, including the Statue of Liberty and the Missouri River. Though Huillet and Straub are both French, the film was shot in German, the book's original language. The film was shot on black-and-white 35mm Kodak film stock by French cinematographer William Lubtchansky. Like all other Straub-Huillet films, it only uses location sound recorded at the same time as the image, emphasizing cinema's documentary nature over the pictorial.

It sees the etymology and the change in meaning of terms as forming a crucial basis for contemporary cultural, conceptual and linguistic understanding. Conceptual history deals with the evolution of paradigmatic ideas and value systems over time, such as \\"liberty\\" or \\"reform\\". It argues that social history ‚Äì indeed all historical reflection ‚Äì must begin with an understanding of historically contingent cultural values and practices in their particular contexts over time, not merely as unchanging ideologies or processes. Interest in conceptual history was given a particular boost in the 20th century through the publication of the Historisches W√∂rterbuch der Philosophie, the Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe, and the journal Archiv f√ºr Begriffsgeschichte. Conceptual history is an interdisciplinary methodology. Alongside the philosopher Joachim Ritter, the historians Otto Brunner and Reinhart Koselleck, and the sociologist Erich Rothacker are viewed as its pioneers in the German-speaking world and internationally. Raymond Williams was the leading scholar in the English-speaking world. Today, conceptual history is promoted by the History of Concepts Group and its peer- reviewed journal Contributions to the History of Concepts under the lead of Margrit Pernau, Jan Ifversen, and Jani Marjanen.

Biography  =Upbringing= Brinsmead's parents, Edward Kenelm Guy Hungerford and May Lambert, were missionaries for the Seventh-day Adventist Church who left Sydney for Java (Indonesia) 1909 to 1912. On their return her father and his brothers built homes in the isolated area of the Blue Mountains where Brinsmead was born. Ken and May took their three small children, one of whom was seriously ill, with them. They farmed in this beautiful place while the children grew up. Brinsmead was the youngest and, for several years, was the only child at home as her siblings were at school in town. =The writer= Brinsmead was determined to be a writer from an early age but had very little formal education due to her home's remote location. Her mother gave her much of her early education at home around their kitchen table. After completing some primary schooling by correspondence she attended a small church high school at Wahroonga, Sydney. Eventually she left home in her mid-teens and became a teacher. She taught in various places around Australia, at a one-teacher school, as a governess in the far west of NSW and in the Derwent Valley of Tasmania. She undertook a correspondence course in journalism whilst in her thirties. She had married Reg Brinsmead when 20 years of age and had two sons. Her husband owned and managed a pest control business active in three states. Finding time to write or study was a struggle for Brinsmead as she was always kept busy with clerical tasks and arranging employees' food and accommodation needs. She managed to escape in various ways to find a place to write undisturbed; to a caravan in the back yard or to coffee shops. Whilst living in Melbourne, the ANZ bank near her home in the suburb of Nunawading allowed her to use a spare room on their premises. During her life she resided for varying lengths of time in North Queensland, Melbourne, Tasmania, the West Australian outback, and in northern New South Wales. These places are all featured strongly in her novels. =Influences and inspiration= Her novels, taken from her experiences and travels around Australia, were written for children and young adults; however, they expressed many themes that have gained more prominence in today's world ‚Äì such as the fragility and beauty of the environment and indigenous areas and the need for their conservation, the effect of ecological damage, the plight of refugees and societies disaffected and the human cost of resource development. As examples, Echo in the Wilderness, set on Lake Pedder on the eve of its destruction, chronicles the submergence and obliteration of the lake. Her 1983 book, I Will Not Say the Day Is Done (her only non-fiction/adult book) brought to life the struggle to save Lake Pedder. She was passionately consumed by the need to do something about environmental vandalism in Tasmania. Her book Isle of the Sea Horse, released in 1969, grew out of her concern about the ecological devastation to the Great Barrier Reef and, among other concerns, the plight of refugees. Her Longtime trilogy was set in, and inspired by her upbringing in, the Blue Mountains. =Recognition and later life= She was friends with fellow well known children's writers Nance Donkin and Lu Rees and, later, provided advice and support to younger writer Nette Hilton, after she moved to Northern New South Wales in 1976. Brinsmead was twice the winner of the Children's Book Council of Australia's Book of the Year Award (for Pastures of the Blue Crane in 1965 and Longtime Passing in 1972), and winner of the Dame Mary Gilmore Medallion in 1965. Pastures of the Blue Crane was later made into a successful mini-series by ABC TV. Her fame from writing books allowed her to forge a separate but related career as a public speaker, speaking at conferences, seminars, meetings, school and public library events. Many of her over twenty books reached an international readership and were translated into Japanese, Italian, Czech, and German as well as being published in British, American and Australian editions. In later life she retired to Terranora in northern NSW but even in her later years was an outspoken opponent of developers taking over the land. She stopped writing in the 1990s due to ill health. She had suffered from osteoporosis all her life.

It was launched by the Chinese Academy of Social Science (CASS) and received financial support from both the Chinese government and the CASS. The stated purpose of the Northeast Project was to use authoritative academic research to restore historical facts and protect the stability of Northeast China‚Äîa region sometimes known as Manchuria‚Äîin the context of the strategic changes that have taken place in Northeast Asia since China's \\"Reform and Opening\\" started in 1978.. Two of the project's leaders accused some foreign scholars and institutions of rewriting history to demand territory from China or to promote instability in the frontier regions, hence the necessity of the Project., citing two of the Northeast Project's programmatic statements. The Project has been criticized for applying the contemporary vision of China as a \\"unified multiethnic state\\" to ancient ethnic groups, states and history of the region of Manchuria and northern Korea.; . According to this idea, there was a greater Chinese state in the ancient past. Accordingly, any pre-modern people or state that occupied any part of what is now the People's Republic of China is defined as having been part of Chinese history.. Similar projects have been conducted on Tibet and Xinjiang, which have been named Southwest Project and Northwest Project, respectively. Due to its claims on Gojoseon, Goguryeo and Balhae, the project sparked disputes with Korea. In 2004, this dispute threatened to lead to diplomatic disputes between the People's Republic of China and South Korea, although all governments involved seem to exhibit no desire to see the issue damage relations. Organization The Northeast Project was approved in 2001.. Its first organizational meeting was held in Changchun (Jilin province) in June 2001 between representatives of the Chinese Academy of Social Science (CASS) and delegates from the Politburo of the Communist Party of Jilin Province, but the five-year project officially began in February 2002.; . The \\"Second Academic Conference on the History and Current State of the Northeast and on Gaogouli\\" (Á¨¨‰∫åÂ±ä‰∏úÂåóËæπÁñÜÂéÜÂè≤‰∏éÁé∞Áä∂Êö®È´òÂè•‰∏ΩÂ≠¶ÊúØÁ†îËÆ®‰ºö) was held in Changchun in July 2002, organized by the \\"Research Center for Chinese Borderland History and Geography\\" (‰∏≠ÂõΩËæπÁñÜÂè≤Âú∞Á†îÁ©∂‰∏≠ÂøÉ; part of the CASS) and the Jilin Academy of Social Sciences, and supported by ten more academic institutions from the Northeast Chinese provinces of Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Liaoning.. Various figures have been cited for the Project's budget. One document issued by the \\"Northeast Project expert committee\\" (‰∏ìÂÆ∂ÂßîÂëò‰ºö) on 28 February 2002 earmarked funds of 15 million yuan (2.4 million US dollars) for the project, planning to use 2.5 million yuan per year.\\"Management Methods of Expenditures for the 'Northeast Project'\\" ‚Äú‰∏úÂåóËæπÁñÜÂéÜÂè≤‰∏éÁé∞Áä∂Á≥ªÂàóÁ†îÁ©∂Â∑•Á®ã‚ÄùÁªèË¥πÁÆ°ÁêÜÂäûÊ≥ï ; Research Center for Chinese Borderland History and Geography ‰∏≠ÂõΩËæπÁñÜÂè≤Âú∞Á†îÁ©∂‰∏≠ÂøÉ (retrieved on 11 January 2013). The funding was to come from three sources: the Chinese Ministry of Finance, the CASS itself, and the provincial committee of the Communist Party of Jilin, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang. Two articles unrelated to the Northeast Project claim that the Project had a budget of \\"an astounding 20 billion yuan\\" (3.21 billion US dollars), or about \\"three trillion Korean won.\\"3 trillion won: . 20 billion yuan: \\"What China's Northeast Project Is All About\\", Chosun Ilbo (retrieved on 11 January 2013). Background In 1982 the PRC constitution was amended to redefine the People's Republic of China as a \\"unitary multinational state built up jointly by the people of all its nationalities\\" (‰∏≠Âçé‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂíåÂõΩÊòØÂÖ®ÂõΩÂêÑÊóè‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂêåÁºîÈÄ†ÁöÑÁªü‰∏ÄÁöÑÂ§öÊ∞ëÊóèÂõΩÂÆ∂)., citing from the PRC Constitution. Inspired by such concepts, in the 1990s some Chinese historians such as Sun Jinji Â≠´ÈÄ≤Â∑± and Zhang Boquan ÂºµÂçöÊ≥â began to re-identify Goguryeo, especially the first half of Goguryeo's history before it moved its capital to the Korean peninsula, as part of the history of China rather than Korea.. As early as 1993, the leader of a North Korean delegation attending a historical conference on Goguryeo in China accused Chinese historians of understanding ancient China as coterminous with the PRC, a view he claimed was not backed up by historical evidence.. In 2002, the PRC government took the North Korea delegation leader's challenge and initiated the Northeast Project. China asserted that Goguryeo was an ethnic Tungusic state; and in modern-day China, Tungusic ethnicities like Manchus are citizens of China and viewed as part of China's multi-ethnic historical civilization. The Northeast Project is part of a series of historical research projects conducted by the Chinese Academy of Social Science, preceded by the Origin of Chinese Civilization Project () and Xia‚ÄìShang‚ÄìZhou Chronology Project.. These projects and other subsequent ones such as the Northeast Project are based on the modern idea of Zhonghua Minzu or a \\"unified multi-ethnic state\\", which conceives ancient China in terms of the territorial bounds of the modern Chinese state.; ; . This has led to numerous historical research projects by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences on areas near the Chinese border, where historical territory overlaps with contemporary neighbors. This includes Manchuria and the Korean peninsula, which comprise the contemporary territories of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, and the Russian Federation (Siberia). The Northeast Project consists of research on historical kingdoms, polities and ethnicities in this area, and also modern issues such as territorial disputes and immigration.. Pre-modern historical kingdoms and polities covered in the Northeast Project are in chronological order: Gojoseon, Buyeo, Goguryeo, Baekjae, Balhae, Yuan Dynasty, Ming Dynasty, Joseon and Qing Dynasty. Modern historical and contemporary states covered by the Northeast Project are the Empire of Japan, the Soviet Union, South and North Korea and the PRC. Research in the Northeast Project has claimed Gojoseon, Bueyo, Goguryeo and Balhae as regional governments of the ancient Chinese empire. This contrasts with other historiography, where these kingdoms are considered to be sovereign independent states in Korean history. Reactions The Northeast Project's claims on ancient kingdoms that most Koreans consider as part of their own history began to receive wide press coverage in South Korea in 2004, which led to public outrage. The Northeast Project has also received strong criticism from academic experts from South Korea and many other countries China shock for South Korea By Bruce Klingner. Asia Times including China itself. Controversy mainly focused on Goguryeo, which continues to play a central role in Korean nationalism.. The Northeast Project's appropriation of Goguryeo has become a turning point in public perception of China in South Korea and also affected strategic and diplomatic relations between the two countries.. In South Korea, the Northeast Project has come to symbolize China's historical revisionism and radical political expansionism and continues to be mentioned even well after the Project was officially concluded in 2007. However, there are lingering doubts as to whether the Northeast Project is truly finished. According to some Korean scholars, the termination of the Northeast Project is still debatable. *Local governments of the Dungbei region are still carrying out the project‚Äôs legacy with the central government‚Äôs approval, with signs and pamphlets in many tourist sites that introduce Goguryeo as a local government of a Chinese minority group. *2001-2008 Origin of Chinese Civilization Project (Chinese: ‰∏≠ËèØÊñáÊòéÊé¢Ê∫êÂ∑•Á®ã) is also argued to be a continuation the Northeast Project, attempting to define the Liao River civilization as the roots of Chinese ancient civilization, instead of well-known the Yellow River civilization. It is deemed controversial as the Liao River civilization include the representative Hongshan Culture (Chinese: Á∫¢Â±±ÊñáÂåñ). The Chinese historians have first regarded the Hongshan Culture to be related with Balhae and other Korean cultures, but this project‚Äôs attempts at including the Hongshan Culture as the source of Chinese ancient history sparked debate with the Korean claims and its sources based on Gojoseon. *Chinese history education that changed after 2001 History Curriculum Standards, a governmental policy overseeing Chinese history education, have drastically reduced discussion regarding history in the Korean peninsula. Korean scholars make note of the fact that, under the policy of History Program that precede the 2001 History Curriculum Standards, books included historical record that the Sui dynasty invasion of Goguryeo ended in failure and has contributed to the downfall of the Sui dynasty, but now has been deleted. Balhae has also been recorded as one of the local governments of the Tang dynasty, which remains a controversial topic in the Northeast Asian academia. *The Chinese government‚Äôs attempts at extending the total length of Great Wall of China, including the Balhae and Goguryeo castle walls, are also interpreted as a continuation of the Northeast Project. While Shanhaiguan (Chinese: Â±±Êµ∑Èóú) were confirmed as the east end of the Great Wall before the project, the extension to Heilongjiang (Chinese: ÈªëÈæçÊ±üÁúÅ) included Goguryeo and Balhae‚Äôs territory, which became another source of controversy. The Great Wall of China had been extended again in 2012, exceeding almost twice the original length of the Great Wall. Korean scholars have strongly protested against the repeated alteration of historical details published by the Chinese government. Korean scholars also protest that historical artifacts chiefly in Goguryeo and Balhae territory are being destroyed. Legacy After the Northeast Project came under strong criticism in 2004, key members of the Northeast Project, along with other academics in Northeast China, founded the journal History and Geography of Northeast China (), published by the Jilin Academy of Social Sciences. The journal continued most research formerly conducted by the Northeast Project, and further expanded its research scope to include the historical kingdoms and polities of Lelang Commandery and Silla, both located in the Korean peninsula.

Location  View over Newport from Brynglas Drive Brynglas is situated above the M4 motorway in Newport and famous on traffic reports of congestion at the Brynglas Tunnels.  Amenities & history  Brynglas is well known for its great views overlooking the city of Newport. Brynglas today has a population of about 300 inhabitants and contains a primary school and Brynglas House. The name is from the Welsh language for \\"Blue Hill\\". Locals speculate that the reasoning for this name is due to the thousands of Common bluebells that appear each spring in the Brynglas Bluebell woods. Prior to development the south-facing hill would have appeared blue during the spring around April and May and therefore was called 'Brynglas'. The area consists of the streets of Brynglas Drive, Brynglas Road, Brynglas Close, Brynglas Court, Brynglas Crescent and the relatively modern Bryn-Bevan estate. Local landmarks *Brynglas House *Crindau House (Oldest house in Newport) *Brynglas Primary School *Newport Lodge Hotel *Brynglas Tunnels Brynglas Road was the first road to be built in the Brynglas area. The houses were privately owned. The road originally led solely to Brynglas House on top of the hill. Later on, a council estate, Brynglas Drive was added. Brynglas Drive consists mostly of quickly built post-war concrete-structured housing and were originally built and owned by Newport Corporation. Most of the housing has now been bought privately but Newport City Council still own some. Brynglas Court and Brynglas Close consist of council-style flats. Bryn Bevan, off Brynglas Road, is the latest addition to the Brynglas area. The simple-styled housing was very cost- effective and has great views overlooking the city. Brynglas Tunnels The eastern portal. The Brynglas Tunnels carry the M4 motorway under Brynglas Hill in Newport.Bryn Glas Tunnels M4 (Western Portal):: OS grid ST3089 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square! The 1,200 ft-long twin- bored tunnels were the first tunnels in the British motorway network and are still the only bored tunnels using tunnel boring machines. The tunnels and adjacent Usk bridge were originally planned by Newport Corporation in August 1959 in a plan submitted to the Ministry of Transport. Work started on 10 September 1962 and both structures were complete and open to traffic by 1967. Almost as soon as the M4 Newport bypass (junctions 24-28) had opened, the traffic levels had grown to such a degree that the road had to be widened to three lanes in each direction. This was finished in 1982 but with the exception of the tunnels and Usk bridge which remained as dual two-lane sections. During the original construction several houses on Brynglas Road (where the modern Newport Lodge Hotel now stands) had to be demolished due to structural weaknesses caused by the tunnelling. Therefore the technical challenges and risk associated with widening the existing tunnels in a highly built-up area were found to be too great. The tunnels remain a bottleneck on the motorway and as of 2011 a new bypass south of the city has been proposed, the M4 relief road. Brynglas House Currently is the Training department for Newport Social Services owned by Newport City Council, however it has had many uses in the past such as being used as a hospital during World War II and a secondary school through the 1960s and early 1970s And an Adult Education Centre until 2014.

It originated in 1995 with the novel Sabriel and has continued in the novels Lirael (2001) and Abhorsen (2003). The series has continued with the prequel novel Clariel (2014), and the latest installment of the series, Goldenhand, was released in October 2016. The Old Kingdom also consists of the novella The Creature in the Case (2005) and other short fiction. In Australia an omnibus edition comprising three novels and one novella was titled The Old Kingdom Chronicles. Omnibus editions in the U.S. have been titled The Abhorsen Trilogy (2003) and The Abhorsen Chronicles (2009). ISFDB catalogues the entire continuing series as \\"The Old Kingdom / Abhorsen\\". Books in the series =Sabriel= The protagonist, Sabriel, is in her final few days at her school in Ancelstierre (an alternate history of 1910s England), when she is visited by a spirit summoned by her father (the Abhorsen), who is trapped in Death and departs to rescue him. Accompanied by her father's assistant Mogget, she discovers Touchstone; and with him continues to Belisaere (the capital of the Old Kingdom). In a sacred site under the city, Sabriel briefly frees her father, who diverts the antagonist Kerrigor while the others escape. Sabriel and Touchstone then travel to Ancelstierre to destroy Kerrigor's body, which the local soldiery (at their behest) convey to Wyverly College, Sabriel's school. Kerrigor and his undead followers besiege the college, killing many students and guardsmen; whereupon Mogget, in his true form, fights Kerrigor for the right to kill Sabriel. Kerrigor consumes Mogget and throws Sabriel onto her sword; whereupon she throws Mogget's binding ring over Kerrigor. This creates two cats: a black Kerrigor and white Mogget, which are then bound by Ranna. Sabriel then dies, but is resurrected by her ancestors to succeed her father as the Old Kingdom's protector. =Lirael= The protagonist, Lirael, is raised among the Clayr; but having coal-black hair, a pale complexion, and brown eyes, differs physically from her chestnut-skinned, white-blonde, blue or green-eyed peers, and additionally lacks their native precognition. While trying to make a canine sending, she accidentally summons the immortal 'Disreputable Dog', thereafter her constant companion. In Ancelestierre, Prince Sameth (the son of Sabriel and Touchstone) is attacked by the necromancer Hedge and his summoned Dead Hands (a zombie-like construct); and Sameth's friend Nicholas 'Nick' Sayre is placed under Hedge's control. Sameth's father, Touchstone, thereafter conveys him to their capital Belisaere. Here he is expected to succeed his mother as the Abhorsen, a future of which he is terrified. Concurrently, Nick Sayre crosses the border into the Old Kingdom and continues to the Red Lake: a region in the south-west of the Kingdom where neither the royal rule nor the Clayr's 'Sight' has influence. Upon news thereof, Sameth goes in search of him, and is later joined by Mogget. Meanwhile, Lirael inherits the artifacts of a Remembrancer (a clairvoyant able to view the past) and is swiftly dispatched to fulfill a very recent vision of herself and Nick Sayre upon the Red Lake. She is joined by Sameth and Mogget en route. All are attacked repeatedly and nearly overcome by Chlorr of the Mask; but they reach the Abhorsens' House, where Lirael is identified as Sabriel's half-sister and heir, and Sameth as successor to the previously extinct 'Wallmakers'. =Abhorsen= The Abhorsen's House is besieged by Dead Hands led by Chlorr of the Mask (an undead sorceress) under the control of the necromancer Hedge. Hedge himself serves Orannis the Destroyer, an immortal imprisoned millennia prior by 7 of its 8 cohorts and now desirous to destroy the biosphere. The protagonists escape the siege through a well-like opening, in whose adjoined tunnel they encounter the spirit 'Astarael' (the originator of the Abhorsens' power). Meanwhile, Prince Sameth's parents, the Abhorsen Sabriel and King Touchstone, are in Ancelstierre to stop the genocide of refugees; but are nearly themselves killed by rebels and return to the Old Kingdom. Thereafter descendants of each of the powers that originally created the Charter unite at the two nations' dividing Wall (a fictionalized Hadrian's Wall) to re-enact the imprisonment of Orannis; and having done so, Lirael's 'Disreputable Dog' (a self-identified remnant of the spirit 'Kibeth') revives the dead Nicholas Sayre and departs into the border dividing Life from Death. =Clariel= Clariel, a prequel to the original three books of the series, is set some six hundred years before the events of Sabriel, in an Old Kingdom ruled by an absent King, Orrikan, who refuses to rule, or abdicate to someone who will, until his granddaughter returns to take the crown. In his place, the mercantile Guilds have taken power, led by the powerful Kilp, the Guildmaster of the Goldsmiths, who rules as governor in Belisaere. Clariel is the seventeen-year-old daughter of Jaciel, a talented goldsmith, the estranged daughter of the current Abhorsen and a cousin of the King. A descendant of two of the ancient bloodlines that bind the Kingdom to the Charter, Clariel is a berserk, uninterested in Charter Magic but whose rage and strong will gives her a latent affinity to Free Magic. Clariel's reluctant admission to an academy for the young elite and an encounter with a Free Magic creature leaves her curious about its forbidden power. After a meeting with the King ends badly, Clariel is taken to dine at the Governor's manor, where a chance encounter uncovers that Kilp's son (Clariel's unwanted fianc√©) has consorted with a Free Magic creature to cheat his way up the Guild. Clariel's family is killed in the fighting that follows, Clariel briefly escapes, only to be captured. On the verge of escaping once more she is rescued and is spirited away to the Abhorsen's estates in the south, only to be locked away by the Abhorsen for her own safety. Fearing that her parents will not be avenged, Clariel conspires with Mogget to free two of the Free Magic entities imprisoned in the House and to bind them to do her bidding. In the process of doing so, Clariel corrupts her Charter Mark, weakening her link with the Charter and her ability to perform Charter Magic, but at the same time allowing her to perform feats of magic using her own raw willpower to shape and control Free Magic. When she reaches the city, she kills Kilp and his son and rescues the King, only to nearly be killed by the creatures she has bound. She is saved by Belatiel, the new Abhorsen, but is disfigured and badly injured. Belatiel assists her to the forests of the far north, and gives her a bronze mask she earlier used to protect herself from Free Magic. Clariel is destined to later become Chlorr of the Mask. =Goldenhand= Feeling restless after the events of Abhorsen and reeling from the loss of the Disreputable Dog, Lirael makes her way to The Wall to find Nicholas Sayre lying there unconscious, having woken up a Hrule ‚Äî a rare free magic creature which drinks blood. From there, they journey to the Clayr's Glacier for further medical attention. At the same time, Ferin of the Athask is racing towards the Clayr's Glacier with an urgent message from Lirael's mother. Chlorr of the Mask is doing everything to stop her, as she brings necromancers together to battle at the Greenwash Bridge. Nicholas is discovered to be capable of acting as a Charter Stone, and so he and Lirael journey to the north in order to send Chlorr of the Mask to her final resting place. =Terciel and Elinor= Bonnier Books UK has signed a deal with Garth Nix for a new novel in the Old Kingdom series and his backlist, marking the first time the series will be housed under one roof in the UK. The new novel in the YA Old Kingdom series, Terciel and Elinor, will be published in 2021, with a major sales, publicity and marketing campaign, alongside a rebrand for Nix and the Old Kingdom series. The novel will be about how Sabriel's parents first met, amongst other things. Novellas and Short Stories =The Creature in the Case= The novella The Creature in the Case was published for 2005 World Book Day (HarperCollins Children's Books, March 2005, ). It was retitled \\"Nicholas Sayre and the Creature in the Case\\" for collection in Across the Wall: A Tale of the Abhorsen and Other Stories (2005). According to the publisher, \\"It is six months since the cataclysmic events of Abhorsen ...\\". Nicholas Sayre is sent by his Uncle Edward to a party, to observe the workings of a clandestine government organisation responsible for gathering information about the Old Kingdom. The organisation's head, Alastor Dorrance, has covertly obtained a monstrous 'Hrule' and intends to free it across the Wall; and when he attempts to do so, it runs amok, destroying numerous people until pursued by Nicholas to the Wall, where it is rendered harmless by Lirael. =An Extract of the Journal of Idrach the Lesser Necromancer= This short story was distributed by the Old Kingdom series web siteoldkingdom.com.au ‚Äì An Extract of the Journal of Idrach the Lesser Necromancer and collected in Across the Wall (Allen & Unwin (Australia), 2005). =An Essay on Free Magic= A short text released on the Old Kingdom Website http://oldkingdom.com.au/extras_freemagic.html#.XwJB_C14VvI. =To Hold the Bridge= The novella To Hold the Bridge was published in 2010 as part of the anthology Legends of Australian Fantasy, edited by Jack Dann and Jonathan Strahan (HarperCollins Publishers Australia, 2010, ).

Magic =The Charter and Free Magic= In the Old Kingdom, magic takes two forms: Free Magic or Charter Magic. The former is older, and natural in origin, whereas the latter is imposed (in-universe, by the immortal 'Seven Bright Shiners') as an assurance of order. Some Free Magic remains in the world, mainly in various breeds of monster (several are named: Stilken, Margrue, Hish, Ferenk, and Hrule). The Charter is described as an \\"endless flow\\" of symbols describing the cosmos; each used by magicians to achieve psychokinesis. The composition of spells ranges from single Charter marks to long series requiring a 'master mark' and sometimes a physical focus (typically a sword or wand). Though Free Magic is 'corrosive' to living things and Charter Magic, Free Magic spells are required to pass the Gates of Death, and the calls of the Abhorsen's bells are Free Magic spells subject to the Charter. Although the Abhorsen may use Free Magic without suffering long-term ill effects, typical necromancers are ultimately \\"devoured by the Free Magic they profess to master\\". Practitioners of Charter Magic have a Charter Mark drawn on their forehead at birth. Marks unsullied by Free Magic are used to identify true Charter Mages (as opposed to Free Magic sorcerers or constructs in disguise). The Five Great Charters: In Sabriel, the Five Great Charters are identified by a song: Five Great Charters knit the land. Together linked, hand in hand. One in the people who wear the Crown. Two in the folk who keep the Dead down. Three and Five became stone and mortar. Four sees all in frozen water. This rhyme dictates that at some point in history the Five Great Charters were concentrated in physical objects, or human bloodlines. The bloodlines are those of the royals, the Abhorsen, the Clayr, and the Wallmakers. After this, the entire Wallmaker line physically became the Great Charter Stones and the Wall that separates the Old Kingdom from Ancelstierre, to prevent contamination of their descent. The Great Charter Stones are located in an underground reservoir in the Old Kingdom's capital, Belisaere, and are the sources of Charter Magic in the Old Kingdom. Under the influence of the Wall, magic, both Free and Charter, exists only in the Old Kingdom; but can be practised in northern Ancelstierre, and further south if there is a strong wind from the Old Kingdom. =Bestiary= Strictly speaking, there are five basic supernatural creatures in the Old Kingdom series: The Dead: The Dead are ghosts with both the inclination and the ability to resist the river of Death, who re-enter the world of Life. Though a rare few emerge into Life on their own power, most must be summoned by a necromancer or emerge near a broken Charter Stone (where the Charter's influence has been severely diminished, creating a \\"door into Death\\"), or where many deaths have recently occurred. All Dead are averse to running water, and most are unable to withstand direct sunlight. There are two classes of Dead: Lesser and Greater. The Greater Dead are usually represented by Dead from beyond the Fifth Gate (spirits from the deeper realms of Death and correspondingly more powerful). Examples of the Greater Dead include Chlorr of the Mask, Lathal the Abomination (ultimately destroyed by Lirael), and Kerrigor (defeated by Sabriel). Greater Dead, such as Fifth-Gate Resters or Dead Adepts, may exist in Life without a physical body (making them much more difficult to destroy). The name of Lesser Dead refers to Dead Hands, Ghlims, Mordauts, and Gore Crows: a range of re-embodied spirits, often used by necromancers as weapons. Lesser Dead may be incapacitated by immersing them in running water or by destroying their physical bodies with Charter Magic or explosives; Shadow Hands are impossible to harm by strictly physical means, but may be unraveled by specialized Charter Magic spells or returned to Death by the necromantic bells. Most Dead prey on the living to remain in Life. Constructs: Free Magic constructs are forms assumed by Free Magic elementals or powerful Dead spirits (such as Kerrigor). Though such constructs may be destroyed, destroying the Elemental itself is much more difficult and typically the province of Free Magic. Mordicants: These are fiery constructs of clay and blood, animated by Free Magic and guided by a Greater Dead spirit able to move between Life and Death at will. They are fierce combatants, and seem to have enhanced senses, able to track specific targets over hundreds of miles, resisting direct sunlight to do so. The word mordicant comes from a Latin term meaning gnawing. Free Magic Elementals: These are free-willed beings wholly composed of Free Magic. The most common elementals belong to specific \\"breeds\\" (such as Stilken, Magrue, Jerreq, or Hish), while the most powerful are unique, or \\"of a singular nature\\". Though \\"many thousands\\" of Free Magic Elementals escaped the creation of the Charter, most were later imprisoned or enslaved by it. Of the remainder, \\"no truly dangerous creature of Free Magic has woken in a thousand years, save to the sound of Mosrael and Saraneth, or by a direct summons using their secret names\\". Some cannot be destroyed except by a Free Magic sorcerer more powerful than they, or by immersion in running water (though Free Magic creatures of the Third Kindred, or those infused with the essence of the Nine, are exempt from this rule). Charter Magic is typically ineffective. Charter Sendings: Charter Sendings are servants or sentries constructed entirely of Charter Marks. Many may only act within a given function, which can be of indefinite complexity. Certain fixtures excepted (such as a surcoat or insignia), Charter Sendings do not possess a concrete physical shape, and derive identity primarily from their function. They are capable of emotive response, but show little desire except to fulfill their mandates. =The Bells= The bells of necromancy are seven eponymous bells used by necromancers to control the Dead, named after the Seven Bright Shiners who invested themselves in the Charter. From smallest to largest they are: Ranna, the Sleeper, prompting drowsiness in the auditor; Mosrael, the Waker, transmitting the ringer further into Death but the auditor into Life; Kibeth, the Walker, which can give the Dead freedom of movement or force them to walk according to the ringer's intention; Dyrim, the Speaker, used either to revive or annul the hearer's ability to speak; Belgaer, the Thinker, used to restore or remove memory; Saraneth, the Binder, a favorite of the Abhorsens, used to control the Dead directly; and Astarael, the Weeper, also named Sorrowful, which sends both ringer and auditor far into Death. Each bell has a specific power over the Dead and Free Magic creatures, and if used by a skilled necromancer, also on living people. An errant or improper ring can affect the caster instead of the target, or cause other adverse effects. The Abhorsens' bells are a \\"free-willed blend of Charter and Free Magic\\", though the spells they cast are \\"pure Free Magic\\". =The Nine Bright Shiners= The most advanced and powerful Free Magic elementals, of which seven created the Charter and are represented by the necromancers' bells. Of the remaining two, Yrael later became Mogget, the Abhorsens' companion; and Orannis, \\"last and mightiest of the Nine\\", opposed the Charter and was imprisoned by the Seven. According to \\"An Extract of the Journal of Idrach the Lesser Necromancer\\", a text posted on the series' website, the correlation of the Seven and the necromantic bells includes the Precincts of Death, with each bell equalling a specific Precinct. This would suggest that the additional precincts are related to the 8th and 9th \\"Bright Shiners\\", although it is not known which Precinct corresponds to which Bright Shiner. Because Astarael appears under Abhorsen's House and Kibeth as the Disreputable Dog, it can be inferred that Ranna, Mosrael, Dyrim, Belgaer, and Saraneth became the Five Great Charters. These Great Charters invested themselves entirely within the bloodlines and artifacts of the Old Kingdom, as opposed to Astarael and Kibeth, who retained enough of themselves to remain separate entities (the Disreputable Dog points out that she is only Kibeth in a \\"hand-me-down sort of way\\"). It is implied that Saraneth and Mosrael wove themselves into the Abhorsen and Clayr bloodlines respectively. Additionally, Lirael (a \\"Remembrancer\\", only made possible by her shared Clayr and Abhorsen heritage) is referred to as \\"Astarael's get\\" in The Creature in the Case, and Prince Sameth is referred to as a \\"Wallmaker\\" (Ranna and Belgaer) in Abhorsen. Dyrim is considered the Great Charter of the royal bloodline. Yrael, also known as Mogget, initially refused to take a side for or against Orannis, and was therefore later enslaved to the Abhorsen by the other immortals. Whenever unbound, he tries to kill the current Abhorsen; but, during Orannis' second binding, he assists in the binding ritual. To Sabriel, Lirael, and Sameth, Mogget appears as a small white cat; to Terciel, Sabriel's father and predecessor as Abhorsen, Mogget adopted a different (unknown) name and appeared as an albino dwarf. Mogget cannot use his dwarf-form without the permission of the current Abhorsen or Abhorsen-in-Waiting: Jerizael, the forty-eighth Abhorsen, forbade him from doing so for reasons unknown. At the end of the series, he re-appears as a cat. In Lirael, when Orannis possesses Nicholas Sayre and speaks to the necromancer Hedge, the story of the Binding is told in a song very similar to the English folk song Green Grow the Rushes, O: I'll sing you a song of the long ago. Seven shine the Shiners, oh! What did the Seven do way back when? Why, they wove the Charter then! Five for the warp, from beginning to end. Two for the woof, to make and mend. That's the Seven, but what of the Nine‚Äî What of the two that chose not to shine? The Eighth did hide, hide all away, But the Seven caught him and made him pay. The Ninth was strong and fought with might, But lone Orannis was put out of the light, Broken in two and buried under hill, Forever to lie there wishing us ill. =Death= Death consists of Nine Precincts divided by Nine Gates, through which a grey river flows. Almost everything in Death is a bleak grey, and a subtle grey fogginess limits visibility. The river may also contain and conceal hostile dead beings, who attack living travelers. Only Abhorsens, Remembrancers, or Free Magic Necromancers can cross the boundary at will. Dead spirits can cross only when aided by a Necromancer, or when the border is weakened by a concentration of (often violent) deaths. Dexterity and great willpower are required to resist the current, which is psychological as well as physical. Each gate responds to a Free Magic spell wielded by Abhorsens and Necromancers; Dead cannot pass any Gate unless they are very powerful. Each Precinct contains a different peril. The First Precinct is mostly knee-deep water, but has eddies and pools dangerous to the interloper. Its Gate is a huge waterfall. The Second Precinct has pitfalls throughout its domain and low visibility; its Gate is a whirlpool. The Third Precinct has slightly warmer ankle-deep water and visibility is slightly improved. Periodic, irresistible waves carry dead creatures through the Gate (a wall of mist), often beyond the final Ninth Gate. The Fourth Precinct has a low concentration of Dead, as most of those who reach it have been stunned by the Third Precinct's waves, and are carried easily to the dangerous and deceptively short waterfall that comprises its Gate. The Fifth Precinct is too deep to wade, and must be crossed by a thin black bridge that frequently attracts dead creatures. The water in the Fifth Precinct has strong mutagenic properties, and is implied to be partially responsible for the monstrous appearance of some Greater Dead and necromancers. The Gate is a vertical river rising from the floor. The Sixth Precinct has no current, and its water is present as a shallow pool. There are many Dead creatures in this Precinct, some of whom are Greater Dead. The Gate has no substance and can appear anywhere, but appears as a lift bordered by a cylinder of water. The Seventh Precinct is not described, though presumably it is similar to the First and Fourth Precincts. Its Gate is a line of fire that stretches across the river. The Eighth Precinct resembles the First and Fourth, but interspersed with flashes of fire. The Eighth Gate is a wall of darkness, which needs a spell to send a necromancer into the Ninth Precinct. The Ninth Precinct is an endless pool of deep, still, clear water. It is warmer than the other precincts and there is no fog, allowing a necromancer to see in every direction. The Ninth Gate, resembling a starry sky, confirms the final death of any who look upon it, except those to whom remain a native span of years. Those claimed by the Gate rise at varying speeds and vanish, never to return. People =Abhorsens= The Abhorsens are the lineage who imprison and destroy Dead and Free Magic, wherever it threatens mortal life, though inheritance is not always direct; the next Abhorsen could be a niece or cousin or sibling, rather than the current Abhorsen's child. The Abhorsen combines Charter Magic and Free Magic in its bells to control the dead, righting the wrongs created by Necromancers or Free Magic organisms. The Abhorsens' stronghold, called Abhorsen's House, is located on an island in close proximity to a great waterfall; the associated rapids complement the magical wards of the House in keeping the Dead from accessing it. In Nicholas Sayre and the Creature in the Case, the antagonist Hrule calls them \\"Astarael's get\\". The origin of the name \\"Abhorsen\\", according to Garth Nix, is the name of the executioner from Shakespeare's Measure for Measure: \\"Abhorson\\". =The Clayr= The Clayr are an oracular group composed nearly entirely of women, who live in a snowy mountain called the Clayr's Glacier, in the northern part of the Old Kingdom. Nearly all are beautiful and possess nut-brown skin, pale blond hair, and eyes of blue or green. The Glacier is also home to the Great Library of the Clayr, which contains a variety of treasures, monsters, and rarities in addition to books. Due to the Clayr's precognitive Sight, there are often rooms created for events which unfold decades or centuries later, including the room in which Lirael discovers her fate. =The Wall Garrison= Soldiers who patrol the wall between The Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre. Places =The Old Kingdom= The Old Kingdom is the setting for most of the series; corresponding roughly to Scotland. Ancelstierre (representing England) and the Old Kingdom travel differently through time, with the hour of the day and the season of the year rarely in synchrony; therefore it is possible to spend more time in the Old Kingdom than is absent from Ancelstierre. Two hundred years before Sabriel, the reigning Queen and her two daughters were murdered by Kerrigor and their blood used to break two of the six Great Charter Stones. This event was followed by two hundred years of interregnum. =Ancelstierre= It has been suggested, in a question/answer section of Across the Wall: A Tale of the Abhorsen and Other Stories, by the Disreputable Dog (in Lirael), and some online sources that The Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre are two different parallel realities, that overlap slightly at the Wall. The Old Kingdom also has a northern border which is a river gorge, much farther north than The Clayr's Glacier, where it impinges on another world. Ancelstierre is culturally and technologically based on pre-WWI Britain.

It is located south of the town of Usk and north of Caerleon, in the valley of the River Usk. The village itself had a population of 444. https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W37000309  History and buildings  The village was traditionally founded by the 6th-century Cornish Saint Cybi. According to legend, he is supposed to have crossed the Bristol Channel with ten followers. The life of St. Cybi, written much later and therefore including some questionable material, records that the local king, Edelig son of Glywys, threatened to evict them from his land, but as he approached them he fell from his horse, which died, and he and his men became blind. Edelig then prostrated himself and gave his body and soul to God, and he and his attendants were immediately cured and the horse restored to life. Edelig then, in thanks, gave Cybi land for two churches, including the one which became known as Llangybi, and another at an unspecified location (possibly Llandegfedd, a neighbouring village) where he is reported to have left a handbell. =Church of St. Cybi= The existing church, dedicated to St. Cybi (or Cuby), has been described as \\"one of the most interesting in the Usk valley\\" and \\"a delight\\".John Newman, The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire, 2000, The tower, nave and chancel all date from the 13th or 14th century, and the church has 17th-century internal fittings, including the pulpit, font, and monuments to the local Williams family. There are also wall paintings dating from the late medieval period and the 17th century. One which is of particular interest is a \\"Christ of the trades\\", or more correctly a Sunday Christ, of which there are very few in the UK. Outside is the site of a traditional well, also named for St. Cybi. The church is a Grade II* listed building. The church is in regular use and is now part of a benefice with Llanbadoc, Tredunnock and Coed-y-paen. There is a bell ringing club. In 2015 the church was temporarily closed after major problems were discovered with the walls. Professional inspections revealed that the ceiling was at risk and several rare 15th and 17th century paintings were in danger of falling off the walls from hidden damp. With the estimated cost of renovation work put at possibly ¬£100,000, a local fund-raising campaign was established to save the church. With the help of various funds, such as the Heritage Lottery Fund, work began. In October 2015 Monmouth MP David Davies boosted the appeal by giving Reverend Pamela Love, assistant curate for the four churches in the Llangybi group, two open return first class train tickets. Regular services continue to be held in the chancel. =Llangibby or Tregrug Castle= The site of Llangibby Castle, also known as Tregrug Castle, is located almost a mile outside the village. The estate, including an existing motte and bailey castle, came into the ownership of the de Clare family in 1245. A new large, ambitious and heavily fortified stone castle was started in the early 14th century possibly by Bogo de Clare, uncle of Gilbert de Clare who was killed at Bannockburn in 1314. For a while it was within the dispensation of the Despenser family and it may have been Hugh Despenser the Younger who began to build what remains of the late medieval construction. It was attacked during the revolt of Llywelyn Bren in 1316. After coming into Crown ownership it was sold to the Williams family of Usk in 1554. During the English Civil War the run-down castle was re-fortified and held by Sir Trevor Williams, 1st Baronet, an influential local man whose loyalties to his locality, community and family remained firm even though his loyalties to his King, patrons and the establishment were severely tested by events during that turbulent time. The castle was slighted as a result. Its ruins still remain, surrounded by dense woodland. They include a huge rectangular walled enclosure on the top of the hillside, surrounded by ditches, and including the remains of a large stone tower, known as the Lord's Tower, and a gatehouse. The Williams family built a new house nearby later in the 17th century; it was demolished in 1951. In 2010, the old castle remains at Tregrug (or Tregruk) were investigated by the Channel 4 series Time Team. The programme concluded that the ditches surrounding the walls were Civil War defences, and that the castle had been substantially remodelled in the 17th century to provide a new main entrance and to landscape the area inside the walls to form a \\"pleasance\\" containing gardens and fountains. =The White Hart= The White Hart The White Hart inn a Grade II* listed building, was first built in the early 16th century and was to become the property of Henry VIII as part of Jane Seymour's wedding dowry. A century later Oliver Cromwell is reputed to have used it as his headquarters in Monmouthshire during the English Civil War. The interior still retains no fewer than 11 fireplaces from the 17th century, a wealth of exposed beams, original Tudor period plasterwork and even a priest hole. The Catholic martyr David Lewis preached in the inn when the church was closed to him; he was executed in Usk in 1679. In 2003 Philip Edwards, former King Alfred professor of English literature at Liverpool University suggested that T. S. Eliot made cryptic reference to this pub and the village well in his 1935 poem \\"Usk\\". Refurbishment of the inn was completed in April 2007. =Multiple family murder= In 1878 Spanish sailor Josef Garcia was convicted, at the Sessions House, Usk, of the murder in the village of William and Elizabeth Watkins and their three youngest children (Charlotte, 8 years, Alice, 5 years and Frederick, 4 years).Roger Williams (2004), Their Deadly Trade: Murders in Monmouthshire, Gomer Press. Governance Llangybi is included in the Llangybi Fawr electoral ward, which stretches northeast-southwest from Llantrisant to Llanhennock. The total population of this ward at the 2011 census was 1,861.

Various types of climbing formwork exist, which are either relocated from time to time, or can even move on their own (usually on hydraulic jacks, required for self-climbing and gliding formworks).  Process  Best known in the construction of towers, skyscrapers and other tall vertical structures, it allows the reuse of the same formwork over and over and over for identical (or very similar) sections / stories further up the structure. It can also enable very large concrete structures to be constructed in one single pour (which may take days or weeks as the formwork rises with the process), thus creating seamless structures with enhanced strength and visual appearance, as well as reducing construction times and material costs (at the joints which would otherwise require extra reinforcement / connectors).\\"Chicago high-rise with self-climbing formwork\\".

This may entail lifting the whole section, or be achieved segmentally. *Climbing formwork (self-climbing): In this type of formwork, the structure elevates itself with the help of mechanic leverage equipment (usually hydraulic). To do this, it is usually fixed to sacrificial cones or rails emplaced in the previously cast concrete.\\"Building towers over Auckland's North Shore\\".

In 2013, he returned to his hometown team Link√∂pings HC, where he spent the following three seasons. On March 5, 2016, he signed a two-year contract with Lausanne HC of the NLA. He received NLA Regular Season Defenceman of the Year honors in 2016‚Äì17. Junland's final years in Lausanne were awful; he struggled to keep up with the pace of the NL and ended up being a healthy scratch even though the team had only 4 import players on the roster. On January 13, 2020, Lausanne released Junland from his contract. He later returned to his original Swedish club, Link√∂pings HC.

is a modern short-range infrared homing (\\"heat seeking\\") air-to-air missile, featuring countermeasures resistance with a 180-degree look angle and 120-degrees per second track rate, developed by South Africa's Denel Dynamics (formerly Kentron) and Brazil's Mectron (now SIATT), Avibras and Opto Eletr√¥nica. It will equip the South African Air Force's Saab JAS 39 Gripen C/D and BAe Hawk 120, and the Brazilian Air Force's A-1M AMX, Northrop F-5BR and Gripen E/F. It was expected to be in production before the end of 2015. Development Development of the A-Darter began in 1995, but the program suffered from inadequate funding and changes to the SAAF's requirements. Mectron, Avibras and Atech joined the program in 2006 after a three-year negotiation process with US$52 million invested by the Brazilian Government in the project, estimated to be worth US$130 million. In that same year, Denel announced that it would use the latest solid-state inertial measurement unit, the SiIMU02 from BAE Systems, for mid course range guidance. The Brazilian company Opto Eletr√¥nica has partnered with Denel Dynamics in the development of the missile imaging infrared seeker for thermal guidance. Ground seeker tests were concluded in January 2010, while trajectory guidance and agility flight tests were performed in February 2010. Prototypes were sent to Saab AB to begin the integration of the missile to the Saab JAS 39 Gripen. Captive flight trials were concluded in March 2010. The first successful in-flight launch from a Gripen fighter took place on 17 June 2010. In March 2012, Denel Dynamics disclosed that the missile, which was to be ready for production by end of 2013, entered the qualification phase. Several testing firings at Denel's Overberg Test Range were carried out from a Gripen in January 2012. Final testing included the use of high-speed target drones to simulate an aircraft by towing infrared targets at high speed. In December 2012, the Brazilian air force commissioned Denel to build a factory in S√£o Jos√© dos Campos, close to Mectron, Avibras and Opto Eletr√¥nica. In February 2015, Denel Dynamics signed an agreement with Marotta Controls for supply of the latter's MPACT pure air compression technology to cool the A-Darter's infrared seeker. Production In March 2015 SAAF ordered an undisclosed number of missiles from Denel Dynamics. Design The missile seeker can be slaved to the Helmet Mounted Display (HMD), allowing the pilot to track a target beyond the aircraft's radar scan envelope using the missile's high off- boresight capability, achieved by the pilot turning his head towards the target to lock-on, better known as \\"look and shoot\\". The missile can then be launched and can immediately pull extreme g-force to reverse its course to engage a target behind the aircraft, sometimes called an \\"over-the-shoulder\\". Engage modes include Lock-On After Launch (LOAL) capability to engage targets outside its seeker's acquisition range, and Lock-On Before Launch (LOBL) capability where the target is identified and designated before launch. The two colour thermal imaging technology and a laser proximity fuse fitted on the missile provide multiple Electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) techniques with targeting algorithms including advanced spatial filtering techniques and velocity profiling. The A-Darter has four major sections: guidance section, warhead, control, and rocket motor. It uses a streamlined design with low aerodynamic drag in a wingless airframe, ensuring ranges beyond those of traditional short-range missiles. It is fitted with a thrust vectoring control (TVC) system that allows for turning at up to 100g. The absence of aluminium powder in the motor propellent inhibits production of a smoke trail, which means no visual warning for enemy aircraft. According to SAAF fighter pilots involved within the project, the A-Darter it is better than the IRIS-T in some respects.

The centre of the Unilever campaign is a 75-second spot produced by Ogilvy & Mather in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The piece was first displayed online on 6 October 2006, and was later broadcast as a television and cinema spot in the Netherlands and the Middle East. The ad was created from the budget left over from the earlier Daughters campaign, and was intended to be the first in a series of such online-focused campaigns by the company. Later such videos include Onslaught and Amy. Evolution was directed by Canadian director Yael Staav and Tim Piper, with sound design handled by the Vapor Music Group, and post-production by SoHo. The advert was a critical, popular, and financial success. It won a number of awards in the advertising industry, including two Cannes Lions Grand Prix awards and an Epica D'Or. It has been discussed in many mainstream television programmes and print publications, and the exposure generated by the spot has been estimated to be worth over $150M. Evolution has also spawned numerous unofficial alternate versions, including a title sequence to a BBC sketch show and the short parody Slob Evolution, which has gone on to itself be nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award.  Sequence  The film opens with a \\"pretty, but ordinary girl\\" (Canadian cartoonist and television producer Stephanie Betts) entering and sitting down in a studio.. Two harsh lights are then switched on and the first bars of The Flashbulb's \\"Passage D,\\" a breakcore-piece with piano accompaniment, are heard.. The short credits sequence provides the title of the film and credit to Dove. The camera then switches to a time lapse sequence, showing makeup and hair artist Diana Carreiro making Betts up and adjusting her hair, transforming her into a \\"strikingly beautiful billboard model.\\" When the final physical adjustments of Betts's appearance have been made, the team members all move off-camera, and a series of camera flashes begins as the photographer takes shots of Betts in various poses. One shot is selected from the batch and moved into a generic image editing software interface, where a series of \\"Photoshopping\\" adjustments are made to alter Betts's appearance even further, including but not limited to lengthening her neck, adjusting the curve of her shoulders, altering her hair and skin, and enlarging her eyes and mouth. The final image of Betts, now rendered almost unrecognizable, is then transferred to a billboard advertisement for the fictional \\"Easel\\" (or \\"Fasel\\") brand of foundation makeup. As the camera zooms out from the billboard, two young girls can be seen walking past and looking up at Betts' heavily edited image. The video fades to the statement, \\"No wonder our perception of beauty is distorted.\\" The film ends with an invitation to take part in the \\"Dove Real Beauty Workshops,\\" the logo for the Dove Self-Esteem Fund, and, in some versions, the website address of Unilever- Dove's Campaign For Real Beauty, for which the film was originally produced.  Background  The Dove Campaign For Real Beauty was launched by Unilever in 2003, to coincide with the expansion of the Dove brand from soaps and other cleansing solutions to health and beauty products in general, including deodorants, shower gels, hair-care and skin-care products. The first stage of the campaign centred around a series of billboard advertisements, initially put up in the United Kingdom, and later worldwide. The spots showcased photographs of regular women (in place of professional models), taken by portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz.. The ads invited passers-by to vote on whether a particular model was, for example, \\"Fat or Fab\\" or \\"Wrinkled or Wonderful\\", and the results of the votes dynamically updated and displayed on the billboard itself.. Accompanying the billboard advertisements was the publication of the \\"Dove Report\\", a corporate study which Unilever intended to \\"[create] a new definition of beauty [which] will free women from self-doubt and encourage them to embrace their real beauty.\\". The series received significant media coverage from talk shows, women's magazines, and mainstream news broadcasts and publications,. generating media exposure which Unilever has estimated to be worth more than 30 times the paid-for media space.. Following this success, the campaign expanded into other media, including a series of television spots (Flip Your Wigs and the Pro-Age series, among others) and print advertisements (\\"Tested on Real Curves\\"). This culminated in the 2006 Little Girls global campaign, which featured regional versions of the same advertisement in both print and screen,U.S. and Filipino versions, for example. for which Unilever purchased a 30-second spot in the commercial break during Super Bowl XL at an estimated cost of US$2.5M. In 2006, Ogilvy & Mather were seeking to extend the campaign further, by creating one or more viral videos to host on the Campaign for Real Beauty website. The first of these, Daughters, was an interview-style piece intended to show how mothers and daughters related to issues surrounding the modern perception of beauty and the beauty industry. It was during the production of Daughters that a series of short films titled \\"Beauty Crackdown\\", one of which was Evolution, was promoted to Unilever as an \\"activation idea\\".. The concept was one that art director Tim Piper pushed; he proposed to have Evolution produced using the money left over from the budget for Daughters. This ended up amounting to a total of C$135,000. It was originally intended to get people to the Campaign for Real Beauty website to see Daughters, and to participate in the workshops featured on the site.  Production  The team brought together for the ad included director Yael Staav, the first female director to win a Cannes Lion (for Hugging, a campaign for the ALS Society of Canada),. fashion photographers Tiko Poulakakis and Gabor Jurina, makeup artist Diana Carreiro, art director Tim Piper, and Piper's then-girlfriend Stephanie Betts as the model. Betts, a cartoonist and producer of Canadian animated television programming such as Producing Parker, was chosen as the model for Evolution in part because Piper was first inspired to write the piece after seeing the amount of time his girlfriend spent applying make-up,. and he felt that she would be an ideal \\"representation of the norm\\", highlighting the extreme changes that models undergo in the fashion industry. She was originally dubious about taking on the role but later stated that she was proud that she joined the campaign. The actual production itself took place over the course of a single day, and over two-and-a-half hours of footage was taken for the make-up portion of the film. This was eventually condensed to 23 seconds in the final version. The stage was dressed in a manner identical to that of modern fashion shoots, with the lighting and camera being positioned to remove any shadows from Betts's face to aid in the post-production retouching. Sound design took three weeks, and was divided into two sections. Fifteen hours were spent creating several mixes of \\"Passage D\\" with each mix tested and discarded before the version used in the final film was settled upon. A further nine hours were spent adding in the various background noises to the piece, including sped-up human voices, a starter pistol and galloping racehorses. Post-production at SoHo was originally planned to take approximately three days, but it was extended to two weeks. Gabor Jurina, the photographer responsible for the digital retouching of the actual photographs taken of Betts during the shoot, supplied the post-production team with 118 digital stills of the intermediate stages of the transformation from the \\"real\\" photograph of the made-up Betts to the final image shown on the billboard. These were re-cut and assembled to create the functions shown in the \\"Photoshopping\\" sequence, such as stretching Betts's neck and adjusting the size of certain of her facial features. Other post-production work included stabilising Betts's head in the center of the shot during the make-up sequence, covering certain continuity errors, creating and compositing the billboard advertisement, and constructing a false image-editing interface.  Release and reception  Evolution was incorporated into the Canadian Campaign for Real Beauty website on 6 October 2006 in order to coincide with the start of the Los Angeles Fashion Week,. and was uploaded by art director Tim Piper to video sharing website YouTube shortly after. While it has remained a largely internet-based campaign, Evolution has appeared as a television commercial in the Netherlands and the Middle East,. and in the U.S. inside commercial breaks in The Hills. Once uploaded, the advert was viewed over 40,000 times in its first day,. 1.7 million times within a month of its upload, and 12 million times within its first year.. Even without having appeared offline, the advert was discussed by a number of mainstream television programmes, including Good Morning America, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, and The View, and news networks such as CNN, NBC, and ABC News; the overwhelming majority came out in support of the campaign's message. Spaces at the mother and daughter workshops sold out almost immediately, and the total exposure generated through the $50,000 piece was estimated by Ogilvy & Mather in October 2006 as being worth around $150M.. Comparisons have often been drawn up between the campaign and Dove's earlier purchase of a 30-second spot for Little Girls during the Super Bowl XL. The Super Bowl spot cost an estimated $2.5M, reached an audience of 500 million, and generated only one third of the boost in traffic to the Campaign for Real Beauty website of Evolution.. The spot was also credited for its part in producing double-figure growth in sales of Dove product, and Unilever reported that its overall sales in the period following the release of Evolution rose by 5.8%, up from 3.9% the previous year. Evolution was particularly popular with critics within the advertising industry, and has garnered a number of awards since its debut in October 2006. It was the favourite in the run up to the Cannes Lions to win the festival's Grand Prix in the Cyber category,. generally considered one of the most prestigious awards in the industry. Ultimately, the prize went to three entries: Nike+, advertising the Nike brand, Heidies 15 MB of Fame, promoting fashion company Diesel S.p.A.'s website and products, and Evolution. Evolution also went on to win the Grand Prix in the Film category,. beating Pretty from Nike, Inc., Paint for Sony's BRAVIA line of high-definition television sets, and The Power of Wind for the Wind Energy Initiative. The victory attracted a certain amount of controversy, as the jury switched Evolution from the \\"Fundraising & Appeals\\" category, whose entries are ineligible to win the Grand Prix, to the \\"Corporate Image\\" category at the last minute. Chairman of the jury Bob Scarpelli said of the decision, \\"We moved it into another category because we felt that strongly about it. We were not trying to break rules or set precedents, we just went with our hearts and minds, and asked the festival if we could move it.\\" As a result of the win, Evolution became the first entry in the festival's history to take home Grand Prix awards from two categories. and the first web-based advertisement to win in the Film category (followed in 2009 by Philips' Carousel)Macleod, Duncan; \\"Philips Carousel for Cinema 21:9\\", Inspiration room, April 20, 2009. Retrieved November 7, 2017. The piece went on to win a number of other awards, including a silver Clio Award (in the Toiletries/Pharmaceuticals category),. the Film Grand Prix and two Gold prizes at the London International Awards,. an Epica D'Or and Gold Prize in the Interactive category of the Epica Awards,. among others..  Music Copyright Violations  On October 17, 2017, the original version of Evolution along with hundreds of copies were removed from Youtube and other video hosting sites due to copyright violation citing \\"Alphabasic Records\\" or \\"Alphabasic Publishing\\" as the claimant. According to Benn Jordan, the writer and owner of the music, Dove had allegedly failed to renew or pay for the music license, causing the publisher and Youtube to remove the videos. On November 8, 2017, Jordan claimed that despite many attempts to resolve the issue, Dove has continued to use his music illegally by not renewing the license.  Legacy  = Slob Evolution = Slob Evolution, a parody of the original Evolution spot, went on to be nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award. The popularity of Evolution and its presence on many video-sharing websites led inevitably to a large number of alternate versions and parodies being uploaded by the public. In under six months, parodies on YouTube alone received over 5 million hits between them,. Of these, by far the most successful was a professionally made piece entitled Slob Evolution. Slob Evolution is an Emmy Award-nominated short film created as a parody of the original Evolution spot in late 2006. The piece was directed by Simon Willows, known for his work on the Volvic mineral water television and cinema commercials, and was produced by Claire Jones with the production company Blink Productions. Post-production work was done by Framestore CFC.. In Slob Evolution, the role of the model is taken by a teenage boy who, instead of having make-up applied in the time-lapse sequence, is given fast food, alcoholic beverages, and cigarettes, transforming over the course of thirty seconds into an overweight middle-aged slob. Further adjustments are made in a similar image-editing interface to that used in Evolution,. The subject's neck is shortened, his features made more asymmetric, and a tattoo is added. The image is transferred to a billboard advertisement for the fictional \\"Lardo\\" brand of \\"man cream\\", and the piece ends with a fade to the statement, \\"Thank God our perception of reality is distorted. No one wants to look at ugly people.\\" The parody was uploaded to video-sharing website YouTube on December 4, 2006 and was promoted only through a seeding of 30 e-mails.. Within its first month, Slob Evolution received over 278,000 hits.. It went on to be nominated for a number of prestigious awards, including the \\"Comedy: Short Form\\" and \\"Viral\\" categories of the 2007 Webby Awards,. and in the \\"Outstanding Broadband Comedy\\" category of the 2007 Daytime Emmy Awards. The popular and critical attention that Blink Productions received for Slob Evolution led to Tiger Aspect, the production company behind the 2007 BBC comedy sketch show Ruddy Hell! It's Harry and Paul, contacting the production company to produce an introduction to the show in a similar vein. frame from the introduction sequence of Ruddy Hell! It's Harry and Paul, showing the familiar billboard. The title sequence to Ruddy Hell! It's Harry and Paul begins with a shot of Morwenna Banks and Laura Solon. The familiar time-lapse sequence shows the pair being given several pints of lager, cigarettes, and fast food. Their hair is cut and their make-up removed as they slowly morph into Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse, the joint hosts of Ruddy Hell! It's Harry And Paul. After bras are removed from the pair's shirts, the camera zooms out to show a billboard advertisement similar to that in Slob Evolution, with the show's title displayed underneath. = Other works = Shortly after releasing Evolution online, post-production company SoHo uploaded a five- minute making-of documentary, which includes interviews with creative directors Janet Kestin and Tim Piper, photographer Gabor Jurina, post- production director Paul Gowan, digital artists Kevin Gibson and Terry Rose, and sound designer Andrew Harris, who discuss the various stages of the post- production process behind the creation of the spot. The making-of also includes a shot of Evolutions storyboard and a short segment of behind-the- scenes footage from the shoot itself, showing Stephanie Betts before and after the make-up process. After the debut of Evolution, Dove quickly ordered several follow-up online advertisements, the first two of which (Onslaught and Amy) appeared online in October 2007. These were also written and directed by Tim Piper. The pair are predicted to prove at least as popular as Evolution. Other companies have attempted to use the same formula, with mixed results. Among the more-commented on campaigns is Beauty is..., launched by Nivea in 2007 and comprising television, print, and online segments which push the same message as the Dove campaign.

Dinky Toy aircraft, completely fragmented by zinc pest Zinc pest (from German Zinkpest), also known as zinc rot and mazak rot, is a destructive, intercrystalline corrosion process of zinc alloys containing lead impurities.. While impurities of the alloy are the primary cause of the problem, environmental conditions such as high humidity (greater than 65%) may accelerate the process.J.Koll. Koll‚Äôs Preiskatalog. Band 1. 2001 Verlag Joachim Koll. It was first discovered to be a problem in 1923, and primarily affects die-cast zinc articles that were manufactured during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. The New Jersey Zinc Company developed zamak alloys in 1929 using 99.99% pure zinc metal to avoid the problem, and articles made after 1960 are usually considered free of the risk of zinc pest since the use of purer materials and more controlled manufacturing conditions make zinc pest degradation unlikely. Affected objects may show surface irregularities such as small cracks and fractures, blisters or pitting. Over time, the material slowly expands, cracking, buckling and warping in an irreversible process that makes the object exceedingly brittle and prone to fracture, and can eventually shatter the object, destroying it altogether. Due to the expansion process, attached normal material may also be damaged. The occurrence and severity of zinc pest in articles made of susceptible zinc alloys depends both on the concentration of lead impurities in the metal and on the storage conditions of the article in the ensuing decades. Zinc pest is dreaded by collectors of vintage die-cast model trains, toys, or radios, because rare or otherwise valuable items can inescapably be rendered worthless as the process of zinc pest destroys them. Because castings of the same object were usually made from various batches of metal over the production process, some examples of a given toy or model may survive today completely unaffected, while other identical examples may have completely disintegrated. Since the 1940s, some model railroad hobbyists have claimed, with varying degrees of success, that a method of \\"pickling\\" zinc alloy parts by soaking them in vinegar or oxalic acid solution for several minutes before painting and assembling them could prevent or delay the effects of zinc pest. Engine parts of older vehicles or airplanes, and military medals made of zinc alloys may also be affected. Zinc pest is different from a superficial white corrosion oxidation process (\\"Weissrost\\") that may affect some zinc articles, and is not related to tin pest.

Originally created as a Ska band, Goodwen has pioneered a genre all their own. Blending aggressive Indie rock with three-piece horn section created a very original sound. Powerful and emotional music was the proverbial fuel for their incredibly energetic live show. The band, composed of seven members, has relentlessly toured the Midwest. Goodwen currently has one full album, En Memoria Vestrum, with plans to release a second in the future. They also have two demo CDs available. The song \\"Question Marks\\" has also been featured in the compilation from Future Destionation Records, Reasons for Living.  Background  The Early Days of Goodwen. Growing up in the household of the signed banjo artist Todd Elam, Tyler and Jordan Elam, (guitar and drums), along with long-time friend Dustin Smith began creating music as early as 2000. Gradually as they began to expand their musical skills, more projects were developed involving more musicians using a variety of different instruments. Cody Madonna, a longtime friend of Jordan, suggested the idea of beginning a Ska band. With this development came the addition of Armond Luckey and his amazing trumpet ability, Dustin Schamaun with a deep appreciation for the underlying tones of jazz saxophone, and Julie Heidorn on trombone. > GOODWEN - Is a six member group from Middletown, Ohio that plays > \\"progressive horn rock\\".

Originally developed by Naum Z. Shor and others in the 1960s and 1970s, subgradient methods are convergent when applied even to a non- differentiable objective function. When the objective function is differentiable, sub-gradient methods for unconstrained problems use the same search direction as the method of steepest descent. Subgradient methods are slower than Newton's method when applied to minimize twice continuously differentiable convex functions. However, Newton's method fails to converge on problems that have non-differentiable kinks. In recent years, some interior- point methods have been suggested for convex minimization problems, but subgradient projection methods and related bundle methods of descent remain competitive. For convex minimization problems with very large number of dimensions, subgradient-projection methods are suitable, because they require little storage. Subgradient projection methods are often applied to large- scale problems with decomposition techniques. Such decomposition methods often allow a simple distributed method for a problem. Classical subgradient rules Let f:\\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} be a convex function with domain \\\\mathbb{R}^n. A classical subgradient method iterates :x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} - \\\\alpha_k g^{(k)} \\\\ where g^{(k)} denotes a subgradient of f \\\\ at x^{(k)} \\\\ , and x^{(k)} is the k^{th} iterate of x. If f \\\\ is differentiable, then its only subgradient is the gradient vector abla f itself. It may happen that -g^{(k)} is not a descent direction for f \\\\ at x^{(k)}. We therefore maintain a list f_{\\\\rm{best}} \\\\ that keeps track of the lowest objective function value found so far, i.e. :f_{\\\\rm{best}}^{(k)} = \\\\min\\\\\\\\{f_{\\\\rm{best}}^{(k-1)} , f(x^{(k)}) \\\\\\\\}. =Step size rules= Many different types of step-size rules are used by subgradient methods. This article notes five classical step-size rules for which convergence proofs are known: *Constant step size, \\\\alpha_k = \\\\alpha. *Constant step length, \\\\alpha_k = \\\\gamma/\\\\lVert g^{(k)} \\\\rVert_2, which gives \\\\lVert x^{(k+1)} - x^{(k)} \\\\rVert_2 = \\\\gamma. *Square summable but not summable step size, i.e. any step sizes satisfying :\\\\alpha_k\\\\geq0,\\\\qquad\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\alpha_k^2 < \\\\infty,\\\\qquad \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\alpha_k = \\\\infty. *Nonsummable diminishing, i.e. any step sizes satisfying :\\\\alpha_k\\\\geq0,\\\\qquad \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\alpha_k = 0,\\\\qquad \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\alpha_k = \\\\infty. *Nonsummable diminishing step lengths, i.e. \\\\alpha_k = \\\\gamma_k/\\\\lVert g^{(k)} \\\\rVert_2, where :\\\\gamma_k\\\\geq0,\\\\qquad \\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\gamma_k = 0,\\\\qquad \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\gamma_k = \\\\infty. For all five rules, the step-sizes are determined \\"off-line\\", before the method is iterated; the step-sizes do not depend on preceding iterations. This \\"off- line\\" property of subgradient methods differs from the \\"on-line\\" step-size rules used for descent methods for differentiable functions: Many methods for minimizing differentiable functions satisfy Wolfe's sufficient conditions for convergence, where step-sizes typically depend on the current point and the current search-direction. An extensive discussion of stepsize rules for subgradient methods, including incremental versions, is given in the books by Bertsekas and by Bertsekas, Nedic, and Ozdaglar. =Convergence results= For constant step-length and scaled subgradients having Euclidean norm equal to one, the subgradient method converges to an arbitrarily close approximation to the minimum value, that is :\\\\lim_{k\\\\to\\\\infty} f_{\\\\rm{best}}^{(k)} - f^* <\\\\epsilon by a result of Shor. The approximate convergence of the constant step-size (scaled) subgradient method is stated as Exercise 6.3.14(a) in Bertsekas (page 636): On page 636, Bertsekas attributes this result to Shor: These classical subgradient methods have poor performance and are no longer recommended for general use. However, they are still used widely in specialized applications because they are simple and they can be easily adapted to take advantage of the special structure of the problem at hand. Subgradient-projection & bundle methods During the 1970s, Claude Lemar√©chal and Phil Wolfe proposed \\"bundle methods\\" of descent for problems of convex minimization. The meaning of the term \\"bundle methods\\" has changed significantly since that time. Modern versions and full convergence analysis were provided by Kiwiel. Contemporary bundle-methods often use \\"level control\\" rules for choosing step-sizes, developing techniques from the \\"subgradient-projection\\" method of Boris T. Polyak (1969). However, there are problems on which bundle methods offer little advantage over subgradient- projection methods. Constrained optimization =Projected subgradient= One extension of the subgradient method is the projected subgradient method, which solves the constrained optimization problem :minimize f(x) \\\\ subject to :x\\\\in\\\\mathcal{C} where \\\\mathcal{C} is a convex set. The projected subgradient method uses the iteration :x^{(k+1)} = P \\\\left(x^{(k)} - \\\\alpha_k g^{(k)} \\\\right) where P is projection on \\\\mathcal{C} and g^{(k)} is any subgradient of f \\\\ at x^{(k)}. =General constraints= The subgradient method can be extended to solve the inequality constrained problem :minimize f_0(x) \\\\ subject to :f_i (x) \\\\leq 0,\\\\quad i = 1,\\\\dots,m where f_i are convex. The algorithm takes the same form as the unconstrained case :x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} - \\\\alpha_k g^{(k)} \\\\ where \\\\alpha_k>0 is a step size, and g^{(k)} is a subgradient of the objective or one of the constraint functions at x. \\\\ Take :g^{(k)} = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\partial f_0 (x) & \\\\text{ if } f_i(x) \\\\leq 0 \\\\; \\\\forall i = 1 \\\\dots m \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\partial f_j (x) & \\\\text{ for some } j \\\\text{ such that } f_j(x) > 0 \\\\end{cases} where \\\\partial f denotes the subdifferential of f \\\\ . If the current point is feasible, the algorithm uses an objective subgradient; if the current point is infeasible, the algorithm chooses a subgradient of any violated constraint.

History Missing grew up in the Bronx during the 1950s and 1960s, as a middle child of three siblings. He's Italian and one-third Danish. His father was a postal worker who delivered to the Empire State Building. Party's over logo He was one of the organizers of the protest against the Tompkins Square Park curfew that led to the Tompkins Square Park Riot. His symbol, an upside down martini glass with three strikes crossed out, means \\"party's over\\". The symbol used to be spotted all over the Lower East Side. It was often accompanied by anti-gentrification, anti-police brutality, anti-corporations, and pro-environment slogans. The symbol was originally designed for a band Missing founded in 1980 called Drunk Driving and has grown to symbolize the decline of our planet and a warning to start something new; time for a change. He founded the influential underground industrial band Missing Foundation while living in Hamburg, Germany in 1984 and imported it to the U.S. in 1985 with new members. The band has included about 20 members over its history. The name came from the East German police unit whose job it was to track down people who fled to West Germany. At shows Missing would sometimes set himself on fire as part of the performance. The band released five albums with Restless Records in L.A. including Your House Is Mine which was named Rock Album of the Week in the New York Times in 1988. Missing has been painting for the past 30 years and has works in over 30 museums in the U.S. and Europe including The Museum of Modern Art, The Whitney Museum of American Art, The Getty Institute, and the Stadt Museum in Berlin.Your House Is Mine, First Edition, Bullet Space, New York, 1980. Until October 2011, Missing had his gallery, Conto Gallery, in Kunsthaus Tacheles in Berlin.

He was working as a porter in Cheapside in 1830, leaving after disputes with his employer, and working at the St Katherine Docks for six years. During those years he was determined to learn a trade and used money from an aunt to purchase a lathe, vice and lumber with which he made a work bench. With those tools he taught himself to turn wood and brass and began to experiment, including with electricity. Henley designed and built a machine in 1837 for covering wires with silk or cotton thread which is now in the London Science Museum (Object Number: 1939-139). The machine may have been Henley's original prototype. Around 1858 Henley developed a needle galvanometer that was installed at the Valentia Island, Ireland shore end of the 1858 transatlantic telegraph cable to receive the first signal from the North American terminus at Heart's Content Cable Station, Newfoundland. That instrument is also in the collection of the museum. He set up as a submarine cable maker in 1857 and by 1859 he had his own factory beside the Thames at North Woolwich. Cable cores, the electrical component and its insulation, were obtained from Stephen William Silver and Hugh Adams Silver's India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Company or William Hooper's company.Hooper's developed its own core sheathing capability and entered the cable laying business as Hooper's Telegraph Works, including construction of the that was the second largest ship of the time and first designed for trans Atlantic cable laying.. He went on to manufacture the shore ends of the second Transatlantic cable in 1865. The firm eventually extended operations to manufacturing gutta-percha and rubber core as well as cable laying and repair. W.T. Henley's Telegraph Works Co., Ltd acquired cable ships for cables it would lay as well as manufacture. One, , was chartered by Siemens Brothers Ltd. to lay cable between Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Chuy, Uruguay after the foundered while laying the cable with loss of of cable. La Plata foundered en- route to complete the lay on 29 November 1874 in the Bay of Biscay with loss of 58 crew and the cable. Other company cable ships were , . and . W. T. Henley Ltd. was acquired by AEI in 1959, and later became part of GEC following its takeover of AEI in 1967. The company was sold to TT electronics in 1997. Today the company is a division of SICAME UK Limited and relocated to a brand new factory at Hoo (near Rochester) in July 2018.

He was born in Swedish Ingria to lieutenant colonel Gustaf Armfelt and Anna Elisabet Brakel. Like other members of his family Armfelt devoted himself to war and at seventeen years' age joined Nylands kavalleri as a cadet. In 1685 he left this position and left for France where he joined prince Ferdinand of F√ºrstenberg's regiment as a mere footsoldier. He campaigned in France for twelve years and returned to Sweden as a captain. Great Northern War Due to his military experience he was employed in the Finnish army as a generaladjutant in 1701 and stayed with this army for most of the Great Northern War. He was named commander of the Finnish army in 1713. During the long war he distinguished himself in several occasions, especially during the defense of Helsingfors in 1713, but met an overwhelming Russian force and was defeated at the battle of Storkyro in 1714. =1718 Norwegian Campaign= In 1717 Armfeldt was promoted to lieutenant general and commanded the Swedish force which on the orders of Charles XII of Sweden was sent into Norway to take Trondheim. Poorly equipped, Armfelt pulled out after the king fell at Fredrikshald. The ensuing disaster that struck his army is known as the Carolean Death March. On New Year's Eve 1718 he arrived at Norwegian Tydal, with 80 kilometers to the closest Swedish village in J√§mtland. When the troops had marched 10 kilometers from Tydalen, a severe blizzard struck from the northwest. The bitter cold killed the guide on the very first day, and the army wandered blindly in the mountains (Sylan mountain range). On the following nights, hundreds more perished. Of the over 5,000 men who left Tydalen, only 2,100 were found alive on arrival at Duved. Later life In 1719 Armfelt was named governor of Viborg county but never took office, as the county was under Russian control and was ceded to Russia after the treaty of Nystad. He was elevated to friherre on 5 July 1731 and named general of infantry in 1735. According to the Pern√• parish records (cited by Hornborg, 1952) he died at Liljendal in Nyland on 24 October 1736, and was interred at Isn√§s on 3 December 1736. He was married in 1700 to Lovisa Aminoff (1685‚Äì1741), daughter of cavalry captain Johan Fredrik Aminoff. Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt is his grandson.

The highest point of DitrƒÉu is the Piricske height. DitrƒÉu was first registered in 1567, as Gitr√≥, with 26 gates. There is a significant syenite reserve near the village. History Szent Katalin Church The villages belonged first to the Sz√©kely seat of Gyergy√≥sz√©k, which was subsequently absorbed into Cs√≠ksz√©k, until the administrative reform of Transylvania in 1876, when they fell within the Cs√≠k County in the Kingdom of Hungary. After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, they became part of Romania and fell within Ciuc County during the interwar period. In 1940, the second Vienna Award granted the Northern Transylvania to Hungary and the villages were held by Hungary until 1944. After Soviet occupation, the Romanian administration returned and the commune became officially part of Romania in 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, the commune fell within the Hungarian Autonomous Province, between 1960 and 1968 the Mure»ô-Hungarian Autonomous Province. In 1968, the province was abolished, and since then, the commune has been part of Harghita County.

The game, the only one in the series to be released on a Nintendo console, was directed by Hideo Ueda and was released in Japan on September 1994, in North America in October 1994, in Europe in 1994. Sparkster is a different game from the Sega Genesis version despite having the same title in North America and Europe, which bore the full title of Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2, and has no plot continuity with the original Rocket Knight Adventures.  Gameplay  Sparkster The eponymous main character is an opossum knight named Sparkster who fights an army of yellow wolves and robots. He is armed with a sword that can fire energy bolts and a rocket pack that allows him to fly short distances. The gameplay remains mostly the same as in Mega Drive/Genesis games, with the most notable change being the addition of a short-distance rolling dash. At the end of every level, Sparkster battles a boss, and the level is complete when it is defeated. The 3rd (2nd in Easy) stage consists of Sparkster riding a robot- ostrich in an auto-scrolling level, while the 7th (5th in Easy) consists of a top-down shooter level. One major difference is that the game's final level depends on the difficulty the player selected. On easy, the game culminates with battle against Axel Gear, but on normal, the story continues with Sparkster fighting the leader of the Wolves on the next level. On hard difficulty, the game continues beyond that, with the true final stage.  Plot  The kingdom of Eginasem, a land inhabited by opossums, is under attack by the Lioness's army of yellow dog and wolf soldiers, which also kidnapped Princess Flora. Sparkster, the Rocket Knight, is out to battle this threat, rescue the princess and save his kingdom from certain destruction. His nemesis, the rival Rocket Knight Axel Gear, is aiding the invading forces, making Sparkster's task even more dangerous. The player's goal is to battle through all of the enemy warriors and robots, defeat Axel Gear and infiltrate the enemy's battleship, where the yellow dogs leader, Generalissimo Lioness, is planning to launch a warhead to destroy planet Eginasem.  Reception  GamePro rated the game positively, but mentioned that it was not a strong enough improvement from the original Rocket Knight Adventures, criticizing the lack of an improved control scheme and new weapons and powerups. However, they praised the impressive graphics, moody music, and the two secret hard modes. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it an 8.2 out of 10, saying that it shows Konami \\"back to form\\" with \\"huge levels, gigantic bosses, outstanding graphics and excellent music.\\" Sparkster was awarded Best Sound Effects of 1994 by Electronic Gaming Monthly.

The estimated population in 2006 was 8,285 inhabitants. The total area of the municipality is and the elevation is . It is located at from state capital Belo Horizonte. S√£o Gon√ßalo do Par√° is the seat of the Regional Administration of the Upper S√£o Francisco River. History church of S√£o Gon√ßalo , in center of S√£o Gon√ßalo do Par√° The creation of the town of S√£o Gon√ßalo of Par√° is closely linked to the revolutionary revolts carried out by miners of the Captainship of Minas Gerais, in 1717. Filipe de Freitas Mour√£o, was a Portuguese gold prospector who worked in the Pitangui mines in the colonial time. He was involved in revolutionary movements against the collection of taxes on gold, which led him to run away together with its wife, Estef√¢nia de Mour√£o Bravo. They escaped to the region of the spring of the River Par√° where they found other Portuguese who had escaped from Vila Rica (Pero Gon√ßalves de Amaranto and Est√°cio Campos de Borgonha). The Portuguese hired Filipe de Freitas as an overseer of slaves. He gave orders in the informal mines and in the plantation, and he went out looking for gold. Accompanied by slaves, he explored some land next to river Par√°, and found a stream with banks suitable for plantations. They called the place \\"Ribeir√£o dos Morais\\" (i.e. the Morais stream). They built farms of wattle and daub. Once the construction was finished, they moved there on 18 December 1723. They placed the image of the Saint Gon√ßalo of the Amarante in a newly built chapel. They had carried the saint's image with them. The Portuguese had a great devotion to this saint. Filipe continued to explore, travelling with slaves, and found an area rich hardwood. In this place, he would start the primitive settling, which would later become S√£o Gon√ßalo of Par√°. In 1735, they finished all the construction, including a chapel with the image of S√£o Gon√ßalo of the Amarante. There was an idea of calling this place \\"Par√° Acima\\". Filipe de Freitas affirmed he had stopped in that place, close to the banks of River Par√°, when he came from Pitangui. The town would hence be named Paragem do Par√° (Stop of Par√°), in September 7th, 1735. From 1751 to 1755, a new church was built in the same place of the old chapel, in baroque style. In 1750 the name of the town changed to S√£o Gon√ßalo of Par√°, alluding to the River Par√°, which had brought the founders, and borders still today the current city. In 1870, the town of S√£o Gon√ßalo of Par√° became part of the district of Pitangui and was annexed to the village Vila de Nossa Senhora da Piedade (presently Par√° de Minas). The town became politically emancipated on 1 January 1949.

The Temple was important on account of its mention in the New Testament, when St Paul was shouted down by the mob, chanting \\"Great is Diana of the Ephesians\\". (Acts 19:34) In 1863, he relinquished his commission and began the search. The British Museum granted him a permit and a small allowance for expenses in return for the property rights in any antiquities he might discover in Ephesus. In February 1866, while excavating in the theatre of Ephesus, Wood found a Greek inscription, which mentioned various gold and silver statuettes, which, on regular occasions, were carried from the temple, through the Magnesian gate, to the theatre. He reasoned that at the Magnesian gate, there would be found a paved road leading to the temple. In 1867, he found the road and, following its track, discovered the wall of the temple. He proceeded to excavate the site and, on 31 December 1869, discovered the temple buried beneath 20 feet of sand. Sadly, the temple was no more than wreckage, but Wood managed to recover a quantity of shattered sculptures and architectural items to be sent to the British Museum. In 1874, his health was as devastated as the debris of the temple site. He had endured fever, bandits, earthquakes, and injuries and endured summer heat and cold winters. He returned to London and spent his remaining years giving occasional lectures to the Royal Institution and publishing Discoveries at Ephesus. In his spare time he painted in oils and occasionally exhibited at the Royal Academy. Wood was lionised as the discoverer of Ephesus. In 1874, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and in 1875 as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. The British government awarded him a pension of ¬£200 per annum in recognition of his discoveries. Wood died on 25 March 1890 aged 69, at his home at 66 Marine Parade, Worthing, Sussex, and was buried at Christ Church, Worthing in Worthing.

This article will lay out all the characters contained in this universe, and categorize them into the type of character they are in the series. Main characters = Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo = is the main protagonist and title character. Bo-bobo is an eccentric man with bodybuilder sized muscles and a giant yellow afro. He fights the forces of evil using his nose hair calling it his \\"Fist of the Nose Hair\\" and \\"Snot Fo-You\\" technique. He is 27 years old. It is unclear what race he is, or if he is even human. It was never fully explained in the show. His father was a hair ball like creature. His birthday differs between the manga and the anime; the manga lists his birthday as April 1, while the anime claims his birthday to be March 14. His most striking features are his large blond afro and sunglasses. Bo-bobo's full name written in kanji is \\"ÊØçÊØçÊØç„ÉºÊØç„ÉªÊØç„ÉºÊØçÊØç\\". Bo-bobo closely resembles the Japanese stereotype of an American from the 70's era. = Beauty = is the female heroine of Bo-bobo's group and usually the only girl when Torpedo Girl or Suzu are not around. A stereotypical teenage manga heroine, she is one of the few sane characters who is the first to join Bo-bobo and was the only citizen to still have hair after the attack of the town she lived in. She initially wanted to join Bo-bobo because she sought a life of adventure. Bo-bobo let her join him, but rejected Pickles stating that he didn't like him, at the same time. She has loving feelings for Gasser after he rescued her, but doesn't say anything about them. She is often exasperated by Bo- bobo's odd behavior or the behavior or actions of others, usually with the same face. She's the only person in the group that doesn't fight, but still criticizes the others' fighting styles. There are a few rare occurrences where she was forced to fight to defend herself, but it's only when Bo-bobo isn't around to protect her and at the last minute someone would come and save her. Beauty worries about her friends' safety and finds them as her own family and though finds Bo-bobo crazy she idolizes him greatly. She seems to be a random girl who joins Bo-bobo's group till Softon is \\"revealed\\" to be her brother; inferring that she may have powers of her own or is descended from a powerful bloodline. By the end of the series, she is traveling the world with Heppokomaru/Gasser. =Don Patch= Don Patch (È¶ñÈ†ò„Éë„ÉÉ„ÉÅ Don Pacchi) (Poppa Rocks in the English manga) is the original leader (or \\"don\\") of the \\"Wiggin Tribe\\" (\\"Hajikegumi\\" in Japan), a group of rebels who oppose Czar Baldy Bald IV. Don Patch has henchmen named Lil' Rocks (in the English manga), or Ko Patch. He quits the Wiggin Gang claiming that they never gave him space, but really so he could wig out more with Bo-bobo. He is extremely narcissistic, and demands to be the center of attention; this leads him to hold a grudge against Beauty believing he should be the \\"heroine\\" of the show. Don Patch also has a wide variety of personas that he switches into, including a female one named \\"Patches.\\" =Gasser= \\\\- Gasser is the quiet but sensible teenage hero of Bo-bobo's group. He has short, spiky white hair with short bangs and Yellow/Gold eyes and also has gold earrings. Gasser is tall and weighs . The \\"heppoko\\" in his Japanese name means \\"untrained\\", while \\"maru\\" is a common name suffix for a samurai or other type of warrior. He uses \\"True Fart Fist\\" (Onara Shinken) as his martial art style, known in the English dub as \\"The Fist of The Back Wind\\". After his hometown, PuuPuu City, was destroyed by Captain Battleship and his Hair Hunt troopers, Gasser began secretly following Bo-bobo, whom he hoped would help get his revenge on Battleship, briefly breaking from his trail to literally save the hair of a kidnapped Beauty. Gasser followed them to C-Block Base where he once again saved Beauty, and after Wall Man's defeat joined the team, but he rarely is seen fighting. He is actually mostly seen punching someone. When the collar around his neck is removed, his Fist's power increases dramatically, but his personality reverts to that of an infant. He is another \\"sane\\" person among the group like Beauty, though he sometimes joins Bo-bobo in his antics or acts oddly on his own. Also like Beauty, he admires Bo-bobo from the sidelines and refers to him as \\"Mr. Bo-bobo\\". Like Beauty, Gasser gets shocked if someone does something stupid. =Jelly Jiggler= Jelly Jiggler, known in the Japanese versions as the captain of the A Block division of Hair Hunters (or \\"Hair Hunter Troop A\\") also uses the fighting style \\"Shivering True Fist\\" (Purupuru Shinken). In the English dub, it is known as the \\"Fist of the Wobble-Wobble\\" and in the English manga, it is called \\"Shakey-Shake Fist\\". By the time he officially joins Bo- bobo's team, he possesses a handkerchief with the Japanese hiragana for \\"Nu\\" („Å¨) written all over it („Å¨„ÅÆ„Éè„É≥„Ç´„ÉÅ Nu no hankachi, the \\"handkerchief of 'nu'\\", known in English dub as \\"the Lucky Hanky\\" ) which he uses to wipe away tears at first, but eventually leads to an all-out \\"nu\\" obsession (By contrast he utterly despises the hiragana character \\"ne\\" [„Å≠]!) He's used as a shield by Bo-bobo constantly, but always bounces back (due to his ability to regenerate himself). His Japanese name is a pun on \\"tokoroten\\", a type of jelly made from agar,Shonen Jump #77. Volume 7, Issue 5. May 2009. VIZ Media. 124. thus his ability to shape himself into any form. Secondary characters =Softon= is one of a few characters who consistently maintains sane behavior. Softon's head resembles soft serve ice cream (hence his name). He was the guardian of the \\"Jet Black Room\\" of C-Block's \\"Aitsuhage Tower\\". Softon uses \\"Babylon Shinken\\" (in the English dub, he fights by channeling the power of \\"the Goddess Blabs-A-Lot\\"). The shape of his head also resembles the typical manga depiction of feces. In promotional color artwork for the manga, his head is colored brown, whereas in the anime it is colored pink (which is not a U.S. TV edit). It is later revealed that this isn't his real face but a mask used to control his powers (similar to Gasser's collar). In the series, Softon allies with Bo-bobo's team after Beauty is kidnapped, but doesn't officially join until the battle with Halekulani. In many episodes, Softon's \\"poop\\" jokes are directly copied from the manga, but put in the context of ice cream. Later, against Lambada, Softon reveals he was given the power of the Black Sun by J and combines it with Goddess Blabs-A-Lot. In the anime he is shown to have a locket with a picture of a brown haired boy and Beauty (he dismisses it, saying \\"Why do i have this? I don't have any kids\\"). Later, during a battle in the Hair Kingdom against a Blabs-a-Lot assassin, it is finally revealed that he is Beauty's older brother, explaining the connection he consistently has to her. He is also the mascot of an ice cream shop. =Dengakuman= is the \\"cute mascot character\\" of Bo-bobo. The name is connected to \\"Dengaku\\", a snack food consisting of grilled tofu dipped in miso on a stick, which is his favorite food. At one time the little white guy was the head of the Z-Block, the most powerful of the Hair Hunting blocks. His major concerns in life are making people eat dengaku and making as many friends as possible. Though he gains friends, some of them ignore him. Bo-bobo and friends taught Dengakuman the true meaning of friendship and Dengakuman repaid them by saving their lives with Super Dengaku Punch in the OVER arc. Soon he became their friend and joined the team. He is a white super deformed creature with a pointy head with a ball attached to his head and bears a strong resemblance to the Pillsbury Doughboy. His trademark line, \\"We'll / I'll make 'em eat grilled tofu dipped in miso on a stick!\\" is a pun much of the American demographic won't understand, but is still used in the English-language anime nonetheless. Dengakuman can be violent but often he is portrayed as being an extremely weak character. Dengakuman actually claims that he is a dog, but he was only raised by dogs. Dengakuman can fuse with Bo-bobo to create a magical blonde popstar named Denbo; they become Super Denbo-chan if Dengakuman fuses with Super Bo- bobo. =Hatenko= is a member of Don Patch's 'Hajikegumi' gang. A common mistranslation lists him as Don Patch's godson. His name means \\"unprecedented\\" and he wields the \\"Kagi Shinken\\" (\\"Fist of the Key\\"). Like Bo-bobo, he is one of the few survivors from the Kingdom of Hair. He attacks enemies with keys and is obsessed with the courage and actions of his \\"boss\\", Don Patch. (In the English dub, he calls him \\"The Don\\") . Hatenko was first found in the desert after being dumped by Torpedo Girl. He was then rescued by the KoPatches and was brought back to Don Patch (who was frying on a pan). From that moment on, he joined the Wiggin Gang. Before then, Hatenko first met with Torpedo Girl right after betraying the J-Block Base that he once worked with. Hatenko briefly joins Bo-bobo's group, then leaves to migrate with his \\"family\\" to find food at baseball stadiums, but he really left so he could find someone to cure the curse mark OVER gave him. Towards the climax of the series, Hatenko finally confronts Bo-bobo towards his true mission: returning to the Hair Kingdom to put a stop to his own evil brothers: Bababa-ba Ba-baba and 'Bibibi- bi Bi-bibi. While both he and one of Bo-bobo's brothers, Bebebe-be Be-bebe are seemingly killed during the final showdown with Bi-bibi, both of them are seen as ghosts assisting Bo-bobo as he partakes in his final showdown. Revived after the last battle, he decides to go into outer space at the end of Part 1, choosing to continue searching for Ba-baba. =Torpedo Girl= is a powerful, unpredictable force not even Bo-bobo and his Wiggins quite understand when she first appears. Compared to her \\"other half\\" OVER, she is a living female torpedo with human arms and legs. Furthermore, compared to the patient anger held by the human form, she gets annoyed by even the slightest of comments, immediately responding by making her bomb-like body fly towards her opponent and smashing into them with intense force. Even if she explodes, she will reassemble instantly. Unlike Over, she is actually 28 years old. It is unknown why she is 28 and Over is three years younger. Villains =Czar Baldy Bald IV= Tsuru Tsurulina IV („ÉÑ„É´„Éª„ÉÑ„É´„É™„Éº„Éä4‰∏ñ) / Smoothie IV (Viz manga) / Czar Baldy Bald IV (English dub) is the leader of the \\"Chrome Dome Empire\\" („Éû„É´„Éè„Ç≤Â∏ùÂõΩ \\"Maruhage Empire\\", lit. baldshaven empire, though the anime changes this from the \\"Margarita Empire\\" similar to the drink Margarita). His Japanese name is a Japanese onomatopoeia for something slippery. The Fourth seems easily in control of his empire at the start of the series, but he slowly loses his authority as Bo-bobo and his allies take out his forces, from the Hair Hunters to his \\"Four Heavenly Kings\\" to even his prison island of Cyber City. Eventually, he further lost his grip as he was forced by Hair Hunters cryogenically frozen one-hundred years ago to release their leaders to take over this new era. As much as he hated doing this, the Fourth eventually decided this as the only way to keep his hold on power and defeat Bo-bobo. But when even this fell, the Fourth decided to enact his greatest plan: the \\"New Emperor Playoff\\", where all of the most powerful warriors of the empire were gathered together in a battle to determine the next emperor. His plan: let all of his enemies take each other out, allowing for him to regain his grip on power. But what he doesn't expect is Hydrate of the Reverse Maruhage Empire taking over his tourney, using it to become emperor himself! The scared emperor bolts away knowing this, basically abdicating the throne and entering an early retirement alongside Mako-chan and Octopus Carl. Czar Baldy Bald also appears on the dollar bills of Halekulani. He is undoubtedly the weakest of his empire shown as a cowardly strategist and was the primary villain until the Reverse Maruhage Empire (Shadow Chrome Dome Empire) arc. He is 42 yrs. old. =Captain Battleship= Captain Battleship (ËªçËâ¶ Gunkan) is the first of the Chrome Dome Empire Big Four, under Czar Baldy-Bald. He is also Bo-bobo's former friend and sworn rival. This regent-haired, white bearded fighter had also been trained in the Fist of the Nose Hair alongside Bo-bobo in the Hair Kingdom, but turned against his afro-haired friend when Bo-bobo was chosen as the Seventh Master of the Fist of the Nose Hair by their teacher (a juice can). Bo-bobo was chosen over Battleship because Captain Battleship was not a citizen of the Hair Kingdom. Captain Battleship controls his vast military forces from the \\"Pomade Ring\\", a sky fortress flying over the destroyed Puppu City (Gasser's hometown). He uses his own style of \\"Fist of the Nosehair\\" as well as fights with weird antics, similarly to Bo-bobo. While most of the attacks are his own, his ultimate attack, \\"Armaggedon\\", has him calling up the Earth Defense Forces to attack for him. He finally falls after trying to apologize to Bo-bobo for abandoning his friend for his own personal gains, only to face Bo-bobo's anger for acting like a baby. The next time Bo-bobo and company saw him, he was being punished for his failure by OVER. He was the first one to discover Beauty and Gasser's feelings for each other, and taunts and exploits Gasser due to it. He participated in the new emperor playoffs but lost and, thanks to Bo-bobo, barely escaped death. It seems that he is the longest lasting of the Chrome Dome Big Four. As a Fist of Nosehair user, he is bound to be a little weird (turning into an octopus, blowing up his own ship, have a bad knowledge of numbers). Like Bo-bobo, he is 27 years old. He inexplicably makes an appearance with the main characters in both the first opening and ending sequence of the anime. =Kittypoo= is a horned cat-faced creature who is also the second of the Chrome Dome Empire Big 4. He fights like the Dragon Ball villain Freeza, to the point of flying around in a craft and mercilessly eliminating his enemies just like the famed manga tyrant. According to him, he's so powerful that even his servants Chocolate Munchie and Lemon Fizz are stronger than Captain Battleship. However, he is easily defeated by Don Patch shortly after he is introduced in both the anime and the manga. He is a participant in the New Emperor Playoffs, and is used as a sacrifice by the Reverse Maruhage. Kittypoo is best described as a reserved tyrant who is very polite despite his lust to kill. He is very strategic, as he learned all of Bo-bobo's weaknesses and strengths. He is the only Heavenly King to have no major arc in the series with his defeat coming between Bo-bobo meeting Hatenko and the blond's invitation to the Evil House of Blood, allowing him to watch his \\"boss\\" Don Patch defeat Kittypoo. His bodyguards include Chocolate Bar, Lemonade Fizz, and Curry. =OVER= is the ruthless third member of Chrome Dome Empire Big 4, the four elite members of Czar Baldy Bald the Fourth's Hair Hunting corp. Unlike many Hair Hunters outside those seen much earlier in the series, OVER takes his job of ripping the hair out of the subjects of the Maruhage Empire extremely seriously and will treat all in his gaze as prey. This harshness for his job includes the treatment of his own teammates, as seen by his scalping of both Gunkan and Kitty Poo after their failures against Bo-bobo and the Hajike rebels. Although OVER can and will attack with little or no notice, he mostly controls his hair hunting activities from an ancient Japanese castle, where he controls a platoon of various ninja-like warriors including The Ultimate Five Assassins, who themselves are known for their stealth and abilities. =Halekulani= is the last and the strongest of Czar Baldy Bald's Chrome Dome Empire Big 4. He is the owner of the Holy Guacamole Land amusement park. His main attack style is the Fist of Gorgeousness. This involves the control and manipulation of all monetary items, from coins to paper money to precious jewels. One of the most devastating of these attacks include wrapping his opponent with paper bills to transform them into what they are worth. He can also send opponents into a world based on the board game sugoroku and power up his \\"Gorgeous Shinken\\"(„Ç¥„Éº„Ç∏„É£„Çπ ÁúüÊã≥ Super Fist of Gorgeousness in the dub) abilities by fusing with the many precious gems he can collect all over his armor. His personality is more realistic then the rest of the Big 4, not making a big deal of the intruders and giving the impression of a bored trillionaire. He even begins to doze off as Bo-bobo and his allies struggle to reach him to fight. He has been shown to be cruel as he told a soldier to make the slaves work harder till they made a millions worth of money. He is obsessed with money, even to the point he can insane saying money repeatedly in a crazed stance. He later becomes a key ally in the fight against the Reverse Maruhage Empire after losing to Crimson and LOVE in the new emperor playoffs. Halekulani mentions he was a man with a difficult choice 20 years ago, a man named Czar Baldy-Bald the 4th decided to help him by giving him what would define his life. During those years, he eventually got bored and left the Empire. Halekulani eventually returned to his boring career as head of Holy Guacamole amusement park and find a future friend in Bo-bobo. Halekulani manipulates his money much like how Gaara from Naruto manipulates his sand, using his own will. He also makes his first appearance bathing in money. =Giga= is the leader of the prison island of Cyber City, the most powerful district of the Bald Empire, and Czar Baldy Bald's right-hand man (though this could be seen as blackmailing). His main ability is the power of \\"Obuje Shinken\\" (Fist of Objects „Ç™„Éñ„Ç∏„Ç® ÁúüÊã≥, dub: \\"Fist of Object D'Art\\"), which allows for the creation of pieces of art that he uses to attack. This ability also allows him to transform enemies, particularly those with \\"Shinken\\" abilities, into art both for his collection and to assist him in powering up upon breaking them. After absorbing many of his creations, he is able to transform into \\"Super Giga\\", which has more powerful armor and much longer pigtailed hair. Bo-bobo finally puts a stop to him with the ultimate powers of \\"Hanage Shinken\\". He is also a participant in the new emperor playoffs, where he is crushed off-screen by Crimson, and he gets beaten by Hiragi in Shinsetsu Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo. He is 34 yrs. old. He is known for his supreme over-confidence to the point that he feels that when he fights that he doesn't even need a super fist. =Czar Baldy Bald the III= Tsuru Tsurulina III („ÉÑ„É´„Éª„ÉÑ„É´„É™„Éº„ÉäÔºì‰∏ñ Tsuru Tsurulina 3-Sei) is the old emperor of the Margarita Empire, locked away within the center of \\"Neo Hair-Hunt Land MAX\\" („Éç„Ç™ÊØõÁã©„Çä„É©„É≥„ÉâMAX, Neo Kegari Rando MAX, an amusement park thrown right on top of the old A-Block Amusement Park). Although he appears to be human, he is actually a demon cyborg. He uses \\"Red Magic Shinken\\" (ÁúüÁ¥Ö„ÅÆÊâãÂìÅÁúüÊã≥ Fist of Red Magic, read as \\"Reddo Majikku Shinken,\\" which creates attacks based on magic tricks) to avoid the attacks of his enemies and attack them back physically, and \\"Blue Magic Shinken\\" (È´òÂûã„ÅÆÊâãÂìÅÁúüÊã≥ Fist of Blue Magic, read as \\"Bur≈´ Majikku Shinken\\", released only within a special universe he creates through a magic handkerchief) to destroy souls and minds. Unlike the current emperor, who wants everyone to be bald, Czar Baldy Bald III wants to destroy all humans and then get the \\"Hair Ball\\", the source of power of the Hair Kingdom which gives them their hair abilities, for himself. He absorbs Bo- bobo, thinking he may be able to obtain it that way, and also absorbs Don Patch (since Bo-bobo wants a travel buddy), eventually changing into a very strange form. Bo-bobo and Don Patch manage to escape from inside him, and then defeat him once and for all with a technique, named the \\"Human Highlife in HD\\", showcasing all the wonderful things about life and being a human (such as getting a job, falling in love, etc.) At the end of \\"Part 1\\", Czar Baldy Bald the 3rd finally gains a \\"Hair Ball\\" and takes advantage of a vacuum in power, becoming emperor and declaring this land as the \\"Neo Maruhage Empire.\\" After many trials and tribulations, Bo-bobo's team faces him one final time at his headquarters: the Shueisha building in his final battleground of \\"Tokyo's 23rd Ward\\". Although still fighting with the power of the \\"Red Magic Shinken\\", he was now more powerful both with the combination of a Hair Ball, his eventual successor, Tsuru Tsurulina the Fifth (Yononaka Namer≈ç)! After a long and drawn out battle with Bo-bobo and his allies giving everything they've got to stop him and his protege, he ends up taking several ultimate attacks culminating with Bo-bobo smashing him with \\"a weak arm chop\\", finally destroying him once and for all. His final words were in celebration of the Chrome Dome Empire he had created and how others will still rise to fight against Bo-bobo and his rebels. Others * : ::The mad leader of the Reverse Chrome Dome Empire that exists underground beneath the castle of the real Maruhage Empire. In actuality, Hydrate is also the little brother of Czar Baldy Bald the Fourth, forced into the shadows due to his brother becoming the emperor of the country. He is 38 yrs old. On the sidenote, he is the last seen enemy at the end of the anime. * ::Bibibi-bi Bi-bibi is the second child of the Five Hair Siblings (older brother to Bu-bubu, Be-bebe and Bo-bobo, but younger than Ba- baba). He is the leader of the \\"New Hair Kingdom\\" and the final opponent of the first part of the Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo manga. Although he is the second child, he is the master of the most powerful of the five hair-based Shinken: \\"Kami no Ge Shinken\\" (Fist of Head Hair), allowing him the control of the hair of his head and the ability to stop other hair abilities such as nosehair or leghair. * : :: A teen assassin encountered on the top floor of Wiggin Block, he is defeated by Bo-bobo's \\"Pineapple Custard Pudding\\". He later assists in the battle against the former Hair Hunters, where he is defeated again by Lambada. * : :: The Maruhage Empire's strongest executive. Initially appearing as a serious older man in a kimono, this warrior becomes Bo-bobo's main opponent in the death battle arena \\"Bottle Age\\" (filled with giant water bottles) in the first true stage of the journey to Chromedome Castle. Manipulating \\"Dokuro Shinken\\" („Éâ„ÇØ„É≠ÁúüÊã≥Fist of Skulls), he has various abilities including the ability to create fighting skeletons, manipulate a skull sword or place a special seal that forces an opponent's bones out of their body. Furthermore, he can further transform into a demonic form using a special \\"Skull Sake\\". His name was never said in the English anime. * : June 7 : Tough-Looking Guy ::The five elite warriors of Gunkan's forces (who occasionally number in six), all of them remain hidden under cloaks and masks until the moment each one goes into battle. When Bo-bobo's team infiltrate the Pomade Ring, they must fight each one one-on-one based on the warp panel chosen (though Gasser almost fights all six at once at one point). Though only two of them lost (only one lost in the manga); they overpowered the rest of the team by stupidity (Loincloth Lloyd), obvious size difference (Tough- Looking Guy), and better to eat (Gum). Like Bo-bobo, his elite are a bunch of utterly random characters that just happen to appear in the series (for example, a piece of gum, an insanely large man, a calendar, a torn page of a calendar, a muscular man with a cat head, and a Kinnikuman-like boy with a loincloth). * : :: Known as the \\"Messenger of the Black Sun\\", this suited, mustach-wearing man (with a head no one knows whether it is an onion or garlic) controls the power within Cyber City. He is a master of \\"Kurotaiy≈ç Shinken\\" (ÈªíÂ§™ÈôΩÁúüÊã≥ Fist of the Black Sun), allowing him to attack with powerful black suns and illusions created from five black suns created in his field. He appears again during the new emperor playoffs (where Bo-bobo calls him \\"Q\\" for some odd reason), but loses early on to Menma. Out of all the many ridiculous villains in Cyber city, J seems to be the most serious and he can be rather cruel in battle. It is unknown wheteher J's name stands for anything. His weird head and godlike powers make him Softon's dark counterpart. * : Halon Oni : Maloney Oni :: A boy with a demonic tail who is a member of the Reverse Cromedome Empire, as well as part of their Cromedome Big Four. He has an uncanny resemblance to Gasser in appearance. His main ability is \\"Sword Yamiken\\" (Dark Fist of Swords), which allows him to summon swords of various sizes at will. Initially, Halon works with a penguin-like creature called Slim, but eventually betrays him. He has a demonic tail that can vastly increase the size of his opponents, which he uses to puncture Gasser, turning him into a giant battlefield stuck in the ground until his collar comes off (due to DonPatch taking it off) and he goes into baby mode. After being annihilated by Baby Gasser, he upgrades himself into a more demonic form with wings and an immense sword. * : :: A three-eyed member of the Reverse Maruhage Empire's Four Heavenly Kings, he is first implied by defeating Giga effortlessly offscreen during the New Emperor Playoffs. He is also the first opponent faced by the allies of Bo-bobo heading up through Hydrate's floating fortress. Crimson uses his abilities of \\"Mitsume Yamiken\\" (Dark Fist of Three Eyes) to create giant floating eyeballs to perform various tasks, mostly for offensive purposes (like firing lasers) and looking over his arena. As guardian of the first level of Hydrate's fortress, he controls the \\"Cinematic Hour\\" stage, forcing his opponents (in this case Bo-bobo, Tennosuke and Halekulani) to take part in various life-or-death movie scenarios. * : :: Though she appears like a normal woman, she reveals that she is a dominatrix when it came time for battle and the last of the Reverse Chrome Dome Big 4. She also loves men with big muscles so she has a factory that runs on a conveyor belt that gives men bulging muscles. She attacks by the power of Oiroke Yamiken (Dark Fist of Sexy), which includes fighting with a whip as well as blowing kisses and smooching the opponents. Her actions (as well Tennosuke, unintentionally) transforms OVER back into Torpedo Girl, making her much harder to stop and forcing LOVE to transform into an immense bird creature. She reverts to her normal form, only to be killed by Don Patch. * : :: The guardian of the fourth floor \\"Moon Sati-Field ZO\\", he seems like a cool-appearing male consistently in black and smoking, but while Bo-bobo's favorite sibling in his youth, he was abducted by Hydrate twenty years prior and brainwashed to work for the Reverse Maruhage Empire. * :: The eldest of the five children of hair. Although merely mentioned and never appearing in the series, he is believed to have an evil aura just like Bibibi-bi Bi-bibi. Due to a process of elimination regarding the \\"five hairs\\", it is believed he would be the master of \\"Munage Shinken\\" (Fist of Chesthair). Early in the arc, we see him talking with younger brother Bi-bibi and it does seem he does have a bit of control of the actions in the Hair Kingdom. At the end of Part 1, Hatenko decides to go into outer space in search of Ba-baba. Outside of his Hair Kingdom cameo, he remains unseen throughout the entire series. * :: The leader both of \\"East Bodysoap Tower\\" battle arena and the 1st District of the Hair Kingdom. He first appears as a yellow, Don Patch-like being who believes in the philosophy of Shigeki, like Don Patch believes in his Hajike skills and abilities. One of these attacks, an X-shaped dimension, is used to trap Bo- bobo and Don Patch and force them to absorb the true power of Shigeki.

High School Leaving Certificate (HSLC) is the award given through the authority of this board to students who have passed the HSLC examination successfully. History The Assam Secondary Education Act, 1961 (Assam Act, XXV of 1961) was passed to provide for the establishment of a Board of Secondary Education to regulate, supervise and develop Secondary Education in the State of Assam.

Thus the Board of Secondary Education, Assam (popularly known as SEBA) came into existence on 14 March 1962. It started functioning with the conduct of 11 year H.S.S.L.C. Examination of 1962. Under the provisions of the Act the Govt. of Assam constituted the Board with Sri S.C. Rajkhowa, D.P.I., Assam as Chairman and Md. N. Islam, Inspector of Schools (Central Assam Circle) as Secretary. =Accommodation= The Board was first accommodated in the Conference Room of the office of D.P.I., Assam at Shillong. It was shifted to a rented house at Rehabari (Guwahati). The Board functioned here from 1/6/1962 to 26/2/1963. The Board office was then shifted to old University Campus of Gauhati University, Panbazar (the then New Hostel campus of Cotton College) where it functioned from 27/2/1963 to 15/01/1976. A part of the office functioned at Bhagawati Prasad Baruah Bhawan which housed the Chairman, the Education Officers and the Evaluation Unit during 1965-66. The Board office was shifted to the Assam type building constructed on its own premises at Bamunimaidan, Guwahati-21 on 16 January 1976. On this occasion the opening ceremony was held with Sri H.N. Talukdar p(Hon‚Äôble Education Minister of Assam) in the chair and Sri Sarat Chandra Sinha, Hon‚Äôble Chief Minister of Assam as chief-guest. The present site comprising 6 bighas of land was allotted by the Government of Assam to the Board in 1965. The then Education Minister, Sri D.K. Barooah allotted these 6 bighas to the Board on 99 years‚Äô lease. The lease was executed by the Board by paying Rs.1 (one) lakh as advance rent for the entire period. The present multi-storeyed building (plinth area 1575 sq. metres) constructed by the side of the Assam type building was completed in 1989. ... Jurisdiction of the Board The jurisdiction of SEBA was the territory of the erstwhile State of Assam comprising the entire North East region of the country. With the creation of the Provinces/States Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh out of Assam at different times and with the establishment of their separate/own Boards of School Education, the jurisdiction of SEBA got reduced. Presently the territory of the State of Assam is the jurisdiction of the Board.

They are considered one of the most important modernist architectural firms in post-war England.  Formation  The practice was founded in 1952 by Geoffry Powell (1920‚Äì1999), Peter \\"Joe\\" Chamberlin (1919‚Äì1978) and Christoph Bon (1921‚Äì1999), following Powell's win in the 1951 architectural competition for the Golden Lane Estate. The three founding partners taught at Kingston Polytechnic (now Kingston University School of Architecture) when they each entered the design competition with the agreement that should any of them win they would form a partnership with the other two to deliver the project. The Golden Lane Estate is sometimes referred to as the apprentice piece of the practice and is important for its planned landscape which 'straddles the boundary between the picturesque and the formal'. Charles Greenberg became an additional partner of the practice in 1960, although he chose not to add his name to the partnership for personal reasons. He was the only other partner working with CP&B; on Barbican. Frank Woods also became an additional partner, and in 1985 the firm name became Chamberlin Powell Bon & Woods.Barbican Living: Chamberlin Powell and Bon , Barbican Living The firm continued to 1989. Its records are archived at the Royal Institute of British Architects.  Main work  Following completion of the Golden Lane Estate, they won the commission to design and execute the adjacent Barbican development, also for the Corporation of the City of London, the wealthy municipal administration that has responsibility for the historic core of London, today its central financial district. The Barbican was such a large job they set up a sub-practice to deal with it: Chamberlin Powell and Bon (Barbican) Ltd. The firm was strongly influenced by the work and ideas of Swiss/French architect Le Corbusier, with the essence of the innovative design being encapsulated by the project architect Leopold Rubinstein who trained with Le Corbusier in Paris. It is a measure of the importance of the practice in post-war British architecture that many of their works are now Listed Buildings.

The band was at the forefront of the modernization of the traditional luohti of the Saami living along the Teno, when they started to incorporate Western musical elements such as pop and disco into the traditional luohti. Their entire repertoire is in Northern Saami and is still an integral part of the play lists on Saami radio stations today. History Jiella's history starts in the mid 1990s when Niilo Rasmus formed a group with his two of his four daughters, Eeva-Liisa and Jenna. In 1999, they sang the songs their father had written and composed for the first time together in public. At that point in time, the band was known as Niilo ja nieiddat (Niilo and his daughters). In 1999, the band's name changed to Jiella, which means a gentle breeze in Northern Saami. At this point in time a third sister, Mia, joined the group. At the Saami Easter celebrations in 2002, Jiella participated in the singing category of the S√°mi Grand Prix with the song ƒåeavli (Arrogance) Later on that year, in December, Jiella's first album Gosnu (Somewhere) was released. This is the only album that Mia Rasmus sings on. Songs from this album were heavily played on Saami radio stations across Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. Four years later, on July 8, 2006, their second album, Eallinb√°lg√°t (Life's paths), was released. While the majority of the songs on this album were written and composed by Niilo Rasmus, the yoik Ol√°t was written together with Ilmari Rasmus and the songs Amma eal√°t f√°molaƒçƒçat, Dovddatgo ruonas h√°ja, and ƒåakƒçamodji s√°niid were written by Saami poet Inger-Mari Aikio-Arianaick. The same year, Aikio-Arianaick made a short documentary film about the band called D√°lvem√°ilmmi bivut or S√°mi winter clothing. In addition to their own albums, Jiella has also performed on the album of the 2002 S√°mi Grand Prix and Inger- Mari Aikio-Arianaick's album of children's songs called Ima ipma≈°at - m√°n√°idl√°vlagat from 2007.

Joseph ibn Naghrela Joseph ibn Naghrela, or Joseph ha-Nagid ( Ribbi Yehosef ben Shemu'el ha-Lewi ha-Nagid; Abu Hussein bin Naghrela) (15 September 1035In his preface to one of his father's collections of Hebrew poetry, Joseph gives his precise date and time of birth as Monday evening, the evening preceding the 11th of Tishrei 4796 AM, corresponding to the 11th of Dhu al-Qi'dah 426 AH, at 3 hours 56 minutes into the evening. (Diwan of Shemuel Hannaghid, ed. David S. Sassoon (London: Oxford University Press, 1934), p. ◊ê.) ‚Äì 30 December 1066), was a vizier to the Berber taifa king Badis al-Muzaffar of Granada, during the Moorish rule of Al-Andalus, and the nagrid, or leader of the Iberian Jews. =Life and career= Joseph was born in Granada, the eldest son of Rabbi and famous poet and warrior Sh'muel ha-Nagid. Some information about his childhood and upbringing is preserved in the collection of his father's Hebrew poetry in which Joseph writes that he began copying at the age of eight and a half. For example, he tells how once (at nine and a half, in the spring of 1045) he accompanied his father to the battlefield, only to suffer from severe homesickness, about which he wrote a short poem.Diwan of Shemuel Hannaghid, ed. David S. Sassoon (London: Oxford University Press, 1934, page ◊°◊ë His primary school teacher was his father. On the basis of a letter to Rabbi Nissim Gaon attributed to him,Published in Otzar Tov, 1881‚Äì82, pp. 45ff. in which Joseph refers to himself as R' Nissim's disciple, it is possible to infer that he also studied under R' Nissim at Kairouan.Diwan, p. xxiii. In 1049, Joseph married Rabbi Nissim's daughter. After the death of his father, Joseph succeeded him as vizier and rabbi, directing at the same time an important yeshiva. Among his students were Rabbi Isaac ben Baruch ibn Albalia and Rabbi Isaac ibn Ghayyat. When the King, Badis and his heir Bulluggin, were poisoned and died in 1073, it was loudly rumored that Joseph had done it himself. Things only worsened for him from there. He launched into a series of backfired intrigues, mishandled and misjudged situations, resulting in the kingdom sliding into crisis. =Character= Rabbi Abraham ibn Daud describes Joseph in highly laudatory terms, saying that he lacked none of his father's good qualities, except that he was not quite as humble, having been brought up in luxury.Sefer ha-Kabbalah (), p. 73. The 1906 edition of the Jewish Encyclopedia states, \\"Arabic chroniclers relate that he believed neither in the faith of his fathers nor in any other faith. It may also be doubted that he openly declared the principles of Islam to be absurd.\\"Dozy, \\"Geschichte der Mauren in Spanien,\\" ii. 301 Arabic poets also praised his liberality.Nagdela (Nagrela), Abu Husain Joseph Ibn by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, Jewish Encyclopedia. 1906 ed. The Jewish Encyclopedia also reported that Joseph \\"completely ruled King Badis, who was nearly always drunk, and surrounded him with spies\\". Muslim leaders accused him of several acts of violence, which drew upon him the hatred of the Berbers, the ruling majority at Granada. The most bitter among his many enemies was Abu Ishak of Elvira, who hoped to obtain an office at court and wrote a malicious poem against Joseph and his fellow Jews. The poem made little impression upon the king, who trusted Joseph implicitly, but it created a great sensation among the Berbers. Massacre In hopes of attaining his father's dream, Joseph sent messengers to the ruler of the neighboring kingdom of Almeria, Ibn Sumadih, a traditional enemy of Granada. He promised to open the gates of the city to the king's army, if he promised to install Joseph as king in exchange for his submission and allegiance. At the last moment Ibn Sumadih pulled out, and on the eve of the supposed invasion, word of the plot got out. When word reached the populace, people claimed he killed the king and was about to betray the kingdom. On 30 December 1066 (9 Tevet 4827), Muslim mobs stormed the royal palace where Joseph had sought refuge, captured, then crucified him. In the ensuing massacre of the Jewish population, many of the Jews of Granada were murdered. The 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia claims, \\"More than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day.\\"Granada by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, Jewish Encyclopedia. 1906 ed. However, the 1971 edition does not give precise casualty figures.1971 Jewish Encyclopedia This was possibly because the accounts of the massacre couldn't be verified, and as over 900 years had passed, it was subject to hyperbole. The Encyclopaedia Judaica also confirms the figures : ¬´According to a later testimony,Solomon ibn Verga, Shevet Yehudah, ed. A. Shochat (1947), p. 22. \\"more than 1,500 householders\\" were killed. ¬ªEncyclopaedia Judaica, 2007, vol. 8, p. 32. Joseph's wife fled to Lucena with her son Azariah, where she was supported by the community. Azariah, however, died in early youth. According to historian Bernard Lewis, the massacre is \\"usually ascribed to a reaction among the Muslim population against a powerful and ostentatious Jewish vizier.\\" Lewis writes: > Particularly instructive in this respect is an ancient anti-Jewish poem of > Abu Ishaq, written in Granada in 1066. This poem, which is said to be > instrumental in provoking the anti-Jewish outbreak of that year, contains > these specific lines: :Do not consider it a breach of faith to kill them, > the breach of faith would be to let them carry on. :They have violated our > covenant with them, so how can you be held guilty against the violators? > :How can they have any pact when we are obscure and they are prominent? :Now > we are humble, beside them, as if we were wrong and they were right! Lewis continues: \\"Diatribes such as Abu Ishaq's and massacres such as that in Granada in 1066 are of rare occurrence in Islamic history.\\" The episode has been characterized as a pogrom. Walter Laqueur writes, \\"Jews could not as a rule attain public office (as usual there were exceptions), and there were occasional pogroms, such as in Granada in 1066.\\" Erika Spivakovsky questions the death rate, suspecting it to be an example of \\"the usual hyperbole in numerical estimates, with which history abounds.\\" See also *Timeline of Jewish History *Timeline of antisemitism *List of massacres in Spain  Sources and further reading  * Constable, Olivia Remie, Medieval Iberia: Readings from Christian, Muslim, and Jewish Sources.

AA roads. It is partially unsigned from the southern terminus to SR 482. Route description Starting at its northern terminus with an intersection of Fairbanks Avenue in Winter Park area it is called Orlando Avenue, yet as soon as it crosses the Orange Blossom Trail, throughout most of its length it is better known as Orange Avenue. As a state road, the route travels through a heavily urbanized area of Orlando (passing right smack down the Downtown Orlando) and its suburbs. In Downtown it splits with its northbound segment from Lake Lucerne to Lake Ivanhoe travels along Rosalind Avenue and Magnolia Avenue, while its southbound travels through the Downtown along Orange Avenue. =County Road 527= at Sand Lake Road where SR 527 terminates, Orange Avenue continues on as County Road 527 (Orange County). As such it travels all the way to Osceola Parkway which is located in Osceola County. The route crosses a county line just before the intersection after it crosses the overpass over FL-91 (Florida Turnpike) and continues south now as CR 527 (Osceola County). The route breaks off at Osceola Parkway and resumes about a block westward down Osceola Parkway as Old Dixie Highway in Osceola County. The southern terminus of CR 527 is with an intersection of Donegan Avenue in Kissimmee. There is a connecting street which extends the route to Orange Blossom Trail in Kissimmee. =Passing locations and points of interest= Along the entire route, the places passed are Meadow Woods, Southchase, Taft, Belle Isle, Pine Castle, Edgewood, Orlando, and Winter Park. In Downtown Orlando, it is one of the 2 state roads that border Lake Eola, the other being SR 526. History SR 3A was defined by number in 1935 state law, chapter 17341, approved May 27, 1935: * A certain road described as extending from the intersection of Orange Avenue and Fairbanks Avenue in Winter Park, then Southerly on Orange Avenue to its intersection with State Road 22 in the City of Orlando. This was established to keep this section of former SR 3, which was to be bypassed around 1937 along the Orlando Shortcut (now Orlando Avenue) and Mills Avenue, a state road (and probably part of US 17/US 92). South of SR 22 (Colonial Drive), Orange Avenue was still part of SR 2. SR 3A was extended in both directions by number in 1939 state law chapter 19049, approved May 12, 1939: * Beginning at the point where the new location of State Road No. 3 intersects with the old location near the south line of the Town of Lake Maitland, thence along said old location thereof and along Park, Fairbanks and Orange Avenue in Winter Park, Orange Avenue in Orlando, and such route as may be selected by the State Road Department from Orange Avenue to Kuhl Avenue in Orlando, to the South city limits thereof, thence along the present Orlando and Kissimmee road to the county-line between Orange and Osceola Counties. This kept the rest of old SR 3 in Winter Park in the State Road system, as well as old SR 2 south of SR 22 (Colonial Drive), which was bypassed around 1939. Some state maps show SR 3A on old SR 2 north of Kissimmee in Osceola County and through Maitland into Seminole County, but it doesn't appear that these were added, unless they were added in 1941 when most of the through roads in Orange County were designated as State Roads. In the 1945 renumbering, most of SR 3A became SR 527; SR 527 extended south into Osceola County but not north to Seminole County. The part between Orlando Avenue and the Park Avenue/Fairbanks Avenue intersection in Winter Park instead became part of SR 426, and was a gap in SR 527.

History The Israel Bar is organized as a corporation, with a Central Committee, a National Assembly and five districts. Membership is mandatory for lawyers licensed in Israel. The top positions are filled by elections held every four years. The president from July 2007 to July 2011 was Yori Geiron of the law firm Geraldson, Marks And Xeno. The Israel Bar Association was established in 1961 as an autonomous statutory entity that assures the standard and integrity of the legal profession in Israel. The law empowers the Israel bar with mandatory authority to regulate ethical and disciplinary matters, to accredit interns, conduct the Bar examination twice a year, and issue licenses. As a matter of discretionary authority, the law empowers the Israel Bar to take actions for the benefit of its members, and to take legal actions against those trespassing on the profession. It is considered a self-regulated \\"guild\\", created under the concept that lawyers are better equipped to discipline themselves without government or judicial supervision. This is contrary to the United States, where lawyers must seek admission from the Courts in each State they wish to practice, and obtain additional separate licenses from Federal Courts. Membership in the Israel Bar is compulsory, and it is the only bar recognized under the law. Under the umbrella of the Israel Bar different committees devoted to almost every imaginable aspect of the law convene on a voluntary basis. Those committees, however, have very limited role in the daily practice of attorney, and have minimal influence in the process of drafting and passing laws.

In 1614, it was recorded that Alfalu had 104 families. In 1724, it was already mentioned as Gyergy√≥ Alfalu. Its Romanian name was AlfalƒÉu until 1919 Transylvanian Toponym Book and was derived from the Hungarian form. In 1567, it was the local priest Stephen who mobilized the Sz√©kelys against king John Sigismund who attempted to force Roman Catholic Sz√©kelys to convert to Protestantism. In memory of the role that the village played in the Sz√©kely resistance, pilgrims from the village lead the procession on occasion of the yearly Cs√≠ksomly√≥ pilgrimages. The villages belonged first to the Sz√©kely seat of Gyergy√≥sz√©k, which was subsequently absorbed into Cs√≠ksz√©k district, until the administrative reform of Transylvania in 1876, when they fell within Cs√≠k County in the Kingdom of Hungary. After the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, they became part of Romania and fell within Ciuc County during the interwar period. In 1940, the second Vienna Award granted the Northern Transylvania to Hungary and the villages were held by Hungary until 1944. After Soviet occupation, the Romanian administration returned and the commune became officially part of Romania in 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, the commune fell within the Hungarian Autonomous Province, between 1960 and 1968 the Mure»ô-Hungarian Autonomous Province. In 1968, the province was abolished, and since then, the commune has been part of Harghita County Demographics The commune has an absolute Sz√©kely (Hungarian) majority. According to the 2011 census it has a population of 5,475; of which 98.17% or 5,375 are ethnic Hungarians. Landmarks The Roman Catholic Church was built in the honour of Saint Simon the Zealot, Saint Judas Thaddaeus and Margaret the Virgin. It probably dates to the 13th century as its stone gate bears the number 1213. At the right hand-side from its entrance, a flagpole base can be seen which was raised in 1942 by villagers living in Budapest. Its inscriptions reads: Man, think in thy heart that this land has always been and always will be Sz√©kely Land.

Local children gather around the local St Nicholas kirk where at 6 pm the wee bell is rung. This is the starting sign for the children to run around the church in a clockwise direction, making noise and swinging paper balls on strings above their heads as they run. It is no longer a race for safety reasons (also gives full names of Newsround reporters) and to increase fairness for the younger participants. After three laps, they scramble for coins thrown by members of the Community Council who host the event. The Community Council also hosts a \\"Whuppity Scoorie Storytelling Festival\\" and art workshops after the event until 7 March. Origins While the origins of Whuppity Scoorie are unknown, there are several theories which try to explain how the ancient custom evolved. The most common theory is that Whuppity Scoorie came from a festival that was intended to celebrate spring and frighten off winter or evil spirits. Others believe it marks the time when days got longer allowing curfews to be lifted or changed so children could play outside longer. Another theory connects the event with an ancient religious penance in which the penitents were whipped three times round the church and afterwards \\"scoored\\" ‚Äì washed ‚Äì in the nearby River Clyde, but the burgh and kirk session records make no mention of such punishments. The celebration could also have been instituted to remember the murder of William Wallace's wife. The tradition was first mentioned in a local newspaper, The Hamilton Advertiser, around the mid-19th century. It was still called the \\"wee bell ceremony\\" suggesting a link with the ringing of the church bell. In 1893, the Advertiser first referred to \\"the custom known as Whuppity Scoorie\\" which simply became \\"Whuppity Scoorie\\" the next year. The three laps around the church were also first mentioned in 1893, although the writer claimed this custom was 120 years old by then. The Advertiser also reported on how the local boys in those days rolled up their caps and tied them with string. After the bell rang, they would march to New Lanark where they would fight the boys coming in the opposite direction. By 1880, it was not uncommon for stones to be thrown, so the police posted men along the road between the villages to keep order.

It could also be translated as \\"Blessed Calves\\".) is a parish in the Barony of Tyrawley, County Mayo, Ireland. Moygownagh borders the parishes of Kilfian, and Crossmolina. The parish is on the R315 Crossmolina to Ballycastle road. A modern community centre acts as a meeting place and sporting venue in the area.And great school History The story of how the parish got its name is told in the 7th century Life of St. Cormac, taken from McFirbis. It relates how St. Cormac while on a journey, came to the place called Moygownagh, where he met St. Daria who was abbess of a nunnery there. She received him so hospitably that on his departure he blessed her and her place of habitation, and prayed that Moygownagh would abound in cows and herds. His prayers were answered, and from then on the place was known as Mag Gamhnach, which means 'Plain of the cows with calves'. Although the feast of St. Daire falls on 26 October, there is no monument in the parish erected in her honour. St. Cormac, however, gives his name to the church. It is thought that St. Daire's Convent was situated where the old cemetery now stands. In ancient times, Moygownagh, most of Kilfian and a small part of Crossmolina formed the territory known as Bredach. It would appear that long before the coming of the Welsh Normans in the 13th century, or the formation of the present parish, this district of Bredach formed a unit of ecclesiastical as well as of civil administration. There was a Protestant church near Garranard Post Office which itself was the parson's residence. The stones remaining in the old Protestant church were used by Patrick Quinn in the foundation of the present parochial house when he was building it. The present church was built in 1846 by Father James McNamera. It is situated in Ardvarney townland, once owned by a landlord called Stackpole.

Extract from Samuel Lewis' 'Topographical Survey of Mayo', published in 1837 Moygownagh Church Samuel Lewis, writing in 1836, spoke of the \\"R.C. Chapel in Magaunagh\\" as being \\"small and in bad repair\\". This church stood on the road-side about halfway between the present church gate and Mitchells shop. A holy water stoup belonging to this church was preserved beside it for many years. The present church was built in 1846 and it is situated in Ardvarney townland. The Griffith Valuation (1856) records that the \\"R.C. chapel and yard\\" were leased from Andrew Brown, being 5 roods in area and having a valuation of ¬£15-15-0, but exempt from taxes or rates. Carn National School There was a stone placed over the entrance of the church which bore the following inscription: \\"This is the house of God and Gate of Heaven. Erected to the greater glory of God, A.D. 1846\\". After a porch was erected about 1937, this stone became hidden from view. It was removed in 1973 and inserted in the wall near the priest's graves. Extensive reconstruction and alteration works were carried out at this time also by Fr. Michael Gilroy. The reason for the porch being erected in 1937 was that the door faced the prevailing wind and around that time a severe storm blew in the door and damaged the roof. There is a relatively new graveyard behind Moygownagh church (in the centre of the town). The old Moygownagh cemetery is about half a mile south-west of Moygownagh town. The short driveway to the cemetery is on the west side of the Crossmolina road behind iron gates. An indexed catalogue of headstone photos from both graveyards is posted on-line on the \\"Family History in Ballycastle\\" web site at http://goldenlangan.com/headstones.html. Festivals =Mayo Mud Run= Mayo Mud Run is an annual event held in Moygownagh to fund-raise and help with the upkeep of the local community centre. It is an 8.5 km mud- running event. Glenmore House Glenmore House in the parish of Moygownagh was known locally as the 'Big House' or the Landlords house. It was built in 1790 with the stones quarried from the nearby wood,. It was owned at the time by William Knox Orme. In 1853, the house and lands were purchased by Fetherstonehaugh. He remained as Landlord until 1930. During this time, the Land Commission allotted most of the lands to the tenants. Major Aldridge bought the house and remaining lands in 1930. In 1931, the land in Attyshane was divided among the local people but there was still about , including woodlands in the estate. When Major Aldridge sold the estate, he moved to Mount Falcon, near Ballina. He had a great interest in local history and he collected information and stories for the Folklore Commission. After Major Aldridge came Mr. Brennan, Mr Hegarty, Captain Hunt, Mr. Latta, Sir John Riss and Mr Somers. Mr Somers sold the estate to Dr. Loftus in 1978. He owned it during his term as President of the G.A.A. Dr. Loftus sold the house and lands to a Mr. Begot in 1989. During Fetherstonehaugh's time, there were fourteen men, three housemaids and a cook working in the house. The wages at the time were 5p per day There was a holy well situated in the vicinity of the Big House. Many people came to pray at the well. Folklore has it that the landlord was displeased with the practice and the steward ordered the workers to fill the well with clay. They refused to obey his order so he took the spade himself and threw in a spadeful of soil. The men then completed the job. The steward became insane shortly afterward.

Zoid can refer to either an asexually reproductive spore or a sexually reproductive gamete. In sexually reproductive gametes, zoids can be either male or female depending on the species. For example, some brown alga (Phaeophyceae) reproduce by producing multi-flagellated male and female gametes that recombine to form the diploid sporangia. Zoids are primarily found in some protists, diatoms, green alga, brown alga, non-vascular plants, and a few vascular plants (ferns, cycads, and Ginkgo biloba). The most common classification group that produces zoids is the heterokonts or stramenopiles. These include green alga, brown alga, oomycetes, and some protists. The term is generally not used to describe motile, flagellated sperm found in animals. Zoid is also commonly confused for zooid which is a single organism that is part of a colonial animal. Diversity of zoids A zoid contains one or more flagella for motility. In the various species that produce zoids, there is a high level of diversity in the number of flagella produced. The heterokonts generally produce zoids with 2 flagella, while the Ginkgo biloba produce zoids with tens of thousands of flagella. The position of the flagella and the arrangement of the microtubules varies among species as well. The following sections will briefly outline general characteristics of the zoids found in each subset as well as provide specific examples. =Zoids in heterokonts= Heterokonts are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms that include diatoms, green algae, and brown algae. The defining characteristic of this group is their bi-flagellate, motile sperm (zoid). The two flagella are most commonly positioned apically or sub-apically depending on the type of heterokont. One flagella, the tinsel flagella, is generally longer and covered with bristles. The other flagella is typically shorter, potentially even shortened to just a basal body, and is generally smooth and whip-like. *In Green Algae Green algae have a life cycle that includes an alternation of generations. Zoids can be found in both the haploid and the diploid phases of this life cycle in certain green alga. Number of flagella is one characteristic that aids in the classification of different types of green alga. Zoids are either released through pores or by lysing of the zoid-producing cells in either the gametangium or the sporangium. A majority of the zoids produced within this group are either bi-flagellate or quadri-flagellate. To represent the diversity of zoids found in green alga, below is a list of genera from the family Monostromataceae which is part of the phylum Chlorophyta. :*Genus Monostroma - produces bi-flagellate gametes and quadri-flagellate zoospores :*Genus Gayralia - produces bi-flagellate zoids in the monomorphic asexual form :*Genus Protomonostroma - produces quadri-flagellate zoids :*Genus Ulvopsis - produces bi-flagellate gametes, bi- flagellate asexual zoids, and quadri-flagellate zoospores :*Genus Ulvaria - produces biflagellate gametes and quadri-flagellate zoospores *In Brown Algae Brown algae (Phaeophyceae) reproduce both sexually and asexually depending on the species. However, all motile reproductive cells in the Class are flagellated and there are no free-living flagellate organisms. The structure of brown algae varies depending on Family and Genus, thus zoids are produced in a variety of ways. Gametes or asexual zoospores can be produced in plurilocular zoidangia in the larger thalli of brown alga. However, in smaller thalli, unilocular zoidangia produce the sexually or asexually reproductive cells. Below is some vocabulary associated with brown algal zoid production: :* Plurilocular = many chambered, each chamber produces one zoid :* Unilocular = one chamber, can produce multiple gametes in one chamber :* Plurilocular gametangia = structure that has many chambers that produce haploid gametes :* Plurilocular sporangia = structure that has many chambers that produce diploid spores :* Plurilocular zoidangia = collective term for plurilocular gametangia and plurlocular sporangia :* Plurizoids = zoids produced in a plurlocular zoidangia :* Unilocular sporangia = can produce meiospores or asexual spores :* Unilocular zoidangia = synonym for unilocular sporangia :* Unizoids = zoids produced in a unilocular zoidangia Brown alga zoids have the same two basic flagella discussed in the heterokont section. However, orientation of the flagella is unique in the Phaeophyceae. In general, the flagella are both inserted laterally. *In Diatoms Zoids are not as common in the diatoms as in the algal families. Diatoms are generally broken into two categories, the centric diatoms and the pennate diatoms. Of these two categories, only the centric diatoms have been found to produce zoids and only the male gametes have flagella. These motile, male gametes have been found to only possess one flagellum with no signs of even a rudimentary second flagella. This deviates from the standard definition of a heterokont. Because of this deviation, diatoms are often classified as \\"stramenopiles\\". =Zoids in non-vascular plants and fungi= Among the non-vascular plants, specifically the Bryophytes, species that sexually reproduce will utilize zoids as their gametes. Many species of Bryophytes are primarily asexually reproducing structures that reproduce by fragmentation or cloning. When the Bryophytes do reproduce sexually, the male zoids must swim from the antheridia to the archegonia. These zoids are generally bi-flagellate but this can vary species to species. Fungi are a very diverse group of organisms with very diverse life cycles. Most reproduce using spores and many do not utilize zoids for their reproduction. However, one particular class of organisms that is very closely related to fungi use a similar zoid to the heterokonts mentioned above. Oomycota or water molds are a group of potentially pathogenic fungi-like eukaryotic organisms that utilize bi-flagellate zoids as their reproductive spores. The zoids are only released in aquatic environments. These oomycetes have been responsible for disease outbreaks such as sudden oak death and the potato famine (early blight). =Zoids in vascular plants= Zoids are found in three types of vascular plants; ferns, cycads, and Ginkgo biloba. The zoids of each of these groups are large and multi-flagellated. The mature spermatozoids of the fern Asplenium onopteris are 8 to 8.5 micrometers in length and contain 50 flagella. The zoid of the cycad can be up to 300 to 500 micrometers long and can contain thousands of flagella. The zoid of the ginkgo is approximately 86 micrometers long and also can contain thousands of flagella. Because of the high number of flagella associated with both cycads and ginkgo, there has been some debate as to whether they are flagella or cilia. Either way, cycads and Ginkgo are rare woody plants that produce motile gametes. Evolution In plants, the zoid, or swimming sperm, is considered to be a trait of the \\"lower\\" land plants. In aqueous environments, the necessity for motile reproduction is obvious, but on land this adaptation losses its relevance. The zoid is most common among the non-vascular plants and the \\"lower\\" vascular plants. It is hypothesized that as the land plants evolved enclosed ovules, the necessity for a film of water and therefore motile sperm became unnecessary. The occurrence of motile, flagellated sperm or zoids in angiosperms is incredibly rare. Along the same lines, the Ginkgo is a species that has no close living relative. It is believed to be most closely related to the giant seed ferns which date back to the Jurassic period. This represents what would also be considered a \\"lower\\" land plant. Ginkgo were originally classified in the Taxaceae, or yew, family. When it was discovered that ginkgo had motile sperm, they were moved to their own family, Ginkgoaceae.

Its yard is located in Samho-eup, Yeongam, South Korea. History The company was first established with a name of 'Incheon Shipbuliding(Ïù∏Ï≤úÏ°∞ÏÑ†)' in 1977 as a subsidiary company of Halla Group(ÌïúÎùºÍ∑∏Î£π). (The founder of 'Halla group' was Chung In-Young the younger brother of Chung Ju-Yung, the founder of Hyundai Group) The first ship building dock was constructed in Incheon(Ïù∏Ï≤ú), South Korea. In 1990, the company changed its name into 'Halla Heavy Industries'(ÌïúÎùºÏ§ëÍ≥µÏóÖ) and moved the dock yard from Incheon to Samhoup which is located in Yeongam, South Jeolla Province. (total 3,300,000 square metres of land) In 1997, during the Asian Financial Crisis, the mother company Halla group (was ranked 12th in terms of equity at that time) has fallen into bankruptcy, bringing its affiliates into the slump as well. In this chaos, Halla Heavy Industries had filed for bankruptcy protection. The Korean Government decided to consign the company's management to Hyundai Heavy Industries for 5 years. The condition was selling the company to Hyundai Heavy Industries when the company restore its financial state. In 1998, RH Heavy Industries (Rothschild Halla Heavy Industries), a temporary company which inherited only the assets and debt from Halla Heavy Industries, has been established. In 1999, RH Heavy Industries changed the name into 'Samho Heavy Industries' and in 2003, it finally changed the name into 'Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries' after the acquisition of Hyundai Heavy Industries in 2002. Today, Hyundai Heavy Industries owns 94.92% of the company's stock. The company's formal establish year was 1998, because the company was formally re- established as RH Heavy Industries in 1998 when Rothschild temporarily bought the company. Achievements After the purchase by Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries has experienced rapid growth both internally and externally. In 2004, only 2 years after the take over of Hyundai Heavy Industries, the company has recorded $1 billion of overseas sales. In 2006, the company built a hull of a FPSO (Floating Production Storage Offloading) vessel and started to build LNG Carriers, LPG carriers and PCTCs (Pure Car & Truck Carrier). Furthermore, the company increased the capability of ship building up to 50 ships per year by constructing a mega size floating dry dock. 3 years later in 2009, Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries recorded an outstanding $3 billion of overseas sales. At the same year, the company has built a 30 million CGT ship in the shortest time period among the entire shipbuilding industry. Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries now has 2 mega docks and an additional floating dock which can produce approximately 50 ships annually (4.3 Million GT), 5 Goliath Cranes including cranes of maximum lifting limit of 1200 tonnes and 900 tonnes. According to Clarkson Research, Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries is apparently the 5th largest shipbuilding company in the world. The company not only possess world class painting shops but also have obtained ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certificates. Products Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries has two major divisions - Ship Building and Industrial Equipment. The Ship Building division mainly produces Tankers, Bulk carriers, Container ships, Gas and Chemical carriers (mostly LNG carriers). The Industrial Equipment division manufactures industrial transportation equipment such as goliath cranes and container offloading cranes. The company is also participating in the Panama Canal Locks rebuilding project since 2010. =Ship Building= Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries has total of 3 docks. The 1st Dock(504 x 100 x 13m) can produce up to 800,000DWTs, 2nd Dock(594 x 104 x 13m) 1,000,000DWTs and No.1 Berth Dock(335 x 70 x 24m) which is the Floating Dock 500,000DWTs. The length of the Docks total up to 2.1 km while average depth is 12m. 5 Goliath Cranes are in operation. Two 600 tonne cranes are at the 1st Dock, two 900 tonne cranes at 2nd Dock, one 1200 tonne mega crane at the No.1 Berth Dock. Fully operating the 3 docks can build up to 50 ships annually. (1 ship in 8 days) To build one ship takes approximately 20 to 24 months, including Contract, Ship Designing, Keel Laying, Launching, Delivery, After Service and so on. Most of the materials are Hi-Ten Steel Plate and Mild Steel Plate. The 3 largest suppliers are Posco, Dongkuk Steel and Hyundai Steel.

Overview The album is an Opal release, with no catalogue number. The music on the album was made for an Installation ‚Äì a show featuring music and visuals ‚Äì that took place at the White Cube art gallery in London, from 25 April to 31 May 1997. The gallery describes itself as \\"possibly the smallest exhibition space in Europe\\", and consists of a simple square room, painted white. During the show, white blinds covered the two windows in one wall and a suspended ceiling muffled lights that were suspended above it. Mounted on each of the four walls was a CD-player with two speakers on either side, playing random tracks. Eno created the music by selecting random sites situated within a one-mile radius of the White Cube and recording a variety of ambient sounds around him, such as crowd-noise, the ringing bells of clock-towers, weather and rushing traffic. On top of this he also recorded himself singing a single, long note at each location. Taking the raw recordings back to his London studio, he ran them through a variety of enhancement software/hardware to produce a series of time-stretched, compressed, equalised, reverberating compositions, which he burned onto CDs (8 to 16 tracks on each). These were the discs that were fed into the Installation players and set to 'random'. Eno says \\"I was thinking of the sound less as music and more as sculpture, space, landscape, and of the experience as a process of immersion rather than just of listening.\\" The Extracts from Music for White Cube album was originally the \\"catalogue\\" to accompany the Installation, which has a short essay on the inlay card. During the Installation's run at the White Cube gallery, visitors could also select from, and buy, a series of unique CD-Rs named Contra 1.2. These varied in length from around 20 to 50 minutes, and the music was created with Koan's music-generation software.

Personal life Albert Collier was born on 9 July 1909 in Collingwood, the seventh of the ten children of Albert Augustus Collier, signwriter, and his wife Hannah Josephine, n√©e Binks, Albert grew up living opposite Victoria Park, the home ground of the Collingwood Football Club and was educated at the nearby Victoria Park State School. He later married Mavis Thelma Leibie (1917‚Äì2003) and they had two sons. Albert Collier died in 1988 at his home in Seaford and is buried at Frankston Cemetery. Playing career In 1924 both Albert and his brother Harry played for the Melbourne district club Ivanhoe and their strong performances led to the brothers being invited to try out for Collingwood. Albert Collier made his Collingwood debut in 1925 and soon established himself in the team. He initially played forward, but after a couple of seasons became a powerful centre half back, and he was a vital part of 'The Machine', the 1927-1930 Collingwood teams who won four premierships in a row. This feat has not been repeated to date. At the height of the Great Depression Collier left Collingwood to coach Cananore Football Club in Tasmania, winning both a premiership and the William Leitch Medal in 1931 and representing Tasmania in the State Carnival. In 1933 Collier returned to Collingwood, and from 1935 to 1939 served as vice-captain with his brother Harry as captain. In each of those years the ‚ÄòMagpies‚Äô contested the grand final, winning two further premierships (1935 and 1936). Before the 1940 season the Collingwood committee forced the Collier brothers into a reluctant retirement, and Albert transferred to Fitzroy where he played in 1941 and 1942. Collier later captain-coached Camberwell in the throw-pass era VFA from 1945 until 1946, earning acclaim for building and leading the team to the minor premiership and a losing Grand Final in 1946. He later coached country teams at Kyneton and at Sea Lake.

Saga is touted as the world's first collectible online real-time strategy game. Saga was released on March 4, 2008 after a brief open Beta which began February 26, 2008. Developed by American studios Wahoo Studios and Silverlode Interactive, the game ran a closed Beta starting July 5, 2007. The title has no subscription fees, instead being supported by the release of booster or expansion packs. It is possible to play a free version of the game, with certain features locked, at the Saga official site.http://www.playsaga.com Saga launched into hobby stores around the United States and Canada following GAMA 2008. SAGA has partnered with Alliance Game Distributors, GTS Distribution, Diamond Comics and ACD Distribution, with an emphasis to focus on game and card stores to sell the booster packs. Plot Saga is set in a fantasy world where an age-old strife exists between five competing Gods. Each God heads up a faction with unique races and abilities. The factions are Magic (Dark Elves), Machines (Dwarves), Nature (Elves), War (Orcs and Ogres), Undead (Undead) and Light (Giants and Humans). Each faction is diametrically opposed to two other factions. For example, Machines hates Magic (they are naturally opposite, technology vs. mysticism), and Machines also hates Nature (machines vs. living things). Nature also despises War, for their tendency to destroy nature. Light faction are champions of order and justice, while Magic faction delve deep into the black arts, and the circle completes itself. Each faction has an ethos and a strategic quality that sets it apart, giving players a spectrum of play styles to identify with. The system is designed to create a balanced tension between the factions, giving each faction two archenemies and two neutrals to war with or form alliances with. The result is a world where endless war is inevitable. However, the Machine (Dwarf) and Nature (Elf) factions have put aside their differences to join the Order (Machine, Nature, Light), and the remaining factions have joined the Brotherhood (War, Magic, Undead). The Undead faction is a recent (2008) addition and not part of the original five races. Gameplay Saga combines the trading card game (TCG) sensibilities of Magic: The Gathering, the MMO persistency of RPGs, and the kingdom management and mass battles of RTS titles such as Rome: Total War. Gameplay in Saga is best described in two states: kingdom management and battle. =Kingdom Management= In keeping with the RTS genre, gameplay in Saga revolves around managing a persistent, online kingdom. Each player is given a plot of land by their faction God, which they must develop and improve. These improvements include building defensive walls and towers, researching new technology at the university, and harvesting the available resources. Players, at the time of nation creation, choose which layout their nation will have. Then, as their resources grow (by questing or by peasant workforce) they can build buildings. Building spots are chosen by a system called \\"Free Build\\". Free build lets the user place buildings wherever they want, although there is a limit to how many of each building a player can build. Resources can be played on colored squares (brown = wood, gray = stone, gold = gold, purple = mana). There are an excess of these squares though, so one is not limited. Additionally, players maintain a population of peasants, which rises and falls depending on the popularity of the player as a leader. Unpopular leaders can suffer riots, leading to extensive damage to structures and mass desertions by peasants. A player will gain peasants by capturing houses in quests or in PvP. At 74 happiness one's peasants will riot and at 90 one gains production bonuses. Any happiness above this is excess and should be used to tax the peasants. Normally, if your happiness is above 74 you gain 4 peasants a day. However, after the happiness system was patched in 2008, peasant happiness is no longer displayed as a numerical value. Happiness is gained by winning battles (PvP or quests), bribery and by having sufficient food and housing. Generally, having happiness in 'jubilant' is considered ideal. =Battle= Troops Saga employs a booster pack system to amass troops. Each player receives an initial starter pack, as one would with a TCG, featuring a collection of various individual troops. These troops must be placed into like units to create an army. When more troops are needed, players buy \\"booster packs\\", which are a random selection of 10 troops ranging from common to rare. These troops can then be drafted into existing units, or traded off to other players. Through the trading system, players can customize their armies and trade for exactly what they are looking for. Trading takes place in the market, which also allows for resources to be traded, and troops to be bought and sold. There are also third party sites that sell individual cards. Units grow in experience, increasing their base efficacy. Additionally, units can be further upgraded through collecting special armor and weapons. Each unit can equip one armor and one weapon. This gear is obtained through Questing against computer-controlled opponents. Armor and weapons are subdivided into numerous types. For example, dragons use wards and charms, while mechanical (sometimes called 'machine', not to be confused with Machine faction) units mostly use siege gears and plates. Combat Combat in Saga is real-time, in keeping with the RTS genre, and consists of maneuvering units around the field to fight and gain an advantage over the enemy. Spells, special abilities and reinforcements add to the various strategies that can be employed to gain an advantage. Battles can be fought against computer- controlled opponents through the Quest system, or against other players in PvP battles. While quests largely take place on neutral battlefields across the world of Saga, PvP battles are city-to-city conflicts between the competing players. PvP battles can be fought between two or four players, either on teams or as a free-for-all. In PvP combat, the two (or four) players have their kingdoms stitched together so that battles take place upon their lands. Being a persistent world, damage inflicted during PvP battles in 'hardcore' mode carries over, including the pillaging and destruction of opponent's buildings, and the death of troops. Dead troops can be resurrected in temples using God-favor, a combat-based resource. PvP battles can be fought in \\"scrimmage\\" mode, which allows for players to compete without any permanent damage being done to their kingdoms or troops; no experience or resource rewards are accumulated through \\"scrimmage\\" games. Battles fought in 'normal' mode will result in death of troops but building damage will not carry over. However, rewards are less than in 'hardcore' mode. It is common practice among friendly matches to have an agreement not to excessively damage buildings during a 'hardcore' battle. Therefore, both parties receive battle rewards as in 'hardcore' mode while damage inflicted is kept to a minimum.

He replaced John Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley, on 1 May 2007. His tenure ended on 1 October 2010 when he was replaced by Bob Dudley following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. He has been chairman of Glencore Xstrata since May 2014. Education and early career Tony Hayward was born in Slough, Berkshire, in 1957; the eldest son of Bryan and Mary Hayward. Tony has five sisters and two brothers, the youngest sibling is adopted. Growing up Tony moved frequently but until a teenager lived in or near Slough. At the age of 15 when his sixth sibling was born Tony moved out of the family home and started living with his paternal grandparents in Langley (a suburb of Slough). Later on, his family moved to Bournemouth, Dorset. Tony however remained in Berkshire living with his grandparents and attended a local grammar school, Slough Technical High School until he started university. Tony went on to gain a first class geology degree from Aston University followed by a PhD from the University of Edinburgh School of Geosciences. Joining BP in 1982, with his first job as a rig geologist in Aberdeen, he quickly rose through the ranks in a series of technical and commercial roles in BP Exploration in London, Aberdeen, France, China and Glasgow. Hayward first came to Lord Browne's attention during a 1990 leadership conference in Phoenix, Arizona. As a result, he was made Browne's executive assistant.Tony Hayward bio at bp.com In 1992, Hayward moved to Colombia as exploration manager and became president of BP's operations in Venezuela in 1995. In August 1997, he returned to London as a director of BP Exploration. He became group vice-president of BP Amoco Exploration and Production as well as a member of the BP group's Upstream executive committee in 1999. Hayward was appointed BP group treasurer in September 2000 where his responsibilities included global treasury operations, foreign exchange dealing, corporate finance, project finance and mergers and acquisitions. Hayward became an executive vice-president in April 2002, and chief executive of exploration and production in January 2003. Replacement of Lord Browne Safety and production issues in Alaska and the explosion at the Texas City refinery, made Peter Sutherland, BP's non-executive chairman, accelerate the process for finding Lord Browne a replacement. His retirement timetable moved forward from end-2008, when Browne would be 60, when BP policy called for mandatory retirement, to July 2007. Hayward, having been described as CEO designate by both internal and media commentators, came to the fore amid the competition, including Robert Dudley, chief executive of TNK-BP, the company's Russian joint venture, and John Manzoni, head of refining and marketing. On 18 December 2006, in the run-up to replace Lord Browne as chief executive of BP Group, the Financial Times reported that Hayward had criticised BP's management at an internal management meeting, in the wake of a blast at the firm's Texas City refinery that killed 15 people and injured more than 170 others. Hayward made the comments at a town hall meeting in Houston: \\"We have a leadership style that is too directive and doesn't listen sufficiently well. The top of the organisation doesn't listen sufficiently to what the bottom is saying.\\" On 12 January 2007 BP announced that Hayward would replace Lord Browne as chief executive. On 2 February Andy Inglis was appointed managing director of the BP Group, and succeeded Hayward as chief executive of BP's Exploration & Production (E&P;) business. Hayward was appointed to the chief executive position with immediate effect on 1 May 2007, after Lord Browne resigned following the lifting of a legal injunction preventing Associated Newspapers from publishing details about his private life. BP was paying Hayward an annual salary of ¬£1,045,000; his 2008 bonus was ¬£1,496,000 and in 2009 his bonus was ¬£2,090,000. Negotiations with Russia's Igor Sechin In 2008, Tony Hayward had private meetings with Igor Sechin, a close ally of Putin and a top figure of Russian military and security services, currently serving as a CEO of largest Russian oil company Rosneft. The two negotiated on BP's deals with Russia.Tony Hayward lets Kremlin know that its reputation is at risk over bitter TNK-BP struggle Deepwater Horizon oil spill Barack Obama with Tony Hayward and the BP board of directors talking about clean-up of the oil. On 20 April 2010, an explosion occurred on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, operated by BP. Eleven people were killed in the blast and oil began to leak from the ocean floor at a rate variously estimated to be between and per day. Hayward, and BP in general, initially downplayed the spill, stating on 17 May 2010 that the environmental impact of the Gulf spill would likely be \\"very very modest\\" and calling the spill \\"relatively tiny\\" in comparison with the size of the ocean. By 27 May, Hayward changed his assessment, calling the spill an \\"environmental catastrophe\\" in an interview with CNN. On 12 May 2009, in a postgraduate lecture to Stanford Business School, Hayward analysed the role and organisation of the company for which he acted as chief executive officer. During the lecture he stated to the business students that \\"...our primary purpose in life is to create value for our shareholders. In order to do that you have to take care of the world\\". Hayward stated that his job might be at risk as a result of the spill, saying \\"we made a few little mistakes early on.\\" He received criticism for various statements he had made during the spill, including telling a camera man to \\"get out of there\\" during a photo-op on the shores of Louisiana. On 30 May, he told a reporter \\"we're sorry for the massive disruption it's caused to their lives. There's no one who wants this thing over more than I do, I'd like my life back.\\" He was widely condemned for his comment which was perceived as selfish, and United States Representative Charlie Melancon (D-La.) called on Hayward to resign in the wake of this comment. He later apologised for the comment on BP America's Facebook Page. On 31 May, Hayward disputed claims of huge underwater plumes of oil suspended in the Gulf, as had been reported by scientists from three universities. Hayward said there was \\"no evidence\\" that plumes of oil were suspended under the sea, and that because it is lighter than water any plumes seen are just in the process of rising to the surface. A chemist from Louisiana State University agreed with this assessment. Still other scientists have suggested that the manner of expulsion of the oil from the well and the use of dispersants may have led to an emulsion situation in which the oil is suspended in water for some time. On 5 June the Daily Telegraph reported that Hayward sold approximately one third of his shares in BP a month before the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded. The shares subsequently fell in value by 30%, although the Telegraph stated: \\"There is no suggestion that he acted improperly or had prior knowledge that the company was to face the biggest setback in its history.\\" In an interview on NBC on 8 June, US President Barack Obama said that Hayward \\"wouldn't be working for me after any of those statements\\", referring to the remarks Hayward made following the spill. The Obama administration had been public in their criticism of BP for the oil spill.() Before a congressional hearing on the oil spill held on 17 June, subcommittee chairman Bart Stupak of Michigan said that he expected Hayward to be \\"spliced and diced\\" by both himself and other committee members. Hayward's eleven-page document that he read to the committee included a passage in which he said he would \\"pledge as leader of BP that we will not stop until we stop this well ... and address economic claims in a responsible manner\\". He continued, \\"This is a complex accident, caused by an unprecedented combination of failures. A number of companies are involved, including BP, and it is simply too early to understand the cause.\\" On 18 June, the day after Hayward appeared before the congressional hearing, the chairman of BP said that Hayward would step away from daily involvement in the company's efforts in the Gulf. On 19 June, the day before Father's Day, Hayward was in Cowes ‚Äì having taken a \\"day off\\" ‚Äì to see Bob, his co-owned boat, participate in the JP Morgan Asset Management Round the Island yacht race off the Isle of Wight. Rahm Emanuel, President Obama's chief of staff, said that Hayward had committed yet another in a \\"long line of PR gaffes\\" by attending the race while the Gulf oil spill continued. In June, BP put Mississippi native Bob Dudley in charge of handling the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Dudley was appointed president and chief executive of the newly created Gulf Coast Restoration Organization, reporting to Hayward. Departure from BP Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, there were rumours that Hayward would resign, but the company dismissed these. A BBC report said that a BP press release stated that Hayward \\"has the full confidence of the board of directors of BP.\\" BP announced on 27 July 2010 that Hayward would be replaced by Bob Dudley as the company's chief executive effective as of 1 October 2010. CompactGTL In March 2013, Hayward was appointed chairman at UK-based gas-to-liquids company CompactGTL. Ongoing protests and controversy Hayward's involvement in Deepwater Horizon left him a highly controversial public figure. In May 2013 he was honoured as a \\"distinguished leader\\" by the University of Birmingham, but his award ceremony was interrupted several times by jeers and walk-outs. In July 2013 his award of an honorary degree from Robert Gordon University was described as \\"a very serious error of judgement\\" by Friends of the Earth Scotland.

This was one of the films where Amjad Khan plays a positive role. Nearly all of his other films with Amitabh Bachchan have been had him playing a villain role. One of the highlights of the film was its music by Rajesh Roshan and lyrics by Anjaan. Three songs, \\"Chhookar Mere Mann Ko,\\" \\"Tere Jaisa Yaar Kahan,\\" and \\"Saara Zamana Haseeno Ka Deewana\\" were super-hits and are still loved. \\"Saara Zamana Haseeno Ka Deewana\\" is particularly noteworthy because of Amitabh Bachchan's dance with clothes fitted with electric bulbs, which he himself operated from under his clothing, maintaining complete synchronization while dancing. Plot Kishan and Bishan are childhood friends. Kishan is an orphan, but is self-sufficient and hard- working, while Bishan comes from an affluent background. The friendship between the two is extremely strong and is the bane of Bishan's uncle, who has his eyes on his widowed sister's wealth. In a bid to separate the two friends, the uncle manipulates his sister into sending Bishan away to the city and then abroad for further education. When the two friends reunite years later, Bishan (Amjad Khan) discovers that Kishan (Amitabh Bachchan) has a great voice. Bishan is now a successful businessman and he wants to promote Kishan's singing talent. Kishan goes to the city with his friend, where Bishan asks Komal (Neetu Singh) to groom him to be a performer and a gentleman. Kishan tries to get expelled from the process by being uncooperative and disruptive. In the meantime, Bishan discovers that the family wealth has been systematically looted over the last 18 years by the uncle and his son. He is forced to borrow by mortgaging his remaining assets in order to ensure that Kishan becomes a successful singer. This causes a major rift between Bishan and his wife, who is convinced that Kishan will turn his back on his friend if he were to ever succeed. Kishan's debut concert is a huge success and he goes on to donate the proceeds of his earnings and consequent record deals in order to rid his friend Bishan of his many mortgages and in order to help woo his estranged sister-in-law and lovable nephew (Bishan's 10-year-old son) back into the house. Kishan proceeds to become a star and Komal (Neetu Singh) - his trainer professes her love for him. Bishan in the meanwhile falls into a conspiracy further set by his treacherous uncle (Jeevan) and cousin (Ranjeet). He is kidnapped alongside several hostages - primarily children on his shipping vessel, brainwashed, tortured and forced to sign a confession that all the misdeeds have been done by him. Bishan loses his mental stability and goes into shock. He is then thrown into an asylum after he has a breakdown and experiences amnesia. Kishan pretends to be mentally ill and admits himself into the asylum by tricking the authorities and saves his friend by reviving his memory successfully by feeding him rotis as he used to when they were children. The climax follows the typical action confrontation formula reminiscent of films in that era where there are big explosions and the heroes single-handedly take on hordes of goons. The movie ends with the children - hostages being saved, the family uniting and the treacherous mastermind (Ranjeet) being sent to jail. Cast * Amitabh Bachchan.... Kishan * Amjad Khan....

In 1958 he received the National University Theater Prize for his play \\"Nunca amanecer√°\\" and published a version of Oedipus (also titled \\"La Esfinge sin Secreto\\"). In 1960, his work \\"Cerca de las estrellas\\" received the National Calder√≥n de la Barca Theater prize and in 1961 the Aguilar prize. The play was presented at the National Teatro Mar√≠a Guerrero that same year and taken to the cinema in 1962. In 1964 he wrote \\"Noches de San Juan\\", which received the fithe Lope de Vega award and was presented at the Mar√≠a Guerrero National Theater in 1965. Many of the works written in this period, including the most successful ones, \\"Cerca de las estrellas\\" and \\"Noches de San Juan\\", are part of the Spanish realist mouvement . At the same time he writes a series of plays that belong to the Theater of Cruelty current (\\"la cita\\", \\"el asedio\\", \\"los laberintos, \\"el funcionario\\", \\"la espera\\"). A third group of works, which include the aforementioned Oedipus, and, between 1963 and 1964 \\"Yo, Mart√≠n Lutero\\" and the trilogy \\"Mario\\", \\"Sila\\" and \\"C√©sar\\" address major issues such as faith, freedom and power with language of tragedy. \\"Yo, Mart√≠n Lutero\\" was forbidden by Franco¬¥s regime cesnsorship when it was already being rehearsed. He subsequently wrote several plays for children: the original musical \\"El Cocherito Ler√©\\", and adaptations of The Blue Bird and Don Quixote, also premiered at the Mar√≠a Guerrero Theater respectively in 1966, 1967 and 1973. Between 1965 and 1971 he carried out numerous adaptations for television. In 1971 he received the Golden Quixote award for the scripts of the television series \\"P√°ginas Sueltas\\" and in 1978 wrote \\"El juglar y la reina\\". In 1969 he premiered in Madrid an adaptation of Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s¬¥ novel Fortunata y Jacinta. The play would be re-released at the Santander International Festival in 1993 and at the Teatro Espa√±ol in Madrid in 1994. He would also write, in 1977, the scripts for a television series based on the novel. In addition he wrote scripts for several films: \\"Cerca de las Estrellas\\" (1962), \\"Marta\\" (1970), \\"Tormento\\" (1973) and co-wrote the script of the film Fortunata y Jacinta (1969). He drew inspiration from the work of Arthur Miller for his screenplays. He refrained from making public most of his poetry during this period. Only at the end of his life did he publish his book \\"El crisantemo y la cometa\\", written in 1971, and his \\"Biograf√≠a secreta\\" is posthumous. He is left a number of unpublished novels and essays. Between 1972 and 1977 he premiered a good number of adaptations of novels and classic plays, including El Busc√≥n, and wrote several original works: \\"Las herderas del sol\\", \\"Los extra√±os amantes\\", and \\"Un periodista espa√±ol\\" (based on the life of Mariano Jos√© de Larra).

It is normally celebrated by the ethnic Kadazan-Dusuns, as well as by other related ethnic groups in the state, and lasts for the whole of the month of May, ending with a public holiday on a date selected by a priestess known as the bobohizan. A beauty pageant known as Unduk Ngadau will be held and it ends the harvest festival with a newly crowned Unduk Ngadau in the annual host district, Penampang. The Harvest Festival comes under the ambit of what is known as Momolianism, the belief system and life philosophy of the Kadazan-Dusun. There is also a dance performance called the Sumazau, a singing contest called Sugandoi, a bodybuilding competition, and other arts and crafts performances. Competitions such as hitting the gong and folk sports have also become one of the main events in this festival. Popular drinks during the festival are tapai and Kinomol, which is a traditional alak drink.

Description The magician presents an upright cabinet that is just big enough to hold a person with a little space above their head. The magician then presents a rack of metal spikes. Spectators are offered the chance to tap the spikes with a metal implement to prove they are real and solid. The spikes are fitted into the top of the cabinet pointing downwards. An assistant is introduced and steps into the cabinet. The door is closed and the spikes are forced downwards using handles that protrude through slots in the side of the cabinet. The implication is that the assistant must have been impaled by the spikes. However the door is opened to reveal the assistant alive and unharmed. There are several slight variations. Sometimes the assistant carries a string of inflated balloons when he or she steps into the cabinet. These are burst as the spikes descend to give an added audible dimension to the illusion. Another description has a small door opened to show the assistant alive when the spikes are at the bottom of the cabinet; the small door is then closed again and the spikes lifted to the top before the assistant is finally fully revealed. French magician Don Jos√© de Murcia performs a version of this illusion under the title \\"La Herse Infernal\\". History The illusion is thought to be the creation of Floyd Thayer, founder of the Thayer Magic Company. Blueprints for it appeared in the Thayer catalog #7 supplement, which dates it to the early 1930s. References Further reading * The Great illusions of Magic, pub.

Frith directed the performance but did perform himself. Impur is the first of two performances commissioned by L‚ÄôEcole Nationale de Musique while Frith was resident music professor at the institution. The second was Impur II (2009). Background Between 1994 and 1996, Frith was Composer-in-Residence at L‚ÄôEcole Nationale de Musique in Villeurbanne, France. At the end of the two-year residency, Frith organised a musical event at the school involving as many students as possible. He grouped them according to their music disciplines and placed them in all the rooms of a music building. Each group of musicians then played music Frith had prepared for them or, when required, improvised. Using synchronized stopwatches, all the groups, who could not hear each other, played strictly according to a 55-minute time-score that Frith had written. During the concert the public was invited to wander from room to room, or sit in the courtyard and listen to the sounds from the open windows.

By complementing official forest law enforcement activities with the objectivity and public credibility of an independent third party, IFM can improve transparency in the short term while contributing to the development of a sound legislative and regulatory framework for responsible forest management. Transparency was emphasized as a key element in Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at the Conference of the Parties (COP-15) in Copenhagen in December 2009 in its decisions on methodological guidance for forest monitoring systems. Principles IFM has been defined by Global Witness as ‚Äúthe use of an independent third party that, by agreement with state authorities, provides an assessment of legal compliance, and observation of and guidance on official forest law enforcement systems.‚Äù IFM centres around the establishment of a partnership between an official ‚Äòhost institution‚Äô responsible for oversight of the forest sector and an appointed monitoring organisation. The monitor‚Äôs principal activity is to conduct field investigations to observe the work of the official law enforcement agency and to document illegal activity in the forest and related trade. These investigations result in the publication of authoritative information on forest operations, which is made widely available to all levels of government, industry, and civil society. By monitoring official forest law enforcement, IFM enables mechanisms of illegal activity and corruption to be identified. Monitors expect their evidence to be acted on and will pro-actively guard against entrenched resistance to improved governance. Use IFM has been undertaken in Cambodia, Cameroon, Republic of Congo, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and piloted in many other countries. IFM has also been called Independent Monitoring, Independent Observation, and Third Party Observation.

The dam is located in Aroostook Junction, New Brunswick, immediately downstream of Fort Fairfield, Maine, and less than 1 km east of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. The reservoir floods the Aroostook River valley into a portion of northeastern Maine. The dam was built in 1923 and the power house contains 5 hydroelectric units (1-5) which were placed in service between 1923‚Äì1965. The Tinker Generating Station benefits from flow regulation upstream in Maine on Millinocket Lake and on the Aroostook River in Squa Pan. There are also control facilities and a power house canal located on the Maine side of the border. The Tinker Generating Station was constructed as a joint project of the New Brunswick Electric Power Commission and the Maine Public Service. In 1999, the Maine Public Service sold its share of the plant to WPS Power Development, LLC of De Pere, Wisconsin.

The character is portrayed by Liz White. In the American version the character's surname is changed to 'Norris' and she is portrayed by Gretchen Mol.https://www.bbc.co.uk/lifeonmars/characters/annie.shtml Character history During the first series of Life on Mars, the character was a Woman Police Constable serving in uniform. Early in the second series, DCI Gene Hunt allows her to join CID as Woman Detective Constable. Throughout both series, Cartwright helps the programme's protagonist, Sam Tyler adjust to life in the 1970s. A degree of attraction is displayed between the two characters, lending a distinct sexual tension. Cartwright is the only person in 1973 who Sam tells that he has travelled back in time, and she treats him sympathetically, believing that he is suffering from severe concussion after being hit by a car. During the first episode of series one, when Sam climbs onto the police station roof, considering suicide, Cartwright convinces him not to jump. Upon Sam first losing consciousness after the car accident which sent him back in time, he sees a fleeting image of a woman in a red dress running away from an attacker. The image is later revealed to be a childhood memory of Annie chasing after Sam's father, and being attacked by him. No references are made to Annie's family in either the first or second series, apart from a mention of an unnamed nephew in \\"The Crash\\", which indicates that she has a brother or sister. Before the final episodes of Ashes to Ashes, the reason for her absence and whereabouts have never been stated. During the course of Ashes to Ashes it is revealed that Sam and Annie married and were described as the \\"happiest couple ever seen\\" and had no children. In the finale, Keats mentions that there is no trace of Annie anywhere but it is revealed in the final episode that Gene Hunt, who helps souls of the police force pass on, ultimately helped both Sam and Annie move on, implying that Annie too was a police officer either killed or critically injured in the real world. Some fans believe she was most likely beaten to death by Vic Tyler as witnessed by a young Sam Tyler, however this notion creates continuity issues as she is \\"alive\\" in the series after the attack by Vic Tyler. This attack also takes place after her actual death prior to being assisted to move on by Gene Hunt. American character Gretchen Mol as Annie in the American remake. In the US remake, Annie Norris (Gretchen Mol) is a uniformed policewoman with an undergraduate psychology education who has aspirations of making the detective squad.

The game was released in Japan in May 1997, and later in Europe in August 1998. Pet in TV consists of teaching a virtual pet known as a PiT (Pet in TV) tricks, getting it new costumes and learning it what items are edible in the wild along with solving random puzzles around the PiT world. Pet in TV on release gained very bad reviews for its lack of gameplay, storyline and lasting appeal. It was re-released on the Japanese PlayStation Network for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable on February 22, 2007. The game and its Japan-exclusive sequel, Pet in TV with my dear Dog, were developed by the same team responsible for the Jumping Flash! series. Gameplay The player can choose from a selection of PiTs and name it. It is then up to the player to nurture their PiT and allow it to explore the 3D world, learning from its encounters with scenery and objects through trial-and-error. Once these behaviours are learned, the PiT will know how to respond to those objects in the future (such as a Flower, or a Spike). Whenever the PiT becomes injured, or tired, returning it to its home will allow Dr. Y to fix it. The objective then becomes for the player's PiT to solve puzzles on its own - for which it will be rewarded with AI upgrade chips. Reception PlayStation Power gave the game a rating of 59%, and said it was \\"dull for adults\\" and \\"a bit bland\\".

She published her first novel, Quant au riche avenir, when she was 17. She won the Prix Goncourt in 2009. Her play Papa doit manger is the sole play by a living female writer to be part of the repertoire of the Com√©die fran√ßaise. Biography NDiaye was born in 1967 in Pithiviers, France, less than a hundred kilometers south of Paris, to a French mother and a Senegalese father. She grew up with her mother in the suburbs of Paris. Her parents met as students in the mid-1960s, but her father left for Africa when she was only one year old. She began writing at the age of 12. As a senior in high school, she was discovered by Jerome Lindon, founder of √âditions de Minuit, who published her first novel, Quant au riche avenir, in 1985.Rapha√´lle R√©rolle, \\"Libre d‚Äô√©crire\\", Le Monde, 3 November 2009. She subsequently wrote a further six novels, all published by Minuit, and a collection of short stories. She also wrote her Com√©die classique, a 200-page novel made up of a single sentence, which was published by √âditions P.O.L in 1988, when she was 21 years old. As well as novels, NDiaye has written a number of plays and a screenplay. Her 2003 drama Papa doit manger is only the second play by a female writer to be taken into the repertoire of the Com√©die fran√ßaise. In 1998, NDiaye wrote a letter to the press in which she argued that her novel La Sorci√®re, published two years earlier, had strongly informed the content of Naissance des fant√¥mes, the second novel of successful author Marie Darrieussecq.Antoine de Gaudemar, \\"Marie NDiaye pol√©mique avec Marie Darrieussecq\\", Lib√©ration, 3 March 1998.

Exile in Berlin In an interview published by Les Inrockuptibles on 30 August 2009, NDiaye declared about Sarkozy's France, \\"I find that France monstrous. The fact that we [with her companion (the writer ) and their three children-- editor's note] have chosen to live in Berlin for two years is far from being unrelated to that. We left just after the elections, in a large part because of Sarkozy, even if I am very aware that saying that can seem snobbish. I find that atmosphere of vulgarity and heavy policing detestable ...

It is the last and final sequel to the Young and Dangerous film series. Synopsis Chicken (Jordan Chan) is set to marry the daughter of a Japanese yakuza boss (Sonny Chiba). When Chicken is set up, his old pals return to clear his name. Plot The story starts with Chan Ho-Nam (Ekin Cheng) still being paranoid about the horrific death and his relationship with Smartie (Gigi Lai) which constantly gives him nightmares. After having Mei Ling (Shu Qi) hinting that she wants to marry Ho-Nam, Ho-Nam shown little to no reaction due to the fear of losing another loved ones. That night, Ho-Nam goes to his pub only to be noticed that Chicken (Jordan Chan) was set up by Taiwan's San Leun Triad to be married into a Yakuza family as a political marriage. At that wedding day at Japan, Ho-Nam met with Akira Kusakari (Roy Cheung), the Yakuza leader's adopted son. At the wedding venue, Hung Hing's attending members were met by Chicken's cousin and one of the district leader the Taiwanese gang San Leun, Koh Chi-Wah (Blackie Ko) who then introduced to the son of San Leun's dragonhead, Lui Fu-Kawn (Peter Ho) and after the meeting, the wedding start and ended in hilarity. After the wedding, Hung Hing's attending members like Ben-Hon (Vincent Wan) and Sister 13 (Sandra Ng) followed Chi-Wah to a restaurant to celebrate. Out of happiness for his cousin and the recent victory of Chen Shui-bian as the new Taiwanese president, he over enthusiastically sang a Hokkien song which irate a bunch of Chinese nationals behind the group which soon turned into a brawl with the Chinese splashing tea on Chi-Wah. Chicken and Akira stopped the brawl in time and the next day, Chiang Tin-Yeung (Alex Man) finally met Ichio Kusakari (Sonny Chiba) and Ichio discussed about a tripartite alliance between them, Hung Hing and San Leun but Chiang announces his retirement to return to Thailand and declares that his position and all affairs of Hung Hing will be passed on to Ho-Nam. Hearing of Chiang's plans for retirement, Ichio too thought of retiring and leaving the business to the younger generation where he picked Chicken as his successor. After the meeting, Ichio praised Hung Hing's members for their strength and agility and curiously asked if they knew anything about Kendo. Chiang jokingly told Ichio that he may pass some knowledge to them where soon, a Kendo match was held and Ho-Nam took the plate and fought Ichio. Ichio managed to initially beat Ho-Nam by disarming him. Not be seen as a loser or a weakling, Ho-Nam used his countless battle skills on the streets of Hong Kong into good use by tying his weapon to his hand and fought mostly single-handedly as he is accustomed to and forced Ichio into a draw. Back in Taiwan, San Leun was also having a meeting to talk about the new leadership of the gang. Fu-Kwan denied the request to be the new dragonhead as his long period of stay in the US has made him unfamiliar with Taiwan despite being Taiwanese so Chi-Wah recommended Chicken due to his contribution to the gang but Chicken himself also denied the request as he had no ambitions to be the dragonhead and stated that \\"Picking a dragonhead shouldn't be about his nationality or whether he's a Taiwanese or can he speak Min-Nan language but more of courage and tenacity\\". Due to the constant rejection from another gang leader to appoint Chicken as the new suggested dragonhead, Chi-Wah again nearly came up to brawl with the other person. A few days later had passed and Fu-Kwan was met with an accident. As the dispute about the new San Leun's leadership contention wasn't settled, Chicken was instantly blamed for causing the crash but as he arrived at the hospital after receiving the news, he declared he's not the one to do it and Fu-Kwan believes him. Despite the infighting, Chicken was brought to a meeting with an old Taiwanese mafia boss who told the present that the situation is changing and the new government wants nothing but for the gangsters to cooperate with them. Chicken went to ask a veteran gang leader on his views. After that, both Chicken and Chi-Wah went to a karaoke lounge to have fun and a bunch of girls flirted with them. Suddenly, a girl that was on top of Chicken took out a dagger and tried to stab at Chicken, who saw the dagger, fought her off and both guys flee the lounge. Both fled towards a road but found both sides to be surrounded by gangsters of unknown origin and the two guys instantly fought their way out. However, Chi-Wah blocked the gangsters off for Chicken to run away only for him to be hit in the head and laying on the ground with Chicken fighting to get him out but failed and saw Chi-Wah being beaten to death while being extricated. At the same time, Nanako (Anya Wu), Chicken's wife, was alone at home and Akira came to visit drunk. While Nanako was taking care of him, he professed that he had always loved Nanako but it was his father's mistake to not let them be together and forcefully raped Nanako. While taking care of his still-shaken wife, Chicken's buddies, Ho-Nam and friends, came to Taiwan to find out what was happening. Knowing how the current politics is useless and in disarray and his support, Chi-Wah, dead, Ho-Nam declares his full support for Chicken together with Dai- Tau/Big Head (Chin Kar-Lok) and Pou-Pan (Jerry Lamb). However, Chicken told Ho-Nam not to worry as he'll settle his own issue and their arrival to support him had already made him happy. Ho-Nam then went to meet Mei Ling who was shopping. She's late due to buying a watch for Ho-Nam but with Ho-Nam passing the watch back to her, in a fit of anger, she storms off and at the corner of his eye, he saw a girl that looked very much like Smartie. Curious, he followed her to her workplace at an kindergarten and both had a chat and learnt that her name is Rong Yu and she's also from Hong Kong and both became friends. At the safehouse where Chicken was hiding, his underling noticed a bunch of cars approaching the house and in a panic, shouted that their under attack. Whilst preparing for an ambush, it turned out that the \\"unknown personal\\" was Ichio sitting on a wheelchair who came to look for Nanako and Chicken. After comforting Nanako, Ichio explained to Chicken that Akira was a traitor who sold the Yakuza's evil deeds to the police and Akira was the cause of his disability. Vowing for vengeance for both Ichio and Nanako, Chicken promises to kill Akira. At the meantime, Fu-Kwan was released from hospital and it was revealed that the assassination attempt on Chicken and Chi-Wah was all along orchestrated by Fu-Kwan to rid Chicken from San Leun. Ho-Nam then met with Fu-Kwan who questioned San Leun's internal conflict and their intentions on dealing with Chicken. Fu-Kwan, again lied and said that he had never doubted Chicken to be the one that caused him to be hospitalized but directly after Ho-Nam left the meeting, it was shown that both Akira and Fu- Kwan had always been working with each other in getting rid of Chicken. Ho-Nam then went to meet with Rong Yu and Mei Ling, who had always sensed that Ho-Nam was odd, followed him in the shadows and noticed both Rong Yu and Ho-Nam together. Mei Ling then followed Rong Yu back to the kindergarten where she voiced her displeasure about her relationship to Rong Yu. At the funeral of another contender of the leadership of San Luen (The one that had bad blood and gave advice to Chicken earlier in the show), things escalate out of control when Chicken entered the funeral hall and the whole of San Luen mobbing him. To control the situation, Ho-Nam took out a pistol and fired warning shots in the air. At the same time, Ichio entered the hall and declared that till Chicken is deemed the traitor, his life will be in Ichio's hands and if Chicken is found guilty, he will end Chicken's life himself. After the funeral, Chicken and Hung Hing's other members discuss plans on crippling Fu-Kwan's rising power. Knowing that he's already aligned himself with the new government and had planned to rename San Leun something else, they estimated that attacking Fu-Kwan head-on will be suicidal due to his ties with the government. During Chen Shui-bian's inauguration day, Fu-Kwan gave a speech on his ambitions of incorporating all gangs in Taiwan into an umbrella cooperation and plans to combine both Chi-Wah's \\"Black Panther Gang\\" and Chicken's \\"Venom Snake Gang\\" into a new entity with Akira at the helm. Chicken and the whole of Hung Hing bursts into the arena and Chicken declared Fu-Kwan the betrayer of San Leun with a traitor spilling out that the assassinations that had happened were all plotted by Fu-Kwan. With his family in Hung Hing's hands (The ploy Hung Hing came out with to threaten Fu-Kwan's power), the strategist of the gang had no choice but to spill the beans that what Chicken and the traitor who accused Fu-Kwan was right as everything that's happening to San Leun was done by Fu-Kwan. Soon after, the official who negotiated with Fu-Kwan also declared that the deal between San Leun and the government is off due to the ridiculous request of Fu-Kwan. Sensing defeat, Fu-Kwan slowly backs away from the crowd only to pull a pistol and firing a few rounds before fleeing with Akira. Ho-Nam and the rest gave chase. Akira nearly escaped but only to land himself in a hall where Ichio was waiting with Chicken for him. Surrounded by both ends, Akira instantly acts pitiful and asks for forgiveness. However, Ichio was having none of it and threw Akira a Wakizashi to commit hara-riki but instead of using it on himself, he flipped the dagger towards Ichio only to be disarmed by Ichio himself and dropped the dagger. Chicken then promptly took the dagger and stabbed Akira to death. At the same time, Ho-Nam was still chasing Fu-Kwan and both of them were driving themselves into a head-on collision. Both were not injured and soon climbed on top of their cars and continued fighting. Ho-Nam beats him easily but Fu-Kwan again draws his pistol on Ho-Nam. Ho-Nam, having no fear, inches closer to Fu- Kwan's barrel and few seconds later, the police arrives to arrest Fu-Kwan. The story ends with Ichio thanking the Taiwanese official for his assistance and revealed that Ichio himself can actually speak Mandrin all along.

It is one of the highest standard gauge railways in Europe and the second highest in Austria, after the Brenner. The 135.7 km line is a highly problematic mountain railway, in part because it is threatened by avalanches, mudslides, rockfalls and floods. It is operated by the Austrian Federal Railways (√ñBB) and frequented by international trains, including the Orient Express.  History and construction  Arlbergbahn tunnel construction As early as 1842 a railway over the Arlberg Pass was under discussion, as the British sought a rail connection for traffic from England to Egypt. Two years later, in 1847, Carl Ganahl - a textile industrialist from Feldkirch - decided to privately support construction of the railway, despite the many technical challenges involved. On the other hand, the opening of the Semmering Railway in 1854 showed that mountain railways were basically possible and feasible. Trade Minister Anton Freiherr von Banhans presented on March 22, 1872, at the Chamber of Deputies a draft law on the execution of the Arlberg railway at government expense for a total amount of 42 million florins. In 1879 the protagonists of the Arlbergbahn with the intended 10,270 m long summit tunnel were successful. The submitted project had won confidence by the progress in the Gotthard Tunnel. Julius Lott was appointed planning director of the Arlbergbahn. The construction of the Arlberg Railway started on June 20, 1880, and proceeded at a faster pace than planned. Completion was originally not expected until the autumn of 1885, but already by May 29, 1883, the valley route from Innsbruck to Landeck in Tyrol was put into service. On September 21, 1884, the entire stretch of the mountain railway was completed, including the then single- track, long Arlbergtunnel. The construction claimed 92 lives. The costs were totaled 38,165,282 crowns. The Arlberg tunnel rises from St. Anton on a length of approximately 4 km with 2 ‚Ä∞. The highest point is at 1310.926 m in kilometer 104.241 m. Then it falls to Langen am Arlberg at 15 ‚Ä∞.  Operation  The transalpine Arlberg Railway opened up a completely new connection between Lake Constance and the Adriatic Sea. Traffic increased so rapidly that already by July 15, 1885, a second track through the tunnel was opened, as had been planned since the beginning of the project. The most renowned train on the Arlberg route was the Orient Express, from London to Bucharest, which had only first-class compartments and parlors. Right from the beginning, the use of steam locomotives on the Arlberg led to serious problems: Passengers and crews were exposed to the unhealthy effects of sulfurous acid, which condensed from the steam in the tunnel. Grade slopes of up to 3.1% on the western ramp and 2.6% on the eastern ramp caused traction troubles for the locomotives. Finally, in 1924, this problem was eliminated with the completion of electrification of the tunnel, followed by the ramp sections in 1925. This electrification of the railway was carried out with a 15 kV, 16.7 Hertz system, allowing heavy trains to be pulled over the route once the tracks and supporting structures, including the Trisanna bridge in 1964, had been upgraded for the increased axle weights. Today, traffic through the Arlberg railway tunnel has increased considerably, despite competition from road transport through the Arlberg Road Tunnel. This has made it necessary to widen the approach ramps for double tracks. Many long-distance, high-speed EuroCity and Railjet trains ply the route from Vienna to Vorarlberg over the Arlberg. On the occasion of the World Ski Championships in 2001, the railway station of St. Anton on the eastern side of the Arlberg Tunnel was relocated from the town centre to a new site on the north side of the valley. This required the Arlberg tunnel be lengthened and the construction of the new Wolfsgruben tunnel. Beginning with 2020, the stretch of track between Landeck-Zams and √ñtztal will be selectively double-tracked, to increase capacity and improve the frequency of local services. The program, which was announced in 2018, will likely be completed by 2025, and was chosen over the more expensive full double-tracking plans. The first works are scheduled to take place between 19 and 21 September 2020, during which services will be disrupted.

It is one of the few non-horror films that both Linda Blair and Linnea Quigley star in. Plot After nearly being run down in the street by a gang known as the Scars, Brenda (Linda Blair) and her deaf-mute younger sister Heather (Linnea Quigley) and their friends trash the car of the gang leader, Jake. Jake exacts his revenge by getting his cohorts to gang-rape Heather. A fight between Brenda and her friends and the Scars at a local nightclub results in Brenda's pregnant, soon-to-be-married friend Francine being murdered by the Scars, who throw her off a viaduct. When Brenda learns who is responsible for Heather's rape, and that Francine is dead and the Scars are responsible, Brenda arms herself and sets out to avenge them. Finding them at a nearby warehouse, Brenda impales one of the gang members, Fargo, with an arrow; kills another, Red, by snapping a bear trap shut upon his neck; and then begins to torture Jake with arrows shot into his thighs and a hunting knife as he hangs by his feet from a gate. However, he then manages to free himself and attacks her. The showdown ends in a nearby paint store; as a burglar alarm blares, Brenda douses Jake in paint and then sets him on fire with a cigarette lighter that she has previously had difficulty getting to produce a flame, just before the police arrive. The movie ends with Brenda (who is presumably facing charges for the murders of Fargo, Red and Jake), Heather and their surviving friends visiting Francine's grave, and Brenda comments, \\"At least we set things right,\\" to which her friend Stevie replies, \\"No, Brenda.

The story centres on volleyball and high school.  Synopsis  This series is based on high school life, love, and one sport - volleyball. When Mia (Vivien Yeo) was young, she and her sisters, Ah Kiu (Charmaine Li), and Yan Yan (Yoyo Chen) met a fortune teller. Mia was given a bag and told to open it when she turns 18 and it would guide her to her true love. The fortune teller told her to choose carefully so she wouldn't hurt her family. Mia and her sisters buried the bag in a box and promised not to open it until Mia turned 18. Mia stayed with her aunt in New York City while the Ah Kiu and Yan Yan went back to Hong Kong. 10 years later... Mia goes back to Hong Kong and on her 18th birthday, the sisters dig up the time capsule and read the notes. The letter inside the bag reads that Mia's true love would have a four leaf- clover birthmark on him. Mia was happy when she discovers that Ah Sun (Charles Szeto), the most popular guy in school who is also the star volleyball player, has the four-leaf clover mark on his shoulder. Yan Yan then decides that Mia should join the school's beach volleyball team so that Ah Sun will notice her. In order to do so, they go through different schemes and fail until they get Ah Kiu to help them, pretending to be Mia and playing amazingly at volleyball while Ah Sun is watching. Ah Sun, of course being the captain of the volleyball team, decides to recommend the \\"amazing\\" volleyball player Mia into the team. Ah Sun slowly develops a love for Mia thinking she is a beautiful girl in his school who shares his love of volleyball, both interest and skill wise. Soon after, Mia and Ah Sun start dating. Though they could trick Ah Sun once, they cannot do the same thing during practice, therefore leading a very suspicious coach and teammates into their hands. Dealing with the school's most popular girl, Eugene, and her buddies, Yan Yan and Mia play a game of volleyball against them. Ah Kiu coming to the rescue just in time, beats Eugene for them, earning her a direct pass into the volleyball team. Mia's volleyball playing days do not last long for after a few practices the coach decides to get rid of her as well. However, Ah Sun comes to the rescue and declares that her ability to play amazingly is not at its best level since she injured herself in a game. Negotiating with the coach, Ah Sun helps Mia stay on the team as the second manager. In a series of events the Yip sisters soon discover another guy in their school bearing the four-leaf clover birthmark. This guy is the school's rumored bad boy Nic Fong (Vin Choi). Though she has begun dating Ah Sun, Mia discovers that her mind always trails back to Nic. Furthermore, she tells him to join the volleyball team in response to hearing him confess that he's been secretly watching her dance after school and how beautiful he thought she was. She was convinced by her sisters that she should tell him to join the team so that she can have a chance to be close to him and see if he was the guy for her instead of Ah Sun. The story continues in complication as Ah Kiu begins to realize that she has liked Ah Sun from the beginning. Though she has always believed that she is unlike the normal bubbly girl that is head over heals for a popular pretty boy like Ah Sun, her jealousy towards Mia and Ah Sun's relationship grows as they become closer. Though the best friend of Ah Sun, Ah Kit, repeatedly reminds her that his love for her is never ending, she does not respond to it and only becomes more and more jealous and miserable.

Although a sensible person, he is easily depressed. He has the ability to change his appearance or impersonate people, regardless of their gender.

Finjan claims to own patented technology used in enterprise web security tools. Formerly a publicly traded company on NASDAQ (FNJN), it was acquired by the Fortress Investment Group in 2020. Finjan has filed a large number of lawsuits against leading software security companies asserting its patents including against: Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, Symantec, Blue Coat Systems, Sophos, Trend Micro, ESET, Bitdefender, Check Point , Qualys, Rapid7, Fortinet and others. As such, Finjan has been named a Patent troll.http://techrights.org/2018/01/21/finjan-swpats-hype/ The original hardware and software divisions of Finjan were acquired by M86 Security in 2009. Finjan continues to hold patents for various Web security technologies and licenses these patents to Trustwave (formerly M86) among others. Finjan's commitment to innovation in the security space continues through its investments which have culminated in the recent launch of Finjan's consulting services business, CybeRisk development of mobile applications for the consumer through its subsidiary Finjan Mobile and incubation of up-and-coming technology startups pioneering a new generation of security technologies through the company's investment in Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP) Fund VII's Cyber Labs, having invested alongside companies like Cisco and other technology companies. The company is headquartered in East Palo Alto, California.http://www.linkedin.com/companies/finjan History Finjan was founded in 1997 by Shlomo Touboul, a serial entrepreneur who founded his first company, Shani Computers, in 1985 and sold it to Intel in 1994. He then worked for Intel for a while, before starting Finjan. In 1998 Touboul decided to bring in an experienced seasoned CEO, who would be able to develop and grow the company more quickly, he then left to start his own venture capital fund. In 2001, the company ran into financial difficulties and Touboul was asked by the board of directors to rejoin the company as CEO. Touboul realigned the company's strategy, moving away from developing only software solutions to combined hardware and software security appliances; additionally, the company moved to a channel sales model. In December 2002 Finjan acquired the assets of Alchemedia, a software developer with a DRM product called Clever Content, and several DRM patents; Alchemedia also had ties to Israel, as its founder Daniel Schreiber was Israeli, though the company was technically headquartered in the Dallas area. In 2005, following disagreements with the board, Touboul left again and started a new company Yoggie Security Systems. In October 2007 Eric Benhamou, former CEO and chairman of 3COM, was appointed as chairman of Finjan. He also invested in the company through his venture capital fund - Benhamou Global Ventures. In November 2009 the hardware and software divisions of Finjan were sold to M86 Security, a global computer security firm based in Orange, California with international headquarters in London and offices worldwide. M86 was subsequently acquired by Trustwave, who still use Finjan's technology patents under a licensing agreement.M86 Security Acquires Finjan Reuters Finjan appliances are now sold as Trustwave Secure Web Gateway. In June 2013, Finjan became a publicly traded company capitalized with $30M, installed a new management team, and began a more focused program to license the Company's landmark intellectual property. In May 2014, Finjan was listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the trading symbol \\"FNJN\\" where we continue to trade today. Investors Finjan's initial shareholders included Cisco, Microsoft, Bessemer Venture Partners, Benchmark Capital, HarbourVest Partners and Israel Seed Partners. In November 2008, the company secured an additional investment of $22M, which brought the total capital invested in Finjan since its founding to $67 million.

In May 2014, Finjan was listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the trading symbol \\"FNJN\\".  Finjan's patent litigation practices  Finjan is known to engage in dubious litigation practices. In one case (Finjan v. Check Point), Finjan's attorney filed a false declaration stating she had personal knowledge of certain facts, which the court found to be \\"problematic\\". The court then took the drastic measure of striking this declaration. In another case (Finjan v. Juniper), the district Judge found that Finjan's attorney made an \\"absolutely false statement\\" and concluded in saying \\"I spent some time on this. And it turns out it was just BS. It was just big firm BS.\\" In the same case, Finjan provided sworn testimony that it had put Juniper on notice of infringing its patent in a phone call. During trial, in front of the jury, when it was discovered that this phone call was (legally) recorded, Finjan's witness admitted that this sworn testimony was untrue. Remarkably, Finjan's witness further admitted on cross-examination at trial that, if it weren‚Äôt for the recording, he would still be testifying that proper notice of infringement was given. > Q.

In 2000 he won the Pulitzer Prize for newspaper feature writing.J.R. Moehringer biography - Pulitzer Board Biography Moehringer was born in New York City and was raised by a single mother in Manhasset, New York and, later, in Scottsdale, Arizona. He graduated from Saguaro High School in Scottsdale in 1982. He graduated from Yale University in 1986. He began his journalism career as a news assistant at The New York Times. In 1990, he moved to Breckenridge, Colorado, and worked at the Rocky Mountain News. In 1994, he became a reporter for the Orange County bureau of the Los Angeles Times. In 1997, the Los Angeles Times sent him to Atlanta to report on the South as an on-the-scene reporter. His work as a journalist later took him to Denver, Colorado. He was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in Feature Writing in 1998 and received the Pulitzer in 2000. Works Moehringer's memoir, The Tender Bar, was published in 2005. It recounts his childhood through his early twenties and tells of his coming-of-age experiences at a local bar called Publicans (previously called Dickens, and subsequently renamed Edison's), which served as a sanctuary away from his chaotic family life. After retired tennis star Andre Agassi read The Tender Bar, he asked Moehringer to collaborate with him on his own memoir. The resulting book, which was titled Open: An Autobiography, was published in 2009. Moehringer wrote an article for the Los Angeles Times Magazine about a homeless man who claimed he was Bob Satterfield. In 2007, the article was adapted as the basis of a film Resurrecting the Champ. The film was directed by Rod Lurie and starred Samuel L. Jackson, Josh Hartnett, and Alan Alda. His novel, Sutton, based on the life of bank robber Willie Sutton, was published in 2012. He ghostwrote Phil Knight's memoir, Shoe Dog, published in 2016.

It has been given a number of English names, including Abyssinian gladiolus and fragrant gladiolus. It was formerly placed in the genus Acidanthera. It is a cormous perennial growing to tall, with linear leaves and in late summer, numerous fragrant white flowers with a maroon (occasionally orange) blotch in the throat, on slender nodding stems. Widely cultivated, it is a common subject in western and southern European gardens, where the corms are lifted every year and stored in frost-free conditions. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Hardiness: Zones 7‚Äì10 (6b with deep planting and mulching) Taxonomy The species was first described as Acidanthera bicolor by Christian Hochstetter in 1844. In 1973, Wessel Marais included the genus Acidanthera in Gladiolus. As the name Gladiolus bicolor had already been published by John Gilbert Baker in 1877 for a different species of Gladiolus, Marais needed another name. He chose to call the species Gladiolus callianthus. Marais was apparently unaware that James Kelway had already published the name Gladiolus murielae in 1932, so that the name \\"G. callianthus\\" was superfluous. The epithet murielae honours Muriel Erskine; her husband had collected in Ethiopia the specimen on which Kelway based the name. The species is often still offered for sale under the name Acidanthera bicolor, sometimes with murielae added as an infraspecific name, or even as the cultivar name 'Murielae'.

The jackets of these bullets are generally made out of copper alloy (such as gilding metal or cupronickel) The very-low-drag bullet (VLD) is primarily a small arms ballistics development of the 1980s‚Äì1990s, driven by shooters' desire for bullets that will give a higher degree of accuracy and kinetic efficiency, especially at extended ranges. To achieve this, the projectile must minimize air resistance in flight. Demand has been greatest from military snipers and long range target shooters, including F-class and benchrest competitors, but hunters have also benefited. Most VLD bullets are used in rifles. VLD bullets typically have a ballistic coefficient greater than 0.5, although the threshold is undefined. Bullets with a lower drag coefficient decelerate less rapidly. A low drag coefficient flattens the projectile's trajectory and also markedly decreases the lateral drift caused by crosswinds. The higher impact velocity of bullets with low drag coefficients means they retain more kinetic energy. Development VLD bullets are long and heavy for their diameter to achieve a high sectional density. Development of VLD bullets has focused on reducing a form factor defined as the sectional density divided by the ballistic coefficient. Form factor can be minimized by: * bullet nose design incorporating a secant ogive, tangent ogive, Von K√°rm√°n ogive or Sears-Haack profile * the use of tapered bullet heels, also known as boat-tails * a cavity or hollow in the bullet nose (hollow point) to reduce weight while shifting the projectile's centre of gravity rearwards to improve stability with concentric and coincident centre of pressure and centre of mass The resulting projectile should be streamlined for easier passage through the air. Consistency in bullet production, allied to consistency in the assembly of cartridges (quality control) should give excellent shot-to-shot consistency. The principles of bullet design and flight are classically set out in Franklin Ware Mann's The Bullet's Flight From Powder to Target: Ballistics of Small Arms.* Mann, F.W.: The Bullet's Flight From Powder to Target: Ballistics of Small Arms (1942 and other reprints) Mono-metal designs Machining mono- metal bullets (coreless bullets made of one single metal (alloy)) offers bullet designers the freedom to design slender, aerodynamically efficient shapes that cannot be produced with more traditional bullet production methods. Professional quality control during and after production is needed to guarantee the bullets' consistency and accuracy. Mono-metal solid bullets are more expensive than traditional jacketed hollow point boat tail VLD bullets. To reduce damage to the employed barrel and increase muzzle velocity, some modern mono-metal VLD bullets are bore-riding bullets, in which thin driving bands are the only parts that are etched by the barrel's lands. The use of driving bands originates from artillery shells and to use these driving bands correctly requires projectiles and barrels to be precision-fitted to each other. Mono-metal VLD bullets are normally machined from solid bars of highly- machinable metals or alloys using CNC lathes. Common materials include UNS C36000 Free-Cutting Brass, lead-free brass,Wieland-SW1 lead-free special brass oxygen-free copper and other highly machinable alloys of copper, nickel, and tellurium.

Ending of CAT support  In April 2008, Caterpillar announced a change in vision. In developing the new DBSi system strategy, multiple areas were considered such as: * A thorough review of dealer needs five to seven years into the future * An assessment of the long-term financial viability of continuing DBSi development for 80‚Äì100 dealers * A review of 3rd party dealer management systems offered in the marketplace * Recent dealer evaluations and decisions to leave DBS/DBSi With this accomplished, consensus from all parties involved resulted in the completion of a new DBSi system strategy. Together, it was concluded that systems from outside providers such as Microsoft, Infor and SAP could meet Caterpillar dealers needs and that continued investments in DBSi to compete with these systems is no longer a viable option for either Caterpillar or the dealers. Since this time Accenture has taken over development of DBS / DBSi. This application runs on AS/400 minicomputers locally in dealers' data centers, and connect to CAT systems to place orders.

Being unable to compete with the one-cent fare adopted by the Brooklyn Union Ferry Company in November 1850, it was sold to the new Union Ferry Company of Brooklyn (the successor to the Brooklyn Union) in December 1853. George Law's Brooklyn Ferry Company introduced a ferry between James Slip and South Tenth Street in Williamsburg on May 4, 1857. Effective March 28, 1859, the Brooklyn landing of the ferry was moved from South Tenth Street to Broadway, where the company's Division Avenue Ferry landed. The Union Ferry Company stopped running the Roosevelt Street-Bridge Street route in 1859, and sold the Roosevelt Slip to the Brooklyn Ferry Company, which moved its Broadway-James Slip ferry to Roosevelt later that year. In early 1860, the Brooklyn Ferry Company and the Long Island Ferry Company (Peck Slip Ferry) agreed to consolidate operations, and the Peck Slip route was abandoned in late 1860.

Overview of Sailing Directions coverage. The numbers in the squares indicate the individual Planning Guide coverage areas. Sailing Directions are written directions that describe the routes to be taken by boats and ships during coastal navigation and port approaches. There are also products known as Sailing Directions, which are books written by various Hydrographic Offices throughout the world. They are known as Pilot Books, because they provide local knowledge of routes and landmarks, which would typically be provided by a local marine pilot. As such, they are used frequently by naval and government vessels, who are exempted from 'Compulsory Pilotage' in many ports. Many nations publish Sailing Directions for their home waters, where they are the International Hydrographic Organization's (IHO) primary charting authority. However, the most widely used Sailing Directions product is the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office's, 'Admiralty Sailing directions' (ASDs)( a.k.a. Pilot books). The ASDs, sold under the Admiralty brand, provide the most comprehensive geographic coverage of coastal routes worldwide. They are designed to supplement and enhance the data shown on British Admiralty Nautical Charts, by describing routes for seagoing vessels, relative to coastal features. Ocean routes are covered by the Admiralty book 'Ocean Passages for The World' (Abbrev. OPTW. Nautical Publication NP136), which describes Offshore routes separately for power driven vessels, and low powered / sailing vessels.  American Sailing Directions  There is a 42-volume American navigation publication published by the National Geospatial- Intelligence Agency (NGA). Sailing Directions consists of 37 Enroute volumes, 4 Planning Guide volumes, and 1 volume combining both types. Planning Guides describe general features of ocean basins and country-specific information such as firing areas, pilotage requirements, regulations, search and rescue information, ship reporting systems, and time zones; routes describe features of coastlines, ports, and harbors. The American Sailing Directions are available for free download, via the NGA MSI Portal Also, via the Office of Coastal Survey's website, as well as other products, including charts. Sailing Directions are updated when new data requires extensive revision of an existing text. These data are obtained from several sources, including pilots and Sailing Directions from other countries. One book comprises the Planning Guide and for Antarctica. This consolidation allows for a more effective presentation of material on this unique area. Sailing Directions (Planning Guide) and Sailing Directions (Enroute) are frequently updated. In early 2005, NGA discontinued production of these publications in printed form; subsequent editions were distributed in digital form only. Between editions, Sailing Directions are corrected via a binary patch process referred to as Publication Data Update (PDU). Figure 1 shows an overview of Sailing Directions coverage. Planning Guide Figure 2. Planning Guide page. Planning Guide volumes assist the navigator in planning an extensive oceanic voyage, and give information on individual countries that is applicable to all ports in those countries. Each of the Planning Guides covers an area determined by an arbitrary division of the world's seas. Individual Planning Guides are divided into Countries and Ocean Basins, as follows: #Pub. 120‚Äî51 Countries and 1 Ocean Basin (Pacific Ocean). #Pub. 140‚Äî87 Countries and 6 Ocean Basins (Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caribbean Sea, Mediterranean Sea, North Atlantic Ocean, and North Sea/English Channel). #Pub. 160‚Äî61 Countries and 3 Ocean Basins (Indian Ocean, South Atlantic Ocean, and Red Sea/Persian Gulf). #Pub. 180‚Äî5 Countries and 1 Ocean Basin (Arctic Ocean). Country entries may contain information on the following subjects‚Äîbuoyage systems, currency, firing areas, fishing areas, government, holidays, ice, industries, languages, mined areas, navigational information (to include maritime claims, maritime boundary disputes, and enroute volumes), offshore drilling, pilotage, pollution, prohibited areas, regulations, restricted areas, search and rescue, signals, submarine operating areas, time zone, traffic separation schemes, U.S. embassy, and vessel traffic services. Information that cannot be accurately depicted within the alphabeticized country text may be listed as an appendix at the end of the country text. Ocean casin entries may contain information on the following subjects‚Äîclimatology, currents, fishing areas, geophysical features, ice, ionospheric disturbance, magnetic field, meteorology, mined areas, navigational information, optical phenomena, pilotage, pollution, regulations, routes, seas, ship reporting systems, tides, and surface temperatures. Enroute Each Enroute volume contains numbered sectors along a coast or through a strait. Each sector is discussed in turn. A preface with detailed information about authorities, references, and conventions used in each book precedes the sector discussions. A table showing conversions between feet, fathoms, and meters is provided. Finally, each volume provides a list of commonly used abbreviations that may be found in the text. The chart information graphics, the first items in each sector, are a graphic key for charts and digital nautical charts (DNC) pertaining to a sector. The graduation of the border scale of the chartlets enable navigators to identify the largest scale chart for a location and to find a feature listed in the index-gazetteer. A foreign terms glossary and a comprehensive index-gazetteer follow the sector discussions. The index-gazetteer is an alphabetical listing of described and charted features. The index-gazetteer lists each feature by geographic coordinates and sector-paragraph number.

Its name translates as Boardgame World. It contains online versions of over 70 popular classical and modern board games and card games, such as Backgammon, Bluff, Carcassonne, Can't Stop, Go, Settlers of Catan, and Tichu. A Java-enabled browser is required to play, and registering with the site is not required (though recommended, as many players will not play with unregistered users). All major aspects of the Java client, games and website are also available in English. The site is independent and free from advertising, except for indirectly advertising the games themselves. As a result of the site's popularity, some board game publishers have presented new board games on BrettspielWelt before they are first published. All players begin (by default) in the game manager, which is used by players from many countries. New players having difficulty getting started can introduce themselves to one of the English-speaking communities for advice and help. BSW offers a system for implementing translations. History BrettspielWelt started in 1998 as a project by Alexander Zbiek to play board games with his friends over the internet. The first version ran on a workstation in the Leibniz computing centre in Munich. Zbiek then teamed up with Regina Michl, Tobias Lang and Sebastian Mellin. After making the program more stable and expandable, it was released to the public in 2000. It was merged with Copco company in 2008 and eventually became one company. Community BrettspielWelt has an optional meta-game for its members, in which each game played earns experience points, credits and resources for the player. The metagame facilitates the building of smaller communities, set up as towns, in which players can meet, chat and play. As a player increases in rank and their virtual wealth increases, they may build a virtual home in the online \\"world\\" that includes games that earn credits and resources for the community. There is a large contingent of English BrettspielWelt players, and several towns aimed primarily at English speakers. These include Concordia, EnglishTown, Smallville, BurgundyRidge, and The.Great.White.North (primarily aimed at Canadians), as well as the multilingual Emerald.City, Whitechapel and PiratesCove.

The main house is built around three courtyards lying on an east‚Äìwest axis and is approximately 80,000 square feet in area. It is acknowledged as the finest example of Jacobean stately home and one of Britains ten best palaces.https://www.historyextra.com/period/tudor/britains-10-best-palaces/ The building successive alterations are attributed to three major architects : John Thorpe (1565-1655) for the Jacobean royal extension, Roger Morris (1695-1749) for the Neo-Palladian modifications, and, Sir Reginald Blomfield (1856-1942) for the formal gardens and the Neo-Jacobean embellishments. The Lebanese cedar planted in 1614 is a scheduled monument considered as the oldest surviving one in England. Apethorpe holds a particularly important place in English history because of its ownership by, and role in entertaining, Tudor and Stuart monarchs. Elizabeth I inherited the estate from her father Henry VIII. Her successor James I personally contributed to its extension resulting in a set of impressive state rooms featuring some of the most important surviving plasterwork and fireplaces of the period. There were at least thirteen extended royal visits from the Stuart kings ‚Äì more than to any other house in the country ‚Äì between 1603 and 1636, and it was at Apethorpe that James met George Villiers, his favourite, later to become Duke of Buckingham. A series of court masques written by Ben Jonson for James I were performed while the King was in residence at Apethorpe.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage (1923) vol. IV, 83 The house was also lived in regularly by Charles I. In 1622 King James financed an enlargement of the house and rebuilding of the south range with a new suite of state rooms on the first floor, and an open gallery around the perimeter of the house on the second floor. This suite of state rooms consisted of the Dining Chamber, the Drawing Chamber, the King Bedchamber, the Prince of Wales Bedchamber (with the three feathers carved on the fireplace) and the Long Gallery (last complete set of original Jacobean State apartments left in England). The entrance is still now surmounted by a statue of James I dating from that period. The King Bedchamber was embellished with a hunting scene over the fireplace and the royal arms decorated the ceiling. These State rooms contain a notable series of fireplaces incorporating in the carving iconographical statements such as the nature of kingship. History =Early history= Apethorpe House in 1829 In May 1231 Henry III granted the manor of Apethorpe to Ralph le Breton; however on 21 June 1232 the manor was taken back into the king's hands. In the 15th century the manor was owned by Sir Guy Wolston. In 1515 Apethorpe was purchased by Henry Keble, grandfather of Lord Mountjoy, who sold the manor to Henry VIII. Apethorpe was left to Princess Elizabeth in her father's Henry VIII's will. In April 1551 Sir Walter Mildmay acquired it from Edward VI in exchange for property in Gloucestershire and Berkshire. Queen Elizabeth dined with Mildmay at Apethorpe on her progress in 1562, 1566 and 1587. He added a stone chimney-piece with her words engraved dated 1562, and after his death it was inherited by his eldest son Sir Anthony Mildmay (c. 1549‚Äì1617), from whom Apethorpe passed to his daughter Mary (1581/2‚Äì1640) and her husband, Sir Francis Fane (1617), later Earl of Westmorland. Apethorpe remained in the Fane family for nearly three centuries. =Modern history= Apethorpe Palace ‚Äì Eastern Courtyard The interior of Apethorpe Palace The 12th Earl and his son, the 13th Earl, came into financial difficulties and, in 1904, the family seat was sold to Henry Brassey. After World War II much of the adjoining estate was sold and the house became an approved school under the Catholic Church. In 1982 the school closed and in 1983 the building was sold to Wanis Mohamed Burweila, who wanted to found a university in the cloisters and courtyards of Apethorpe. His plans never materialised and he left the country for political reasons. As the house was empty, when English Heritage started its Buildings at Risk Register in 1998, the house was included on it as one of the most important houses at risk. In September 2004 the entire estate was compulsorily purchased by the British Government under section 47 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (only the second time the government has had to use these powers). English Heritage has spent ¬£8 million refurbishing it to make it waterproof. Much of the work was carried out by Stamford restoration and conservation builders, E. Bowman & Sons Ltd. From 2007, buyers were sought, in spite of an estimated ¬£6 million still required in renovation (as of 2014, the house was without any plumbing, power or heating). In 2008, the asking price was upwards of ¬£4.5 million. In December 2014, English Heritage announced that Baron von Pfetten, a French anglophile and keen field sportsman, had bought the property. Simon Thurley, English Heritage's chief executive, welcomed the purchase: \\"Since 2000 English Heritage has consistently said that the best solution for Apethorpe is for it to be taken on by a single owner, who wants to continue to restore the house and to live in it; especially one who has experience of restoring historic buildings and is prepared to share its joys with a wide public, as Baron Pfetten will do. Apethorpe is certainly on a par with Hatfield and Knole and is by far the most important country house to have been threatened with major loss through decay since the 1950s.\\" Baron Pfetten has agreed to an 80-year commitment of 50 days public opening a year, a far more extensive undertaking than the normal period of 10 years in the case of English Heritage grant-aided properties. Before the sale English Heritage and the new owner agreed to rename the house \\"Apethorpe Palace\\" due to its royal ownership and use, along with its outstanding historic and architectural significance. In a video introducing the sale, English Heritage director Simon Thurley described the house as \\"the Royal Palace of Apethorpe.\\" Since April 2015, the house is officially registered as Apethorpe Palace in the National Heritage List. Since 2015 the palace has been undergoing huge internal renovation works https://www.houseandgarden.co.uk:gallery/apethorpe-palace and with a few royal visits is now starting to regain its right place in British history.https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jun/13/red-barons-jacobean- apethorpe-palace-marks-its-rebirth-with- partyhttps://www.sarahfarnsworth.co.uk/p925498750 Film location The house has been used for filming scenes in Another Country and Porterhouse Blue.

Most of the teaching staffs for both schools were retained and the transition continued throughout the 1950s. B.W. Harris Episcopal Elementary and Junior High School officially opened on June 29, 1960 under the leadership of Mr. Emmanuel W. Johnson. There were then a total of 250 students in classes through eighth grade. An additional grade was added every year. The school's first graduating class consisted of 6 students in 1966. St. Thomas Church pulled out of the consolidated system in 1964, but the school continued to grow. An annex building accommodating the science laboratory, library and other facilities was constructed in 1965, funded by a donation of $65,000 from the Episcopal Church Women (ECW) in the United States. The school's largely stable Board of Trustees saw dissolution in 1985 and a new board installed in 1986. In 1990, the First Liberian Civil War forced the school to close. Many of the buildings survived but a significant portion of the school's infrastructure was looted. The school reopened in 1993 under principal Reverend Father Dee Wellington Bright offering classes to grades 1-9 and the school obtained a hundred percent pass in the grade 9 National Exams in that year. The kindergarten division was rehabilitated in 1994, as was the grade 10 with additional grades added each subsequent year. The school was forced to close down again in 1996 due to the April war in Monrovia, when looting again made away with many school materials. A tutorial program was run in August 1997 and regular classes resumed for the 1997-1998 academic year. In December 1997, Mrs. Gertrude Findley was appointed as Principal. The first class of 33 post-war graduates was produced in June 1998.

He is a main character in a series of adventures centering on historical mysteries and treasures. As a museum and government employee, Pan Samochodzik not only has to discover treasures, but protect them from thieves. His nickname comes from his fantastic (heavily customized) automobile. Characters =Pan Samochodzik= Pan Samochodzik, a.k.a. Tomasz N.N., is an employee of the fictional \\"Department of Artifact Protection\\" in the Polish Ministry of Culture and Art. He is a special envoy with extensive knowledge in the areas of history, riddle-solving, finding treasures and protecting them from thieves. As such, he is sometimes called a Polish version of Robert Langdon, Dirk Pitt or Indiana Jones. His nickname, Pan Samochodzik (Polish for \\"Mr. Automobile\\"; French (this version also appeared in one of the books): \\"Monsieur La Bangnolette\\"), comes from his unique vehicle: a heavily modified by his uncle Ferrari 410 SuperAmerica (a wreck after a serious car crash on the way to Zakopane; the only thing that remained functional was the engine - Mr Automobile's uncle bought it and installed in his self-constructed vehicle). The car can reach a very high speed and is capable of traversing water and difficult terrain. Many people perceived this vehicle as ugly because of its dubledore-like design. His other name, Tomasz N.N., comes from the author's real name, Zbigniew Tomasz Nowicki, the second \\"N\\" representing his adopted surname, Nienacki. =Allies= Pan Samochodzik is sometimes accompanied by youngsters ‚Äî often Polish Boy Scouts. Novels written by authors other than Nienacki also feature Pawe≈Ç Daniec, a young art historian, ex- commando and sidekick of Samochodzik. =Villains= Pan Samochodzik's nemesis is Waldemar Batura, former art historian, smuggler and thief. Novels written by authors other than Nienacki feature Jerzy Batura, new villain, son and successor of Waldemar. Novels =Original Nienacki novels= Note: The dates of the following novels may be inaccurate, as some of them may have been published in a different order than they were written. In the first three novels (Pozwolenie na przyw√≥z lwa, 'Skarb Atanaryka and Uroczysko), Pan Samochodzik is a journalist, not a government employee. In the 1990s, Nienacki rewrote those three books so they would be consistent with the series. The books were released by various publishers, and it was not until 1987 that a single publisher (Pojezierze) decided to rerelease the series in one graphical design. * Pozwolenie na przyw√≥z lwa ‚Äî Permit for the transport of a lion (new title: Pierwsza przygoda Pana Samochodzika ‚Äî First Adventure of Pan Samochodzik) (1961) * Skarb Atanaryka ‚Äî The Treasure of Athanaric (new title: Pan Samochodzik i skarb Atanaryka ‚Äî Pan Samochodzik and the Treasure of Athanaric) (1960) * Uroczysko ‚Äî Sacred place (new title: Pan Samochodzik i ≈õwiƒôty relikwiarz ‚Äî Pan Samochodzik and the Holy Reliquary) (1957) * Wyspa Z≈Çoczy≈Ñc√≥w ‚Äî The Island of Villains (new title: Pan Samochodzik i Wyspa Z≈Çoczy≈Ñc√≥w ‚Äî Pan Samochodzik and the Island of Villains) (1964) * Pan Samochodzik i templariusze ‚Äî Pan samochodzik and the Knights Templar (1966) * Niesamowity dw√≥r ‚Äî Unearthly Mansion (new title: Pan Samochodzik i niesamowity dw√≥r ‚Äî Pan Samochodzik and the Unearthly Mansion) (1970) * Nowe przygody Pana Samochodzika ‚Äî New Adventures of Pan Samochodzik (new title: Pan Samochodzik i Kapitan Nemo ‚Äî Pan Samochodzik and Captain Nemo) (1970) * Pan Samochodzik i Fantomas ‚Äî Pan Samochodzik and Fant√¥mas (1973) * Pan Samochodzik i zagadki Fromborka ‚Äî Pan Samochodzik and the Riddles of Frombork (1972) * Ksiƒôga strach√≥w ‚Äî The Book of Fear (new title: Pan Samochodzik i dziwne szachownice ‚Äî Pan Samochodzik and Strange Checkerboards) (1967) * Pan Samochodzik i tajemnica tajemnic ‚Äî Pan Samochodzik and the Secret of Secrets (1975) * Pan Samochodzik i Winnetou ‚Äî Pan Samochodzik and Winnetou (1976) * Pan Samochodzik i Niewidzialni ‚Äî Pan Samochodzik and the Invisible (1977) * Pan Samochodzik i z≈Çota rƒôkawica ‚Äî Pan Samochodzik and the Golden Gauntlet (1979) * Pan Samochodzik i cz≈Çowiek z UFO ‚Äî Pan Samochodzik and the Man from UFO (new title: Pan Samochodzik i Nie≈õmiertelny ‚Äî Pan Samochodzik and the Immortal) (1985) =Nienacki novels completed by Jerzy Ignaciuk= * Pan Samochodzik i nieuchwytny kolekcjoner (1997) (Only partially written, completed by Jerzy Ignaciuk) * Pan Samochodzik i...

The new novels take place in post-communist Poland, introduce two new main characters (the sidekick Pawe≈Ç Daniec and villain Jerzy Batura), and in the newest book, replace the old vehicle with a new, jeep-based, variant. * Pan Samochodzik i...

The grenade was a badge common to all fusilier regiments, while the other elements were each taken from the cap badges of the three regiments.A L Kipling and H L King, Head-dress badges of the British Army, Volume 2, London, 1979 The regiments were distinguished by a coloured feather hackle worn behind the badge in some forms of head dress: red and white (Royal Northumberland Fusiliers), white (Royal Fusiliers), or primrose yellow (Lancashire Fusiliers) respectively. From 1960 the Fusilier Brigade was based at St George's Barracks in Sutton Coldfield. In 1962 the Forester Brigade was dissolved and the Royal Warwickshire Regiment was transferred to the Fusilier Brigade, being retitled the Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers in the following year, and adopting a hackle in the regimental colours of orange and royal blue. A new button was designed for the Brigade in 1963, bearing the ancient antelope badge of the Royal Warwickshires within The Garter.Howard Ripley, Buttons of the British Army 1855 - 1970, London, 1979 On 23 April 1968, (St George's Day) all four regiments were amalgamated into the single \\"large regiment\\", the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. The RRF continues to wear the Fusilier Brigade badges and buttons, with the red over white hackle of the Northumberland Fusiliers. On 1 July 1968 the Fusilier Brigade was united with the Home Counties Brigade and East Anglian Brigades, to form the Queen's Division.Whitaker's Almanack 1969, p. 473 References External links * Fusilier Brigade (regiments.org) Category:Infantry administrative brigades of the British Army Category:Military units and formations established in 1958 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1968 Category:1958 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Fusilier Brigade"},{"id":"9893670","text":"Bruce Barrymore Halpenny (1937 ‚Äì 3 May 2015) was an English military historian and author, specialising in airfields and aircraft, as well as ghost stories and mysteries. He was also a broadcasterFramlington Times - Journal of the 390th Bomb Group Memorial Air Museum ‚Äì ISSUE 21, September, 1989 - page24 and games inventor. Parents Halpenny's father was a Canadian First World War soldier who fought at Vimy Ridge, and his mother a British First World War munitions worker from Lincolnshire. Bruce is from Lincolnshire, England. Military career Halpenny served in the Royal Air Force Police (RAFP) in specialist units, often overseas. After being wounded, he moved across to the RAF Police on Special Security Duties (Atomic & Chemical Weapons), and was part of a special RAF military police unit on Special Duties and in the Nuclear Division, responsible for protecting the nuclear weapons used by the V bombers in times of war.The Avro Vulcan Adventure - ANZIO - 2007 - Literary career In the 1950s whilst in the Royal Air Force, he was wounded and had to undergo several operations, in which his life was in the balance as dedicated surgeons fought to not only save his hand and arm, but also his life. In rehabilitation, he started writing and research as a hobby, and though he stayed in the RAF and was to serve on Special Duties and in the Nuclear Division, his hobby turned into a profession in later years after leaving the forces. =Early years= In the early period of his writing career, he started out by writing love stories and cowboy stories for the American market under pen names. Then, because of his specialist knowledge of the Royal Air Force, he focused on military history, especially RAF history of World War Two, often with deep insights, facts and personal human interest stories.Hamburg Raid 1943 ‚Äì WAR monthly ‚Äì September 1981 - pages 14‚Äì17 At one time, he was writing articles for up to 14 military journals around the world, when he was approached by the publishers Patrick Stephens to do the Airfield books due to his vast knowledge and authority. =Military history= When he researched the British RAF airfield histories, particularly those of London, Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, Halpenny found that public records held very little, if any, information at all, so he had to do all the research himself going back to the very beginning. This helped to unearth a rich source of information, which others have since used, but set Halpenny as an undisputed RAF expert. For his research on the airfields, Halpenny interviewed 1,400 people, researched records and letters, and travelled thousands of miles. Such was his dedication to the history of the airfields that he visited each and every airfield, (some of which he had prior knowledge of from his military days), to ensure accuracy. His books quickly became essential reference books for all aviation historians. Virtually all of the information was new, in the sense that it hadn't appeared in the dozens of books which had been written about the RAF, new too were the many photographs that were just a selection of the thousands he collected and commissioned. Such were his photographs and uniqueness, and the way that he used them, that in the opening chapters of his book Action Stations 2 Wartime Military Airfields of Lincolnshire and the East Midlands, were a selection of control tower photos ‚Äì this was the first time this had been done in any book.Aviation Bookshelf ‚Äì Action Stations 2 Wartime Military Airfields of Lincolnshire and the East Midlands ‚Äì Air Pictorial ‚Äì September 1981 He also wrote various military themed books from such as English Electrical/BAC Lightning to Wartime Poems. He specialised in the British jets, English Electric Lightning, English Electric Canberra and Avro Vulcan. =Ghosts and mysteries= Halpenny had been writing ghost stories in the 1960s, and encountering ghost stories in his exhaustive research into airfield histories, when in 1984 he decided they should form the subject of a special book, and so started to add to, and research his 'ghost-mystery' files about abandoned airfields that murmur and whisper with ghosts. By 1984, he had become acknowledged as not only a respected British military historian, expert in airfield histories, but also the expert in RAF Ghosts, especially surrounding airfields.Ghosts of War ‚Äì by Ken Livemore - Titbits ‚Äì Summer Special 1984, pages 42‚Äì43 Ghost Stations was born, and in 1986 the first book was published, and proved a best seller as it recounts how \\"headless airmen and other spectres have appeared in control towers and other Service buildings throughout the country\\". Such was demand that a second book entitled, Aaargh! was published with over 30 stories, one of which was The eerie mystery of Lightning 894. Aaargh!, was later to become Ghost Stations 2, as more books later followed over the years, and became the cult series of Ghost Stations books. Halpenny's unique knowledge and position meant that he was also known for accessing and finding information generally closed to the general public and media, especially Ministry of Defence (MoD) material concerning UFOs. Halpenny always maintained that all airfields are haunted.Halpenny, Bruce Barrymore ‚Äì Ghost Stations Over the years, he uncovered a wealth of material about ghostly experiences on wartime airfields. \\"The evidence of ghosts keeps popping up and is so rich that it cannot be ignored,\\" he said and he had little doubt why airfields are such a magnet for ghosts, \\"You have to remember that 55,000 men of Bomber Command died while operating from Britain in World War Two, and almost all of them met a violent end, so it isn't surprising that dozens of earthbound spirits have been left behind.\\" Games inventor Halpenny was also a games inventor, and created The Great Train Robbery board game in the 1970s. It was used as a prize on shows such as Tiswas and Crackerjack.ANZIO Board Games Charities, causes and animal rights Halpenny was always vocal in his campaigns for numerous organisations and causes, especially concerning veterans, war widows, wounded and invalided servicemen and women. He also helped schools and children's charities such as Mencap, in campaigning and highlighting issues, and even in one case when he donated a vintage bottle of wine to help raise funds. The bottle was unique in that it was the last bottle remaining after the Nazis had plundered the cellars of families living in an Italian Abruzzo village in World War II. The author's uncle was a Canadian tank commander whose tank was the first to liberate the village, and was also the first tank to enter Ortona in the Battle of Ortona.Regione Abruzzo. Servizio Sviluppo del Turismo - 1943/44: War in Abruzzo - Acknowledgements The bottle was given to the author, as he lived in AbruzzoCome la vedo io ... e grazie ‚Äì La Sveglia - Periodico Indipendente Ortonese ‚Äì ANNO XI - N. VIII - 2 Ottobre 1971 and his research work had taken him to that area. Halpenny said on donating the bottle: He also long campaigned for the Government to do their part and preserve a 1939-45 War airfield in its original condition; to let future generations see how the RAF operated during those dark days. He was a long-term supporter for animal welfare, especially dogs and wolves, and was the president of the Wolf Preservation Foundation.

The chain runs from northeast to southwest, with the Taita Hills being in Kenya and the other ranges being in Tanzania. They are delimited on the southwest by the fault complex represented by the Makambako Gap that separates them from the Kipengere Range. To the northeast, they are delimited by more recent volcanism represented by Mount Kilimanjaro. The chain is considered a Tentative World Heritage Site. Mountain ranges The Eastern Arc Mountains forms a roughly crescent-shaped arc and consists of: # Taita Hills # North and South Pare Mountains # East and West Usambara Mountains # Nguru Mountains # Ukaguru Mountains # Uluguru Mountains # Uvidunda Mountains # Rubeho Mountains # Malundwe Mountain # Udzungwa Mountains # Mahenge Mountains Geology These mountain ranges are the oldest in East Africa, and though physically separated from each other, share a similar geomorphology and ecology. They were formed at least one hundred million years ago along a fault lying to the east of the East African Rift, which is a more recent structure. About thirty million years ago, all this area was covered by extensive rainforest. During a period some ten million years ago, when the climate was cooler and drier, the lowland forests were converted to savanna, leaving the mountain ranges as \\"islands\\" where the tropical forests continued to flourish, fed by moisture-laden winds from the Indian Ocean. This isolation of each mountain range has led to a great deal of endemism, and a very diverse flora and fauna, The Eastern Arc becoming known as one of the world's top twenty biodiversity hotspots. Flora and fauna Seventy-five species of vertebrate are endemic to the Eastern Arc, as well as thousands of species of invertebrates. Fifteen plant genera are endemic to these mountains, as well as Streptocarpus sect. Saintpaulia, the African violet, now used as a houseplant around the world. Many of these endemics have evolved recently, but some are remnants of populations that were at one time more widespread. The Uluguru Mountains and the eastern Usambara Mountains have the greatest degree of biodiversity. Many endemic species are found on a single mountain range. Four of the endemic birds are similar to Asian species, and may have evolved at a time when the Arabian Peninsula had a coastal fringe of vegetation to act as a passageway; the Udzungwa forest partridge (Xenoperdix udzungwensis) is a relict and example of this, it is found only on the Rubeho Mountains and Udzungwa Mountains, and its closest relatives appear to be the hill partridges of Asia.

The institute began as an agricultural school formed by the Dutch colonial regime in the early 20th century. After independence it was part of the University of Indonesia before becoming an independent institute on September 1, 1963.History of IPB Embryonal Step (1941-1963)History of IPB Growth phase.

New schools for different fields were opened in the following years for Native Indonesians. The institute started in the early 20th century as a veterinary medicine and agricultural school. Before World War II, the institutions were known as Middelbare Landbouwschool (secondary agricultural school), Middelbare Bosbouwschool (secondary forestry school) dan Nederlandsch Indiche Veeartsenschool (veterinary school). H. J. Lovink's appointment as department director of agricultural education in 1910 marked a curriculum shift toward training for the government and private sides of colonial agribusiness, including basic biology classes augmented with practical education about cultivation techniques and technologies. Lovink argued that department officials in the Ministry of Agriculture \\"needed to familiarize themselves with Javanese farming practices.\\"239x239pxIn 1940, the Dutch government founded an Institution of Agricultural Higher Education in Bogor with the name Landbouw Hogeschool, which later on 31 October 1941 was called Landbouwkundige Faculteit (Agronomy Faculty). However, the school was closed down during the Japanese occupation (1942-1945). The Nederlandsch Indische Veeartsenschool remained in operation, but its name was changed to Bog≈çru j≈´igakk≈ç („Éú„Ç¥„Éº„É´Áç£ÂåªÂ≠¶Ê†°) (Bogor Veterinary School). Sometime after the declaration of independence in 1946, the Ministry of Social Welfare of the new Republic of Indonesia upgraded the Veterinary School in Bogor to the College of Veterinary Medicine (PTKH). The Netherlands returned to Indonesia and retook control of the institution in 1947, thus Landbouwkundige Faculteit was reopened as the Faculteit Voor Landbouw-Wetenschappen, which had majors in Agriculture and Forestry. In 1948 the PTKH or College of Veterinary Medicine was changed to Faculteit voor Diergeneeskunde under Universiteit van Indonesi√´ (later the University of Indonesia). After Indonesia gained its independence in 1950, Landbouw- wetenschappen became the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Indonesia, with three departments ‚Äî Socio-Economics, Physical Sciences, and Forestry. In 1957 the Department of Land Fishery was formed. Meanwhile, Faculteit voor Dieergeneeskunde became the Faculty of Veterinary Medicines and Animal Husbandry. IPB was founded on September 1, 1963 by the decision of the Minister of Science and Higher Education No. 92/1963 and was approved by President Sukarno's decree No. 279/1965. At the time, the two faculties of University of Indonesia which is in Bogor were separated into an independent institution. The new university (IPB) has five faculties: Agriculture, Veterinary Medicine, Fisheries, Animal Science, and Forestry. In 1964 the Faculty of Technology and Mechanization of Agriculture was added. =Recent events= On December 26, 2000 the Indonesia government changed IPB's autonomy status to a state-owned university.

The roots of FEMA IPB were the former Department of Community Nutrition and Family Resource (GMSK) of Faculty of Agriculture; Study Program of Agriculture Extension and Communication of Socioeconomy Department, Faculty of Agriculture; and socioeconomic study programs of all the other faculties in IPB. The Department of Community Nutrition and Family Resource (GMSK) of Faculty of Agriculture was developed into Department of Community Nutrition (GIZ) and Department of Family and Consumer Sciences (IKK). While the Department of Agricultural Socioeconomy (SOSEK) of Faculty of Agriculture was transformed into Department of Communication and Community Development (KPM), Department of Agribusiness, and Department of Environmental Resource Economy (ESL). Furthermore; through the clustering process; the Department of Community Nutrition (GIZ), the Department of Family and Consumer Sciences (IKK), and the Department of Communication and Community Development (KPM) merged up to become the Faculty of Human Ecology (FEMA). FEMA IPB is the first and only faculty of its kind in Indonesia and it is one of the three faculties of human ecology throughout South East Asia. The others are in the College of Human Ecology University of Philippines at Los Banos (UPLB) and the Faculty of Human Ecology, Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). * The university conducts higher education on human ecology focusing on nutritional sciences, family and consumer sciences, and communication & community development sciences. * It runs researches and advances the development of science and technology in human ecology for social transformation.

Viz Media. 10. known mononymously as L, is a fictional character in the manga series Death Note, created by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata. He is an enigmatic, mysterious and highly-esteemed international consulting detective, who communicates with law enforcement agencies only through his equally inexplicable handler/assistant, Watari, who serves as his official liaison with the authorities and whose true identity and background is kept a secret. Though his past is shrouded in mystery, he has gained an arguable reputation as the world's greatest detective/criminal profiler. Throughout the series, he observes and spies on the activities of the series' protagonist, Light Yagami, a high school genius. L attempts to expose Light as the infamous serial killer \\"Kira\\", who is responsible for massacring high-profile criminals worldwide through apparently supernatural means. As the series progresses, the psychological mind-game of cat and mouse between L and Light intensifies, and each becomes bent on uncovering the other's true identity, through a series of intricate ploys and schemes, before their cover is blown. Throughout the series, he serves as an ideological and visual foil to Light. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by Kappei Yamaguchi in Japanese, and by Alessandro Juliani in English. He is portrayed by Kenichi Matsuyama in the live-action film series, by Kento Yamazaki in the TV drama, and by Lakeith Stanfield in the American film. Creation and conception Tsugumi Ohba, the writer of the series, created L as a young adult, since he believed the story would not hold much interest if L were significantly older than his opponent, Light. For L's name, he wanted to use a single letter with a lot of significance; he considered \\"I\\" and \\"J\\", but eventually he chose \\"L\\" after careful consideration. Ohba left most of L's character design to Takeshi Obata, artist of the series. Obata asked Ohba if L could be \\"unattractive\\". Afterwards Ohba included ideas in his thumbnails, including L's manner of sitting, \\"he's English\\", and \\"he's listless\\". Ohba added details regarding L's mannerisms and his interests in sweets. Ohba credits Obata for the character designs. Obata commented that L's thumbnails by Ohba had no bags under his eyes, and that he had a \\"plain face with no expression\\" which was very useful. Obata drew L as an \\"attractive young man\\" until chapter 11, when the character appeared in person. After chapter 11, Obata and Ohba agreed to contrast his appearance with Light's. During the development of the early manga chapters, Obata feared L would appear \\"so suspicious that Light would know instantly it was L if they ever met\\". When Obata's editor told him that he wanted L to have a face \\"looking cool based on the angle\\", Obata added black bags under L's eyes. Obata cited Devilman's Akira Fudou when stating that he believed that black bags were appealing. In addition, Obata thought of a \\"dead eyes\\" concept, which involved L having \\"all-black eyes\\" and \\"mostly no eyebrows\\". Obata believes that black eyes usually makes a character goofier, but the bags \\"sharpen the character's gaze\\". Obata believes that the design evokes \\"a feeling of mystery\\" and that the reader cannot determine L's true thoughts. Obata also said that the bags under L's eyes were useful for inspiring speculation about his lifestyle and background. The outfit Obata designed for L was a \\"simple\\" white, long-sleeved shirt and jeans, to convey that L does not put thought into choosing his clothing. In Death Note 13: How to Read, Ohba presented an initial rough draft of L and said that, with a \\"cool expression\\" and without the bags under his eyes, L looked like a different person. Obata stated that the peculiar traits exhibited by L are best revealed \\"gradually\\". Obata added that if he drew L eating \\"mountains of sweets\\" before revealing his face, he would not have \\"much credibility as a super detective\\" and people would ask if he was \\"crazy\\". Both Ohba and Obata chose L as their favorite character from the series, and most of our favorites with the former noting him as the \\"strongest\\" character in the series besides Light, and the latter due to \\"appearance, personality, everything\\". Obata said that he could never have created a character like L and that he enjoyed drawing him. Obata added that because of this, L was not \\"real\\" to him and that he liked that aspect of the character. L's fighting style has been described as similar to capoeira. However, Obata has denied considering this when drawing L's fights, saying that he was thinking of the most effective way to kick someone whilst handcuffed. He added that if the style resembles capoeira, then this \\"adds another element to it\\" and \\"that makes me happy\\".

Sunday March 23, 2008. Retrieved on January 25, 2010. Appearances =In Death Note= capital blackletter \\"L\\" to represent himself. L, who also uses the aliases , , , and , the latter two for which he has developed reputations as the second- and third-best detectives in the world, is a very discreet and secretive individual and only communicates with the authorities through his assistant/representative Watari. He never shows his face to the world, instead representing himself with a capital L in Cloister Black font. His real name, L Lawliet, is only revealed in the guidebook Death Note 13: How to Read. Whilst presented as an enigmatic, nameless, highly-intelligent, cunning and globally-esteemed international consulting detective, L is revealed to actually be a tall, disheleved and gaunt youth in his 20s with a pale complexion and visible dark circles around his eyes. He is a socially-inept, awkward and somewhat misanthropic recluse. He has many notable quirks and eccentricities, such as holding things with his index and thumb fingers, crouching instead of sitting, mostly walking around barefoot, and having an unnatural affinity for sweets, cakes, candies, dairy foods and confectionery foods. He is seen exclusively eating these foods but this diet has no apparent effect on his health and physiology. Even with these eccentricities, he is a highly-skilled, intellectually-astute and brilliant criminologist/crime investigator. He may come off as cold and cynical and often utilizes questionable methods and mostly takes up solving cases out of boredom rather than a sense of duty. However, he does have a strict moral code, is aware of his own flaws and shortcomings and is unwilling to cross morally repugnant standards, unlike Kira. L has spent most of his life dedicating himself to solving crime cases, and hunting down and apprehending notorious criminals and felons around the world. He is implied to suffer from loneliness, internal torment and a low esteem, even calling himself \\"a monster\\", at one point. He also possesses an unusually high intellect and uncanny skills in strategisation, deduction, observation, reasoning and profiling, which have given him a high reputation amongst law enforcement agencies around the globe. At the start of the series, L carries out his own investigation of a series of mysterious serial-killings across the globe, all of which are carried out by an apparent supernatural serial-killer known as \\"Kira\\", which is the Japanese trans-literation of the English word \\"killer\\". After deducing that the serial-killings are all connected and perpetrated by a single mastermind and are sourced from Japan, L allies himself with the Japanese police force and assists them in investigating the murders. Although he strongly suspects the series' protagonist, Light Yagami, a high school genius and the son of detective superintendent Soichiro Yagami, one of the primary members of the Kira investigation allied with L, to be Kira's alter- ego, he is unable to prove his theory, due to lack of evidence, but nonetheless remains suspicious of Light and carefully observes him. The majority of the series' initial focus is on L and Light's complex, cerebral and intricate psychological mind-game of cat and mouse, as both utilise their wits and intellect, in an attempt to outdo the other and expose them. Though L comes very close to exposing Light as Kira, he is eventually killed by Light himself before he can do so, but before his death, he finally acknowledges his suspicion that Light is Kira came to be true. Although L's death regressed the Kira investigation's progress, he had prepared himself with a contingency plan to ensure that someone would continue L's work in hunting down and apprehending Kira, by selecting two gifted child orphans to be his potential successors, one of whom eventually succeeds in exposing Light as Kira. Although his true identity and birth name is obscured in mystery throughout the series, L utilises a number of aliases to maintain his anonymity, such as \\"Hideki Ryuga\\" or \\"Ryuzaki\\", the latter of which he uses as his primary pseudonym throughout the Kira investigation. Ohba said that L is the most intelligent character in the entire Death Note series because \\"the plot requires it\\". He added that he personally views L as \\"slightly evil\\". =In film= L is portrayed by Kenichi Matsuyama in the live-action films that adapt the Death Note manga, with his portrayal and characterization of the character receiving wide praise for being earnestly faithful to his original manga counterpart. Unlike the manga, in the second film, his \\"death\\", caused by Rem writing his name in her Death Note, does not take effect, as L had written his own name in Misa's Death Note earlier. In the 2008 movie L: Change the World, which takes place in the 23 days that L has left before he dies, L decides to solve one last case. He tries to stop a bio-terrorist organization led by \\"K\\" from spreading a deadly virus around the world, along the way he meets a girl named Maki, FBI agent Suruga and a boy who he names Near. In Death Note: Light Up the New World, Kenichi Matsuyama reprises his role as L. He makes a cameo appearance with child Ryuzaki, who inherits his DNA, giving him a lollipop and telling him to not use the Death Note as Ryuzaki promises not to. He is also seen in a CG video that Ryuzaki created. Lakeith Stanfield portrays L in the live-action American film adaptation. In this adaptation, he is shown as an enigmatic, skillful and highly esteemed international consulting detective. He is calm and calculating, yet socially inept and eccentric. He only communicates with the authorities through his handler/assistant, \\"Watari\\", and is affiliated with a number of law enforcement agencies, such as the FBI, CIA and Interpol. He has earned a reputation for solving numerous cold cases and takes up the task of apprehending the world-famous serial killer known as \\"Kira\\", who is responsible for massacring numerous high-profile criminals around the world through apparently supernatural means. This version of the character retains much of his manga counterpart's traits and characteristics, such as his preference to crouch rather than sit, his fondness for sweets, his socially- awkward, quirky and eccentric personality, and his tendency to hold things with his index fingers and thumbs. His past also originates from a secluded orphanage, though his real name is given as \\"Lebensborn Atubia\\". After deducing Kira's location in Seattle by purposely seeding the names of obscure criminals to \\"Kira\\", he assists police detective James Turner, the local head of the \\"Kira\\" investigation in Seattle. As the investigation progresses, L deduces that \\"Kira\\" needs a name and face to kill his victims and eventually suspects Light Turner, James' teenaged son, is connected to the murders. L obsessively tries to expose him and assigns a group of FBI agents to shadow him, along with other potential \\"Kira\\" suspects. As the film progresses, he demonstrates a darker, more aggressive, unstable and morally ambiguous side of his personality, which is intensified by the eventual deaths of the FBI agents (which is attributed to Kira) and Watari's sudden disappearance. L becomes emotionally unstable and attempts to attack Light in his home when he refuses to confess that he is \\"Kira\\". L begins his own manhunt for Light when Watari is seemingly murdered by \\"Kira\\", and James issues an arrest warrant for L, whom he sees as increasingly unstable. Light hoodwinks the authorities by manipulating a number of criminals to continue carrying out his activities through the Death Note, while inducing himself into a medical coma. This seemingly proves Light's innocence, and L is taken off the case. After deducing Light's girlfriend Mia Sutton's connection with the serial-murders, L finds a hidden page of the Death Note within her home and contemplates writing Light's name in it. Elsewhere, Light is visited by Ryuk, the Death Note's original owner, who comments on how interesting he finds humans. L's background and past is briefly explored in this adaptation. His childhood originates from a secluded and currently abandoned orphanage named the St. Martin's Orphanage. There, he was subjected to a series of tests and experiments as part of a clandestine government project to raise intellectually-gifted orphans into skilled black ops agents. As a result, his mental psyche was severely affected, which explains his unusual quirks and his unstable, irrational behavior in the film's second half. After his training and the institute's subsequent shutdown, L gained a reputation as an expert international detective with the help of Watari, who kept his mental stability in check and acted as a handler. =In other media= In the light novel Another Note: The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases, L recruits FBI agent Naomi Misora to investigate a series of murders. While the story includes several phone discussions with him from Misora's perspective, he only appears in person at the end of the novel, when he goes by the name \\"Ryuzaki\\" - an alias he appropriates from the novel's serial murderer, Beyond Birthday, who masquerades as L under the alias \\"Rue Ryuzaki\\". The light novel also says that L won the aliases Eraldo Coil and Deneuve in a \\"detective war\\" with the real Coil and Deneuve. In the musical adaptation, L is portrayed by Teppei Koike in the Japanese version and Kim Junsu in the Korean version. In the demo recording, he was portrayed by Jarrod Spector In the live-action TV drama, L is portrayed by Kento Yamazaki. The miniseries version has a few differences with other versions. His main outfit in the ministeries is a white shirt and white trousers. While capturing Higuchi, Light saves L's life from Higuchi's gunshot. Later, while L tells Light that Light had written L's name in a false Death Note and that L will tell others that Light is Kira, Mikami kills L. Then Near takes L's place and follows the videos left by L. L's funeral is shown at the end of the series. Reception Alessandro Juliani's work as L's English voice actor has received praise. Publications from manga and anime have commended L's character. Tom S. Pepirium of IGN describes L as \\"the coolest, most well developed character in anime today\\". Pepirium said that the \\"excellent translation\\" is responsible for L being a \\"success\\" in the English- language dub of Death Note. Anime News Network's Theron Martin found that the mental duels between L and Light are appealing to viewers of the series due to how each attempts to discover the identity of the other while at the same time wanting to hide their own. The Hyper staff and Mania Entertainment's Julie Rosato agreed with Martin, with the latter commenting that L's and Light's rivalry as one of the best parts from the series to the point of being something \\"unique\\" in a manga. Although PopCultureShock writer Carlos Alexandre also praised their rivalry, he still found L to be \\"too smart\\" noting that \\"some careful listening and application of critical thinking will make apparent the holes in L‚Äôs supposedly superhuman logic, holes that simply, given L‚Äôs character, should not be there\\". While reviewing the manga's third volume, Rosato concludes the article by saying that L \\"wins this volume; he really drove it forward\\" due to how close he gets to Light in such little time, which makes Light lose his temper after meeting him despite how calm he normally is. Pepirium adds that Alessandro Juliani, L's voice actor, portrays his slurping and gulping sweets as \\"somehow non-irritating\\". Theron Martin has also repeatedly praised Juliani's work, noting that he \\"captures the eccentric brilliance of L\\". IGN ranked him as the 12th greatest anime character of all time, saying that \\"Every good lead character needs a challenge, and L provided the opposition that the Death Note series required to captivate fans.\\" In January 2007, Oricon made a poll in which they asked Japanese fans from manga and anime which characters from any series they would most like to see in spinoff series. The overall winner from the poll was L, who also ranked first in the women's poll and second in the men's poll. In the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Awards (SPJA) from 2008 Alessandro Juliani was the winner in the category \\"Best Voice Actor (English)\\" for his work as L. Kappei Yamaguchi was the winner in the category \\"Best Voice Actor (Japanese)\\" from the 2009 SPJA Industry Awards for his work as L. L also won in the category \\"Best Male Character\\". In the NEO Awards 2007 from Neo, L won in the category \\"Best Manga Character\\".

It was released on July 18, 2000, via X-Ray Records. The twelve-track record featured guest appearances by Cypress Hill and Profound. Overview Mellow Man Ace scored a major crossover hit with 1989's \\"Mentirosa\\" but, by 1993, the Havana-born rapper was without a record deal. Released in 2000, From the Darkness Into the Light was his first album since 1992's The Brother With Two Tongues. Eight years is a long time for an MC to go without a new album‚Äîespecially when you consider how much hip-hop trends can change from one year to the next. But Ace, who was 33 when this CD came out, has no problem changing with the times and delivering an excellent album that is mindful of 2000's rap tastes. A revitalized Ace divides the disc into a Dark Side and a Light Side, which might lead one to assume that he is dividing his time between hardcore rap and pop-rap like he did in the past. But that isn't the case. Enlisting such producers as DJ Muggs (of Cypress Hill and 7A3 fame) and Tony G., Ace avoids pop-rap‚Äîthis release doesn't offer anything as commercial as \\"Mentirosa\\"‚Äîand sticks to hardcore rap. Truth be told, the Dark Side and Light Side are equally hard-hitting. The album has a consistently serious tone; Ace tackles a lot of social issues (everything from urban violence to child pornography), and he speaks candidly and openly about the fact that he went from fame to obscurity. Regrettably, From the Darkness Into the Light wasn't the major commercial comeback he was no doubt hoping for‚Äîthe album received very little attention. But that doesn't make it any less compelling.

The game achieved mixed reviews. Shadow Madness was packaged with a separate demo disc for Jade Cocoon. Gameplay The player's party consists of three members, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. In battle, the player has a choice of using physical attacks, magic, items and escape. It plays the same on the field in terms of using inventory, moving about and talking to non-player characters. Battles in Shadow Madness are random, but one unique aspect of this system lets players avoid some battles. When exploring, the growl of a monster is heard. Pressing L2 and R2 simultaneously will make Stinger \\"hide\\" on the ground and doing this allows the player to possibly avoid a battle altogether. Shadow Madness uses some elements of Square's Active-Time Battle system. In particular, enemies will not wait to attack. The maximum level of experience a character can reach is 15. Characters can unleash powerful \\"summons\\" during battle. Shadow Madness features 3D polygonal models on 2D pre-rendered backgrounds, with the battle scenes taking place in a fully 3D environment. The game includes CG cutscenes to further the storyline. Plot =Story= The storyline is centered on saving the world from a mysterious plague that is spreading quickly. The player takes the role as Stinger, whose town has just been destroyed. The player meets many friends and foes on their way to finding out how the chaos started and how it can be stopped. =Characters= * Stinger -- When the chaos wipes out his hometown, he vows to end the chaos. * Windleaf -- Joins Stinger after her secluded sylvan village gets attacked. * Harv-5 -- A robot originally created for harvesting crops, but when the demons destroy his fields and home he sets out to find out his purpose. His catchphrase of sorts is \\"There will be death.\\" * Xero Von Moon -- A Mage Warrior who has been resurrected from his deep sleep, he has no body so he floats around with just his head. * Clemett -- He is a native Gadgeteer, but he didn't agree with how they lived so he went to live with humans, and when the chaos started he vowed to protect his 'Friends'. * Jirina -- She is a proud Org-Ta and a native of the underground world known as Wyldern. Her people have been enslaved by the Darg who turned a once peaceful land into a twisted hell. She vows to get revenge. Development Shadow Madness development team Big Rain included Ted Woolsey, who helped script the story. Paul Reed, who wrote the game's story, previously worked on the Super Nintendo action role-playing game Secret of Evermore before making Shadow Madness. He later worked on Metroid Prime for the GameCube. Most of Shadow Madness' development staff were new to the industry, learning as they went along while designing the game. Prior to its release, publisher ASCII Entertainment dropped the game, possibly due to the company's lack of funds. Shadow Madness was later picked up by Crave Entertainment. Woolsey looked to Final Fantasy VII as proof that players were interested in mature role-playing games with realistic graphics.http://www.rpgamer.com/games/other/psx/smad/text/info/twint.html A version for the Game.com was in development, but was ultimately cancelled. =Music= Much of the music throughout Shadow Madness is deliberately dark, ambient and mood-setting. Unlike most other turn-based role-playing games, Shadow Madness has multiple battle themes, most of which are orchestral in nature. Reception Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Shadow Madness comes nowhere near breaking any new ground to prove the bias [in judging RPGs only against what has come before] unworthy. Ultimately, Crave's game emulates the genre well, but does little to enhance it.\\" Shadow Madness received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator GameRankings. Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine gave the game the award for worst character design in its 1999 Editors' Awards. GameSpot summed it up by saying, \\"Whoever said 'Graphics don't matter' never played Shadow Madness.\\" X-Play placed it at number 3 on their top 5 worst role-playing games video.

In both series, the part of Arthur Lane was played by Fine Time Fontayne. Cast * Nicholas Lane (series one) and Shaun Dooley (series two) as Johnny Street * Fine Time Fontayne as Arthur Lane Plot The main characters, Johnny Street and Arthur Lane play partners in a small Yorkshire building firm. The series records their rather odd experiences in Yorkshire suburbia, doing a variety of small and large jobs for householders. Street and Lane often wax philosophical to each other about life, the Universe, and everything. Lane worked for Street's father in the firm, which apparently suffered from certain financial irregularities. Street gave up a teaching career to rescue the family business. The humour is understated, lurking under a stereotypically laconic Yorkshire mindset. Various running jokes are used. \\"Head Office calling!\\" means Mrs. Street, who fields customer calls at home, is calling Johnny on his mobile phone. The \\"lady with the boiler on Misperton Avenue\\" is a fictional customer used as an all-purpose excuse for not being able to take on a job right away (the builders do not want to seem desperate for business) or for making a quick exit from an embarrassing situation.

It consists of a series of poetic monologues to be accompanied by dance movements and music, a form Shange coined as the choreopoem.Carr, Jane (October 28, 2018), \\"What 'For Colored Girls' meant to us\\", CNN. for colored girls... tells the stories of seven women who have suffered oppression in a racist and sexist society. As a choreopoem, the piece is a series of 20 separate poems choreographed to music that weaves interconnected stories of love, empowerment, struggle and loss into a complex representation of sisterhood. The cast consists of seven nameless African-American women only identified by the colors they are assigned. They are the lady in red, lady in orange, lady in yellow, lady in green, lady in blue, lady in brown, and lady in purple. Subjects from rape, abandonment, abortion and domestic violence are tackled. Shange originally wrote the monologues as separate poems in 1974. Her writing style is idiosyncratic and she often uses vernacular language, unique structure, and unorthodox punctuation to emphasize syncopation. Shange wanted to write for colored girls... in a way that mimicked how real women speak so she could draw her readers' focus to the experience of reading and listening. In December 1974, Shange performed the first incarnation of her choreopoem with four other artists at a women's bar outside Berkeley, California. After moving to New York City, she continued work on for colored girls..., which went on to open at the Booth Theatre in 1976, becoming the second play by a black woman to reach Broadway, preceded by Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun in 1959. Shange updated the original choreopoem in 2010, by adding the poem \\"positive\\" and referencing the Iraq War and PTSD. for colored girls... has been performed Off-Broadway as well as on Broadway, and was adapted as a book (first published in 1976 by Shameless Hussy Press), a 1982 television film, and a 2010 theatrical film. The 1976 Broadway production was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play. Title for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf is a piece of work inspired by events of Shange's own life. Shange admitted publicly to having attempted suicide on four occasions. In a phone interview conducted with CNN, she explained how she came to the title of her choreopoem: \\"I was driving the No. 1 Highway in northern California and I was overcome by the appearance of two parallel rainbows. I had a feeling of near death or near catastrophe. Then I drove through the rainbow and I went away. Then I put that together to form the title.\\" The colors of the rainbow then became the essence of the women in the choreopoem. Shange also explains that she chose to use the word \\"colored\\" in the title of her choreopoem so that her grandmother would be able to understand it.

The poems are choreographed to music that weaves together interconnected stories. The choreopoem is performed by a cast of seven nameless women only identified by the colors they are assigned. They are the lady in red, lady in orange, lady in yellow, lady in green, lady in blue, lady in brown, and lady in purple. Subjects from rape, abandonment, abortion, and domestic violence are tackled. By the end of the play these women come together in a circle, symbolizing the unity they have found sharing their stories. *\\"dark phrases\\" ‚Äì Lady in Brown with Ladies in Red, Blue, Orange, Green, Yellow and Purple The prologue of the choreopoem \\"dark phrases\\" begins with the lady in brown describing the \\"dark phrases of womanhood\\".Shange, p. 17. All she hears are screams and promises. Each woman states where she is from, by stating they are outside their respective cities. The lady in brown proclaims that this piece is all for \\"colored girls who have considered suicide / but moved to the ends of their own rainbows\\".Shange, p. 20. The women then begin to sing children's nursery rhymes, \\"mama's little baby likes shortnin, shortnin\\". Then all the ladies start to dance to the song \\"Dancing in the Streets\\". *\\"graduation nite\\" ‚Äì Lady in Yellow with Ladies in Blue, Green and Red The lady in yellow says it was graduation night and she was the only virgin. She was out driving around with her male friends who she has known since the seventh grade in a black Buick, laughing about graduation. After a fight breaks out, the lady in yellow and Bobby leave and end up having sex in the back of the Buick. The other ladies start talking about their sexual preferences. *\\"now i love somebody more than\\" ‚Äì Lady in Blue with Ladies in Yellow, Blue, and Green The lady in blue talks about how she used to participate in dance marathons frequently. One night she refused to dance with anyone that only spoke English. Throughout the monologue she intertwines English and Spanish. During this time she discovered blues clubs. She says she became possessed by the music. She ends her monologue by calling it her poem \\"thank-you for music,\\" to which she states: \\"I love you more than poem\\".Shange, p. 27. She repeats \\"te amo mas que,\\" and the other women join her, softly chanting. *\\"no assistance\\" ‚Äì Lady in Red The lady in red addresses an ambiguous \\"you\\" throughout the monologue. She has loved this \\"you\\" strongly and passionately \\"for 8 months, 2 wks, & a day\\" without any encouragement. She decides to end this affair and leaves a note attached to a plant that she has watered every day since she met this person. *\\"i'm a poet who\\" ‚Äì Lady in Orange with Ladies in Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple and Brown The lady in orange begins by saying she does not want to write in neither English nor Spanish, but she only wants to dance. She forgets all about words when she starts to dance. She says \\"we gotta dance to keep form cryin and dyin\\" and the other ladies repeat her words.Shange, p. 29. The lady in orange then claims that she is a poet \\"who writes in english / come to share the worlds witchu\\".Shange, p. 30. *\\"latent rapists'\\" ‚Äì Ladies in Red, Blue, Purple The lady in blue talks about how hard it is to press charges against a friend. The other women begin to ponder and ask questions. They say that maybe it was a misunderstanding, or the woman caused it, and they ask her if she was drinking. The lady in red states that society only believes someone is a rapist if they are a perverted stranger. The women talk about male friends of theirs who have nice smiles and buy them dinner but end up raping women. The women all share the experience of having been violated by a man they knew while being on the lookout for ‚Äúthe stranger we always thot it wd be‚ÄùShange, p. 34. The lady in red states that the \\"nature of rape has changed.\\" The lights change, the women react to an imaginary slap. *\\"abortion cycle #1\\" ‚Äì Lady in Blue The lady in blue sets the scene with tubes, tables, white washed windows, and her legs spread open. She couldn't bear to have people looking at her while she got an abortion so she is all alone. *\\"sechita\\" ‚Äì Lady in Purple with Lady in Green The lady in purple describes Sechita's life in the bayou, while lady in green dances out Sechita's life. She is dressed up for the Creole carnival celebration. She embodies the spirit of her namesake, Sechita, the Egyptian goddess of creativity, love, beauty and filth from the 2nd millennium. *\\"toussaint\\" ‚Äì Lady in Brown The lady in brown describes falling in love with Toussaint L'Ouverture finding Toussaint in the library near the train tracks. The lady in brown talks about entering a contest to see which \\"colored child\\" could read 15 books in three weeks and the lady in brown won, but she was disqualified because she went into the adult reading room and read about Toussaint instead of reading the children's books. The lady in brown became obsessed with Toussaint despite the fact that he was dead. He was her \\"secret lover at age 8\\".Shange, p. 41. The lady in brown wanted to run away to go to Haiti with Toussaint. On her journey the lady in brown meets a young boy whose name is Toussaint Jones. The lady in brown feels likes she's met her real-life Toussaint and she leaves with him. *\\"one\\" ‚Äì Lady in Red The lady in red enters begins by describing a beautiful woman wearing orange butterflies, silk roses, and aqua sequins. This woman is deliberate in all her actions. Although she walked slowly to allow men to gaze at her, she never returned their interest with a smile or acknowledging their catcalls. She was \\"hot / a deliberate coquette\\".Shange, p. 46. Her goal was to be unforgettable. She takes \\"those especially schemin/ tactful suitors\\" to go home with her. In the morning, she becomes her ordinary self by washing off the glitter and the grime from the night before. She asks her lovers to leave. The men would leave in a hurry, and then she cleaned up and put her roses away. She would write about her exploits in her diary and then, cry herself to sleep. *\\"i usedta to live in the world\\" ‚Äì Lady in Blue The lady in blue begins her monologue by explaining that she used to live in the world but now only lives in Harlem, and her universe is only six blocks. She used to walk all over the world and now her world is small and dirty. The lady in blue says that when she used to live in the world where she was nice and sweet but now, now she cannot bring herself to be nice to anyone in this \\"six blocks of cruelty / piled up on itself\\".Shange, p. 53. *\\"pyramid\\" ‚Äì Lady in Purple The lady in purple joins the ladies in blue, yellow, and orange. She starts by describing them as three friends who shared every aspect of their lives. They remember a time when they all were attracted to the same man, but he only could choose one of them. The one who he chose loved him, but worried if her friends could hold out. One day she found the rose she left on his pillow on her friend's desk. The friend said she did not know what was going on, because the man said he was free. The three friends did not want to hurt one another but they know how wonderful this man could be. The friends hug and cry and go to confront the man, whom they find with another woman. The women cry and comfort each other like sisters. *\\"no more love poems #1\\" ‚Äì Lady in Orange The lady in orange discusses a relationship that left her heartbroken. She says that ever since she realized that someone would call a \\"colored girl an evil woman a bitch or a nag\\" (56) she has tried not to be that person. She tries and not only give joy, but receive it as well. She finds herself in what she believes to be a real and honest relationship. Yet, the guy keeps going back to his ex-lover. The lady in orange tried to move on by finding another lover, but she wasn't satisfied. She tried to avoid sadness, but she found herself heartbroken by this man. She could not stand being \\"sorry & colored at the same time / it‚Äôs so redundant in the modern world\\".Shange, p. 57. *\\"no more love poems #2\\" ‚Äì Lady in Purple The lady in purple speaks about her relationship to dance and men. She deliberately chooses to dance with men who don't speak English, pops pills, and uses dance as an escape from reality. Then she meets a man who she gave everything: dance, fear, hope and scars. She admits she was ready to die, but now is ready to be herself and accept love. She pleads, \\"lemme love you just like i am / a colored girl/ i'm finally bein real\\".Shange, p. 58. *\\"no more love poems #3\\" ‚Äì Lady in Blue The lady in blue proclaims that they all deal with too much emotion and that it might be easier to be white. That way they could make everything \\"dry & abstract wit no rhythm & no / reelin for sheer sensual pleasure\\". The lady in blue states that they should try to control their feelings and she is going to take the first step by masturbating. However, she finds that this makes her feel lonely and doesn't know where to look to feel whole. *\\"no more love poems #4\\" ‚Äì Lady in Yellow The lady in yellow claims to have lost touch with reality because she used to think she was immune to emotional pain, but she realized she is not. She gave her dance, but her dance was not enough. She says \\"bein alive & bein a woman & bein colored is a metaphysical / dilemma / i haven't conquered yet\\".Shange, p. 59. *\\"my love is too\\" ‚Äì Ladies in Yellow, Brown, Purple, Blue, Orange, Red, Green The other women come each repeat, \\"my love is too...delicate/beautiful/sanctified/magic/saturday nite/complicated/music to have thrown back in my face.\\"Shange, p. 60. The ladies begin dancing and chanting together. *\\"somebody almost walked off wid alla my stuff\\" ‚Äì Lady in Green The lady in green says that someone has taken all of her \\"stuff\\". She feels that she is the only one that knows and can appreciate the value of her stuff. She describes her stuff as the way she sits with her legs open sometimes, her chewed up fingernails, her rhythm, her voice, her talk, her \\"delicate leg and whimsical kiss\\".Shange, p. 64. The person who stole her stuff is a man. She made too much room for this man who has run off with her stuff, especially because he doesn't even know that he has it. By the end of the monologue she demands her stuff back from this man. *\\"sorry\\" ‚Äì Ladies in Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple The ladies start talking about all the apologies they've received from men. Some examples include: he is sorry because he does not know how she got your number, sorry because he was high, sorry because he is only human, and sorry because he thought she could handle it. The lady in blue then declares that she does not need any more apologies. She goes on to say that men should keep their apologies for themselves, because she does not need them to soothe her soul and she cannot use them. Rather than accepting apologies, she is going to do whatever she wants: yell, scream, and break things. And she will not apologize for any of it. *\\"positive\\" ‚Äì Ladies in Red, Yellow, Purple, Brown Lady in yellow, purple, brown, red participate in reciting the next poem about contracting HIV/AIDS; they share the lines and all speak to one woman's experience. The ladies argue about suspicions of cheating in the relationship. The lady in yellow tells her friends how happy she is in her relationship and her friend tells her, they've seen her lover outside the gay bars. The lady in yellow protests, but her friend tells her to get tested. The lady in yellow goes to get tested to put the whole issue to bed. Two weeks later, the doctor calls the lady in yellow with her patient number (#7QYG9) to inform her that she is HIV positive. The lady in yellow confronts her lover who furiously tells her he is not gay and accuses her of cheating on him. She tells him to get tested but he gets angrier and violent. He throws her to the ground and when she wakes up he is gone and she says, \\"& i was positive / & not positive at all\\".Shange, p. 78. *\\"a nite with beau willie brown\\" ‚Äì Lady in Red, Orange The lady in orange begins the story of Willie Brown by saying there is no air. Beau Willie is all tied up in the sheets, wishing a friend would come over and bring him some blow or any other kind of drug. The lady in red continues the story, saying that Beau Willie claims there is nothing wrong with him. Beau Willie tried to get veterans' benefits but he cannot read, so he starts driving a cab around the city but the cops always give him a hard time and he is not making any money. The lady in orange and red say that Crystal is pregnant again and Beau beats Crystal almost to death when he hears about her pregnancy. Beau Willie has wanted to marry Crystal since she was 14 but now, she laughs in his face saying she will never marry him. She has the baby and there are now two kids, Naomi and Kwame. Crystal ends up getting a court order to keep Beau away from her and the children. Beau Willie comes to the house despite the court order and while he is there he becomes apologetic saying he just wants to marry her and give her things. The two children run to their father as Crystal watches. Suddenly, he grabs the kids and pushes the screen out of the window. Beau Willie tells Crystal she has to agree to marry him. Naomi and Kwame scream and Crystal, at the moment, can only whisper. Beau Willie drops the kids out of the window and they die. *\\"a laying on of hands\\" ‚Äì Ladies in Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Brown The ladies begin the last poem saying that they are missing something: a \\"layin on of hands\\".Shange, p. 84. The hands are strong, cool, moving, and make them whole and pure. The lady in blue says she feels the gods coming into her, laying her open to herself. She goes on to say that she knows about laying her body open for a man, but still she was missing something. Finally, all the ladies repeat the lines she says, \\"i found god in myself / & i loved her / I loved her fiercely\\".Shange, p. 87. They sing to each other and then the audience, and close into a tight circle with each other. The choreopoem ends with lady in brown modifying her earlier statement: \\"& this is for colored girls who have considered suicide/ but are movin to the ends of their own rainbows.\\" Production history Ntozake Shange, author of for colored girls for colored girls... was first performed by Shange with four other artists at the Bacchanal, a women's bar, outside Berkeley, California.Haring-Smith, Tori, \\"For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf\\", in Don B. Wilmeth with Tice L. Miller (eds), The Cambridge Guide to American Theatre, Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 157. About six months after performing the work in California, Shange and her collaborator, Paula Moss, decided to move across the country determined to perform it in New York City's downtown alternative spaces. At the age of 27, Shange moved to New York, where, in July 1975, the reworked for colored girls was professionally produced in New York City at Studio Rivbea in 1975. East coast audiences were soon able to experience Shange‚Äôs performance piece at other venues including the Old Reliable, and DeMonte's beginning in July 1975 and then starting in March 1976 at the Henry Street Settlement‚Äôs New Federal Theatre. The show grew increasingly popular, especially among African-American and Latino audiences. As a result, for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf opened at The Public Theater in June 1976. Three months later, in September, the show was performed at the Booth Theater on Broadway, where it was continued until July 1978 and ran for 742 shows.Shange, Ntozake. for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf. Scribner, 2010. p. 1. Shange performed as the \\"lady in orange\\" at the Broadway opening. It was also published in book form in 1977 by Macmillan Publishing, followed by a Literary Guild edition in October 1977 and Bantam Books editions beginning in 1980. In 1982 for colored girls... was adapted for television on WNET-TV, PBS, as part of The American Playhouse series. Although for colored girls went from a play production to television one, this production was dubbed a \\"telefilm\\" instead of a teleplay as the performance on WNET-TV was seen as a serious departure from the Broadway production. In 2009 Tyler Perry announced that he would produce Shange's for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf. The film was the first project for 34th Street Films, Perry's new production company housed in Lionsgate The cast included Loretta Devine, Kimberly Elise, Whoopi Goldberg, Janet Jackson, Phylicia RashƒÅd, Anika Noni Rose, Kerry Washington and Thandie Newton. Originally using the play's full title, the film's title was shortened to For Colored Girls in September 2010. In the fall of 2019, The Public Theater revived the play. The production was directed by Leah C. Gardiner, with choreography by Camille A. Brown and featured a Deaf actress in the role of \\"Lady in Purple.\\" https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/theater/for- colored-girls-review-ntozake-shange.html American Playhouse television adaptation In 1982 the play was adapted for television on PBS station WNET- TV, as part of the American Playhouse. The adaptation, directed by Oz Scott, was seen as a serious departure from the Broadway production. A review by The New York Times states: \\"What Miss Shange prefers to call a choreopoem has been expanded into realistic settings that too often resemble the sanitized atmosphere of an episode of Good Times. The net result has been a considerable reduction in the work's emotional impact.\\" As a result, the televised production is often seen as a diluted version of the original choreopoem. =Cast= * Sarita Allen: Sechitaa * Trazana Beverley: Crystal (credited as Trazana Beverly) * Laurie Carlos: Georgetta * Gregory T.

Stewart, at Lionsgate's direction, approached Tyler Perry about producing the film. However, Perry told Lionsgate that if he produced it, he also wanted to write and direct it. Perry then usurped the project from Stewart and scrapped her script. The shift prompted controversy over whether Perry had the skill and consciousness to properly depict an iconic feminist work. Stewart remained on in the token position of executive producer of the film. Among those critics were Oprah Winfrey, who expressed doubts over whether the book should be made into a film at all. Others had reservations based on Perry's position at the helm of such an important book in African American literature, particularly considering the controversies raised by Precious, a film he lent his name to.Finke, Nikki (September 16, 2010), \\"Even Oprah Didn't Want Him To Do It!

Legacy The title of For Colored Boys Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Still Not Enough: Coming of Age, Coming Out, and Coming Home, a 2012 anthology of essays edited by Keith Boykin, was based on the title of Shange's play.Moore, Darnell L. (August 10, 2012), \\"TFW Interview: Keith Boykin on 'For Colored Boys'\\", The Feminist Wire. Shange's work has also been transformed using different forms of media.

Etymology The place name originated from the story of Mallika named girl drawn in Ponnozhukum Thodu. Location A bus route from Paika to Pinnakkanadu cuts across Mallikassery. Ponnozhukumthodu, a tributary to the river Meenachil, flows by Mallikassery. Institutions in the village include St. Thomas Church, St. Dominic Savio U.P. School,SNDP.Sree Narayana Guru Temple, and CRM minor seminary. Economy Mallikassery is an agricultural area. Mallikassery is a major rubber producing region, with rubber estates from 100 to 500 acres. Rubber estates in this area were traditionally owned by a wealthy family who had certain affiliations with Murphy saipu, the father of Indian rubber plantation industry. Families in this region assisted the wealthy family either as supervisors or servants in the estate and later shared their property. Mallikassery at present is an Industrial area of Elikulam Panchayath. There are three factories. Eva Hawai,Glenrock Rubber Products and Kokad Pharmaceuticals. There are only three buildings in the local town. Two of them are owned by local church. There is a ration shop and few other grocery shops and some tea shop. There are only a few number of government employees. Children of many parents from this region are settled abroad .

Once isolated from the country in the Caribbean Sea, the island was artificially joined to the western coast of mainland in 1972 by a man-made causeway built from dirt excavated to form the Rodney Bay Marina. Composed of two peaks the island is a historic site with numerous forts such as an 18th- century British fort and Fort Rodney both used by the British to spy on French Ships from neighbouring Martinique. In 1979 it was named a national park and again in 1992 it became a national landmark under the control of the Saint Lucia National Trust (SLNT). Today, Pigeon Island is the home and major venue of the Saint Lucia Jazz Festival. History The Arawak and Carib artifacts date back to around 1000 A.D. In the middle of the 16th century, a French pirate, Fran√ßois le Clerc, used Pigeon Island as his base. Nathaniel Uring landed here in 1722. Between 1779 and 1782, Admiral George Rodney took over Pigeon island, and built Fort Rodney. To establish clear viewpoints, Rodney ordered all trees on Pigeon Island to be cut down. From the higher peak, Signal Hill, Rodney was able to observe the French naval base of Fort Royal on Martinique. In 1782, Admiral Rodney sailed from Pigeon Island to confront the French fleet, which he defeated in the Battle of Saints. Two barracks, with kitchen, were built in 1808 and used until 1901. Additionally, quarters for the commanding officer, and an Officer's Mess were built in 1808. Originally fortified with 4 24 pounders and 2 mortars, the cannons were sold off in 1861. Rodney's 1780 lime kiln was modified to process whale oil in the 1920s, and did so until 1926. Franklin Roosevelt visited the area aboard the USS Tuscaloosa on 8 Dec. 1940. The US Navy built a Naval Air Station at Reduit in 1941 under the Destroyers for Bases Agreement for the Battle of the Caribbean, and used the island as a communication station. A squadron of 18 PBY-5 Catalinas patrolled for German submarines. The station was deactivated on 1 June 1947. The island was connected to the mainland via a causeway in 1971.

It lies on the northern edge of the Agulhas Plain, about south-east of Cape Town and north of Cape Agulhas, the southernmost tip of Africa. Tourist attractions of Bredasdorp include the Heuningberg Nature Reserve, many historical churches, and art galleries and craft shops. Bredasdorp is also home to the Shipwreck Museum which tells the stories of the 150 wrecks along the nearby Agulhas Reef. It is the only museum of its kind in the southern hemisphere. History The town of Bredasdorp was founded with the building of a Dutch Reformed Church in 1838 on the farm Langefontein. The town was named after Michiel van Breda, the first Mayor of Cape Town, who was also known as the father of South Africa's merino sheep industry. Van Breda and Pieter Voltelyn van der Byl could not agree on a location for the church; as a result two churches were built, and two towns, Bredasdorp and Napier, were established. Government Bredasdorp is located in the Cape Agulhas Local Municipality; as the largest town in the municipality, Bredasdorp is divided between its second, third and fourth wards. The local municipality in turn forms part of the Overberg District Municipality; Bredasdorp is the location of the head offices of both municipalities. Geography Bredasdorp is situated at an elevation of between on the slopes of the Heuningberg (Afrikaans for \\"Honey Mountain\\"). There is no significant watercourse flowing through the town, although the Kars Rivier flows past a few kilometres to the east. Bredasdorp shares in the Mediterranean climate experienced in most of the Western Cape. Its proximity to the ocean, which is less than away at Arniston, moderates the variation of temperature. Bredasdorp is mostly surrounded by farmland, chiefly grain, cattle and sheep farming; on the south-west side of the town the Heuningberg Nature Reserve protects the indigenous fynbos vegetation. Demography In the census of 2011, the population of Bredasdorp consisted of 15,524 people living in 4,521 households. 66.5% of the people described themselves as \\"Coloured\\", 19% as \\"White\\" and 12.7% as \\"Black African\\". 83% spoke Afrikaans as their first language, 7.5% spoke Xhosa, and 4.3% spoke English. Economy Canola fields near Bredasdorp Besides the sheep farming, the town also boasts other agricultural activities, including wheat, canola, milk, and indigenous fynbos cultivation. The town is also the location of the offices of Kapula Candles, an international candle company that exports hand- painted candles to Europe and the United States. The population of the town got a boost during the middle 1980s with the establishment of both the South African Air Force's Air Force Base Overberg which is home to the Test Flight and Development Centre as well as the Denel Overberg Test Range near the small coastal village of Arniston.

Coats of arms Municipality (1) ‚Äî In 1938, the town council adopted a pseudo-heraldic \\"coat of arms\\". The shield depicted a map of South Africa, with a dot marking Bredasdorp. In the centre of the map was a disc displaying a sheaf of wheat, a merino ram, a goat and a protea flower. A lighthouse was placed above the shield.Depicted in the South African Railways and Harbours publication Bredasdorp and its District (1941). Municipality (2) ‚Äî The council assumed a proper coat of arms in 1966.

After demolishing of the ramparts and gates it became a ring of streets around the center of Moscow, Russia. It is the third historical ring of Moscow (after Boulevard Ring and Garden Ring), with a total length of 37 kilometers,Russian: –≠–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è \\"–ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞\\", –ú, 1997 partially integrated into the modern Third Ring circular highway. Kamer-Kollezhsky Val is not a road ring in a strict sense, as it has no crossings over the Moskva River. The rampart was built in 1731-1742 by Kamer Collegium (tax authority, one of 12 colleges of Peter I), originally as an earth wall with 16 (later 18) guarded checkpoints (–∑–∞—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∞, zastava) for internal passport control and taxing the cargoes. By 1806, it became Moscow's police border, by 1864 - the administrative border between the city, controlled by Moscow City Hall and country, controlled by Zemstvo. Checkpoints were abandoned in 1852, and all fortifications gradually demolished. Names of streets and squares on the site of old rampart end in Russian words Val (Rampart) and Zastava (Checkpoint), i.e. Rogozhsky Val. Exceptions: * Izmailovsky Val, a part of Kamer-Kollezhsky Val, emerged in 1930s after draining the ponds east of Yauza River * Korovy Val and Zemlyanoy Val actually belong to Garden Ring, not Kamer-Kollezhsky Val During the Communist rule, some of these streets were renamed after revolutionaries, however preserving the archaic elements Val and Zastava, which resulted in ridiculous names like Frunzensky Val (lit. Frunze's Rampart, the historical name Khamovnichesky Val was restored in 1986 even before Perestroika actually began) and Abel'manovskaya Zastava (lit. Abelman's Checkpoint, the name persist up to now). This was a source of jokes. Territories around the rampart developed in the second half of the 19th century as industrial, working-class neighborhoods. The Third Ring, built in the 1990s, coincides with the rampart in its northern segment; in the north-eastern segment (Lefortovo), the rampart extends beyond Third Ring; elsewhere, the Third Ring extends beyond the rampart.

As her talent developed, her pieces became increasingly abstract and refined.https://craftcouncil.org/post/mariska- karaszs-adventures-stitchery American Craft Council Mariska soon established a successful career as a fashion designer. Her foreign background and new American identity defined her custom clothing for women in the 1920s, which combined Hungarian folk elements with a modern American style. In the early 1930s, after her marriage to Donald Peterson and the births of her two daughters, Solveig and Rosamond, Karasz began designing modern children's clothing, which was admired by parents, scholars, and critics for its practicality and originality. Her career in fashion ended in the early 1940s, following a studio fire and the entry of the United States into World War II. Mariska Karasz died in 1960, aged 62 years.\\"Mariska Kavasz is Dead at 62; Needlework Artist and Author\\" New York Times (August 28, 1960): 83. Artistic career In 1947, during the rise of American studio craft and abstract expressionism, Karasz began creating embroidered wall hangings. She exhibited her work in museums and galleries across the county, in over 50 solo shows during the 1950s. She also authored the book Adventures in Stitches in 1949 (republished in an expanded version in 1959), an influential book on creative needlework, and served as guest needlework editor for House Beautiful from 1952-1953. The first retrospective of her work took place at the Georgia Museum of Art from January 20 to April 15, 2007. In 2010 her work was included in the exhibition \\"Textiles Recycled/Reimagined\\" at the Baltimore Museum of Art.Textiles Recycled/Reimagined at the Baltimore Museum of Art Publications  * References *Callahan, Ashley: Modern Threads: Fashion and Art by Mariska Karasz.

Based on the classic book by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, the musical deviates from the original in that aviator Toni, whose plane crashes in the Sahara Desert, explicitly is real- life author Saint-Exup√©ry, and the plot alternates flashbacks to actual events in his life with his interaction with the fictional Little Prince, a refugee from Asteroid B-612. Undaunted by the critical and commercial failure of the 1974 musical screen adaptation by Lerner and Loewe, A. Joseph Tandet, a co- producer of the movie who owned the rights to the story, proceeded with his plans for a Broadway production. To save money, he decided to forgo an out-of- town tryout. Previews were originally scheduled to begin on December 31, 1981 at the Alvin Theatre. The first preview was canceled at the last minute, after a change in both director and choreographer late in the rehearsal period; the production actually began previews on January 1, 1982. Late in rehearsals, Robert Kalfin was replaced as director by Jerry Adler and Billy Wilson replaced original choreographer Dania Krupska.\\"'Little Prince' suffering some growing pains\\" Daily News, December 30, 1981 The production starred Michael York as the Aviator and Anthony Rapp as the Little Prince, with Ellen Greene in a supporting role.Ken Mandelbaum.

It is published by Guardians of Order, the producers of the Big Eyes Small Mouth game and the Slayers d20 game. The system presents a DC-based Magic System similar to the Sovereign Stone game published by Sovereign Press. Dynamic spellcasting Advanced d20 Magic introduces a new spellcasting system called Dynamic Spellcasting to the d20 System. Dynamic Spellcasting is an alternative system to the standard \\"Vancian\\" System that was based on the magic system in Jack Vance's Dying Earth series. Instead of memorizing and preparing spells, a spellcaster can cast any spell he or she knows as a standard action without any special ingredients or other actions. In effect, a spellcaster can cast any spell he or she knows as often as she desires. This is balanced by the fact that a spellcaster must save against spell drain. In BESM d20, this is represented by the fact that a spell drains energy points. In a regular Fantasy d20 game, this is represented by the spellcaster inflicting non-lethal damage on himself or herself. DC based spells In Advanced d20 Magic each spell in the SRD is assigned a Difficulty Class. This Difficulty Class is nominally based on the Wizard class in the Dungeons & Dragons game, and the base difficulty class ranges from 10 for 0-level spells, to 51 for 9th level spells. These DCs are further modified by other properties of the spell‚Äîwhether or not if they require time to cast the spell or material components in the regular Vancian system. DC based item creation Also, in Advanced d20 Magic is a DC based item creation system. Also dynamically different from the standard Item Creation Rules in the d20 system, a Spellcaster isn't limited by what magic spell to use or what level to determine a spell's potency. Instead, he or she can use any similar spell such as Fireball, Flame Blade, or Flaming Sphere to create a flaming sword. The player just needs to create the item, the gamemaster needs to set a difficulty, and the player needs to roll a fortitude save against the difficulty class. It's that simple. Spells already converted There is a large number of spells already converted to the Advanced d20 Magic system. These come out of the SRD. Every spell that is in the Dungeons and Dragons Player's Handbook is already converted. Also included in the system is a spell conversion system so a Gamemaster can convert his favorite spells from other resources.  Criticisms against dynamic spellcasting  Critics cite the heavy use of mathematics involved in the Dynamic Spellcasting mechanics. A player needs to do some hefty calculations which could slow game play, because there are so many options for modifying the fortitude saving throw against spell drain. For instance, a fifth level Wizard in order to cast Fireball (DC 31) would have a +5 spellcasting modifier. Plus he can cast it as an Invocation (+5), an Evocation (+5), and add expendable foci (+2) = which brings the DC down to 14. And the mage can bring it down by adding other options. Such math can slow down game play for some players.  External links  *RPG.net Review of Advanced d20 Magic. *Gamewyrd Page on Advanced d20 Magic *Enworld Review of Advanced d20 Magic.

Origin This apple was grown in 1708 from one of three apple pips sent from Normandy to Sir Henry Goodricke of Ribston Hall at Little Ribston near Knaresborough, Yorkshire; the original trunk did not die until 1835. It then sent up a new shoot and, on the same root, lived until 1928. Ribston Pippin. The 'Ribston Pippin' is one of the possible parents of 'Cox's Orange Pippin'. Description The apple skin is a yellow, flushed orange, streaked red with russet at the base and apex. The yellow flesh is firm, fine-grained, and sweet with a pear taste. Irregularly shaped and sometimes lopsided, the apple is usually round to conical in shape and flattened at the base with distinct ribbing. Weather conditions during ripening cause a marbling or water coring of the flesh, and in very hot weather, the fruit will ripen prematurely. Culture A vigorous tree with upright growth, its medium-sized ovate to oval-shaped leaves are a deep green color and distinctly folded with sharp, regular, and shallow serrations. The surface of the leaf is smooth and dull with a heavy pubescence. It is very slow to begin bearing, and the proper pollinators will increase the fruitfulness. 'Lord Lambourne' has been recommended for a pollinator, as well as 'Adam's Pearmain', 'James Grieve', and 'Egremont Russet'. 'Ribston Pippin' has one of the highest vitamin C contents; 30 mg/100g. In literature The apple appears in a verse by Hilaire Belloc called \\"The False Heart\\": > I said to Heart, \\"How goes it?\\" Heart replied: \\"Right as a Ribstone Pippin!\\" > But it lied. The apple appears in Thomas Hardy's The Return of the Native in the second book, chapter two: \\"Now a few russets, Tamsin. He used to like those as well as ribstones.\\" In the Sherlock Holmes story \\"The Adventure of Black Peter\\" in The Return of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle an incidental character is described as a \\"a little Ribston pippin of a man, with ruddy cheeks and fluffy side-whiskers\\". In The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens a character is described as a \\"little hard-headed, Ribston pippin-faced man.\\" Later in the novel a clerk \\"peeled and ate three Ribston pippins...\\" In the story \\"Thoughts about People\\" in Dickens' Sketches by Boz , a London apprentice is described as having \\"a watch about the size and shape of a reasonable Ribston pippin...\\" Irish writer Helen Wykham's first novel was titled Ribstone Pippins and had Belloc's poem as its epigraph.Helen Wykham, Ribstone Pippins. Dublin: Allen Figgis & Co., 1974. In A Month in the Country by J. L. Carr, a character says, \\"I've brought you a bag of apples.

It is a formal method providing component-based model-driven software development. Overview rCOS was originally developed by He Jifeng, Zhiming Liu and Xiaoshan Li at UNU-IIST in Macau, and consists of a unified multi-view modeling notation with a theory of relational semantic and graph-based operational semantics, a refinement calculus and tool support for model construction, model analysis and verification, and model transformations. Model transformations automate refinement rules and design patterns and generate conditions as proof obligations. rCOS support multiple dimensional modeling: models at different levels of abstraction related by refinement relations, hierarchy of compositions of components, and models of different views of the system (interaction protocols of components, reactive behaviors of components, data functionality, and class structures and data types). Components are composed and integrated based on their models of interfaces to support third party composition.

The Manitoba Club was originally established as a gentleman's club in 1874.  History  The club was once known as \\"the famous Manitoba Club\\" across Canada and throughout the northern United States. Dignitaries who have visited the club include Mark Twain, General William Tecumseh Sherman, Princes of Monaco, Jordan and Iran, every Canadian Prime Minister through the 1940s, the British High Commissioner and many others. Sir Hugh John Macdonald, the son of Canada's first Prime Minister, served as President of the Manitoba Club from 1896 to 1899‚Äîshortly before the construction of its current home. He also became the leader of the fledgling Manitoba Conservative Party in 1897, and was elected the 8th Premier of Manitoba in Dec. 1899, as MLA for Winnipeg South. The old Manitoba Club building on Garry St. was sold to Donald E. McKenty for $30,000. and then sold again three weeks later to Fred Richardson for $35,000. The building was officially opened by Sir Albert Henry George Grey, 4th Earl Grey, Governor General of Canada, on October 10, 1905. The Club announced in April 1904 that it would be moving from 298 Garry St. to a new building at the corner of Broadway and Fort St. Two months later, the building's foundation was laid. The Institute for stained glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at the Manitoba Club. In 2017 the Club made plans to add a Cigar Room on the top floor.

Geography and hydrology Bhojpur, general plan of the site showing location of temples and dams. River BetwƒÅ at Bhojpur, showing fallen remains of the southern dam. Bhojpur is situated on the BetwƒÅ River, 28 km from Bhopal, the state capital of Madhya Pradesh. The site is located on sandstone ridges typical of central India, next to a deep gorge through which the BetwƒÅ River flows. Two large dams, constructed of massive hammer-dressed stones, were built in the eleventh century to divert and block the BetwƒÅ, so creating a large lake. The approximate size of the lake is shown in the site plan given here. Bhojpur, northern dam showing cyclopean masonry construction. The dams were constructed of cyclopean masonry on a massive scale. The dam to the north is preserved, but the one immediately below the temple was knocked down by an exceptional surge in the Monsoon that occurred in the mid-eleventh century.Ashish Sinha et al, \\"A global context for megadroughts in monsoon Asia during the past millennium,\\" Quaternary Science Reviews 30, no. 1‚Äì2 (January 2011): 47-62 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2010.10.005; B. Buckley, R. Fletcher, S. Wang, B. Zottoli and C. Pottier, ‚ÄúMonsoon extremes and society over the past millennium on mainland Southeast Asia,‚Äù Quaternary Science Reviews 95 (2014): 1-19. A myth about the Bhojpur dams has emerged thanks to the writing of William Kincaid.W. Kincaid, \\"Rambles among ruins in central India,\\" The Indian Antiquary 17 (1888): 348‚Äì52. He mis-interpreted an account in a Persian chronicle (recording that a dam was opened on the orders of Hoshang Shah of Malwa), as referring to Bhojpur, an idea elaborated by U. N. Day in 1965 and repeated subsequently in the years that followed. U. N. Day, Medieval Malwa: a Political and Cultural History, 1401‚Äì1562. (Delhi, 1965): appendix. Available for download at: Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1063928 The account, translated by U. N. Day from Persian, states that the king pulled down a dam at the request of local merchants in Bhopal and Vidisha whose caravans were being raided by bandits who would take refuge at an inaccessible spot protected by the lake. This account refers to the Bhojtal at Bhopal where even today an island in the middle of the lake can be seen. The dam at Bhopal was subsequently repaired and further raised when the Kamlapati Palace was constructed in the eighteenth century. History Bhojpur takes its name from king Bhoja (reg. c. 1000‚Äì1055 CE), the most celebrated ruler of the ParamƒÅra dynasty.Arvind K. Singh, \\"Interpreting the History of the ParamƒÅras,\\" Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 3, 22, 1 (2012), pp. 13‚Äì28. Online version: http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=JRA There is no archaeological evidence from Bhojpur before the eleventh century, a fact confirmed by local legends which recount how Bhoja made a vow to build a series of dams \\"to arrest the streams of nine rivers and ninety-nine rivulets\\". A location was found in the kingdom that allowed the king to fulfil this vow and the dams were duly built at Bhojpur.John Malcolm, Report on the Province of Malwa, and adjoining Districts (Calcutta, 1822), p. 19. Places of historical and archaeological importance = Bhoje≈õvar or BhojasvƒÅmin temple = The li·πÖga at the BhojasvƒÅmin temple, Bhojpur Bhojpur is famous for the incomplete Bhoje≈õvar temple dedicated to Shiva. The site is under the protection of the Archaeological Survey of India as a monument of national importance. The temple houses one of the largest li·πÖga-s in India, 5.5 m (18 ft) tall and 2.3 m (7.5 ft) in circumference. It is crafted out a single rock.Bhojpur name=\\"unfinished_dream\\">Unfinished dream The li·πÖga was repaired by the Archaeological Survey of India who also added a roof over the top to prevent weather damage. The attribution of the temple to Bhoja is based on the testimony of Merutu·πÖga, who reports in the PrabandhacintƒÅma·πái that Bhoja bestowed on the poet MƒÅgha \\"all the merit of the new BhojasvƒÅmin temple that he was about to build himself\\", and then \\"set out for the country of MƒÅlava\\".Cited in M. Willis, \\"DhƒÅr, Bhoja and Sarasvatƒ´: from Indology to Political Mythology and Back,\\" Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 22, 1 (2012), p. 130.

The style of the sculpture on the building confirms an early to mid-eleventh- century date for the structure. The building as it stands consists of the inner cella or garbhag·πõha, supported by massive pillars, surmounted with an elegant corbelled dome. The outer walls and superstructure of the temple were never built, but unfinished parts lie nearby. = Quarries and rock drawings = Architectural fragments in one of the quarries at Bhojpur The temple at Bhojpur is unique in being left unfinished, with a series of large architectural parts still located in the quarries where the stones were cut and fashioned. In addition, there are a significant number of architectural drawings engraved on the flat surfaces of the quarry showing mouldings, pillars, and temple plans.K. K. Chakravarty, Bhojpur Temple, a vision of harmony (Bhopal, 1991) Also of note is the large earthen ramp behind the temple which shows how medieval craftsmen raised the large blocks of stone into position. The drawings and architectural parts have been subject to in- depth study and with a book on the subject published by the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts.

On the base of the central images of Lord Shatinath there is an inscription mentioning king Bhoja, the only epigraphic evidence connecting Bhoja to the site.D. C. Sircar, \\"Three Paramara Inscriptions\\", Epigraphica Indica 35 (1963‚Äì64), p. 186; H. V. Trivedi, Inscriptions of the ParamƒÅras, 2, pp. 60‚Äì61. The Suparshanath image on left has an inscription date samvat 1157 which mentions Naravarman, the nephew of king Bhoja, and mentions that the two smaller idols were installed by the grandson of Nemichandra of Vemaka community, who had installed the main image in the middle Kasturchand Jain Suman, Bharatiya Digambar Jain Abhilekh aur Tirth Parichay, Madhya-Pradesh: 13 vi shati tak, Delhi, 2001, p. 80The same temple complex hosts shrine for ƒÄcƒÅrya Manatunga who wrote Bhaktamara Stotra. Main Temple & Idol This huge temple was established in year 1100 AD. The miraculous idol of principal deity Bhagwan Shantinath in standing posture (22¬Ω feet in height) is installed in the huge sanctum of this temple. On the both sides of this idol, 2 standing beautiful idols of Bhagwan Parshvanath & Suparshvanath (7th Teerthankar) 8 feet in height each are installed. Near the feet of Bhagwan Shantinath, artistic whisk bearers are carved on both sides. = Cave of PƒÅrvatƒ´ = Immediately opposite the temple, on the west side of the gorge facing the BetwƒÅ, is a rock-shelter or cave, now occupied by religious mendicants. Popularly known as PƒÅrvatƒ´'s Cave, the cave contains a number of sculptures and architectural fragments dating to the eleventh century. = Remains of Bhoja's Royal Palace = One of the avenues in the ruins of the royal palace at Bhojpur On the low plateau above the Cave of PƒÅrvatƒ´ and opposite the Bhojpur temple are the remains of Bhoja's palace. Only the foundations survive. The complex is laid out as a grid in a square, with a courtyard in the centre (see site plan above). It is oriented on an exact north-south axis as prescribed in the SamarƒÅ·πÖganas≈´tradhƒÅra, an architectural treatise ascribed to Bhoja.Mattia Salvini, \\"The SamarƒÅ·πÖganas≈´tradhƒÅra: Themes and Context for the Science of VƒÅstu,\\" Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 22, 1 (2012), pp. 35‚Äì55. Online version: http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=JRA. Among the many features of interest are unfinished carved blocks and graffiti engraved on the rock floor. The latter includes diagrams for games and a series of names dating to the eleventh century and later. The palace is a unique survival, being the only medieval building of its kind in northern India. Its association with Bhoja and its close conformity to a text ascribed to the king mark it out as a site of national and international cultural importance. The site of the palace, like the neighbouring dams, is unprotected. The remains of the palace are being slowly destroyed as local people collect stones for modern building purposes.  Cultural activities and festivals  Every year, on the occasion of Maha Shivaratri, a big mela is organized at Bhojpur.Place of Interest: Bhojpur Gallery File:Jain_temple_old_statue.jpgJain temple old statue File:Parvati cave WIKI.jpgRock shelter at Bhojpur popularly known as PƒÅrvatƒ´'s Cave File:Bhojpur interior, ceiling.jpgInterior of the temple dome at Bhojpur, before conservation File:BHOJPUR Sati pillar.JPGSatƒ´ pillar beside the Bhojpur temple, probably 18th century.

Business plan competition futureSAX The competition is possible due to Businessplan-Wettbewerb Sachsen GmbH (BPWS), which is operated by the Sachsen Aufbaubank - F√∂rderbank. =Conditions for participation= People with an idea for an innovative product or service with high market potential is entitled to take part in FutureSAX for free. A condition is that the enterprise has a need for finances and the instatement of the business idea is intended to be in the state of Saxony. At least one team member must be able to provide proof of residency or work place in Saxony. Procedure FutureSAX is divided into three competition phases, in which the competing participants are aided under consultation in the development of their own business plans. During the course of the competition, the business ideas continually evolve; the participants profit from free seminar programs and the opportunity to correspond with others in their industry as well as sponsors of the competition. On the basis of a business or development idea (phase one), the production of a business and marketing strategy develops (phase two) and a detailed and professional business plan (phase three) is constructed. Each phase ends with a confidential evaluation of the practicality of the business ideas by independent juries. The business plans that have the most judicial approval are awarded with prize money. For the first two award ceremonies, four teams are awarded - one team each per the industries of technology, ITK, bio/nano- technology, and service. With the third award ceremony, five prizes in the three categories of ‚Äústart-ups‚Äù, ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù, and ‚Äúspecial university prize‚Äù are awarded. Apart from the phase's closing jury vote, the technical support is guaranteed to the competitors by sponsors, such as regularly offered coaching and seminar meetings about start-up relevant information. Apart from the technical support with the development of business plans through FutureSAX, the opportunity is granted to the competitors to establish contacts to financial sources such as Venture Capitalists, etc. at the FutureSAX networking seminars. History On 7 November 2002, FutureSAX started as a Saxony industry competition for start-ups and recent growth enterprises. Thus, it replaced the IT Business Plan Competition, which was exclusive for the IT- industry that had existed since 1999 and was also presented by FutureSAX. Since 2002, more than 490 start-ups and entrepreneurs, as well as 10,000 participants in net-working meetings and workshops, have taken part in FutureSAX. However, in the 2006 competition, 140 teams took part and 188 business ideas, marketing concepts, and business plans were submitted. During the years 2003 through 2005, the competition grew approximately 67 percent. On October 5, 2006, FutureSAX launched into its fifth open-industry competition, which ran until 18 July 2007. The total prize money amounted to 68,000 euros.

The movie is based on the true story of the Jaswinder Kaur Sidhu murder. The film was screened at the Asian Festival of First Films on November 26, 2005 and was first aired on CBC on February 6, 2006. Plot In India, a young woman is kidnapped, and her young male companion beaten within an inch of his life. He is working class Sikh, Surinder Singh; she is his wife, the former Davinder Samra, a Canadian Sikh whom he met when she visited India a year earlier for her cousin's wedding. For both, it was love at first sight. However, Davinder comes from a traditional Sikh family, who made their fortune in Canada. Her parents, who knew nothing of Surinder when Surinder and Davinder eloped, were seeking a suitable husband for her. As the story unfolds leading to the kidnapping/beating and the subsequent investigation by the local police and Crime Investigation Division, the power of money and of Sikh family honor is shown.

His work dates from 1864 (when he set himself up in practice) to around 1912. His earliest surviving known building dates from 1866. Early life Born Fothergill Watson in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire in 1841, he was the son of wealthy Nottingham Lace merchant Robert Watson and Mary Ann Fothergill. He changed his name to Watson Fothergill in 1892 to continue his maternal family name. Family He married Anne Hage in 1867 at St. John's Church, Mansfield. They had the following children: *Marian Watson (1868-1955) *Annie Forbes Watson (1869-1930) *Edith Mary Watson (1871-1936) *Eleanor Fothergill Watson (1872-1946) *Samuel Fothergill Watson (1875-1915) *Harold H Watson (b.1877) *Clarice Watson (1877-1955) His father-in-law was Samuel Hage, one of the founding partners of Mansfield Brewery. His half- brother was Robert Mackie Watson, chairman of the Mansfield Improvement Commission and the Brunts' Charity. Career In 1856, he entered the St Peter‚Äôs Gate office of Frederick Jackson, an architect and surveyor in Nottingham. In mid 1860 he moved as assistant to Isaac Charles Gilbert who was based in Clinton Street, Nottingham. After spending around 18 months with Gilbert, he moved in early 1862 to join the office of Arthur William Blomfield in London. In 1864 he was working with John Middleton in Cheltenham, but in the same year, left to set up his own office at 6 Clinton Street, Nottingham. He remained at Clinton Street until it was demolished by the works in connection with the arrival of the Great Central Railway in 1894. He moved to a new temporary office at 18 George Street, and arranged to rebuild 15 George Street opposite which he completed the next year and moved in on 12 December 1895. He was in partnership with Lawrence George Summers from 1880 and he retired in 1912. He is credited as having had a great impact on the architecture of the major British industrial city of Nottingham, and designed over a hundred buildings in the city, from offices, banks and warehouses, to churches and private dwelling houses. His easily recognisable style includes the use of contrasting horizontal bands of red and blue brick, dark timber eaves and balconies, and elaborate turrets and stone carving. On his death in 1928, he left an estate valued at ¬£73,908 5s 11d ().

Machlett was a large producer of the tubes and developed accessories to be used with them as well. For its contributions to World War II efforts, the US government gave it an \\"E\\" award in 1945. The company was bought by Varian in 1989. History The company began as E. Machlett and Son, which was founded in 1897 in New York City, United States as scientific glass makers. =Early days= Machlett Laboratories was created from E. Machlett & Sons in order to exploit the then new technology of X-rays. They made X-ray tubes from the beginning to 1989 when they were bought by Varian. In addition to making X-ray tubes, they manufactured high-power vacuum tubes for use in radio and TV broadcasting (857B mercury-vapor half-wave rectifier tube) and for industrial induction heating. Those two sides of the business were about equivalent for most of the life of the company. Machlett Laboratories, Inc. was established on Hope Street and Camp Avenue in 1934. This manufacturing operation began making X-ray tubes and became the largest producer of its kind in the world. Raymond was president of the company, founded by his father Robert, a scientist who made the first practical X-ray tube in America and devoted his life to making it safe and successful in the field of medicine. Robert Machlett associated with Madame Curie and other leading roentgenologists to make this happen. They moved to 1063 Hope St. in Stamford, Connecticut, in the early 20th century, and remained there. Among their achievements was a counter made by them for Irene and Frederic Joliot-Curie for use in their experiments on artificial radioactivity in 1934 which is currently contained in the Science Museum in Great Britain. They were given an ‚ÄúE‚Äù award by the US government in 1945 for their contribution to the war effort. no longer at 1063 Hope St. Products =Transmitting tubes= Machlett Labs 298A radio transmission tube, ca. 1958. This was the largest transmission tube made. This one is on display at the Georgia Museum of Radio History in St. Marys, GA, USA. Machlett was well known for its rather complete line of transmitting tubes, most particularly triodes. For quite a while, Machlett's 6697shttp://www.datasheetarchive.com/ML-6697A-datasheet.html were the most- used Class B modulator tubes (as a push-pull pair) and Class C final tubes (as a single-ended pair) in 50,000-watt plate-modulated AM transmitters. In a classical Doherty amplifier (a Class B \\"carrier\\" tube and a Class C \\"peak\\" tube), 50,000 watts could be achieved using only two 6697s, but the drive requirement was about 5,000 watts, so the driver was often a complete 5,000-watt transmitter. The driver power could be \\"passed through\\" (i.e., was not dissipated as heat) if the carrier tube was operated with a grounded grid and, as before, the peak tube was operated with a grounded cathode.Continental Electronics 317B Later, chief competitor Eimac released tetrodes which rather quickly eclipsed Machlett's triodes, as tetrodes have higher gain (thereby requiring much lower driver power, usually about 1,000 watts for 50,000 watts out), and do not require \\"neutralization\\". And tetrodes can be screen-grid modulated, especially in a Sainton-modified Doherty amplifier, where both the \\"carrier\\" and \\"peak\\" tubes may be operated in Class C.Continental Electronics 317C 6697s were also employed in RCA's upgraded Ampliphase transmitter, the BTA-50H. CPI's Econco division remanufactures Eimac and Machlett power tubes. =X-ray tubes= They were the first company to utilize the concept of the rotating anode, something which is just about universal in medical X-ray systems at this date. Towards the end of the time of manufacture, they were producing oil-circulating X-ray tubes with a heat exchanger attached (for use with computed tomography (CT) scanners), with 5-inch diameter rotating anodes formed from tungsten-rhenium alloy and molybdenum, with a large mass of graphite attached to act as a heat sink. Smaller tubes without graphite heat sinks had highly radiative coatings to disperse the generated heat into the oil surrounding the tube itself. The manufacture of X-ray tubes was licensed to two other companies, GEC Medical and Comet SA of Bern in Switzerland. Machlett X-ray tube The Machlett X-ray tube was produced to ‚Äòprovide electrostatic protection for the filament (cathode) so as to permit long life to be achieved at operating voltages in the range 100-300 kV‚Äô i . The X-ray tube was designed and manufactured by E. Machlett & Son who were specialists in scientific glass instruments. The American company, which was established in New York 1897, began as a single shop and soon grew into an internationally recognized firm. The Machlett X-ray tube was patented in April 1934; one of its tubes, at the University of Melbourne's School of Physics, is from 1937. These X-ray tubes may have been used by Professor T.H Laby‚Äôs X-ray group, which was a priority research topic there. This interest was sparked by the appointment in 1889 of Professor T. R. Lyle. Lyle, who was head of the school until 1915, is thought to have been the first person in Australia to have taken an X-ray photograph iii. A photocopy of this photograph can be found in the School of Physics Archive. For this particular experiment, Lyle actually made his own x-ray tube. His successor, Laby, continued to work with X-rays. During the 1920s he worked on the X-ray spectra of atoms and in 1930 he, along with Dr C. E. Eddy, published Quantitative Analysis by X-Ray Spectroscopy iv . Also with Eddy Laby produced the paper \\"Sensitivity of Atomic Analysis by X-rays\\". Laby went on to have an X-ray spectrograph of his own design manufactured by Adam Hilger Ltd. =Accessories= As well as X-ray tubes, they manufactured collimators ‚Äì to define the beam size ‚Äì and three marks of ‚ÄúDynalyser‚Äù ‚Äì an invasive instrument for measuring all the important parameters in an X-ray tube. This consisted of an HV unit insulated with SF6, and an indicating unit. A separate radiation monitor could be used with this, and an oscilloscope could also be attached to this device if desired. Some 2,500 of the most recent version were sold, and this device survived the sale of the company to Varian and later buyers, being in production from the early 1980s to around 1995. There were three generations of the Dynalyzer produced.

The letter gave instructions on how the clergy should deal with and respond to lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. Pope John Paul II approved the letter and ordered its publication. It was designed to correct misunderstandings and misinterpretations of a 1975 CDF letter, Declaration on Certain Questions Concerning Sexual Ethics (Persona Humana). Ratzinger clarified that the Church's teaching on the sinfulness of homosexual acts is much more nuanced than is commonly believed by the media and by some Catholics: > It has been argued that the homosexual orientation in certain cases is not > the result of deliberate choice; and so the homosexual person would then > have no choice but to behave in a homosexual fashion. Lacking freedom, such > a person, even if engaged in homosexual activity, would not be culpable. > Here, the Church's wise moral tradition is necessary since it warns against > generalizations in judging individual cases. In fact, circumstances may > exist, or may have existed in the past, which would reduce or remove the > culpability of the individual in a given instance; or other circumstances > may increase it. What is at all costs to be avoided is the unfounded and > demeaning assumption that the sexual behaviour of homosexual persons is > always and totally compulsive and therefore inculpable. In the letter the cardinal stated, \\"Although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder. ....It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action. Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church's pastors wherever it occurs.\\"On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons\\", CDF, 1 October 1986 Ratzinger asserted that, while Christians rightly oppose any violence against homosexual persons, it is wrong to then claim that the homosexual orientation is good or neutral: > But the proper reaction to crimes committed against homosexual persons > should not be to claim that the homosexual condition is not disordered. When > such a claim is made and when homosexual activity is consequently condoned, > or when civil legislation is introduced to protect behaviour to which no one > has any conceivable right, neither the Church nor society at large should be > surprised when other distorted notions and practices gain ground, and > irrational and violent reactions increase.

Mental distress can potentially lead to a change of behavior, affect a person's emotions in a negative way, and affect their relationships with the people around them. Certain traumatic life experiences such as: bereavement, stress, lack of sleep, use of drugs or alcohol, assault, abuse or accidents can induce mental distress. This may be something which resolves without further medical intervention, though people who endure such symptoms longer term are more likely to be diagnosed with mental illness. This definition is not without controversy as some mental health practitioners would use the terms mental distress and mental illness interchangeably. Some users of mental health services prefer the term mental distress in describing their experience as they feel it better captures that sense of the unique and personal nature of their experience, while also making it easier to relate to, since everyone experiences distress at different times. The term also fits better with the social model of disability. Difference between mental distress and mental disorder As noted before, some psychiatrists may use these two terms interchangeably. However, it can be argued that there are fundamental variations between mental distress and mental disorder. Mental distress has a wider scope than the related term mental illness. Mental illness refers to a specific set of medically defined conditions. A person in mental distress may exhibit some of the broader symptoms described in psychiatry, without actually being ‚Äòill‚Äô in a medical sense. People with mental distress may also exhibit temporary symptoms on a daily basis, while patients diagnosed with mental disorder may potentially have to be treated by a psychiatrist. Types The following are types of major mental distress:https://ethnomed.org/patient- education/mental-health/mental-english-rev.pdf * Anxiety disorder * Post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) * Depression * Bipolar disorderhttp://www.mentalhealth.com/home/dx/bipolar.html * Schizophrenia Symptoms and causes The symptoms for mental distress include a wide range of physical to mental conditions.http://www.webmd.com/mental- health/features/10-signs-ailing-mind?page=4 Physical symptoms may include sleep disturbance, anorexia (lack of appetite), loss of menstruation for women, headaches, chronic pain, and fatigue. Mental conditions may include difficulty in anger management, compulsive/obsessive behavior, a significant change in social behavior, a diminished sexual desire, and mood swings. Minor mental distress cases are caused by stress in daily problems, such as forgetting your car keys or being late for an event. However, the major types of mental distress (see section above) can be caused by other important factors. It is important to distinguish between Chemical imbalances in the brain is one of the causes that happen when there is a disequilibrium of chemicals inside the brain's neural pathways, that can lead to irrational decisions and emotional pain.https://socialanxietyinstitute.org/social- anxiety-chemical-imbalances-brain-neural-pathways For example when your brain lacks serotonin, a chemical primary in regulating a brain's functioning, this deficiency of serotonin can lead to depression, appetite changes, aggression, and anxiety. A second cause for mental distress can be exposure to severely distressing experiences, such as life threatening situations and experiences. A third cause, although in very rare cases, can be inheritance. Some research has shown that very few people may have the genetics for the potential to develop mental distress. However, there are many factors that must be accounted for. Mental distress is not a contagious disease that can be caught like the common cold. Mental distress is a psychological condition.https://ethnomed.org/patient-education/mental-health/mental-english- rev.pdf In the United States =Among African-Americans= The social disparities associated with mental health in the Black community have remained constant over time. According to the Office of Minority Health, Black people comprise 12.9% of the U.S. population, yet they are 30% more likely than European Americans to report serious psychological distress. Moreover Black people are more likely to have Major Depressive Disorder, and communicate higher instances of intense symptoms/disability.Shim et al., 2009 For this reason, researchers have attempted to examine the sociological causes and systemic inequalities which contribute to these disparities in order to highlight issues for further investigation.Hunter & Schmidt, 2010; Gonzalez et al., 2008; Shim et al., 2009; Griffith et al., 2009; Levin, 2008 Nonetheless, much of the research on the mental well-being of Black people are unable to separate race, culture, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, or behavioural and biological factors.Griffith et al., 2009 According to Hunter and Schmidt (2010), there are three distinct beliefs embraced by Black people which speak to their socio-cultural experience in the United States: racism, stigma associated with mental illness, and the importance of physical health. According to Raymond Depaulo, M.D., African Americans are less likely to report depression due to heavy social stigma within their community and culture. All of these social aspects of mental health can create a lot of distress. Therefore, discrimination within the healthcare community and larger society, attitudes related to mental health, and general physical health contribute largely to the mental well-being of Black people .Hunter & Schmidt, 2010 There are also disparities with mental health when it comes to Black women. One of the reasons why Black women tend to hesitate when it comes to mental health support and treatment is the aura of the Strong Black Woman schema or S.B.W. According to Watson and Hunter, Various scholars have traced the origins of the S.B.W. race-gender schema to slavery and have suggested that the schema persists because of the struggles that African-American women continue to experience, such as financial hardship‚Ä¶racism, and sexism. Watson and Hunter state that Black women, due to the Strong Black Woman schema have a tendency to handle tough and difficult situations alone.  Demographic and societal factors  There has been a history of disparity and exclusion in regards to the treatment of Black Americans which consists of slavery, imprisonment in the criminal justice system, the inability to vote, marry, attend school, or own property amongst other factors. These factors have attributed to the increase of mental distress in the Black community and due to the lack of resources afforded/known in the community also leads to a lack of resources and treatments available for members of the community to seek and receive some for of help. African-American youth Comparable to their adult counterparts, Black adolescents experience mental health disparities.

This vehicle is currently used to give rides to visitors. Route 8 was electrified in 1895 as a streetcar running from Towson to Catonsville. Back then, it served the corridors of York Road, Greenmount Avenue, and Frederick Road through downtown Baltimore. Another streetcar, known as \\"no. 7,\\" operated a short-turn version of this route from Govanstown to Irvington before being absorbed into no. 8 in 1931. In 1963, the line was converted into a bus operation, retaining this route. The no. 8 streetcar was the final streetcar line of Baltimore to undergo a conversion into a bus service. Herbert H. Harwood (2003). Baltimore Streetcars: The Postwar Years. Johns Hopkins University Press. pp 22-29. . There were also various branches of Route 8 added over the years to communities including Mt. Washington (added in 1972, designated 8A), Cockeysville (operated 1973-1989, designated 8B), Providence/Springlake (operated 1973-1989, designated 8D and 8E), Eudowood, the Towson State University campus, and Stella Maris nursing home, which opened in 1980.Our History . Stella Maris. Retrieved 2010-08-25 All these services have since been absorbed by other lines or otherwise abolished. In 1982, Route 8 was split into two separate lines in order to provide improved schedule adherence on each line and varied frequencies of service along each corridor, where demands for service varied. The new Route 8 ran from the center of Towson to the University of Maryland Transit Center, and the new Route 2 from Catonsville to City Hall. Service along Route 2 is currently provided by Route 10. In 1992, in conjunction with the opening of the Central Light Rail line, Route 8 was extended north of Towson to the Lutherville Light Rail Stop on Ridgely Road except on Sundays.MTA June 1992 schedule changes This extension mostly overlapped with Route 9, and this duplication of service during off-peak hours was criticized as costly. Branches to the Towson State campus and Stella Maris, though originally proposed for elimination, continued to operate at this time. In 1993, MTA, addressing the cost issue of the extension, eliminated Route 9 service between Towson and Lutherville during off-peak weekday hours, and improved the frequency of that line's service on other parts of the route. The Lutherville extension on Saturdays was also discontinued, and on weekends, improved levels of this service were provided on Route 9.MTA January 1993 schedule changes In 2000, MTA combined Routes 8 and 9, and extended selected Route 8 trips from Lutherville to Hunt Valley. This constituted about two-thirds of trips at most times. This consolidation saved costs and allowed single-seat service along the York Road corridor at all times, while making Route 8 one of the longest routes operated by MTA. Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative changes In 2005, as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, a comprehensive overhaul of the region's bus service, MTA announced that Routes 8 and 9 would once again be split into two separate lines. This time, all Route 8 trips would operate to/from Lutherville seven days a week, and Route 9 would provide all service on the route north of Ridgely Road. In addition, all other branches on the line would be eliminated. These included those to Loveton, International Circle (both former branches of Route 9), and Stella Maris. And in order to reduce overcrowding of buses, MTA stated that articulated buses, which have a higher seating capacity, would be used on all Route 8 trips. Service is no longer provided to Loveton by MTA, but a private contractor was chartered by employers in the area to provide shuttle service. In February 2006, all Route 9 were rerouted to International Circle due to complaints about the elimination of this branch.MTA announces winter schedule improvements.

Tarsney Act One of Tarsney's most long-lasting contributions was the Tarsney Act, which permitted private architects to design federal buildings after being selected in a competition under the supervision of the Supervising Architect of the United States Treasury. Competitions were held for the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, Ellis Island, James Farley Post Office, Cleveland Federal Building, U.S. Post Office and Courthouse in Baltimore, Maryland, and U.S. Customhouse in San Francisco, California (which are all now on the National Register of Historic Places) among others.

Brook's original 1985 stage play was 9 hours long, and toured around the world for four years. In 1989, it was reduced to under 6 hours for television (TV mini series). Later it was also reduced to about 3 hours for theatrical and DVD release. The screenplay was the result of eight years' work by Peter Brook, Jean-Claude Carri√®re and Marie-H√©l√®ne Estienne. Plot In general terms, the story involves epic incidents between two warring families, the Pandavas (representing the good side) and the Kauravas (representing the evil side). Both sides, being the offspring of kings and gods, fight for dominion. They have both been advised by the god Krishna to live in harmony and abstain from the bloody lust for power. Yet their fights come to threaten the very order of the Universe. The plot is framed by a dialogue between the Brahmin sage Vyasa and the Hindu deity Ganesha, and directed towards an unnamed Indian boy who comes to him inquiring about the story of the human race.

Prior to 1947, the responsibility for military aviation was divided between the Army for land- based operations and the Navy and Marine Corps for sea-based operations from aircraft carrier and amphibious aircraft. The Army created the first antecedent of the Air Force on 1 August 1907, which through a succession of changes of organization, titles, and missions advanced toward eventual separation 40 years later. The predecessor organizations leading up to today's U.S. Air Force are: * Aeronautical Division, Signal Corps (1 August 1907 ‚Äì 18 July 1914) * Aviation Section, Signal Corps (18 July 1914 ‚Äì 20 May 1918) * Division of Military Aeronautics (20 May 1918 ‚Äì 24 May 1918) * Air Service, U.S. Army (24 May 1918 ‚Äì 2 July 1926) * U.S. Army Air Corps (2 July 1926 ‚Äì 20 June 1941)* * U.S. Army Air Forces (20 June 1941 ‚Äì 17 September 1947)** * The Air Corps became a subordinate element of the Army Air Forces on 20 June 1941, and was abolished as an administrative organization on 9 March 1942. It continued to exist as a branch of the Army (similar to the infantry, quartermaster, or artillery) until reorganization provisions of the National Security Act of 1947 (61 Stat. 495), 26 July 1947. **The Army Air Forces were abolished by Transfer Order 1, Office of the Secretary of Defense, 26 September 1947, implementing the same provisions. Transfer Order 1 was the first of 200 Army-Air Force transfer agreements drawn up in June and July 1947, and ordered the transfer of all military and civilian personnel of the Army Air Forces to the Department of the Air Force and the USAF. The final transfer order was signed 22 June 1949. World War I and between wars U.S. aircraft cockade, or roundel, of late World War I =World War I= In 1917, upon the United States' entry into World War I, the first major U.S. aviation combat force was created when an Air Service was formed as part of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF). Major General Mason Patrick commanded the Air Service of the AEF; his deputy was Brigadier General Billy Mitchell. These aviation units, some of which were trained in France, provided tactical support for the U.S. Army, especially during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne offensives. Among the aces of the AEF Air Service were Captain Eddie Rickenbacker and 2nd Lieutenant Frank Luke. Concurrent with the creation of this combat force, the U.S. Army's aviation establishment in the United States was removed from control of the Signal Corps and placed directly under the United States Secretary of War. An assistant secretary was created to direct the Army Air Service, which had dual responsibilities for development and procurement of aircraft, and raising and training of air units. With the end of the First World War, the AEF's Air Service was dissolved and the Army Air Service in the United States largely demobilized. In 1920, the Air Service became a branch of the Army and in 1926 was renamed the Army Air Corps. During this period, the Air Corps began experimenting with new techniques, including air-to-air refueling and the development of the B-9 and the Martin B-10, the first all-metal monoplane bombers, and new fighters. =Billy Mitchell: Air power court martialed= Americans were fascinated with aviation in the 1920s and 1930s and refused to allow War Department conservatism to block innovation. General Billy Mitchell, the deputy director of the Air Service sought to wrest control of coastal defense away from the Navy. He went public insisting that his planes could sink battleships any day, a claim proven with a series of tests that culminated in the sinking of the Ostfriesland. Mitchell lost his self-control in 1925 when he accused the Navy in a press release of \\"incompetency, criminal negligence and almost treasonable administration of the national defense.\\" He received the highly publicized court martial he wanted, and was allowed to expound his theory that air power alone would suffice to win the next big war. He was convicted, and resigned. He became a popular hero and public opinion forced the War Department to strengthen the Air Corps. Mitchell's main argument was air power had to be autonomous‚Äîhad to be controlled by fliers who understood the new technology, new tactics, new strategies, and who would not waste precious air assets in trying to assist old-fashioned armies and navies. Until his death in 1936 Mitchell, as a civilian, was a tireless prophet of airpower before numerous civilian audiences, but he lost touch with aviation developments and ceased to be influential inside the services. Indeed, his almost hysterical attacks made many generals hostile. The Air Corps managed a few publicity stunts, but always seemed to be overshadowed by glamorous civilians like Charles Lindbergh, Howard Hughes or Amelia Earhart. In 1934 President Franklin Roosevelt, feuding with the airline industry, suddenly turned the delivery of air mail over to the Air Corps. Multiple crashes by inexperienced Air Corps pilots in mediocre planes with poor navigation gear emphasized the fragility of the new service, and undercut its claims that in wartime it could perform miracles. Roosevelt, however, had become a firm believer in air power and had behind him both public opinion and Congress. When mobilization began in spring 1940 Roosevelt was as energetic as anyone in expanding the Air Corps role, calling for 50,000 planes a year, and sending the best new models to Britain for its war against the Luftwaffe. =Command structure= In 1935, as a result of recommendations from two civilian review boards, the next advancement toward independence for the Air Force occurred when all flying units, which heretofore had been distributed to various ground commands, were grouped together as an aerial task force under one air commander as the General Headquarters Air Force. The Air Corps, headed by the Chief of the Air Corps, continued as before but now held responsibility only for supply, airfields, and training, in effect splitting the Air Force into two parts. Both were commanded by major generals (Frank Andrews and Oscar Westover, followed by Henry H. (\\"Hap\\") Arnold). =Technology= In 1937, the B-17 Flying Fortress made its first appearance. In a feat of navigation impressive for the time, three B-17s intercepted the Italian passenger liner Rex at sea. Though intended to demonstrate the ability of the Air Corps to defend the nation's coasts, the mission also indicated the emerging doctrine within the Air Corps of the supremacy of strategic bombing. During World War I, aviation technology developed rapidly; however, the Army's reluctance to use the new technology began to make airmen think that as long as the Army controlled aviation, development would be stunted and a potentially valuable force neglected. Air Service senior officer Billy Mitchell began to campaign for an independent Air Force, co-equal to the Army and Navy. But his campaign offended many and resulted in a court martial in 1925 that effectively ended his career. His followers, including future aviation leaders \\"Hap\\" Arnold and Carl Spaatz, saw the lack of public, congressional, and military support that Mitchell received and decided that America was not ready for an independent air force. Under the leadership of its chief of staff Mason Patrick and, later, Arnold, the Air Corps waited until the time to fight for independence arose again. World War II U.S. aircraft roundel primarily of the interwar years to early World War II 1943 USAAF raid on ball-bearing works at Schweinfurt, Germany. The Air Force came of age in World War II. President Franklin D. Roosevelt took the lead, calling for a vastly enlarged air force based on long-range strategic bombing. Organizationally it became largely independent from the Army in 1941, when the Army Air Corps became a part of the new U.S. Army Air Forces (AAF), and the GHQ Air Force was redesignated the subordinate Combat Command. In the major reorganization of the Army by War Department Circular 59, effective March 9, 1942, the newly created Army Air Forces gained equal voice with the Army and Navy on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and complete autonomy from the Army Ground Forces and the Services of Supply, serving as a separate service in all but name. The reorganization also eliminated both Combat Command and the Air Corps as organizations (the latter remained a combat branch of the Army until 1947) in favor of a streamlined system of commands and numbered air forces for decentralized management of the burgeoning Army Air Forces. The reorganization merged all aviation elements of the former Air Corps into the Army Air Forces. Although the Air Corps still legally existed as an Army branch, the position and Office of the Chief of the Air Corps was dissolved. Major General Carl A. Spaatz took command of the Eighth Air Force in London in 1942; with Brigadier General Ira Eaker as second in command, he supervised the strategic bombing campaign. In late 1943, Spaatz was made commander of the new U.S. Strategic Air Forces, reporting directly to the Combined Chiefs of Staff. Spaatz began daylight bombing operations using the prewar doctrine of flying bombers in close formations, relying on their combined defensive firepower for protection from attacking enemy aircraft rather than supporting fighter escorts. The doctrine proved flawed when deep- penetration missions beyond the range of escort fighters were attempted, because German fighter planes overwhelmed U.S. formations, shooting down bombers in excess of \\"acceptable\\" loss rates, especially in combination with the vast number of flak anti-aircraft batteries defending Germany's major targets. American fliers took heavy casualties during raids on the oil refineries of Ploie»ôti, Romania, and the ball-bearing factories at Schweinfurt and Regensburg, Germany, and it was the loss rate in crews and not materiel that brought about a pullback from the strategic offensive in the autumn of 1943. The Eighth Air Force had attempted to use both the P-47 and P-38 as escorts, but while the Thunderbolt was a capable dog-fighter it lacked the range, even with the addition of drop tanks to extend its range, and the Lightning proved mechanically unreliable in the frigid altitudes at which the missions were fought. Bomber protection was greatly improved after the introduction of North American P-51 Mustang fighters in Europe. With its built-in extended range and competitive or superior performance characteristics in comparison to all existing German piston-engined fighters, the Mustang was an immediately available solution to the crisis. In January 1944 the Eighth Air Force obtained priority in equipping its groups, so that ultimately 14 of its 15 groups fielded Mustangs. P-51 escorts began operations in February 1944 and increased their numbers rapidly, so that the Luftwaffe suffered increasing fighter losses in aerial engagements beginning with Big Week in early 1944. Allied fighters were also granted free rein in attacking German fighter airfields, both in pre-planned missions and while returning to base from escort duties, and the major Luftwaffe threat against Allied bombers was severely diminished by D-Day. In the Pacific Theater of Operations, the AAF provided major tactical support under General George Kenney to Douglas MacArthur in the Southwest Pacific theater. Kenney's pilots invented the skip- bombing technique against Japanese ships. Kenney's forces claimed destruction of 11,900 Japanese planes and 1.7 million tons of shipping. The first development and sustained implementation of airlift by American air forces occurred between May 1942 and November 1945 as hundreds of transports flew more than half a million tons of supplies from India to China over the Hump. The AAF created the Twentieth Air Force to employ long-range B-29 Superfortress bombers in strategic attacks on Japanese cities. The use of forward bases in China (needed to be able to reach Japan by the heavily laden B-29's) was ineffective because of the difficulty in logistically supporting the bases entirely by air from its main bases in India, and because of a persistent threat against the Chinese airfields by the Japanese army. After the Mariana Islands were captured in mid-1944, providing locations for air bases that could be supplied by sea, Arnold moved all B-29 operations there by April 1945 and made General Curtis LeMay his bomber commander (reporting directly to Arnold, who personally commanded Twentieth Air Force until July). LeMay reasoned that the Japanese economy, much of which was cottage industry in dense urban areas where manufacturing and assembly plants were also located, was particularly vulnerable to area attack and abandoned inefficient high-altitude precision bombing in favor of low-level incendiary bombings aimed at destroying large urban areas. On the night of March 9‚Äì10, 1945, the bombing of Tokyo and the resulting conflagration resulted in the death of over 100,000 persons. 350,000 people died in 66 other Japanese cities as a result of this shift to incendiary bombing. At the same time, the B-29 was also employed in widespread mining of Japanese harbors and sea lanes. In early August 1945, the Twentieth Air Force conducted atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in response to Japan's rejection of the Potsdam Declaration which outlined the terms of surrender for Japan. Both cities were destroyed with enormous loss of life and psychological shock. On August 15, Emperor Hirohito announced the surrender of Japan, stating: Cold War and war in Korea Special photo of Air Force bombers from the 1930s through the late 1940s.

In practice, the Army Air Forces became virtually independent of the Army during World War II, but its leaders wanted formal independence. In November 1945, General Dwight D. Eisenhower became Army Chief of Staff, while General Carl Spaatz began to assume the duties of Commanding General, Army Air Forces, in anticipation of General Arnold's announced retirement. One of General Eisenhower's first actions was to appoint a board of officers, headed by Lieutenant General William H. Simpson, to prepare a definitive plan for the reorganization of the Army and the Air Force that could be effected without enabling legislation and would provide for the separation of the Air Force from the Army. On 29 January 1946 \\"Generals Eisenhower and Spaatz agreed on an Air Force organization composed of Strategic Air Command, Air Defense Command, Tactical Air Command, Air Transport Command, Air Technical Service Command, Air Training Command, the Air University, and the Air Force Center.\\" Over the continuing objections of the Navy, which feared losing its air arm and strategic role to the new service, the United States Department of the Air Force was created by the National Security Act of 1947. That act became effective 18 September 1947 when the first secretary of the Air Force, Stuart Symington, took office. In 1948, the service chiefs agreed on usage of air assets under the Key West Agreement. \\"In 1947 President Truman signed the National Security Act which established this new defense organization, and along with it the creation of the US Air Force as an independent service, equal to the US Army and US Navy. The official birthday of the US Air Force is 18 September 1947.\\" On 18 September 1947, the Army Air Forces became the United States Air Force as a separate and equal element of the United States Armed Forces. The fledgling Air Force quickly established its own identity. Army Air Fields were renamed Air Force Bases and personnel were soon being issued new uniforms with new rank insignia. Once the new Air Force was free of army domination, its first job was to discard the old and inadequate ground army organizational structure. This was the \\"Base Plan\\" where the combat group commander reported to the base commander, who was often regular army, with no flying experience. General Carl A. Spaatz established a new policy, \\"No tactical commander should be subordinate to the station commander\\". This resulted in a search for a better arrangement. The commander of the 15th Air Force, Major General Charles Born, proposed the Provisional Wing Plan, which basically reversed the situation and put the wing commander over the base commander. The USAF basic organizational unit became the Base-Wing. Under this plan, the base support functions ‚Äì supply, base operations, transportation, security, and medical were assigned to squadrons, usually commanded by a Major or Lieutenant Colonel. All of these squadrons were assigned to a Combat Support Group, commanded by a Base Commander, usually a Colonel. Combat fighter or bomber squadrons were assigned to the Combat Group, a retention of the USAAF Group. All of these groups, both combat and combat support, were in turn assigned to the Wing, commanded by a Wing Commander. This way the Wing Commander commanded both the combat operational elements on the base as well as the non-operational elements. The Wing Commander was an experienced air combat leader, usually a Colonel or Brigadier General. All of the hierarchical organizations carried the same numerical designation. In this manner, for example, the 28th became the designation for the Wing and all the subordinate groups and squadrons beneath it. As a result, the base and the wing became one and the same unit. On 16 June 1952, the legacy combat groups were inactivated and the operational Combat Squadrons were assigned directly to the Wing. The World War II history, lineage and honors of the combat group were bestowed on the Wing upon its inactivation. The USAAF Wing then was redesignated as an Air Division, which was commanded Brigadier General or higher, who commanded two or more wings usually, but not always, on a single base. Numbered Air Forces (NAF) commanded both Air Divisions or Wings directly, and the NAF was under the Major Command (SAC, TAC, ADC, etc.). After World War II, relations between the United States and the Soviet Union began to deteriorate, and the period in history known as the Cold War began. The United States entered an arms race with the Soviet Union and competition aimed at increasing each nation's influence throughout the world. In response, the United States expanded its military presence throughout the world. The USAF opened air bases throughout Europe, and later in Japan and South Korea. The United States also built air bases on the British overseas territories of British Indian Ocean Territory and Ascension Island in the South Atlantic. The first test for the USAF during the Cold War came in 1948, when Communist authorities in East Germany cut and air transportation to West Berlin. The USAF, along with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Commonwealth air forces, supplied the city during the Berlin airlift under Operation Vittles, using C-54 Skymasters. The efforts of these air forces saved the city from starvation and forced the Soviets to back down in their blockade. Conflict over post-war military administration, especially with regard to the roles and missions to be assigned to the Air Force and the U.S. Navy, led to an episode called the \\"Revolt of the Admirals\\" in the late 1940s, in which high-ranking Navy officers argued unsuccessfully for the case for carrier-based aircraft rather than strategic bombers. In 1947, the USAF began Project Sign, a study of unidentified flying objects what would be twice revived (first as Project Grudge and finally as Project Blue Book) and which would last until 1969.Unidentified Flying Objects and Air Force Project Blue Book (USAF Fact Sheet 95-03 , updated October, 2005); URL retrieved 25 June 2007 In 1948 the Women's Armed Services Integration Act gave women permanent status in the Regular and Reserve forces of the Air Force. On 8 July 1948, Esther McGowin Blake became the first woman in the Air Force, enlisting the first minute of the first hour of the first day regular Air Force duty was authorized for women.Women of the U.S. Air Force: Aiming High By Heather E. Schwartz, p.14 During the Korean War, which began in June 1950, the Far East Air Forces (FEAF) were among the first units to respond to the invasion by North Korea, but quickly lost its main airbase at Kimpo, South Korea. Designated to provide close air support to the defenders of the Pusan pocket from bases in Japan, the FEAF also conducted a strategic bombing campaign against North Korea's war-making potential simultaneously. General Douglas MacArthur's landing at Inchon in September 1950 enabled the FEAF to return to Korea and develop bases from which they supported MacArthur's drive to the Korean-Chinese border. When the Chinese People's Liberation Army attacked in December 1950, the USAF provided tactical air support. The introduction of Soviet-made MiG-15 jet fighters caused problems for the B-29s used to bomb North Korea, but the USAF countered the MiGs with its new F-86 Sabre jet fighters. Although both air superiority and close air support missions were successful, a lengthy attempt to interdict communist supply lines by air attack was not as successful and was replaced by a systematic campaign to inflict as much economic cost to North Korea and the Chinese forces as long as war persisted, including attacks on the capital city of Pyongyang and against the North Korean hydroelectric system. Vietnam War A U.S. B-66 Destroyer and four F-105 Thunderchiefs dropping bombs on North Vietnam in 1966 The USAF was heavily deployed during the Vietnam War. The first bombing raids against North Vietnam occurred in 1964, following the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. In March 1965, a sustained bombing campaign began, code-named Operation Rolling Thunder. This campaign's purpose was to destroy the will of the North Vietnamese to fight, destroy industrial bases and air defenses, and to stop the flow of men and supplies down the Ho Chi Minh Trail, while forcing North Vietnam into peace negotiations. The USAF dropped more bombs in all combat operations in Vietnam during the period 1965‚Äì68 than it did during World War II,DoD release January 1968, cited in CIA estimate of damage to North Vietnam infrastructure and the Rolling Thunder campaign lasted until the U.S. presidential election of 1968. Except for heavily damaging the North Vietnamese economy and infrastructure, Rolling Thunder failed in its political and strategic goals. The USAF also played a critical role in defeating the Easter Offensive of 1972. The rapid redeployment of fighters, bombers, and attack aircraft help the South Vietnamese Army repel the invasion. Operation Linebacker demonstrated to both the North and South Vietnamese that even without significant U.S. Army ground forces, the United States could still influence the war. The air war for the United States ended with Operation Linebacker II, also known as the \\"Christmas Bombings.\\" These helped to finalize the Paris peace negotiations. The insurgent nature of combat operations early in the war, and the necessity of interdicting the North Vietnamese regular army and its supply lines in third-party countries of Southeast Asia led to the development of a significant special operations capability within the USAF. Provisional and experimental concepts such as air commandos and aerial gunships, tactical missions such as the partially successful Operation Ivory Coast deep inside enemy territory, and a dedicated Combat Search and Rescue mission resulted in development of operational doctrines, units, and equipment. Combat operations since 1975 The USAF modernized its tactical air forces in the late 1970s with the introduction of the F-15, A-10, and F-16 fighters, and the implementation of realistic training scenarios under the aegis of Red Flag. In turn, it also upgraded the equipment and capabilities of its Air Reserve Components (ARC) by the equipping of both the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve with first-line aircraft. Expanding its force structure in the 1980s to 40 fighter wings and drawing further on the lessons of the Vietnam War, the USAF also dedicated units and aircraft to Electronic Warfare (EW) and the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD). The humiliating failure in April 1980 of the Operation Eagle Claw rescue mission in Iran resulted directly in an increased USAF emphasis on participation in the doctrine, equipment, personnel, and planning of Joint Special Operations. The USAF provided attack, airlift, and combat support capability for operations in Grenada in 1983 (Operation Urgent Fury), Libya in 1986 (Operation El Dorado Canyon), and Panama in 1989 (Operation Just Cause). Lessons learned in these operations were applied to its force structure and doctrine, and became the basis for successful air operations in the 1990s and after September 11, 2001. The development of satellite reconnaissance during the Cold War, the extensive use of both tactical and strategic aerial reconnaissance during numerous combat operations, and the nuclear war deterrent role of the USAF resulted in the recognition of space as a possible combat arena. An emphasis on \\"aerospace\\" operations and doctrine grew in the 1980s. Missile warning and space operations were combined to form Air Force Space Command in 1982. In 1991, Operation Desert Storm provided emphasis for the command's new focus on supporting combat operations. The creation of the internet and the universality of computer technology as a basic warfighting tool resulted in the priority development of cyber warfare techniques and defenses by the USAF. =Gulf War= The USAF provided the bulk of the Coalition air power during the Gulf War in 1991, flying alongside aircraft of the U.S. Navy. The F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter's capabilities were shown on the first night of the air war when it was able to bomb central Baghdad and avoid the sophisticated Iraqi anti-aircraft defenses. The USAF, along with the U.S. Navy, later patrolled the skies of northern and southern Iraq after the war to ensure that Iraq's air defense capability could not be rebuilt: Operation Provide Comfort 1991‚Äì96 and Operation Northern Watch 1997‚Äì2003 ‚Äì no- fly zones north of the 36th parallel north and Operation Southern Watch ‚Äì no- fly zone south of the 33rd parallel north. In 1996, Operation Desert Strike and 1998 Operation Desert Fox, the USAF bombed military and chemical targets in Iraq. =Bosnia and Kosovo= The USAF led NATO action in Bosnia with no- fly zones (Operation Deny Flight) 1993‚Äì96 and in 1995 with air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs (Operation Deliberate Force). This was the first time that USAF aircraft took part in military action as part of a NATO mission. The USAF led the strike forces as the NATO Air Force (otherwise mainly composed of RAF and Luftwaffe aircraft) with the greatest capability to launch air strikes over a long period of time. In 1999, the USAF led NATO air strikes against Serbia during the Kosovo War (Operation Allied Force). =Global War on Terror= Aircraft of the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing and coalition counterparts stationed together at Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar, in southwest Asia, fly over the desert. April 14, 2003. Aircraft include KC-135 Stratotanker, F-15E Strike Eagle, F-117 Nighthawk, F-16CJ Falcon, British Tornado GR4, and Australian F/A-18 Hornet. In 2001, the USAF was deployed against the Taliban forces in Afghanistan. Operating from Diego Garcia, B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bombers attacked Taliban positions. The USAF deployed daisy cutter bombs, dropped from C-130 Hercules cargo planes, for the first time since the Vietnam War. During this conflict, the USAF opened up bases in Central Asia for the first time. The USAF was deployed in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Following the defeat of Saddam Hussein's regime, the USAF took over Baghdad International Airport as a base. USAF aircraft are used to provide support to Coalition and Iraqi forces in major operations to eliminate insurgent centers of activity and supply in north and west Iraq. Operations in both Afghanistan and Iraq demonstrated the effective utility of Unmanned air vehicles, the most prominent of which was the MQ-1 Predator. Fifty-four USAF personnel died in the Iraq War.Hampson, Rick, \\"West Point's Quiet Place Of Honor, Lost Dreams\\", USA Today, 28 December 2011, p. 1.

Protests were inspired by the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt. In the summer of 2014 President Obama announced the return of US Forces to Iraq. The US Air Force is undertaking a significant humanitarian effort in order to assist Iraq's imperiled minority groups. When permission was later granted for USAF airstrikes, it was on condition that the types of aircraft not be announced so as to obscure which countries they were based in. 2010s F-22A and F-35A over Florida's Emerald Coast Today, the United States Air Force is the largest, most capable, and most technologically advanced air force in the world, with about 5,778 manned aircraft in service, approximately 156 Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles, 2,130 Air-Launched Cruise Missiles, and 450 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The USAF has 328,439 personnel on active duty, 74,000 in the Selected and Individual Ready Reserves, and 106,000 in the Air National Guard. In addition, the Air Force employs 168,900 civilian personnel including indirect hire of foreign nationals. However, after two decades of failure to recapitalize its aircraft under Clinton and the two Bushes, the USAF has its oldest and most outdated fleet ever. Tactical aircraft purchases were put off while Fifth-generation jet fighters were facing delays, cost overruns and cutbacks and the programs to replace the 1950s bomber and tanker fleets have just been started over again after many aborted attempts.Talmadge, Eric. \\"US Air Force struggles with aging fleet.\\" Huff Post, 4 November 2012.

The plane was spotted late 13 March 2008. Rescuers could reach the site only by helicopter and arrived at daybreak 15 March 2008. There have been 17 other crashes of Luke Air Force Base F-16s since 1998, and only one of those resulted in a fatality. That crash happened in May 2004, when a pilot with the Republic of Singapore Air Force died after his jet went down during a training mission at an Air Force bombing range in southwest Arizona. The most recent crashes came in 2006. A pilot ejected safely from an F-16 in April 2006 after the lone engine on the jet exploded just after takeoff from the base. The aircraft came down in a cornfield.Pilot killed in F-16 combat training, March 16, 2008 On 5 June 2008 Robert Gates announced the results of an investigation into the misshipment of four MK-12 forward-section reentry vehicle assemblies to Taiwan. The investigation, conducted by Admiral Kirkland H. Donald, director of the US Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program, found that the Taiwan missile incident was, in Gates' words, \\"A degradation of the authority, standards of excellence and technical competence within the nation's ICBM force. Similar to the bomber-specific August 2007 Minot-Barksdale nuclear weapons transfer incident, this incident took place within the larger environment of declining Air Force nuclear mission focus and performance\\" and that \\"the investigation identified commonalities between the August 2007 Minot incident and this [the Taiwan] event.\\" In his investigation report, Donald stated that the issues identified by his investigation were, \\"Indicative of an overall decline in Air Force nuclear weapons stewardship, a problem that has been identified but not effectively addressed for over a decade. Both the Minot-Barksdale nuclear weapons transfer incident and the Taiwan misshipment, while different in specifics, have a common origin: the gradual erosion of nuclear standards and a lack of effective oversight by Air Force leadership\\"US DoD, \\"DoD News Briefing with Secretary Gates from the Pentagon\\", Military Times, \\"Moseley and Wynne forced out\\", Shanker, \\"2 Leaders Ousted From Air Force in Atomic Errors\\". As a result of the investigation, Gates announced that, \\"A substantial number of Air Force general officers and colonels have been identified as potentially subject to disciplinary measures, ranging from removal from command to letters of reprimand,\\" and that he had accepted the resignations of USAF Secretary Michael Wynne and USAF Chief of Staff Michael Moseley. Gates added that he had asked James R. Schlesinger to lead a senior- level task force to recommend improvements in the stewardship and operation of nuclear weapons, delivery vehicles and sensitive components by the US DoD. Members of the task force came from the Defense Policy Board and the Defense Science Board.US DoD, \\"DoD News Briefing with Secretary Gates from the Pentagon\\", June 5, 2008, Military Times, \\"Moseley and Wynne forced out\\", Shanker, \\"2 Leaders Ousted From Air Force in Atomic Errors\\".

In 2012 the USAF received push back from the Congress over a plan to retire multiple reserve squadrons, leading to the formation of the National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force to resolve the proper balance between active and reserve air forces.\\"USAF Commission Struggling With Cost Figures.\\" This was followed in 2013 by the Total Force Task Force in an attempt to handle budget disagreements between the active and reserve forces. In 2014, the USAF's 30 year strategy document cited a need for both low end and high end capabilities, and so called for cuts in high demand UAVs in favor of retaining \\"outdated fighter aircraft that would not be survivable in a high end conflict\\".

TFIIH first came to light in 1989 when general transcription factor-Œ¥ or basic transcription factor 2 was characterized as an indispensable transcription factor in vitro. This factor was also isolated from yeast and finally named as TFIIH in 1992. TFIIH consists of ten subunits, 7 of which (ERCC2/XPD, ERCC3/XPB, GTF2H1/p62, GTF2H4/p52, GTF2H2/p44, GTF2H3/p34 and GTF2H5/TTDA) form the core complex. The cyclin activating kinase-subcomplex (CDK7, MAT1, and cyclin H) is linked to the core via the XPD protein. Two of the subunits, ERCC2/XPD and ERCC3/XPB, have helicase and ATPase activities and help create the transcription bubble. In a test tube these subunits are only required for transcription if the DNA template is not already denatured or if it is supercoiled. Two other TFIIH subunits, CDK7 and cyclin H, phosphorylate serine amino acids on the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain and possibly other proteins involved in the cell cycle. Next to a vital function in transcription initiation, TFIIH is also involved in nucleotide excision repair.  History of TFIIH  Before TFIIH identified it, it had several names : this factor first in 1989 isolated from liver of rat known that time as factor transcription delta it also, isolated from cancer cell known that time as Basic transcription factor 2, Also, it is isolated from yeast known transcription factor B. Finally, in 1992 known as TFIIH.  Structure of TFIIH  The TFIIH consists of two main pieces the core with is the core XPB has these subunits p62, p52, p44, p34 and p8 and CAK composed of CDK7, cyclin H and MAT1. The unit that joins the core to the CAK is called XPD.  Functions  General function of TFIIH: # Initiation transcription of protein- coding gene. # DNA nucleotide repairing. (NER)TFIIH is a general transcription factor that acts to recruit RNA Pol II to the promoters of genes. It functions as a helicase that unwinds DNA. It also unwinds DNA after a DNA lesion has been recognized by either the global genome repair (GGR) pathway or the transcription-coupled repair (TCR) pathway of NER. Also, the purified TFIIH has role in making RNA by activating enzyme a-amanitin.  Trichothiodystrophy  Mutation in genes ERCC3/XPB, ERCC2/XPD or TTDA cause trichothiodystrophy, a condition characterized by photosensitivity, ichthyosis, brittle hair and nails, intellectual impairment, decreased fertility and/or short stature.  Disease  Genetic polymorphisms of genes that encode subunits of TFIIH are known to be associated with increased cancer susceptibility in many tissues, e.g.; skin tissue, breast tissue and lung tissue. Mutations in the subunits (such as XPD and XPB) can lead to a variety of diseases, including xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) or XP combined with Cockayne syndrome. In addition to genetic variations, virus-encoded proteins also target TFIIH. DNA repair TFIIH participates in nucleotide excision repair (NER) by opening the DNA double helix after damage is initially recognized. NER is a multi-step pathway that removes a wide range of different damages that distort normal base pairing, including bulky chemical damages and UV-induced damages. Individuals with mutational defects in genes specifying protein components that catalyze the NER pathway, including the TFIIH components, often display features of premature aging (see DNA damage theory of aging).

In both cases it generally provides an independent view of the program status to the program board or executive. For smaller programs program assurance may be undertaken from within the program or report into a portfolio office. The key difference between program assurance and program quality management or audit, is that program assurance tends to look at the potential impact of the program's approach. Assurance may either focus on program delivery, program solutions or both may have equal weight. Within major IT programs external assurance often focuses on program delivery and would concentrate on program plans and capability. Where assurance also covers the solution this would include the business processes, systems, infrastructure, service and hosting. Solution may also cover the approach to design, delivery and implementation. Program assurance tends to cover three separate styles of assurance: Continuous assurance throughout the life of the program; Point reviews or periodic reviews; focused reviews that concentrate on a particular aspect of a program. For very large programs all three would be undertaken with continuous assurance reporting to the program board on a regular basis, and point or focused reviews being undertaken at strategic points.

Woollen Gymnasium (commonly known as the Woollen Gymnasium or Woollen) was the home of North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team from January 2, 1939, through February 27, 1965, across twenty-six seasons. Due to increased demand for viewing the varsity basketball team and limited capacity at then home court the Tin Can, school president Frank Porter Graham and Charles T. Woollen requested public funds for a new gymnasium and women's dormitory. After being rejected at the federal level, the North Carolina Public Works would award a grant of $283,090 to build a new gymnasium and the school would have to fundraise to cover the cost's remainder. The plans for the building included multi‚Äìlevel building that included an attached swimming pool, along with a main lobby that would overlook the main gymnasium area. Aside from varsity basketball, the building was used for physical education classes, recreational activity for students, and office spaces. Construction stretched from 1937 to 1938 and, upon completion, was seen as \\"modern\\" and one of the highest‚Äìquality basketball facilities in the Atlantic Coast Conference. The gym was first used competitively for intramural fencing in the spring of 1938. The Tar Heels had great success in the building, winning several conference championships and even winning the national championship to culminate a perfect season in 1956‚Äì57. As the Tar Heels increased in popularity and demand increased, Woollen began to be viewed as small. The university began moving some of its home games to Charlotte or Greensboro to allow for more to attend and bring in more revenue. The Tar Heels left for Carmichael Auditorium before the start of the 1965‚Äì66 season, an auditorium that was built attached to Woollen as per stipulated by the funds awarded by the North Carolina legislature. After the Tar Heels' departure, the facility was frequently used for course registration, pick‚Äìup basketball, and now the Exercise and Sports Science department is based in the building. Background and construction The growth of the University of North Carolina in the 1910s and early 1920s strove the efforts to build a new facility so that more of the student body would be able to view games. Then Graduate Manager of Athletics Charles T. Woollen elected to build the Tin Can in 1923 as a temporary solution before constructing a permanent venue for the varsity team. Woollen had started collecting data in 1918 on gymnasiums and swimming pools as the Tar Heels played in their first home arena Bynum Gymnasium and through their time in the Tin Can. In 1927, an editorial in school newspaper The Daily Tar Heel wrote that \\"One of the urgent needs of the university which demands attention is the growing necessity for a new gymnasium to take care for the physical welfare of the increasing student body.\\" The Daily Tar Heel published an article each year advocating for a new gym. In the spring of 1935, school president Frank Porter Graham and Woollen sought out close to $500,000 in public funds for the building of a new gymnasium and a women's dormitory. Initial efforts failed and Woollen returned to Washington D.C. and met with President of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt; however, due to low unemployment levels in Chapel Hill the request was denied. Despite the rejection, Woollen persisted and North Carolina Public Works director Stanley H. Wright announced on October 24, 1936 that the university would receive a $283,090 grant to build the gymnasium and the rest of the required funds -- $346,000 -- would have to be raised by the school. The building plans were developed by Atwood and Weeks. Bids for the construction contracts started in January 1937 with a 30 day deadline for submission, but the deadline was extended through March 9. On March 23, Wright announced the contracts for the building of the gym: J.A. Jones Construction Company for general construction, Reliance Engineering Company for heating, and W. M. Wiggins for plumbing. The respective prices for the contracts were $415,957, $47,007, and $20,909. Details were released regarding the buildings functions and specifications including the main gymnasium structure would be (while the gym floor would be ), the swimming pool would be in a attached structure with a swimming surface of , a lobby that overlooks the gym from the second floor that houses the classrooms, offices, and fan rooms. The main gym floor gave room for two varsity basketball courts, along with courts for volleyball, intramural basketball, shuffleboard, handball, badminton, and one tennis court. The ground floor contained the locker rooms, squash and handball courts, showers, and treatment rooms. The maple hardwood would be installed over a concrete floor to cover the entire first, main floor. The backboards for the goals were glass. The building itself was built with colonial brick and trimmed with limestone. Construction was to begin within two weeks of Wright's announcements of the contract, which began with the clearing of trees on site with the goal of finishing the project by January 11, 1938. Excavations were finished in May after weather delays in April. By January 1938, construction had been delayed due for three primary reasons: around 2,000 cubic yards of blue granite had to be removed, which was more than anticipated; a delay in the steel delivery; and heavy rains in the first three months of construction prevented trucks from operating on the ground that led to nearly 20 work days lost due to rain alone. Arrangements were made for the presentation of the pool and gymnasium prior to their completion in March, for March 24 & 25; however, on the night of the 22nd, four students snuck into the gym and swam in the pool, which led the school to place Federal agents outside the facilities to monitor it until it was officially opened. The two days featured several meetings, meals at the Carolina Inn, and presentation talks from President Graham and ex‚ÄìGovernor John C. B. Ehringhaus, among others, while the building would be formally inspected on the 25th with Woollen as the honorary guide. Then physical education professor Oliver Cromwell stated that the gymnasium \\"[enabled] the University for the first time to provide some form of healthful activity for every member of the student body.\\" The swimming pool was donated by Nathalie Gray, wife of the late Bowman Gray Sr., and her two sons Bowman Jr. and Gordon in his memory. The Daily Tar Heel reported that the gym could accommodate 6,000 people with the portable grandstands placed, while Cromwell stated the maximum capacity could be 8,000. The reported capacity has varied on several accounts. The final cost for the facilities totaled to be $646,000. In early April, rumors had been spreading that the facility would be named in honor of Woollen, leading officials to deny the rumors. Graham stated his intentions to name the gymnasium and it was thought he would do so near commencement. After Graham had proposed the naming during a meeting in commencement, the venue was officially named the \\"Charles T. Woollen Gymnasium\\" by the board of trustees in September 1938. Woollen Gymnasium was viewed the \\"modern\\" gym in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) for several years after its construction. Across a four‚Äìmonth span in 1942, an $82,000 project was done to expand Woollen. The additions included increased shower space, more lockers, and a physical education area with a area. History In April 1938 , the men's and women's intramural fencing leagues finals were the first events to be held in the new gym, while days later Georgia Tech's fencing team arrived to play the first intercollegiate match in the new venue. In the fall of 1938, physical education courses started to be held in the facility. President Roosevelt spoke at Woollen before a crowd of over 6,000 people on December 5, 1938. The event was to take place at Kenan Memorial Stadium; however, due to weather it was moved to Woollen. On January 2, 1939, the Tar Heels hosted Atlantic Christian for Woollen gymnasium's first varsity basketball game, where the Tar Heels emerged victorious 57‚Äì19. As the Tar Heels succeeded under McGuire, the student ticket distribution had to be altered due to increased desire. The tickets would be allocated for those with the last names between A to M would get tickets for the first home game and those from N to Z would get the next home game and alternate in that pattern. The gymnasium soon began to be viewed as small due to increased interest and larger enrollments, capacity became a larger concern when the Tobacco Road schools played in the venue. While playing in Woollen, the Tar Heels reached two NCAA national championship games, in 1946 and 1957, emerging victorious in the latter and to cap a 32‚Äì0 season. As the Tar Heels increased in popularity, the university chose to have home games at off‚Äìcampus venues as Woollen's seating was so limited, choosing to play in Charlotte or Greensboro instead. By playing at these locations, the school would turn more profit than normal home games at Woollen since student tickets were limited for these games and the venue was larger, allowing more tickets to be sold to the masses. In the team's final season at Woollen, the Tar Heels only played seven true home games. Carolina played their final home game at Woollen on February 27, 1965 against Duke and won 71‚Äì66. North Carolina played 262 games in Woollen and finished with a record of 207‚Äì55 (.790). As of the conclusion of the 2019‚Äì20 season, Woollen has the worst home winning percentage of the five home venues for the Tar Heels. The Tar Heels went undefeated at Woollen Gymnasium in five of their twenty-six seasons at the facility: 1958‚Äì59 (6‚Äì0), 1960‚Äì61 (7‚Äì0), 1956‚Äì57 (8‚Äì0), 1968‚Äì69 (9‚Äì0), and 1955‚Äì56 (10‚Äì0). The most losses in a single season while playing in Woollen came in the 1943‚Äì44 campaign when the Tar Heels lost five games. The Tar Heels showed success in the Southern Conference while in Woollen as they won the regular season championship in 1941, 1944, and 1946, while winning their post‚Äìseason conference tournament in 1940 and 1945. After the Tar Heels moved into the ACC before the season started in 1953, the Tar Heels continued to succeed. North Carolina won the ACC regular season title in 1956, 1957, 1959, 1960, and 1961, while winning the post‚Äìseason conference tournament in 1957 and 1959. In January 1947, it was announced that due to student demand, no public tickets would be offered for the rest of the season. As early as 1948 there began to be sentiments that Woollen was too small. In 1958, after the university began to reduce the number of true home games, the student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel showed dissatisfaction with that decision and felt a new gym with a larger capacity would be needed to keep drawing strong competition. The article cited how Coach Adolph Rupp and the Kentucky Wildcats played at Duke in front of a less than capacity crowd and would not return because they made little money off the visit. In July 1962, there was a request to the North Carolina state legislature by the Consolidated University to receive funds to build an addition to Woollen Gym rather than a new $6 million coliseum as some had proposed. Construction began in May 1964 for the new Auditorium. It was hoped that the larger capacity (estimated to be 10,000) in the auditorium would allow the university to turn a profit on home games for basketball. At the time, the basketball program only made money from road trips. The new venue that shared Woollen's eastern wall, officially named Carmichael Auditorium, was finished in 1965 in time for the start of the 1965‚Äì66 season. . =After the Tar Heels' departure= For a period of time after the Tar Heels moved to Carmichael, the building was used for class registration before the advent of online registering. The venue contains eight full basketball courts, which led it to become a place where students frequent to play pick-up basketball despite newer courts opening up on campus. In addition, it has hosted intramural basketball leagues over the years. The Exercise and Sports Science department is based in Woollen. In May 2004, Woollen was closed to have the original gym floor replaced with a new 35,000 sq. foot floor, along with the infrastructure and classroom renovations, as part of a five-month renovation occurred because a bond of $516,500 was given to the university for the renovations. The floor was subsequently donated to a local Habitat for Humanity and all the proceeds from its sale benefited the organization. The gym was officially reopened on October 6, 2004 with a ceremony that featured several former Tar Heels who played in the venue. When the gym was closed again for more renovations starting in the summer of 2009, there was a notable increase in wait time at Rams Head gym's basketball courts. The renovations were completed in time for the start of the spring 2012 semester. The renovations, which costed around $5.2 million, included two new dance studios and piping replacement, among other additions. As of 2014, the courts still attracted over 150 people per day.

Formerly known as the Southport Ditch Cemetery, it occupies a small area of land just to the south of the city walls, in what had been a defensive ditch during the period of Spanish rule of Gibraltar. Although it is named for the Battle of Trafalgar of 21 October 1805, only two victims of the battle are buried there. The remainder of the interments are mostly of those killed in other sea battles or casualties of the yellow fever epidemics that swept Gibraltar between 1804 and 1814. In addition, tombstones were transferred to the Trafalgar Cemetery from St. Jago's Cemetery and Alameda Gardens. Trafalgar Cemetery The cemetery is no longer used for burials and was abandoned for many years, but was restored in the 1980s. In 1992, a memorial to the Battle of Trafalgar was erected in the cemetery. The graveyard is the site of an annual commemorative ceremony on Trafalgar Day, the Sunday nearest to the anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar. Trafalgar Cemetery is listed with the Gibraltar Heritage Trust. Location The Trafalgar Cemetery is in Gibraltar, the British Overseas Territory at the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a triangular parcel of land whose boundaries are formed by the Charles V Wall to the north, Prince Edward's Road to the east, and Trafalgar Road to the southwest. Prince Edward's Gate is at the northeast corner of the cemetery; the Southport Gates are at the northwest corner. The cemetery is just outside the old city walls, in a section of the Southport Ditch, part of the southern defences of the city. The Southport Ditch was a large trench which extended on the south side of Charles V Wall from the South Bastion to the Flat Bastion. It was depicted in a 1627 map of Gibraltar by Spanish engineer Luis Bravo de Acu√±a. On the map held by the British Museum, it is labeled in Spanish as Fosso (). Early history The cemetery was formerly known as the Southport Ditch Cemetery. It was consecrated in June 1798, seven years prior to the Battle of Trafalgar, which took place on 21 October 1805. The cemetery was sometimes considered to be part of St. Jago's Cemetery, the larger burial ground just to the north, on the opposite side of Charles V Wall. St. Jago's, also known as Deadman's Cemetery, was the only cemetery within the walls of the city of Gibraltar. In addition, it may have represented Gibraltar's oldest known cemetery. It was incorporated into St. Jago's Barracks playground in 1929, and repurposed as a rifle range and \\"ball alley.\\" There exists little evidence of the former cemetery. Interments Headstone of Captain Thomas Norman of Headstone of Lieutenant William Forster of The Southport Ditch Cemetery was used for interments between 1798 and 1814, after which it fell into disuse. The only exception was the grave from 1838 at the northeast corner of the cemetery, near Prince Edward's Gate. The renaming of the graveyard to commemorate the Battle of Trafalgar apparently did not occur until many years after the victory. Only two of the interments are of those who died of wounds sustained during the battle. One of the victims was Captain Thomas Norman of the Royal Marine Corps and , who died in the Naval Hospital on 6 December 1805 at the age of 36. The other was Lieutenant William Forster of , who died of the wounds that he received in battle on 21 October 1805 at the age of 20. A plaque mounted by the Southport Gates reads: \\"Trafalgar Cemetery - Here Lie The Remains Of Some Who Died Of Wounds At Gibraltar After Nelson's Great Victory In October, 1805, Those Killed During The Battle Having Been Buried At Sea. Other Graves Date From 1798.\\" Most of those who were killed during the battle were buried at sea. , Horatio Nelson's former flagship, was towed into Rosia Bay on 28 October 1805. Later, Nelson's remains were transported to England, where he was buried in a crypt in St Paul's Cathedral. Casualties of the battle were brought to Gibraltar; those who died later of their injuries were interred in St. Jago's Cemetery, north of Charles V Wall. Many of the graves in Trafalgar Cemetery represent the victims of three yellow fever epidemics. Those epidemics in Gibraltar had been most severe during the years 1804, 1813, and 1814. Also interred at Trafalgar Cemetery were the sailors who died in other battles of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, including the First Battle of Algeciras in 1801 and conflicts off C√°diz and M√°laga in 1810 and 1812, respectively. Transfer of headstones In 1932, more than a century after the Trafalgar Cemetery fell into disuse, gravestones from St. Jago's Cemetery were mounted on the east wall of Trafalgar Cemetery. The oldest tombstone on the wall dates to 1738. The transfer of headstones was undertaken on the order of General Sir Alexander Godley, the Governor of Gibraltar. In addition, over the years, several tombstones were transferred from the Alameda Gardens; some of the free-standing gravestones date back to the 1780s. Recent history Trafalgar Day ceremony at Trafalgar Cemetery in 2008 For years, an annual ceremony has been held on Trafalgar Day, the Sunday closest to 21 October. On that day, the ceremony in the cemetery commemorates those who died in the Battle of Trafalgar. A general restoration of the Trafalgar Cemetery was undertaken in the 1980s. In 1990, responsibility for the maintenance of the cemetery was transferred to the Gibraltar Heritage Trust, which completed repairs of the gates and walls. Gibraltar celebrated its tercentenary anniversary of British rule in 2004. That year, some veterans who had served there were invited to Gibraltar. The July 2004 schedule for the veterans included events at the Trafalgar Cemetery, Gibraltar Cross of Sacrifice, Gibraltar Museum, and St. Michael's Cave. In 1992, a monument was unveiled at the cemetery by the Governor of Gibraltar, Admiral Sir Derek Reffell. The memorial included an anchor donated by the Royal Navy, as well as an inscription. The quote was that of Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, who reported both the victory at Trafalgar and the demise of Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson. Outside of the cemetery stands a life-size, bronze statue of Lord Nelson by British sculptor John Doubleday. It was erected in 2005 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar. In addition, a small plaque was mounted at the former area of St. Jago's Cemetery to commemorate the site of interment of those sailors who later died of wounds inflicted during the battle.

The Brigade administered the regular infantry regiments of East Anglia, England. After the Second World War the British Army had fourteen infantry depots, each bearing a letter. The depots were territorially organised, and Infantry Depot G at Colchester was the headquarters for the county regiments of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Huntingdonshire, Norfolk, Northamptonshire and Suffolk. In 1948, the depots adopted names and this depot became the East Anglian Brigade, with all regiments being reduced to a single battalion at the same time.

The src gene is oncogenic as it triggers uncontrolled growth in abnormal host cells. It was the first retroviral oncogene to be discovered. The src gene was taken up by RSV and incorporated into its genome conferring it with the advantage of being able to stimulate uncontrolled mitosis of host cells, providing abundant cells for fresh infection. The src gene is not essential for RSV proliferation but it greatly increases virulence when present.  Discovery  Francis Peyton Rous first proposed that viruses can cause cancer. He proved it in 1911 and was later awarded the Nobel prize in 1966. Chickens grow a tumor called a fibrosarcoma. Rous collected and ground up these sarcomas, and then centrifuged them to remove the solid material. Next, the remaining liquid mixture was injected into chicks. The chicks developed sarcomas. The causative agent in the liquid was a virus, this is now called the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV).  Function  Further research done later on by others showed that RSV was a type of retrovirus. It was found that the v-Src gene in RSV is required for the formation of cancer. A function for Src tyrosine kinases in normal cell growth was first demonstrated with the binding of family member p56lck to the cytoplasmic tail of the CD4 and CD8 co-receptors on T-cells. Src tyrosine kinases also transmit integrin-dependent signals central to cell movement and proliferation. Hallmarks of v-Src induced transformation are rounding of the cell and the formation of actin rich podosomes on the basal surface of the cell. These structures are correlated with increased invasiveness, a process thought to be essential for metastasis. v-Src lacks the C-terminal inhibitory phosphorylation site (tyrosine-527), and is therefore constitutively active as opposed to normal Src (c-Src) which is only activated under certain circumstances where it is required (e.g. growth factor signaling). v-Src is therefore an instructive example of an oncogene whereas c-Src is a proto- oncogene. The first sequence of v-Src was published in 1980 and the characterization of sites for tyrosine phosphorylation in the transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus and its normal cellular homologue was published in 1981.

The questions that Legal Anthropologists seek to answer concern how is law present in cultures? How does it manifest? How may anthropologists contribute to understandings of law? Earlier legal anthropological research focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation. Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski's 1926 work, Crime and Custom in Savage Society, explored law, order, crime, and punishment among the Trobriand Islanders.Malinowski, Bronislaw 1985[1926] Crime and Custom in Savage Society. Totowa, New Jersey: Rowman & Allanheld. The English lawyer Sir Henry Maine is often credited with founding the study of Legal Anthropology through his book Ancient Law (1861). An ethno-centric evolutionary perspective was pre-eminent in early Anthropological discourse on law, evident through terms applied such as ‚Äòpre-law‚Äô or ‚Äòproto-law‚Äô in describing indigenous cultures. However, though Maine‚Äôs evolutionary framework has been largely rejected within the discipline, the questions he raised have shaped the subsequent discourse of the study. Moreover, the 1926 publication of Crime and Custom in Savage Society by Malinowski based upon his time with the Trobriand Islanders, further helped establish the discipline of legal anthropology. Through emphasizing the order present in acephelous societies, Malinowski proposed the cross-cultural examining of law through its established functions as opposed to a discrete entity. This has led to multiple researchers and ethnographies examining such aspects as order, dispute, conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation, in addition (and often antagonistically) to law-centred studies, with small-societal studies leading to insightful self-reflections and better understanding of the founding concept of law. Contemporary research in legal anthropology has sought to apply its framework to issues at the intersections of law and culture, including human rights, legal pluralism, Islamophobia and political uprisings. What is law? Legal Anthropology provides a definition of law which differs from that found within modern legal systems. Hoebel (1954) offered the following definition of law: ‚ÄúA social norm is legal if its neglect or infraction is regularly met, in threat or in fact, by the application of physical force by an individual or group possessing the socially recognized privilege of so acting‚Äù Maine argued that human societies passing through three basic stages of legal development, from a group presided over by a senior agnate, through stages of territorial development and culminating in an elite forming normative laws of society, stating that ‚Äúwhat the juristical oligarchy now claims is to monopolize the knowledge of the laws, to have the exclusive possession of the principles by which quarrels are decided‚Äù This evolutionary approach, as has been stated, was subsequently replaced within the anthropological discourse by the need to examine the manifestations of law's societal function. As according to Hoebel, law has four functions: 1) to identify socially acceptable lines of behaviour for inclusion in the culture. 2) To allocate authority and who may legitimately apply force. 3) To settle trouble cases. 4) To redefine relationships as the concepts of life change. Legal theorist H. L. A. Hart, however, stated that law is a body of rules, and is a union of two sets of rules: # rules on conduct (\\"primary rules\\") H. L. A. Hart, \\"Law as the Union of Primary and Secondary Rules,\\" The Concept of Law. # rules about recognizing, changing, applying, and adjudicating on rules on conduct (\\"secondary rules\\") H. L. A. Hart, \\"Law as the Union of Primary and Secondary Rules,\\" The Concept of Law. Within modern English Theory, law is a discrete and specialized topic. Predominantly positivist in character, it is closely linked to notions of a rule-making body, the judiciary and enforcement agencies. The centralized state organisation and isolates are essentials to the attributes of rules, courts and sanctions. To learn more on this view, see Hobbes. 1651 Leviathan, part 2, chapter 26 or Salmond, J. 1902 Jurisprudence. However, this view of law is not applicable everywhere. There are many acephelous societies around the world where the above control mechanisms are absent. There are no conceptualized and isolated set of normative rules ‚Äì these are instead embodied in everyday life. Even when there may be a discrete set of legal norms, these are not treated similarly to the English Legal System's unequivocal power and unchallenged pre-eminence. Shamans, fighting and supernatural means are all mechanisms of superimposing rules within other societies. For example, within Rasmussen‚Äôs work of Across Arctic America (1927) he recounts Eskimo nith-songs being used as a public reprimand by expressing the wrongdoing of someone guilty. Thus, instead of focusing upon the explicit manifestations of law, legal anthropologists have taken to examining the functions of law and how it is expressed. A view expressed by Leopold Pospisil and encapsulated by Bronislaw Malinowski: ‚ÄúIn such primitive communities I personally believe that law ought to be defined by function and not by form, that is we ought to see what are the arrangements, the sociological realities, the cultural mechanisms which act for the enforcement of law‚Äù(1934: Introduction to Hogbin, Law and Order in Polynesia). Thus, law has been studied in ways that may be categorized by as: 1) prescriptive rules 2) observable regularities 3) Instances of dispute. Processual paradigm: order and conflict Order and regulatory behaviour are required if social life is to be maintained. The scale and shade of this behaviour depends on the values and beliefs held by a society deriving from implicit understandings of the norm developed through socialization. There are socially constructed norms with varying degrees of explicitness and levels of order. Conflict may not be interpreted as an extreme pathological event but as a regulatory acting force. This processual understanding of conflict and dispute became apparent and subsequently heavily theorized upon by the anthropological discipline within the latter half of the nineteenth century as a gateway to the law and order of a society. Disputes have come to be recognised as necessary and constructive over pathological whilst the stated rules of law only explain some aspects of control and compliance. The context and interactions of a dispute are more informative about a culture than the rules. Classic studies deriving theories of order from disputes include Evans-Pritchard work Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande which focused upon functional disputes surrounding sorcery and witchcraft practices, or Comaroff and Roberts (1981) work among the Tswana which examine the hierarchy of disputes, the patterns of contact and the effect norms affect the course of dispute as norms important to dispute are rarely ‚Äúespecially organised for jural purpose‚Äù (Bohannan, 1957:58). Other examples include: Leach, 1954. Political Systems of Highland Burma. Barth, 1959. Political Leadership among Swat Pathans. Case study approach Within the history of Legal Anthropology there have been various methods of data gathering adopted; ranging from literature review of traveller/missionary accounts, consulting informants and lengthy participant observation. Furthermore, when evaluating any research it is appropriate to have a robust methodology capable of scientifically analysing the topic at hand. The broad method of study by legal anthropologists prevails upon the Case Study Approach first developed by Llewellyn and Hoebel in The Cheyenne Way (1941) not as ‚Äúa philosophy but a technology‚Äù (Pospisil, 1973: 541). This methodology is applied to situations of cross-cultural conflict and the correlating resolution, which can have sets of legal notions and jural regularities extracted from them (Bohannan, 1965: pp. 41; Pospisil, 1973). This method may be safe-guarded against accusations of imposing western ideological structures as it is often an emic sentiment: for example, ‚ÄúThe Tiv drove me to the case method‚Ä¶what they were interested in. They put a lot of time and effort into cases‚Äù (Bohannan, 1989: vii). Issues of terminology and ethnology Regarding law, in Anthropology's characteristically self-conscious manner, the comparative analysis inherent to Legal Anthropology has been speculated upon and most famously debated by Paul Bohannan and Max Gluckman. The discourse highlights one of the primary differences between British and American Anthropology regarding fieldwork approaches and concerns the imposition of Western terminology as ethnological categories of differing societies.(Bohannan, 1956). Each author's uses the Case Study Approach, however, the data's presentation in terms of achieving comparativeness is a point of contention between them. Paul Bohannan promotes the use of native terminology presented with ethnographic meaning as opposed to any Universal categories, which act as barriers to understanding the true nature of a culture's legal system. Advocating that it is better to appreciate native terms in their own medium, Bohannan critiques Gluckman's work for its inherent bias. Gluckman has argued that Bohannan's excessive use of native terminology creates barriers when attempting to achieve comparative analysis. He in turn has suggested that in order to further the cross-cultural comparative study of law, we should use English terms and concepts of law which will aid in the refinement of dispute facts and interrelations (Gluckman, 1965: 26). Thus, all native terms should be described and translated into an Anglo-American conceptual equivalent for the purpose of comparison. Processes and methodologies As disputes and order began to be recognised as categories worthy of study, interest in the inherent aspects of conflicts emerged within legal anthropology. The processes and actors involved within the events became an object of study for ethnographers as they embraced conflict as a data-rich source. One example of such an interest is expressed by Philip Gulliver, 1963, Social Control in an African Society in which the intimate relations between disputes are postulated as being important. He examines the patterns of alliance between actors of a dispute and the strategies that develop as a result, the roles of mediators and the typologies for intervention. Another is Sara Ross, whose work Law and Intangible Cultural Heritage in the City focuses the rubric of legal anthropology specifically onto the urban context through an \\"urban legal anthropology\\", that includes the use of virtual ethnography, institutional ethnography, and participant observation in urban public and private spaces. Key questions in legal anthropology *Issues of Legal Pluralism. See Lyon, 2002 Local arbitration and conflict deferment in Punjab, Pakistan or Engel, D. 1980. Legal pluralism in an American community: perspectives on a civil trial court. *The legitimacy of Universal Human Rights. Political anthropologists have had much to say about the UDHR(Universal Declaration of Human Rights). Original critiques, most notably by the AAA(American Anthropological Association), argued that cultural ideas of rights and entitlement differ between societies. They warned that any attempt to endorse one set of values above all others amounted to a new western imperialism, and would be counter to ideas of cultural relativism. Most anthropologists now agree that universal human rights have a useful place in today's world. Zechenter (1997) argues there are practices, such as Indian 'sati' (the burning of a widow on her husband's funeral pyre) that can be said to be wrong, despite justifications of tradition. This is because such practices are about much more than a culturally established world view, and frequently develop or revive as a result of socio-economic conditions and the balance of power within a community. As culture is not bounded and unchanging, there are multiple discourses and moral viewpoints within any community and among the various actors in such events (Merry 2003). Cultural relativists risk supporting the most powerfully asserted position at the expense of those who are subjugated under it. More recent contributions to the question of universal human rights include analysis of their use in practice, and how global discourses are translated into local contexts (Merry 2003). Anthropologists such as Merry (2006) note how the legal framework of the UNDHR is not static but is actively used by communities around the globe to construct meaning. As much as the document is a product of western Enlightenment thinking, communities have the capacity to shape its meaning to suit their own agendas, incorporating its principles in ways that empower them to tackle their own local and national discontents. Female genital cutting (FGC), also known as female circumcision or female genital mutilation remains a hotly debated, controversial issue contested particularly among legal anthropologists and human rights activists. Through her ethnography (1989) on the practice of pharonic circumcision among the Hofriyat of Sudan (1989) Boddy maintains that understanding local cultural norms is of crucial importance when considering intervention to prevent the practice. Human rights activists attempting to eradicate FGC using the legal framework of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UNDHR) as their justification, run the risk of imposing a set of ideological principles, alien to the culture attempting to be helped, potentially facing hostile reactions. Moreover, the UNDHR as a legal document, is contested by some as being restrictive in its prescription of what is and is not deemed a violation of a human right (Ross 2003) and overlooks local customary justifications which operate outside of an international legalistic framework (Ross 2003). Increasingly (FGC) is becoming a global issue due to increased mobility. What was once deemed a largely African practice has seen a steady increase in European countries such as Britain. Although made illegal in 1985 there have as yet been no convictions and girls as old as nine continue to have the procedure. Legislation has now also been passed in Sweden, the United States and France where there have been convictions. Black, J. A. and Debelle, G. D. (1995) \\"Female Genital Mutilation in Britain\\" British Medical Journal. Further information There are a number of useful introductions to the field of legal anthropology,See, for example Moore, Sally Falk, Law and Anthropology: A Reader, (edited), Blackwell, 2004, pp. 20-25, Sally Falk Moore, a leading legal anthropologist, held both a law degree and a PhD in anthropology. An increasing number of legal anthropologists hold both JDs and advanced degrees in anthropology, and some teach in law schools while maintaining scholarly connections within the field of legal anthropology; examples include Rebecca French, John Conley, Elizabeth Mertz, and Annelise Riles. Such combined expertise has also been turned to more applied anthropological pursuits such as tribal advocacy and forensic ethnography by practitioners. There is a growing interest in the intersection of legal and linguistic anthropology. If looking for Anthropology departments with faculty specializing in legal anthropology in North America, try the following schools and professors: University of California, Berkeley (Laura Nader), University of California, Irvine (Susan Bibler Coutin, Bill Maurer), University of Chicago (Justin B. Richland), Duke University (William M. O'Barr), Princeton University (Lawrence Rosen, Carol J. Greenhouse), State University of New York at Buffalo (Rebecca French), New York University (Sally Engle Merry), Harvard University (Jean Comaroff and John Comaroff) and Cornell University (Annelise Riles), and George Mason University (Susan Hirsch).Disciplines & Subdisciplines- Legal Anthropology In Europe, the following scholars and schools will be good resources: Vanja Hamziƒá (SOAS University of London), Jane Cowan (University of Sussex), Ann Griffiths and Toby Kelly (University of Edinburgh), Sari Wastell (Goldsmiths, University of London), Harri Englund and Yael Navaro (University of Cambridge), and Richard Rottenburg (Martin-Luther Universit√§t). The Association for Political and Legal Anthropology (APLA), a section of the American Anthropological Association, is the primary professional association in the U.S. for legal anthropologists and also has many overseas members. It publishes PoLAR: Political and Legal Anthropology Review, the leading U.S. journal in the field of legal anthropology, which is accessible via http://polarjournal.org/ or http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1555-2934 'Allegra: a Virtual Laboratory of Legal Anthropology' is an online experiment by a new generation of legal anthropologists designated to facilitate scholarly collaboration and awareness of the sub-discipline.

It is similar to Square Mile and Prize Property. In Hotel the players build resort hotels and attempt to drive their competitors into bankruptcy. It was re-released by Asmodee in 2014 as Hotel Tycoon (or Hotel Deluxe in some countries), but is now out of print again. Gameplay Players take turns moving around the board. Each square on the board is adjacent to one or two hotel properties. Most of the squares are either purchase squares or building squares. Whenever a player lands on a purchase square which is adjacent to an unowned property they may buy that property by paying the purchase price. Once they own a property they may attempt to build on it whenever they land on a building square. A special dice is rolled to determine if permission to build is granted or denied. If it is denied the player must wait for a later turn. When permission is granted to build the player may add new buildings or facilities to their property. Each hotel has from one to five buildings and a set of recreational facilities. The main building must be built first, followed by the other buildings then the facilities. The cost of each addition is listed on the deed card for the property. Once a player has at least one building on a property they may add entrances to their hotels. One entrance can be placed on each square of the board. If a player lands on an entrance for a hotel belonging to another player they must pay the owner to stay at that hotel. The cost of staying depends on the number of buildings and facilities in the property. If the player cannot afford to stay at the hotel they must put their own properties up for auction to raise money. A player who loses all of their money and properties is out of the game. The last player remaining is the winner. Hotel shares many gameplay concepts with Monopoly, including the buying of property with a deed, improvement of the property and collecting a fee for landing on that property. Players also collect $2000/¬£2000 each time they round the board, akin to Monopoly's $200 for passing Go.

During its history, the company was variously active in automotive retailing, aircraft manufacturing, automotive coachbuilding and electrical services. It was formally founded in 1905 by Gerald Mann, an electrical engineer, and Hubert Egerton, although the two had been working in partnership for a number of preceding years (the \\"Tern\\" logo used in the 1960s was often accompanied by the statement \\"ESTD. 1898\\"). Besides car dealing, the company continued electrical installation work. History In 1909, the company supplied its first custom built car body for a Rolls-Royce. By 1913, it had branches across East Anglia, and in London. Starting in 1915, the company was required to build aeroplanes for the national war effort. Most of the aircraft were built under licence, including 22 Short Admiralty Type 184s and 20 Short Bombers;.Barnes & James, p.541. Towards the end of the conflict, the firm built 100 SPAD S.VII French designed fighters. The company also produced ten examples of its own Type B, a further development of the Short Type 184.Mason 1994, p.72. In the Second World War, they built vehicle bodies for the Government, especially the ambulance Austin K2/Y. The headquarters were in Prince of Wales Road, Norwich, where they had one dealership of British Leyland. The garage in Surrey Street Norwich had a dealership of Ford, and commercial vehicles and the woodworking business were run from premises on Cromer Road, Norwich. Over the years garages in several other towns were opened or acquired, including central London where they sold Rolls Royce and Bentley cars, Finchley, Lowestoft, Uttoxeter, Leicester, Nottingham (formerly Atkeys), Derby and Worcester. In 1964, the electrical department was sold to the Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company. Mann Egerton was acquired by Inchcape plc in September 1973, although its woodworking business continued until bought out by the management in 1986. The woodworking business made school furniture. The vehicles made by the coachbuilding business included refrigerated vehicles for companies, such as Findus and Birds Eye. The business was sold to Bonallack Coachbuilders.

This resolution amends Chapter V of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), regulation 19-1 and binds all governments which have contracted to the IMO. The LRIT regulation will apply to the following ship types engaged on international voyages: * All passenger ships including high-speed craft, * Cargo ships, including high-speed craft of 300 gross tonnage and above, and * Mobile offshore drilling units. These ships must report their position to their flag administration at least four times a day. Most vessels set their existing satellite communications systems to automatically make these reports. Other contracting governments may request information about vessels in which they have a legitimate interest under the regulation. The LRIT system consists of the already installed (generally) shipborne satellite communications equipment, communications service providers (CSPs), application service providers (ASPs), LRIT data centres, the LRIT data distribution plan and the International LRIT data exchange. Certain aspects of the performance of the LRIT system are reviewed or audited by the LRIT coordinator acting on behalf of the IMO and its contracting governments. Some confuse the functions of LRIT with that of AIS (Automatic Identification System), a collision avoidance system also mandated by the IMO, which operates in the VHF radio band, with a range only slightly greater than line-of-sight. While AIS was originally designed for short-range operation as a collision avoidance and navigational aid, it has now been shown to be possible to receive AIS signals by satellite in many, but not all, parts of the world. This is becoming known as S-AIS and is completely different from LRIT. The only similarity is that AIS is also collected from space for determining location of vessels, but requires no action from the vessels themselves except they must have their AIS system turned on. LRIT requires the active, willing participation of the vessel involved, which is, in and of itself, a very useful indication as to whether the vessel in question is a lawful actor. Thus the information collected from the two systems, S-AIS and LRIT, are mutually complementary, and S-AIS clearly does not make LRIT superfluous in any manner. Indeed, because of co-channel interference near densely populated or congested sea areas satellites are having a difficult time in detecting AIS from space in those areas. Fixes are under development by several organizations, but how effective they will be remains to be seen. European implementation Following the EU Council Resolution of 2 October 2007, EU Member States (MS) decided to establish an EU LRIT Data Centre (EU LRIT DC). According to the Council Resolution, the Commission is in charge of managing the EU LRIT DC, in cooperation with Member States, through the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA). The Agency, in particular, is in charge of the technical development, operation and maintenance of the EU LRIT DC. It also ‚Äústresses that the objective of the EU LRIT DC should include maritime security, Search and Rescue (SAR), maritime safety and protection of the marine environment, taking into consideration respective developments within the IMO context.‚Äù North American implementation =Canada = In January 2009 Canada become one of the first SOLAS contracting governments to implement a national data centre and comply with the LRIT regulation. =United States = In January 2009, the United States became one of the first SOLAS contracting governments to implement a National Data Centre and comply with the LRIT regulation. Currently the US Authorized Application Service Provider (ASP) is Pole Star Space Applications Ltd.. LRIT was proposed by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in London during the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks to track the approximately 50,000 large ships around the world. In the United States integration of LRIT information with that from sensors and enables the Coast Guard to correlate Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) data with data from other sources, detect anomalies, and heighten overall Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA). The United States implementation of this regulation is consistent with the Coast Guard's strategic goals of maritime security and maritime safety, and the Department's strategic goals of awareness, prevention, protection, and response. Every sovereign nation already has the right to request such information (and does so) for ships destined for their ports. The LRIT regulation and computer system will allow the USCG to receive information about all vessels within of US territory providing the vessel's flag administration has not excluded the US from receiving such information. For a more detailed description of the United States implementation of the LRIT system, please refer to the NPRM published October 3, 2007, in the US Government Federal Register (72 FR 56600).Federal Register: April 29, 2008 (Volume 73, Number 83) =Marshall Islands= Marshall Islands, one of the largest ship registries in the world, established one of the first prototype Data Centres, using Pole Star Space Applications.

It is loosely based on \\"William Wilson\\", a short story by Edgar Allan Poe, the poem The December Night by Alfred de Musset,Der Student Von Prag - Film (Movie) Plot and Review and Faust. The film was remade in 1926, under the same title The Student of Prague. Other remakes were produced in 1935 and 2004. The film stars Paul Wegener in his film debut. It is generally deemed to be the first art film in history. It was shot at the Babelsberg Studios and on location around Prague. The film's sets were designed by the art director Robert A. Dietrich. Plot The film takes place at the University of Prague in 1820, where a poor young man named Balduin is the city's wildest student and greatest swordsman. He becomes smitten with Countess Margit Schwarzenberg after rescuing her from drowning but knows he cannot pursue his love for her because he is poor. A sorcerer named Scapinelli offers Balduin 100,000 pieces of gold in exchange for any item to be found in the student's room. Balduin agrees, thinking he owns nothing, but is astonished when Scapinelli calls forth Balduin's reflection from the mirror and absconds with it. Balduin attempts to woo Countess Margit but is haunted by the appearance of his mirror double. Baron Waldis-Schwarzenberg, the countess's fianc√© and cousin, challenges Balduin to a duel for her hand. Privately, the countess's father begs Balduin not to kill the Baron, as he is the last surviving heir to their family fortune. Balduin agrees but is thwarted when his double appears at the duel in his place and kills the rival suitor. Balduin sneaks into Margit‚Äôs room and she confesses her true feelings to him. However, she is frightened by the appearance of the double, collapsing in a swoon. Dejected, Balduin returns to his room to retrieve a pistol. He fires at his double, only to drop dead himself. Scapinelli then comes into the room takes the contract Balduin signed with him tears it up, throws it like confetti and disappears out the door.

Eric Rentschler, Methuen Inc., NY, NY, 1986, p. 9Brockman, Stephen. A Critical History of German Film, Camden House, 2016, p. 29 It was a critical and commercial success. Audiences flocked to see the film, in part because it tapped into a very real sense of dissociation and alienation inherent in a society that was struggling with the burgeoning collapse of the German empire.Hake, Sabine, German National Cinema 2nd ed., Routledge, NY, NY, 2008 p. 22 The film's star, Paul Wegener, was an avowed champion of the medium after realizing the potential of cinema to transcend the limits of conventional theater.Hake, page 26 Cinematographer Guido Seeber utilized groundbreaking camera tricks to create the effect of the Doppelg√§nger (mirror double), producing a seamless double exposure. Hanns Heinz Ewers was a noted writer of horror and fantasy stories whose involvement with the screenplay lent a much needed air of respectability to the fledgling art form.Schl√ºpmann, p. 10 The film also stimulated interest in the still very new field of psychoanalysis. Otto Rank published an extensive plot summary of the film in his article ‚ÄúDer Doppelg√§nger,‚Äù which ran in Sigmund Freud's academic journal Imago in 1914. Examples of the Doppelg√§nger are most prevalent in literature as a narcissistic defense against sexual love, according to Rank, who described how the mirror image of the student shows up in erotic situations to deny Balduin any progress in his attempts to woo the countess.Schl√ºpmann, p. 12-15 The fantastic themes of the film went on to become a major influence on Weimar cinema, continuing the exploration of social change and insecurity in the aftermath of World War I.Brockman, p. 45 Expressionism grew out of the tormented psyches of artists and writers coming to terms with their individual experiences. The use of chiaroscuro (sharp contrasts between light and shadow) was already established on the set of The Student of Prague, but was then carried further by Weimar productions like Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari.Brockman, p. 50 References in popular culture The film is referenced in the detective story \\"The Image in the Mirror\\" by Dorothy Sayers, in which Lord Peter Wimsey helps clear Mr. Duckworthy, a man wrongly suspected of murder. Among other things Duckworthy tells: > \\"When I was seven or eight, my mother took me with her to see a film called > \\"The Student of Prague\\".(...) It was a costume piece about a young man at > the university who sold himself to the devil, and one day his reflection > came stalking out of the mirror on its own, and went about committing > dreadful crimes, so that everybody thought it was him.\\" (In the story, Mr. Duckworthy had what seemed a similar experience - but Wimsey eventually proves that it had a rational explanation involving no supernatural agency).

Early life Lucy Catherine Lloyd was born in Norbury in England on 7 November 1834. Her father, William H.C. Lloyd, Archdeacon of Durban, was the rector of Norbury and vicar of Ranton, two villages in western England in Staffordshire. He was also chaplain to the Earl of Lichfield, to whom he was related through his mother. Lucy Lloyd's mother was Lucy Anne Jeffreys, also a minister's daughter, who died in 1842 when Lucy was eight. Lucy Lloyd was the second of four daughters. Her father remarried in 1844 and had 13 additional children with his new wife. After her mother's death, Lucy and her sisters lived with their maternal uncle and his wife, Sir John and Caroline Dundas, from whom they received a private and apparently liberal education. In 1847 Robert Gray was consecrated Bishop of Cape Town. William Lloyd was sent to Durban along with his family in April 1849, when Lucy was 14, as colonial and military chaplain to the Colony of Natal's British forces. In 1852 Gray established the Diocese of Natal with John William Colenso as its first bishop. Colenso established his residence at Bishopstowe, near Pietermaritzburg and a party of 45 accompanied him, including the young Wilhelm Bleek who was to assist Colenso as anthropologist and philologist. William Lloyd later became archdeacon of Durban. The Lloyd family had limited financial means in Durban even though the four older girls had inherited some money from their mother. Lucy and her sisters are said to have had liberal and unorthodox views and Lucy had trained as a teacher. Lucy and Jemima (who was to marry Wilhelm Bleek) were very close, and both were repelled by their father whom they thought to be a hypocrite. After Lucy had refused to allow him to spend her inheritance he threw her out of their home and she went to stay on a farm owned by people called the Middletons. In 1858 Lucy became engaged to the sweet and widely travelled man George Woolley, the son of a minister. According to Lucy's sister Jemima the Middletons were wretched people who sowed distrust and pain between the couple. Lucy broke off the engagement, but she regretted this all her life, blaming herself for George's early miserable death. In a letter she wrote much later to her niece, Helma, on the occasion of the latter's engagement she said: 'May yours (with your dear Mother beside you), have a very different ending. I missed my dear Mother so sorely then, and the loving counsel and advice, which she could have given me. I had only my own theories and inexperience to go upon.' Collaboration with Wilhelm Bleek Lucy's sister, Jemima, married Wilhelm Bleek on 22 November 1862 and they had seven children, five of whom survived to adulthood. In the same year as his marriage, Bleek was appointed curator of the Grey Collection at the South African Library in Cape Town. Lucy travelled to Cape Town from Durban aboard the Natal mail steamer, the SS Waldensian, in October 1862, for the wedding of her sister. The ship ran aground on a reef near Cape Agulhas and, although the passengers and crew were rescued, Lucy lost most of her possessions and wedding gifts, managing to retrieve only a pair of vases for her sister (which she carried on her lap in the lifeboat) and a set of Sir Walter Scott's novels that had washed ashore in good condition as they were wrapped in waterproof packaging. Lucy settled with her sister and Wilhelm after their marriage. After living at first in New Street, the Bleek family moved to The Hill in Mowbray. Lucy started her work with oral histories on the arrival of the first Xam (Cape Bushman) speaker at Mowbray in 1870, after which she was responsible for two-thirds of the texts recorded until Bleek's death and the publication of their second report to the Cape Parliament in 1875. After Bleek's death, and true to the desire expressed in a codicil to his will written in 1871, Lucy continued working on their joint Bushman studies with the support of her sister, Bleek's widow, Jemima. While Lucy would undoubtedly have done this anyway, his request must surely have bestowed on her work the credibility that, in those days, was usually reserved for male scholars and researchers. Fanny and Julia Lloyd joined the Bleek and Lloyd household (now at Charlton House, also in Mowbray). Lucy was appointed curator of the Grey Collection as successor to Bleek after his death in 1875, at half his salary, a position she accepted reluctantly. During this time she worked with the Grey Collection and at editing various manuscripts collected by Bleek, as well as continuing with her Xam research in her own time. She began corresponding with George W. Stow in 1875 about his copies of Bushman art, and in 1876 he proposed a book that would eventually be published (with Lucy's support) in an incomplete form as The Native Races of Southern Africa. Lucy also played an important role in the founding of the SA Folklore Society, for which she acted as secretary for a while, and in the founding of the Folklore Journal in 1879. Lucy's services at the South African Library were terminated in 1880 when Dr Theophilus Hahn was appointed, after a long and painful saga, in her place. Her relationship with the library had been fraught, and particularly with the Cape Colony's Secretary-General for Education Langham Dale who made the new appointment. She thought Hahn to be a fool and his appointment a disaster. Lloyd and the trustees of the Grey Collection, who supported her, took the case to the Supreme Court for judgment. The appointment, however, went ahead. Hahn resigned two years later, after which no custodian of the collection was appointed. After Stow's death in 1882, Lloyd purchased his tracings and copies of Bushman paintings as well as the manuscript of Native Races from his wife, Fanny Stow. Lucy then engaged the services of the historian George McCall Theal to work with her on the manuscript and edit it. It was published in London in 1905 along with some photographic images taken from Lucy's own collection. Return to Europe Lucy Lloyd and her sister Fanny went to England for a time in 1883, for financial and health-related reasons. Lucy's letters show her to have been ill at the time. Indeed, she described herself as having endured ‚Äòyears of overwork and many of ill-health'. After the loss of her position at the South African Library, the family had found themselves in a precarious financial position with too many mouths to feed ‚Äì at times, whole families, numbers of adults as well as children, often in poor health, lived in their home ‚Äì and Lucy's last recorded work with the Bushmen appears to have been in 1884. All in all, at least 17 people had lived in the Mowbray household between 1870 and 1884, some for extended periods. Expenses included food, clothing and tobacco (according to Bleek's list of expenses for 1871 he also budgeted for the arrival of the informants' wives). After Bleek's death in 1875, followed by the loss of Lloyd's job, Jemima Bleek and Lucy Lloyd were responsible for the upkeep of their various guests and their families, as well as their own sisters and young children. As a result of these financial constraints, Jemima Bleek moved her family to Germany in 1884 to stay with relatives and receive schooling there, and it appears that the other Lloyd sisters joined them. Lucy Lloyd is believed to have gone to Europe in 1887 ‚Äì around this time she trained her niece Dorothea in Bushman research ‚Äì and she moved between Germany, Switzerland, England and Wales, with occasional trips to the Cape around 1905 and 1907. She returned permanently to South Africa in 1912. The Bleek family remained in Germany for the following 21 years. Contributions and awards Lucy Lloyd submitted a third report to the Cape Government concerning 'Bushman Researches', dated London 8 May 1889, in which she added 4,534 half-pages or columns to the collection. In 1911 a selection of texts from Bleek and Lloyd's extraordinary project ‚Äì and a considerable achievement given Lloyd's personal circumstances at the time ‚Äì was edited by her and published as Specimens of Bushman Folklore. In 1913 Lloyd received an honorary doctorate from the University of the Cape of Good Hope in recognition of her contribution to research. In the words of the time, the citation read: She was the first woman to receive this degree in South Africa. Death Lucy Lloyd's grave, Wynberg Cemetery, Cape Town Lucy Lloyd died at Charlton House on 31 August 1914 at the age of 79, and is buried in the Wynberg cemetery in Cape Town near her nieces and nephew and Wilhelm Bleek himself.

Modern Germany was formed in 1871 when Otto von Bismarck unified most of the German states, with the notable exception of Austria, into the German Empire.Timeline: Germany - BBC News After the First World War, Germany lost about 10% of its territory to its neighbours and the Weimar Republic was formed. This republic included territories to the east of today's German borders. The period of Nazi rule from the 1930s through the end of the Second World War brought significant territorial losses for the country. Nazi Germany initially expanded the country's territory dramatically and conquered most of Europe, though not all areas were added to Germany officially. The Nazis' fortunes changed after the failure of the invasion of Soviet Union. The Nazi regime eventually collapsed, and the Allies occupied Germany. Immediately after the war, all territorial gains were reversed and pre-war Germany was split into British, French and American occupation zones in the northwest, west and south and a Soviet occupation zone in the centre; the capital Berlin was similarly divided into four sectors. The former eastern territories of Germany were ceded to Poland and the Soviet Union and the Oder and Neisse Rivers became Germany's new eastern boundary. This territory became Poland's so-called \\"Recovered Territories\\", while approximately one-third of East Prussia became Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast; virtually the entire German population in these areas was expelled or fled. In the west, the Saar area formed a French-controlled protectorate with limited autonomy, but its own citizenship laws. With the onset of the Cold War, the western part of Germany was unified as the Trizone, becoming the Federal Republic of Germany in May 1949 (\\"West Germany\\"). Western-occupied West Berlin declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 but was denied by the occupying powers. The Soviet zone, including the Soviet sector of Berlin, became the communist German Democratic Republic (\\"East Germany\\") in October the same year. Effective 1 January 1957 the Saar Protectorate declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany, as provided by its Grundgesetz (constitution) art. 23 (Little Reunification). Following the end of the Cold War, East Germany, including East Berlin, and West Berlin used the same West German constitutional clause and declared their accession to the Federal Republic of Germany effective 3 October 1990 - an event referred to as German reunification. Background =German settlement in Central and Eastern Europe= Prussia by the Teutonic Knights in the Prussian Crusade, German settlers were brought in, displacing the indigenous Old Prussians Part of the motivation behind the territorial changes is based on historical events in Germany and Western Europe. Migrations that took place over more than a millennium led to pockets of Germans living throughout Central and Eastern Europe as far east as Russia. The existence of these enclaves was sometimes used by German nationalists, such as the Nazis, to justify territorial claims. =The rise of European nationalism= The territorial changes of Germany after World War II can be interpreted in the context of the evolution of global nationalism and European nationalism. The latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century saw the rise of nationalism in Europe. Previously, a country consisted largely of whatever peoples lived on the land that was under the dominion of a particular ruler. As principalities and kingdoms grew through conquest and marriage, a ruler could wind up with many different ethnicities under his dominion. The concept of nationalism was based on the idea of a \\"people\\" who shared a common bond through race, religion, language and culture. Furthermore, nationalism asserted that each \\"people\\" had a right to its own state. Thus, much of European history in the latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century can be understood as efforts to realign national boundaries with this concept of \\"one people, one state\\". Many interior conflicts were a result of more or less pressurising citizens of alternative ethnicities and/or other native languages to assimilate to the ethnicity dominant in the state. Switzerland was the exception, lacking a common native language. Much conflict would arise when one nation asserted territorial rights to land outside its borders on the basis of an ethnic bond with the people living on the land. Another source of conflict arose when a group of people who constituted a minority in one nation would seek to secede from the nation either to form an independent nation or join another nation with whom they felt stronger ties. Yet another source of conflict was the desire of some nations to expel people from territory within its borders because people did not share a common bond with the majority of people of that nation. Formation of the German Empire Growth of Brandenburg-Prussia. During the Partitions of Poland between 1772 and 1795, Prussia annexed large swaths of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth Prussia shown in blue) =Prussia= Following the capture of Silesia in 1742 by Frederick the Great during the Silesian Wars with the Habsburg Monarchy, the territorial expansion of the Kingdom of Prussia continued with the annexation of lands belonging to the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. During the Partitions of Poland between 1772 and 1795, Prussia seized 141,400 km2 (54,600 sq mi) of the Commonwealth's western territory, including the regions of Greater Poland, Pomorze, Mazovia and the Duchy of Siewierz. Subsequently, renaming them as South Prussia, West Prussia, New East Prussia and New Silesia. After the annexation of the Polish territories, Frederick the Great immediately sent 57,475 German families to the newly conquered lands in order to solidify his new acquisitions,Ritter, Gerhard (1974).

Berkeley: University of California Press. pp. 179‚Äì180. . and abolished the use of the Polish language.Andrzej Chwalba, Historia Polski 1795-1918, Wydawnictwo Literackie 2000, Krak√≥w, pages 175-184, and 307-312. . =North German Confederation= Following the Napoleonic wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire the North German Confederation, led by Prussia, was combined with the southern states of Baden, W√ºrttemberg, Bavaria and Hesse and the formerly French newly annexed Alsace-Lorraine to form the German Empire in 1871. In some areas of Prussia's eastern provinces, such as the Province of Posen, the majority of the population was Polish. Many Lorrainians were by native language French. Many Alsatians and Lorrainians of German language clung to France (see ), despite their native languages. =Heligoland= Britain ceded Heligoland to Germany in 1890 in accordance with the terms of the Heligoland‚ÄìZanzibar Treaty. The Heligolanders, then still prevailingly fluent in their Heligolandic dialect of North Frisian, adopted German citizenship, like many other Frisians of Germany along the North Sea coast. World War I World War I Allied propaganda poster showing German expansionist ambitions =Brest-Litovsk= As part of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Russia's new Bolshevik (communist) government renounced all claim to Finland, the future Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), Poland, Belarus, Ukraine. Most of these territories were in effect ceded to the German Empire, intended to become economically dependent on and politically closely tied to that empire under different German kings and dukes. Regarding the ceded territories, the treaty stated that \\"Germany and Austria-Hungary intend to determine the future fate of these territories in agreement with their population\\" with few other effects than the appointment of German rulers to the new thrones of Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Territorial changes after World War I =Treaty of Versailles= thumb320pxGermany after Versailles \\\\---- The provisions of the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I obliged Germany to cede some territory to other countries. Besides the loss of the German colonial empire the territories Germany lost were: * Alsace-Lorraine, which were part of Germany for 48 years, in accordance with the Preliminaries of Peace signed at Versailles on 26 February 1871, and the Treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871, returned under French sovereignty without a plebiscite as a precondition to armistice (i.e. and therefore not as a clause of the Treaty of Versailles) with effect from the date of the armistice (11 November 1918), (, 1,815,000 inhabitants (1905)). * Northern Schleswig including the German-dominated towns of Tondern (T√∏nder), Apenrade (Aabenraa) and Sonderburg (S√∏nderborg) in Schleswig-Holstein, after the Schleswig Plebiscite, to Denmark (, 163,600 inhabitants (1920)). * The Prussian provinces Posen and West Prussia, which Prussia had annexed in Partitions of Poland (1772‚Äì1795), were given to the new country of Poland. Most of this territory had already been occupied by Polish rebels during the Greater Poland Uprising of 1918-1919 (, 4,224,000 inhabitants (1931), including and 26,000 inhabitants from Upper Silesia). Minor areas of both the provinces remained in Germany and were combined to become the new Prussian province of Grenzmark Posen-West Prussia. In these territories ceded to Poland, a sizeable German population remained. * The Hluƒç√≠n Region (Hluƒç√≠nsko around Hultschin) of Upper Silesia to Czechoslovakia (area 316 or 333 km¬≤, 49,000 inhabitants). * East Upper Silesia, to Poland (area out of - around 30% with 965,000 inhabitants ), after Upper Silesia plebiscite in which 60% had voted in favor of remaining German and 40% wanted whole Upper Silesia to become Polish. The vote was designed to provide guidance on how to divide the area, and most of the areas voting for Poland were separated from Germany. * The area of Eupen-Malmedy to Belgium, along with the Vennbahn railway trackbed (which created six German enclaves within Belgian territory). * The northern part of East Prussia as Memelland under control of France, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom, later transferred to Lithuania without a vote. * The area of Soldau in East Prussia (a railway station on the Warsaw-Danzig route) to Poland (area ). * From the eastern part of West Prussia and the southern part of East Prussia Warmia and Masuria, an area to Poland (see East Prussian plebiscite); contrary what nationalists claim, that ethnicity should determine national identity, the majority of the Slavonic Masurians voted to remain part of Germany. * The Saar area to be under the control of the League of Nations for 15 years, after that a vote between France and Germany, to decide to which country it would belong. During this time the coal was given to France. * The port of Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk, Poland) with the delta of Vistula river at the Baltic Sea was made the Free City of Danzig (Freie Stadt Danzig) under the League of Nations. (area , 408,000 inhabitants (1929)), 90% Germans. * Germany acknowledges and will respect strictly the independence of Austria. =Sudetenland= The Sudeten Germans had attempted to prevent the German language border areas of former Austria-Hungary from becoming part of Czechoslovakia in 1918. Once part of Bohemia, they had proclaimed the German-Austrian province of Sudetenland in October 1918, voting instead to join the newly declared Republic of German Austria in November 1918. However, this had been forbidden by the victorious allied powers of the First World War (the Treaty of Saint-Germain) and by the Czechoslovak government, partly with force of arms in 1919. Many Sudeten Germans rejected an affiliation to Czechoslovakia, since they had been refused the right to self-determination promised by US president Woodrow Wilson in his Fourteen Points of January 1918. =Silesian uprisings= The Silesian Uprisings () were a series of three armed uprisings (1919‚Äì1921) of Poles in the Upper Silesia region against Weimar Republic in order to separate the region (where in some parts Poles constituted a majority) from Germany and join it with the Second Polish Republic. Interbellum =Territorial claims of German nationalists= By World War I, there were isolated groups of Germans or so-called Schwaben as far southeast as the Bosphorus (Turkey), Georgia, and Azerbaijan. After the war, Germany's and Austria-Hungary's loss of territory and the rise of communism in the Soviet Union meant that more Germans than ever constituted sizable minorities in various countries. German nationalists used the existence of large German minorities in other countries as a basis for territorial claims. Many of the propaganda themes of the Nazi regime against Czechoslovakia and Poland claimed that the ethnic Germans (Volksdeutsche) in those territories were persecuted. The Nazis negotiated a number of population transfers with Joseph Stalin and others with Benito Mussolini so that both Germany and the other country would increase their ethnic homogeneity. However, these population transfers were not sufficient to appease the demands of the Nazis. The Heim ins Reich rhetoric of the Nazis over the continued disjoint status of enclaves such as Danzig and East Prussia was an agitating factor in the politics leading up to World War II, and is considered by many to be among the major causes of Nazi aggressiveness and thus the war. Adolf Hitler used these issues as a pretext for waging wars of aggression against Czechoslovakia and Poland. =Rhineland= On 7 March 1936, Hitler sent a small expeditionary force into the demilitarized Rhineland. This was a clear violation of the Treaty of Versailles (1919, official end of World War I), and as such, France and Britain were within their rights, via the Treaty, to oust the German forces. British public opinion blocked any use of military force, thus preventing French action, as they were internally divided and would not act without British support. =Saar region= In 1933, a considerable number of anti-Nazi Germans fled to the Saar, as it was the only part of Germany left outside the Third Reich's control. As a result, anti-Nazi groups campaigned heavily for the Saarland to remain under control of League of Nations as long as Adolf Hitler ruled Germany. However, long-held sentiments against France remained entrenched, with very few sympathizing openly with France. When the 15-year-term was over, a plebiscite was held in the territory on 13 January 1935: 90.3% of those voting wished to join Germany. On 17 January 1935, the territory's re-union with Germany was approved by the League Council. On 1 March, Nazi Germany took over the region and appointed Josef B√ºrckel as Reichskommissar f√ºr die R√ºckgliederung des Saarlandes, \\"Imperial Commissioner for the re-union of Saarland\\". As the new Gau was extended to the Rhine, including the historic Palatinate, the region's name was changed again on 8 April 1940 to Gau Saarpfalz (Saar-Palatinate). After the Battle of France, the French d√©partement of Moselle was incorporated in the Reichsgau. =Anschluss= The Allies were, on paper, committed to upholding the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which specifically prohibited the union of Austria and Germany. This notwithstanding, the Anschluss was among the first major steps in the Austrian-born Adolf Hitler's long-desired creation of an empire including German-speaking lands and territories Germany had lost after World War I. The events of 12 March 1938, marked the culmination of historical cross-national pressures to unify the German populations of Austria and Germany under one nation. However, the 1938 Anschluss, regardless of its popularity, was enacted by Germany. Earlier, Hitler's Germany had provided support for the Austrian National Socialist Party (Austrian Nazi Party) in its bid to seize power from Austria's Austrofascist leadership. Fully devoted to remaining independent but amidst growing pressures, the chancellor of Austria, Kurt Schuschnigg, tried to hold a plebiscite. Although Schuschnigg expected Austria to vote in favour of maintaining autonomy, a well-planned coup d'√©tat by the Austrian Nazi Party of Austria's state institutions in Vienna took place on 11 March, prior to the vote. With power quickly transferred over to Germany, the Wehrmacht troops entered Austria to enforce the Anschluss. The Nazis held a plebiscite within the following month, where they received 99.73% of the vote. No fighting ever took place and the strongest voices against the annexation, particularly Fascist Italy, France and the United Kingdom (parties to the Stresa Front), were powerless or, in the case of Italy, appeased. =Czechoslovakia= The partition of Czechoslovakia from 1938 through 1939. German gains in purple (dark: Sudetenland, light: Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia) Sudetenland On 29 September 1938, Adolf Hitler, Neville Chamberlain, Benito Mussolini and √âdouard Daladier signed the Munich Agreement. The Czechoslovak government capitulated on September 30 and reluctantly agreed to abide by the agreement. The settlement gave Germany the Sudetenland starting October 10, and de facto control over the rest of Czechoslovakia as long as Hitler promised to go no further. Hitler and Chamberlain signed an additional resolution determining to resolve all future disputes between Germany and the United Kingdom through peaceful means. This is often confused with the Four- Power Munich Agreement itself, not least because most photographs of Chamberlain's return show him waving the paper containing the resolution, not the Munich Agreement itself. Without fortification which was built in Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia was now defenseless. On 5 October, Edvard Bene≈° resigned as President of Czechoslovakia, realising that the fall of Czechoslovakia was fait accompli. Following the outbreak of World War II, he would form a Czechoslovak government-in-exile in London. Invasion of the rest of Czechoslovakia Germany in 1939 before the start of World War II On 13 March 1939, Nazi armies entered Prague and proceeded to occupy the remainder of Bohemia and Moravia, which was transformed into a protectorate of the Reich. The eastern half of the country, Slovakia, became a separate pro- Nazi state, the Slovak Republic. Prime Minister Chamberlain felt betrayed by the Nazi seizure of Czechoslovakia, realising his policy of appeasement towards Hitler had failed, and immediately began to mobilize the British Empire's armed forces on a war footing. France did the same. Though no immediate action followed, Hitler's move on Poland in September started World War II in Europe. =Memel Territory= By late 1938, Lithuania had lost control over the situation in the Memel Territory. In the early hours of 23 March 1939, after a political ultimatum had made a Lithuanian delegation travel to Berlin, the Lithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Juozas Urb≈°ys and his German counterpart Joachim von Ribbentrop signed the Treaty of the Cession of the Memel Territory to Germany in exchange for a Lithuanian Free Zone in the port of Memel, using the facilities erected in previous years. World War II The Third Reich at its greatest extent, 1942 Territorial expansion of Germany proper from 1933 to 1941 as explained to Wehrmacht soldiers, a Nazi era map in German. =Poland= After invading Poland in 1939, Germany annexed the lands it was forced to give to a reformed Poland in 1919‚Äì1922 by the Treaty of Versailles, including the \\"Polish Corridor\\", West Prussia, the Province of Posen, and East Upper Silesia. The Volkstag of the Free City of Danzig voted to become a part of Germany again, although Poles and Jews were deprived of their voting rights and all non-Nazi political parties were banned. Parts of Poland that had not been part of Wilhelmine Germany were also incorporated into the Reich. Map of NS administrative division in 1944 Two decrees by Adolf Hitler (8 October and 12 October 1939) provided for the division of the annexed areas of Poland into the following administrative units: * Reichsgau Wartheland (initially Reichsgau Posen), which included the entire Pozna≈Ñ Voivodeship, most of the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Voivodeship, five counties of the Pomeranian Voivodeship, and the Dzia≈Çdowo/Soldau County of the Warsaw Voivodeship; *Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia (initially Reichsgau West Prussia), which consisted of the remaining area of the Pomeranian Voivodeship and the Free City of Danzig; * Ciechan√≥w District (Regierungsbezirk Zichenau), consisting of the five northern counties of Warsaw Voivodeship (P≈Çock, P≈Ço≈Ñsk, Sierpc, Ciechan√≥w, and M≈Çawa), which became a part of East Prussia; * Katowice District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz), or unofficially East Upper Silesia (Ost-Oberschlesien), which included Sosnowiec, Bƒôdzin, Chrzan√≥w, and Zawiercie Counties, and parts of Olkusz and ≈ªywiec Counties. These territories had an area of and a population of 10,000,000 people. The remainder of the Polish territory was annexed by the Soviet Union (c. 52%; see Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact) or made into the German-controlled General Government occupation zone. After the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Bia≈Çystok Voivodeship, which included the Bia≈Çystok, Bielsk Podlaski, Grajewo, ≈Åom≈ºa, Sok√≥≈Çka, Volkovysk, and Grodno Counties, was \\"attached to\\" (not incorporated into) East Prussia, while East Galicia was added to the General Government. =Alsace-Lorraine= After the invasion of France in 1940, Germany annexed the d√©partements of Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin and Moselle (Alsace-Lorraine). The German government never negotiated or declared a formal annexation, however, in order to preserve the possibility of an agreement with the West. =Eupen and Malmedy= See Eupen-Malmedy =Luxembourg= Luxembourg was invaded and occupied by German Forces in June 1940. It was formally annexed to Germany in August 1942. =Parts of Yugoslavia= From: History of Slovenia \\"After Yugoslavia fell, Germany, Italy, and Hungary each annexed parts of Slovenia, the largest part being Lower Styria which was annexed to the \\"Ostmark\\" (Nazi German Austria).\\" =South Tyrol= See Annexation of South Tyrol to Nazi Germany and Italian Social Republic. = Recognition = All areas that were incorporated into Nazi Germany between 1937 and 8 May 1945 were de facto repudiated at the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences, and were therefore non-issues in the post-war division of Nazi Germany. One exception was Memelland, the incorporation of which at the end of March 1939 was recognised by the UK and France, but not by the US. Territorial changes after World War II Allied occupation zones in Germany, 1947 As it became evident that the Allies were going to defeat Nazi Germany decisively, the question arose as to how to redraw the borders of Central and Eastern European countries after the war. In the context of those decisions, the problem arose of what to do about ethnic minorities within the redrawn borders. The territorial changes at the end of World War II were part of negotiated agreements between the victorious Allies to redraw national borders and arrange for deportation of all Germans that were east of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line. The Allies occupied Germany, but the Western allies and Soviet Union formed separate governments covering specific parts of Germany (West Germany, as well as West Berlin, and East Germany). The Germanies and West Berlin reunified in 1990. =The Yalta Conference= The final decision to move Poland's boundary westward was made by the US, Britain and the Soviets at the Yalta Conference, shortly before the end of the war. The precise location of the border was left open; the western Allies also accepted in general the principle of the Oder River as the future western border of Poland and of population transfer as the way to prevent future border disputes. The open question was whether the border should follow the eastern or western Neisse rivers, and whether Stettin, the traditional seaport of Berlin, should remain German or be included in Poland. Originally, Germany was to retain Stettin while the Poles were to annex East Prussia with K√∂nigsberg. . Eventually, however, Stalin decided that he wanted K√∂nigsberg as a year-round warm water port for the Soviet Navy and argued that the Poles should receive Stettin instead. The wartime Polish government in exile had little to say in these decisions. Key points of the meeting that are relevant to the territorial changes of Germany are as follows: *There was an agreement that the priority would be the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany. After the war, Germany would be split into four occupied zones, with a quadripartite occupation of Berlin as well, prior to unification of Germany. *Stalin agreed to let France have the fourth occupation zone in Germany and Austria, carved out from the British and American zones. France would also be granted a seat in the Allied Control Council. *Germany would undergo demilitarization and denazification. *The status of Poland was discussed, but was complicated by the fact that Poland was at this time under the control of the Red Army. It was agreed to reorganize the Provisionary Polish Government that had been set up by the Red Army through the inclusion of other groups such as the Polish Provisional Government of National Unity and to have democratic elections. This effectively excluded the Polish government-in-exile that had evacuated in 1939. *The Polish eastern border would follow the Curzon Line, and Poland would receive substantial territorial compensation in the west from Germany, although the exact border was to be determined at a later time. *A \\"Committee on Dismemberment of Germany\\" was to be set up. The purpose was to decide whether Germany was to be divided into several nations, and if so, what borders and inter-relationships the new German states were to have. =The Potsdam Conference= At the Potsdam Conference the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union placed the German territories within the 1937 Nazi Germany borders east of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line, and with the exception of parts of East Prussia, as formally under Polish administrative control (These were referred to by the Polish communist government as the \\"Western Territories\\" or \\"Regained Territories\\"). It was anticipated that a final peace treaty would follow shortly and either confirm this border or determine whatever alterations might be agreed upon. Northern East Prussia and Memelland were placed under Soviet administrative control. The 1919 Versailles Treaty created Free City of Danzig was also placed under Polish administration. The German population east of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line was forcibly expelled. At the end of the conference, the Three Heads of Government agreed on the following actions: The Oder‚ÄìNeisse line * Issuance of a statement of aims of the occupation of Germany by the Allies: demilitarization, denazification, democratization and decartelization. (see also: The industrial plans for Germany) * Division of Germany and Austria respectively into four occupation zones (earlier agreed in principle at Yalta), and the similar division of each's capital, Berlin and Vienna, into four and five sectors (one quadripartite sector), respectively. * Reversion of all German annexations in Europe after 1937, among these were Sudetenland, Alsace-Lorraine, Austria, the westmost parts of Poland, and others. * Germany's eastern border was to be shifted westwards to the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line, effectively reducing Germany in size by approximately 25% compared to its 1937 borders. The territories east of the new border comprised East Prussia, all of Silesia (except for its westernmost part around the city of G√∂rlitz), the eastern part of Brandenburg, and most of Pomerania (including former Grenzmark Posen-West Prussia). These areas included large urban centres such as Stettin, Breslau, Landsberg an der Warthe and so on. * Expulsion of the German populations remaining beyond the new eastern borders of Germany, and ethnically German denaturalised citizens of other states such Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia. France, which had not participated in the Potsdam conference, took its liberties to dismiss this point and therefore refused to absorb any expellees in its zone of occupation.Cf. the report \\"Vor 50 Jahren: Der 15. April 1950. Vertriebene finden eine neue Heimat in Rheinland-Pfalz\\" of the Central Archive of the State of Rhineland-Palatinate on the first expellees arriving in that state in 1950 to be resettled from other German states. Finalization of the Polish-German border West Germany, East Germany, and the Saarland, 1949. The problem with the status of these territories was that the concluding document of the Potsdam Conference in 1945 was not a legally binding treaty, but a memorandum between the USSR, the US and the UK. It regulated the issue of the eastern German border, which was to be the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line, but the final article of the memorandum said that the final decisions concerning Germany were to be subject to a separate peace treaty. Based upon this interpretation of the Potsdam Agreement, the CDU controlled German government maintained that the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line was completely unacceptable and subject to negotiation. Also the Social Democrats of the SPD initially refused to accept the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line. Thus, the official German government position on the status of areas vacated by settled German communities east of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse rivers was that the areas were \\"temporarily under Polish (or [Soviet]) administration.\\" Between 1970 and 1990, the West German political establishment gradually recognised the \\"facts on the ground\\" and accepted clauses in the Treaty on the Final Settlement, whereby Germany renounced all claims to territory east of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line. In the Treaty of Warsaw (1970; ratified in 1972) West Germany recognized the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line as Poland's western border and renounced any present and future territorial claims; this was reaffirmed by both German states in the 1990 Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany as a pre-condition for re-union. The treaty was ratified in 1991 by the united Germany. United Germany and Poland then finally settled the issue of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse border by the German‚ÄìPolish Border Treaty in November 1990. This ended the legal limbo which meant that for 45 years, people on both sides of the border could not be sure whether the status quo reached in 1945 might be changed at some future date. = Belgium = The \\"Working Party on Provisional Adjustments to the Western Frontiers of Germany\\" approved in 1949 the provisional transfer of containing 500 inhabitants to Belgium:International Boundary Study Office of the Geographer Bureau of Intelligence and Research #Bildchen (returned in 1956) #Lichtenbusch (returned in 1956) #Fringshaus ‚Äî roads between Roetgen and Fringshaus, Fringshaus and Lammersdorf, Fringshaus and Konzen (first two returned in 1956) #Leykoul (eastern part returned in 1956) #Elsenborn #Losheim (only the village returned in 1956) #Hemmeres (returned in 1956) As part of the 1956 treaty, in exchange for the territory ceded by Germany, Belgium ceded to Germany its territory north of the Fringshaus roads and bounded by the Vennbahn. The detached territory, in 1956 containing 704 inhabitants including refugees, was, prior to its 1956 dissolution and partition between West Germany and Belgium, ruled as an independent territory by Belgian Army Major General Paul Bolle, who enjoyed dictatorial powers.Autocrat's Adieu Time Magazine, 8 October 1956. = Netherlands = Despite the more extensive annexation proposals of the Bakker-Schut Plan, only a few border modifications were implemented. On 23 April 1949, Dutch troops occupied an area of , the largest parts of which were Elten (near Emmerich am Rhein) and Selfkant. Many other small border changes were executed, mostly in the vicinity of Arnhem and Dinxperlo. At that time, these areas were inhabited by a total of almost 10,000 people. Starting in March 1957, West Germany negotiated with the Netherlands for the return of these areas. The negotiations led to an agreement (; short: Ausgleichsvertrag, i.e. treaty of settlementCf. Bundesgesetzblatt (Federal Law Gazette), part III, no. 181-1.) made in The Hague on 8 April 1960, in which Germany agreed to pay DEM 280 million for the return of Elten, Selfkant, and Suderwick, as Wiedergutmachung. The territory was returned to Germany on 1 August 1963, except for one small hill (about ) near Wyler village, called Duivelsberg/Wylerberg which was annexed by the Netherlands. = France = Starting on 16 February 1946 France disentangled the Saar area and established the separate Saar Protectorate, further attaching parts of the Prussian Rhine Province and the Bavarian Palatinate (Saarpfalz). Like the former eastern territories of Germany the Saar area was out of the jurisdiction of the Allied Control Council for Germany and thus no part of Allied-occupied Germany. However, unlike the eastern territories the domestic Saar population was not expelled by the controlling French. With effect of 1 January 1957 the Saar Protectorate declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany, as provided by its Grundgesetz (constitution) art. 23 (Little Reunification), thus becoming the new federal state of Saarland.

PDQ System Most ASMP games share in common the PDQ (Prose Descriptive Qualities) system, a rules-light game engine that has three different levels of task resolution for any situation, in order to let players resolve encounters in as much or as little detail as desired. The mechanism is to generate a random number or roll, add a freeform stat or set of stats, and compare to a difficulty number‚Äîeither a fixed difficulty number or the opponent's roll. In conflicts, the amount which you beat another character's roll by is the amount of damage or failure ranks (see below). Stats are rated in five named ranks: Poor [-2], Average [+0], Good [+2], Expert [+4], and Master [+6]. Conflicts result in the accumulation of either \\"failure ranks\\" (which recover at the end of the contest) or \\"damage ranks\\" (which may take longer to heal). Each point of either type means that the loser must choose a stat to downgrade by one rank. So if you lose a conflict roll by 3, you must lower three stats each by one rank, or one stat by three ranks (with a minimum of Poor: -2). You can choose any stat to take your damage in‚Äîi.e. you can downgrade your \\"Accounting\\" quality based on a hit in a fight. When you can't lower your stats any lower (i.e. a hit when all stats are at Poor [-2]), then you have lost the contest.

It is said to be a loose retelling of Romeo and Juliet, itself a European version of many tales of star-crossed lovers in a variety of cultures and eras. In this story, the children of the gods of fire and water fall in love and fight to stay together in the face of adversity. Story Long ago both Glaucus (named Oceanus in the English adaptation), the God of Water, and Themis (named Hyperia in the English adaptation), the Goddess of Fire, lived as one. However, Argon (named Algorac in the English adaptation), Lord of the Winds, grew jealous of Glaucus and Themis's love and turned them against one another by lying to each that the other was plotting to overthrow them. The war between Water and Fire began. After both sides were nearly destroyed, the highest god of them all intervened and struck down Algorac, tearing loose his eye (the source of his power), and damned him to the deepest abyss of the oceans, entrusting the eye to Glacus and keeping the seas calm. Themis at that same time created a Holy Flame near the sea that would, in her opinion, keep the seas calm so that her children of Fire would live forever and never be extinguished. From that point on, the two elemental siblings were forever parted to keep peace between them. Years later, Prince Syrius (voiced by Tony Oliver in the U.S. release), the son of Glacus, becomes heir to the Sea Kingdom and is given the Eye of Algorac to protect. Princess Malta, the daughter of Themis, also becomes the new heir to the Fire Kingdom, being charged with guarding the Holy Flame at the edge of the sea each night until her sixteenth birthday, when she will become queen. As Syrius plays with his little brother Teak (named Bibble in the English adaptation), he wanders off into the forbidden waters of the Sea Kingdom. He follows a bright light which leads him above the surface of the water for the first time. There Syrius and Malta see each other for the first time. As Syrius climbs on to a rock to get a closer look, the flame burns brightly and forces Syrius back into the water where he falls unconscious. Teak finds him and rescues him from being pulled into the whirlpool where Algorac is kept. As Syrius is made ruler of the Sea Kingdom, a jealous and bullying Japanese giant salamander named Mabuse (named Mugwug in the English adaptation), attempts to take the eye of Algorac away from Syrius and get the creatures of the deep to make him the king of the sea, but Syrius deals with him easily and sends him flying. Malta returns to the Holy Flame, accompanied by her friend Piale, but becomes agitated as she worries the strange boy or one of the monsters from the sea that her mother has warned her about will appear. The next night Syrius returns to see her. They introduce themselves and after realizing they mean each other no harm, they begin to fall in love. Syrius tells her all about life under the sea, which Malta finds fascinating. As the sun begins to rise, however, Syrius must return to the sea, because the children of the water will die if they are touched by sunlight. They bid each other farewell until the next night and Malta gives him a kiss. Syrius and Malta are extremely happy throughout the following day, which doesn't go unnoticed by Teak, Piale and Themis. As Syrius and Malta play in Malta's secret garden that night, Teak journeys through the forbidden waters and sees the two dancing with each other. Unfortunately, a group of gigantic, deadly jellyfish take the opportunity to attack the sea kingdom while Syrius is away. Syrius sees the calm waters turn rough and goes to fight, but it is too late. Teak, who was hurt by the jellyfish, lashes out at his brother and reveals he knew where he was. After asking Moelle, the oldest and wisest sea turtle in the ocean, for some advice, he is asked to forget about Malta. Malta is upset when Syrius doesn't return the following evening. Mabuse tries to convince Syrius that the burden of the Eye is too heavy and he will gladly take it from him, but Syrius refuses and instead decides to see Malta again. Mabuse, deducing that he is hiding something, follows him. In the Fire Kingdom, Themis sees how sad her daughter is and reminds her that during an eclipse coming in five days, she will be the next Queen of the Fire Clan. Malta is heartbroken and begs her mother to let her keep taking care of the sacred flame, to which her mother refuses. Syrius returns that night much to Malta's happiness, but Piale catches them kissing and attacks Syrius. She flies off, heartbroken. Malta, beginning to realize they can never be together, performs a farewell dance for Syrius and throws herself into the Holy Flame. Refusing to believe what she says, Syrius jumps into the flame after her, but they fall out. Before they can both hit the surface of the water, they land on top of Moelle, who brings them safely back to shore. He now understands the love Syrius has for Malta. Moelle tells them the story of how water and fire no longer lived together as one, but when he's done, he sees Malta and Syrius embracing, surviving the amount of heat from the nearby flame. Moelle tells them there may be a way for them to stay together‚Äîit is rumored that somewhere in the heavens there is a star where fire and water live together. During the same eclipse where Malta is to be made queen, strange pink flowers of fire and water known as Klaesco blossoms (called Kalea flowers in the English adaptation), on Mobius Hill (called the Hill of Elysium in the English adaptation), burst into bloom and release white spores that fly up into the sky, making their way to that star. Unfortunately, Mabuse overhears everything and after making himself known to the \\"traitors\\", swims off to tell King Glaucus. Moelle chases after him before he can tell Malta and Syrius where Mobius Hill is. To make matters worse, the Holy Flame, left unattended too long, goes out. Malta knows without the sacred flame, her mother will lose her youth and most likely kill Syrius for what he has done. As she sobs on his shoulder, Piale, who had been watching the whole time, promises to distract everyone while Malta and Syrius escape to Mobius Hill. Piale declares her love for Malta and becomes the Holy Flame herself. Themis and the Fire Children notice the change in the flame, however. When they fly down from the palace to see it, the Queen discovers Piale's sacrifice and sends the Fire Children to bring back Malta. They almost succeed in recapturing her but Syrius fights back until they are cornered by both Glaucus and Themis. They confront each other and force Malta and Syrius apart. Both of them imprison the two children as punishment for betraying their own kind and so they can not elope together. Three small sprites free Malta and distract the guards so she may escape to Mobius Hill. Teak visits Syrius in prison and unsuccessfully tries to get him out. Malta wanders through a desert for days, encountering the strange creatures of Sand Riddle Hill who transport her to Mobius Hill for answering their riddle. Syrius keeps calling Malta's name, earning the sympathy of most of the creatures of the sea. Mabuse comes with a dangerous idea for Teak to get Syrius out‚Äîsteal the eye of Algorac and bring it to his prison. Once free he will attack and destroy most of the kingdom, allowing Syrius to escape. Teak doesn't like this plan but thinking he has no choice goes to tell Syrius, unaware of Mabuse's true intentions to finally take the eye for himself. Syrius refuses to hand over the eye, but when Teak says being king matters more to him than his fire child, Syrius tells him that he doesn't deserve to be king. He tells him to return the eye to Glaucus instead and tell him he was never worthy of being his heir, hoping perhaps Glaucus will let him go. On the way there, Teak is ambushed by Mabuse and his gang and he takes the eye for himself. Now declaring himself king, they drunkenly celebrate until Teak is able to escape and take back the eye. Teak makes it to Glaucus' temple but the guards refuse to let him in, believing the eye is a fake. In anger, Teak heads to the forbidden waters to give the eye to Algorac instead. After approaching the deadly chasm, Teak changes his mind and tries to return to Syrius, but the eye is overcome by Algorac's power and pulls Teak into the whirlpool. Algorac is unleashed and he begins to destroy the ocean. The world above is affected as well; Malta is almost sucked into a maelstrom that forms below Mobius Hill. Glaucus battles with Algorac and defeats him for good. Syrius escapes before the dungeon before it collapses on him, and finds Teak, who is mortally wounded. Teak tells him to go to Malta before he dies. Meanwhile, on Mobius Hill, the eclipse begins and the Klaesco blossoms start to bloom. Malta tries to stop all of the spores from floating away but it is too late. Malta falls to the ground sobbing, believing Syrius had lied to her about returning. During the eclipse, Malta is transformed into the new Fire Queen. Syrius desperately searches for Malta on land but falls off a cliff and loses his sight when he hits the ground. When he finally reaches Malta, the Fire Children present are astounded that the Water Child kept his promise. A heartbroken and haughty Malta tells him the flowers are gone and refuses to speak to him ever again. Syrius still calls out for her and runs to her as the eclipse ends. Malta begs him to go back but it is too late. The sunlight kills Syrius and Malta begins to weep over his body. The Fire Children and Themis watch as she mourns the loss of her love. She says that they will never be apart again, and carries him into the water, where she too dies. Themis is heartbroken when Glaucus appears out of the sea with their bodies. He reminds the world that fire and water were indeed once one, and sends Malta and Syrius up to the faraway heavens to let their love create that world once more. In an epilogue, Moelle appears saying that fire and water now live again in peace on this planet, but he passes on the story of Malta and Syrius, and how they now watch over the world from their own star in the night sky.

Since the start of European colonization, the Rama population has declined as a result of disease, conflict, and loss of territory. In recent years, however, the Rama population has increased to around 2,000 individuals. A majority of the population lives on the island of Rama Cay, which is located in the Bluefields Lagoon. Additional small Rama communities are dispersed on the mainland from Bluefields to Greytown. The Rama are one of three main indigenous groups on Nicaragua‚Äôs Caribbean coast. Due to centuries of colonial suppression the Rama people‚Äôs native language is facing extinction. Language revitalization efforts have been made in recent years and have achieved early success in Rama communities. Rama territory is currently being threatened by the Nicaraguan government and foreign investors, who are seeking to develop a transoceanic canal and to extract resources from the region. Rama communities The vast majority of the indigenous Rama population inhabit the island of Rama Cay. Sumu Kaat, Tiktik Kaanu, Wiring Cay, Monkey Point, Bangkukuk Taik, Corn River, Punta Gorda, and Cane Creek are recognized as predominantly Rama communities on the mainland. History The Rama are descendants of a combination of indigenous communities that occupied the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua at the time of European contact. Following Spanish colonization of the region, British pirates formed an alliance with the Miskito in order to wield indirect control of the Caribbean coast. The Miskito assisted the British in pillaging Spanish ships and resisting Spanish control of the region in exchange for guns and other resources that allowed them to exert control over other indigenous groups like the Rama. According to Rama oral tradition, the Miskito gifted the island of Rama Cay to them in the 18th century in recognition of their help in fighting the Teribe people of Costa Rica. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean coast came to rely upon private investment and enterprises for socio-economic stability. In adherence to socialist policies, the Sandinista- dominated Nicaraguan government in the 1980s sought to nationalize all private institutions, which resulted in a reduction of private investment on the Caribbean coast. Many indigenous groups resented the government for its interference in the indigenous economy and regional autonomy. The Rama were one of many indigenous groups to join the Contras, a group of anticommunist guerrillas, some of whom were backed by the CIA, dedicated to fighting the Sandinista regime. As a result of the Nicaraguan Revolution, many Rama were displaced from their homes and traditional lands. In an effort to return peace to the Caribbean coast the Nicaraguan government established the Constitution of 1987 and the Autonomy Statue. These government initiatives recognized indigenous existence in Nicaragua, the right of indigenous peoples to determine their own ethnic identity, and the right of indigenous communities to offer intercultural education in their traditional language. Due to political conflict in the nation, the regulation terms of the Autonomy Statue were not ratified until 2003. Implementation of the Autonomy Statue continues to remain a challenge, because the national government and regional councils disagree over the level of autonomy the Caribbean communities should possess. Lifestyle The Rama culture is dependent upon traditional self-sufficient strategies in order to obtain desired substances. While some Rama engage in small-scale commercial fishing, a majority of the population still practices traditional occupations such as subsistence fishing and subsistence farming. Mutual assistance is an important practice in Rama communities and is relied upon for cultural and economic stability. Sexual division of labor exists among the Rama, with males responsible for hunting, fishing, and planting, while the females partake in gathering and domestic duties. Prior to the arrival of missionaries, the Rama population on Rama Cay reportedly lived in homes lacking exterior and interior walls. Poor soil conditions in the rainforest do not allow for extensive agriculture, so like other indigenous populations in the region the Rama cultivate small fields along river banks. Crops harvested by the Rama include bananas, plantains, corn, rice, beans, coconuts, pineapple, breadfruit, and pejibaye. Fishing contributes significantly to the Rama diet, which consists of oysters, cockles, freshwater shrimp, coppermouth, and snook. Hunting is practiced primarily on the mainland where important game animals such as white-lipped peccary, tapir, and deer can be found. The Rama people are commonly known for their skill in crafting dories and for their reputation of being the best navigators on the coast. Religion In 1847 German Moravian missionaries started work in Bluefields, Nicaragua. The missionaries worked with the different ethnic groups and became a firmly established colonial institution on the Caribbean coast. The first Moravian mission was established on Rama Cay in 1858 and contributed to the shift away from traditional practices and the use of the Rama language. The Rama people initially resisted the efforts of the missionaries because the Church's values conflicted with traditional Rama culture; however, as they dissociated from their traditional identity, the Rama became more receptive to outside influences. Today the Rama people predominantly practice in the Moravian Church. Individuals in the southeastern portion of Nicaragua alone make up 96% of the membership of the Moravian Church in Nicaragua. Language The Rama language is part of the Chibchan family and is considered moribund since less than 30 elders can still speak the language fluently. Playing an important role in colonizing the region, the Moravian Church was a major force behind the loss of the Rama Language on Rama Cay. The Church taught English to the natives and influenced the formation of a negative attitude towards traditional speakers, resulting in the reference to Rama as the \\"Tiger language\\". As a result of this animosity, the population that inhabits Rama Cay today speaks a unique version of Rama-Creole which is similar to Creole English. Only two individuals are thought to still speak traditional Rama on the island. The Rama language had previously been preserved in mainland communities; however, modern developments are threatening the loss of traditional customs and the language. In 1985 the Rama Language Program (RLP) was launched in response to requests to \\"save the Rama language\\". Initial efforts to locate and communicate with native speakers proved challenging for linguists because the inhabitants of Rama Cay still rejected any use of the Rama language. In recent years language revitalization efforts have achieved some success, as the Rama people move increasingly to associate their traditional language with their identity. This movement by the indigenous Rama to reclaim their language has led many speakers to label the language as \\"rescued\\". Status Nicaragua is one of the poorest nations in the Western Hemisphere, and Nicaragua's Caribbean coast suffers from an exceptional amount of economic underdevelopment and poverty. Rama who reside in urban areas such as Bluefields suffer from discrimination and unemployment due to their ethnic identity. Unemployment levels are especially high for women and youth in this Caribbean coast region. =Land rights= The Rama people currently occupy the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region (RACCS). Both this region and the North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region (RACCN) were established with the 1987 Constitution and Autonomy law. These statutes recognize collective forms of indigenous land ownership and establish terms for natural resource management. Implementation of indigenous autonomy has proved to be difficult due to internecine conflict and lack of government support. The RACCN and RACCS make up approximately half of the nation's landmass, while Caribbean coast inhabitants make up only ten percent of the nation's population. Social disruption resulting from the civil war in the 1980s has advanced colonization along Nicaragua's agricultural frontier. Former combantants and mestizo families displaced by the war are migrating east to renew their former lives and engage in subsistence farming. Due to the poor quality of rainforest soil and increasing social unrest on the Pacific coast, more individuals move east each year and come into contact with indigenous communities. Much of central and eastern Nicaragua is protected rainforest, yet the government lacks the resources to halt the extensive environment destruction associated with the recent migrations. The advancing agricultural frontier is responsible for large amounts of deforestation and ecological devastation in the region. Interoceanic canal The Nicaraguan government has long sought out investors to finance the building of a Nicaraguan interoceanic canal. The Chinese company Hong Kong Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Co Ltd (HKND) was contracted in 2013 to build the canal for the cost of $40‚Äì$50 billion. Investors and the Nicaraguan government hope that the new canal will rival the Panama Canal and will be able to accommodate larger size ships and the growing demand for inter-ocean passage. The canal is expected to run from Punta Gordon on the Caribbean coast to Brito on the Pacific coast, traveling through Lake Nicaragua. Construction for the canal began in December 2014 and the project is expected to be completed by 2019. Indigenous populations are protesting the building of this canal on the grounds that they were not consulted prior to a contract being negotiated with HKND by the Nicaraguan government. Construction of the canal would require the relocation of 80% of the indigenous Rama population and would destroy traditional communal life for many other indigenous communities. International groups are protesting construction of the canal because they fear the environmental impact that the project will have on Nicaragua's endangered species and delicate ecosystem. Despite controversy surrounding the project, the Nicaraguan government is going ahead with the canal's construction, hoping the infrastructure and revenue that the canal brings in will lift the nation out of poverty.

He played college football at the University of Missouri. Early years Fellows attended Washington High School, where he lettered in football, track and basketball. In football, he was a two-way player, as a running back and safety. He helped his team win the Northern Indiana Conference championship in 1975 and 1976. As a senior, he received South Bend Tribune Offensive Player of the Year and All-State offensive/defensive back honors. He was named All-Conference in track and basketball. In 1977, he won the IHSAA 120 yards high hurdles state championship. In 2014, he was inducted into the Indiana Football Hall of Fame. College career Fellows moved on to Butler Community College, where he played as a cornerback for two seasons. He also ran the hurdles. He transferred to the University of Missouri after his sophomore season. As a junior, midway through the 1979 season, he was converted into a wide receiver, posting 4 receptions for 44 yards and no touchdowns. As a senior, he led the Big Eight Conference in receiving with 587 yards on 33 receptions (led the team), while also catching 4 touchdowns (led the team). Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Fellows was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the seventh round (173rd overall) of the 1981 NFL draft, with the intention of playing him at cornerback. By the eleventh game of his rookie season, he was being used on the nickel defense. In 1982, he played right corner on obvious passing downs, with starter Dennis Thurman being moved to safety. He also led the team in punt and kickoff returns. In 1983, he played nickel cornerback over former first-round draft choice Rod Hill, while posting 5 interceptions (second on the team). Against the New Orleans Saints, he returned a blocked field goal for a game winning 62-yard touchdown, the first such return by a Cowboy in 19 years. He returned an interception for a 58-yard touchdown against the Minnesota Vikings. He also tied a team record with 43 kickoff returns. Fellows was part of an opportunistic Cowboys secondary that earned the nickname \\"Thurman's Thieves\\", because of the amount of plays and turnovers they generated. In 1984, after Thurman made the permanent switch to safety, he became the starter at right cornerback opposite Everson Walls, and posted 3 interceptions. He returned a blocked field goal for a 62-yard touchdown against the New Orleans Saints, the first such return for a Cowboy in 19 years. He had 2 interceptions, including one returned for a 58-yard touchdown and 4 kickoff returns for 109 yards against the Minnesota Vikings. In 1985, he struggled with a sprained knee he suffered in the first quarter of the season opener against the Washington Redskins, which caused him to miss 3 games and 2 starts, eventually requiring offseason surgery. He still managed to make 4 interceptions (tied for third on the team) and 20 passes defensed (second on the team). In 1986, he finished first on the team with 15 passes defensed and second with 5 interceptions, including a 34-yard return for a touchdown against the St. Louis Cardinals. He had 4 turnovers (2 interceptions and 2 fumble recoveries) against the Chicago Bears. On August 2, 1987, after being involved in a contract holdout and the Cowboys needing help at wide receiver, the team felt they had depth at cornerback after drafting Ron Francis, so he was traded to the Los Angeles Raiders in exchange for Rod Barksdale. =Los Angeles Raiders= In 1987, Fellows was the team's nickel cornerback, appearing in 12 games with 2 starts. He was waived on August 29, 1988, but was re-signed after Terry McDaniel was lost for the year with a broken leg in the second game of the season. He appeared in 14 games with 10 starts at left cornerback, registering 2 interceptions and 2 fumble recoveries. He was not re-signed after the season. Personal life Fellows married wife Debra in 2002 and founded the Stars for Life Foundation, a nonprofit aimed at serving Native American communities suffering from addiction, diabetes and suicide. It now educates the public on the long-term dangers of impact sports. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2015.

It is found in Asia, Australia, and North America, where it grows on the ground in open woods. Its name, derived from the same Latin root as cranium, alludes to its resemblance to an animal's brain. The skull-shaped fruit body is broad by tall and white to tan. Initially smooth, the skin (peridium) develops wrinkles and folds as it matures, cracking and flaking with age. The peridium eventually sloughs away, exposing a powdery yellow-brown to greenish-yellow spore mass (the gleba). The puffball is edible when the gleba is still white and firm, before it matures to become yellow-brown and powdery. Mature specimens have been used in the traditional or folk medicines of China, Japan, and the Ojibwe as a hemostatic or wound dressing agent. Several bioactive compounds have been isolated and identified from the brain puffball. Taxonomy The species was first described as Bovista craniiformis by Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1832. Elias Fries transferred it to the then newly circumscribed genus Calvatia in 1849, setting Calvatia craniiformis as the type and only species. Scott Bates and colleagues suggest that the name is synonymous with Lycoperdon delicatum published by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1873 (not the L. delicatum published by Berkeley in 1854), as is Lycoperdon missouriense published by William Trelease in 1891.Bates et al. (2009), p. 170. The form C. craniiformis f. gardneri, published by Yosio Kobayasi in 1932 (originally Lycoperdon gardneri Berk. 1875), since been elevated to the distinct species Calvatia gardneri. In their 1962 monograph on North American Calvatia, mycologists Sanford Myron Zeller and Alexander H. Smith set C. craniiformis as the type species of the stirps (a grouping of related species) Craniiformis, containing species with a large sterile base and a persistent cottony gleba. Other species they included in this stirps were C. umbrina, C. diguetti, C. lycoperdoides, C. rubroflava, C. ochrogleba, C. excipuliformis (since transferred by some authorities to Handkea), and C. elata. Calvatia craniiformis is commonly known as the \\"brain- shaped puffball\\" or the \\"skull-shaped puffball\\". The specific epithet craniiformis derives from the Ancient Greek words cranion, meaning \\"brain\\", and forma, \\"a form\\". Description Cluster of fruit bodies found in New Zealand The fruit bodies of Calvatia craniiformis grow to dimensions of tall by wide, and have a form ranging from pear-shaped, to flattened-spherical, to obovate (roughly egg-shaped), to tunicate (like an inverted cone). At the bottom is a thick, often crumpled base attached to a cord-like rhizomorph, which is often encrusted with surrounding soil. The rhizomorphs are well developed, and when cut into longitudinal section, reveal three distinct tissues: an outer cortex, a subcortical layer, and a central core. The thin and fragile exoperidium (the outer layer of \\"skin\\") is whitish-gray to gray, and initially smooth before becoming areolate (divided by cracks into discrete areas). The base extends up one-third to one-half way into the puffball (where it becomes the columnella) tapering to a point. The gleba is initially whitish, and then yellow-green, and finally brownish-green in older specimens with mature spores. Spores are spherical, hyaline (translucent), and measure 2.5‚Äì3.4 Œºm in diameter. They are thick-walled with a short pedicel (a tubelike extension), and are ornamented with tiny spines (verrucae) that are roughly equidistant from each other. Capillitial threads are long, hyaline, and branched, measuring 2.4‚Äì4 Œºm thick. They are septate and occasionally have pits on their walls. The exoperidium comprises thick-walled, inflated hyphae mixed with sphaerocysts (spherical cells), while the endoperidium is made of tightly interwoven, thick-walled hyphae. In the rhizomorphs, the hyphae in the central core are several times as thick as those in the surrounding subcortex. Spores and capillitial threads Using light microscopy, the spores of Calvatia craniiformis are generally indistinguishable from those of C. rubroflava and C. gigantea; electron microscopy reveals that each has distinctive spore ornamentation. C. craniiformis features small, well-separated verrucae (wartlike projections) up to 0.2 Œºm tall with rounded tips. In comparison, C. gigantea has larger verrucae (up to 0.4 Œºm tall) that are more irregularly arranged. =Development= Fruit bodies arise from the tips or the lateral branches or rhizomorphs. New fruit bodies are made of an exterior of thick hyphae similar to those found in the rhizomorph core; in contrast, the hyphae of the interior originate from the puffball's core. Unlike some other puffball species, the peridium does not differentiate into a distinct exoperidium and endoperidium; rather, the outer layer develops the features of a pseudoparenchyma (a tightly organised tissue where the tightly packed cells resemble plant parenchyma) as the radial and tangential hyphae become interweaved. In time, the peridium dries and falls off in flakes to expose the underlying gleba. =Similar species= The brain-like surface folds and mature olive-brown gleba are characteristic of Calvatia craniiformis, but younger puffballs that have not yet developed these characteristics may be difficult to identify to species. Another edible puffball, C. cyathiformis (lilac puffball) grows to similar dimensions but has gleba that is purple- brown when mature. Calvatia fragilis is smaller and pink or purple mature gleba. C. bicolor is a smaller, rounder puffball that could be confused with younger specimens of C. craniiformis, but the former species has more coarsely ornamented spores, and lacks a distinct subgleba.Bates et al. (2009), p. 168. Handkea utriformis is roughly similar in appearance to C. craniiformis, but unlike the latter it develops a cavernous opening to reveal an olive-brown gleba, and has distinct slits in its capillitial threads.Bates et al. (2009), p. 171. Uses Calvatia craniiformis is edible when the gleba is firm and white, unlike the pictured specimen. Calvatia craniiformis is an edible species. Young puffballs with a firm, white gleba have a mild odor and pleasant taste. Early 20th-century mycologist Charles McIlvaine noted over a century ago that \\"the slightest change to yellow makes it bitter.\\" Versatile in cooking, the puffball absorbs flavors well. In the United States, the Ojibwe used the powdery gleba as a hemostatic agent to staunch the flow of nosebleeds: the spore powder was inhaled through the nostrils. It is now known that this practice can lead to the pulmonary disease lycoperdonosis, which causes symptoms similar to pneumonia. It is also used as a hemostatic agent in Chinese and Japanese folk medicines. Habitat and distribution Although Calvatia craniiformis is generally considered a saprobic species, in controlled laboratory conditions, an ectomycorrhizae between the fungus and American sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) was reported in a 1966 publication. A Chinese study showed that C. craniifromis would readily form mycorrhiza with poplar seedlings on unsterilized, but not on sterilized soil. Later research was unable to establish any similar association between C. craniiformis and Pinus ponderosa. Brain puffballs grow singly or in groups in fields and open woods, hardwood forests, and wet areas. In Asia, it has been recorded from China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, and South Korea. The brain puffball has been recorded from Australia. In North America, its range includes the eastern and southern United States, and Mexico. In Michigan, it is one of the few macrofungi found regularly in black locust plantations. Fruit bodies serve as a food source for several species of flies. Research Extracts of the puffball have strong antitumor activity in mouse models attributable to protein-bound polysaccharides, the compounds calvatan, craniformin, and a tautomer of rubroflavin. Calvatan is thought to act by stimulating the immune response, rather than by killing cells. Craniformin, originally reported in 1997, is an azoformamide compound. Three sterol compounds have been identified from the fungus: ergosta-4,6,8(14), 22-tetraene-3-one, ergosta-7,22-diene-3-ol, and ergosterol peroxide. Three azo- and azoxyformamides compounds have been isolated and identified from the puffball and tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of plants: 4-methoxybenzene-1-ONN-azoxyformamide, 4-methoxybenzene-1-azoformamide, and 4-hydroxybenzene-1-azoformamide. Only the first compound was significantly inhibitory, suggesting that the presence of the azoxy moiety is required for growth inhibition.

This complex is one of many cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complexes that are the \\"hearts of the cell-cycle control system\\" and govern the cell cycle and its progression. As its name would suggest, the cyclin-dependent kinase is only active and able to phosphorylate its substrates when it is bound by the corresponding cyclin. The Cyclin D/Cdk4 complex is integral for the progression of the cell from the Growth 1 phase to the Synthesis phase of the cell cycle, for the Start or G1/S checkpoint. Basic Mechanism Under non-dividing conditions (when the cell is in the G0 phase of the cell cycle), Retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is bound with the E2F transcription factor. Once Cdk4 is activated and is bound with Cyclin D, the Cyclin D/Cdk4 complex phosphorylates Retinoblastoma protein (pRb). Once the Retinoblastoma protein has been phosphorylated, E2F is released. The released E2F is then free to act as a transcription factor and it subsequently binds to DNA promoter regions and activates the expression of proteins required in the next stages of the cell cycle and in DNA replication. Specifically, E2F helps to activate Cyclin E and Cyclin A, which are constituents of other Cdk/Cyclin complexes and are involved in the DNA replication process and other downstream mitotic processes. Regulation There are multiple regulation points within this signaling pathway. First and foremost, under non-dividing conditions multiple proteins can inhibit the Cyclin D/Cdk4 complex by binding Cdk4 and inhibiting its association with Cyclin D. Primarily, this is accomplished by p27 but it can also be done by p16 and p21. However, this pathway is stimulated by the upstream binding of growth factors (GF), either from within the cell itself or from neighboring cells. Stimulation by growth factors activates any of a number of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) proteins. These receptor tyrosine kinases in turn phosphorylate and activate many other proteins, including Fos/Jun/Myc and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI-3-K). Fos/Jun/Myc helps to activate the Cyclin D/Cdk4 complex. Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase phosphorylates p27 (or p16 or p21) and SCF/Skp1. The phosphorylation of p27 inhibits p27's ability to bind Cdk4, thus freeing Cdk4 to associate with Cyclin D and form an active complex. SCF/Skp1 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase) helps to further inhibit p27 and thus further help activate the Cyclin D/Cdk4 complex. Also, p27 acts as an inhibitor of Cyclin E and Cyclin A. So, its inhibition also facilitates the activation of downstream mitotic processes, as noted above. There are also other peripheral regulators of the Cyclin D/Cdk4 complex. In megakaryocytes, it is regulated by the GATA-1 transcription factor. GATA-1 serves as an activating transcription factor of Cyclin D and potentially also as a repressor of the Cyclin D inhibitor, p16. Cdk4 also requires activation upon complex assembly with Cyclin D. This is accomplished by a Cdk activating kinase (CAK), which phosphorylates Cdk4 at threonine 172. Cancer The function of the Cyclin D/Cdk4 complex suggests an obvious link to cancer and tumorigenesis. A hallmark of cancer is the downregulation of such inhibitory proteins as p53 and p27. Following the downregulation of p27, Cdk4 would be uninhibited and constitutively active, resulting in the uncontrolled progression through the G1/S checkpoint, eventually leading to the excessive cell growth and division observed in cancer.

The British government had contemplated establishing an Indian barrier state in the portion of the reserve west of the Appalachian Mountains, and bounded by the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and the Great Lakes. British officials aspired to establish such a state even after the region was assigned to the United States in the Treaty of Paris (1783) ending the American Revolutionary War, but abandoned their efforts in 1814 after losing military control of the region during the War of 1812.Dwight L. Smith, \\"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea.\\" Northwest Ohio Quarterly 61#2-4 (1989): 46-63 traces the idea from 1750s to 1814 In present-day United States, it consisted of all the territory north of Florida and New Orleans that was east of the Mississippi River and west of the Eastern Continental Divide in the Appalachian Mountains that formerly comprised the eastern half of Louisiana (New France). In modern Canada, it consisted of all the land immediately north of the Great Lakes but south of Rupert's Land belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company, as well as a buffer between the Province of Canada and Rupert's Land stretching from Lake Nipissing to Newfoundland. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 organized on paper much of the new territorial gains in three colonies in North America‚ÄîEast Florida, West Florida, and Quebec. The rest of the expanded British territory was left to Native Americans. The delineation of the Eastern Divide, following the Allegheny Ridge of the Appalachians, confirmed the limit to British settlement established at the 1758 Treaty of Easton, before Pontiac's War. Additionally, all European settlers in the territory (who were mostly French) were supposed to leave the territory or get official permission to stay. Many of the settlers moved to New Orleans and the French land on the west side of the Mississippi (particularly St. Louis), which in turn had been ceded secretly to Spain to become Louisiana (New Spain). However, many of the settlers remained and the British did not actively attempt to evict them. In 1768, lands west of the Alleghenies and south of the Ohio were ceded to the colonies by the Cherokee at the Treaty of Hard Labour and by the Six Nations at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix. However, several other aboriginal nations, particularly Shawnee and Mingo, continued to inhabit and claim their lands that had been sold to the British by other tribes. This conflict led to Dunmore's War in 1774, ended by the Treaty of Camp Charlotte where these nations agreed to accept the Ohio River as the new boundary. Restrictions on settlement were to become a flash point in the American Revolutionary War, following the Henderson Purchase of much of Kentucky from the Cherokee in 1775. The renegade Cherokee chief Dragging Canoe did not agree to the sale, nor did the Royal Government in London, which forbade settlement in this region. As an act of revolution in defiance of the crown, white pioneer settlers began pouring into Kentucky in 1776, opposed by Dragging Canoe in the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars, which continued until 1794.

Dissolution In the area of the Indian Reserve in what is now the United States, after coming under firm control of the new country, was gradually settled by European Americans and divided into territories and states, starting with the Northwest Territory. Most (but not all) Indians in the area of the former Reserve were relocated further west under policies of Indian Removal. After the Louisiana Purchase, the Indian Intercourse Act of 1834 created an Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River as a destination, until it too was divided into territories and states for European American settlement, leaving only modern Indian Reservations inside the boundaries of U.S. states.

He won Super Bowl XXVII and Super Bowl XXVIII, both over the Buffalo Bills. He played college football at Albany State University. Early life Gant attended Kathleen High School in Lakeland, Florida. He received a football scholarship from Albany State University, where although he came in as an offensive player, he was converted to the defensive side and became a four-year starter at cornerback. As a freshman, he posted 15 tackles, 3 interceptions and one pass defensed. As a sophomore, he tallied 33 tackles, 3 interceptions and 6 passes defensed.

It is the eldest and only surviving branch of the House of Berg, which was among the most powerful dynasties in the region of the lower Rhine during the Middle Ages. Some historians link them to an even older dynasty, the Ezzonen, going back to the 9th century. The Limburg-Stirum were imperial counts within the Holy Roman Empire, until they were mediatised in 1806 by the Confederation of the Rhine. Although undisputedly a mediatised comital family, having enjoyed a dynastic status for over 600 years until the collapse of the Empire, they were omitted from the Almanach de Gotha because the branches of the family possessing mediatised lands were extinct by the time (1815) that the Congress of Vienna established the German Confederation's obligation to recognise their dynastic status. Since the 9th century, the family counted five Counts Palatine of Lotharingia, several Dukes of Westphalia, Bavaria, Carinthia and Swabia, seven Archbishops of Cologne, one Prince-Bishop of Speyer, more than ten bishops in the Holy Roman Empire, and at least two saints of the Catholic Church (Saint Richenza, celebrated on 21 March, and Saint Engelbert of Cologne, celebrated on 7 November). The territorial authority of the family, counts of Berg since 1077, counts of Altena and Isenberg, then counts of Limburg since 1246, was significantly reduced following the opposition of Frederick II, Count of Isenberg to the aggression of his cousin, the Archbishop of Cologne, Engelbert II of Berg, leading to the murder of the latter. A cadet branch, the Counts van den Marck, later rose in importance as dukes of Cleves, J√ºlich and Berg, dukes of Nevers and Bouillon, counts of Schleiden, etc. Today's members are mostly found in Belgium and The Netherlands. History =The Ezzonian Dynasty= the crowning of Emperor Henry IV (left) by Clement III (center- right). Between them is Count Palatine Hermann II. Chronicle of Otto von Freising, Codex Jenensis Bose q.6 (1157). The Ezzonen appear in the chronicles with Erenfried I (866-904), count of the Bliesgau, Keldachgau and Bonngau (maybe also count of Charmois). Probably he had Carolingian ancestors, although some historians prefer to link him to former Thuringian kings. The Ezzonian dynasty (named after Count Palatine Ezzo) were the Counts Palatine of Lotharingia during the 10th and 11th centuries. They were important in governance of the region of the Middle and Lower Rhine. In spite of their military accomplishments in favour of the German emperors, the Ezzonians did not succeed in building a territorial entity in Lotharingia. During a limited period, they were, however, assigned the duchies of Swabia, Bavaria and Carinthia. Famous members of the dynasty are: Richeza of Lotharingia, Queen of Poland * Ezzo, Count Palatine of Lotharingia (1015‚Äì1034). According to the Brauweiler chronicle, he failed to succeed in the monarchy after the death of emperor Otto III (983‚Äì1002) in a rivalry with duke Heinrich II of Bavaria (1002‚Äì1024). The succession war between Ezzo and Heinrich II continued for over ten years. Both parties came to an agreement after a battle in Odernheim (1011). Kaiserswerth, Duisburg and the surrounding imperial territories were granted as a fief to Ezzo for renouncing the throne (after 1016). When the German crown passed from the Ottonian to the Salian (1024), the Ezzonen remained neutral, apparently after an agreement between Ezzo and Konrad II (1024‚Äì1039). The Annales Hildesheimenses record that \\"Hezo Palatinus comes\\" died after catching pox from his concubine. * Otto I, Count Palatine of Lotharingia (1035‚Äì1045) and Duke of Swabia (1045‚Äì1047). After a successful campaign against the rebelling count of Flanders (margrave of Valenciennes and Ename), Otto received the duchy of Swabia in 1045 in exchange for the cities of Kaiserswerth and Duisburg, which went back to the crown. At the same time, the palatinate of Lotharingia was passed to his nephew. * Heinrich I Furiosus, Count Palatine of Lotharingia from 1045 until 1060. He was elected as successor for the German kingdom during Emperor Heinrich III's illness. Hearing that his wife Mathilde (daughter of Duke Gozelo of Lotharingia, and sister of pope Stephen IX) had a love-affair with one of his relatives, he killed her with an axe. Heinrich then was enclosed into the abbey of Echternach, where he died in 1061. * Richeza of Lotharingia, Queen of Poland. Her marriage to Mieszko II was decided as part of peace an agreement between King Boles≈Çaw I the Brave and Emperor Otto III. After she returned to Germany after the deposition of her husband in 1031, she became later a nun and today is reverencied as Blessed Richeza of Lotharingia, celebrated on 21 March. * Conrad I, Duke of Bavaria, heir of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor. He was deprived of the dukedom in 1053 when the Emperor installed his son as Duke. He died in exile after an attempt to assassinate the Emperor and seize the throne. * Conrad III, was installed as Duke of Carinthia in 1057. The Annales of Berthold record the death in 1061 of Chounradus... Carantanis ducis. * Hermann I, Archbishop of Cologne, Chancellor of King Zwentibold of Lotharingia. * Hermann II, Archbishop of Cologne. He became Archchancellor of Italy and protector of Brauweiler (1053). He baptised and crowned the German king Henry IV. * Hermann II, Count Palatine of Lotharingia (1064‚Äì1085), count of the Ruhrgau, Zulpichgau and Brabant. Hermann is assumed to be last of the Ezzonians. After his death (in a duel with Albert III of Namur, nearby his castle of Dalhem on 20 September 1085) the Palatinate of Lotharingia was suspended. His widow remarried with the first count palatine of the Rhine, Henry of Laach. The surviving line of the Ezzonen descends from Adolf I of Lotharingia, son of Hermann I \\"Pusillus\\", Count palatine of Lotharingia. =Counts of Berg= Statue of Adolf I de Monte, first Count of Berg, at Schloss Burg In 1133, count Adolf II built Schloss Burg on a mountain over the river Wupper. It remained the main residence of the counts of Berg until the 14th century. After the Thirty Years' War, in 1648, Imperial troops destroyed the fortifications of the castle. Count Frederick I of Altena purchased Schloss Mark near Hamm from the Edelherren of R√ºdenberg and made it the residence of the new Counts of the Mark. Adolf I of Lotharingia grandson, Adolf I of Berg, Vogt of Werden Abbey, became the first Count of Berg in 1050. The Counts of Berg became the most powerful dynasty in the Rhine region. Early rulers of Berg were: * Adolf I of Lotharingia, count in Keldachgau, Vogt of Deutz from 1008 until 1018. * Adolf II of Lotharingia, count in Keldachgau and Vogt of Deutz. * Adolf I of Berg, 1st Count of Berg from 1077 till 1082, Vogt of Werden, Deutz, Berg and Gerresheim. * Adolf II of Berg-H√∂vel (Huvili), Count of Berg from 1082 till 1093. He married in 1035 Adelheid von Laufen, heiress of H√∂vel, Unna, Telgte, Warendorf, etc. He founded the Altenberg monastery. * Adolf III, Count of Berg from 1093 till 1132. His son, Eberhard of Berg, 1st Abbot of Georgenthal, convinced his brother Adolf IV to donate the Altenberg monastery to the Cistercian Order. His youngest son, Bruno II, Archbishop of Cologne, died in 1137 in Apulia on campaign with King Lothair of Germany against Roger II of Sicily. * Adolf IV, Count of Berg from 1132 until 1160 and Count of Altena. He built the Schloss Altena, and built the Altenberg monastery, whose cloister he joined in 1160. He is father of one crusader (Adolf V, killed in Damascus in 1108), two Archbishops of Cologne and Duke of Westfalia and one Prince Bishop of Osnabr√ºck. * Engelbert I, Count of Berg from 1160 till 1189. He brought stability and prosperity to the county. In July 1189 he was killed on his way to the Holy Land with the Third Crusade. * Adolf VI, Count of Berg from 1189 till 1218. In 1212 he took part to the Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars. He died in 1218 in combat as commander of the troops in Damiette, in the delta of the Nile, with the Fifth Crusade. He left no son, and Berg passed under the regency of his brother Engelbert II, then to his daughter Irmgard. * Engelbert II of Berg, Archbishop of Cologne, Regent of Berg from 1218 till 1225, better known as Saint Engelbert of Cologne. He was killed by his cousin Frederick of Isenberg (see below). * Irmgard, heiress of Berg until 1248, married to Henry IV Duke of Limburg, and future Count of Berg. =Counts of Altena and Isenberg= Eberhard IV of Berg, son of Adolf IV of Berg and Altena, inherited the eastern territorium of County of Berg. With him, the oldest line of the Counts of Berg takes from 1166 the name and title of Counts of Altena (on the Lenne, Westphalia). Eberhard's territorium was later divided between his two sons: * Arnold of Altena, the elder, inherited the north-western territorium of Altena (on the Ruhr, Hattingen) in 1200. He founded the line of the Counts of Isenberg and later Counts of Limburg (see below). * Frederick I, the younger, inherited the south-eastern territory of Altena, and founded of the line of the Counts von der Marck, from which descend the dukes of Cleves, J√ºlich and Berg, the dukes of Nevers and Bouillon, the counts of Schleiden, etc. =The murder: from Isenberg to Limburg= Frederick II, Count of Isenberg was a leading figure in the opposition of Westphalian nobles to the aggressive power politics of his cousin, the Archbishop of Cologne, Engelbert II of Berg. In 1225 at the Nobles' Assembly in Soest, Frederick met his cousin Engelbert von Berg in order to bring about a peaceful agreement concerning the stewardship (Vogtei) of the Abbey of Essen which Frederick, according to contemporary complaints, was abusing to his own benefit and to the detriment of the abbey. No conclusion was reached. During their return together from Soest to Cologne, Count Frederick arranged an ambush of his cousin, in a sunken lane of the early medieval historic road from Dortmund to Cologne near Gevelsberg late in the afternoon of 7 November 1225: the Archbishop was killed. St Englebert II of Berg, Archbishop of Cologne There is no consensus as to whether it was a deliberately planned murder, or whether the Archbishop was killed in the heat of combat. Current research assumes the latter: Engelbert was intended to have been taken into \\"knightly detention\\" so that the political demands of the opposing nobility could be pushed through. This was in accordance with the customs of the medieval feuding ethos. Frederick of Isenberg was outlawed and excommunicated. He was stripped of all offices and stewardships and his personal wealth was confiscated. In the winter of 1225/1226 the new Archbishop of Cologne, Heinrich von M√ºllenark, besieged and destroyed his castle. His cousin, Adolf von der Mark, was attributed large portions of Frederick's possessions and as such re-united the former territory of Altena. Frederick travelled with his brothers Dietrich and Engelbert, bishops of M√ºnster and Osnabr√ºck (both also implicated in the death of the Archbishop), and the notary of Isenberg with the necessary documents to the Curia in Rome, in order to have the excommunication lifted. On the return journey Frederick was taken prisoner at Li√®ge and sold for 2,100 silver marks to the chapter of Cologne cathedral. On 14 November 1226 he was executed in front of the Severin Gate. His arms and legs were smashed and he was broken on the wheel, after which he was displayed on a stone pillar. He did not die until the next day. His son Count Dietrich I of Isenberg, disinherited of all his territories in the Holy Roman Empire following the execution of his father, later fought with the military support of his uncle the Duke of Limburg, to retrieve his paternal inheritance. On 1 May 1243 a peace agreement was signed between Dietrich and Count Adolf von der Mark. He built the castles of Limburg (Hohenlimburg) and Neu Isenberg (soon lost in favour of the Counts von der Mark) and from 1246 took the title of Count of Limburg. Two of his son's, Johan and Eberhard founded two separate familylines. Johan the eldest died a few years after his marriage. Eberhard inherited after his father's dead, the title of count of Limburg, (later on Limburg Broich) taking up residence at the castle Hohenlimburg an der Lenne.Johann acquired M√ºlheim an der Ruhr and thereby the castle of Styrum, taking up residence there. =16th to 18th century= Count Georg of Limburg-Styrum married in 1539 Irmgarde van Wisch, Lady of Wisch op Oud-Wisch, Wildenborch, Overhagen and Lichtenvoorde, hereditary Countess of Bronckhorst. She inherited the possessions of her uncle, the last count of Bronckhorst and Borculo. Her considerable possessions passed to her son Hermann Georg of Limburg, and the family settled in Gelderland. His grandson, Jobst of Limburg-Styrum, married Maria of Holstein-Pinneberg, heiress of the immediate lordship of Gemen and of Illereichen. Gemen remained for two centuries in the possession of the Counts of Limburg Stirum. Herman Otto IHis son Herman Otto I, Count of Limburg and Bronckhorst, lord of Gemen, served in the armies of the Dutch Republic. He commanded Christian of Brunswick's rearguard at the Battle of Stadtlohn (1623) and the Dutch cavalry at the Siege of Groenlo (1627). In 1644, the three sons of Hermann Otto I divided the family possessions among themselves: Limburg Bronckhorst Otto of Limburg obtained the territories of Bronckhorst and Borculo, founding the older line, still flourishing. In the long conflict (known as the \\"Borculo question\\") between the heirs of the last count of Limburg-Bronckhorst, Joost (deceased in 1553 without children), and the Prince-Bishop of M√ºnster over ownership of Borculo, the Court of Gelderland ruled on 20 December 1615 in favour of Count Joost. The ruling was imposed by troops from Zutphen, taking over the castle and city of Lichtenvoorde in December 1615, and the castle and city of Borculo in February 1616 after short combat. Prince Bishop Christoph Bernhard von Galen, tried twice more to keep Borculo under M√ºnster's authority, but without success. The lordship of Bronckhorst was sold in 1721 by Maria of Limburg Styrum and in 1726 the lordship of Borculo was sold by Count Leopold to the count of Flodorf. Limburg Stirum Gemen Adolf Ernst of Limburg Stirum obtained the immediate lordship of Gemen and Illereichen in the 1644 partition and ruled it until his death in 1657, founding the line of Limburg Stirum Gemen. In 1782, with the extinction of the Gemen branch, Gemen was inherited by the line of Limburg Stirum Iller- AicheheimAugust Philip of Limburg Stirum, was Prince Bishop of Speyer and lord of Gemen. * 1657-1675 - Countess Maria Isabella von Vehlen und Meggen zu Raesfeld, wife of Adolf Ernst, was regent of Gemen after the death of her husband. The reason for the long regency is not known. * 1675-1704 - Hermann Otto II of Limburg Stirum and Bronckhorst, lord of Gemen, son of the above. He fought in the War of the Spanish Succession in the service of the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I against France and Bavaria. In 1703, he lost the Battle of H√∂chst√§dt against the French-Bavarian forces. In 1704, he led the second assault on enemy positions in the Battle of Schellenberg and was mortally wounded, dying a few days later; * 1704-1743 - Otto Leopold of Limburg Stirum and Bronckhorst, lord of Gemen and Raesfeld, inherited Gemen at the death of his father. He also inherited from his grandfather Alexander IV, Count von Velen zu Raesfeld the lordship of Raesfeld; * 1743-1771 - Friedrich Karl of Limburg Stirum and Bronckhorst, lord of Gemen, son of Otto Leopold. He died in 1771 without descendants and both Gemen and Raesfeld passed to his brother, August Philip; * 1771-1776 - August Philip, Prince-Bishop of Speyer, Count of Limburg Stirum and Bronckhorst, lord of Gemen, brother of the above; * 1776-1798 - Karl Josef, Count of Limburg Stirum, lord of Gemen, cousin of the above; * 1798-1800 - Ferdinand IV, Count of Limburg Stirum zu Illereichen, grandson of the above, was the last lord of Gemen before it passed to the barons von Bomelberg in 1800. In 1806, Gemen was mediatized to the princes of Salm-Kyrburg. It passed to France in 1810, then to Prussia in 1814. Limburg Styrum Oberstein passed to the Limburg Styrum in the 18th Century, until its mediatization in 1801 Moritz of Limburg-Styrum obtained the ownership of M√ºlheim an der Ruhr and thereby of the immediate lordship of Styrum, and later Oberstein. Here he founded the line of counts of Limburg- Styrum-Styrum, extinct in 1809. Moritz later also became hereditary banneret of the Principality of Guelders and of the County of Zutphen. He married his cousin Maria Bernhardine of Limburg-Bronckhorst. In the mediatisation of 1806, Styrum came under control of the Grand Duchy of Berg. The last count of Limburg-Styrum-Styrum, Ernst (deceased on 23 March 1809) left Styrum to the sister of his wife, Maria Margaretha von Humbracht, who sold it in 1825. Oberstein was mediatized at the Treaty of Lun√©ville in 1801, however Ernst was never compensated by the Final Recess of the Empire in 1803. Mediatisation The Limburg Stirum held seats in the Holy Roman Empire's Imperial Diet until 1800, through their possessions of immediate lordships in Gemen, Oberstein, Styrum, etc. When the branch of Gemen became extinct in 1800, the branch of Styrum failed to inherit their possessions, and Gemen passed to the barons von Boyneburg-B√∂melberg. In 1806 the Confederation of the Rhine occurred and Gemen was mediatised to the Principality of Salm-Kyrburg. At the same moment Styrum was mediatised to the Grand Duchy of Berg. This branch became extinct three years later, in 1809. Since the Limburg Stirum held no imperial estate when the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806 (Gemen had been lost in 1800 and it is unclear if the Styrum branch did inherit the dynastic rights associated with Gemen), nor were any Limburg Stirum living in the German Confederation when the Congress of Vienna finalised the distinctions between the sovereign and non-sovereign dynasties of the former Empire (at that time all members were living in the newly created Kingdom of the Netherlands), the House of Limburg Stirum's centuries of previous status as immediate Reichsgrafen was not internationally recognised, nor was their head granted the style of Erlaucht (Illustrious Highness) and they were omitted from Section II of the Almanach de Gotha, which listed therein the other princely and countly families of mediatised dynastic rank. The house of Limburg Stirum is nevertheless considered part of the Standesherren by most authors on the subject.Heinz Gollwitzer, Die Standesherren.

Painting by Jan Willem Pieneman (1779-1853). The titles of the House of Limburg Stirum were confirmed in 1812 by Napoleon I and in 1814 the family was recognised in the nobility of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (name: van Limburg Stirum). Notable figures in recent history are: * Leopold, Count of Limburg Stirum (1758‚Äì1840), Lieutenant General of Dutch Infantry, and member of the Driemanschap, the triumvirate that took power in 1813 in the name of the Prince of Orange-Nassau in order to establish the monarchy in the Netherlands. The three statesmen invited the exiled Prince of Orange, later King William I of the Netherlands, to The Hague to avoid anarchy following the retreat of France's troops, and to avoid possible absorption of the Netherlands by Prussia or England. * Menno David, Count of Limburg Stirum (1807‚Äì1891) was a Dutch general and government minister. He lost his right leg during the Siege of Antwerp (1832). After serving as Dutch minister of war he became aide-de-camp and advisor to King William III of the Netherlands. * Friedrich zu Limburg-Stirum was a German diplomat and politician who served as foreign minister of Germany in 1880‚Äì1881. * Johan Paul van Limburg Stirum (1873‚Äì1948), Dutch diplomat and reformist Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. He worked for the economic development, decentralisation and the autonomy of the colony. He would later become ambassador to Berlin where he was known for his critical views on National Socialism, even refusing Nazi officials entry to the Dutch embassy. After leaving Berlin he would serve as Dutch envoy to London. * Otto Ernst Gelder van Limburg Stirum was a Dutch magistrate and maternal uncle to Audrey Hepburn. As a prominent Dutchman he was taken hostage by the German occupiers and was one of five Dutchmen to be executed in retaliation for resistance activities on 17 April 1942. These five were the first Dutch hostages to suffer this fate. * Charles de Limburg Stirum (15 September 1906 - 14 June 1989), a Belgian senator, member of the armed resistance during World War II, was later Grand Master of the Royal Households of King Leopold III of Belgium. He became a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece (Austrian branch). * Franz von Limburg Stirum, a claimant to the headship of the House, lives in Finland. Others * The Limburg-Styrum Dragoons Regiment fought with six squadrons (500 men) during the battles of Schellenberg and Blenheim in 1704 during the War of the Spanish Succession; and in the Battle of Melle in 1745 during the War of the Austrian Succession. The Styrum Dragoons uniform was a red coat with green facings, white buttons and straw-yellow breeches. It was disbanded in 1748.The Austrian Army 1740-80 (1): Cavalry, by Philip Haythornthwaite * The Counts of Limburg Stirum created two orders of knighthood: the Order of the Four Emperors and the Order of St Philip of the Lion of Limburg. In 1806 the Counts of Limburg Stirum were mediatized and lost their rights on their territories. However the Order Order of St Philip of the Lion of Limburg was still in use until 1838. * Limburg Stirum is also the name of a mountain, 2350 meters high, standing in the Belgica Mountains in Antarctic. It was discovered by the Belgian expedition (1957‚Äì58) under G. de Gerlache, who named it for Count Charles de Limburg Stirum, a patron of the expedition. * The Jerusalem Church in Bruges (Belgium) was founded in 1428 by the Adornes family. Anselm Adornes completed this remarkable building after his return from pilgrimage to Jerusalem. It was intended to be a copy of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The Jerusalem Church is still today private property and belongs to the Limburg Stirum as direct descendants of the Adornes. * In Belgium, Count Evrard de Limburg Stirum (1927‚Äì2001), the oldest son of Thierry, Count of Limburg Stirum and Princess Marie-Immacul√©e de Cro√ø, married Princess H√©l√®ne d'Orl√©ans (1934-), a daughter of Henri d'Orl√©ans, Comte de Paris, the Orl√©anist claimant to the throne of France. After several years in Rhodesia, they settled in the Castle of Huldenberg in Belgium. * Count Alexis de Limburg Stirum married, in the Castle of Uss√© (France), B√©atrix de Blacas d'Aulps, daughter of the 7th Duke and Prince of Blacas d'Aulps. They live in the castle of Walzin (Belgium). * Count Rodolphe de Limburg Stirum, son of Count Christian de Limburg Stirum and grandson of Count Thierry, married on 6 December 2008 in Mechelen, Archduchess Marie-Christine of Austria, a niece of Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg. She is the great-granddaughter of King Leopold III of Belgium through her mother Archduchess Marie Astrid of Austria, and of Emperor Charles I of Austria through her father Archduke Carl Christian of Austria. They have three sons (Leopold, Constantin and Gabriel).

She spoke the Muskogee Creek language fluently. The main information source was from an interview in the summer of 1937, at which time she was guessed to be 89 years old. Lucinda's parents were owned by two different Creek Indians. Being enslaved so young without her parents, she never found out her birthplace, nor the time of her birth. Her parents were both African slaves who sold her close to her birth, because they left their own masters either by running away or buying back their freedom. When Lucinda's parents left, her mother's master sold her to Tuskaya-hiniha. Lucinda was brought up in the Creek family she was sold to. Tuskaya-hiniha Tuskaya-hiniha means \\"head man warrior\\"; he farmed and sold corn from his good-sized farm. The farm was about north of the Elk River and south of Fort Gibson in what is now Oklahoma. Shortly before the American Civil War, Lucinda's master became blind, which led many of his slaves to run away. Lucinda remained with her master throughout the war and even after she was freed, because she was young and had no prospects. Tuskaya-hiniha initially bought Lucinda so she could look after the baby in the family. The baby wasn't old enough to have a name, so for the time being they all called him \\"Istilusti\\", which means \\"little man\\". The naming of boys was important in the Creeks' culture. Creek Indian traditions and culture Tuskaya-hiniha's house was log with a dirt floor and a bush roof. All the food was eaten and cooked in the yard in big pots. One of the dishes made was sofki. First, corn would be pounded very fine, then it would be poured into water, then the skin would be drained off. After that, the grits would be soaked and boiled and left to stand, at which point it is ready to serve. Sometimes they would put pounded hickory meats into the sofki. This particular meal was made in large portions, and anyone who was hungry was allowed some. If there were guests, they were allowed as much as they wanted; in fact, it was expected for them to do so. If they didn't, Tuskaya-hiniha would be mad. Dances The dances were different types of banga. For instance, there is the chicken dance which is called Tolosabanga. The Istifanibanga is where every one dresses up, then they pretend they're skeletons and \\"raw heads\\" who are coming to get you. The next dance could have been one of the ritual dances, but it sounds more as though Lucinda was young and didn't know reckless partying. This dance is known as the \\"drunk dance\\", none of the good people dance to this one. Those who do dance, fumble around \\"wrasslin' and huggin'\\" and they sing about going over to sleep at someone else's house, then shout \\"We aren't wrong because we are drunk and don't know what we are doing\\" and such. The really bad ones go off into the woods. This action angered the good people, to the point where some to the people had killings over it. One time the husband or father of a woman, who went to the woods with a man, got beaten and the rims of her ears sliced off. It was said to be a rumor, but Lucinda was brushing a girl's hair one time and saw her ears were mostly gone. Slavery The way the Creeks treated slaves was considered a much different and kinder form of slavery than the way the white Americans, Cherokee, or Choctaw went about it. Families could work under different slave owners and did not have to live on the same property as who they worked for. The slaves worked quite hard and were paid, but had to give most of their pay to their owners, being allowed to keep a small amount. Lucinda was treated as a family member and did her duties. Her responsibility was taking care of the baby, amongst being an extra hand for cleaning and cooking here and there. She was not beaten or disrespected. It was understood what was needed of her and she followed along. More of her life She was an eyewitness to the Battle of Honey Springs that occurred near her home in the summer of 1864. Honey Springs was down \\"the road\\" (the main, big dirt road her master took to trade corn and get clothing) to the closest trade town. By this time Tuskaya-hiniha was blind and most of his slaves had run off. One morning, before the sun rose, Lucinda was with the baby boy pushing him on the swing, and a man on a horse ran over the hill calling the battle cry to warn all of what was coming. Tuskaya-hiniha heard it, and the family (including Lucinda and the remaining slaves) quickly readied the important necessities‚Äîmeats, pots, corn and blankets‚Äîwhich they loaded into a wagon and went on their way. The rainy weather was not helpful as it resulted in mud and the family had to pull off and wait it out. While they waited, Confederate soldiers passed their way with big guns. The Yankees burned down most of Honey Springs. The night passed with the lullaby of gun fire, then they headed back home the next day. Upon arrival, they found their chickens and hogs were undisturbed and everything else to be fine; apparently the soldiers had no time to take a thing. The war wasn't over yet, and the family packed up and moved on to be out of danger. The road was filled with wagons, and the rain began once again. The wagons traveled in packs, and when one pack ran into the other because of the muddy, rutted road, the people would put all the horses and mules together and pull the wagon out. Not only was the road muddy, but it was rutted in a bad way from the trampling of many marching soldiers. During the nights, there would be group meals; all the women and slaves gathered and cooked the food in large pots. The men were so worn-out and hungry that by the time they were through eating, there wasn't any food left for the women and slaves. The family traveled north, and Canada became the destination. They arrived, but there were no free houses or hospitalities that weren't already taken up by the soldiers; there weren't enough for the soldiers. Some soldiers camped out, and the Indians camped near them. Lucinda did not learn any English until after the war, all she knew was the Creek language. The soldiers were singing and Lucinda did not know what about, so she asked one of the elders. He replied, \\"I wish I was in Dixie, look away, away.\\" Lucinda then asked \\"Where's Dixie?\\" The old Indian laughed and talked to the soldiers who also laughed, and Lucinda was told no more. The following day of their travels brought them to a big river raised from all the previous rain. Lucinda had never seen so much water. The men got some boats to put materials in, then floated the wagons across with the mules and horses swimming alongside, Lucinda thought they would drowned because she had never experienced such a crossing. The place they came to had many vacant homes probably because many people left on account of the war. The Indian soldiers would quit the army and run away in groups; raiding houses as they went, taking everything they saw and killing any in their way. The families who Lucinda was with would always send scouters to look at the home to see if it were vacant and livable, but mainly because it was liable that there was already a scout of someone else's in there. Some houses had fresh graves. They didn't stay there. One house, Tuskaya-hiniha's wife peeked in, and saw that the previous owners were still in it, lying dead all over the floor. They decided to move on to another house, promptly. Finally, a decent house came to be, a little cabin. Lucinda was now the only slave left of Tuskaya-hiniha's. The family lived there for over two years and harvested two crops of corn. They had a neighbor known as 'Mr. Walker' who'd kill wild boar in the forest and catch fish with his bare hands after giving them black root. So the family had as much meat as they could handle The war died out, Lucinda was unsure of when‚Äîespecially since she was living so peacefully again. Lucinda was freed, but stayed with her master until a day came when three men on horseback came and spoke with Tuskaya-hiniha. After some discussion, Tuskaya-hiniha informed Lucinda she was going with the men and finding her family. Before the group crossed the river, the men tied her to her horse so she would not fall off. She again thought she would not reach the other side alive. Thanks to the Creek agency, she was reunited with her ma and pa. She stayed with her parents until she was an adult and her parents had died. Lucinda married Andrew Davis at the Gibson station. They had many children, though only two were still living in 1937. Her son got in trouble with the law and was imprisoned at the McAlester prison. He was released because he was a 'trusty' (meaning he acted well and was trusted by the guards) and the prison allowed him to leave and marry a woman who had lots of property. Age was sneaking in and Lucinda became blind. It was confusing how the other women played in, but after Lucinda's husband died, she moved in with a woman named Josephine where she wouldn't be required to do much. Josephine's children quickly became a loud nuisance to Lucinda and her sensitive ears. She didn't like their manners because they were different from what she had grown up with in the Creek tradition. If the children had been with the Indians, the elders would have whacked the child on the head if they did wrong \\"because the elders knew best\\",--in living memory of Lucinda, those were her words. One source hints that her death took place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, under the care of her daughter.

She was built in Bombay, India in 1817. The 190th anniversary of the ship's official launch was on Friday 12 October 2007. Before April 2005 it was known as Hartlepool Historic Quay. It was built by Teesside Development Corporation as part of the economic regeneration of old industrial sites of Teesside, on the derelict docks that was formally used for industries such as ship building and the timber yards etc. It opened to the public in July 1994. The attraction consists of gift shop and reception, Marine Barracks and Guard Room, a number of period shops and houses, Fighting Ships, Pressganged, Sir William Gray Suite and Baltic Rooms, Skittle Square and children's playship, Bistro and Quayside Coffee Shop, Children's Maritime Adventure Centre, HMS Trincomalee, and the Museum of Hartlepool. The PS Wingfield Castle, preserved at the Museum of Hartlepool is a floating exhibit and cafe. There are hundreds of other exhibits in the museum charting the history of the town from prehistoric times right up to the present day. One of the most popular features is the description of the Hartlepool monkey legend. Others include a full size coble boat, a lighthouse, a shell from the Bombardment of Hartlepool and many ships' models and engine displays. The site has seen some improvements in 2006/2007 including a renewed Fighting Ships which is an audio/visual tour of a warship. There is now a new character which is Jim Henshaw, a young powder monkey. New for 2008 include an HMS Trincomalee Exhibition, Viewing Balcony overlooking HMS Trincomalee, upgrading and re- design of the Maritime Adventure Centre and the restoration of PS Wingfield Castle. Nearby is Hartlepool Marina and Navigation Point where there are many restaurants and bars. Hartlepool was the host port for the final leg of The Tall Ships' Races in 2010. In June 2016 operation of the site was taken over from the local council by the National Museum of the Royal Navy, and it was rebranded as NMRN Hartlepool.

A pearmain, also formerly spelt \\"permain\\", is a type of apple. The name may once have been applied to a particular variety of apple that kept well, although in more modern times its inclusion in varietal names was, like the term 'Pippin', \\"largely decoration\\"Smith, A. W. (1963) A Gardener's Handbook of Plant Names: Their Meanings and Origins, p.40 rather than indicating any shared qualities. The original 'Pearmain' variety has not been conclusively identified and may now be extinct. Etymology and history There has been some debate over the origin of the name \\"pearmain\\". The pomologist Robert Hogg suggested that it originated in mediaeval times from pyrus magnus, \\"great pear\\", and referred to a type of apple having a large pear-like shape.Hogg, R. (1851) British Pomology, London: Groombridge, p.209 Hogg believed that the variety 'Winter Pearmain' was both \\"the original of all the Pearmains\\" and the oldest recorded variety of apple in England, with evidence it was cultivated in Norfolk in c.1200. Other sources suggest that the name \\"pearmain\\" was in fact originally used for a type of pear, and was first applied to apples only during the 16th century.Ayto (2012) The Diner's Dictionary: Word Origins of Food and Drink, OUP, p.400 It has been suggested the word was derived from Old French pearmain and possibly ultimately from Latin parmensia \\"of Parma\\", though the latter is probably folk etymology. The third and most likely derivation, by the philologist Ernest Weekley, also suggests the term was originally applied to pears, but that it came from Middle English parmain, permain, derived from Old French parmaindre \\"to endure\\", and referred to the long keeping qualities of some varieties.Weekley (1921) An etymological dictionary of modern English, v2, p.1057 Rejecting the etymology from parmensia, Weekley noted that 17th century references to a \\"pompire\\" or \\"pyramalum\\" (i.e. an \\"apple-pear\\") suggested that the original 'Pearmain' apple was named for some quality associated with the pearmain pear; i.e. hardness and long keeping ability.Weekley (1926) Words Ancient and Modern, J. Murray, p.82 'Pearmain' cultivars Pearmain apple cultivars include: * Adams Pearmain * Baxters Pearmain * Blue Pearmain * John Pearmain * Christmas Pearmain * Claygate Pearmain * Foulden Pearmain * Grange's Pearmain * Hormead Pearmain * Hubbard's Pearmain * King Charles Pearmain * Lamb Abbey Pearmain * Laxton's Pearmain * London Pearmain * Mannington's Pearmain * Old Pearmain * Winter Pearmain * Worcester Pearmain Present status of 'Old Pearmain' variety There have been many efforts to identify the original 'Pearmain' apple, of supposedly mediaeval origin. Hogg suggested the 'Winter Pearmain' to be the original, and synonymous with the 'Old Pearmain', though S. A. Beach, in his work Apples of New York, noted that \\"several different varieties\\" had been propagated in America and England under the name 'Winter Pearmain' and that in many descriptions \\"it is impossible to determine which Winter Pearmain the writer had in mind\\".Beach, S. A. (1905) The Apples of New York, v2, p.379 By contrast, Hogg believed the apple identified in some catalogues of the time as 'Old Pearmain' to in fact be a variety called 'Royal Pearmain'.Hogg (1851), p.175 Hogg later claimed to have identified the \\"true Old Pearmain\\" growing in the Dymock area.Hogg (1884) The Fruit Manual, p.169 The current 'Old Pearmain' in the National Fruit Collection was received in 1924 from a Mr. Kelsey in Surrey, but is probably neither Hogg's variety nor the ancient 'Pearmain'.Morgan and Richards (2002) The New Book of Apples, Ebury, p.248 References Category:Apple cultivars ","title":"Pearmain"},{"id":"9896083","title":"1982 Alpine Skiing World Cup ‚Äì Women's Slalom"},{"id":"9896090","text":"The large-billed reed warbler (Acrocephalus orinus) is an Old World warbler in the genus Acrocephalus.

The upper mandible is dark, but the cutting edges and entire lower mandible are pale. The tarsi, toes and claws appear pale brown. The hind claw is longer than in A. dumetorum. The tips of the tail feathers are pointed and more acutely lanceolate than in A. dumetorum or Acrocephalus concinens. The primary tips are broad and rather squarer. Recent observers note that it has a habit of fanning out its tail open as it forages. The specimens from Afghanistan and Kazakhstan suggest that they breed in Central Asia and moult indicates that they migrate along the Himalayas to winter in northern India and Southeast Asia. Sequence variation points to a stable or shrinking population structure. History It was first collected by Allan Octavian Hume in the Sutlej Valley near Rampur, Himachal Pradesh, India on 13 November 1867. This specimen (BMNH registration no. 1886.7.8. 1742) was first provisionally described as Phyllopneuste macrorhyncha (Hume, 1869Hume, A. 1869. Ibis 2 (5): 355‚Äì357 (no title).) but the name was changed two years later to Acrocephalus macrorhynchus (Hume, 1871). H C Oberholser however pointed out in 1905 that this was unacceptable because a specimen from Egypt described by von M√ºller in 1853 as Calamoherpe macrorhyncha turned out to be Acrocephalus stentoreus; Acrocephalus macrorhynchus was abandoned in favour of A. orinus. The identity of the species was in question and until 2002 was considered as a synonym of the clamorous reed warbler (Acrocephalus stentoreus).Grimmett, R., Inskipp, C. & Inskipp, T. 1998.

Rediscovery On 27 March 2006 a living specimen was caught at the Laem Phak Bia Environmental Research and Development Project in Phetchaburi, Thailand by ornithologist Philip Round of Mahidol University. The bird was ringed and two feathers were extracted; DNA from them was found to match the DNA of the 1867 specimen.The Nation, Bird comes back from the dead , 7 March 2007 Based on the short and rounded wings, earlier studies had suggested that the species was likely to be a short-distant migrant or a resident. The rediscoveries of a second museum specimen from a different location and the wild specimen from Thailand suggest that this may not be so.

He came across a small brown warbler and recorded its song. Dr. Timmins did not realize the importance of his discovery until he visited a Natural History Museum in Tring, England. There he examined a specimen of a large-billed reed warbler, which looked identical to the bird he had seen and recorded. A team of ornithologists, including Afghan scientists of the Wildlife Conservation Society, confirmed his discovery by capturing, sampling and releasing almost 20 specimens of the bird in 2009, the largest number ever recorded, using a combination of field observations, museum specimens, DNA sequencing, and also the first known audio recording of the species that were already made in 2008.\\"'World's least known bird' found breeding in Afghanistan\\" A study by Russian ornithologists in 2011 indicated that the species had been misidentified as A. dumetorum in museum collections and that the species may be breeding in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, eastern Uzbekistan and south-eastern Kazakhstan.
