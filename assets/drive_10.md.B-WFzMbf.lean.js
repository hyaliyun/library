Built in 1870 and extensively remodeled in 1874, it is a fine example of transitional Italianate-Second Empire architecture, and was owned for many years by Bridgton's most prominent businessman, mill owner William F. Perry. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history The Perry House stands on a hill overlooking the village of Bridgton, on the north side of Main Street (United States Route 302), at its junction with Highland Road. It is basically a high-style interpretation of the 19th-century connected New England farmstead, with its main block connected to a carriage barn via a series of ells. The main house has elaborate style, with projecting window bays flanking its front entrance, with an engaged porch with mini-gabled roof between. The mansard roof is topped by a cupola, and there are hip roof dormers flush with the front facade. Cornices over the window bays and on the roof are bracketed. The elegant Victorian detailing is continued through the ell and to the carriage barn. The house was built in 1870 for William Cross, a local cattle merchant, and was purchased in 1874 by William F. Perry. The house's styling is probably the result of alterations made by Perry, who was by then already owner of Bridgton's largest textile mills. Perry's fortune was due in part to his marriage in 1859 to Anna Maria Gibbs, daughter of the town's biggest mill owner of that period. Perry rapidly expanded the area's mill capacity, and was able to win lucrative contracts to supply textiles to the Union Army during the American Civil War. Perry also invented a more efficient turbine, which was manufactured in Bridgton and installed in mills across Maine. The house is now the Clipper Merchant Tea House that opened in July, 2016.

Crossland III was a lieutenant colonel in the Confederate Army of Tennessee, serving under the commands of Major General Lafayette McLaws and Major General Walthall. He was killed during Braxton Bragg's defense of Lookout Mountain during the Chattanooga Campaign. Crossland, who was Bragg's cousin, reportedly called the defense a \\"selfish and overconfident move by a General who cared little for the welfare of the men under his command.\\" Early life and education Crossland was born in 1829 in Kentucky to James T. Crossland Jr. and Mary Davis Crossland. His father was a lawyer in Louisville and was the brother of Margaret Crossland Bragg, the mother of Major General Braxton Bragg. In 1835, his family moved to Warrenton, North Carolina in order to be closer to their family. He attended Warrenton Male Academy where he excelled in English and was an excellent writer. He was later accepted to Yale University and began studying literature in 1847. After two years at Yale, Crossland accepted an appointment to the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia. He was later commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 5th U.S. Artillery in 1851. Civil War In 1860, Crossland was serving as a first lieutenant in the Virginia militia. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Crossland resigned his commission and was promoted to the rank of captain in the Army of Northern Virginia under the command of Major General Lafayette McLaws. Captain Crossland served as a company commander in the 10th Georgia Infantry Regiment. At the Battle of Fredericksburg, he successfully led his company in the defense of Marye's Heights. Due to his gallantry while defending Marye's Heights, Crossland was promoted to major. Gettysburg Major Crossland led his company at the Battles of Wheatfield and Peach Orchard during the Gettysburg Campaign. His company suffered tremendous losses during its failed attempt to dislodge the Union position at Cemetery Ridge. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and was transferred to the 24th Mississippi. He served as the executive officer of the 24th Mississippi under the command of Colonel William F. Dowd, which was a part of Major General Walthall's Brigade. This was the first time during the war that Crossland was placed under the command of his cousin, Braxton Bragg. Battle of Chattanooga and death During the Battle of Chattanooga, General Bragg ordered Walthall's Brigade, which included the 24th Mississippi to the Bench of Lookout Mountain. The 24th Mississippi was placed in the center with 27th and the 29th Mississippi to the left and right flank respectively. The generals under Bragg's command felt that the defensive position on the bench of Lookout Mountain was a poorly chosen area to mount an effective defense due to the multiple directions from which an enemy could attack. As the battle commenced, General Hooker's Union army outmaneuvered the Confederate lines. Crossland was shot and killed by a Union sharpshooter while attempting to rally his troops. Legacy There are very few remaining memoirs or writings from Crossland. After his death, his writings were transferred to the Bragg estate where they were never seen again. The only history of Crossland's exploits are reports and memoirs from Confederate Generals on his performance and a letter from General Bragg that mentions his cousin. It is thought that Crossland was critical of his cousin, General Braxton Bragg, and wrote about his misgivings within his lost memoirs. Some historians believe that Bragg himself destroyed Crossland's memoir in order to protect the General's legacy.Confederate States of America General Orders 1863 Microfilm 4106 Reel 12:719-5Letter of General Braxton Bragg 1875 MISC:B References Category:1829 births Category:1863 deaths Category:People from Kentucky Category:Virginia Military Institute alumni Category:Confederate States military personnel killed in the American Civil War Category:Confederate States Army officers ","title":"James T.

It is located at the lowest bridging point of the River Medway about from London. The town's location is due to the bridge which carries the Roman Watling Street (now the A2) over the river. Name The source of the Romano-British name for Rochester, Durobrivae, has been a matter of some debate. The name Durobrivae can be translated as \\"stronghold\\" or \\"fort\\" by the \\"bridge\\" or \\"bridges\\".Glover This could have been the oppidum (see pre-Roman history, below) or a pre-Roman fort. No such fort has been discovered by archaeologists, but much of the land has been disturbed by the succeeding two millennia of continuous occupation. Alternatively, Durobrivae may refer to a small fort set up by Aulus Plautius, the general in charge of the first phase of the Roman conquest of Britain; it was not needed for long, as Kent was soon settled. More fundamentally, there was no bridge in AD 43.Marsh The Romans did eventually bridge the river: see the article Rochester Bridge. The Roman pioneers may even have initially built a pontoon bridge to supply the advancing army, replacing it with this permanent structure later. The alternative explanation notes that Durobrivae was also recorded as Durobrovum and Durobrivis. Either of these could be a Latinisation of the British word Dourbruf meaning \\"swift stream\\".Kellys The name is recorded as Durobrivis in around 730 and Dorobrevis in 844. The first of these was pronounced as \\"Robrivis\\". Bede copied down the name, c730, mistaking its meaning as \\"Hrofi's fortified camp\\" (OE Hrofes c√¶ster). From this comes c730 Hrof√¶sc√¶stre, 811 Hrofescester, 1086 Rovescester', 1610 Rochester. From Bede's time the name contained the Latin word castra, which is present in the names of many cities that were once Roman camps (e.g. Chester Latin Deva). It is often assumed that Rochester was a fortified Roman town, but no evidence has been found of a formal fort. The Roman street pattern suggests that it was a line of shops and houses built alongside a road, the characteristic pattern of a vicus. Systematic fortification did take place after AD 175 and this of course was well before Bede's time. The Latinised adjective Roffensis refers to Rochester. Ancient Kit's Coty with the Medway valley in the background Settlement in the area is first evidenced by the Neolithic Medway megaliths, particularly Kit's Coty House. Within the area of Rochester itself Belgic remains under the Roman levels were found in 1961 by R. E. Chaplin. Coin moulds suggest that this was a centre of some importance.Detsicas 1983 cited by Howell 2014 p 40 Celtic Rochester was one of the two oppida of the Cantiaci tribe, the western administrative centre of the Celtic kingdom (the other being their capital of Durovernum Cantiacorum, modern day Canterbury). The Celtic trackway which became Watling Street probably passed through on roughly the current alignment: the geography of the Medway dictates the best crossing point. Roman Permanent Roman occupation began with the Claudian invasion in AD 43. The precise route of the Roman advance has been debated; the army could have come along what is now the Pilgrim's Way to Aylesford or along Watling Street to Rochester. The Medway crossing was opposed, resulting in the Battle of the Medway which was notable for taking two days, unusual for that period. Rochester Bridge, the lowest bridging point of the Medway. The Kentish oppidum was transformed into the Roman settlement of Durobrivae. Its layout establishes the present High Street and Northgate and Boley Hill. The Romans bridged the river at the same point as the present bridge, for Victorian engineers building the bridge discovered the Roman footings.The Roman Bridge There were nine piers of composite stone, timber and rubble construction. On top of the piers longtitudinal timber beams provided the actual bridging structure, with cross planking to form the road surface. They constructed a substantial causeway, wide, over the marshy ground on the Strood Side of the river, extending from the river to the present day Angel Corner. In more settled times, the combination of transport links and the fertile Medway valley became the basis of a developed agricultural economy. Compared to the rest of the country there was a marked abundance of Roman villas lining the valley from Rochester down to Maidstone.Myres p123 During the 190s systematic earthen fortifications were established which were replaced in stone during the 220s. Some of these stone defences are still extant. In AD 407, the last Roman legions left Britain. Following severe Saxon raids in 408 and 409, Honorius sent a letter in 410 to the cities of Britain urging them to look to their own defences. Later in 410, Rome itself fell. Although these dates mark significant changes, a protracted period of sub- Roman culture continued. Medieval Saxon Following the withdrawal of the legions, the defences of the British kingdoms suffered. Eventually, in AD 449, the Jutish brothers Hengist and Horsa landed at Ebbsfleet or possibly Milton Creek, possibly both. The Britons were defeated at Aylesford, leading to the establishment of a Kingdom of Kent uniting Jutes and Saxons. The town of Rochester became the centre of the Cesterwara Lathe.Myres p125 By the early 7th century Rochester boasted a market and a port reeve.Lyon p127 First page of the Textus Roffensis, Rochester Cathedral Library, MS A.3.5 In AD 560, King Ethelbert of Kent came to the throne of Kent. Around AD 600 he promulgated a code of about 90 laws defining crimes and punishments. The code was regarded as sufficiently significant that in the twelfth century (over 500 years later) they were written down in the Textus Roffensis, the \\"Book of [the church of] Rochester\\". Although the only surviving copy is the Textus, the laws are referred to by both Bede and Alfred the Great. √Üthelberht's laws are thought to be both the earliest law code of any kind in any Germanic language and their wording the earliest surviving document in the English language. In AD 597, Augustine of Canterbury established the See of Canterbury, and in AD 604 sent Justus to found a cathedral and become the first bishop in Rochester, indicating the interest in the area on the part of the Roman mission organized from Canterbury. The foundations of a small early Kentish church, under the later Norman cathedral, are identified as belonging to Justus's cathedral, dedicated to St. Andrew;Brooks pp. 24-27. the original cathedral was high and wide. The apse is marked in the present cathedral. Under the Roman system, a bishop was required to have at his see a school for educating suitable persons for the ministry.Whitelock p189 In addition, to provide music a choir school was established which has become The King's School.Loyn p269. Loyn misprints Canterbury for Rochester: Canterbury goes back to the previous decade. The cathedral was served by secular canons, \\"a body of clergy who lived together but were unbound by any monastic rule\\".Stenton p146 This contrasts sharply with the monasticism of the Celtic church one of the factors to figure in the struggle for control of the Church in England. It is notable that Bishop Felix of Burgundy provided to Sigeberht of East Anglia \\"master and teachers according to the customs of Kent\\". England had become religiously unified following the synod of Whitby in AD 664; politically, though, it was still divided into a number of often warring kingdoms. Following the death of Penda of Mercia a period of turmoil had followed during which Surrey had been annexed by the Mercians. The first recorded act of √Üthelred of Mercia in AD 676 was to ravage Kent, destroying Rochester. Three reasons have been suggested for this attack: to prevent King Hlothhere of Kent from regaining control of Surrey, to seek revenge for the murder of the sons of Eormenred of Kent, or at the instigation of the kings of Essex who solicited the invasion in response to recent Kentish attempts to gain dominance over the East Saxons. The damage to the see of Rochester was so great that the incumbent bishop, Putta, retired from his diocese; his appointed successor, Cwichelm, also gave up the see \\"because of its poverty\\".Bede p.226 (Book IV, chapter 12) The thrymsa coinage had become debased so in the 690s it was replaced by silver coins known as sceattas (probably called \\"pennies\\") struck in at least six mints including the one at Rochester.Laing & Laing p.123 The coins continued in use until the 750s. Bede, in the Ecclesiastical History of the English People (AD 730), records the name of the city as Hrof√¶sc√¶stre (see the discussion above under Taxonomy). Sigered, a client king to Offa of Mercia, styled himself Rex Cantiae and granted land in Rochester to the bishop.Stenton p206 Three years later, in 765, his successor Egbert gave more land and the charter was confirmed by Offa as overlord.Stenton p207 In AD 842 Rochester was sacked by invading Danes and was under siege again from them in AD 884. This time the town held out until relieved by King Alfred.Stenton p257 In the 10th century Rochester had the right to mint coins (AD 930). The wooden bridge is mentioned in AD 960, though this may have been a rebuilding in timber using the Roman piers.Rochester, The past 2000 yearsStenton p536Harrison & Evemy p10 Slightly later, during Edward the Confessor's reign, various local estates were documented as having a duty to repair Rochester bridge. For instance: \\"The second pier belongs to Gillingham and to Chatham, and they have to provide planks for one pole and put three beams in position\\".Whitelock p77 Norman The events of 1066 initiated a period of change for Rochester. In 1067, William's half brother Odo was created Earl of Kent. During the period 1067‚Äì1076 Odo acquired land all over England including much of the land of the lands that once belonged to Rochester Cathedral. At the Trial of Penenden Heath in that year the land was recovered. In 1077 Gundulf was consecrated Bishop of Rochester. One of the first acts Gundulf performed as Bishop was to found a hospital for the poor and leprous. Of the original buildings only the chapel survives, the new St. Bartholomew's Hospital is of 19th century construction. The cathedral was by now four and a half centuries old and had become derelict. Always under the ecclesiastical and financial shadow of Canterbury, by the end of Siward's episcopate (1058‚Äì1075) it was served by four or five canons \\"living in squalor and poverty\\".Barlow p221 That it had remained secular is not in doubt; one of the canons, √Üthelric, became priest of Chatham and made a gift to the cathedral for the soul and burial of Godgifu, his wife.Barlow p222 237px With the income from the restored lands Gundulf started to rebuild the cathedral in 1080 a little to the east of its previous site. The church had a threefold purpose: it became the heart of the new Benedictine priory of St Andrew's, it was the seat (cathedra) of the Bishop of Rochester and it housed the parochial altar of St Nicholas' which served the city. This first phase of the cathedral was complete by 1130. Within a year or so either side of 1125 the Textus Roffensis was composed. It contains the foundation charters of the cathedral and diocese, two copies of pre-Conquest Kent parishes and the Laws of Ethelbert (referred to above). The textus also contains a catalogue of the books in the cathedral library at that time. One hundred and sixteen volumes are named.MacKean p6 Odo had built the first castle at Rochester in 1067. After the trial of Penenden Heath he continued as Earl. However, in 1082 he fell from power, was disgraced and imprisoned. His English estates reverted to the Crown and he was stripped of the Earldom of Kent. William I on his deathbed was persuaded to release Odo and he returned to the earldom. He raised a rebellion against William Rufus in support of William's brother Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy. The rebellion failed, but Rochester came under siege in May 1088. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. Finally the defenders capitulated and Rochester castle was abandoned temporarily. In return for a manor, the king persuaded Lanfranc and Gundulf to rebuild Rochester Castle on its present site. This first stone castle defined the site but did not include the large keep. In the 19th century a further catalogue of the cathedral library was discovered, by 1202 there were 280 volumes. By this date a distinctive \\"Rochester Script\\" had evolved and the names of some of the early scibes are known.MacKean p9 Rochester Castle was granted to the archbishops of Canterbury in perpetuity by King Henry I in 1127. The first archbishop to hold it was William de Corbeil, who was responsible for building the keep. The keep so dominated the skyline that it was even incorporated into the town's seal in the 13th century. During the reign of King Stephen (1135‚Äì1154) there was a period of civil war known as The Anarchy. Rochester escaped direct military action, but the widespread lawlessness and settling of local scores left its mark. Afterwards, one third of the tax on the city was remitted \\"on the grounds of waste\\".Poole p153 Later Middle Ages The round tower (centre) was a replacement built by Henry III to repair the damage done to the keep by King John's mine. In contrast to the other two towers visible, it is cylindrical. In early 1215 the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Stephen Langton, temporarily ceded control of the castle to King John. The royal constable, Reginald de Cornhill, took control. In June 1215 the barons met King John at Runnymede and agreed the treaty later known as the Magna Carta. Shortly afterwards the agreement between Langton and John was dissolved, apparently de Cornhill switched sides and remained constable. Shortly afterwards civil war broke out and rebels marched to Rochester to secure the castle. It appears that the King demanded that Langton hand over the castle, but Langton refused. The rebels feared that he would eventually capitulate and so seized control of the castle to prevent this, apparently with the consent of de Cornhill. Langton fled, the King regarding him as a \\"notorious traitor\\".Brown p.12 cited in Rochester Castle John rode to Rochester, sending forces ahead of his caravan to secure the city. The royal forces entered with the element of surprise on 11 October, the king arriving two days later. The castle was invested and a siege begun. To prevent relief forces arriving the bridge was pulled down. The assault began with siege engines unleashing a barrage of missiles against the curtain walls which were breached by mining rather that assault. The defenders retreated into the keep which withstood the siege engines. The south-east corner of the keep was undermined and the pit props soaked in pigs fat. When set alight the resulting fire collapsed the mine and brought down the turret. The defenders retreated behind the great stone diving wall in the center of the keep. On 30 November the defenders finally surrendered. The cathedral was being developed in this period. In 1227 a new Early English quire was completed to replace the original Norman one. In 1343, under Bishop Hamo de Hythe, the central tower was raised and four bells (called Dunstan, Paulinus, Itamar and Lanfranc) hung there, possibly transferred from the original camponile now known as \\"Gundulf's Tower\\", or possibly recast from the original metal. In 1264 civil war broke out between those loyal to King Henry III and the baronial forces led by Simon de Montfort. Rochester's constable in 1264, Roger de Leybourne, held the castle in support of Henry. A baronial army marched from Tonbridge and to deny them cover or shelter the royalist garrison set fire to the city suburbs. Simon de Montfort led an army from London which crossed the river after some fighting. When they entered Rochester the cathedral was raided. the following day the curtain wall was breached and the defenders retreated to the keep. Just as in 1215 siege engines were set up but could not break the keep. The siege was abandoned on 26 April when the earls received news of a relief force led by Henry III and his son, Prince Edward. Rochester suffered from the plague, as did the rest of the kingdom, in 1376. In 1381 the castle saw fighting for the final time during the Peasants' Revolt. It was besieged and captured by a group of rebels who plundered the castle and released a prisoner. Accounts dating from 1339 reveal that the bridge was decaying, this appears to have been a 12th-century replacement for the AD 960 rebuild. In 1339 the bridge was broken down for 24 weeks. Subsequently, on several occasions, a ferry had to be hired, so dangerous had it become. During the thaw of 1381 the pressure of ice finally demolished the old bridge. A new stone bridge was opened in 1392 which lasted until the 19th century.The Medieval Bridge Subsequent to this The Rochester Bridge Trust was established to take over responsibility for the upkeep. The trust was founded by Sir Robert Knolles and Sir John de Cobham and granted its charter from King Richard II. Subsequent benefactors included Ricardo Hwytynton, the real life \\"Dick Whittington\\".Harrison & Evemy pp10-11 The money came, and comes, from property rents. In 1461 King Edward IV granted Rochester a charter in recognition of its loyalty to the crown. The former post of bailiff became that of mayor and the inhabitants were recognised as \\"citizens\\", that is the town was recognised as a city. The first mayor was William Mungeam who was allowed ¬£10 for providing a celebratory supper for the freemen.Harrison & Evemy p 3 In 1470 the great window at the cathedral was completed. Rochester Cathedral, although one of England's smaller cathedrals, thus demonstrates all styles of Romanesque and Gothic architecture. Modern Tudor and Stuart periods In a period of religious conflict, Rochester had a connection with martyrs on both sides of the conflict. From 1504 to 1535 John Fisher was Bishop of Rochester. He was subsequently appointed a cardinal and executed by Henry VIII because he refused to sanction the divorce of Catherine of Aragon. He was canonised in 1935 as a Roman Catholic saint. Shortly afterwards, between 1547 and 1550, Nicholas Ridley was bishop. He was executed by Queen Mary, for demands of faith, becoming a Reformation martyr. Fisher was not universally popular however. One John Roose was convicted of putting poison in a pot of broth intended for him and for the poor of the parish. This so incensed Henry that a special act was passed in 1530 by Henry to have Roose boiled alive as a form of execution. On New Year's Day 1540 Henry VIII met Anne of Cleves at Rochester and was \\"greatly disappointed\\".Mackie p404 Whether connected or not, the old Priory of St Andrew's was dissolved by commission later in the year, one of the last monasteries to be dissolved. The monks and canons became a chapter of secular clergy with the prior as the first dean.Mackie p398-9 With no monastery to run the cathedral school it was refounded by charter from Henry, becoming \\"The King's School\\". The dissolution brought about a dispersal of the cathedral library. At the time many Germans were buying up the manuscripts which were being sold off with all of the monastic property. in 1536 John Leland wrote to Cromwell entreating him to extend Leland's activities so that he could collect manuscripts for King Henry's library. Only in part was he successful. There are now 99 manuscripts from Rochester in the Royal Collection.MacKean p12 A further 37 books have been traced. The majority are in collections in England, but some have travelled as far as Berlin, Brussels and Rome. One now resides in San Marino, California. The Poor Travellers' House In 1579 Richard Watts died, his will was to have long lasting consequences for Rochester. The will established the Richard Watts' Charity which still functions. The most famous part of the will provided for the extension of an existing almshouse by providing overnight accommodation for six poor travellers. The travellers were allowed to stay overnight only (unless they were ill) and were sent on their way with 4d (1.6p), increased in 1934 to 1/- (5p).Richard Watts' Charity The house finally closed its doors to the travellers in 1940 when the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939 prohibited casual wayfarers in this Protected Area.Richard Watts' Charity, though note that the pamphlet cites the Defence of the Realm Act which was the 1914 equivalent. The rest of the house continued to be used as an almshouse, in 1615 becoming an orphanage. In 1653 it became a prison which (with interruptions) it remained until 1793 The charity itself has provided more almshouses around the city which house 100 elderly people.Harrison & Evemy p 30 The charity has also supported in some measure both the Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School and The Rochester Grammar School (see below). In 1648 at the start of the Second English Civil War, Rochester was at the centre of a Royalist uprising. At the time this was thought to be the most threatening such uprising and so Lord Thomas Fairfax was sent to suppress it. He wished to avoid a forced crossing of the Medway over the narrow Rochester Bridge and so marched to the south, crossing the river near Maidstone thus provoking the Battle of Maidstone. By the time Fairfax approached Rochester Lord Norwich had marched off towards London, and Rochester itself was spared a battle.Adair p223 The bridge did not get off as lightly as the town however, the retreating Royalists destroyed the drawbridge section of the bridge and threw the planks into the river.Harrison & Evemy p12 In another contrasting pair of events, Rochester houses saw one king restored and another abdicate. Sir Francis Clarke entertained King Charles II on the eve of his restoration to the throne on 20 May 1660. Following this, his home in Crow Lane became known as Restoration House. It is reputed to be the basis of Satis House in Great Expectations by Charles Dickens. There actually is a Satis House nearby, once the home of Richard Watts. Elizabeth I stayed there as a guest and on being asked if she was comfortable replied \\"satis\\" (enough).A Walk around the City of Rochester Pepys visited Restoration House in 1667 and noted: \\"...a fine walk, and there saw Sir F Clerke's house which is a pretty seat, and into the cherry garden...\\".Pepys, entry for 30 June 1667 (quoted in Restoration House) Shortly after the restoration, Samuel Pepys visited Rochester Cathedral on his way between the London and Chatham dockyards. The cathedral had fallen into disrepair during the Commonwealth and Pepys observed it was \\"now fitting for use, and the organ then a-tuning\\".Pepys, entry for 10 April 1661 Even though the defences of Chatham had been strengthened by the construction of a fort at Upnor on the Hoo peninsular the Dutch launched a raid on 11 June 1667 as part of the Second Anglo-Dutch War. Under de Ruijter they broke through the chain at Upnor and sailed to Rochester Bridge capturing and firing the English fleet.The Dutch Raid Trophies from the raid are in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. Rochester Guildhall on the High Street. Somewhat more peacefully 1687 saw the construction of the Guildhall, part financed by Sir Joseph Williamson FRS with the ceiling being given by Sir Cloudesley Shovell.Plumb p91 The weathervane is of later work having been first erected in 1780. It is a gilded model of an eighteenth-century fully rigged ship. Subsequent work on it has been limited to repairs following storm damage. Nearly 30 years after the restoration, King James II and VII spent his last night as king during December 1688 at a house in the High Street which became known as Abdication House. As of 2011, Abdication House is now the Rochester branch of Lloyds Bank. Georgian and Victorian Rochester Corn Exchange on the High Street. In 1698 the Corn Exchange was started, but as the butchers' market. The present frontage was the gift of Sir Cloudesly Shovell. The existing clock dates from 1771 and replaces an earlier square one. Shovell also left money in his will (1701) to found the Mathematical School. The school specialised in teaching navigation and mathematics to the sons of freemen of the city of Rochester, the Chatham Naval Dockyard being nearby. It is now the town's grammar school for boys, though girls are admitted to the sixth form. In 1792 Daniel Asher Alexander was appointed as architect by the Bridge Wardens. He set about widening the bridge from to . The drawbridge was an obstacle to this so it and one adjoining arch were combined into a single arch. The work took 30 years to complete and cost ¬£20,000. During the Napoleonic wars a ring of forts was built around the Medway area: Fort Clarence, Fort Pitt, Fort Amherst and Fort Gillingham. In the light of the report by The Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom a further ring of \\"Palmerston\\" forts was built during the 1860s: Fort Borstal, Fort Bridgewood, Fort Luton, and the Twydall Redoubts, with 2 additional forts on islands in the Medway, Fort Hoo and Fort Darnet. The forts were to protect the important naval dockyard at Chatham. The first sailing barges were built around 1815 which superseded the earlier bawley and doble boats. Crewed by one man and a boy they were up to long and carried between 70 and 120 tons. By mid-century 2,433 barges were registered in Rochester alone. The barges were able to navigate upstream of Rochester bridge by the simple expedient of lowering the mast.Harrison & Evemy pp7-8 In 1816 the young (four-year-old) Charles Dickens moved to Rochester. Although he only stayed a while, he was drawn back in later years, making his residence from 1856 at nearby Gad's Hill near Strood.Harrison & Evemy p4 Less than two decades after the Alexander improvements to the bridge it was again considered unsatisfactory. The problem this time was the large number of narrow arches which provoked a rush of water as the tide surged in and out. Tides at Rochester can reach which taken with the size of castle reach and the length of the tidal river above the bridge leads to a significant race.Harrison & Evemy p7 In 1839 Sir William Cubitt proposed a bridge of three piers only. Three of the gaps were bridged by cast iron spans, the fourth by an opening section for shipping. The bridge was opened in 1856.The Victorian Bridge At the same time the parallel railway bridge was constructed, and so the shipping channel was never used.The Old Bridge. Note that \\"old\\" means the older of the two existing bridges. The cast iron arches were replaced by the present steel structure in 1914.Harrison & Evemy p13 In 1850 Thomas Aveling, financed by his father in law, bought a small millwrighting shop in Edwards yard where he set up a business producing and repairing agricultural plant. In 1861 he went into partnership with Richard Porter and moved the business to Strood. Aveling & Porter become the largest manufacturer of agricultural machines and steam rollers in the country. Of the 12,700 steam engines which they made, no fewer than 8,600 of them were steam rollers.Bonnett The castle had been in the hands of the Weldon family since the 16th century. In 1870 the corporation leased the grounds to provide a park and then purchased them outright in 1884. In 1965 ownership was vested in the state (today represented by English Heritage) but since 1995 management of the grounds has reverted to the council.Harrison & Evemy p25 In 1888 the lack of a girls grammar school was remedied: the Rochester Grammar School for Girls (after 2006 Rochester Grammar School) was founded. On 1 March 1892 Rochester railway station opened, giving rapid access to London. 20th and 21st centuries Short Sunderland MkI in flight During the First World War the Short Brothers' aircraft company manufactured the first plane to launch a torpedo, the Short Admiralty Type 184, at its seaplane factory on the River Medway not far from Rochester Castle. In the inter-war period the company established a world-wide reputation as a constructor of flying boats with aircraft such as the Singapore, Empire 'C'-Class and Sunderland. During the Second World War, Shorts also designed and manufactured the first four-engined bomber, the Stirling. Following the second world war the bridge was again at its maximum capacity. During railway rivalry a second rail bridge had been built between the old bridge and the existing railway bridge. This had been unused since the 1920s. In 1957 the Rochester Bridge Trust proposed converting it to a road bridge. Construction finally began ten years later, completed in 1970. The new bridge carries two lanes of east-bound traffic, the old bridge now carries two lanes of west-bound traffic.The New Bridge In the local government reorganisation of 1974 the City of Rochester was merged with the borough of Chatham and part of the Strood Rural District including the Hoo Peninsula. The resulting district was the District of Medway. The district sought and obtained a charter making it a borough, thus preserving the mayoralties of Rochester and Chatham. The area of the former City of Rochester was permitted to continue styling itself City under letters patent. In 1979 the borough council passed a resolution renaming itself as the Borough of Rochester-upon-Medway. In 1982 further letters patent extended city status to the whole borough making it the City of Rochester-upon-Medway. The decline in naval power and in shipbuilding in general led to the government abandoning the shipyard at Chatham in 1984, and the subsequent demise of much of the marine industry. Rochester and its neighbouring communities were hit hard by this and have experienced a painful adjustment to a post-industrial economy, with much social deprivation and unemployment resulting. On the closure of Chatham Dockyard the area saw an unprecedented surge in unemployment to 15.9%. This had dropped to 3.5% in 2004. The former dockyard has seen a renaissance as the Chatham Historic Dockyard, a museum dedicated to the Age of Sail, though containing much else from the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1998 the Medway Towns formed the basis of a new Medway unitary authority. The City of Rochester merged with Gillingham and Chatham. The outgoing council neglected to appoint ceremonial \\"Charter Trustees\\" to continue to represent the historic Rochester area, causing Rochester to lose its city status ‚Äì an error not even noticed by the council for four years, until 2002.BBC (2002)BBC (2008) Notes Bibliography    * * Category:Rochester, Kent Rochester Rochester ","title":"History of Rochester, Kent"},{"id":"33973726","text":"Postville (formerly known as Stewart) is an unincorporated community located in the town of York, Green County, Wisconsin, United States.

The pledge was first offered in 1987 at colleges and universities in the United States, and has since spread to some institutions in other countries. Wording and meaning The Pledge states: I pledge to explore and take into account the social and environmental consequences of any job I consider and will try to improve these aspects of any organizations for which I work. The purpose of the Pledge is to encourage graduating students to be aware of the social and environmental impact of their employment as they enter the workforce or continue their education, though it is left to students to define for themselves what \\"socially and environmentally responsible\\" means. Students who voluntarily sign the pledge seek out employment that reflects their values, sometimes turning down jobs with which they do not feel comfortable. Others find employment and then work to make changes in their workplaces. Some examples include promoting recycling at their workplace, removing discriminatory language from training materials, working for gender equality in athletics, and helping to convince employers to reject contracts that would clearly have negative impacts on society or the environment. History The pledge was first established at Humboldt State University, California, in 1987. Manchester University in Indiana hosted the effort from 1996 to 2007, at which time Bentley University near Boston became the host. The project takes shape in different ways depending on the institution. At some colleges, for example, students sign wallet-sized cards with the pledge written on them that they can keep as a reminder of the commitment they've made. Some institutions put the pledge into the formal program for their commencement ceremonies. At other institutions, pledge signers wear green ribbons or green tassels at commencement to signify their commitment (some schools use a different color of ribbon). At Bentley University the pledge is a \\"capstone\\" of its four-year Civic Leadership Program, and at Humboldt State University, the student government funds a student pledge coordinator internship. Impact The pledge serves to promote social and environmental responsibility on three different levels: Students and alumni who are making choices about employment; schools including values and citizenship in their curriculum as opposed to just knowledge and skills; and the workplaces and wider society being concerned about issues beyond just the bottom line. The Graduation Pledge Alliance maintains a web site for campus organizers and those who have signed the Pledge. Extent Over 100 universities and colleges as well as some high schools use the pledge to some extent. There are several different types of schools involved, including: * Liberal arts colleges such as Manchester University, Juniata College, Muhlenberg College and Hartwick College. * State universities such as the University of Colorado, Boulder and the University of Florida. * Private research universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University. * Private graduate schools such as Antioch University New England. * Faith schools such as Goshen College and Bethel College. * Community Colleges such as Estrella Mountain Community College, Mesa Community College and Broward College. * Professional schools such as the Fashion Institute of Technology. * Schools outside the U.S. such as Trent University and the University of Saskatchewan in Canada and the Chinese Culture University in Taiwan.

Hamarkameratene is a professional association football team from Hamar, Norway. It was established in 1946 as a merger between Briskebyen Fotballag (established in 1918 as Freidig) and Hamar Arbeideridrettslag. In 1970, the team qualified for the First Division, and has since been in the top three flights of Norwegian football. They play their home games at Briskeby Arena, built by the club between 1934 and 1936. Early years Briskebyen Fotballag Freidig was established on 10 August 1918 as a local team for Briskebyen in what was then the municipality of Vang.Gjerd√•ker (1998): 52 The prerequisite for joining the team was being able to pay for the football. At the time there was a severe lack of pitches in Hamar, and the club would to begin with often sneak into unused venues and play until they were chased by the groundskeeper. Freidig applied for entry into the regional series in 1926, but were only admitted after their second attempt, in 1927. At the time a club by the name of \\"Freidig\\" was already playing in the series, so the boys from Hamar were forced to rename their team. The natural choice was Briskebyen Fotballag (Briskebyen Football Team), Briskeby being the name of their neighborhood. Briskeby during a match in the 1930s This forced it to formalize its pitch renting to have a single home venue. In 1928 and 1929, it played at Vangsbanen, from 1930 through 1933 at Ottestad bane, and from 1934 at Hamar stadion. The club was dissatisfied with this arrangement and started working with plans to establish its own venue. The decision to build the venue was taken by Briskebyen FL's annual meeting on 15 April 1934, with construction starting on 26 April. The venue opened on 28 June 1936, having cost 32,036 Norwegian krone (NOK). Hamar Arbeideridrettslag Merger In 1946, Briskebyen Fotballag joined up with the multimodal sports club Hamar Arbeideridrettslag (Hamar Workers' Sports Club) to form Hamarkameratene (literally meaning \\"Comrades of Hamar\\"). Because of the general reconciliation between bourgeois and workers' sports clubs, it was the wish of the municipality that all the sports clubs in Hamar merge, but in the end only these two clubs, who shared a common political viewpoint, were able to reach an agreement. The first manager was Roy Wright, a former Wolverhampton player. His experience from English football, however, did not benefit the club and he was considered a disappointment. The Czechoslovakian, Willem Cerveny, on the other hand, proved to be an influential asset to club and the development of a football culture in the region. Elite team The first half of the 1970s was the club's most successful period to date. Having won promotion to the First Division for the first time in 1969 (the highest level in Norway at the time), the green and white placed third overall in their first season, as well as reaching the semifinals of the Norwegian Cup. HamKam remained a stable contender in the 1st Division until 1974, when they were relegated. The club would earn promotion to the highest division three more times before 1980. The '80s continued in much the same fashion as the latter part of the '70s, with the club going back and forth between the two top levels in Norwegian football. In 1984, a new stand with a capacity of 2,346 was constructed at Briskeby. The new stand became a financial burden for the club. Operating costs increased after Norwegian clubs were allowed to wage players from 1984. In addition, interest rates rose quickly, making the club unable to meet its financial obligations. At the same time, the club experienced falling attendance. In 1985, the club's auditor warned that the club was heading into financial distress.Gjerd√•ker (1998): 225 In 1986, the club spent NOK 1 million to build terraces between the club house and the pitch on the northern short side, and terraces on the southern short side. In 1990, Hamar Municipality gave Ham-Kam a grant of NOK 1.7 million in an attempt to save the club's finances. A measure of success was still achieved, however, the club reaching the semifinals of the cup in 1987 and 1989. A successful season in 1991 saw Hamarkameratene once again win promotion to the highest division (now called Tippeligaen/Norwegian Premier League), under Swedish coach Peter Engelbrektsson. The club managed to avoid relegation in 1992 by virtue of a better goal difference, and entered into 1993 with renewed confidence. After a slow start, the team began climbing towards the top, and were in reach of second place and even the championship towards the end of the season, but with a slump in form a fifth place was the still-positive end result. On 20 October 1993, the municipal council voted in favor of purchasing the stadium. The proposal was supported by the Labour Party and Centre Party, who had 28 of 49 councilors, but opposed by the rest of the council. HamKam spent another two years in the Premier League before entering a recession. In 1994, the municipality bought the stadium to remove the debt which had nearly bankrupted the club. Coach Engelbrektsson left after relegation to the 1st Division in 1995, and the club failed to earn promotion in 1996 and 1997. Serious financial problems emerged at the beginning of 1998. This time a group of private investors prevented bankruptcy, but HamKam were unable to even retain their spot in the 1st Division and were relegated to the 2nd Division. Promotion back into the 1st Division was won the following season, and a slow process followed to rebuild the team. In 2001 the club nearly made it back to the Premier League but lost the playoff against Bryne. The following season was a disappointment, however, with only eighth place to show for, and the club was yet again experiencing financial problems. New stadium and collapse After struggling for seven years, the hiring of St√•le Solbakken as the team's coach before the start of the 2003-season marked the beginning of another short stay at the top of Norwegian football for the green and white. Having won the 1st Division in 2003, they entered the Premier League for the first time since 1995. The first season in the top flight in eight years was a formidable success. Under Solbakken's leadership, HamKam were in contention for a spot among the final four and a place in the UEFA Cup qualifying rounds. They would eventually end the season in fifth place. Thought by many to be unable to cope in the company of wealthier clubs, this was an impressive feat by the team with the second-smallest budget of them all. Expectations were high in 2005, but despite early prospects of a good season (in their first game, they defeated would-be champions V√•lerenga), HamKam were unable to perform consistently and ended up in a disappointing tenth place. Soon after, Solbakken announced that he would be leaving the club to become manager of FC Copenhagen. His was succeeded by the former Norwegian national goalkeeper Frode Grod√•s. Solbakken's tenure at Hamarkameratene had left the club in a much improved state from prior to his arrival. Gone were the financial problems that had plagued the club for two decades. People were once again coming to see the team play, with attendances now averaging more than 5,500, a number not seen since the '70s. Fans of the club had even gone as far as to nickname their manager St√•le \\"Salvatore\\" (\\"the saviour\\") in recognition of his achievements. His successor failed to capitalize. HamKam picked up where they left off in 2005, scoring some spectacular wins against top teams while again being unable to perform consistently. As the season neared its end, however, Frode Grod√•s failed where Solbakken had succeeded, namely in keeping HamKam away from the relegation zone. Going into the final round of the season, they found themselves third from the bottom of the table and in need of a win. HamKam instead suffered a humiliating 1‚Äì5 loss at home, dropping to 13th place and relegation in 2006. As a result of this, the board decided to fire Grod√•s from his position as head coach, and on 13 November Arne Erlandsen was hired as his replacement. Vegard Skogheim, a long-time favourite amongst the fans, was hired as assistant coach. HamKam returned to Premier Division in 2007 but relegated again to First Division as 14th or last in 2008. HamKam slipped down to Second Division as 13th after losing 1‚Äì0 away match against Sparta Sarpsborg in 2009. By 2001 NFF was in the process of implementing new stadium requirements in the top leagues, and Briskeby would no longer be permitted to be used in the top tier.Lynx (2011): 33 In 2004,Lynx (2011): 87 Biong Arkitekter was contracted to design the stadium, with Bygger√•d as structural engineers.Lynx (2011): 162 Hamar stadion and the neighbor lot Fuglsetmyra was sold for NOK 295 million in June 2007.

Stage one cost NOK 92.5 million to build and NOK 19 million for purchase of real estate.Lynx (2011): 262 In the 2010 season, Ham-Kam played in the Second Division, resulting in the entire VIP area remaining unused. In the 2010 season, HamKam won its section of the Second Division and won promotion back to the second tier. However, economic problems came to a head, and on 21 December 2010, the board announced that the club had decided to file for bankruptcy on 30 December, unless fresh funds were raised by that time.\\"HamKam vil begj√¶re seg konkurs - h√•per p√• hjelp\\" [HamKam will file for bankruptcy - hopes for help], Aftenposten 21 December 2010, in Norwegian Artificial turf was laid on the stadium in August 2011.

Moreover '(0) = with 0 <  < 1\\\\. proved that there is a unique holomorphic function h defined on D, called the Koenigs function, such that (0) = 0, '(0) = 1 and Schr√∂der's equation is satisfied, : h(f(z))= f^\\\\prime(0) h(z) ~. The function h is the uniform limit on compacta of the normalized iterates, g_n(z)= \\\\lambda^{-n} f^n(z). Moreover, if is univalent, so is . As a consequence, when (and hence ) are univalent, can be identified with the open domain . Under this conformal identification, the mapping becomes multiplication by , a dilation on . Proof *Uniqueness. If is another solution then, by analyticity, it suffices to show that k = h near 0. Let :: H=k\\\\circ h^{-1} (z) :near 0. Thus H(0) =0, H'(0)=1 and, for z  small, ::\\\\lambda H(z)=\\\\lambda h(k^{-1} (z)) = h(f(k^{-1}(z))=h(k^{-1}(\\\\lambda z)= H(\\\\lambda z)~. :Substituting into the power series for , it follows that near 0. Hence near 0. *Existence. If F(z)=f(z)/\\\\lambda z, then by the Schwarz lemma ::F(z) - 1\\\\le (1+\\\\lambda^{-1})z~. :On the other hand, :: g_n(z) = z\\\\prod_{j=0}^{n-1} F(f^j(z))~. :Hence gn converges uniformly for z ‚â§ r by the Weierstrass M-test since :: \\\\sum \\\\sup_{z\\\\le r} 1 -F\\\\circ f^j(z) \\\\le (1+\\\\lambda^{-1}) \\\\sum M(r)^j <\\\\infty. *Univalence. By Hurwitz's theorem, since each gn is univalent and normalized, i.e. fixes 0 and has derivative 1 there , their limit is also univalent. Koenigs function of a semigroup Let be a semigroup of holomorphic univalent mappings of into itself fixing 0 defined for such that *f_s is not an automorphism for > 0 * f_s(f_t(z))=f_{t+s}(z) * f_0(z)=z * f_t(z) is jointly continuous in and Each with > 0 has the same Koenigs function, cf. iterated function. In fact, if h is the Koenigs function of , then satisfies Schroeder's equation and hence is proportion to h. Taking derivatives gives :h(f_s(z)) =f_s^\\\\prime(0) h(z). Hence is the Koenigs function of . Structure of univalent semigroups On the domain , the maps become multiplication by \\\\lambda(s)=f_s^\\\\prime(0), a continuous semigroup. So \\\\lambda(s)= e^{\\\\mu s} where is a uniquely determined solution of with Re < 0\\\\. It follows that the semigroup is differentiable at 0. Let : v(z)=\\\\partial_t f_t(z)_{t=0}, a holomorphic function on with v(0) = 0 and = . Then :\\\\partial_t (f_t(z)) h^\\\\prime(f_t(z))= \\\\mu e^{\\\\mu t} h(z)=\\\\mu h(f_t(z)), so that : v=v^\\\\prime(0) {h\\\\over h^\\\\prime} and :\\\\partial_t f_t(z) = v(f_t(z)),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, f_t(z)=0 ~, the flow equation for a vector field. Restricting to the case with 0 < Œª < 1, the h(D) must be starlike so that :\\\\Re {zh^\\\\prime(z)\\\\over h(z)} \\\\ge 0 ~. Since the same result holds for the reciprocal, : \\\\Re {v(z)\\\\over z}\\\\le 0 ~, so that satisfies the conditions of : v(z)= z p(z),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\Re p(z) \\\\le 0, \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, p^\\\\prime(0) < 0. Conversely, reversing the above steps, any holomorphic vector field satisfying these conditions is associated to a semigroup , with : h(z)= z \\\\exp \\\\int_0^z {v^\\\\prime(0) \\\\over v(w)} -{1\\\\over w} \\\\, dw.

Autoneum is one of the leading manufacturers in vehicle acoustic and thermal insulation for vehicles and supplies the majority of global automobile manufacturers. Autoneum was founded in 2011 as a spin-off of Rieter Holding AG, currently operates 55 production facilities and employs around 13,000 people worldwide. Autoneum Holding AG is listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. History In 1984, machine factory Rieter took over Unikeller AG, a manufacturer of noise control and thermal insulation systems for vehicles, thus laying the foundation stone for Autoneum. Unikeller AG became a fully owned subsidiary of Rieter Holding AG. This was followed in 1988 by the acquisition of the CHG Group in Rossdorf- Gundernhausen, Germany, AGFK in Sevelen, Switzerland and Sipavel in Set√∫bal, Portugal. In 1994, Firth Furnishings UK, a producer of vehicle carpets, was taken over, and one year later, in 1995, vehicle component manufacturer Globe Industries, USA. Together with this acquisition Rieter also took on UGN, a joint venture of Globe Industries with Japanese automotive supplier Nihon Tokushu Toryo (Nittoku). The Unikeller division was renamed Rieter Automotive Systems in the same year. The last vehicle component manufacturers from Italy and Brazil were purchased in 1996/97 and a joint venture was launched with Magee Carpet Company in the USA. A further joint venture with Nittoku was created in China in 2003 and a Development and Acoustic Center was opened in 2008 in Shanghai, China. The Board of Directors decided to split the Rieter Group in March 2011. The Rieter Automotive Systems division was spun off in May 2011 and entered as a stock-listed automotive supplier under the name Autoneum. In 2012, Autoneum and the Japanese automotive suppliers Nittoku and Toyota Boshoku agreed to collaborate in the development of interior systems for hybrid vehicles. In 2013, Autoneum opened a plant in the Russian city of Ryazan. As part of a move to adjust production capacities to the decline in demand on the European market, the subsidiary Autoneum Italy with plants in Desio, Pignataro, Santhi√† and Vicolungo was sold in the same year. It was also in 2013 that Autoneum engaged in a joint venture with its long-standing partner Nittoku and Chinese supplier TGPM Automotive Industry Group (TGPM). The joint venture company Wuhan Nittoku Autoneum Sound-Proof operates a production site in the Chinese city of Wuhan for the manufacture of thermal and acoustic management components. Autoneum established a further joint venture in 2014 with Korean automotive supplier SH Global. Autoneum Korea Ltd. has its registered office in Incheon, South Korea. In June 2015, the German Federal Cartel Office imposed fines totaling 75 million euros on five automotive suppliers, including the German subsidiary of Autoneum due to illegal price fixing in the period from 2005 to 2013. Autoneum paid a fine of 29.5 million euros. A new Autoneum plant commenced operations in 2016 in the Mexican city of San Luis Potos√≠. Together with the production facilities in Hermosillo and Silao (site of subsidiary UGN), the company therefore has three plants in Mexico and a sales and engineering office in Mexico City. Autoneum founded its ‚ÄúCompetence Center New Mobility‚Äù in the Californian city of Sunnyvale, USA, in 2017, where among other things acoustics and thermal management components for electric vehicles are being developed. In the same year, the company opened its new North America Headquarters in Novi (Michigan), USA. Also in 2017, Autoneum expanded the existing collaboration with Nittoku and Toyota Boshoku with the foundation of a joint venture for research and development in vehicle acoustics. With new plants in Yantai, Changsha, Pinghu and Shenyang Tiexi, the automotive supplier expanded its production capacities in China in 2017 and 2018 to a total of ten locations. Autoneum opened a further production facility in Kom√°rom, Hungary, in 2018. The plant manufactures lightweight components for acoustic and thermal management and is the company‚Äôs sixth Eastern European production site. Production also started in the same year at a second plant in San Luis Potos√≠ so that Autoneum is now represented with a total of five locations in Mexico. Products Autoneum develops and produces lightweight components for acoustic and thermal management for vehicles. These include engine encapsulations, carpet systems and inner dashes for the passenger compartment, underbody systems, wheelhouse outer liners and heatshields as well as dampers.

Plot Seventeen-year-old Murat, from Turkey but living in Berlin, Germany with his mother and older brother Osman, seems to be struggling with his sexuality while Osman, head of the household since the father's death and a taxi driver, strongly urges Murat to lose his virginity to a woman. However, suspecting that Murat is gay and believing that his Turkish background makes him lesser of a person, some boys from Murat's school harass and beat him. Meanwhile, Lola, a Turkish male who dresses as a female, argues with his boyfriend, a ‚Äúmacho‚Äù Turkish male named Bilidikid (Billy), about returning to Turkey. Billy wants Lola to get a sex reassignment (from male to female) and move with him, but Lola refuses, knowing that if he had the surgery, Billy would leave him. After discovering that Lola is his brother who was disowned by Osman and their father for being gay, Murat runs away from home and meets Lola in the bar in which he works. The two begin to develop a relationship, but Lola mysteriously disappears, leaving Murat at the mercy of Billy, who uses Murat in his business of earning money for receiving oral intercourse. Soon thereafter, Lola is discovered dead in a river. Billy convinces Murat that he knows who killed Lola, but thinks that they need to take the matter into their own hands rather than letting the police deal with the matter. Two friends of Lola, who also work at the bar, reveal to Murat that when Osman discovered that Lola was gay, Osman raped her. When Lola stood up to him, Osman threw her out of the house. The friends warn Murat that Billy is the same type of person that Osman is. Murat dresses as Lola, using Lola's red wig to feign his identity. Murat, with Billy lingering in the background, confronts the boys that Billy says are guilty of murdering Lola. After chasing these three boys, Billy castrates one boy and stabs a second one, just as the second boy shoots him, killing them both. Murat is left with the third boy, who says they had no knowledge of Lola's murder. Upon his return home, Murat discovers that Osman was, in fact, the one who murdered Lola. Hearing Murat's accusation and Osman's admittance of guilt, the boys‚Äô mother slaps Osman and, accompanied by Murat, leaves their home, discarding her hijab. Subplot Iskender, a friend of Lola and Billy who is also Turkish, meets a rich German man, Friedrich, for oral intercourse in a park. The two continue to see each other fairly regularly, but Friedrich is far more interested in a relationship than Iskender. However, after the death of Lola, Iskender admits to Friedrich that he would like to have a committed relationship with Friedrich. Friedrich's mother is not pleased with the relationship, as she is protective of her son, and tempts Iskender with more wealth than he has ever known if he will only leave Friedrich. Iskender wants nothing of her money or wealth; he only wants Friedrich. Hearing the love that Iskender has for her son, Friedrich's mother decides that Iskender passed her test and, therefore, approves of their relationship.

Jacobus van Eynden, also known as Jacobus II, the older brother of Roeland, born at Nymegen in 1733, studied art under his father, and painted principally watercolour pictures of flowers, fruit, animals, and views of towns. He, however, devoted a large portion of his time to science. He died at Nymegen in 1824. Frans van Eynden, uncle of Roeland and Jacobus, born at Nymegen in 1694, studied under Elias van Nymegen at Rotterdam. Aided by the counsels of Chevalier Van der Werf, he painted Arcadian scenes, which he executed in the manner of Jan van Huysum, but not with equal perfection. His skies and distances are serene and delicate, and the clouds illumined by the sun are pleasingly reflected in the waters.

On the master classes internationally renowned musicians teach young talented singers and instrumentalists in the field of opera, lied and chamber music. Savonlinna Music Academy originated from Savonlinna Music Days organized by Finnish composer Yrj√∂ Kilpinen in the 1950s. During the Music Days, teaching for young musicians was organized. The history of Savonlinna Music Academy thus goes back to times before Savonlinna Opera Festival made the small town internationally known. Over time the organization has changed, but the main principle of providing quality teaching has remained the same. Currently, master classes are organized within the framework Savonlinna Summer University (open university) teaching. Savonlinna Music Academy is directed by an artistic committee. The chair of the artistic committee is pianist Ralf Goth√≥ni. The managing director of Savonlinna Music Academy Association is operationally responsible for activities. Mainly master classes are organized in July when also Savonlinna Opera Festival takes place. For students this gives the opportunity to meet and hear many artists visiting Savonlinna for the festival. Concerts organized the Music Academy attract people coming to Savonlinna for opera and classical music. Instruction in singing comprises in addition to opera and lied also of teaching for vocalist-piano duos. In the chamber music master classes student and teachers make music together.

In both developing countries and some developed countries found in tropical climates, there is a need to store potable drinking water during the dry season. In agriculture water storage, water is stored for later use in natural water sources, such as groundwater aquifers, soil water, natural wetlands, and small artificial ponds, tanks and reservoirs behind major dams. Storing water invites a host of potential issues regardless of that waters intended purpose, including contamination through organic and inorganic means. Great Nile Dam, at first cataract, Egypt., 1908, Copyright, 1908, by Stereo-Travel Co. Brooklyn Museum Archives Types of water storage Groundwater Groundwater is located beneath the ground surface in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. There are two broad types of aquifers: An unconfined aquifer is where the surface is not restricted by impervious rocks, so the water table is at atmospheric pressure. In a confined aquifer, the upper surface of water is overlain by a layer of impervious rock, so the groundwater is stored under pressure. Aquifers receive water through two ways, one from precipitation that that flows through the unsaturated zone of the soil profile, and two from lakes and rivers. When a water table reaches capacity, or all soil is completely saturated, the water table meets the surface of the ground where water discharge in the forms of springs or seeps. It is also possible to artificially recharge aquifers (using wells), for example through the use of Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR). Soil moisture Groundwater is stored in two zones, one being the saturated zone, or Aquifer, the other is the pore space of unsaturated soil immediately below the ground surface. Soil moisture is the water held between soil particles in the root zone (rhizosphere) of plants, generally in the top 200 cm of soil. Water storage in the soil profile is extremely important for agriculture, especially in locations that rely on rainfall for cultivating plants. For example, in Africa rain-fed agriculture accounts for 95% of farmed land.Finding ways to boost productivity and reduce poverty through better water management in Africa Success Stories, Issue 4, 2010, IWMI. Wetlands Wetlands in Donana National Park (Huelva, Spain) Wetlands span the surface/sub-surface interface, storing water at various times as groundwater, soil moisture and surface water. They are vital ecosystems that support wildlife and perform valuable ecosystem services, such as flood protection and water cleansing. They also provide livelihoods for millions of people who live within and around them. For example, the Inner Niger River Delta in the Western Sahel zone supports more than a million people who make their living as fishermen, cattle breeders or farmers, using the annual rise and fall of the river waters and its floodplains.The Wetlands and Poverty Reduction Project, Wetlands International, 12-2005 Wetlands are basically sponges that capture and slowly release large amounts of rain, snowmelt, groundwater and floodwater. Trees and other wetlands vegetation slow the speed of flood water and more evenly distribute it across the wetland. The combination of increased water storage and flood water hindrances lower flood heights and reduce erosion. Ponds and tanks Detention basins and water tanks can be defined as community-built and household water stores, filled by rainwater, groundwater infiltration or surface runoff. They are usually open, and therefore exposed to high levels of evaporation. They can be a great help to farmers in helping them overcome dry spells. However, they can promote vector-borne diseases such as malaria or schistosomiasis. Detention basins are designed for temporary capture of flood waters and do not allow for permanent pooling of water and therefore do not make viable or reliable sources of water storage. Retention basins are similar to detention basins for flood control management, but are built for permanent pooling to control sediment and pollutants in the flood water. Dams and reservoirs The Hoover Dam In the past, large dams have often been the focus of water storage efforts. Many large dams and their reservoirs have brought significant social and economic benefits. For example, Egypt's Aswan High Dam, built in the 1960s, has protected the nation from drought and floods and supplies water used to irrigate some 15 million hectares. However, dams can also have great negative impacts. Because sediment is trapped by the Aswan High Dam, the Nile no longer delivers nutrients in large quantities to the floodplain. This has reduced soil fertility and increased the need for fertilizer.McCartney, M. and Smakhtin, V. Blue Paper. Water storage in an era of climate change: Addressing the challenge of increasing rainfall variability, IWMI Water stored in dams and reservoirs can be treated for drinking water, but in the past due to poor taxing and high water prices in the US, water supply dams are unable to reach their intended levels of operation. Due to the increased surface area of water that dams create, huge amounts of water is lost to evaporation, much more so than what would have been lost from the river that flowed in its place. Planting basins Rainfed agriculture constitutes 80% of global agriculture. Many of the 852 million poor people in the world live in parts of Asia and Africa that depend on rainfall to cultivate food crops. As the global population swells, more food will be needed, but climate variability is likely to make farming more difficult. A range of water stores could help farmers overcome dry spells that would otherwise cause their crops to fail. Field studies have shown the effectiveness of small-scale water storage. For example, using small planting basins to 'harvest' water in Zimbabwe have been shown to boost maize yields, whether rainfall is abundant or scarce. In Niger, they have led to three or fourfold increases in millet yields.Diverse water sources key to food security: report, Reuters, September 5, 2010 Nyalual Deng Joak carries a distribution of buckets back to her community. As well as constructing latrines and conducting health campaigns, Oxfam provides essential materials such as buckets, soap and mosquito nets that help people store water safely and protect family members from fatal illness.  Contamination  As of 2010, it was reported that nearly half of the global population depends on in-home water storage due to a lack of adequate water supply networks. Many of the in-home solutions have improvised from available materials. It has been suggested that the lack of proper tools and equipment for construction, leads to a system more likely to contain breaches, making them more susceptible to contamination from the environment and users.  Common Factors  * Roofing Materials: In certain parts of the world uncoated lead flashing is used as a roofing material. Researchers found on-site water storage of rainwater was more acidic, and contained elevated levels of heavy metals in a study conducted in Australia from 2005‚Äì2006. * Hand-washing: When water is stored in tanks for consumption hand-washing can become a factor in the tank lacks a proper faucet system, or if there is a lack of education on the risks posed by using hands for water consumption. It was found in a 2009 study that water tanks in Tanzania contained 140-180% more fecal indicator bacteria than the water they were supplied with. * Fertilizer Runoff  Common Risks  * Fluorosis * Arsenic Poisoning * Bacteria and other organic contaminants  Decontamination  In the event that a water tank or tanker is contaminated, the following steps should be taken to reclaim the tank or tanker, if it is structurally intact. Additionally, it is recommended that tanks in continuous use are cleaned every five years, and for seasonal use, annually.https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/environmental- health/dwp/fit/documents/CleaningStorageTanks.pdf # Clean: Drain the tank(er) of any remaining fluid, making sure to capture any hazardous fluid to be properly disposed of. Then scrub the inside of the tank with a detergent, and hot water mixture. # Disinfect: Fill the tank a quarter full with clean water. Sprinkle 80 grams of granular high-strength calcium hypochlorite (HSCH) into the tank for every 1000 litres total capacity of the tank. Fill the tank completely with clean water, close the lid and leave to stand for 24 hours. # Flush: After the chlorine solution has sat in the tank for 24 hours, flush out/empty the storage tank. Do not drain the tank into a septic system or adjacent surface water body. Continue flushing until the waste water is clear and no chlorine odor is detected. # Test: Once the storage tank has been thoroughly flushed, test for free chlorine residual to ensure it is non- detectable. Once a non-detectable chlorine residual has been obtained, collect operational & maintenance (O&M;) total coliform bacteria water samples. If the test results are negative for bacteria, the drinking water is considered safe to use and drink.

Since then, the station has been repeatedly remodelled. The station served regional passenger and freight traffic and was the terminus of a Berlin S-Bahn service from 1950 to 1961. The direct connection to Berlin was lost with the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961. It was restored in 2006. Teltow Station should not be confused with Teltow Stadt (town) station, which opened in 2005 and is near the centre of the town at the end of a branch line of the S-Bahn and about 2 kilometres to the north-west of Teltow station. Location The railway station is located south of Berlin at the intersection of Berlin‚ÄìHalle railway with Mahlower Stra√üe (the road to Mahlow) about three kilometres east of central Teltow in the district of Potsdam-Mittelmark in the state of Brandenburg. Originally, the station was built far outside the town in open fields, but the area between the town and the station is now occupied by housing estates. The locality of Heinersdorf lies two kilometres to the east on the boundary of the Teltow-Fl√§ming district and is part of the Teltow settlement of Sigridshorst, which lies about one kilometre further north. History  The town of Teltow initially had no connection to the Anhalt Railway, which was opened in 1840 and ran a few kilometres to the east of the town. A passenger and postal service was subsequently established towards Zehlendorf station on the Berlin‚ÄìMagdeburg railway. In 1872 the Berlin-Anhalt Railway Company planned a connection from Lichterfelde via Teltow and Stahnsdorf to Potsdam, but this project was not realised. A steam tramway called the Dampfstra√üenbahn Gross- Lichterfelde (Anhalter Bahnhof)‚ÄìSeehof‚ÄìTeltow was opened in 1888; this became part of the Teltow District Railway (Teltower Kreisbahnen) in 1906 and was electrified in the following year. In 1889 there were again plans for a railway from Potsdam via Teltow to K√∂penick, which were also not realised. Later separate sections of the Brandenburg Bypass Railway (Umgehungsbahn) were built that did not run directly to Teltow. In the second half of the 1890s a bigger effort was made to connect the town of Teltow with a fully developed railway. Applications were sent to the K√∂nigliche Eisenbahn-Direktion Halle (Royal Railway Division of Halle), which was responsible for the Anhalt Railway. Once part of the required land was handed over by the town and of the surrounding landowners to the railway company free of charge, construction work could begin.  Teltow station Teltow station was opened for all traffic on 1 October 1901. The volume of traffic developed well with freight rising especially quickly. The station was served from the beginning by all passenger trains operating on the line, which amounted to ten to twelve trains in each direction in 1904. The Teltower Industriebahn (Teltow Industrial Railway, later the Teltower Eisenbahn‚ÄîTeltow Railway) was opened in 1909, connecting the station to various industrial companies in the town and to the port opened in 1906 on the Teltow Canal. In the early 1910s, the station trackwork and the station building were extended. In 1923, responsibility for the railway facilities in Teltow was transferred from the Reichsbahn railway division (Reichsbahndirektion) of Halle to the railway division of Berlin. Moreover, there were plans for the quadruplication of the Anhalt Railway in the Teltow area in order to create separate suburban tracks. The town of Teltow gradually developed towards Teltow station, which it reached by the 1930s. Berlin suburb fares were extended to Teltow in 1938. Conversions in 1940  Former Tls signalbox at the junction to the Gro√übeeren auxiliary marshalling yard As part of the Nazis' Welthauptstadt Germania plan, which was partly based on earlier plans, there were a variety of plans in the 1930s to transform the railway yards in the Berlin area, some affecting the Teltow area. Some of these projects were approved for construction. A new marshalling yard was planned in Gro√übeeren, which would extend between Gro√übeeren station and Teltow station on the east side of the tracks of the Anhalt Railway. Instead of implementing old plans for a bypass railway south of Berlin, it was planned to build the Outer Freight Ring (G√ºterau√üenring) on a route that ran further north than the Outer Ring (Au√üenring) that was built later. The provisional Outer Freight Ring between Teltow station and Biesenhorst (west of Kaulsdorf station on the Eastern Railway) was opened on 16 December 1940. Construction started in 1939 on a railway that ran to Tempelhof from Gro√übeeren station and was used for the construction of Gro√übeeren marshalling yard and the planned locomotive depot at Lichterfelde S√ºd. The Hilfsrangierbahnhof (auxiliary marshalling yard) Gro√übeeren was opened in 1941. As a result of the war these projects were implemented on a temporary basis; more construction projects such as the western extension of the outer freight ring north from Teltow via Stahnsdorf to Potsdam were omitted except for a few early works. Further work was carried out on the Anhalt Railway. Here the local and long-distance tracks were separated in conjunction with the transfer of the tracks from ground level on to an embankment. As early as 1919 there were plans for the building of earthworks to raise the Anhalt Railway between Lichterfelde and Gro√übeeren. This work, however, was delayed for nearly 20 years until it was resumed in 1938. In 1943, the separate suburban tracks from Berlin-Lichterfelde Ost to Ludwigsfelde were put into operation, but electric S-Bahn operations from central Berlin ended at Lichterfelde S√ºd station. Teltow was subsequently served only by suburban trains as the through passenger trains on the Anhalt Railway had resumed stopping only in Ludwigsfelde. After the end of the Second World War The suburban traffic from Lichterfelde to Ludwigsfelde was resumed after the war on 24 December 1945. The border between the Soviet occupation of Berlin and the American zone, which later became the border between East Germany and West Berlin. ran north of Teltow station. Much of the trackwork of the station and the mainline tracks near the station were dismantled as war reparations to the Soviet Union or were used to substitute for other dismantled tracks. From 1950, passengers on trains to Berlin stopped in Teltow station, for which a low-quality track was rebuilt. On 7 July 1951, the DC operations of the Berlin S-Bahn were extended from Lichterfelde S√ºd to Teltow. In this context, the separate suburban tracks from Teltow went to Ludwigsfelde were taken out of service. On 18 May 1952, long-distance transport towards West Berlin was abandoned and the tracks were dismantled. Teltow station was only accessible‚Äîexcept for the S-Bahn tracks‚Äîin both directions via the former construction railway which had been provided during the war with a temporary platform. In addition, since 1951, the suburban trains that had previously run to Ludwigsfelde ended in Teltow. Until the mid-1950s, occasional freight traffic operated towards West Berlin. By 1960, it was clearly established that no more freight traffic would run to West Berlin via Teltow. The DC line of the S-Bahn was powered from a mobile rectifier plant at Berlin-Lichterfelde. A stationary rectifier plant at Teltow station was under construction and was planned to become operational in 1961. After the building of the Wall  The rectifier unit for the S-Bahn was taken out of operation in 1961. The building is heritage-listed. The Berlin Wall completely severed the railway line between Teltow and Lichterfelde. The remaining tracks of the S-Bahn line and the freight railway were blocked and the bridge of the S-Bahn line over the Machnower Stra√üe was dismantled. The rectifier plant was taken out of operation. Teltow station was thus accessible only from Ludwigsfelde and by a connecting curve at Genshagener Heide station from the Outer Ring coming from the west. Its use for passenger services declined sharply as both Berlin and Potsdam could only reached by train with substantial detours. It remained active at first, but trains towards Ludwigsfelde were later thinned (1962: 14 trains; 1989: 6-8 trains per day in each direction), with some trains continuing directly towards J√ºterbog. Immediately after the Wall was built, there were two pairs of trains during peak hour running via Genshagener Heide to Berlin. In 1963 they were discontinued, but a pair of early trains continued to operate to Genshagener Heide until 1983. The majority of passengers used buses that connected Potsdam via Teltow town centre and Teltow station with Berlin Sch√∂nefeld Airport station. In the 1980s, it operated every 30 minutes and between Teltow and Potsdam station it ran every 15 minutes on weekdays. Electrification of the line through Teltow station was completed on 30 July 1982. Development after 1990  Soon after the fall of the Berlin Wall there were requests for the resumption of S-Bahn services to Teltow. However, there were long discussions about whether such a service should run to Teltow station, which was far from the centre of the town, or whether planning started in the 1930s for a new line and a station closer to central Teltow should be resumed. The Federal Ministry of Transport finally agreed in 1997 to finance this line. The Berlin-Lichterfelde S√ºd‚ÄìTeltow Stadt railway and the Teltow Stadt station opened on 24 February 2005. The old Teltow station was still exclusively served in passenger operations by regional trains from Ludwigsfelde, but the service frequency was increased to provide an hourly service from May 1993. Passenger traffic in Teltow was closed on 24 May 1998 because work had begun to rebuild the Anhalt Railway to Berlin; the overhead wire had been dismantled a year earlier. The reconstructed route and the rebuilt Teltow station returned to operation on 28 May 2006. It was rebuilt in an elevated position with parts of the old station retained for freight. Teltow station is served by the RE 4 service from Ludwigsfelde via Berlin to Rathenow every hour. At the beginning and ends of the day this service does not operate, but trains of the RE 5 services, which normally pass through without stopping, stop in Teltow at those times. Infrastructure Initially, the station had two outside platforms on the two through tracks and some tracks for freight on the west side. A small building made of timber and bricks served as an entrance building. Later sidings were added, first one towards Halle, then one towards Berlin in 1920. In 1931 there were extensive freight facilities on the west side of the tracks. The freight shed was located next to the entrance building. To the south, there were a number of sidings, to which the Teltow Industrial Railway was connected. The Tlo signalbox was on the eastern side of the tracks next to Machnower Stra√üe. After 1940  Freight tracks; to the right are the remains of the platform unused since 1998 The embankment for local and long-distance tracks was built on the west side of the railway tracks through the site of the former freight facilities and entrance building. A construction operations station, where freight was handled, was built east of it at ground level. The suburban platform was accessed via a tunnel which initially had one exit on the western side. Once the new works were completed after the Second World War, trains running towards Ludwigsfelde stopped at the former construction operations station. In 1952, the tunnel was extended to the eastern side of the tracks. A small, barracks-like station building was built on the entrance to the lower platform. After the construction of the Berlin Wall, the S-Bahn tracks and the bridge over Machnower Stra√üe were dismantled. The embankment and the tunnel remained until the next station reconstruction in the late 1990s. The station then had a platform with two platform edges for passenger trains. The freight operations area, which had two loading tracks, was located to the east. Current situation  The through station is elevated above Machnower Stra√üe, where it is crossed by the railway tracks. It consists of two platform tracks outside the through tracks, which extend south of the road on both sides and have external platforms. East of the through tracks there are some tracks for freight at ground level. These are connected to Anhalt Railway only in Gro√übeeren station and the freight yard is considered part of the precincts of Gro√übeeren station. Southwest of the station there are still some remnants of the tracks of the Teltow Railway, which are no longer connected to the main line. Access to the Teltow Railway  Beginning of Teltow Railway to the south of Teltow station, seen from the embankment of the former suburban tracks. The route of the Teltow Railway ran from Teltow station to the south and west of the town of Teltow to Teltow port on Oderstra√üe on Teltow Canal. The connection of this freight line to the station has been repeatedly changed. Originally it branched off the Anhalt line at the south end of the station and ran to the southwest. However, the embankment built in 1940 for the planned suburban and long-distance tracks severed this connection. Therefore, a new route was built that branched off to the north of the station and ran to the northwest and under the tracks of the mainline to Berlin. In Sigridshorst, it connected to a western extension from the Outer Freight Ring. The trains of the Teltow Railway reversed in Sigridshorst and ran west of Teltow station along the railway line until they reached the original route. After the Second World War, the railway embankment south of Teltow was no longer needed and partially removed. Since the through connection from Teltow to the north was limited by the new border, it became no longer usable and the Teltow Railway was reconnected at the south end of Teltow station to run towards Gro√übeeren station. Rectifier installation The \\"rectifier installation with courtyard paving and access road and the associated paved section of Bahnstra√üe\\" is heritage-listed. It is located on the western side of the railway tracks. It was built around 1960 and was almost completed in the summer of 1961. Because of the building of the Wall, the S-Bahn line was disrupted and thus the rectifier installation became superfluous. As a result, the technical facilities were dismantled. The construction of the installation has been preserved and is now used as part of a children‚Äôs playground.

The station, which was inaugurated in 1841, is one of the oldest railway stations in the state of Brandenburg. The now disused station building is a listed building. Location  The station is located south of Berlin on the Berlin‚ÄìHalle railway about two kilometres west of Gro√übeeren. It is connected by connecting curves to the Berlin Outer Ring. Federal highway 101 and the Berliner Ring run nearby. History Signal box built in about 1940 At the establishment of the Anhalt line, Gro√übeeren was only a stop for steam locomotives so that they could be resupplied with water. However, from the beginning there was interest in establishing a stop for passengers. Just a few months after the opening of the line, Gro√übeeren station was put into operation on 16 October 1841. Before that, on 29 August, there had been special services there to mark the anniversary of the Battle of Gro√übeeren. The station opened at the same time as the start of freight operations on the line. In the early years the nearby Ludwigsfelde station, which was opened at the same time as Gro√übeeren, was served during the day by just one freight train that also carried passengers; it could be used to travel to Berlin in the morning and to return in the afternoon. In 1849, Gro√übeeren was initially only served in the summer timetable, but soon passenger trains were stopping throughout the year. Initially, the station was called Gro√übeeren, although for several decades from the later 1840s the name was written as Gro√ü-Beeren. The original station building was south of the road to Neubeeren. In 1868, the large station building that still exists was built to the north of the road, but like its predecessor it was built on the west side away from the tracks and sidings. The original building was preserved as a residence and was probably demolished during the construction of additional tracks in 1940. For the extension of the railway station in 1867‚Äì68, part of the Gro√übeeren estate had to be expropriated because its owner, von Briesen, had refused to sell the land. Previously he had been listed as an opponent of the railway. On 1 December 1926, as part of the development of the Bypass Railway, the Michendorf‚ÄìGro√übeeren railway was opened, connecting the Berlin‚ÄìHalle railway to the Seddin marshalling yard. Plans to extend the Bypass Railway from Gro√übeeren to the east were not realised initially. Reconstruction around 1940  Former signal box in the marshalling yard After the coming to power of the Nazis, the government planned as part of the planning for the World Capital Germania, a great transformation of the railways in the Berlin area. Components of this project included a large marshalling yard at Gro√übeeren and new links for freight from there to the northeast (the Outer Freight Ring‚ÄîG√ºterau√üenring) and to the southeast to the Dresden railway near Zossen. These projects were delayed by the outbreak of war and only small parts of them were built. The marshalling yard was opened on a much reduced scale on 15 August 1941 as Hilfsrangierbahnhof (auxiliary marshalling yard) Gro√übeeren; the Outer Freight Ring was also provisional opened on 16 December 1940 with a single track as the Vorl√§ufiger G√ºterau√üenring (interim outer freight ring). Only some preliminary construction of the planned line towards Zossen was completed in 1940. Other projects in the area of Gro√übeeren were a locomotive depot (Bahnbetriebswerk), a local freight yard and a line to the west as an extension of the Outer Freight Ring via Seehof and Stahnsdorf to Potsdam with access to Gro√übeeren marshalling yard. In order to relieve the Anhalt railway of freight, a freight line was planned to be built parallel with it to Tempelhof marshalling yard. First, a construction track was built, which was later used for regular freight operations. The infrastructure of the marshalling yard was extended to the east of the Anhalt Railway for five kilometres as far as Teltow station. For passenger operations, the largest transformations were planned in the area of Gro√übeeren. Among other things, local and long-distance traffic would be separated. New tracks were opened in 1943 to the west of the station for the Anhalt Suburban Line running on an embankment, which were provided with temporary platforms. The original plans envisaged an extension of the Berlin S-Bahn to Ludwigsfelde. This, however, did not eventuate and the S-Bahn was extended only as far as Lichterfelde S√ºd. After the Second World War  After the war, the tracks of the auxiliary marshalling yard and a number of other tracks were dismantled for war reparations. The Anhalt Railway was divided by the establishment of a border between West Berlin and East Germany. Until 1952, through trains ran from Berlin on the Anhalt Railway and until 1961 it was still possible to interchange between the S-Bahn and trains on the Anhalt Railway at Teltow station. Until 1951, local services used the suburban tracks of the 1940s, after that they changed in Gro√übeeren from the tracks originally built for the construction of rail infrastructure to the long-distance tracks of the Anhalt Railway towards Teltow. The tracks on the embankment west of the station were dismantled. The construction of the Berlin Wall created a break in the line for a long time. Gro√übeeren and Teltow were only accessible from the south. From the early 1950s, long-distance passenger services and freight from Berlin to the Anhalt Railway used the Berlin Outer Ring and did not pass Gro√übeeren station. The section of the line that was still open to Teltow and passed through Gro√übeeren station was electrified on 30 July 1982. Since German reunification After fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the lines in the Berlin area were restored. The Anhalt Railway was substantially rebuilt. The Gro√übeeren intermodal freight depot (G√ºterverkehrszentrum, GVZ) has been built on parts of the site of the former rail yard since 1994; its transfer facility went into operation in September 1998. In the same year passenger services between Ludwigsfelde and Teltow via Gro√übeeren were discontinued because of construction work to restore the connection to Berlin. In 2006, the newly built line was restored for through traffic. Gro√übeeren station was reclassified as a halt during the establishment of the GVZ. New platforms were built further south at the small signal box of the former marshalling yard, replacing the old platforms at the station building. Passenger services In the first years of operation, Gro√übeeren was served each day in both directions by one freight train that had some passenger accommodation. In subsequent years, services gradually increased. In 1905, nine or ten passenger trains, depending on direction, stopped in the station, mostly running to Dresden, Leipzig and Halle. Express trains did stop in Gro√übeeren. By 1943, some of the long-distance passenger trains stopped in Gro√übeeren, others ran through. Of those terminating in Trebbin or J√ºterbog, most stopped at the station. With the separation of the suburban services, Gro√übeeren was served from 1943 approximately every 30 minutes by suburban trains between Berlin and Ludwigsfelde, sometimes more frequently during the peak hour; trains on longer routes no longer stopped there. Passenger services towards Berlin ended in 1952 as the Berlin S-Bahn service had been extended to Teltow in 1951. In 1961 with the establishment of the Berlin Wall, the importance of the station for passengers was reduced significantly. The service was usually limited to six or seven pairs of trains between Teltow and Ludwigsfelde via Gro√übeeren, some of which continued to J√ºterbog. After the fall of the Wall the number of train services increased. In 1992, trains ran between Ludwigsfelde and Teltow every two hours and from 1993 they ran hourly. In 1998, passenger services stopped for the reconstruction of the line and were replaced by buses. Since 2006, Gro√übeeren has had a direct hourly service to Berlin. Since the 2011/12 timetable, hourly services of the RE 4 Regional-Express service running from Rathenow via Berlin to Ludwigsfelde (during peak hour to J√ºterbog) stop in Gro√übeeren. In the evenings, this service does not operate, but then RE 5 services stop in the station. Infrastructure  On the left: the new platforms and the old station building. Behind: the former embankment of the suburban railways in 1940. On the right: a former signal box and the tracks to the GVZ. The station building of 1868 is located west of the tracks. It is no longer used and it is heritage-listed along with an outbuilding. Before the remodelling, the station had a platform next to the station building and an island platform, which was offset to the north. On the east side of the tracks, there were facilities for freight transport. For a short time in the 1940s there was a suburban platform on the west side of the station built on an embankment. Current station and junction The tracks of the old station are no longer used. A new station for passenger services has been built south of the station building, which is classified operationally as a halt (Haltepunkt, meaning that it has no sets of points). Gro√übeeren has two external platforms that are 140 m long and a height of 76 cm above the top of the rail. This is served hourly by Regional-Express service RE 4 (Rathenow‚ÄìBerlin‚ÄìLudwigsfelde). In the evening peak hour, when the RE 4 is no longer running, Gro√übeeren is served by RE 5 services. South of the station is Gro√übeeren junction (official railway abbreviation: BGSBS). A branch runs off to the southwest over a connecting curve built in 2006 to Gro√übeeren West junction (BGBW), where a connecting loop built in the 1950s north from the former Genshagener Heide station connects to the Outer Ring in both directions. There is also a branch from Gro√übeeren S√ºd (south) junction to the northeast to the intermodal freight depot (GVZ), which passes to the east of the station. The old link from the Outer Ring to the east of the Anhalt Railway now leads directly to the GVZ. Freight centre Intermodal freight centre The Gro√übeeren intermodal freight centre (G√ºterverkehrszentrum, GVZ), which is of considerable importance for supplying Berlin, was built in 1998 and enlarged in 2005. Its terminal for combined transport is located east of the Anhalt Railway and consists of a container terminal with two gantry cranes, an access road for container trucks and a service centre for containers. There are two tracks with a usable length of 700 m and two tracks with a usable length of 350 m. Each year, up to 100,000 TEU can be handled at the centre. The operator is Deutsche Umschlaggesellschaft Schiene-Stra√üe (DUSS), a Deutsche Bahn subsidiary. Due to its high traffic, a 40-acre extension to the centre was completed in the \\"Am Lilograben\\" area to the west of the Anhalt Railway in 2014. To connect to the existing intermodal terminal, a road bridge was built over the railway line with funding from the European Regional Development Fund. Currently (as of 2014) 6,200 people work in the freight centre.

The station building, which was built around 1880, is a listed building and is the second oldest building in the town. It now houses a museum. Several houses in the railway station area are also listed buildings. Location  The station is located on the railway line between Berlin and Halle (called the Anhalter Bahn‚ÄîAnhalt Railway) south of Berlin. It ran away from major towns. When the station was opened, the only settlements near it were two small localities called Damsdorf and Ludwigsfelde, which were a few hundred metres to the east. The latter settlement gave its name to the station. The present town of Ludwigsfelde was established in the 20th century, and its centre is located to the west of the station. The town of Ludwigsfelde also includes Ludwigsfelde-Struveshof station, which is located on the Berlin Outer Ring to the northwest of the centre of the town. It was opened in 2012 and replaced Genshagener Heide station, which was isolated on the edge of an industrial area at the extreme north of the urban area. Another station, Birkengrund is north of Ludwigsfelde station on the Anhalt line within the town limits. Earlier this station was called Birkengrund S√ºd (south) to distinguish it from Birkengrund Nord (north), which was closed in the 1990s. History  At the opening of Anhalt Railway in 1841 a water station for the supply of steam locomotives was built in Ludwigsfelde as well as in neighbouring Gro√übeeren. With the commencement of freight operations on the line in December 1841, a freight train also carrying passengers stopped at Gro√übeeren and Ludwigsfelde stations. It could be used to travel to Berlin in the morning and to return in the afternoon. The travel time between Ludwigsfelde and Berlin was about three quarters of an hour. At first, patronage in Ludwigsfelde was not strong, unlike in Gro√übeeren, due to the small population nearby, so that the railway company was considering closing the station in 1846. This was prevented by protests by the regional and district councils. In the following period, passenger numbers increased, so that Gro√übeeren and Ludwigsfelde were stops for all scheduled passenger trains from 1849. In the following years, the number of passengers increased significantly. 5,360 passengers were counted at the station in 1852 and there were 31,767 in 1873. The passenger numbers were approximately equivalent to those in neighbouring Gro√übeeren, although the village of Ludwigsfelde had only 122 inhabitants in 1892, while Gro√übeeren still had more than ten times as many people. However, a number of villages in the area were easily accessible from Ludwigsfelde station due to its excellent road connections. Freight traffic also developed to a similar extent: in 1873, 42.430 Zentner (cwt, the Prussian Zentner or hundredweight equalled 51.45 kg) of goods were shipped and 68,175 cwt were received in Ludwigsfelde. Around 1880, a new entrance building was built at the station, which still exists today. This was about 100 metres north of the old station, which was right on the level crossing with the street that is now called Potsdamer Stra√üe. In the area vacated by the relocation of the station, several residential buildings for railway officials were built. Development during the Third Reich  After the station had only local significance for several decades, traffic levels increased significantly in the 1930s. With the opening of the Daimler-Benz car factory in Genshagen, Ludwigsfelde became an important industrial centre and the number of inhabitants multiplied. Genshagener Heide station was first built on the Michendorf‚ÄìGro√übeeren railway for factory workers, but later a new Birkengrund station was built on the Anhalt Railway. During working hours, the trains were stored at Ludwigsfelde station. A staff station for the car factory was built in the Birkengrund area north of Ludwigsfelde station. It was originally planned to build a line for local trains separate from the tracks long-distance passengers trains between Berlin and Trebbin, but this was only completed to Ludwigsfelde by 1943. A separate terminal platform was built on the western side of the railway tracks for services from Berlin that terminated in Ludwigsfelde. Because of the war, the suburban line was electrified only as far as Lichterfelde S√ºd, so commuter trains to Ludwigsfelde had to be switched from the Berlin S-Bahn and then be hauled by steam locomotives. The S-Bahn fare zone was extended to Ludwigsfelde. After the Second World War  The engine plant was closed after the end of World War II and the car factory was dismantled to provide war reparations to the Soviet Union. The VEB Industriewerke Ludwigsfelde was established on the site in 1952 and it developed into a car factory. Ludwigsfelde thus remained an important industrial centre. Due to the growing impact of the division of Germany and division of Berlin, through traffic on the Anhalt Railway to Berlin was blockaded in 1952, as the route ran through West Berlin. Until the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, only S-Bahn services remained in operation to Teltow station, where passengers could change to continue to Ludwigsfelde. Other passenger operations as well as freight traffic used a connection to the Berlin Outer Ring, which was opened in the early 1950s, that had been built to the north of Ludwigsfelde. In the late 1970s, work began on the electrification of the line. The contact wire from the south to Ludwigsfelde was taken into operation on 27 September 1981. This meant that the locomotives on most trains were changed there. The stop to enable the exchange of locomotives was also shown as a scheduled stop for express trains. As of 23 May 1982, electrically-hauled freight trains could continue towards Seddin. The completion of the following sections could not be carried out as planned due to a lack of transformer capacity, but with the commissioning of the catenary to Berlin-Sch√∂neweide on 2 May and to Berlin-Lichtenberg on 30 September 1984, the locomotive change in Ludwigsfelde was largely abandoned. Passenger services Platforms, view to the north Ludwigsfelde was a stop for passenger trains from Berlin to J√ºterbog and beyond during nearly all decades. Express and semi-fast trains did not stop at the station before 1945. From 1943 to 1945 there was dense suburban traffic between Ludwigsfelde and Lichterfelde S√ºd. The trains operated on an approximately equal-interval timetable during off-peak times every hour or every 40 minutes and at peak times every 20, sometimes every 10, minutes. Passenger trains from Berlin to J√ºterbog and further south that did not stop in Teltow and Gro√übeeren during the existence of the separate suburban line stopped in Ludwigsfelde. After the Second World War, the trains towards Berlin were gradually rerouted over the Berlin Outer Ring. Some trains took the new route over the south-eastern section of the Outer Ring, some remained on the old route, but all these trains ended in Teltow station from 1952, where it was possible to change to S-Bahn trains until the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961. While a relatively dense rail service still continued to run to Teltow in the first years after the construction of the wall, the number of trains was reduced over the next seven to eight years on weekdays and on weekends there were even a few less. Approximately the same number of trains connected Ludwigsfelde with Sch√∂nefeld airport, some also continued to Berlin-Sch√∂neweide or other Berlin stations. Most of the traffic between Ludwigsfelde and East Berlin used Sputnik trains running on the Outer Ring from Genshagener Heide station, which was connected by dense bus connections to the main residential areas of the town. On occasion, individual express trains stopped at Ludwigsfelde in the 1970s and 1980s, such as an express from Aue (Sachs) to Berlin.Various timetables After 1990, a more integrated timetable was established. Hourly services ran from the mid-1990s from J√ºterbog via Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld to Berlin- Lichtenberg and further north. Railcars also ran every hour between Ludwigsfelde and Teltow. At times in the 1990s through trains ran from Ludwigsfelde to Potsdam Pirschheide station, but they were discontinued after a few years due to lack of demand. In 1998, the connection to Teltow was replaced by buses for several years during work to upgrade the Anhalt line. After the completion of the work on the line and the completion of the North‚ÄìSouth mainline in Berlin in 2006, through trains ran again on the direct route to the city centre. The regional services towards Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld Airport station were abandoned with the exception of a train on weekend nights. In the 2015 timetable Ludwigsfelde station was served by the following services. The RE 4 service runs every hour between Rathenow via Wustermark, Berlin Hauptbahnhof and Berlin S√ºdkreuz to Ludwigsfelde. In the peak hour it continues to Luckenwalde and J√ºterbog . The 5 RE service runs between Rostock or Stralsund via Neustrelitz, Berlin Hauptbahnhof and Berlin S√ºdkreuz to Ludwigsfelde, continuing via Luckenwalde and J√ºterbog to Lutherstadt Wittenberg and Falkenberg. Both services overlap between Neustrelitz and J√ºterbog, providing an hourly service. The only intermediate stops on the RE 4 service between Berlin and Ludwigsfelde are in Teltow and Gro√übeeren. Infrastructure Entrance building in 2012, to the right an exhibition building is under construction The listed station building, which is located on the western side of the railway tracks, dates from 1886. It is a two-story building of yellow brick with a pitched roof. It was developed on an axis to the south. The building is no longer used for railway purposes. It was renovated and now houses the town museum and Ludwigsfelde technical centre. After 2010 it was supplemented by an annex on its south side. Platforms and tracks  Until the 1930s, there was one side platform next to the station building for the line towards Halle and a small island platform for trains heading to Berlin, which could only be reached by passengers by crossing the track. Behind the passenger facilities there was a freight yard. After 1939, the station has had a side platform on the passing tracks for freight trains, which could be reached by a footbridge. After that the island platform was out of service. In 1943 a suburban railway station was opened on a separate bay platform to the north of the entrance building; on the northeast side of the station tracks there were sidings. After 1945 the terminal tracks were only used for storing carriages. Listed railway workers' residence north of the entrance building The wooden pedestrian bridge was replaced by a steel bridge around 1980 as part of the electrification of the line. It led not only to the island platform but continued to the freight facilities on the east side of the station area. The freight tracks to the east of the station have mostly been removed. After 2000, the footbridge was removed and the island platform has since been reached by a tunnel. Today, the platform next to the entrance building is used for trains heading south and the island platform with its two platform edges is used for trains heading north and for overtaking movements. North of the station building there is still a platform on the track used for overtaking movements, which is used mostly for trains beginning or ending in Ludwigsfelde and running to and from Berlin. This is connected to the main track to the south of the platform next to the station building. By 1980, the signalling systems had been upgraded on the Berlin‚ÄìHalle line in preparation for the electrification of the line. Ludwigsfelde station received a new interlocking of the GS II sp64 class, with an existing signalbox being used as the operations room. Automatic block signalling was installed on the line towards Thyrow. During upgrading the line to 200 km/h, the relay interlocking was taken out of service in 2000 after just twenty years of operation and replaced by an electronic interlocking of the Simis C class. Official residences  Three official residences and an associated stable in the station area are heritage-listed. These are three two-storey brick buildings that date back to 1886.

Produced by Sivaji Ganesan, the film stars himself, B. Saroja Devi, M. R. Radha and Sowcar Janaki, with Nagesh, Manorama, V. K. Ramasamy, O. A. K. Thevar and S. V. Ramadas in supporting roles. The plot revolves around Gopal, who falls in love with Latha, a woman he recently befriended, when his presumed-dead wife Chitra arrives to tell him that she is still alive. He claims her to be an impostor but no one believes him. Puthiya Paravai is the maiden Tamil production of Sivaji Films, later renamed Sivaji Productions, and the company's third overall production after the Hindi films Amardeep (1958) and Rakhi (1962). It is a remake of the Bengali film Sesh Anka (1963) which is itself inspired by the British film Chase a Crooked Shadow (1958). The screenplay was written by Nannu, and the dialogues by Aaroor Dass. Cinematography was handled by K. S. Prasad and editing by N. M. Shankar. The soundtrack album and background score were composed by the duo Viswanathan‚ÄìRamamoorthy while the lyrics were written by Kannadasan. Puthiya Paravai was released on 12 September 1964. The film received positive reviews; critics praised its style, music, and the performances of Ganesan and Janaki, but criticised the comic subplot featuring Nagesh and Manorama. It was also a commercial success, with a theatrical run of over 100 days. Puthiya Paravai was re-released on 23 July 2010 at Ganesan's family-owned Shanti Theatre, and was again met with positive response and commercial success.  Plot  Gopal is a rich businessman en route to India from Singapore on a cruise ship. He meets Latha, another traveller who has been accompanied by her father Ramadurai. Gopal and Latha find that they like each other, so Gopal invites them to stay at his mansion in Ooty, which they accept. One day, Latha discovers that Gopal becomes agitated whenever he sees an onrushing train and demands to know why. He explains that the reason behind this is his first wife. Gopal recalls that, after losing his mother, in sorrow he had been wandering aimlessly at Singapore. He fell in love with Chitra, a nightclub singer, and they married in the presence of her brother Raju. But to Gopal's dismay, Chitra always came home inebriated, and despite his repeated requests, had little respect for tradition and family values. When Chitra showed up drunk for Gopal's birthday party, he tried to control her, but she refused to co-operate; Gopal's father died of a heart attack after seeing Chitra's behaviour. Irritated by Gopal, Chitra later tried to leave him; he caught up and begged her to change her decision, but Chitra berated him for controlling her, and he slapped her. Later that night, he heard that Chitra committed suicide on a railway track, and this hurts him a lot. Latha sympathises with Gopal and accepts his love. The engagement of Gopal and Latha is fixed. While the reception is being held at Gopal's mansion, a woman claiming to be Chitra arrives, accompanied by her uncle Rangan. Gopal's engagement with Latha is cancelled after Rangan convinces everyone that the woman is indeed Chitra. Gopal says she is an impostor and shows Chitra's death certificate as proof, but Rangan reads in the certificate that though the corpse was disfigured beyond recognition, Gopal insisted that it was Chitra so it was declared to be her. Rangan's actions convince Gopal's police officer friend Kumar, although Gopal is adamant that his wife is dead. \\"Chitra\\" and Rangan become disruptive and Gopal gets frustrated, fearing that Latha might leave him because his \\"wife\\" has turned up. After many failed attempts to expose the impostor, Gopal reveals the truth to everyone: when he slapped Chitra, not knowing she was suffering from a heart condition, she died immediately. Gopal realised that he had inadvertently killed his wife. To avoid arrest, and safeguard the honour of his family, he manipulated the murder to appear like a suicide on a railway track and fabricated the necessary evidence to show that Chitra committed suicide. With everyone believing his story, Gopal orders Kumar to arrest the Chitra impostor. However, Latha reveals herself as a police officer investigating Chitra's death based on the complaint filed by Raju, who suspected she could not have committed suicide. Ramadurai is Latha's senior posing as her father, Rangan is the local investigating officer, and the Chitra impostor is Rangan's aide, Sarasa. Together, they staged an entrapment to get the killer's confession because there was no clinching evidence. Latha confesses to a dejected Gopal that though she initially pretended to love him, his good nature impressed her and she truly loves him; she promises that she will wait for him till he returns after completing his jail term. Gopal is relieved, but is still arrested.  Cast  * Sivaji Ganesan as Gopal * Sowcar Janaki as Chitra and Sarasa * B. Saroja Devi as Latha * M. R.

It inspired the Bengali film Sesh Anka (1963) whose screenplay was written by Rajkumar Mitra. The screenplay was acquired by Sivaji Ganesan's company Sivaji Films (later renamed Sivaji Productions) to be remade in Tamil. On 14 April 1963, Sivaji Films announced the remake, titled Puthiya Paravai, with Dada Mirasi as its director. While the screenplay was written by Nannu who also worked as associate director, Shanmugham, a relative of Ganesan, also made inputs to the screenplay, and Aaroor Dass wrote the dialogues. Puthiya Paravai was the third production for Sivaji Films after the Hindi films Amardeep (1958) and Rakhi (1962). K. S. Prasad, N. M. Shankar, and Ganga were hired as the cinematographer, editor and art director respectively.  Casting  While Sivaji Ganesan played the male lead Gopal, B. Saroja Devi was cast as Gopal's love interest Latha at Shanmugham's suggestion. According to Ganesan's eldest son Ramkumar, Ganesan \\"always thought of Sowcar Janaki as classy and sophisticated,\\" which was why he cast her as a \\"modern woman\\" in Puthiya Paravai. \\"Before that Sowcar had only acted in homely roles\\". Janaki was \\"exasperated\\" after acting in so many \\"glycerine-laced tales\\", and readily accepted to act in Puthiya Paravai when approached by Ganesan. Janaki portrayed Gopal's wife Chitra and her decoy Sarasa. Mirasi, who made a cameo appearance as Gopal's father, initially objected to Ganesan's desire to cast Janaki because he felt the actress, then known mainly for sentimental roles, would not fit the stylish character of Chitra. But Ganesan remained adamant as he felt Janaki was perfect as Chitra and was supported by Aaroor Dass, so Mirasi half-heartedly agreed. After seeing Janaki's performance in the song \\"Paartha Gnaabagam Illaiyo\\", he began to appreciate her. Janaki added her own subtle distinctions and inputs to her role as portraying an out-and-out seductive vamp, according to her, would have felt deplorable.  Filming  Principal photography for Puthiya Paravai took place at Neptune Studios and Vijaya Vauhini Studios, though filming also took place at Ooty. It was filmed in Eastmancolor. The majority of costumes were tailored and brought from Singapore and England. On the first day of shooting, Janaki did not like the dress tailored for her, and instead opted for a black sari she bought in Hong Kong a few months earlier. This was the dress she wore during the filming of \\"Paartha Gnaabagam Illaiyo\\" after it was given a little embroidery. The tuxedo worn by Ganesan in the film was ordered from London. For the filming of the song \\"Unnai Ondru Ketpen\\", he smoked so as to set the mood for the song's feel. As Gopal, he did not actually play the piano onscreen, and only gave the impression that he was doing so. For some scenes in the film, Saroja Devi was made to walk with mincing steps and flutter her eyelashes. After the climax was finished, Aaroor Doss immediately requested Ganesan and Mirasi to do the sequence again with the addition of the dialogue \\"Pennmaye! Nee Vaazhga! Ullame Unakku Oru Nanri\\" (). When Ganesan asked the reason for including it, Aaroor Dass mentioned that Gopal would be looked upon by the theatre audiences in a negative light if he did not say anything to confirm his love for Latha. Understanding the dialogue's essence, Mirasi then re-filmed the climax and included it. The film was processed at Gemini Color Laboratory. The final length of the film was over .  Themes  In her 2002 book Cinema of Interruptions: Action Genres in Contemporary Indian Cinema, Lalitha Gopalan noted that the male protagonists in Indian films use the piano to express their desire with no regard to the consequences and cited Sivaji Ganesan in Puthiya Paravai as an example for the same. According to The Hindus Sudhir Srinivasan, the film being titled Puthiya Paravai () reflects \\"Tamil cinema's fascination for fauna when it comes to titles\\".  Music  The film's soundtrack and score were composed by Viswanathan‚ÄìRamamoorthy (a duo consisting of M. S. Viswanathan and T. K. Ramamoorthy) while the lyrics were written by Kannadasan; T. M. Soundararajan and P. Susheela are the only singers featured in the soundtrack. The first song recorded was \\"Chittu Kuruvi\\". \\"Paartha Gnaabagam Illaiyo\\" is inspired by Dean Martin's version of \\"Sway\\". Philips, an autodidact guitarist, played the guitar for \\"Aha Mella\\". \\"Unnai Ondru Ketpen\\" has a ragtime piano introduction while its interlude includes saxophone music. Viswanathan played the piano off-screen for the song. It is set in Harikambhoji, a Carnatic raga. The heavily orchestrated \\"Engey Nimmadhi\\", at that time, had the highest number of instruments used for recording. Choir singers from the Purasawalkam and Vepery areas of Madras (now Chennai) were used in the song. According to film historian and actor Mohan Raman, \\"Kannadasan could not get the right words nor was there a tune ready and Sivaji came to the composing and did a pantomime of what he would like to do and thus was born the line and the song\\". Cellist R. Selvaraj, whose father was a part of the orchestration for \\"Engey Nimmadhi\\" said 250 instrumentalists were used for playing different instruments in sync. Other sources state that Viswanathan used over 300 instruments for the song. Instruments used included the harp, violins, cello, bass, vibraphone, bongos, kettle drums, flutes, castanets, trumpets, tuba, trombone, clarinet and mandolin. Viswanathan‚ÄìRamamoorthy tried over 100 different ways of composing the tune of \\"Engey Nimmadhi\\" before the song was recorded. It is set in Bilaskhani Todi, a Hindustani raga. S. S. Vasan of Hindu Tamil Thisai compared the sombre moments in the song to that of \\"Mujhko Is Raat Ki Tanhai Me\\" from Dil Bhi Tera Hum Bhi Tere (1960). Music director and singer Ramesh Vinayakam said \\"Engey Nimmadhi\\" was an example of \\"the unconscious yet natural and healthy fusion that was happening to cinema music at the hands of music directors.\\" \\"Paartha Gnaabagam Illaiyo\\" was later sampled in \\"Yae Dushyanta\\", composed by Bharadwaj for Aasal (2010). Singer Karthik performed \\"Aha Mella\\" live at \\"Two to Tango\\", an October 2016 concert organised by the Rotary Club of Madras South. The soundtrack received positive response from critics; all the songs were successful, especially \\"Engey Nimmadhi\\". The songs were featured in a charity concert held by M. S. Viswanathan at the Kamaraj Arangam in Chennai on 14 July 2012. Susheela has named \\"Paartha Gnaabagam Illaiyo\\" and \\"Unnai Ondru Ketpen\\" as among her favourite songs that she had recorded.  Release  Puthiya Paravai was released on 12 September 1964, and was distributed by Sivaji Films themselves. It was originally slated to be released in Shanti Theatre, owned by Ganesan and his family. However, the Hindi film Sangam was already running there successfully, and its lead actor Raj Kapoor requested Ganesan to allow his film to continue running at Shanti since \\"no other theatre in the city had such facilities\\". Ganesan obliged, and instead released Puthiya Paravai in the now non-existent Paragon Theatre, which underwent refurbishment for two weeks before the film's screening. Puthiya Paravai did not open well as audiences were unwilling to accept Gopal killing his wife and Latha deceiving him. However, after this the film's reception improved; initially released at only 60 theatres, this was later increased to 100. It had a theatrical run of 132 days at Paragon, 76 days at the theatres Krishna and Sayani, and for eight weeks in all major centres in Madras. Due to its successful run at Paragon, Aandavan Kattalai (1964), which was also running at the same theatre, had to be removed after completing 70 days. Puthiya Paravai was later dubbed in Telugu as Singapore CID.  Reception  Puthiya Paravai received mainly positive reviews upon release. In a review published on the day of its release, the critic from The Indian Express wrote about the film's central mystery, \\"[W]hen it is revealed after seven songs[,] a lot of love-play and familiar kitchen comedy, it loses its suspense and does not amount to much.\\" The critic praised the performances of Ganesan and the supporting cast but criticised the comic subplot featuring Nagesh, the dialogue, lyrics, songs and make-up, and concluded, \\"The photographer and the art director seem to have a weakness for the colour red, but otherwise have done a good job.\\" On 1 October, Dinakaran, writing for the magazine Mutharam, found the film to be truly Hitchcockian. He praised the performances of Ganesan and Janaki, noting that the former pulls it off with effortless ease. He however, criticised Nagesh and Manorama's comedy, finding it dry. On 4 October, Shekar and Sundar of the magazine Ananda Vikatan jointly reviewed the film. Sundar appreciated the cast performances, Mirasi's direction, the photography and the colour, and Shekar was particularly appreciative of Ganesan and Janaki's performances, the night scenes and the set designs, but mildly critical of Nagesh's comedy. Sundar concluded that the film could be accepted intellectually, but found it emotionally tough to accept due to the climax. Writing for Sport and Pastime in a review dated 10 October, T. M. Ramachandran praised the performances of Ganesan as Gopal and Janaki as both Chitra and her decoy, but said there was \\"nothing much to write\\" about Saroja Devi. He said the film's pre-interval portions were generic, but \\"the story begins to grip only after the interval\\" and applauded the twist ending as \\"thought-provoking\\". Ramachandran added that Nagesh \\"fails to provoke laughter with his antics\\", but concluded his review by appreciating the colour processing by Gemini.  Re-releases  Footage from Puthiya Paravai was screened at Ganesan's 80th birthday celebrations held at Kalaignar Arangam, Chennai in 2008. The film was re-released on 23 July 2010 to commemorate the ninth anniversary of Ganesan's death. The negatives of the film were \\"cleaned up at a lab\\" prior to release, and the film was released at Shanthi Theatre, where it could not originally be released in 1964. It earned public acclaim and had a strong opening, running to one- hundred percent theatre occupancy for three days, and became a commercial success. The film was screened at the Russian Cultural Centre Auditorium in Alwarpet on 14 September 2014.  In popular culture  Puthiya Paravai is frequently screened on Tamil television channels, most notably Jaya TV. Many scenes from the film, especially those involving Sivaji Ganesan and Saroja Devi were parodied many times. One notable parody is the comedy track from Guru En Aalu (2009), which featured Vivek and M. S. Bhaskar, who imitate Latha and Gopal respectively. The parody became popular and was frequently screened on comedy channels like Adithya TV and Sirippoli. In Thenali (2000), Kailash (Jayaram) watches \\"Chittu Kuruvi\\" on television but changes the channel after imagining that Gopal's face morphs into that of Thenali (Kamal Haasan). In Siruthai (2011), Kaatu Poochi (Santhanam) watches the film's climax on television before stealing the television set. Scenes from Puthiya Paravai are featured in the film Burma (2014). In the third season of the television show Airtel Super Singer, the show's host Dhivyadharshini and singer Mano imitate Latha and Gopal's mannerisms. Saroja Devi's pronunciation of the name \\"Gopal\\" also attained popularity, and was imitated by Vijayalakshmi (Jyothika) in Kaatrin Mozhi (2018).

Career Initially he played for the Yugoslav second division club FK Novi Sad. He also was lined up for 17 matches of Yugoslavia's Olympic football selection. 1984 he moved to Germany to play as defender for VfR 1910 B√ºrstadt 24 times in the second division, scoring three goals, thereof two penalties. After that season B√ºrstadt was relegated, but ƒêuraƒë Vasiƒá stuck with the club for seven years in the third division. In the coaching career that ensued in 1992, initially in B√ºrstadt, he generally was at the helm of third division clubs. 1994 he started coaching FC Schweinfurt 05 in the fourth division, achieving promotion in 1998 and another one to the second division in 2001. Inside a year though, Schweinfurt was relegated again and he got eventually the sack in November 2002. From 2003 to 2006 he coached third division side SV Wehen, missing out on promotion by only one point in 2005. In October 2006 he was hired by second division side Eintracht Braunschweig as successor to Michael Kr√ºger and interim coach Willi Kronhardt. An exit clause in his contract with Wehen allowed him that move. After five matches without gaining a single point, Eintracht thought it pointless to hang on to him and let him go by November. Eintracht was relegated as dead last by the end of the season all the same. Two more coaches, Willi Reimann and Dietmar Demuth made it altogether five for the season. In 2007, he had a this time short stint with Wehen: already out by mid August 2007. In March 2008 he took on SV Elversberg where he was let go by October 2009. From July 2011 he coached the second team of MSV Duisburg for a year. In 2012 he got a job as sports director supervisor with SV Wiesbaden.

The Zappo Zap were a group of Songye people from the eastern Kasai region in what today is the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They acted as allies of the Congo Free State authorities of the King of the Belgians, while trading in ivory, rubber and slaves. In 1899 they were sent out by the colonial administration to collect taxes. They massacred many villagers, causing an international outcry. Traditional lifestyle According to the missionary William Henry Sheppard, the Zappo Zap people all had tattooed faces and had filed their teeth to sharp points. They dressed only in two minute pieces of palm fiber cloth. They were armed with long spears and with poisonous and steel arrows. Their iron weapons gave them an advantage in warfare, and when armed with guns the advantage was decisive. The Songa people, to whom the Zappo Zaps belonged, also used battle axes (kasuyu or zappozap). The Zappo Zaps worked as mercenaries for whoever was in power. They had been engaged in slave raiding long before the Europeans arrived, burning villages, partly eating bodies and selling hundreds of slaves to the Arabs each year in exchange for guns, ammunition and other manufactured goods. The Zappo Zaps did not restrict their cannibalism to ceremonial occasions, as in other cultures. Instead they hunted humans for food even when other game was plentiful. They considered human flesh a delicacy, and ate all parts of the body, even brains and eyeballs. They fried the meat in the same way as bacon. European contacts The location of Kasai-Oriental, between the Lualaba and Angola. In March 1883 Hermann Wissmann, the first European traveller in the region, gave the name \\"Zappo Zap\\" to a leader known as Nsapu Nsapu who ruled over the town of Mpengie, part of the Ben'Eki kingdom. This was a settlement with more than a thousand people, many of them slave warriors, to the east of the Sankuru River between Kabinda and Lusambo. The group were thriving through slave raiding and trading with caravans from the Arab and Swahili towns on the Lualaba River to the east and from Bihe in Angola to the southwest. In 1883 Zappo Zap felt strong enough to challenge the king of the Ben'Eki, leading to a civil war that drew in all the slavers of the region. In 1886, he was forced to retreat to a location near Lusambo, where he built an impressive station. In 1887 he lost a battle on the right bank of the Sankuru and was forced to cross the river with his 3,000 followers. He met the Congo Free State commander Paul Le Marinel near Lusambo, with Chief Mukenge Kalamba of the Lulua, both retreating westward from the Lualaba. When Herman Wissman met Zappo Zap in 1887 he was dressed with a turban, shirt and pants in the Arab fashion. The missionary Lapsley, who met Zappo Zap's son later, said he had a cloth tied about his head and was clothed from shoulder to knee. Lapsley gave Zappo Zap a gift of brass wire and cloth, and received some young slaves in return. Lapsley appreciated the gift, later releasing the slaves and educating them at the Luebo mission. Zappo Zap died in 1888 and was succeeded by his son, who also came to be known as Zappo Zap, and who moved with all his people to settle near the Luluabourg post in 1889. The second Zappo Zap died in 1894. His brother succeeded him and took the name Zappo Zap, which had become the title of the leader of the Zappo Zap people. In some ways, the Zappo Zaps seemed civilized to the missionaries. They wore Western-style clothing, lived in square houses and could speak both English and French. On the other hand, with their plucked eyebrows and eyelashes, filed teeth and traditions of slaving and cannibalism they were stereotypes of the Western view of African savages. Lapsley said the Zappo Zaps were \\"magnificent men and handsome women, and carry themselves quite as an aristocracy\\". However, he was disturbed by the way in which small girls danced lasciviously in imitation of older women. Colonial allies The Zappo Zap settlement near Luluabourg prospered and the Zappo Zaps became the main allies of King Leopold's forces in Kasai. In 1890 they helped drive Kalamba away from Luluabourg, in 1891 they defeated two Angolan caravans that threatened the post from the south and in April 1895 they again repelled Kalamba from the post. In July 1895 they helped put down a rebellion by the Luluabourg garrison. The Zappo Zaps provided mistresses to most of the Europeans, gaining further influence in the process. They became the owners of large commercial plantations operated by slave labour and engaged in the slave trade to a small extent, which the authorities chose to ignore. But their main commercial activity was the ivory and rubber trade, bringing their goods to the trading centers at Lusambo, Luebo and Bena Makima. Kuba massacre In 1899 the commander of Luluabourg, Dufour, decided to demand rubber from the people of the Kuba Kingdom in payment of taxes. He asked Zappo Zap to provide the force needed. Zappo Zap delegated the job to his ally Mulumba Nkusu. About 500 warriors armed with guns went to the Pyang region of the Kuba Kingdom where they built a stockade. They summoned the local chiefs and demanded sixty slaves as well as herds of goats, baskets of food and 2,500 balls of rubber. When the chiefs refused to pay this huge tribute the stockade gate was closed and the chiefs were massacred. The Zappo Zaps then killed, looted and burned villages throughout the Pyang country. At least fourteen villages were destroyed, and many people fled to the bush in the middle of the rainy season. Dr. William Morrison (left) and Dr. William Sheppard (right) with Bakuba witnesses who traveled to Kinshasa for the 1909 trial against Sheppard and Morrison for libel brought by the Kasai Rubber Company. The Reverend William Henry Sheppard was sent from the Southern Presbyterian mission at Luebo to investigate. Sheppard's journal of 14‚Äì15 September 1899 describes how he pretended to be friendly and through asking casual questions of Mulumba Nkusu, whom he knew, obtained the story of what had happened and was shown the remains. He saw evidence of cannibalism, counted eighty-one right hands that had been cut off and were being dried before being taken to show the State officers what the Zappo Zaps had achieved and found sixty women confined in a pen - the captives were being used as hostages and as sex slaves. The missionaries protested, and to their surprise the Free State officials responded, ordering the release of the women prisoners and the arrest of M'lumba. M'lumba was also puzzled at being arrested, saying he had only done what was asked of him. Sheppard also used a camera to take pictures of a trio of young men and one of the captive women. In January 1900 a member of the Executive Committee for Foreign Missions acknowledged receiving reports and letters about the Zappo Zap atrocities from the missionaries, but reminded the mission of \\"the necessity of the utmost caution, in making representations regarding these matters to those in authority, or in publishing them to the world, to observe all proper deference to 'the powers that be,' and to avoid anything that might give any color to a charge of doing or saying things inconsistent with its purely spiritual and non-political character\\". However, in January 1900, the New York Times published a report giving Sheppard's findings. It detailed the atrocities in the Bena Kamba country and said that the Zappo Zaps were acting for the Congo Free State. It went on \\"They are sent out to collect rubber, ivory, slaves and goats as tribute from the people, and can then plunder, burn and kill for their own amusement and gain\\". The massacre caused an uproar against Dufour and the Congo Free State. When Mark Twain published his King Leopold's Soliloquy five years later, he mentioned Sheppard by name and referred to his account of the massacre. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle mentioned the Zappo Zap in his 1909 book The Crime of the Congo, but said they were forced to extract rubber for King Leopold's forces or they would in turn suffer punishment. Despite the help the Zappo Zaps had given, it was not until 1910 that Leopold's successors, the colonial authorities of the Belgian Congo, had brought the Kuba Kingdom under control and established a military post in the royal capital. The state stopped using the Zappo Zap as auxiliaries and they lost their special position, particularly after the Belgian State took over the colony in 1908. The Songye today are known for metallic decoration on wooden statuary. The Zappo Zap are considered to be the most skillful smiths of the Songye, the most skillful in the DRC and perhaps in Africa.

It is compiled weekly by the Official Charts Company (OCC), and is first published on their official website on Friday evenings. The chart was first launched on 29 June 2009, and, according to Martin Talbot, managing director of the OCC, would have benefited acts such as Friendly Fires and Grizzly Bear. History The UK Indie Breakers Chart runs alongside the similar UK Indie Chart. The UK Indie Chart was created in 1978 by Cherry Red Records founder Iain McNay, and, like the breakers chart, lists only albums and singles released by independent record labels in the UK. Until June 2009, a single was classed as \\"indie\\" if it was shipped by a distribution service that was independent of the four major record companies: EMI, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group and Universal Music Group. Following discussion at the 2008 annual general meeting of the British Phonographic Industry, this definition was altered to include only releases from labels that were at least fifty per cent owned by a record company that was not one of the main four. This prevented major record companies from qualifying for the chart by outsourcing the shipping of their singles and albums to smaller distribution services. At the same time, the UK Indie Breakers Chart was also unveiled, with the objective that it would allow acts signed to independent labels to \\"reach the broader public\\". Any single or album released by an independent label can quality for the breakers charts, provided that the artist has never previously had a Top 20 hit in the mainstream charts. The new indie charts went live on 29 June 2009; at the time, sales from independent labels contributed towards approximately a fifth of sales of albums and singles in the UK. The new charts were received positively by McNay, who remarked that they would, once again, \\"be genuinely independent charts which can help measure the success of, and promote independent records\\". Stewart Green, commercial director of the independent record company Beggars Group also praised the new charts. He stated: \\"This will provide a fascinating snapshot of those slow-burners that do not achieve instant success but sell consistently well over a period of time.\\" Allison Schnackenberg of Southern Records was more critical, remarking that the \\"fifty per cent or more\\" rule was \\"blurring the lines to the point that the word 'independent' will be meaningless to the general public\\".

Vi√∞ √Åir means \\"by the rivers\\" (√° means \\"river\\" or \\"flood\\"; √°ir is the plural form).  Whaling station  The whaling station Vi√∞ √Åir, was the last of seven whaling stations to be built in the Faroes, it was built in 1905 and run by the Norwegian company Chr. Salvesen & Co until 1930. They were not unknown in the Faroes, as they had already in 1897 put money into the station in Nor√∞depil. It is the last of its kind in the Northern Hemisphere, two others remain in the Southern Hemisphere, in Albany, Australia and in Grytviken, South Georgia, out of a total of 214 such whaling stations worldwide built by Norwegians, only these three remain. In 1936 it was taken over by the Faroese company P/F Sperm, and was rebuilt and modernized a bit, at this point there were only two whaling stations left in the country, Vi√∞ √Åir and Lopra. By this time whale stocks in the North Atlantic had diminished and results were not particularly good. In their first year the two boats Falkur and Heykur only managed to shoot 17 whales for the station Vi√∞ √Åir. In 1937 the hunt went better and the two boats shot 43 whales each, while a decent catch, it wasn't enough to make things run smoothly. In 1938 P/F Sperm bought another boat Ribeira and the following years the hunt was about 100 whales pr boat, but the onset of World War II stopped all whaling activity. And the company had to sell the boat Falkur to repay loans. During the second World War, all whaling activity stopped, only to resume in 1945. P/F Sperm continued after the war, but whale stocks had by now diminished so much that it was hard to make the economy work. The company went bankrupt in 1952. And the bank Sj√≥vinnubankin took over ownership of the station. The company Heykur rented the station in the period 1952-1954 after which the company Partafelagi√∞ Hvalarakstur rented it until 1958. The station stopped producing whale oil with export in mind in 1958. During 1959-1961 no activity was at the station and some boats were sold. 1962 the company Treyst rented the station and the whaling boat Sumba, Sumba lay still for a large part of the time due to repairs. But it was still managed to produce 300 tonnes of whale meat in the period 1962-1966. Treyst tried again in the season 1968 with a new boat Heykur, but now it was a reality that there were too few whales left to run commercial whaling in the old way. In 1979 the boat Hv√≠tiklettur got permission to shoot occasional fin whales, to start with they were only allowed to shoot one in every ten sighted, and the catch in 1979 was 11 fin whales. Later they were only allowed to shoot three whales annually and the last years only one, the last fin whale was shot in 1986. A total of 4.454 whales came in at the station in the period 1906-1984 3.155 Fin whales, 524 Sperm whales, 509 Sei whales, 124 Minke whales, 62 Blue whales, 30 humpback whales and 410 unlisted whales. The last activity at the station was 26 November 2013, when a stranded Sperm Whale was hauled up and then subsequently exploded after being cut into, the incident was filmed and quickly went viral on the internet In 1989, the National Museum, determined that the station had historical importance and the same year it was decided to preserve the station. The following years a single caretaker was assigned to make emergency maintenance work on the buildings. In 1997 an assessment was made regarding how the preservation work should go ahead, without anything really being done on location. In 2008, a group of people were chosen by the Faroese government to deliver a \\"Provisional report on the conservation of the whaling station as a maritime museum\\", which is available in English too. In the autumn 2011 the station was opened for the public, and some 500 people visited the station. Preservation work and construction of the museum remains to be completed.  School  There is a school at Vi√∞ √Åir. The school is called Dugni; it is for young people and adults who have a disability, have psychological or sociological problems. They can get a shorter education there, 9th or 10th degree from the public school or the Danish education which is called HFS, which prepares them for an education in the service industry or working in an office.

It is an herb useful in Ayurvedic medicine used as an analeptic, antispasmodic, carminative, sedative, stimulant, stomachic, and nervine.Mathela, Chandra S, Tiwari, Mamta, Sammal, Subhash S, Chanotiya, Chandan S \\"Valeriana wallichii DC, a New Chemotype from Northwestern Himalaya\\" Journal of Essential Oil Research, Nov- Dec 2005 It grows in the Northwest Himalayas in places like Astore (Northern Pakistan) and forests in the region. The genus Valeriana, with about 200 species, belongs to the family Valerianaceae and has a distribution throughout the world. The Indian Valerian has long been used in Ayurveda (Charak Samhita and Susruta) and Unani systems of medicine, which describe its use in obesity, skin disease, insanity, epilepsy and snake poisoning. The crude drugs from roots/ rhizomes and Valerian derived phytomedicines are used as mild sedatives in pharmaceutical industry. The activity is largely attributed to the presence of valepotriates. General distribution Valeriana wallichii, the major species of the genus Valeriana, is native to India, Nepal and China. As an important substitute for the European V. officinalis, it has been traditionally used in treatment of sleep problems, obesity, nervous disorders and snake poisoning and skin diseases. Uttarakhand, part of Indian North western Himalaya, represents a mountainous region that encompasses agroclimatic conditions ranging from tropical to alpine and, thus, possesses a rich biodiversity. Valeriana, the major genus in the family Valerianaceae, is characterized by perennials that have three stamens without spurs on the slightly swollen base of the corolla, with a short and often strong-smelling root stalk. Strachey reported in 1918 the occurrence of five Valeriana species, V. dioica L., V. pyrolaefolia, V. stracheyi, V. wallichii DC., and V. hardwickii, at elevations ranging from 1500 ¬± 4300 m. A re-investigation of the morphology, distribution, and biodiversity of the Indian Valerianaceae, however, showed a total of 16 species/subspecies, of which six, namely V. wallichii DC. (V. jatamansi), V. himalayana (V. dioica L.), V. pyrolaefolia, V. mussooriensis, V. hardwickii. var. hardwickii, and V. hardwickii. var. arnottiana (Wt. C.B.) occur in Uttarakhand, Himalaya.

For the ten years following his abandoning his house, he is left with no one but his faithful Guenhwyvar, a magical Panther he had acquired in Homeland. He is also met with great dangers that he meets with the business ends of his scimitars. Struggling with conflicting emotions, which involve his failure in Menzoberranzan and a deep grief for his father Zaknafien, he makes his way to the surface to face newer dangers. Plot summary Drizzt spent some years in the Underdark, during which he was enslaved by mind flayers and then had to fight Zaknafein again, who had been made undead by Malice, thanks to Lolth's \\"greatest gift\\" Zin-Carla, to find Drizzt. In the end, Zaknafein regained enough control to sacrifice himself, flinging his body into a pool of acid. For Malice's failure to use Zaknafein to kill Drizzt, Lolth decreed that house Do'Urden should be destroyed, and House Baenre, the most favored First House of Menzoberranzan, did just that, with only Vierna and Dinin surviving.

() is a waterbody on the Baltic Sea coast northeast of Rostock in Germany. It consists of a string of several lagoons or bodden arranged in an east-west direction that are separated from the open sea by the Fischland- Dar√ü-Zingst peninsula. The surface area of these lagoons is 197 km¬≤ and the average water depth is only about two metres. The individual lagoons of the Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain are the: * Saaler Bodden * Bodstedter Bodden * Barther Bodden and * Grabow (listed from west to east; not mentioned here are several smaller stretches of interlinking water). The salt content of the water rises from west to east, because only at the eastern end of the bodden chain is there a link to the Baltic Sea via the Gellenstrom stream and the small opening between Gro√üer Werder and Kleiner Werder, where the waters are able to mix. There used to be other links to the sea like the Prerowstrom stream to the north (dammed after 1872) and the Permin and Loop by Fischland to the west (dammed in the 14th century). The rivers Recknitz and Barthe discharge into the Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain and, in all, it has catchment area of 1,578 km¬≤. On the south shore of the bodden chain lie the towns of Ribnitz-Damgarten and Barth. The northern part of the Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain belongs to the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park.

A number of rare and scarce plant species can be found on the site, along with many breeding seabirds. Geography The site, notified in 1951, is situated along the north Cornwall coast of the Celtic Sea in the Atlantic Ocean. It starts at Godrevy Head (with the Godrevy Towans) in the west and continues for to the north east, through Portreath, Porthtowan and ends just past St Agnes Head, north of the village of St Agnes.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End The South West Coast Path runs through the SSSI and part of the coastline is owned by the National Trust. Large sections of this site lie within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Coastline of the SSSI Geology The SSSI is predominantly situated on Devonian sandstones and shales, with the area around St Agnes formed from Grampound grit. Wildlife and ecology The site provides a variety of different habitats, including cliffs, maritime grassland, maritime heathland, sand dunes and scrubland which are host to numerous plant species and seabird colonies. For its flora the site is also designated a Special Area of Conservation. Flora The whole of this SSSI, as well as Cligga Head SSSI, has been designated as Godrevy Head to Cligga Point Important Plant Area, by the environmental organisation Plantlife, for it flora. The nationally rare species of shore dock (Rumex rupestris) and wild asparagus (Asparagus officinalis) can be found in the maritime grassland habitats, along with the also nationally rare carrot-broomrape (Orobanche maritima), a parasite of wild carrot (Daucus carota). Amongst the common plant species of the maritime heathland the nationally rare Cornish eyebright (Euphrasia vigursii), Dorset heath (Erica ciliaris) and hairy greenweed (Genista pilosa) can be found as well as the generally rare pale dog-violet (Viola lactea). The sand dunes, found around the east of the site at the Godrevy Towans, supports the nationally rare slender bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus angustissimus). Within the calcareous grassland section of the dunes the rare Portland spurge (Euphorbia portlandica) can be found, as well as a large colony of spotted cat's-ear (Hypochaeris maculata), which are nationally rare. Fauna The site contains 25 species of butterfly and 15 dragonfly and damselfly species, which include the nationally scarce varieties of silver-studded blue (Plebejus argus) and blue-tailed damselfly (Ischnura pumilio). A Black-legged Kittiwake, found on the site, in flight Scarlet and gold star coral are present within the rocky intertidal shores, rare for the Cornish coast; with grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) having breeding sites within the inaccessible sea caves. The rest of the cliffs, along with the offshore islands, are an important breeding site for a variety of seabird species and are home to the largest Cornish breeding colony of black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), with 1000‚Äì5000 birds being recorded in the area.

Although the novel received mixed reviews, it was shortlisted for both a Man Booker Prize and a Whitbread Award in 2001. Plot Set in San Fernando Valley and Hungary in 1997, the story revolves around a late-stage cancer patient, Alice; her two markedly different sons, one a translator, the other a soap star; and a seemingly unconnected Hungarian playwright named L√°szl√≥ L√°z√°r. The plot centres on the family's troubles and the sons coming to terms with the fact that their mother will likely not see another birthday. Reception The novel was relatively well received, with critics praising Miller's eloquent prose and rich characters, and detractors criticising the novel's unresolved ending and simple plot. Alfred Hickling, writing for The Guardian, praised Miller's \\"piteous and poetic\\" evocation of the subject of Alice's cancer and stated: \\"Most fiction catalogues its characters' achievements; Miller lingers remorselessly on their failures. It's a bleak world, but one invested with a peculiar beauty.\\" In a review for the New York Times, author Margot Livesey praised Miller's disparate storytelling, stating \\"only a writer of verve and talent would be able to pull off the creation of such varied milieus, and happily, Miller is such a writer.\\" Livesey also praised the ending of the novel, stating that \\"although Miller's methods may lead to a certain diminution of emotional impact, the ending of his novel more than rewards the attentive reader.\\" The novel was well received by Publishers Weekly, with the reviewer praising Miller's \\"elegant, resonant prose\\" and \\"brilliant dexterity\\" with respect to his intertwined plot-lines, and stating that \\"this book breathes with compassion and honesty, and with the rare quality called hope\\". The novel received mixed reviews from the Daily Telegraph and the Seattle Times. For the Seattle Times, reviewer Scott Stolnack found the novel \\"richly imagined\\" and praised the novel's depth and the strength of the individual characters, but did not feel it was \\"of the caliber of his previous works\\", stating \\"while certain scenes are rendered beautifully and lucidly, nothing here compares to the startling vividness of his two earlier novels\\". These views were coupled in the Telegraph, with the reviewer praising Miller's \\"stylistic polish\\", \\"considerable flair for characterisation\\" and \\"superbly realised\\" three-dimensional characters. The reviewer, however, also found that the \\"narrative meanders\\" somewhat and states that the novel as a whole \\"does not quite cohere, but there is fine writing on every page\\". Reviewing for the New Statesman, Hugo Barnacle was more critical of the novel, finding the prose \\"self-consciously literary\\" and commenting that it \\"doesn't quite pay its way\\". Barnacle also found the story lacking, stating, \\"The plotting would never pass muster at a crime writers' convention. For some reason, posh-prose writers can be very slack on that score. Miller introduces a loaded gun and a deadly poison capsule on the feeblest of pretexts.\\" He ended his review with the opinion that \\"Miller will have to ditch a few pretensions if he wants to be good\\". The novel was also not well received by Darren Waters of the BBC. Waters found the plot to be \\"disappointingly straightforward\\", the language to be \\"terse, almost perfunctory\\" and the female characters to be \\"drawn with pencil\\". He further stated: \\"The book's themes have the transparency of oxygen, as the title suggests, but they never crystallize into anything remotely interesting.\\" References Category:2001 British novels Category:Novels by Andrew Miller Category:Novels set in California Category:Novels set in Hungary Category:San Fernando Valley Category:Sceptre (imprint) books ","title":"Oxygen (Miller novel)"},{"id":"33974781","text":"\\"Eli's Comin' \\" is a song written and recorded in 1967 by American singer- songwriter and pianist Laura Nyro.Kort, Michele (2002). \\"Eli's Comin'\\".

Giancoli (2000). [Physics for Scientists and Engineers with Modern Physics (3rd Edition)]. Prentice Hall. Damped sine waves are commonly seen in science and engineering, wherever a harmonic oscillator is losing energy faster than it is being supplied.  Definition  Sine waves describe many oscillating phenomena. When the wave is damped, each successive peak decreases as time goes on. A true sine wave starting at time = 0 begins at the origin (amplitude = 0). A cosine wave begins at its maximum value due to its phase difference from the sinewave. In practice a given waveform may be of intermediate phase, having both sine and cosine components. The term \\"damped sine wave\\" describes all such damped waveforms, whatever their initial phase value. The most common form of damping, and that usually assumed, is exponential damping, in which the outer envelope of the successive peaks is an exponential decay curve. Equations The general equation for an exponentially damped sinusoid may be represented as: :y(t) = A \\\\cdot e^{-\\\\lambda t} \\\\cdot (\\\\cos(\\\\omega t + \\\\phi) + \\\\sin(\\\\omega t + \\\\phi)) where: :y(t) is the instantaneous amplitude at time t :A is the initial amplitude of the envelope. :\\\\lambda is the decay constant, in the reciprocal of the time units of the X axis. :\\\\phi is the phase angle at some arbitrary point. :\\\\omega is the Angular frequency. which can be simplified to :y(t) = A \\\\cdot e^{-\\\\lambda t} \\\\cdot (\\\\cos(\\\\omega t + \\\\phi)) Where: :\\\\phi is the phase angle at t = 0. Other important parameters include: :Period \\\\tau, the time it takes for a single cycle, in units of time t. It is the reciprocal of frequency (see below), i.e. f^{-1}. :Frequency f. is the number of cycles per time unit, and is equal to \\\\omega /(2 \\\\pi) . It is the reciprocal of period, i.e. \\\\tau^{-1}. and is expressed in inverse time units t^{-1}. :Half-life is the time it takes for the exponential amplitude envelope to decrease by a factor of 2. It is equal to \\\\ln(2)/\\\\lambda which is approximately 0.693/\\\\lambda. :Wavelength of a travelling wave is the distance between adjacent peaks and varies according to the speed of the wave's travel.

It is the flagship library for all of the Montana State University System's campuses. In 1978, the library was named the Roland R. Renne Library to honor the sixth president of the university. The library supports the research and information needs of Montana's students, faculty, and the Montana Extension Service. History In January 1894, about seven months after Montana College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts was founded, the college began acquiring and housing a formal library collection for its students and faculty research use. For the first two years of the library's existence, students or instructors served part-time to provide library services. In 1896, Mabel Ruth Owens became the first full-time professional librarian to oversee the library's operations and collection development. In 1927, the library was moved to the second floor of Montana Hall. Library in 1904'Library in 1950 In 1949, the library, its collection and research services were moved to a newly constructed library facility. After the transfer of nearly 100,000 volumes from various locations around campus the library officially opened its doors on January 9, 1950. Shortly thereafter, the then University Librarian Lesley M. Heathcote described the new facility as \\"not especially inspiring to look at\\" and embarked on expanding both the library building and its collections. In August 1960, construction began on a new 125,000 square foot addition adjacent to the west side of the 1950 building. The basement and first floor of the new addition were opened on January 3, 1962 and the entire four-story new addition was completed for occupancy in November 1966. On October 14, 1978, the Montana State University library was officially named for Roland R. Renne, the university's sixth president. The Montana State University Renne Library Building is 112,000 square feet in size and has a seating capacity of 1,100 and a total staffing of 74 part-time and full-time employees. In 2002, a significant three-year remodeling and seismic bracing were completed. The remodel included providing additional individual and group student study space, adding a new coffee bar and installing MSU alumnus Rudy Autio's ceramic sculpture Kosmos. A remodeling in 2011 transformed the entire first floor into an Information Commons. The newly reconfigured first floor opened up the area and added: movable furniture, multiple computer stations, portable classroom equipment, module group study rooms, increased power supply access for mobile devices, an expanded Writing Center, and Library Commons Technical Support staff to assist students and faculty with technical expertise. The Commons was designed and implemented to meet the needs of academic research faculty and students in the collaborative 21st-century information technology environment. The library has over 100 computers, many scanners and printers for walk-in use, and flexible module setting, tables and configurable group-study work areas. Laptops, handhelds and digital cameras are available for student checkout and there are numerous power-stations available for recharging handheld devices. Included in the Library Commons along with the Brewed Awakening Coffee Bar and Writing Center, are Browse and Reading Areas of current issues of magazines, daily newspapers, new book acquisitions and two sections of recommended books, one by university faculty and the other by library staff. Montana State University (MSU) Library Website gives students, faculty and the Montana community online access to Ask A Librarian online chat, the library catalog, digital collections, reserves, interlibrary loan, student group-room reservations, and online retrieval of e-books and academic journals. Collections Montana State University Library's collections include: books, e-books, digital media, multimedia, government documents, special collections, university archives, microform, and electronic and print academic, literary, and scientific journals and magazines. Digital collections There are several types of digital collections at Montana State University Library. One type includes collections held within the library's Special Collections that have been digitized for both online patron access and archival purposes, such as the early 20th century photographs by Thomas Brook and early Montana Extension Service Bulletins. A second type of digital collection includes those that are unique born-digital and reformatted digitally scanned print research materials focused on a Montana State University's degree program such as the Department of Earth Sciences' Advanced Snow Science Degree in partnership with International Snow Science Workshop (ISSW), American Avalanche Association and Canadian Avalanche Center. A third type of digital collection includes those collections culminating from a partnership grant to develop and distribute online research materials to faculty, students and the regional public. Examples of academic scholarly partnerships include the Range Science Information System (RSIS), an academic scholarly partnership project between Montana State University Library, the University of Idaho, and the University of Wyoming, and the Indian Peoples of the Northern Great Plains Digital Collection, which was a partnership grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) with Little Big Horn College Library, MSU-Northern Library, MSU-Bozeman Library, MSU-Billings Library, and the Museum of the Rockies. The library is also home to the Acoustic Atlas, a browsable collection of habitat and species sounds from throughout the Western United States. The Acoustic Atlas features the Yellowstone Collection, a curated compilation of field recordings as well as a podcast series highlighting America's first national park. The growing audio collection aims to create new ways to experience the animals, landscapes and people of the area, by offering a freely accessible online archive of natural sounds, interviews and radio stories focused on the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. ScholarWorks ScholarWorks is an open access institutional repository developed and maintained by the MSU Library for the collection, storage and online retrieval of Montana State University's intellectual work and scholarly output focused on Montana State University's mission of teaching, original research and community education initiatives.

Members of the authority are the cities of Flint and Lapeer, and the counties of Genesee, Lapeer and Sanilac. Karegnondi is a word from the Petan Indian language meaning \\"lake\\" and another early name for Lake Huron. Background Flint built its first water treatment plant (now defunct) in 1917. The city built a second plant in 1952. At the time of Flint's population peak and economic height (when the city was the center of the automobile industry), Flint's plants pumped 100 million gallons () of water per day. With the decline of the city's industry and a significant drop in the city's population (from almost 200,000 in 1960 to about 99,000 today), Flint pumped less water. By October 2015, when the Flint plant ended full time operations again, it pumped just 16 million gallons () daily. In 1963, Flint moved to build a pipeline from Lake Huron to Flint, but a profiteering scandal derailed that pipeline. This led the city to sign a contract to purchase water for 30 years from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department on June 6, 1964. For years, the City of Flint purchased Lake Huron water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (Detroit Water) under a now expired 30-year contract. Flint resold the water to the Genesee County Drain Commissioner who then sold it to municipalities in the county. Genesee County officials had disliked the high cost and usually high percentage increases of the Detroit Water, as the Department's formula penalized the area for its elevation and distance from Detroit. Detroit Water avoided direct rate discussions with Genesee County, working only with the city of Flint. Sanilac County has never previously had a public water system depending on individual wells instead. The City of Lapeer has been a member of the Greater Lapeer County Utilities Authority (GLCUA) which purchases water from Detroit Water. Future members that are clients of Detroit Water (Flint City, Genesee County and GLCUA) use 10% of the water but pay 21% of the costs. For years there has been talk among Genesee County officials about building a Lake Huron pipeline. The plan would build a pipeline from a 230-acre site located on the Sanilac-St. Clair County border. In 2006, the Genesee County Drain Commission had a feasibility study done which reawakened talk of a new pipeline. While estimated costs of the pipeline is around $600 million, County officials indicated that an authority-owned pipeline would cost less than continued purchasing Detroit water in the long- term. In 2002, Genesee County had purchased \\"326 acres of scenic woods, grassy meadows and 300 feet of lake frontage\\" from Detroit Edison in an auction for $2.7 million. Karegnondi Regional Water Planning Group In May 2007, Genesee County Drain Commissioner and Oakland County Drain Commissioner chose the name Karegnondi Regional Water Planning Group, the forerunner planning group for the Authority. Environmental groups, such as the Michigan Environmental Council and the Flint River Watershed Coalition, indicated in May 2009 that they did not have any issue with the Lake Huron pipeline plan as long as Genesee County Drain Commission files for the needed permits. In June, Cheboygan County Drain Commissioner Dennis G. Lennox II indicated that he might file a lawsuit to revoke a permit to use Lake Huron water if approved by Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, believing that Lake Huron's future would be jeopardized. In August 2009, a permit was issued in compliance with the 2008 Great Lakes Compact by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality for the withdrawal of 85 million gallons per day of water as a public water supply for Genesee County, the City of Flint and other potential customers: the Counties of Lapeer and Sanilac and City of Lapeer. Lennox filed an appeal of the issuance of the permit before the State Office of Administrative Hearings and Rules while in October Cheboygan County Board of Commissioners indicated that they were not supporting Lennox's appeal. On August 17, the Lapeer City Commission unanimously voted to be active in the Karegnondi Planning Group. Lapeer City's estimated share of the cost of $100 million would include a water treatment plant. In late October 2009, representatives for possible authority members met to decide under which state law to form the authority. On November 5, a meeting was held regarding the associated project. In March 2010, former pipeline supporter and former Genesee County Drain Commissioner Ken Hardin came out against the project, based on the City of Flint's poor financial condition. Instead, he recommended that the county seek a seat on a regional water board with Detroit. A request for bids was issued by the county for testing the Lake Huron pumping station's soil. On March 2, 2010, Lennox filed to withdraw his appeal of the issuance of the water permit to KWA due to limited funds. Lapeer City Commission approved the articles of incorporation in early April. On April 13, the Genesee County Board of Commissioners unanimously approved the articles of incorporation. The Lapeer County Board of Commissioners voted to join the authority on April 24 followed by the Lapeer City Commission and Flint City Council on April 26. History On October 26, 2010, the Karegnondi Water Authority Board of Trustees met for the first time with representatives from the incorporating Cities of Flint (Mayor Dayne Walling), Lapeer (City Manager Dale Kerbyson), and County Drain Commissioners of Genesee (Jeff Wright), Lapeer (John Cosens) and Sanilac (Gregory L. Alexander). Walling was elected chair. While Genesee County Drain Commissioner Wright was selected as the Agency's CEO and replaced on the Board by Genesee County Board of Commissioner Chair Jamie Curtis as Genesee County's representative, Alexander was chosen as vice chair, Flint City Council President Delrico Loyd was chosen as Treasurer and Amy Planck of Lapeer County for secretary. Ten additional Trustees were to be appointed based on expected water usage. In May 2011, DTE Energy indicated an interest in buying three million gallons of untreated lake water daily for its Greenwood electrical plant. St. Clair County also indicated that it was considering joining the Authority, while Flint was still considering whether or not to sign on to getting KWA water with Mayor Dayne Walling supporting the move. In June, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department negotiated with the KWA. The expected online date of the new pipeline was 2015. On September 7, Rowe Engineering reported to the Flint City Council that the most expensive option was to continue with Detroit Water with the next expensive option was upgrading the City's Flint River plant for 24-hour 7-day-a-week operations and the least expensive option was the KWA Lake Huron pipeline. With Flint placed under the control of an Emergency Manager in December, the authority wanted a decision by year's end on whether the city would continue with the pipeline. In May 2012, Genesee County moved to sell 40 acres of the Lake Huron property that the county purchased in 2002 and was expecting to get $350,000 for the land. The 40 acres was sold to the Genesee County Drain Commission in January 2013 for $346,000. On January 11, 2013, the Authority received the final permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to build the Karegnondi pipeline. In February, L. D'Agostini & Sons was the low bidder ($24.6 million, which is less than the engineers' estimated $27 million) to build the massive intake into Lake Huron. On April 12, Oakland County Water Resources Commissioner Jim Nash and County Executive L. Brooks Patterson came out against the KWA water pipeline because of the increased cost burden on remaining customers of the Detroit Water system. L. D'Agostini & Sons again was awarded a contract for the pump station with a bid of $11.05 million (a saving of $2.75 million below estimates). On March 25, 2013, the Flint City Council approved 7‚Äì1 to purchase 16 million gallons per day from the KWA, the lone no vote going with Flint River water as a permanent supply. Flint emergency manager Ed Kurtz and Mayor Dayne Walling approved the action on March 29 and forwarded the action for the State Treasurer to approve. The Detroit Water and Sewer Department (DWSD) sent out a press release demanding that the state should block Flint's request, as it would hurt Detroit Water, and start a \\"water war\\". The release also outlined 4 options for Flint including the sale of raw untreated water. Genesee County Drain Commissioner Wright replied that: \\"It would be unprecedented for the state to force one community to enter into an agreement with another, simply to artificially help one community at the other's expense. This is exactly what the (Detroit Water and Sewerage Department) is arguing should be done. If the DWSD was serious they would contact the appropriate officials instead of negotiating through the media.\\" On April 15, State Treasurer Andy Dillon gave approval to Kurtz to enter into a water purchase contract with the KWA. EM Kurtz signed the KWA water purchase agreement on April 16. On April 17, the Detroit Water and Sewer Department gave its one year termination notice to the city just days after the County and City rejected the DWSD' last offer. The DWSD expected Flint to pay them for \\"'stranded costs,' or past investments in the water system that have benefited customers in this area.\\" Flint and Genesee rejected such responsibility, although they would be willing to purchase some pipeline. Governor Rick Snyder called a meeting of the three parties for April 19. Construction On Friday, June 28, 2013, a ground breaking ceremony for the pipeline project took place at the authority's Lake Huron property. The authority entered final negotiations in September 2013 on an agreement for American Cast Iron Pipe Company to supply 67 miles of spiral weld and iron pipe, additional fittings, bends, reducers and hydrant tees with the final cost expected to be $84.1 million while the estimated cost was $104 million. Two other bids were received from Northwest Pipe ($81.2 million) and Hansen Pipe ($101.8 million). An August 1 Genesee County $53 million Bond sale was postponed due to the City of Detroit filing for bankruptcy. The county sold $35 million in bonds in September that were delayed from August. On October 16, 2013, ten additional trustees were added to the board of trustees: former state House Minority Leader Richard Hammel; Johsua Freeman, Flint City Council; Larry Green, Mt. Morris Township supervisor; Ted Henry, Genesee County commissioner; Micki Hoffman, Grand Blanc Township supervisor; Steve Landaal, president of Landaal Packaging; Sheldon Neeley, Flint City Council; Thomas Svcek, Swartz Creek Department of Public Works director; Tracey Tucker, Flint Township building administrator; and Paula Zelenko, mayor of Burton. In November 2013, American Cast Iron Pipe Company became the first to build a production facility in Flint's former Buick City site purchasing the property from the RACER Trust.(November 13, 2013). Pipe maker to add 60 jobs at Flint's Buick City property Detroit Free Press. In early December 2013, a German-made micro-tunnel boring machine was scheduled to begin the horizontally drilling out 60 feet below Lake Huron and would take 30 months to complete. In March 2014, the KWA put out to market $220 million in bonds with excellent ratings from the credit rating agencies putting interest rates to about 5% or lower. The City of Flint began its temporary use of Flint River water as its primary source of drinking water on April 25, 2014 while Genesee County continued to purchase from Detroit water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Karegnondi Water Authority began discussion in April regarding how to proceed with protected endangered Northern riffleshell in the Black River in Sanilac County which might force the authority to move from an open-cut to the more expensive boring under the river. In May 2014, the Imlay City area intermediate pump station construction was awarded to E&L; Construction Group at a bid price of $11.78 million, $6.82 million less than the estimated $18.6 million. In June, Zito Construction Company, of Grand Blanc, Michigan, won a pipeline contract for installing iron transmission main along the line. Flint emergency manager Darnell Earley finalized the sale of an Eastern Genesee County 9-mile section of water pipeline to Genesee County for $3.9 million. This pipeline feeds Detroit water to the county and after the Huron pipeline is active would service the Eastern part of the county. Meanwhile, the City of Flint was having problems with its water system, rising to a crisis; having to issue boil water notices, issue warning notices for a year over a one time spike in TTMs, and culminating with findings of lead contamination. Flint's reconnection to the Great Lakes Water Authority (formerly called Detroit Water) system was announced on October 8, 2015. The KWA board met on November 25, 2015 to elect new leadership. Newly elected Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, Flint City Councilman Eric Mays and Laura Sullivan became new board members at that meeting. With Flint Mayor Walling losing his election, Mayor Weaver nominated herself as chair due to Walling previously holding the position. Instead, current vice chair & Sanilac Drain Commissioner Alexander was selected chair with Genesee County Commission chair Curtis was selected as vice chair. Operational Connections to the new KWA water source were anticipated to happen sometime in 2017. Beginning in July, water was being transported by the KWA pipeline from Lake Huron to the Genesee County treatment plant. Genesee County had been testing its treated water since August 2017. A 30-year contract with the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) on November 21, 2017 was approved by Flint City Council members voting 5-4. On Monday November 27, 2017, the northern loop set of municipalities began receiving water from the KWA pipeline and treated by Genesee County Drain Commission Water and Waste Division. The northern group consisted of cities of Clio, Flushing, Montrose and Mt. Morris and townships of Davison, Flushing, Genesee, Montrose, Richfield, Thetford and Vienna. The southern group started receiving water from the KWA and Genesee Water on December 15, 2017. The southern group consists of the cities of Burton and Swartz Creek and the townships of Clayton, Flint, Gaines, Mundy and Grand Blanc.

The project aims to serve as a model for other medical institutions interested in helping wounded service members. The project was developed by Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center board member and philanthropist Ronald A. Katz, who was moved to develop Operation Mend after he saw a story about U.S. Marine Aaron Mankin who experienced disfiguring injuries after a road-side bomb ripped through their vehicle on a convoy in Iraq. Mankin would later be Operation Mend‚Äôs first patient. As of 2011, 53 military patients from various military branches had surgeries led by Timothy A. Miller, M.D., Chief of the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at UCLA, who is also a military veteran. Operation Mend procedures include: plastic surgery, orthopaedic reconstruction, urology and otolaryngology to reconstruct severely damaged limbs, radiation oncology, dermatology, neurology, ophthalmology and medical tattooing. Additionally, the project has included the Maxillofacial/Dentistry Department at UCLA, where several patients have had new prosthetic ears designed for them. Operation Mend patients also have access to the UCLA Brain Injury Research Center, which includes access to the program's mental wellness program, which incorporates neurologic, neuropsychiatric, and psychiatric evaluations and treatment plans. Philanthropic support Operation Mend relies on philanthropic donations from business members, community and public donors to care for military patients. It is approximately $500,000 for a wounded warrior to receive a patient evaluation, plastic and reconstructive surgeries, transportation, housing for multiple treatments and other services needed to provide care. With the help of philanthropic support, Operation Mend has been able to fund over 190 surgeries, schedule 863 appointments, provide 3,876 days of lodging at UCLA‚ÄôS Tiverton House and provide over 1,000 flight accommodations for patients and their family members. Notable donations In October 2011, General Motors donated a 2011 Chevrolet Camaro convertible that was custom designed by the auto restyling business West Coast Customs. The Camaro had a customized camouflage paint design that represents all branches of the U.S. military. The car was auctioned live at the Mecum Auto Auction in Dallas, Texas. The winning bid of $333,000 was made by Ben Mecum on behalf of the Mecum family and the entire Mecum organization. Auction participants Tom Abrams of Reliable Carriers and Ray Claridge of Cinema Vehicle Services each added a $10,000 donation. Reliable Carriers also donated complimentary transport of the vehicle to and from the event. Donations from other buyers, sellers and spectators in the crowd raised an additional $13,000; bringing the total donation from the event to $366,000. The Operation Mend Camaro served as the grand marshal car in New York City's Veterans Day Parade on Nov. 11, 2011. Operation Mend founder Ronald A. Katz, Operation Mend patient Captain James \\"Jae\\" Barclay and Camaro owner Ben Mecum all served as special grand marshals for the New York City Veteran‚Äôs Day Parade on Nov. 11. In April 2011, the aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin donated $4 million to the Operation Mend Project. The donation allowed additional patients to have various surgical procedures and support the renovation of the surgical waiting room and the pre- and post-operative recovery areas at UCLA. The renovation included adding four private patient recovery suites, four new surgical suites and a telemedicine video conference center for patients and their families. In July 2010, DRS Technologies, Inc., a supplier of integrated products, services and support to military forces, intelligence agencies and prime contractors, raised over $1,000,000 through employee donations to support Operation Mend. As of 2011, DRS Technologies had donated over $1,080,000 to Operation Mend.

For example, it can be consumed as food or as a dessert It is a cultural food and is an OTOP product . Moreover, Thai people present khao lam to monks to make merit. Furthermore, it is gradually becoming a Thai tradition. In the past, Thailand had an uncountable number of bamboo trees. Thai people thought about the utility of using bamboo for cooking purposes. The ingredients of khao lam are glutinous rice, black beans, coconut milk, sugar and salt. Moreover, taro or young coconut may be added for a more appetizing taste. To make khao lam, the first step is to cut a piece of bamboo with one knot intact at one end and the other end exposed. Then, clean the outside surface of the bamboo and dry it. The second step is to clean the rice with water until the water turns clear. Then, dry and mix the rice with the black beans.The third step is to mix coconut milk, sugar and salt. The fourth step is pouring the rice prepared in the second step into about two-thired of the bamboo sections, then pour the coconut mixture on top of the rice. The fifth step is to arrange the sections into rows and put a layer of a trunk of a banana tree to cover the side of the section rows. The final step is to roast it the bamboo sections for about 30 - 45 minutes until the sections turn yellow. Then, serve it. Nowadays, khao lam is not only food or to give to the monks but also has become the product that produce so many benefits and careers for Thai people.

Design and development Ordered by the Polish Ministry of Transport as a fast mail-plane, the prototype flew for the first time in September 1933 and was the first P.Z.L. aircraft with a retractable undercarriage. Several tests made at the Institute of Aviation in 1935-1936 showed that the plane had poor performance and was uneconomical to operate. Technical design Construction of the P.Z.L. 27 consisted of a welded steel tube fuselage and tail-unit covered with fabric and a wooden 2-spar wing. Three de Havilland Gipsy Major I engines were fitted, one in the nose and two in strut-mounted nacelles under the high-set wings. The retractable main undercarriage members retracted manually into the rear of the engine nacelles, with a non-retractable tail-skid at the extreme rear of the fuselage. Operational history After initial flight testing the prototype P.Z.L. 27 the aircraft was returned to P.Z.L. to have a revised wing fitted to alleviate problems with insufficient stiffness and poor lateral stability. After a second phase of testing a Certificate of Airworthiness was issued and the aircraft was equipped for use as an airliner, being delivered to P.L.L. (LOT). LOT used the aircraft for proving flights on mail routes but regarded it as obsolete, refusing to order production aircraft. The RWD 11, designed in competition with the P.Z.L. 27, was regarded as superior but this aircraft also failed to attract production orders. After accumulating 70 hours flying with LOT, the P.Z.L. 27 was bought by the Polish Air Force for the I.T.L. (Instytut Techniczny Lotnictwa - Technical Aviation Institute).

The Syrian opposition evolved since the beginning of the Syrian conflict from groups calling for the overthrow of the Assad government in Syria and who have opposed its Ba'athist government. Prior to the Syrian Civil War, the term \\"opposition\\" () had been used to refer to traditional political actors, for example the National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change; that is, groups and individuals who have had a history of dissidence against the Syrian state. The first opposition structures to form in the Syrian uprising were local protest-organizing committees. These formed in April 2011, as protesters graduated from spontaneous protests to protests organized by meetings beforehand. The Syrian uprising phase, from March 2011 until the start of August 2011, was characterized by a consensus for nonviolent struggle among the uprising's participants. Thus the conflict could not have been yet characterized as a \\"civil war\\", until army units defected in response to government reprisals against the protest movement.This occurred 2012, allowing the conflict to meet the definition of \\"civil war.\\" Opposition groups in Syria took a new turn in late 2011, during the Syrian Civil War, as they united to form the Syrian National Council (SNC), which has received significant international support and recognition as a partner for dialogue. The Syrian National Council was recognized or supported in some capacity by at least 17 member states of the United Nations, with three of those (France, United Kingdom and the United States) being permanent members of the Security Council. A broader opposition umbrella group, the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, was formed in November 2012 and has gained recognition as the \\"legitimate representative of the Syrian people\\" by the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (CCASG) and as a \\"representative of aspirations of Syrian people\\" by the Arab League. The Syrian National Coalition was subsequently considered to take the seat of Syria in the Arab League, with the Syrian government representative suspended that year. The Syrian National Council, initially a part of the Syrian National Coalition, withdrew on 20 January 2014 in protest at the decision of the coalition to attend the Geneva talks. Despite tensions, the Syrian National Council retained a degree of ties with the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces. Syrian opposition groups held reconciliation talks in Astana, Kazakhstan in October 2015. In late 2015, the Syrian Interim Government relocated its headquarters to the Turkish-occupied areas in North Syria and began to execute some authority in the area. In 2017, the opposition government in the Idlib Governorate was challenged by the rival Syrian Salvation Government, backed by the Islamist faction Hayat Tahrir al- Sham (HTS). A July 2015 ORB International poll of 1,365 adults across all of Syria's 14 governorates found that about 26 percent of the population supported the Syrian opposition (41 percent in the areas it controlled), compared to 47 percent who supported the Syrian Arab Republic's government (73 percent in the areas it controlled), 35 percent who supported the Al-Nusra Front (58 percent in the areas it controlled), and 22 percent who supported the Islamic State (71 percent in the areas it controlled).\\"ORB/IIACSS POLL IN IRAQ AND SYRIA GIVES RARE INSIGHT INTO PUBLIC OPINION.\\" ORB International July 2015. PDF link (see tables 1 and 8). A March 2018 ORB International Poll with a similar method and sample size found that support had changed to 40% Syrian government, 40% Syrian opposition (in general), 15% Syrian Democratic Forces, 10% al-Nusra Front, and 4% Islamic State (crossover may exist between supporters of factions). NEW ORB POLL: 52% SYRIANS BELIEVE ASSAD REGIME WILL WIN THE WAR . ORB International. 15 March 2015. Background Syria has been an independent republic since 1946 after the expulsion of the French forces. For decades, the country was partially stable with a series of coups until the Ba'ath Party seized power in Syria in 1963 after a coup d'√©tat. The head of state since 1971 has been a member of the al-Assad family, beginning with Hafez al-Assad (19712000). Syria was under emergency law from the time of the 1963 Syrian coup d'√©tat until 21 April 2011, when it was rescinded by Bashar al-Assad, Hafez's eldest surviving son and the current President of Syria.Syria's state of emergency , Al Jazeera, 17 April 2011. As the revolutionary wave commonly referred to as the Arab Spring began to take shape in early 2011, Syrian protesters began consolidating opposition councils. History The Istanbul Meeting for Syria, the first convention of the Syrian opposition, took place on 26 April 2011, during the Syrian civil uprising. There followed the Antalya Conference for Change in Syria or Antalya Opposition Conference, a three-day conference of representatives of the Syrian opposition held from 31 May until 3 June 2011 in Antalya, Turkey. Organized by Ammar al-Qurabi's National Organization for Human Rights in Syria and financed by the wealthy Damascene Sanqar family, it led to a final statement refusing compromise or reform solutions, and to the election of a 31-member leadership. After the Antalya conference, a follow-up meeting took place two days later in Brussels, then another gathering in Paris that was addressed by Bernard Henri Levy. It took a number of further meetings in Istanbul and Doha before yet another meeting on 23 August 2011 in Istanbul set up a permanent transitional council in form of the Syrian National Council. Political groups The Syrian opposition does not have a definitive political structure. In December 2015, members of the Syrian opposition convened in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: 34 groups attended the convention, which aimed to produce a unified delegation for negotiations with the Syrian government. Notable groups present included: * the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, which supported the implementation of the 2012 Geneva Communique, which calls for the establishment of a transitional governing body in Syria * the National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change, which called for negotiations on a peaceful transition * armed groups: ** Jaysh al-Islam ** Ahrar al-Sham ** the Southern Front The December 2015 convention notably did not include: * the Kurdish PYD party and its affiliates * Salafist armed groups such as Al-Nusra Front. National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces upright The National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces is a coalition of opposition groups and individuals, mostly exilic, who support the Syrian revolution side and oppose the Assad government ruling Syria. It formed on 11 November 2012 at a conference of opposition groups and individuals held in Doha, Qatar. It has relations with other opposition organizations such as the Syrian National Council, the previous iteration of an exilic political body attempting to represent the grassroots movement; the union of the two was planned, but has failed to realize. Moderate Islamic preacher Moaz al-Khatib, who had protested on the Syrian street in the early nonviolent phase of the uprising, served a term as the president of the coalition, but soon resigned his post, frustrated with the gap between the body and the grassroots of the uprising inside Syria. Riad Seif and Suheir Atassi, both of whom had also protested on the street in Syria early in the uprising, were elected as vice presidents. Mustafa Sabbagh is the coalition's secretary-general. Notable members of the Coalition include: * the Assyrian Democratic Organization: a party representing Assyrians in Syria and long repressed by the Assad government, it has participated in opposition structures since the beginning of the conflict. Abdul-Ahad Astepho is a member of the SNC. Syrian National Council The Syrian National Council (al- Majlis al-Wa·π≠anƒ´ as-S≈´ri) sometimes known as SNC, the Syrian National Transitional Council or the National Council of Syria, is a Syrian opposition coalition, based in Istanbul (Turkey), formed in August 2011 during the Syrian civil uprising against the government of Bashar al-Assad. Initially, the council denied seeking to play the role of a government in exile, but this changed a few months later when violence in Syria intensified. The Syrian National Council seeks the end of Bashar al-Assad's rule and the establishment of a modern, civil, democratic state. The SNC National Charter lists human rights, judicial independence, press freedom, democracy and political pluralism as its guiding principles. In November 2012 the Council agreed to unite with several other opposition groups to form the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, with the SNC having 22 out of 60 seats. The Council withdrew from the Coalition on 20 January 2014 in protest at the decision of the Coalition to attend talks in Geneva. Notable members of the Council include: * the Syrian Democratic People's Party, a socialist party which played a \\"key role\\" in forming the SNC. The Party's leader George Sabra (a secularist born into a Christian family) is the official spokesman of the SNC, and also ran for chairman. * the Supreme Council of the Syrian Revolution, a Syrian opposition group supporting the overthrow of Bashar al- Assad's government. It grants local opposition groups representation in its national organization. * the Syrian Democratic Turkmen Movement: An opposition party, constituted in Istanbul on 21 March 2012, of Syrian Turkmens. Ziyad Hasan leads the Syrian Democratic Turkmen Movement. National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change The National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change (NCC), or National Coordination Body for Democratic Change (NCB), is a Syrian bloc chaired by Hassan Abdel Azim and consisting of 13 left-wing political parties and \\"independent political and youth activists\\". Reuters has defined the committee as the internal opposition's main umbrella group. The NCC initially had several Kurdish political parties as members, but all except for the Democratic Union Party left in October 2011 to join the Kurdish National Council. Some opposition activists have accused the NCC of being a \\"front organization\\" for Bashar al-Assad's government and have denounced some of its members as ex-government insiders. The NCC generally has poor relationships with other Syrian political opposition groups. The Syrian Revolution General Commission, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, and the Supreme Council of the Syrian Revolution oppose the NCC calls to dialogue with the Syrian government. In September 2012 the Syrian National Council (SNC) reaffirmed that despite broadening its membership, it would not join with \\"currents close to [the] NCC\\". Despite the NCC recognizing the Free Syrian Army (FSA) on 23 September 2012, the FSA has dismissed the NCC as an extension of the government, stating that \\"this opposition is just the other face of the same coin\\". Notable former members of the Committee have included: * the Syriac Union Party, a party representing the interests of Syriac Christians and affiliated with the Syriac Union Party in Lebanon (itself part of the anti-Assad March 14 Alliance). It has taken part in numerous opposition demonstrations, including storming the Syrian embassy in Stockholm in August 2012.http://suroyotv.com/en/images/files/The_Syriac_Union_Party_In_Syria_entered_the_syrian_embassy_in_Sweden.pdf It later left the NCC and joined the Syrian Democratic Council in late 2015. * the Democratic Union Party, the main Kurdish party in Syria and the dominant party in the de facto Democratic Federation of Northern Syria. It later left the NCC and joined the Syrian Democratic Council in late 2015. Syrian Democratic Council The Syrian Democratic Council was established on 10 December 2015 in al-Malikiyah. It was co-founded by prominent human rights activist Haytham Manna and was intended as the political wing of the Syrian Democratic Forces. The council includes more than a dozen blocs and coalitions that support federalism in Syria, including the Movement for a Democratic Society, the Kurdish National Alliance in Syria, the Law‚ÄìCitizenship‚ÄìRights Movement, and since September 2016 the Syria's Tomorrow Movement. The last group is led by former National Coalition president and Syrian National Council Ahmad Jarba. In August 2016 the SDC opened a public office in al- Hasakah. The Syrian Democratic Council is considered an \\"alternative opposition\\" bloc. Its leaders included former NCC members such as Riad Darar, a \\"key figure\\" in the Syrian opposition, and Haytham Manna, who resigned from the SDC in March 2016 in protest of its announcement of the Northern Syria Federation. The SDC was rejected by some other opposition groups due to its system of federalism. The Syrian Democratic Council was invited to participate in the international Geneva III peace talks on Syria in March 2016. However, it rejected the invitations because no representatives of the Movement for a Democratic Society, led by the Democratic Union Party, were invited. Other groups affiliated with Syrian opposition *Muslim Brotherhood: Islamist party founded in 1930. The brotherhood was behind the Islamic uprising in Syria between 1976 until 1982. The party is banned in Syria and membership became a capital offence in 1980. The Muslim Brotherhood has issued statements of support for the Syrian uprising. Other sources have described the group as having \\"risen from the ashes\\",Syria's Muslim Brotherhood rise from the ashes By Khaled Yacoub Oweis6 May 2012 \\"resurrected itself\\"Syria‚Äôs Muslim Brotherhood is gaining influence over anti-Assad revolt By Liz Sly, Washington Post 12 May 2012 to be a dominant force in the uprising. The Muslim Brotherhood has constantly lost influence with militants on the ground, who have defected from the Brotherhood affiliated Shields of the Revolution Council to the Islamic Front. *Coalition of Secular and Democratic Syrians: nucleus of a Syrian secular and democratic opposition that appeared during the Syrian civil war. It came about through the union of a dozen Muslim and Christian, Arab and Kurd parties, who called the minorities of Syria to support the fight against the government of Bashar al-Assad.John Irish (16 September 2011) \\"France hails Syria council, develops contacts\\" , Reuters.\\"Les partis d'opposition la√Øcs syriens unissent leurs forces √† Paris\\" , Agence France-Presse, 18 September 2011.

Key people are activists Razan Zaitouneh and Suhair al- Atassi. * Syrian National Democratic Council: formed in Paris on 13 November 2011 during the Syrian civil war by Rifaat al-Assad, uncle of Bashar al-Assad. Rifaat al-Assad has expressed the wish to replace Bashar al-Assad with the authoritarian state apparatus intact, and to guarantee the safety of government members, while also making vague allusions to a \\"transition\\". Rifaat has his own political organisation, the United National Democratic Rally. * Syrian Revolution General Commission: Syrian coalition of 40 Syrian opposition groups to unite their efforts during the Syrian civil war that was announced on 19 August 2011 in Istanbul. * Hizb ut-Tahrir Governance Syrian Interim Government At a conference held in Istanbul on 19 March 2013 members of the National Coalition elected Ghassan Hitto as prime minister of an interim government for Syria, the Syrian Interim Government (SIG). Hitto has announced that a technical government will be formed which will be led by between 10 and 12 ministers, with the Free Syrian Army choosing the Minister of Defense. The SIG is based in Turkey. It has been the primary civilian authority throughout most of opposition-held Syria. Its system of administrative local councils operate services such as schools and hospitals in these areas, as well as the Free Aleppo University. By late 2017, it presided over 12 provincial councils and over 400 elected local councils. It also operates a major border crossing between Syria and Turkey, which generates an estimated $1 million revenue each month. It is internationally recognized by the European Union and the United States, among others. It maintains diplomatic ties with some non-FSA rebel groups, such as Ahrar al- Sham, but is in conflict with the more extreme Tahrir al-Sham, which is one of the largest armed groups in Idlib Governorate. Syrian Salvation Government Flag used by the Syrian Salvation Government The Syrian Salvation Government is an alternative government of the Syrian opposition seated within Idlib Governorate, which was formed by the General Syrian Conference in September 2017. The domestic group has appointed Mohammed al- Sheikh as head of the Government with 11 more ministers for Interior, Justice, Endowment, Higher Education, Education, Health, Agriculture, Economy, Social Affairs and Displaced, Housing and Reconstruction and Local Administration and Services. Al-Sheikh, in a press conference held at the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing has also announced the formation of four commissions: Inspection Authority, Prisoners and missing Affairs, Planning and Statistics Authority, and the Union of Trade Unions. The founder of the Free Syrian Army, Col. Riad al-Asaad, was appointed as deputy prime minister for military affairs. The SSG is associated with Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and not recognised by the rest of the opposition, which is in conflict with HTS. There is a sharp ideological divide between the two competing opposition civil authorities: The SIG espouses secular, moderate values and regularly participates in international peace talks; the SSG enforces a strict interpretation of Islamic law and stringently rejects talks with the Syrian regime. Territorial control Various Syrian opposition groups have at least some presence in seven Syrian governorates, though none is fully under the control of the entity. Governorates with partial opposition control include: Governorates under partial control of opposition groups aligned with the Syrian Interim Government: *Latakia Governorate - Control on Eastern areas next to Idlib. *Idlib Governorate - *Hama Governorate - Limited Control on Northern areas next to Idlib. *Aleppo Governorate *Hasakah Governorate *Raqqa Governorate Governorates under partial control of opposition groups aligned with the Syrian Democratic Council: *Hasakah Governorate *Raqqa Governorate *Aleppo Governorate *Deir ez-Zor Governorate Turkish-Controlled territories and territories controlled by the Syrian Interim Government In April 2015, after the Second Battle of Idlib, the interim seat of the Syrian Interim Government was proposed to be Idlib, in the Idlib Governorate. However, this move was rejected by the al-Nusra Front and Ahrar al-Sham-led Army of Conquest, which between them controlled Idlib. According to the Syrian National Coalition, in 2017 there were 404 opposition-aligned local councils operating in villages, towns, and cities controlled by rebel forces. In 2016, the Syrian Interim Government became established within the Turkish Controlled areas. Territories governed by the Salvation Government The Salvation Government extends authority mostly in the Idlib Governorate. Recognition and foreign relations The foreign relations of the Syrian Opposition refers to the external relations of the self-proclaimed oppositional Syrian Arab Republic, which sees itself as the genuine Syria. The region of control of Syrian opposition affiliated groups is not well defined. The Turkish government recognizes Syrian opposition as the genuine Syrian Arab Republic and hosts several of its institutions on its territory. The seat of Syria in the Arab League is reserved for the Syrian opposition since 2014, but not populated. The opposition as a whole is characterised as \\"terrorist\\" by Iran,https://ctc.usma.edu/irans-unwavering-support-to-assads-syria/ Russiahttps://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2015/11/10/world-powers- drawing-up-syrian-rebel-terrorist-red-list and Syria.https://www.refworld.org/docid/5bcf1f6dc.html Military forces Initially, the Free Syrian Army was perceived as the ultimate military force of the Syrian Opposition, but with the collapse of many FSA factions and emergence of powerful Islamist groups, it became clear to the opposition that only a cooperation of secular military forces and moderate Islamists could form a sufficient coalition to battle both the Syrian Government forces and radical Jihadists such as ISIL and in some cases al-Nusra Front. In 2014, the military forces associated with the Syrian Opposition were defined by the Syrian Revolutionary Command Council, which in turn was mainly relying on the Free Syrian Army (with links to Syrian National Coalition) and the Islamic Front (Syria). Members of the Syrian Revolutionary Command Council: *Free Syrian Army: Paramilitary that has been active during the Syrian civil war.

The leader of the group, who identified himself as Colonel Riad al- Asaad, announced that the Free Syrian Army would work with demonstrators to bring down the system, and declared that all security forces attacking civilians are justified targets. It has also been reported that many former Syrian Consulates are trying to band together a Free Syrian Navy from fishermen and defectors to secure the coast. **Syrian Turkmen Brigades: An armed opposition structure of Syrian Turkmens fighting against Syrian Armed Forces.

Fujita joined the American Boy Scouts upon moving to El Reno, and survived well under his father's healthy income during the Great Depression.Fujita, p. 10. It was at this time that he earned the nickname \\"Foo\\", based on a childhood pet.Fujita, p. 11.

He obtained work as a cartoonist for a local school newspaper and as a stage hand in various theatre plays.Fujita, p. 13-14. Enlistment Fujita became interested in joining the military after hearing of his friend's enjoyment of the Texas National Guard. He enlisted after a lengthy debate between the National Guard and the civics teacher of the local high school debating the legitimacy of his claim to American citizenship, as well as questions over his weight, height and age, all three of which were below the minimum level.Fujita, p. 13-15.

Battle of Java Japanese bicycle infantry moving through Java. =Japanese landings= During the Battle of the Java Sea on 27 February 1942, the Allied navies suffered a disastrous defeat at the hand of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDA) Strike Force commander‚ÄîAdmiral Karel Doorman‚Äîwas killed. What followed was several landings on the island of Java on March 1. The Allied forces were commanded by the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) commander, General Hein ter Poorten. Although the KNIL forces had, on paper, 25,000 (mostly Indonesian) well-armed troops, many were poorly trained. The Japanese troops landed at three points on Java on 1 March. The West Java invasion convoy landed on Bantam Bay near Merak and Eretan Wetan, having defeated HMAS Perth and USS Houston at the Battle of Sunda Strait, a few hours prior to landing. The East Java invasion convoy landed on Kragan. = Land campaign = Japanese troops, mainly from the 48th Division, landed at three points on Java on March 1. The Dutch and other Allied forces were organized in four sub-commands: Batavia (Jakarta); North Central Java; South Java and East Java. As the only US ground forces in Java, the main body of the 2nd Battalion, 131st Field Artillery was attached to an Australian Army formation named Blackforce after its commander, Brigadier Arthur Blackburn. The Australians lacked infantry units, but included a heavy machine gun battalion, a pioneer battalion, several smaller units, some reinforcements diverted en route to Singapore after the Allied surrender there, a handful of Australian soldiers who had escaped from Singapore, two transport companies, and a casualty clearing station. From these units, Blackburn organized three makeshift infantry battalions. However, \\"E\\" Battery, 2/131st Field Artillery, including Frank Fujita, were attached to Dutch infantry in Central and East Java. On March 2, at Leuwiliang, 15 miles (24 km) west of Buitenzorg, \\"D\\" Battery, 2/131st Field Artillery, supported the makeshift Australian infantry, positioned along a riverbank. The Allies put up a vigorous defence. Volleys from \\"D\\" Battery reportedly destroyed many Japanese tanks and trucks. Blackforce managed to hold up the Japanese advance for two full days before being forced to withdraw to Soekabumi, lest it become trapped by Japanese flanking manoeuvres, and was ordered to retreat to Soekabumi. The Japanese quickly overwhelmed the Allied defences in most other areas. However, at Porong, near Surabaya, the Texans of \\"E\\" Battery, including Frank Fujita, supported the Dutch 8th and 13th Infantry Battalions, as well as the Dutch 3rd Cavalry Unit, in giving fierce resistance to the incoming Japanese. = Allied surrender = By 7 March, defeat was inevitable, with Tjilatjap already in Japanese hands. Soerabaja was being evacuated while Japanese troops were rapidly converging on Bandoeng from both the north and the west. At 09:00 on 8 March, the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied forces ‚Äî Ter Poorten ‚Äî announced the surrender of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army in Java. At 23:00, the Dutch radio station NIROM (Nederlandsch Indische Radio Omroep Maatschappij) broadcast the last news from a temporary transmitter at Ciumbuleuit. The announcer Bert Garthoff ended the broadcast with the words \\"Wij sluiten nu. Vaarwel tot betere tijden. Leve de Koningin!\\" (We are closing now. Farewell till better times. Long live the Queen!) The Dutch Governor, Jonkheer Dr. A.W.L. Tjarda Van Starkenborgh Stachouwer and Lieutenant-General Ter Poorten, together with Major-General Jacob J. Pesman, the commander of the Bandoeng District, met the Japanese Commander-in-Chief, Lieutenant-General Hitoshi Imamura at Kalidjati that afternoon and agreed to the capitulation of all the troops. Fujita was captured along 550 other members of what became known as the \\"Lost Battalion\\".Fujita, p. ix. Internment Fujita was a prisoner of war for three and a half years.Fujita, p. 3. He spent the majority of his internment in Omori Prison Island in Tokyo Bay,Fujito, p. 1. but was also imprisoned in Surabaja and Changi Prison in Singapore after initial capture.Oral history interview with Frank Fujita, Texas State University, 1970. He was for a time in the company of fellow prisoner John David Provoo.Fujita, p. 191-192. Due to his ethnicity, Fujita was separated from other American prisoners and forced to produce propaganda broadcasts for the Japanese.Buenger, p. 107. Liberation On August 29, 1945, Fujita and 300 other survivors from his battalion were among the first American prisoners to be liberated. Like most of his fellow inmates, Fujita was returned to the United States over a period of several weeks in late 1945. Fujita travelled via train to Texas, and via bus to Abilene, arriving in October. He recorded later that \\"I walked past my mother and baby sister without recognizing them. My mom must have been drowsy, or the sight of me froze her to immobility, for I was two or three people past her before she came into action.\\"Crager, p. 130.

Reproduction  The Mexican mud turtle's nesting season lasts from early May to September, beginning just prior to the summer rainy season. A typical clutch size for each female is 2 to 4 eggs, but can range between 1 and 8. Another distinctive feature within the species is the nostrils on male and female turtles. The females have a more rounded nostril and the nostril is more brownish as to yellow like the male. The Mexican mud turtle is an organism that \\"bet hedges\\" meaning that its organism fitness varies depending on the condition it is in. When in a relaxed, every-day state, its fitness levels are low, however when stressed its fitness level increases. Bet hedging affects this organism's reproductive window as well, allowing it to only reproduce every two to three seasons.

Directed by Canadian filmmaker Stephen Low, it features the Canadian Pacific Railway‚Äôs restored 4-6-4 H1b Hudson steam locomotive 2816. Shooting began in 2006 and continued intermittently over the next five years, primarily on the main line between Calgary and Vancouver, with the cooperation of the CPR. The film was shot in 15 perforation/70 mm film, using a helicopter and gyro- stabilized camera mount as well as a variety of engine and train mounts. The film takes the audience on a steam journey along the historic Canadian Pacific route from Vancouver to Montreal, focusing on the western mountain portion. In parallel, it tells the story of the construction of the first transcontinental railway to link the new Dominion of Canada from sea to sea and the massive effort required of a nation of fewer than five million people to connect its population for the first time. Story The building of the Canadian Pacific Railway is an epic tale that begins in the 1880s and stretches over a century, with primary construction lasting from 1881 to 1885. Rocky Mountain Express highlights the aspects of the story that directly relate to the landscape the train is travelling through. The geography is illustrated by CGI maps and the history is told through dozens of black and white archival photographs. The period of exploration and survey is quickly summarized over aerial shots illustrating the enormity of the task at hand and the variety of the landscape. The journey then begins in Vancouver with the departure of 2816 pulling a train made up of several period cars. One of the narrative difficulties was how to combine a linear and literal eastbound journey with a story about a construction project that advanced simultaneously from east and west and continued over decades. The solution was to let the journey dictate the narrative and to move back and forth in the historical timeline as necessary. As the train proceeds eastward, the film tells the story of the challenges the builders faced in the granite cliffs of the Fraser Valley, where thousands of lives were lost; among the fragile, erosive sandstone hoodoos of the Thompson River; and bypassing the vast, deep lakes of the interior. As 2816 passes through Rogers Pass, the film explores the results of the gamble taken by the CPR and General Manager Van Horne to set aside the recommended northerly route in favour of a more southerly route that would dissuade incursions from American railroads but depended on an as-yet- undiscovered pass through the Selkirks and a viable pass through the steep Rockies. Coming out of the Selkirks, the film takes a side trip southbound along the Columbia River and with the use of CGI, tells the story of the 1903 collapse of Turtle Mountain, which partially buried the mining town of Frank, Alberta, and the heroic rescue of an oncoming train. Returning to the main line, the train follows the Kicking Horse River up the west side of the Rocky Mountains and the film looks at the challenges faced by the builders and the engines coping with the dangerous grades of the ‚ÄòBig Hill‚Äô. As the train passes the continental divide, the sun comes out both literally and metaphorically on the majestic Rocky Mountains. This chapter celebrates the completion of the railway, the creation of Canada‚Äôs national parks system, and the birth of a flourishing tourism trade before bringing the audience and railway crashing back to face the reality of the inestimable difficulties of winter in the mountains, and particularly the Selkirks. The film ends with the train steaming off across the prairies to cross the continent and arrive in the port city of Montreal. The final moments are shots of the weathered stone and wood gravestones of unnamed workers‚Äîa monument to ‚Äúthe country they built‚ÄîCanada.‚Äù Director A train and history buff, writer/director Stephen Low had wanted to tell the story of the building of the CPR through Rogers‚Äô Pass following the success of his first 35 mm documentary, Challenger: An Industrial Romance (1980), made at Canada‚Äôs National Film Board. At the time the financing for the 35 mm project fell through, a disappointment which he now considers a blessing. Low says he was flabbergasted when he heard the CPR was restoring 2816, which would enable him to tell the story from the viewpoint of a live steam engine. ‚ÄúI always wanted to do this film regarding the single greatest Canadian story,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI wanted to tell it in IMAX because when you get up in a helicopter and look down, you say, 'Holy cow! How could they have done that in the 1880s?' So every single shot is an illustration of the courage of these (workers), in my view. They overcame incredible difficulties, the workers. There were a lot of deaths, from blasting and avalanches. In the end, the thesis of the film is that those difficulties made possible the things we treasure the most in Canada.‚Äù Production Production began in 2006 when Low learned that 2816 was going to be travelling through Montreal and got permission to do a few days of filming with the IMAX camera. The resulting demo was shown to the CPR who agreed to cooperate with the production of a full-length IMAX film shot primarily on the main line between Vancouver and Calgary. Over the next five years, the Calgary-based CPR and the steam program worked together with the Montreal-based production company to fit in one or two shoots a year. The scheduling challenges included the availability and location of the locomotive, the traffic on the main line between Calgary and Vancouver, the weather in the mountains, and the availability of the production company, which was also simultaneously making three IMAX 3D films.LF Examiner, The Independent Journal of the Large Format Motion Picture Industry, September 2011, Vol. 14, No. 7 Historical photographs The primary construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway took place between 1881 and 1885. Hundreds of photographs capturing that period and the early years of operation are preserved in archives across Canada. Workers, tourists, settlers‚Äîall are brought to life on the giant screen through the use of approximately fifty black and white photographs sourced from 13 archives, and featuring the work of more than twenty photographers. Post-production The five-year shooting schedule allowed Low and editor James Lahti the luxury of taking their time in the cutting room, letting the film rest for months at a time while working on other projects. Low and Lahti worked together to find period-appropriate music for the film, and the original score was created by Montreal composer Michel Cusson. Cusson also composed the music for Low‚Äôs previous six films. As a train buff, Low knew how demanding the fans would be about the details of the sound. In addition to the sound recording done on each shoot, an extra trip was taken solely for the purpose of recording every detail of the locomotive in action. Sound design and editing were done in Toronto by Peter Thillaye and his team. Like Lahti, Thillaye‚Äôs history with Low began with The Last Buffalo in 1989. The six-channel mix was also done in Toronto by Cory Mandel. Distribution Rocky Mountain Express had its world premiere on September 30, 2011, at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Gatineau. Its American premiere took place on October 7, 2011, at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. The film is distributed by The Stephen Low Company based in Dorval, Quebec.

It is the successor of the Madras Service Commission, which came into being under an Act of the Madras Legislature in 1929 and was the first Provincial Public Service Commission in India. It adopted its current name in 1970. TNPSC operates under Articles 315 to 323 of Part XIV of the Constitution of India.SERVICES UNDER THE UNION AND THE STATES History In 1923, the Indian Government established a Public Service Commission to examine the salary structure of the Indian Civil Service and the possibility of transferring some of the duties to provincial services. The commission was composed of five Englishmen and four Indians, with Viscount Lee of Fareham serving as chairman. The commission also addressed the rate of Indianisation of the Indian Civil Service and the Indian Police. It determined a rate which in 15 years would make the Indian Civil Service with a 50% Indian membership and the same in 25 years for the Indian Police. It was left largely to the discretion of provincial governments to recruit and exercise control over their services, as deemed proper. As a result of the discretionary powers left to provincial Government, the Government of Madras and Punjab proposed to set up their own public service commissions. Madras Presidency was the first province in India to establish their own service commission when the Madras Service Commission was established under an Act of the Madras Legislature in 1929. The Madras Service Commission started with three members, including the Chairman. After re-organisation of the states in 1957, several state level commissions were constituted. The Madras Service Commission became the Madras Public Service Commission with headquarters at Madras in the year 1957. During 1970, when the name of the state was changed to Tamil Nadu, the Madras Public Service Commission was renamed as the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC). Organisation Articles 316 to 319 of the Constitution of India deal with the structure of state public service commissions. TNPSC is headed by a Chairman and comprises fourteen other members, all appointed by the Governor of Tamil Nadu, in accordance with the above provisions of the Constitution of India. The Commission consists of 15 Members including 1 Chairman. Departments of TNPSC are headed by a Joint Secretary, Deputy Secretaries and Under Secretaries consisting of sections headed by Section Officers and other subordinate staff. In a Government Order dated 9 August 2011, the Tamil Nadu government brought the Chairman and members of the TNPSC under the purview of the State Vigilance Commission and Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption.TN govt brings TNPSC under vigilance purview Functions The Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission discharges the duties and functions specified in Article 320 of the Constitution of India. The commission is required to advise the Government on all matters relating to framing of recruitment rules, principles to be followed in making appointments and promotions and transfers from one service to another service, in respect of disciplinary matters affecting government servants and to conduct examinations for selection of candidates under direct recruitment to the State, Subordinate and Ministerial Services. The commission conducts departmental examinations for government servants and conducts the examination on behalf of the national Ministry of Defence for admission to the school run by the Rashtriya Indian Military College, Dehra Dun.TNPSC ANNUAL REPORT 2012-13 The Secretary to the commission holds the responsibility of ensuring implementation of its decisions, besides handling day-to-day administration, departmental promotion committees, oral tests for recruitment, etc. The Controller of Exams is responsible for notifying and conducting recruitment and departmental examinations.

The word is opposite to the word Ifsad, another important Islamic term meaning \\"corruption\\". It is also used in politics (including as a name for political parties), and is also used as a personal and place name. Etymology According to author Josef W. Meri and other scholars, the word is derived from the root salaha ·π¢-L-·∏§ (ÿµ ŸÑ ÿ≠), occurs in forty verses of the Qur'an, including 49:10, 4:114, 4:128, 11:88 where it means \\"to do good, proper, right, restore oneself or to reconcile people with one another, to make peace.\\" In sura Al-Hud, it is mentioned as Islamic prophet Shuaib told to his community, Relation with tajdid Tajdid, meaning renewal, is another Islamic term used with the term Islah in the field of different Islamic political interpretation. The person who practices tajdid is called mujaddid, but scholars such as Al-Dhahabi and Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani have interpreted that the term mujaddid can also be understood as plural, thus referring to a group of people.Fath al-Baari (13/295)Taareekh al-Islam (23/180) The concept is based on a hadith (a saying of Islamic prophet Muhammad),Neal Robinson (2013), Islam: A Concise Introduction, Routledge, , Chapter 7, pp. 85-89 recorded by Abu Dawood, narrated by Abu Hurairah who mentioned that Islamic prophet Muhammad said: By the majority of Muslim scholars, Umar II (682-720) is considered as the first mujaddid in early Islam. After then, Muhammad ibn ldris al-Shafi'i (767-820), Abu Hamid al- Ghazali (1058-1111), Taqi al-Din ibn Taymiyya (1263-1328, leading ideal to Salafi doctrine), Abu Ishaq al-Shatibi (d. 1388), Muhammad al-Shawkani (1760-1834), and Muhammad ibn Ali al-Sanusi (1787-1859) has been denominated as prominent reformers in Islam. According to author Juan Eduardo Campo and other scholars, islah is used most commonly today in Arabic with respect to the idea of reform, although this usage was not widespread until the modern reform movements of the 19th and 20th centuries; scholars like Muhammad Abduh (1849-1905, a prominent follower of Ibn Taimiyah), Rashid Rida (1865-1935) and Mahmud Shaltut (1893-1963) became popular for their contemporary islah movement. Scholars' views Salafi scholar Salih Al-Munajjid argued in his book \\"Prophets Methods of correcting People's Mistakes\\" that, Islah or correct mistakes is a basic aspect in Quran and Hadith and there are 38 prophatic ways to do Islah or correct people. Saudi cleric Khalid Bin Abdullah al-Musleh listed seven obstacles in the way of Tazkiah in his book \\"Islahul Qulub\\" (reforming the hearts): # Shirk # Rejecting Sunnah and following Bid'ah # Obeying the instinct and ego (nafs) # Doubt # Negligence (ghaflah) Ha also listed 8 ways to maintain Tazkiah: # Reading Quran # Loving Allah # Doing dhikr # Tawbah and Istighfar # Supplicate (dua) for hidayah and purify # Remembering afterlife (Akhirah) # Reading the biographies of the salafs # Company of good, honest and pious people.

He was brought into the Chiefs Council of Forty-four during the summer of 1864. He actively participated during Chief Little Wolf‚Äôs trail back to the homeland, which is now the Northern Cheyenne Reservation located in the south eastern part of Montana. He put his life on the line to save his comrade, Black Horse, during a horse stealing raid. He had a large family growing up, with six sisters and a brother. He had two children, Shell Woman and ‚ÄúMan Bear,‚Äù known as John Red Sleeve. The exact date of his death is uncertain, but he died in his home of electrical shock in the Muddy Cluster district on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation.  Family  Red Sleeve had a big family. His eldest sister was Wolf Woman, Elk Woman was the second eldest, and Medicine Woman was the third oldest. Others in the bunch were Young Medicine Woman, Buffalo Woman, and Mrs. Ford Wounded Eye. His brother was William Yellowrobe. His children‚Äôs names were Shell Woman and ‚ÄúMan Bear,‚Äù also commonly known as John Red Sleeve.  Political history  During the summer of 1864, Red Arm, along with ten other Cheyenne men, was named in the Chiefs‚Äô renewed Council of Forty-Four. This renewed council then took their first action, choosing the new Sweet Medicine Chief. They all decided in choosing the young Little Wolf, which was surprising to the people. Little Wolf, was however, also sitting as head chief for the warrior society, the Elkhorn Scrapers. He was supposed to step down from that position to serve on the council, but the Elkhorns would not allow him to step down, instead he became the only man in Cheyenne history to serve as head chief in both the Council of Forty-four and a warrior society at the same time. Red Sleeve was very active during Little Wolf‚Äôs trail back to the homeland. It was after Chief Morning Star and Little Wolf had divided and separated during their travels back to the homelands. Red Sleeve actively participated in one of the last horse stealing raids, which were led by Black Horse, a Cheyenne chief. Red Sleeve put his life on the line along with fellow warrior, Mad Hearted Wolf, to save Black Horse from being killed by white settlers. The white settlers that had shot Black Horse were killed soon after. They had managed to get away with two horses. Black Horse was wounded so badly, he had to be carried back to the Cheyenne‚Äôs main camp on a travois. He pleaded to be left where he lay to die, but the warriors did not listen. They had noticed their camp was moving out to the lands north of Pine Ridge. They were heading for ‚ÄúNoaha-vose,‚Äù the sacred mountain, which is now known as Bear Butte, located outside Sturgis, South Dakota. The Cheyenne were going to have a prayer ceremony. They were praying to ‚ÄúMa?heo?o,‚Äù (pronounced mah-hey-o) the creator. There, Little Wolf went up the mountain to have a fasting ceremony. On July 16, 1866, Red Sleeve joined the Cheyenne chiefs in a council with Colonel Henry Carrington, in an effort to secure peace. Amongst those included were the chiefs, Dull Knife, Little Moon, Pretty Bear, Jumping Rabbit, Wolf That Lies Down, Man That Stands Alone, Black Horse, and Lame White Man. They managed to work out peace agreement contracts, which were signed by Carrington himself, and the Cheyenne continued on their way to meet with Red Cloud, a Lakota warrior. The peace agreement between the Cheyenne and Carrington sickened him and he disrespected the Cheyenne by counting coup on them. He was treating them as if they were enemies. Red Cloud wanted the white people gone from the lands and he would stop at nothing to get what he wanted. Humiliated and fearing the area unsafe, the Cheyenne returned to their camp on the Rosebud. On their way home, they warned two wagon trains that Red Cloud was on a war path. However, one warning had come too late, Red Cloud had attacked them. Two were killed in this fight.

From 1388 to 1397, he was also governor of K≈Çodzko and ZƒÖbkowice ≈ölƒÖskie and from 1397 to 1422 pledge lord of K≈Çodzko and ZƒÖbkowice ≈ölƒÖskie. He was a member of the Opava branch of the P≈ôemyslid dynasty.  Life  He was a son of Duke John I of Opava-Ratibor. John I had been the sole heir of the Duchy of Racib√≥rz in 1365 and had founded the Opava-Ratibor branch of the family. When the Duchy of Opava was divided in 1377, John I had received the Duchies of Krnov and Brunt√°l. John II's mother was Anna, the daughter of Henry V of G≈Çog√≥w-≈ªaga≈Ñ. After John I's death, his possession were divided by his sons, John II and Nicholas IV. Nicholas IV, the younger brother, received a share of Brunt√°l. As Nicholas IV was still a minor, John acted as his regent until 1385. When Nicholas IV died (between 1405 and 1407), John II inherited his share of Brunt√°l. John II sold the Duchy of Krnov, which had been separated from Opava in 1377, to W≈Çadys≈Çaw II of Opole in 1384. John I had pledged Miko≈Ç√≥w and the Duchy of Pless to W≈Çadys≈Çaw II; John II redeemed these possessions. In 1387, John II founded the city of Bieru≈Ñ and appointed a certain Cussowitz as bailiff over Bieru≈Ñ. In 1391, he gave the villages of Imielin, Kosztowy and Che≈Çm ≈ölƒÖski on the eastern border of his duchy to the Bishop of Krakow. This implied that these villages were no longer part of Silesia. The village of Halemba near Ruda ≈ölƒÖska developed from an iron works founded by his brother Nicholas IV in 1394. In 1394, John II founded another iron works, named , on the spot of the deserted village of Bogucice. At the end of the 16th century, this settlement developed into the city of Katowice. In 1389, the bishops of Wroc≈Çaw and Olomouc and the Dukes of Legnica, Ole≈õnica, G≈Çog√≥w, Opava and Teschen formed and alliance for mutual protection and to preserve the public peace. John II did not sign this Treaty of Hotzenplotz, because he was a supporter of Margrave Prokop of Moravia. John II was high steward of King Wenceslaus IV and this made him one of the most powerful men in the Kingdom of Bohemia. He also held the post of Burgrave of Karl≈°tejn. In 1397, John II and other noble councillors accused Wenceslaus IV of neglecting his duties as King of the Romans and asked him to summon an Imperial Diet. The accusations were dealt with by Wenceslaus's councillors and favourites Stefan Podu≈°ka von Martinic, Stefan of Opoƒçno, Burkhard Strnad of Janovice and the Prior of the Order of St. John, Marquard of Strakonice. When these men stood in the way of further demands by John and his companions, he invited them to a banquet at the Karl≈°tejn Castle on 11 June 1397. There, he attacked them with the words You, gentlemen, have advised our Lord, the King, not to take care of our German land, because all you want is for him to become King of the Germans. He then killed them. In the same year, Jobst of Moravia had to pledge the counties of K≈Çodzko and ZƒÖbkowice ≈ölƒÖskie to King Wenceslaus, who sold his pledge to John II. After Wenceslaus's stepbrother Sigismund besieged Ratibor in 1400, John II used the occasion of a meeting between Kings Wenceslaus IV and King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço of Poland in Wroc≈Çaw in 1404 to create an alliance against Hungary. After Wenceslaus's death, John II supported his successor, King Sigismund, and paid him homage in Wroc≈Çaw in 1420 during the Imperial Diet. Rebellious Bohemians sent envoys to Grand Duke Vytautas of Lithuania, to offer him the Bohemian crown. When they traveled through Ratibor on 21 September 1421, they were arrested by the citizens and John II handed them over to King Sigismund. The Hussites retaliated by invading Ratibor. Sigismund rewarded Sigismund by transferring the rights to Krnov back to John II, who had to redeem Krnov from Duke Louis II of Brieg. John II died in 1424 and was buried in the church of the Dominicans in Ratibor. It was not until 1427 that his sons agreed to divide his possessions: his son Wenceslaus received the City and Duchy of Racib√≥rz, Nicholas received Krnov, Brunt√°l, Pszczyna, Rybnik and Babor√≥w.  Family  On 16 January 1407, John II married the Lithuanian Princess Helena of Lithuania, daughter of Dymitr Korybut and a niece of King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço of Poland. In 1407, she received as her wittum, the amts of Pszczyna, Bieru≈Ñ and Miko≈Ç√≥w. In 1412, he added the Waldhufendorf villages south of ≈ªory. After John's death, she used the title Baroness of Pszczyna from 1424 to 1449. They had three children: * Wenceslaus II (1405 - 29 October 1456). * Nicholas V (1409 - 1452). * Margareta (; 1410 - d. 5 July 1459), married firstly Duke Casimir I of O≈õwiƒôcim (d. 1434) and secondly Duke Siemowit V of Masovia (d. 1442)  Footnotes   References  * Ludwig Petry and Josef Joachim Menzel (eds.): Geschichte Schlesiens, vol. 1: Von der Urzeit bis zum Jahre 1526, fifth revised edition, Thorbecke, Stuttgart 1988, , pp. 184‚Äì202 * Hugo Weczerka (ed.): Handbuch der historischen St√§tten ‚Äî Schlesien = Kr√∂ners Taschenausgabe, vol. 316, Kr√∂ner, Stuttgart, 1977, , pp. 2, 117, 176, 203, 221 and. 411 and genealogical tables on pp. 600‚Äì601  External links  * * Biography of John II (in Czech) Category:Opavian P≈ôemyslids Category:14th- century births Category:1424 deaths Category:14th-century Bohemian people Category:15th-century Bohemian people ","title":"John II, Duke of Opava-Ratibor"},{"id":"33975734","text":"Roberta Marques (born June 9, 1968) in Maranguape, Cear√°, is a Brazilian film director, film producer and screenwriter.

The first step involves formation of a carbene from ethyl diazoacetate, which cyclopropanates an aromatic ring. The ring expansion occurs in the second step, with an electrocyclic reaction opening the cyclopropane ring to form the 7-membered ring. The Buchner Ring Expansion History The Buchner ring expansion reaction was first used in 1885 by E. Buchner and T. Curtius who prepared a carbene from ethyl diazoacetate for addition to benzene using both thermal and photochemical pathways in the synthesis of cycloheptatriene derivatives. The resulting product was a mixture of four isomeric carboxylic acids. Variations in the reaction arise from methods of carbene preparation. Advances in organometallic chemistry have resulted in increased selectivity of cycloheptatriene derivatives. In the 1980s it was found that dirhodium catalysts provide single cyclopropane isomers in high yields. Applications are found in medicine (drug syntheses) and material science (fullerene derivatives). Preparation Preparation of ethyl-diazoacetate: Buchner's first synthesis of cycloheptatriene derivatives in 1885 used photolysis and thermal conditions to generate the carbene. A procedure for preparation of the hazardous starting material needed for carbene generation in the Buchner reaction, ethyl- diazoacetate, is available in Organic Syntheses. In the procedure provided, Searle includes cautionary instructions due to the highly explosive nature of diazoacetic esters. Preparation of the metal carbenoid: Synthesis of the carbene in the 1960s was focused on using copper catalysts for stereoselective propanation. In the 1980s, dirhodium catalysts have been used to generate the carbenoid for cyclopropanation. The advent of metallochemistry has improved the selectivity of the product ratios of the cyclohexatriene derivatives through choice of ligand on the carbenoid catalyst. Mechanism Step 1: The reaction mechanism of a Buchner ring expansion begins with carbene formation from ethyl-diazoacetate generated initially through photochemical or thermal reactions with extrusion of nitrogen. carbene mechanism The generated carbene adds to one of the double bonds of benzene to form the cyclopropane ring. carbene insertion The advent of transition metal catalyzed reagents provides alternative stereospecific methods for cyclopropanation. The choices for metals include Cu, Rh and Ru with a variety of ligands. The use of rhodium catalysts in the Buchner reaction for carbene generation reduces the number of products by producing predominantly the kinetic cycloheptatrienyl esters. Product mixtures of Buchner reactions resulting from thermal Rhodium II- catalysts are less complicated. Wyatt et al. have studied the regioselectivity of the thermal Buchner reaction using Rh2(O2CCF3)4 and demonstrated that the electrophilic character of the rhodium carbene prefers reaction at the more nucleophilic œÄ-bonds of the aromatic ring. regioselectivity The accepted carbene catalytic cycle was proposed by Yates in 1952. Initially the diazo compound oxidatively adds to the metal ligand complex. Following the extrusion of nitrogen the metal carbene is generated and reacts with an electron rich aromatic substance to reductively regenerate the metal catalyst completing the catalytic cycle. catalytic cycle Step 2: The second step of the Buchner reaction involves a pericyclic concerted ring expansion. Based on Woodward‚ÄìHoffmann rules, the electrocyclic opening of norcaradiene derivatives is a 6-electron disrotatory (œÄ 4s \\\\+ œÉ 2s), thermally allowed process. ring opening The norcaradiene-cycloheptatriene equilibrium has been studied extensively. The position of the equilibrium depends upon steric, electronic and conformational effects. Due to conformational strain in the cyclopropane ring of the norcaradiene the equilibrium lies on the side of the cycloheptatriene. The equilibrium may be shifted toward the norcaradiene by destabilization of the cycloheptatriene by bulky substitution (large sterically hindered groups i. e. t-butyl) at C1 and C6. tautomerism Equilibrium may be altered by varying substitution at C7. Electron donating groups (EDG) favor the norcaradiene, while electron withdrawing groups (EWG) favor the cycloheptatriene. equilibrium position The tautomerism of the norcaradiene and cycloheptatriene can be understood based on the Walsh cyclopropane molecular orbitals of the norcaradiene cyclopropane ring. Electronic rationalization for stabilization of the Walsh orbitals is possible for both electron withdrawing and electron donating groups at the C7 carbon. The molecular orbitals of electron withdrawing groups at C7 overlap with the HOMO Walsh orbitals of the cyclopropane ring causing a shortening of the C1-C6 bond. In the case of electron donating groups, orbital overlap is again possible now in the LUMO, resulting in an increase in antibonding character destabilizing the norcaradiene tautomer. The position of the equilibrium may be controlled depending on the carbene substituents. Walsh Orbitals Applications Medicine: The importance of the Buchner ring expansion annulation chemistry is evident in the application of this synthetic sequence in the synthesis of biological compounds. While studying an analogous reaction of carbene addition to thiophene, Stephen Matlin and Lam Chan applied the Buchner ring expansion method in 1981 to generate spiro derivatives of Penicillin. Penicillin Derivative In 1998, Mander et al. synthesized the diterpenoid tropone, Harringtonolide using the Buchner intramolecular ring expansion annulation chemistry. A rhodium catalyst (Rh2(mandelate)4) and DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene) were used to generate the carbene. This natural product was found to have antineoplastic and antiviral properties. harringtonolide Danheiser et al. utilized intramolecular carbenoid generation to produce substituted azulenes through a Buchner type ring expansion. The anti-ulcer drug, Egualen (KT1-32) was synthesized using this ring expansion- annulation strategy with a rhodium catalyst (Rh2(OCOt-Bu)4) in ether. KT1-32 Material Science: The Buchner ring expansion method has been used to synthesize starting materials for applications in material science involving photovoltaic cells. The development of a donor-acceptor (D-A) interface composed of conducting polymer donors and buckminsterfullerene derivative acceptors create a phase-separated composite that enhances photoconductivity (available with only polymer donors) in the photoinduced charge transfer process of photovoltaic cells. The fullerene compounds can be functionalized for miscibility of C60 to increase efficiency of the solar cell depending upon the polymeric thin film synthesized. fullerene derivative Limitations The disadvantages of the reaction involve side reactions of the carbene moiety. The choice of solvent for the reaction needs to be considered. In addition to the potential for carbon-hydrogen bond insertion reactions, carbon-halogen carbene insertion is possible when dichloromethane is used as the solvent. C-Cl bond insertion Control for regioselectivity during the carbene addition is necessary to avoid side products resulting from conjugated cycloheptatriene isomers. Noels et al. used Rh(II) catalysts for carbene generation under mild reaction conditions (room temperature) to obtain regioselectively the kinetic non-conjugated cycloheptatriene isomer. cycloheptatriene derivatives See also *Electrocyclic reaction *Cycloheptatriene *Carbene References Category:Name reactions Category:Ring expansion reactions Category:Carbon- carbon bond forming reactions Category:Rearrangement reactions ","title":"Buchner ring expansion"},{"id":"33975798","text":"Hern√°n Abel Montenegro (born August 8, 1966), is a retired Argentine basketball player. He is considered one of the best Latin America centers ever by journalists and colleagues. Montenegro was also a very charismatic player, nicknamed \\"El Loco\\" (\\"The Crazy\\" in Spanish), due to his eccentric behaviour on and off the court. Due to his skill to play basketball, Montenegro has been compared with talented players such as Puerto Rican Jos√© Picul√≠n Ortiz, Brazilian Oscar Schmidt or Spanish Fernando Mart√≠n Espina. Career The beginning Montenegro started to play basketball at 5 years old, taking advantage of his infrequently height at that age. He debuted in the Senior category of Club Leandro N. Alem, playing with teammates 10 years older than him. He later played at Club Villa Mitre. In 1981, Montenegro was called to the youth Argentina national team to play the Pan American Games hosted in Montevideo. Two years later, Montenegro disputed the Youth World Cup in Spain, where Argentina finished 7th. It was in that tournament when Montenegro was observed by a talent-searcher who was interested in his services; subsequently, he would later be signed by CAI Zaragoza at the age of 17. Europe and NBA Montenegro playing for Olimpo v Ferro in 1988 In 1985, Montenegro was called to the Senior Argentina national basketball team for the first time to play the South American championship in Medell√≠n. At the national level, he debuted in the Liga Nacional de B√°squet (LNB) playing for Olimpo at age 19. Olimpo reached the finals of the LNB] that year although the team was defeated by Ferro Carril Oeste with Miguel Cortijo as its star player. With the national team, Montenegro took part in the 1986 FIBA World Championship, where Argentina finished 12th. In 1987, Montenegro was traded to Uni√≥n de Santa Fe where after playing a few games, he returned to Olimpo for the play-offs. In Puerto Rico, Montenegro was recruited by the Gigantes de Carolina, where he played 12 games averaging 10.2 rebounds per gane. He later received a basketball scholarship to play at Louisiana State University of the NCAA, but after suffering a broken left ankle one day before the season started, he chose to end his college career because he needed to support his family.\\"From Argentina To 76ers: A Player's 11-year Quest\\" - philly.com In the US, Montenegro took part in the 1988 NBA Draft, being chosen in the 57th position by the Philadelphia Sixers and becoming along with Giant Jorge Gonz√°lez (drafted #54), in the first Argentine players drafted in the NBA, although they would not play any official games after being released before the regular season started. In 1989, Montenegro arrived to Italy in order to play for Annabella Pavia, a team of the second division. He played 43 matches with an average of 20 points and 10 rebounds per game. Return to Argentina Although Montenegro did not keep in mind coming back to Argentina, some disciplinary affairs and personal problems with the managers caused a premature return to his native country. The return to the Liga Nacional was in 1990, when Montenegro signed with Estudiantes de Bah√≠a Blanca, his home town club. The matches of the 1990-91 season disputed for Estudiantes are considered the best Montenegro's performances of his career, leading a team where also played other prominent players such as Juan Espil, Javier Maretto and Jos√© Luis Gil. Estudiantes made a great campaign, reaching the Liga Nacional finals but the team was finally defeated by GEPU San Luis (a team that no longer exists), leadered by H√©ctor Campana. Montenegro finished the season with 22 points and 8.7 rebounds per game. One of the most memorable moments was the semi-final disputed against Sport Club Ca√±adense that qualified Estudiantes to the final games. Montenegro shot to the basket, making a 2-point conversion at the same time the buzzer announced the end of the match.\\"Hern√°n Montenegro, el Loco de la gente\\" - basquetretro.com 1992 Pre-Olympic Games Due to his good performances in the Liga Nacional, Montenegro was called again to the national team that disputed the 1992 Tournament of the Americas in Portland. Montenegro took part of a team that also had Marcelo Milanesio and H√©ctor Campana as relevant players. Argentina reached the semi-finals being defeated by the USA \\"Dream Team\\" (regarded as the best basketball team ever by journalists and experts) with Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley and Larry Bird as its outstanding players. Just before that game, Montenegro had tattooed the number \\"22\\" in his nape (a number which means \\"the crazy man\\" in Argentina), causing that the American channel NBC's broadcaster said: \\"Tonight, Robinson and Ewing gonna dream on the 'crazy twenty-two'.\\" Since then, Montenegro's partners, rivals and even journalists began to nickname him \\"El Loco\\" (\\"The Crazy\\", in Spanish), due his strange behaviour inside and outside the courts. Late career In 1992, Montenegro is transferred to Brescia, a team of the Italian Lega 2. Nevertheless, he soon returned to Argentina again to play the 1993-94 season for GEPU San Luis, and the next (1994‚Äì95) for Gimnasia y Esgrima de Comodoro Rivadavia where he achieved his best record in rebounds (8.8). In 1995-96, Montenegro returned to Estudiantes and then he signed with Valle Inferior, a team from Viedma, R√≠o Negro, playing only 11 matches and finishing that year in Venezuela Gauiqueries. The 1997-98 season found Montenegro defending the colors of Club Sportivo Independiente, playing along with raising star Andr√©s Nocioni. Return and definite retirement In February 2012, two years after his retirement, Montenegro signed with Del Progreso, a club from R√≠o Negro Province, to play a new season of Torneo Federal, the third division of Argentine basketball league system.\\"A los 45 no compito con nadie\\", Clar√≠n, 2012-02-10 Montenegro retired from basketball in April 2012, at the age of 45, due to heart problems.

History It isn't known the date when Castrillo was founded, but it would probably be by the time the ‚ÄúMaragater√≠a‚Äù did, with the Roman Empire, when Austurica Augusta (Astorga) was founded. It was destroyed by a flood in the 16th century and rebuilt again in the location where it is to date. Castrillo was one of the most important places for the reconquest of Astorga in the Independence Spanish War, as it was the first village of the ‚ÄúMaragater√≠a‚Äù where the Spanish troops rebelled against the French army. You can find much more information about the village on the following link: CastrilloDeLosPolvazares.com Economy The main economic activity of people today is based on tourism and handicrafts. Its main tourist attractions are its typical architecture and also the gastronomy, with the popular \\"Cocido Maragato\\". The most popular restaurants in town are located in houses that need maragatas rehabilitated. You can find some of them in the #References of this page. Architecture Castrillo has kept its original architecture since the 16th century. It means every building is made of stone, and the road isn't asphalted to keep its original appearance, but it's paved with stones. On the 1980 it was declared a Historic-Artistic Set of Great Value. According to some sources, the name \\"Castrillo\\" comes from the closeness of two forts: the \\"Castro de San Martino\\" and \\"Teso de la Mesa\\". Culture Castrillo de los Polvazares is the location chosen by the writer Concha Espina to locate his novel \\"La Esfinge Maragata\\", which renamed the village as \\"Valdecruces\\". Another personality associated with this town is Ren√© Clair, French cinema director, whose wife lived there until his death in 2006. In 2004 and 2006 were held in Castrillo the Napoleonicas Journeys, in memory of the Independence Spanish War. In those days, French and Spanish armies march through Astorga, generals harangued his troops, and recreates the attack and siege of the city in 1810. At first the Spanish capitulated. Later, the battle moves to Castrillo de los Polvazares. There, in the first battle, the mayor and the priest are captured by Napoleon's troops while on the town. At nightfall, in the second battle, the Spanish counter-attack, rescue and release to the village mayor. This battle leads to the subsequent recapture of Astorga.

An example of research that maintains psychopolitical validity is Bennett's study of Old Order Amish in Canada and their relationship with the state via cultural differences and industrial agriculture policies.Bennett 2003 Bennett's research investigates power dynamics between the state, mainstream culture, society, and the Amish community. This research looks at oppression and liberation at individual and community levels, and leads to local change as well as change in public policy.  Overview  The construct of psychopolitical validity runs in opposition to \\"mainstream psychology's traditions [that] reinforce oppressive institutions even when individual psychologists have no such goal in mind,\\".Fisher & Sonn 2008, 262 In addition this evaluation technique questions mainstream positivism. Psychopolitical validity asks the researcher and activist to think about power and how it affects fundamental epistemological and transformational values. *What are the political and psychological implications for the researcher and the researched? *What is the value of a given research question? *What are the implications of a community intervention developed from said research question? *How and why is research put into practice? Prilleltensky describes one component of psychopolitical validity as \\"the degree to which research and action take into account power dynamics operating in psychological and political domains and in the interaction between them\\".Nelson & Prilleltensky 2005, 136 This inclusion of power and political dynamics is hypothesized to have the ability to move clinical and community psychology beyond helping the afflicted to helping change the systemic, structural sources of inequality that affect the population. Investigation and discussion of psychological and political dynamics may have the \\"power to promote wellness, resist oppression, and foster liberation\\".Prilleltensky 2008, 116 The interdisciplinary nature of psychopolitical validity lends itself to empowerment studies and social change.Speer 2008 Prilleltensky and Fox suggest that psychopolitical validity should be institutionalized as a method of preventing wellness and justice from being discussed in isolation. This type of validity brings the two concepts together and politicizes the concept of wellness promotion.Prilleltensky & Fox 2007 Definition: \\"Psychopolitical validity refers to the extent to which studies and interventions in the community integrate (a) knowledge with respect to multidisciplinary and multilevel sources, experiences, and consequences of oppression, and (b) effective strategies for promoting psychological and political liberation in the personal, relational, and collective domains.\\"Prilleltensky 2003, 199  Epistemic and transformative components  Psychopolitical validity is divided into two components: epistemic validity and transformational validity.  Epistemic validity  Epistemic validity uses both psychological and political dynamics when investigating social phenomena. Epistemic validity considers systemic factors and power in development and investigation of research questions and in thinking about the subsequent knowledge produced. When evaluating studies based on epistemic validity there is a focus on whether or not there is an effort to understand and take into account structural forces impacting a given issue. To be valid in this way, it is imperative that there is an understanding of how \\"global, political, economic forces and social norms influence the perceptions and experiences of individuals and groups\\". Definition: \\"Epistemic validity is concerned with the degree to which community research and action is attuned to issues of power at multiple levels of analysis (personal, relational, collective). The more systematic the analysis of the phenomenon of interest in terms of psychological and political power, the more valid is the critical research and action.\\"Nelson & Prilleltensky 2005, 285 Prilleltensky and Fox emphasize that epistemic psychopolitical validity measures the extent to which psychology research investigating wellness and justice imagines positive and negative political and psychological dynamics. Positive psychological dynamics can include qualities that vary on an individual level, i.e.: \\"hope, empathy, optimism, attachment, and social support\\".Prilleltensky & Fox 2007, 801 Negative forces include, for example, \\"verbal abuse, stigmatization, or affective distortions\\". Positive political forces are equitable resource distribution, human rights, maintenance of democracy, and access to civic participation, whereas negative forces include \\"oppression, exploitation\\", each of these being dependent on institutionalized power inequalities.  Transformational validity  Transformational validity measures the extent to which interventions use both politics and psychology to create structural change within society. Studies and interventions with high transformational validity are, for example, ones that promote psychopolitical literacy, educate on overcoming oppression, empower individuals and groups take action against injustice, and advocate for coalition building. Transformative validity also takes into account how positive and negative political and psychological forces can be changed through action. Definition: \\"Transformational validity ‚Ä¶ is concerned with the degree to which community research and action strives to transform social structures. The more transformative and the less ameliorative the intervention, the greater the transformational validity of the critical research and action.\\"  Critiques  Fisher and Sonn (2008) suggest that Prilleltensky fails to take cultural differences and diversity into account.Fisher & Sonn 2008 Concepts imperative to any discussion of the importance of psychopolitical validity, such as \\"wellness\\", may not be useful across cultures, even across western cultures. They may not be easily conceptualized in cross-cultural context. In addition, they are skeptical of an uncritical rhetoric of democracy, which may fail to recognize other ways of social functioning or the ways democracy could potentially be flawed or misrepresented. Finally, Fisher and Sonn add that a strict and sole adherence to investigation and alleviation of oppression and promotion of liberation might prevent other areas of community psychology from growing.

Distinctive unit insignia  Description A Gold color metal and enamel device 7/8 inch (2.22 cm) in height overall blazoned as follows: Per fess dancette Argent and Sable, a thunderbolt bendwise Proper penetrating the chariot wheel of Helios winged with two dexter wings inverted forming a saltire with the first charged all counterchanged and upon the wheel the sun in splendor of the third.  Symbolism The aim and purpose of the unit are told in pictorial form by the story from Greek mythology of the winged chariot of Helios which was brought to earth by a bolt of lightning thrown by Zeus. A summary of the story is as follows: Helios, the sun, drove across the heavens from east to west daily, in a winged chariot drawn by the celestial horses. His son, Phaeton, in order to please his mother, and to satisfy those who doubted that he was really a son of Helios, obtained permission from his father to take his place in the chariot for one day. Phaeton had scarcely taken the reins when the celestial horses, despising their weak driver, turned out of their patch and set everything on fire. When the chariot came so near the earth that the Ethiopians were blackened by the near approach of the sun, Zeus, with a well aimed bolt of lightning, wrecked the chariot and sent it plunging into the river Po. This is the first historical record of a hit being scored against an aerial target. The shield is divided by the saw tooth line taken from Lord Delaware's arms which were the basis of the coat of arms for the Coast-Defense of the Chesapeake. The upper part of the shield is white, the lower half black, for day and knight. Background The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 61st Artillery Battalion on 16 November 1923. It was redesignated for the 61st Coast Artillery Regiment on 12 December 1939. The insignia was redesignated for the 61st Antiaircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion on 10 August 1955. It was redesignated for the 61st Artillery Regiment on 19 December 1958. It was redesignated for the 61st Air Defense Artillery Regiment effective 1 September 1971.

The organisation works for the promotion and worldwide deployment of geothermal energy technology and advocates a future energy system based on renewable energy. The IGA has consultative status to the UN and special observer status to the Green Climate Fund.Mission. As of 2016, the IGA has more than 5,000 members in over 65 countries.  History  The International Geothermal Association was founded on 6 July in 1988 in Auckland, New ZealandGeothermal Association as a non-profit organization to encourage research, development and utilization of geothermal resources worldwide. The first idea to create a structured group of organizations and experts involved in development and promotion of geothermal energy dates back to the late sixties. Preliminary discussions about the establishment of an international geothermal association took place during the Symposium on Geothermal Energy, which was held in Pisa, Italy, in September 1970, initiated by UN-DTCD (United Nations Department of Technical Cooperation for Development) and organized by ENEL and CNR. However, the time for this idea has not yet come and it was discussed further, as for example during the World Geothermal Congress in San Francisco in 1975 or during the International Geothermal Workshop in Ecuador in 1978. In 1986 there was a special study dedicated to the institutional aspects of a possible international geothermal association. After consulting experts from different countries, various international institutions and five international geothermal schools operating at that time the study was completed. It has concluded that an international geothermal community is ready to set up a unique and autonomous geothermal organization. The first foundation meeting took place in Castelnuovo V.C., Italy, 2-5 May 1989.  Aims  The IGA aims to encourage research, the development and utilization of geothermal resources worldwide through the publication of scientific and technical information among the geothermal specialists, the business community, governmental representatives, UN organisations, civil society and the general public. Structure The International Geothermal Association consists of its members, its board of directors, officers, permanent committees and secretariat. Committees, regional branches and affiliated organizations may vary from time to time.  Membership  There are different membership categories: * Individual members: scientists, technologists and other persons engaged in the research, development or utilization of geothermal energy. * Corporate members: industrial, scientific or cultural organizations which are established on a commercial or profit-making basis, are interested in geothermal energy and support the objectives of the Association. * Student members: students with an interest in geothermal energy who are regularly enrolled in a college or university. * Affiliated members: persons belonging to the Association through a group scheme by virtue of their membership in an Affiliated Organization. * Institutional members: international, national, regional or local, non-profit organizations entrusted with promotion, planning, supervision, co-ordination or performance of geothermal activities and which support the objectives of the Association. * Sustaining members: organizations or persons who wish to demonstrate their interest in geothermal energy by making a voluntary contribution to the Association above a minimum level. * Honorary members: senior Individual Members who have given many years of service to the Association and/or have made significant contribution in the field of geothermal energy.

While many ancient languages, religions, and philosophies contained numeric interpretation of events, words, and names, this article is concerned with those uniquely affecting Judeo-Christian beliefs. Although Greek culture was well-known to scholars in the first centuries BC and AD in the Middle East, Greek ideas about numerology do not seem to have permeated Jewish and Christian beliefs.

Frequently, threes have a superlative force with the last in the series underscoring a character‚Äôs resolve, for example the three temptations of Christ (Matthew 4:1-11 and parallels) and three denials of Peter ( and parallels). :Examples include: * Three major feasts appear in Jewish Tradition () * Prayer was urged three times daily (see and ) * Three- year-old animals were prized for special sacrifices () * There are three major celebrations in the Easter Triduum (the holiest part of Holy Week, the holiest week in much of Christianity), which lasts approximately three days (Holy Thursday, which includes the Chrism Mass, and the Mass of the Lord's Supper in the evening, Good Friday, and the Easter Vigil ‚Äì on Holy Saturday night ‚Äì and Easter Sunday) * According to orthodox Christianity: the Trinity Threes are also associated with the divine or counterfeit divine.James L. Resseguie, The Revelation of John, 28. In the Book of Revelation, God‚Äôs title is the one ‚Äúwho is and who was and who is to come‚Äù (Revelation 1:4, 8; cf. 4:8). The negative counterpart to God, the beast from the sea, is also given a threefold title: ‚Äúwas and is not and is to come‚Äù (Revelation 17:8c; cf. 17:8a, 11). The four living creatures use threes to extol the attributes of God: ‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy, the Lord God the Almighty, who was and is and is to come‚Äù (Revelation 4:8). In this instance, threes have superlative force, emphasizing God‚Äôs exceeding holiness (‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy‚Äù).Craig R.

Massyngberde Ford, Revelation, AB 38 (New York: Doubleday, 1975), 170. It is derived from and 12:7, where ‚Äúa time, two times, and half a time‚Äù or ‚Äútime, times, and a half‚Äù designates a period of oppression and corresponds approximately to the temple‚Äôs desecration under Antiochus IV Epiphanes (167-164 BCE). In the Book of Revelation, three and a half is a numerical cipher for the in-between times, the time between Jesus‚Äô ascension to heaven and his return at the end of age to defeat evil. James L. Resseguie, The Revelation of John, 30-31; Craig R. Koester¬∏ Revelation, AB 38A (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2014), 498. Other variants of three and a half occur in Revelation, for example, forty-two months (Rev. 11:2; 13:5); one thousand two hundred and sixty days (1260 days, Rev. 11:3; 12:6); ‚Äútime and times and half a time‚Äù (Rev. 12:4, 11); and three and a half days (Rev. 11:9, 11). 4 _Four_ signifies a sense of totality. it is associated with creation, Four occurs frequently in the Book of Revelation. James L. Resseguie, The Revelation of John, 29. See also Donald Senior, Mary Ann Getty, and Carroll Stuhlmueller, The Catholic Study Bible (New York:Oxford University Press, 1990), 398-9. * Around the throne are four living creatures, representing all of creation (Rev. 4:6, 8; 5:6, 8, 14). * Humanity is divided into a fourfold division, representing the entire creation: ‚Äúevery tribe and language and people and nation‚Äù (Rev. 5:9; cf. also 7:9; 10:11; 11:9; 13:7; 14:6; 17:15). * Fours are used to emphasize that the entire creation is engaged in praise: ‚ÄúI heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea‚Ä¶singing (Rev. 5:13; cf. 14:7). * The creation‚Äôs acclamation to God and the Lamb is fourfold: ‚Äúblessing and honor an glory and might‚Äù (Rev. 5:13). * Four corners of the earth (), or the four compass points: North, South, East and West. (Rev. 21:13). * The new Jerusalem has four sides because it is the new earth (Rev. 21:16). * Construction of the altar: four corners, four pillars, etc. (see and ); many of these altar construction guidelines are still used today 6 Both Hebrew and Christian sources believe _six_ indicates \\"imperfection,\\" \\"man\\", or \\"evil.\\" For Christianity, this occurs preeminently in the Book of Revelation. Six is the number associated with the creation of mankind in Genesis 1:26-31, and it is the penultimate in a series of seven in the Book of Revelation: seven seals (Rev. 6:1-8:1), seven trumpets (Rev. 8:2:-11:8), and seven bowls (Rev. 15:5-16:21). The seventh in the series represents the End and the completion of the seals, trumpets, and bowls series (see below on the meaning of seven as a perfect number). The penultimate (the sixth) in the series has the hallmarks of seven and even appears to be the End (the seventh in the series), but it is not. Similarly, six hundred sixty-six (666), the number of the beast from the sea, has the hallmarks of the perfect seven, but it falls short. It is not the ultimate (i.e., seven); only the penultimate (i.e., six). As Christopher Rowland notes, the beast has ‚Äúthe most of the hallmarks of truth, and so it can easily deceive.‚Äù Christopher C. Rowland, \\"Book of Revelation, Introduction, Commentary, and Reflections,\\" in The New Interpreter's Bible, ed. Leander E. Keck (Nashville: Abingdon, 1998), 659. For example, the beast has seven heads (Rev. 13:1)‚Äîthe perfect number‚Äîand a mortal wound that had been healed (Rev 13:3). The mortal wound that is healed is a parody of the slain yet risen Lamb in Rev. 5:6. In short, ‚Äúthe beast [is] the demonic counterfeit of Christ.‚ÄùCraig R. Koester, Revelation, AB 38A (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2014), 570. It ‚Äúappears benign‚Ä¶ but its true nature is not messianic. It is satanic.‚Äù For other interpretations of 666 see ‚Äúthe number of the beast‚Äù. 7 In both Jewish and Christian traditions, _seven_ signifies \\"totality of perfection,\\" \\"completeness.\\" * Jesus Christ was crucified on the sixth day, spent the seventh day in the Tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and appeared to Mary Magdalen on the eighth day. * There are seven sacraments in Western Catholicism, Eastern Catholicism, the Anglo-Catholic rites, and in the Orthodox Church.St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica, III, 65, 1. * There are seven days in a week and seven days of creation, apparently connected to the four primary lunar phases being roughly 7 days (~7.4 days) each. * In the Book of Revelation, there are multiple examples including: seven churches (Revelation 2:1-3:22), seven bowls (Revelation 15:5-16:21), seven seals (Revelation 5:1-8:1), seven trumpets (Revelation 8:2-11:18), seven thunders (Revelation 10:3-4), seven spirits (Revelation 1:4), seven stars (Revelation 1:20), and seven lampstands (Revelation 1:20). James L. Resseguie, The Revelation of John, 29-30. * The lamb has seven eyes and seven horns (Revelation 5:6). The dragon has seven heads and seven diadems (Revelation 12:3), and the beast from the sea has seven heads (Revelation 13:1; 17:3). * There are seven theological virtues to offset seven deadly sins * Sevens are used in rhetorical sequences in Revelation. For example, ‚Äúworthy is the Lamb‚Ä¶to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing‚Äù (Rev. 5:12).Craig R. Koester, Revelation, Anchor Yale Bible 38A (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2014), 390. * There are seven lamps on a Temple Menorah () 8 _Eight_ means a \\"new life\\" or \\"resurrection\\". or a new beginning. :Examples include: * Eight people on Noah's Ark (see and ) * Circumcision on eighth day () * Jesus crucified on the sixth day, rested in the tomb on the seventh, and rose from the dead on the eighth day. * Eighth day of the week marks a new day or a new beginning (cf. 2 Enoch 33.1; Sib.

Eugene Boring, Revelation (Louisville: John Knox, 1988), 183; see also David L. Barr, Tales of the End: A narrative commentary on the Book of Revelation (Santa Rosa, CA: Polebridge, 1998), 134. 10 Ten represents totality. James L. Resseguie, The Revelation of John, 31-32. There are ten fingers and ten toes, the total number of digits found on humans, thus our Base 10 numerical system. ‚Ä¢ The red dragon and the beast from the sea each have ten horns (Revelation 12:3; 13:1; 17:3, 7), signifying their claim to total power. (A horn is a symbol of power in Deut. 33:17; 1 Kings 22:11; Psalm 89:17; Revelation 5:6; 1 Enoch 90.6-16.) ‚Ä¢ The beast from the sea has ten diadems on its ten horns (Revelation 13:1), emblematic of its claim to unlimited or total ruling authority. ‚Ä¢ Multiples of tens heighten the notion of totality. For example, the millennium (10 x 10 x 10 or the thousand-year reign of the returned Christ and the saints in Revelation 20:4) represents a total, uninterrupted period of rule that is characterized by the absence of satanic interference (cf. Rev. 20:2). Ten cubed also suggests symmetry. Craig R. Koester, Revelation, AB 38A (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2014), 773. ‚Ä¢ Other multiples of tens lengthen and heighten the notion of totality. The 144,000 (Rev. 7:4; 14:1, 3) are the multiples of 12 x 12 x 10 x 10 x 10, a symbolic number that signifies the total number (tens) of the people of God (twelves). The 12,000 stadia (12 x 10 x 10 x 10) of the walls of the new Jerusalem in Rev. 21:16 represent an immense city that can house the total number (tens) of God‚Äôs people (twelves). The 1,600 stadia (4 squared times 10 squared) in Rev. 14:20 represent worldwide destruction. Fours, the number of the earth or creation, combined with tens, the number for totality, suggest a bloodbath that is not only extensive but covers the entire earth. Elizabeth Sch√ºssler Fiorenza, Revelation: Vision of a Just World (Minneapolis: MN, Fortress Press, 1991), 91. 12 _Twelve_ reflects the 12 lunar months in a lunar year, and implies \\"governmental perfection\\" or completeness, often associated with the people of God.Resseguie, The Revelation of John, 32. :Examples include: * The twelve tribes of Israel ** There are multiple examples in Ezekiel regarding construction in the heavenly Jerusalem for the twelve tribes, including 12 gates (Ezek. 48:30-35). * Twelve Apostles and twelve angels (Revelation 21:14). * The woman‚Äôs crown has twelve stars (Revelation 12:1). * The new Jerusalem is an architectural marvel designed with twelves. There are twelve angels at the twelve gates, and the names of the twelve tribes are inscribed on the gates (Revelation 21:12). The twelve foundations of the city wall have the twelve names of the apostles (Revelation 21:14), and the wall is twelve squared, equaling 144 cubits (Revelation 21:17). Twelve jewels adorn the foundations; the twelve gates are made of a single pearl (Revelation 21:19-21). The tree of life has twelve kinds of fruit (Revelation 22:2). * The new Jerusalem measures 12,000 stadia on each side (Revelation 21:16), a cube and perfect dwelling place for all of God‚Äôs people. * Twelve is lengthened to 144,000 (12 x 12 x 1,000) in Revelation 7:4; 14:1, 3 and indicates the complete number of God‚Äôs Israel, the whole Christian community.Resseguie, Revelation of John, 32; Craig R. Koester, Revelation, Anchor Yale Bible 38A (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press), 607. 40 The number Forty is a recurring Bible theme, first appearing in , \\"For in seven days it will rain for forty days and forty nights\\". Moses was associated with 40 several times: he was 40-years-old when he was exiled from Egypt, he returned 40 years later to lead the Hebrews out of captivity, 40 days atop Mount Sinai, 40 years of the Hebrews wandering in the desert, etc. Goliath challenged the Israelites for 40 days before David killed him. King David ruled for 40 years. Jesus was tempted by Satan in the desert for 40 days. Jesus remained in Jerusalem and Galilee for 40 days before his ascension. 1,000 \\"One thousand\\" (1,000) signifies \\"immensity\\" or \\"fullness of quantity\\", preeminently in the Book of Revelation.

The NKVD arrested a number of the editorial staff in February 1938, returning several times to arrest others, finally having more than 40 members of the staff in custody, leaving an insufficient number of people‚Äîseven‚Äîwho could write and translate into German. There was a new editor-in-chief, Karl Hoffmann, who, as a defensive measure, made the editorial staff live at the DZZ offices and were not allowed to leave. Hoffmann himself nonetheless came under threat from the NKVD. At that point, the DZZ and other publications were printed by Izvestia, but the system was precarious. Censors oversaw publication, but sometimes refused to meet their deadline, putting the editor and staff at risk of arrest in the event of publication, or causing the newspaper to miss its printing schedule and be issued late. More staff were hired, but they were inadequate to the task, possessing only moderate German skills, unable to write and unschooled in journalism. The DZZ ceased publication in summer 1939.

Episodes Episode 1 The story takes place in late December 1988 with the first episode starting on 23 December. Lol is haunted by visions of her dead father Mick ‚Äì whom she killed in the previous series when he tried to rape her ‚Äì and is struggling to cope as a single parent with her young daughter, Lisa, who is a result of her affair with Milky two and a half years prior. Lol's affair has also led to Woody's self-imposed exile from the gang, but he has begun to rebuild his life. He has a new girlfriend, Jennifer, whom his parents adore, and has been offered a promotion at work. Smell and Shaun are still together, but growing distant. Shaun develops his creative side on a college drama course, and grows close to Fay, a girl performing in his Christmas play. Milky is welcomed back into the gang after spending some time away, but after Woody sees them together in the pub, old wounds re-appear. Episode 2 Despite Woody's misgivings about the responsibilities associated with a promotion, he is seemingly convinced after a dinner out with Jennifer and his boss. Lol turns to a religious, concerned paediatric nurse for help, and finally pays a visit to Combo in prison. She thanks him for having always been there to support her, and apologises for the way she treated him when he returned to the gang five and a half years prior. Shaun takes centre-stage for his acting debut, and Smell's suspicions are heightened when she walks in on him and Fay 'rehearsing' a kiss backstage before the performance. Fay has a party at her house to celebrate the success of the play, and Shaun finds her upstairs alone in her bedroom. The two talk about their growing feelings for each other and despite agreeing not to get any more serious, they are unable to control their passions and end up having sex. Smell arrives at Fay's house intending to apologise to Shaun for her jealousy earlier in the evening, but walks in on Shaun and Fay in bed. Smell angrily breaks up with Shaun and storms out, leaving him devastated. Episode 3 As Christmas Eve turns to Christmas Day, Shaun is devastated after Smell caught him cheating at the after-show party. Mum Cynthia and Mr. Sandhu (now a surrogate father to Shaun) comfort Shaun and promise him that Smell will eventually forgive him. Meanwhile, most of the gang is out getting merry until they bump into Woody and Jennifer. It is revealed that Woody didn't find out about Lol and Milky's affair until the birth of a mixed-race daughter, Lisa. A distraught Woody, revealing he'd earlier attempted suicide, cannot control his rage and attacks Milky, who refuses to fight back or walk away. The others break up the fight and lead Milky away, with Woody repeatedly screaming how he loved Milky like a brother. Woody calls Milky a \\"snake in the grass,\\" repeating what Combo had accused Woody of being in 1983. Woody eventually realises he can never love Jennifer as much as he loved Lol, and they agree to end their relationship and remain friends. Lol seeks solace in a midnight mass service, but it does not ease her pain, and she has visions of Mick again. Feeling unable to cope any longer, and consumed with guilt over Combo's prison sentence, Lol takes an overdose of Paracetamol. Trev and Kelly find her and rush her to the hospital where her stomach is pumped. Trev, after being unable to contact Woody by telephone, goes to his parents' house, where they are all opening Christmas presents. On hearing of Lol's suicide attempt, Woody rushes to the hospital, where he finds Lol's bed empty. He immediately thinks she has died, but Lol's mother and friends (including Milky) inform him that she is alive, doing well and is nearby having a smoke. Woody and Milky finally make up, and Woody goes to talk alone with Lol. She tells him about her emotional problems, and the truth about her father's murder. Visibly shaken, but touched by Combo's sacrifice, Woody tells Lol he still loves her and can't be with anyone else. The episode ends with Woody and Lol in each other's arms, and then cuts to various members of the gang ‚Äì including Combo in his prison cell, eating his Christmas meal with a plastic fork. Shaun is shown having Christmas dinner with his mother and Mr. Sandhu, but still miserable over losing Smell. Reception Writing for The Guardian, Euan Ferguson said that it \\"was all phenomenal\\" and \\"roll on their next story\\". Paddy Shennan writing for the Liverpool Echo also rated the series, calling it the best drama series of 2011. However, Hugh Montgomery writing for The Independent found all the misery \\"increasingly irritating\\". The series won the award for Best Mini Series at the 2012 BAFTA Television Awards, and also led to a Best Actor nomination for Joseph Gilgun (Woody) and a second successive Best Actress nomination for Vicky McClure (Lol).

After the castle surrendered, about 210 perfecti and unrepentant credentes were burned in a bonfire on 16 March 1244. Background Although the Albigensian Crusade had been concluded with the Treaty of Paris-Meaux in 1229, local resistance continued. The Cathar Church was still able to operate and oppose the Inquisition that pervaded the Languedoc. In 1233, the Cathar Bishop Guilhabert de Castres asked Raymond de Pereille for permission to make Monts√©gur \\"the seat and head\\" (domicilium et caput) of the Cathar Church. As a haven for Cathars, Monts√©gur gained symbolic and strategic importance in the resistance fight against the Catholic Church and the French forces in subsequent years. In 1241, Raymond VII made a token attempt to capture Monts√©gur, primarily to impress the King and the Catholic Church of his allegiance. At that time Monts√©gur housed about 500 people. In the context of Occitan resistance and possibly linked to Raymond‚Äôs efforts to free himself from the chains of the Paris Treaty, two representatives of the Inquisition, William Arnald and Stephen de Saint-Thib√©ry, as well as their companions and retinue were murdered by about fifty men from Monts√©gur and dispossessed faidits at Avignonet on 28 May 1242.Zoe Oldenbourg, ibid. pages 332ff This event led to the decision to send a royal military expedition to eliminate the stronghold. Siege The Ch√¢teau de Monts√©gur was razed after 1244. The current fortress follows French military architecture of the 17th century. In May 1243, the seneschal Hugues des Arcis led the military command of about 10,000 royal troops against the castle that was held by about 100 fighters and was home to perfecti (who as pacifists did not participate in combat) and civilian refugees. Many of these refugees were Cathar credentes who lived in huts and caves outside the castle on the mountain. The initial strategy was to besiege the castle in expectation that water and supplies would run out, a strategy that had worked well for the crusaders before. However, the defenders were well supplied and able to keep their support lines open, being supported by many of the local population; some reinforcements even arrived. Thus eventually it was decided to attack the place directly, a difficult task due to its well protected location high on a massive limestone rock. After many failures, Basque mercenaries were able to secure a location on the eastern side of the summit across a depression which allowed the construction of a catapult. This forced refugees that were living outside the walls of the castle to move inside, making living conditions difficult. Apparently by treachery, a passage was found to get access to the barbican which was conquered in March 1244. The catapult was now moved closer and the living situation inside deteriorated under the day-and-night bombardment. When an attempt by the garrison failed to dislodge the invaders from the barbican, the defenders gave the signal that they had decided to negotiate for surrender. Surrender Surrender conditions were quickly decided on: All the people in the castle were allowed to leave except those who would not renounce their Cathar faith, primarily the perfecti. A two-week truce was declared. The last two weeks were spent praying and fasting. A number of defenders decided to join the about 190 perfecti and received their consolamentum bringing the total number of Cathar believers destined to burn to between 210 and 215. On 16 March, led by Bishop Bertrand Marty, the group left the castle and went down to the place where the wood for the pyre had been erected. No stakes were needed: they mounted the pyre and perished voluntarily in the flames. Stele commemorating the Cathars from 16 March 1244 The remainder of the defenders, including those who had participated in the murder of the inquisitors, were allowed to leave, among them Raymond de Pereille who was later, like others, subjected to the Inquisition. It has been claimed that three or four perfecti survived; they left the castle by a secret route to recover a treasure of the Cathars that had been buried in a nearby forest in the weeks prior to the surrender. The treasure not only contained material valuables but also documents and possibly relics. Nothing about its whereabouts is known. Aftermath Catharism continued in the Languedoc for many decades but it had lost its organization, and, under the pressure of the Inquisition, adherents if not captured moved to other places, such as Spain and Italy, where conditions were less oppressive. Monts√©gur Castle was destroyed; today‚Äôs ruins are a remnant of the French border fortress of a later time. At the base of the mountain, in the \\"Prat dels Cremats\\" (Occitan for \\"Field of the Burned\\"), a modern stele commemorates the death of the victims; it is inscribed \\"Als catars, als martirs del pur amor crestian. 16 de mar√ß 1244\\" (Occitan for \\"To the Cathars, to the martyrs of pure christian love. 16 March 1244\\").

The town was to serve as a bridgehead across the Wieprz river for Gen. J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's counter- offensive against the Russian forces storming Warsaw. However, on August 14 it was captured by forces of the Russian Mozyr Group and the Poles withdrew across the river. In the early morning of August 16 the 21st Mountain Division counter-attacked and retook the town. The battle, while minor, was one of the last skirmishes of the Polish retreat from Belarus that had started in the early summer ‚Äì and the first of the Wieprz Counter-offensive, the flanking manoeuvre that gave Poland victory in the Warsaw Operation, better known as the Battle of Warsaw.  Background  Following the failure of the Kiev Offensive, the Polish armies retreated westwards from central Belarus and Ukraine. Although the Bolshevik forces failed to surround or destroy the bulk of the Polish Army, most Polish units were in dire need of fresh reinforcements. The Polish command hoped to halt the advancing Russian forces in front of Warsaw, the capital of Poland. At the same time the Polish Commander-in-Chief, General (later Marshal of Poland) J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, was to personally lead a flanking manoeuvre with the reinforced 4th Army from the area of the Wieprz River, while General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski's 5th Army was to leave the Modlin Fortress and head north-east, to cut off the Soviet forces heading westwards, to the north of the bend of the Vistula and Bugonarew, and on towards Pomerania. The forces of the Polish Fourth Army had been engaged in combat with the Russian 16th Army and the Mozyr Group since the bitter fights in central Belarus in the spring and early summer of 1920. On August 6, 1920 it broke away from the enemy and started its rapid fall-back to the Siedlce- ≈Åuk√≥w-Kock line for reorganisation. There it was reorganised with reinforcements from the corps-sized Polesie Group and freshly trained forces from behind the front. The reorganisation was partially completed by August 10. Then the forces of the army started a flank march to the final positions behind the Wieprz river, with the town of Kock serving as a pivot. That boundary line was reached on August 12, with the 21st Mountain Division holding the town of Kock itself, as well as several villages in the vicinity.  Prelude  The Polish 21st Mountain Infantry Division was composed in large part of Podhale Rifles, that is recruits of Podhale region in southern Poland. The division included 11 battalions of infantry, 2 cavalry squadrons, 3 batteries of mountain infantry, 4 batteries of field artillery, one heavy artillery battery of 4 guns and a company of sappers. Although highly motivated, the unit was ill-equipped. In addition to logistical problems resulting from the fact that Polish Army's rifles and artillery pieces were produced in at least six countries, each of them using different ammunition, the soldiers of the 21st lacked even the most basic equipment. Pi≈Çsudski remarked, that when reviewing the division's troops at Firlej, \\"almost half of the soldiers paraded in front of me barefoot\\". The situation of the 21st was made worse by the lengthy withdrawal from Belarus, which also took a heavy toll on the unit's morale. The Russian 170th Rifle Brigade was composed of 508th and 510th Rifle Regiments as well as a single battery of field artillery. It was directly controlled by the Mozyr Group's commanding officer, Tikhon Khvesin. However, in the course of the Russian summer offensive towards Warsaw, the entire corps-sized Mozyr Group got over-extended along a front of over . Because of that it could offer only limited support to its three divisions. Group's headquarters was located in the Brest Fortress, from Kock, while 57th Rifle Division's sub-units were occupying a large area, with the frontage stretching roughly from Maciejowice through Ryki to Kock.  Battle   August 14  The Russian 170th Brigade was the only Russian force to enter contact with the Polish 4th Army now positioned behind Wieprz river. Its orders were to cross the river at Kock, seize the Kamionka-Lubart√≥w area and through Mich√≥w seize the strategically important town of Dƒôblin and its 19th- century fortress. The brigade was supported by numerous smaller detachments of infantry and cavalry, as well as the 58th Rifle Division advancing on its flank towards ≈Åƒôczna and Piaski. The previous day it offered a feeble attempt at crossing the Wieprz river near Kock, but was beaten off. However, for unknown reasons the Poles abandoned the trenches surrounding the Kock bridgehead. In the early hours of August 14 the Russians mounted yet another assault, this time aimed directly at Kock. Although the pressure of the enemy was small, the Poles withdrew to Wola Skromowska on the other side of the river, to the south, after only a brief exchange of fire. A wooden bridge across the river was destroyed by Polish engineers.  August 15  Commanding officer of the Polish Fourth Army Gen. Leonard Skierski immediately ordered the 21st Division to retake Kock. In order for the division to take part in the counter-offensive scheduled for early morning (2:00 am) of the following day, the town had to be retaken in the evening of August 15. However, a Polish attack on that day stalled. It was discovered that the northern bank of the river was by then under firm control of the Russians, who brought up fresh reinforcements and security detachments to hold the bridgehead and a direct assault was not an option any more. Polish forces on the left flank were more successful and captured the village of Ruska Wie≈õ, overlooking the river on its northern bank. This allowed for two battalions of infantry to ford the river there. Later that night additional two battalions crossed the river virtually unopposed at Su≈Çoszyn on the right flank. Although the town was not retaken in time, this manoeuvre allowed the Poles to occupy convenient positions on both flanks of the enemy. One of the battalions from the right flank group was then dispatched by way of Tarkawica to Borki, behind enemy lines, directly to the north of Kock and along the road from Kock to Radzy≈Ñ Podlaski. The role of the battalion was to screen against enemy reinforcements from Radzy≈Ñ and prevent the withdrawal of enemy forces from Kock.  August 16  Shortly before daybreak, the 4th Army started its counter-offensive against Russian left flank. Contrary to Polish expectations, the Mozyr Group offered next to no resistance. The only division initially in contact with the enemy was the 21st. Its task was to retake the bridgehead it had lost on August 14. From there it was to proceed due north, screening the main force from the direction of Radzy≈Ñ Podlaski and by the end of the day achieve the Ulan-Tuchowicz line. The following day it was to proceed towards ≈Åuk√≥w. For this task the 21st Division was provided with a limited aerial reconnaissance. The 21st Division's headquarters and reserves consisting of a single battalion with a section of mounted scouts and a battery of heavy artillery was at W√≥lka Rozwadowska, all the remaining forces were dispatched for the front. The assault of Russian positions started before daybreak on August 16. At 4:45 the Polish battalion which had been advancing along the Ruska Wie≈õ ‚Äì Kock road entered the town. However, this alerted the defenders who managed to occupy a tactically convenient high ground on the northern outskirts of the town. After a short fight, the Polish battalion was pushed back west of the town with heavy losses. Soon it was joined by another Polish battalion from the 1st Mountain Brigade. A heated skirmish ensued and the enemy pursuit was stopped. With the Russians preoccupied with the fights on their right flank (to the west of Kock), the commander of the Polish 1st Mountain Brigade ordered his 2nd battalion to ford the river and capture the village of G√≥rka on Russians' left flank. At that point the Russian forces defending G√≥rka were attacked from the front by the 2nd battalion and from the east by the 3rd battalion. After a short struggle the Russians retreated northwards, exposing the left flank of the entire Russian force. With both flanks defeated, the Russian forces broke down and retreated and by 6:30 the town of Kock was occupied by the Poles. The Russian brigade disintegrated, with its elements withdrawing in two directions: towards north-west in the direction of Serokomla and north towards Radzy≈Ñ Podlaski. The latter group reached the village of Ann√≥wka some from Kock, but were defeated by the battalion from the 2nd Podhale Rifles Regiment after a short pursuit. Forces withdrawing from that skirmish were again intercepted by a battalion of the 4th Podhale Rifles Regiment that had been dispatched towards Borki the previous night. By 9:00 the battle was over.  Aftermath  Although the operation was clearly a success for the Poles, as a result of this fighting the progress of the operation had been delayed almost five hours. The casualties for the entire three-day-long struggle remain unknown. On August 16 alone the Russians lost 198 soldiers taken prisoner of war, in addition to two machine guns and large amount of war materiel captured by the Poles. The Polish 21st Mountain Division also suffered casualties. The action of August 16 cost it four killed and 46 wounded. The remnants of the 170th Brigade of the Red Army shared the fate of the entire Mozyr Group and were defeated in the following days in what became known as the Battle of Warsaw.

The Elk Hair Caddis was created by Pennsylvania fly tyer Al Troth in 1957. He is considered a pioneer in the sport of fly fishing for this invention. Imitates The Elk Hair Caddis is considered a searching type pattern as it resembles the general form of adult caddisflies or small stoneflies. Troth created the pattern and first fished it in 1957 on Loyalsock Creek in eastern Pennsylvania. The fly was inspired by several palmered flies Troth like to fish and G. E. M. Skues' Little Red Sedge fly which featured a hair wing. Originally tied to imitate the Green Caddis hatch, the Elk Hair Caddis has since been tied in a variety of wing, hackle and body colors to simulate different caddis and small stoneflies. Materials John Gierach explains the materials he uses to create the original Elk Hair Caddis. For a hook he uses the Mustad 94840 ranging from sizes 12-18. Then he uses a dubbed body, palmer hackle, elk hair wings, and a small head to close out the fly. Elk Hair Caddis for steelhead The Elk Hair Caddis is not limited to trout fishing. This fly is also very useful when fishing for steelhead. Steelhead are the anadromous form (sea-run) of rainbow trout which means some alterations to the standard Elk Hair Caddis are necessary. The hook size should vary from size 6-10. The legs should be a medium grade hackle (non webby, but not dry-fly either).The body could be either vernille, furry foam, coarse bodied dubbing, sparkle braid, or four strand floss. The wings should be made from natural elk hair with the ends clipped short. An optional aspect of the Elk Hair Caddis for steelhead would be a flash. A flash is just a few strands of subtle translucent material placed underneath the wing.

It is a bodden, a type of lagoon that occurs in northern Europe especially on the coast of Pomerania. It lies within the island of R√ºgen, is around 14 kilometres long, an average of six kilometres wide and is up to nine metres deep with an average depth of 5.3m. The Gro√üer Jasmunder Bodden has an area of 58.6 square kilometres; if the Breetzer Bodden, Breeger Bodden, Lebbiner Bodden, Neuendorfer Wiek and Tetzitzer See are included the total area of water comes to over 94 square kilometres. The lagoon is bounded to the north by the peninsulas of Wittow and Jasmund, which are linked by the narrow spit of Schaabe. To the south of the bodden is the main body of the island of R√ºgen, Muttland. To the east near Lietzow it is linked to the Kleiner Jasmunder Bodden by a ditch and sluice gate. The two bodden were first separated in 1869 by the construction of an embankment that now carries the B 96 federal road and the Stralsund‚ÄìSassnitz railway. In the west at the Wittow Ferry the bodden has a narrow branch running into the lagoon of Rassower Strom and is thereby linked to the Baltic Sea. The western part of the bodden is further sub-divided into the Breetzer Bodden, Breeger Bodden and Lebbiner Bodden, which, strictly speaking, are not part of the Gro√üer Jasmunder Bodden. The north of the bodden is less divided. Only the Spykersche See near Spyker pushes east forming a small bay. By contrast the southwestern shore is more indented, with the Tetzitzer See and the Neuendorfer Wiek pushing well inland. The extreme southeastern shore of the bodden near Ralswiek is the venue for the St√∂rtebeker Festival that takes place every summer. The water of the Gro√üer Jasmunder Bodden is a mix of fresh water from the streams that discharge into it and the salty waters of the Baltic and is classed as brackish water with a salt content of 0.7 to 0.8 per cent. Almost the entire shore is girt with reeds. In places the shoreline forms sea cliffs that were formed thousands of years ago by breakers in the Littorina Sea, when the islands of Wittow and Jasmund were still not linked by the Schaabe. The bodden is rich in fish and is also used for bathing and sailing. There are important harbours in Ralswiek, Polchow, Breege and St. Martin's Harbour in Sagard.

A reference for the character Oskar was Oscar Wilde. Reception Brigitte Helbling of Welt am Sonntag compared the novel's use of scientific concepts to Michel Houellebecq's Atomised and the works of Thomas Pynchon, and reflected that \\"theoretical physics as an aid to explaining the world\\" has become \\"the new religion, the new philosophy in the modern novel\\".

At the time of the 2011 Nepal census it had a population of 4,956 people living in 1,119 individual households. Profile The study is mainly concentrated on Pindikhola VDC of Syangja district. Pindikhola VDC is one of the 60 VDCs of Syangja district, which is located 59 km ( 44 km from Putalibazar to Galyang and 15 km from Galyang to Chhabisebazar) far from district headquarters in western part of this district. It is surrounded by Sirsekot VDC and some part of Pelakot VDC in the east, Niwuakharka VDC and some part of Pelakot VDC in the south, Kaligandaki river and some part Taklak and Shaligram VDC of the Parbat district in the west and Taklak, Triveni and Shaligram of the Parbat district in the North. Its altitude is about 700m to 2000m from the sea level. About 10% land is only plain which has been cultivated far from land and the rest land is sloppy with coverage of major human settlement, forest, shrub land, farming land, grazing land, small streams and so on.Total 18.45% area from the total area of Syangja district has covered by this VDC ( i.e. 19135 hector). Out of the total area of this VDC, 42.5% land has been covered by 2600 landowner for the purpose of housing, farming and grazing and followed by 19.5% of forest land. On the forest area, Sal, Katush Simal, Faledo, Jamuno, Fadiyar, Chiuri, Khalluk,Kadam, Dhairo, Sour, Chap, Siltemor etc. can be found. So far the water resources is concerned, Pindikhola is major and permanent streams flows through the mid of the VDC. This stream starts from Chande choutari where two small streams i.e. Betiheni khola and Arfoudi khola of ward no. 1 and 2 meet and flows to end at Kaligandaki river at Setibeni. Several small streams of Pindikhola and Setikhola came from Parbat district also mix with this stream. This stream has been mainly tapped for irrigation and fishing. Almost all rice field situated on the plain area of this VDC has been irrigated from this stream. There are other 55 water resources including 83.63% permanent and 16.36% temporary sources, which have been utilized for source of drinking water. ( Pindikhola VDC profile 2058). Because some settlements such as Ranipokhari Majhgaun of ward no. 9, Bhalthum, Chitung, Padhera and Nigali of ward no. 4 and Bhanjyan of ward no. 6, are situated on higher altitude than location of source of water, drinking water has not been properly supplied there. Climate of Pindikhola can not be assigned to any particular type because of the prevailing variation in altitude, topography and resulting temperature and precipitation. Mainly the features of subtropical, warm temperate and cool temperate zone meet in the VDC. On the basis of VDCs of Syangja with common climatic features, it can be mentioned in the case of Pindikhola also that temperature in this VDC varies between 9- 23 degree Celsius and rainfall average at 2665 ml. Demographic Profile The total population of Pindikhola VDC is 5960( i.e. 1.88% of total population of Syangja district), where the population of male and female is 2652(44.49% and 3308(55.51%). The total number of household of this VDC is 1158 and average household size is 5.14.(Population Census,2058 B.S.). This VDC contains a range of diverse and multi ethnic society. The VDC has 46.26% Brahmins which is followed by ethnic, Dalit and Chettri by 26.05%, 13.99%, and 13.54% respectively. The age structure of VDC is highly dominated by children and youth representing 29.71% (under 9 years age group) and 24.53% (10 to 19 year's age group) respectively. The economically active age group (i.e. 20 to 59 year's age group) represents 37.58% of the total population. The prevalent caste in the study area was Brahmin then followed by Ethnic, Chhetri and Dalit. The highest percentage (46.26%) of the population are Brahmin. Next to Brahmin are Magar (19.75%), Chhetri(11.73%) and Kami (7.79%), Gurung(5.67%) then Sarki(3.26%) and Dholi/Damai(2.95%).The total marital status of people above 10 years shows that 50.71% are married with single spouse and 1.64% with more than one spouse. About 4.01% are remarried population, 5.59% are widowed, 0.18% are separated. 36.97% population are not married.The study area has population with different religion, but the majority of population (95.20%) follow Hindu religion and followed Bouddha Religion by 4.79%.The study area is also diverse from the point of view of languages spoken in the locality and by the mother tongue of different communities. Four fifth of the population (80.38%) speak Nepali, which is followed by Magar, Gurung, Newar by 13.32%, 5.38% and 0.30% respectively. Medium of communication between different set of people and community is Nepali. In terms of occupation, undoubtedly, the large faction of population depends upon agriculture for their livelihood. 94.67% household have their own land and other earn from rented land or field labour. Out of the total household, 50.17% household have their agricultural occupation depending upon farming land and livestock, 38.43% on farming land, livestock and poultry 0.34% have poultry and 0.34% have livestock respectively. Moreover, 14.33% household are involved in non agricultural economic activities also, out of which, major households(56.62%) have occupation on service sector, 19.87% on trade/ Business sector and the rest on other different non agricultural economic activities. Local People's Access on Basic Services After completion of 23 km motorable road (not for rainy season) from Galyang to Setibeni, people of this VDC can meet Siddhartha Highway within one and half hour. This road, which has crossed through the heart of the VDC have now connected to big market center Galyang on one side and with the religious center Setibeni on the other side. This road will extend huge development potentialities after linking this road with nearby another market center Mirmi and Waling- Hwas road. Now, motorable road has touched in ward of this VDC.According to policy of Government of Nepal to extend telephone services to each VDCs of Nepal, this VDC have also been benefited with access of phone services. Now, no ward is without access of telephone service in this VDC.In addition to this, the VDC has one additional post office at Dudebazar, one health post at Pandethok, four private pharmaceutical shop at Dude, Pandethok, Setibeni and Ranipohari. It has nine primary school ( including seven schools up to class five and two schools up to three class), one secondary school and one higher secondary school. Health post and schools have well facility building with toilet and drinking water facility on their own premises. Higher Secondary school has facility of library as well as computer education facility from the current year. The average distance of primary schools with the student's home is 20 minutes and the average distance of health post from health post from the villager's home is 42 minutes. In spite of insufficient intervention from Non Government Organization ( NGO) in this VDC, support on drinking water projects from Helvatas and Red Cross, School Building project from JICA, some agricultural farming trainings from SIMI Nepal is praiseworthy. From local initiative, mothers group and club have been formed and executed which has reached in number of sixteen. Locally, small market centres has been developed to provide access of different services and to make linkage with hinterland villages. Dudebazar, located at the center area of this VDC have functional access of purchasing/ selling goods, school, health, postal facility and administration of VDC. Another market center, Setibeni, though located at the west corner of the VDC, has carried also religious significance due to celebration of Mela on the special occasion of Ekadash, and Sankranti. The vital role of intermediaries have been realized to generate more economic potentiality by linking the hinterland villages (which can produce and provide local products) with local and urban market center( which can give market to the product produced by villagers).

It is a bodden, a type of lagoon that occurs in northern Europe especially on the coast of Pomerania. It is around seven kilometres long and five kilometres across at its widest point, but in places it is considerably narrower. It has an area of 28.4 square kilometres. The lagoon is bounded to the north by the Jasmund peninsula, to the east by the spit of the Schmale Heide and to the south by the main body of the island of R√ºgen, the Muttland. To the northwest near Lietzow it is linked to the Gro√üer Jasmunder Bodden by a ditch and sluice gate. The two bodden were first separated in 1869 by the construction of an embankment that now carries the B 96 federal road and the Stralsund‚ÄìSassnitz railway. This embankment turned the bodden more or less into a lake. The shore of the bodden is quite indented: for example, the Pulitz peninsula juts out well into the bodden. This is designated as a nature reserve. The water of the Kleiner Jasmunder Bodden contains very little salt because it has no direct link to the Baltic Sea. The canal to the Gro√üer Jasmunder Bodden, which only has a salt content of 0.6 to 0.7 per cent itself, is too small to deliver salt continuously. The bodden is rich in fish.

Due to lack of foreign support, the PUK guerrillas were only able to operate in the most remote parts of the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan.Galbraith, Peter (2006), The End of Iraq: How American Incompetence Created a War without End. Simon and Schuster. During this period, the PUK plunged into a political crisis with the KDP, which led to heavy intra-Kurdish warfare, climaxing in 1977. After the insurgency, the PUK entered into an alliance with Iranian forces during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, and were backed by Iran in the Kurdish rebellion of 1983. Background Autonomy in Iraqi Kurdistan was originally charted in 1970 as the Kurdish Autonomous Region following the agreement of an Autonomy Accord between the government of Iraq and leaders of the Iraqi Kurdish community. A Legislative Assembly was established in the city of Arbil with theoretical authority over the Kurdish-populated governorates of Erbil, Dahuk and As Sulaymaniyah. The autonomy plan however collapsed over a dispute over the oil rich town of Kirkuk, resulting in the 1974‚Äì1975 Second Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War. After the 1975 Algiers Agreement, when the KDP lost Iranian support, the KDP was defeated and forced to move into exile by March 1975, while the Iraqi military re-asserted control over all of Northern Iraq.Willing to face Death: A History of Kurdish Military Forces ‚Äì the Peshmerga ‚Äì from the Ottoman Empire to Present-Day Iraq (page 67) , Michael G.

Timeline Beginning of the insurgency PUK forces began engaging with Iraqi military in late 1975, right in the aftermath of the Second Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War, and continued through 1976. Those raids by the PUK against Iraqi government were not favorably considered by Mustafa Barzani, the leader of the KDP. Intra-Kurdish fighting In the aftermath of the Second Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War, KDP groups ambushed and killed PUK fighters on several occasions in 1976‚Äì1977.McDowall, David. A Modern History of the Kurds. London: I.B. Tauris, 2007 ed. p. 344 Minor intra-Kurdish clashes between the PUK and the KDP took place in July 1976, January 1977 and February 1977. Talabani vowed revenge, and at various moments ordered his troops to fire upon any KDP troops ‚Äì but suffered from operational weaknesses compared to the KDP. Upon Talabani's return to Iraq in 1977 from his exile in Damascus, he organized the PUK into peshmerga troops, setting his headquarters in Nawkan (Iranian Kurdistan) and Kandil (South Kurdistan). The first intense KDP‚ÄìPUK fighting occurred in Baradust area in April 1978, when Ali Askari's force of 800 PUK fighters was attacked by KDP Peshmerge, led by Sami Abd al-Rahman. Askari's inferior force was overwhelmed by 7,500 KDP troops and some 700 were killed including the capture & execution of Askari himself. This defeat caused many PUK members to abandon it in search of a stronger and more effective leadership. Feuding and splitting continued throughout the late 1970s, as the KDP, PUK, and KDP-I jostled for influence and funding from neighboring states.McDowall, David. A Modern History of the Kurds. London: I.B. Tauris, 2007 ed. p. 346 Aftermath The PUK and KDP jointly sided Iran in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, which erupted in 1980. Through the warfare between Iran and Iraq Kurdish rebellion took place in north Iraq, initiated by both PUK and KDP. With backing of Iranian forces the rebels managed to gain control of several parts of Kurdsitan, however after the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq came into effect, the Kurdish rebels were crushed by the Al-Anfal campaign.

The first play, Heart‚Äôs Desire, is about a family waiting on the arrival of their daughter Suzy. The second play Blue Kettle, is about a man named Derek who goes around telling women they're his mother because he was adopted at birth. The women believe him and truly find ways to tell him the way he is their son. Blue Heart is highly regarded by critics. Plot The first play in the piece, Heart's Desire, is about a family waiting for their daughter's return from Australia. Her father, mother and aunt play through the same scene, time and time again, a few seconds at a time, with variations. Some variants appear to be wish-fulfilment on the part of one character or another; some to represent a collective attempt to settle on a mutually acceptable compromise account; some include random intrusions from, for instance, a group of armed paramilitaries or an angry emu. With a more or less definitive version of the daughter's arrival, the play ends in mid- sentence. In the second play, Blue Kettle, a man named Derek tells several women they are his mother because he was adopted at birth. The women believe him and find ways of \\"confirming\\" his story, while Derek keeps them slightly uneasy and ultimately, he hopes, prepared to buy him into their lives with gifts of money - this fraud is his aim. At first occasionally, then with increasing frequency, words are replaced seemingly at random with \\"blue\\" or \\"kettle\\". The audience finds itself at first interpreting the missing words through the verbal context, then increasingly interpreting the dialogue as a whole in the context of body language, mood and already acquired information. Reception In The New York Times, Ben Brantley lauded Heart's Desire (the first play) as \\"achingly, aggressively funny\\" and the ending of Blue Kettle (the second play) as \\"heartbreaking\\". Matt Wolf of Variety wrote that \\"both plays speak volubly and wisely about language and emotions in disarray\\". Wolf stated that the finale of Blue Kettle is \\"comparable in affect to the closing lines of the playwright‚Äôs ‚ÄúTop Girls.‚Äù Moira Buffini of The Guardian listed Blue Heart as one of her favorite Churchill works, saying of Blue Kettle that \\"[the characters'] anguish is felt more fully in this desperate inarticulacy.\\" Buffini referred to the two plays as \\"deeply affecting ‚Äì not just because they are powerful drama, but because of what they say about the struggle to write. It‚Äôs as if the play will be, no matter what the playwright tries to do to it.\\" Sally Hales of Exeunt argued, \\"There‚Äôs no doubt Blue Heart is a challenge but, unlike other self-consciously intellectual literary efforts, warmth and humanity pervades Churchill‚Äôs work, no matter how weird things get. [...] The family labours under the impossibility of creating the scene of the perfect homecoming. Any of the alternative scenarios, each packed with drama and tension, could be the foundation of a great play. Churchill‚Äôs genius is that she rejects control and chooses all of them instead. The overarching impression is that there is no right way, no whole, no finished product for family life or for art.\\" Hales also referred to Blue Kettle as \\"no less compelling\\". In Evening Standard, Henry Hitchings described the writing as having an \\"unusual mix of droll realism and loopy inventiveness\\". Michael Billington of The Guardian gave a 2016 Orange Tree Theatre performance of Blue Heart four out of five stars and described the work as \\"brilliant\\". The critic billed Heart's Desire as \\"both one of the funniest short plays ever written and a reminder of the savagery that often lies beneath the surface of family life.\\" Paul Taylor of The Independent gave the performance the same rating and praised the experimental twist of Blue Kettle as \\"brilliant\\", writing that \\"Churchill makes the situation all the more haunting and queasily comic by showing how language breaks down under the emotional strain creating the weird verbal tic described above. Grief and confusion may become unutterable but communication somehow survives.\\" Lynne Walsh of Morning Star wrote, \\"To play with a simple storyline, creating the surreal one minute, the opposite the next, a writer has to have a sure touch and know how to harness the anarchic elements and Churchill certainly has those qualities.\\" References Category:Plays by Caryl Churchill ","title":"Blue Heart (play)"},{"id":"33976676","text":"Freddie Spruell (December 28, 1893 - June 19, 1956) was an American Delta blues guitarist and singer, variously billed as Papa Freddie or Mr. Freddie. He is generally regarded as the first Delta bluesman to be recorded (\\"Milk Cow Blues\\", 1926), although Mamie Smith (1920) and Blind Lemon Jefferson (1925) predated him in recording the first blues records. Details of his life are sketchy and sometimes contradictory. Biography Spruell was probably born in Lake Providence, Louisiana. He relocated with his family to Chicago, Illinois, when he was a young child. His Social Security records gave his birth date as December 1893. In spite of his urban residence, his recordings are classed as Delta blues and are noted for his musical styling. On June 25, 1926, Spruell recorded \\"Milk Cow Blues\\" in Chicago. The track was released by Okeh Records, backed with \\"Muddy Water Blues\\", recorded in November that year; both sides were credited to Papa Freddie. His second single release was \\"Way Back Down Home\\", backed with the same recording of \\"Muddy Water Blues\\". He recorded two more songs in 1928, one of which was \\"Tom Cat Blues\\", issued by Paramount Records and credited to Mr. Freddie Spruell. Five more songs were recorded in April 1935 and released by Bluebird Records under the name of Mr. Freddie. In this session he recorded \\"Let's Go Riding\\", his best-known song. Carl Martin played second guitar accompanying Spruell on the track. At the insistence of his mother, Spruell stopped playing secular music in the mid-1940s. He became a Baptist preacher. Spruell died in Chicago in June 1956, after a lengthy stay in hospital. He was aged 62. No death certificate has been found.

Career Milne Home was born in Edinburgh, the eldest son of David Milne-Home (thus making him a grandson of Admiral Sir David Milne) and his wife Jean Home, heiress of William Foreman Home. After being educated at Cheltenham College, Trinity College, Cambridge and Edinburgh University, he joined the Royal Horse Guards in 1861. In politics, Milne Home was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for the English borough constituency of Berwick-upon-Tweed in February 1874. He lost his seat in the 1880 general election, but the election was declared void and he was re-elected at a by- election in July 1880. He retired from parliamentary politics upon his defeat in the Scottish county constituency of Berwickshire in the general election of 1885. Returning to the army, he served as second in command of the Household Cavalry Regiment in the Anglo-Egyptian War in 1882, and was present in the engagements at El Magfar, Mahamma and Kassassin. He completed his period of command of the Royal Horse Guards in 1887, promoted to the substantive rank of colonel, he was appointed the 11th Regimental district from 1890 until 1896, when he retired from service with the rank of full colonel.

The area is themed to the Harry Potter media franchise, adapting elements from the film series and novels by J.K. Rowling. The attraction‚Äîthe second Harry Potter-themed area to exist at a Universal resort‚Äîwas designed by Universal Creative from an exclusive license with Warner Bros. Entertainment. After the successful debut of a similarly- themed area at Universal Orlando Resort, Universal Parks & Resorts announced the construction of a second Wizarding World of Harry Potter on December 6, 2011. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter officially began operation on April 7, 2016. This attraction suspended operations on 14 March 2020 on grounds of COVID-19 pandemic. Background Previous Universal Harry Potter attractions A Harry Potter themed attraction at a Universal Studios park or a Disney park was rumored in 2003. However, the rights to the Harry Potter franchise had been acquired by Warner Bros., which denied all rumors. In January 2007, About.com reported a rumor from a \\"highly credible source\\" that the Islands of Adventure park's Lost Continent area at Universal Orlando Resort was going to be re-themed \\"to the stories and characters of one of the most popular children's franchises\\". Other sources followed up in the next few days with unofficial confirmation that the new area would involve Harry Potter. On May 31, 2007, Universal, in partnership with Warner Bros., officially announced that the Wizarding World of Harry Potter would be added to Islands of Adventure. After a -year construction period, the area officially opened to the public on June 18, 2010. This resulted in attendance at the park jumping approximately 50% in its first year of operation. On July 8, 2014, Universal opened an expansion to the Wizarding World at Universal Studios Florida, Diagon Alley, which was placed in the former Amity Island area of the park. This expansion also included the new ride experience: The Hogwarts Express, in which a train travels between the two Universal Florida Parks, from the Hogsmeade area to Kings Cross Station (right outside of the entrance to Diagon Alley). A week later, on July 15, 2014, Universal opened The Wizarding World at Universal Studios Japan. Construction of Hogwarts Castle at Universal Studios Hollywood (March 2015) Rumors and official announcement On December 1, 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported a rumor from \\"people familiar with the matter\\" that Universal Studios Hollywood was going to add their version of Islands of Adventure's Wizarding World of Harry Potter. The report also detailed the possibility that Universal Parks & Resorts would open additional Harry Potter-themed areas at Universal Studios Singapore and Universal Studios Japan as well as a location in Spain. This report was widely relayed by other media sources. On December 6, 2011, Universal Studios Hollywood announced The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Universal Parks & Resorts executives Tom Williams and Ron Meyer were accompanied by Warner Bros. executives, the Governor of California Jerry Brown as well as James and Oliver Phelps who played the Weasley twins in the films. The announcement came with very few details of what would be built, however, it did confirm that the Gibson Amphitheatre would be demolished and a re- creation of Hogwarts and Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey would be constructed. The last show at the Gibson Amphitheatre was held on September 6, 2013 prior to its closure and subsequent demolition. On April 23, 2013, NBCUniversal made the final step by receiving a unanimous vote in approval of the 25-year expansion by the county Board of Supervisors. This $1.6 billion expansion is expected to greatly boost tourism and the local entertainment industry. It will also create 30,000 jobs during the time of construction. On December 8, 2015, it was announced that the park will open on April 7, 2016. The announcement featured actress Evanna Lynch, who played Luna Lovegood in the Harry Potter films. However, the soft opening was on March 31, 2016. Attractions Similar to the Wizarding World in Japan, this one never featured the Dragon Challenge coaster like Islands of Adventure once had, but does include Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey and Flight of the Hippogriff, along with Ollivander's Wand Shop Show, and the Frog Choir and Triwizard Spirit Rally.

This is used widely in mineralogy, hydrocarbon exploration and general mapping. There are over 4000 types of minerals known with each one with different sub-classes. Elements make minerals and minerals make rocks so actually testing minerals in the lab and in the field is essential to understand the history of the rock which aids data, zonation, metamorphic history, processes involved and other minerals. The following tests are used on specimen and thin sections through polarizing microscope. *Color :Color of the mineral. This is not mineral specific. For example quartz can be almost any color, shape and within many rock types. *Streak :Color of the mineral's powder. This can be found by rubbing the mineral onto a concrete. This is more accurate but not always mineral specific. *Lustre :This is the way light reflects from the mineral's surface. A mineral can be metallic (shiny) or non- metallic (not shiny). *Transparency :The way light travels through minerals. The mineral can be transparent (clear), translucent (cloudy) or opaque (none). *Specific gravity :Ratio between the weight of the mineral relative to an equal volume of water. *Mineral habitat :The shape of the crystal and habitat. *Magnetism :Magnetic or nonmagnetic. Can be tested by using a magnet or a compass. This does not apply to all ion minerals (for example, pyrite). *Cleavage :Number, behaviour, size and way cracks fracture in the mineral. *UV fluorescence :Many minerals glow when put under a UV light. *Radioactivity :Is the mineral radioactive or non-radioactive? This is measured by a Geiger counter. *Taste :This is not recommended. Is the mineral salty, bitter or does it have no taste? *Bite Test :This is not recommended. This involves biting a mineral to see if its generally soft or hard. This was used in early gold exploration to tell the difference between pyrite (fools gold, hard) and gold (soft). *Hardness :The Mohs Hardness Scale is the main scale to measure mineral hardness. Finger nail is 2.5, copper coin is 3.5, glass is 5.5 and steel is 6.5. Hardness scale is Talc is 1, Gypsum is 2, Calcite is 3, Fluorite is 4, Apatite is 5, Orthoclase Feldspar is 6, Quartz is 7, Topaz is 8, Corundum is 9 and Diamond is 10. *Odor :Not always recommended. Does the mineral have an odor of oil, sulfur or something else or is there no odour? *Electric resistance :Every mineral has a different electrical resistance which is done by passing an electric current through the mineral which is received by a receiver. *Relief :Shape and structure of mineral. *Fracture :Type of fracture and fracture pattern. *Shape :Mineral shape or crystal system (cubic, tetragonal, hexagonal, trigonal, orthorhombic, monoclinic or triclinic) *Birefringence :Colour of minerals in crossed polarized light (XPL), colour strength. *Twinning :Crystal twinning present and type. *Extinction angle :Degrees which mineral turns black in XPL in microscope. *Zoning :Mineral zoning present. *Mineral texture :Porphyritic (large xenocryst surrounded by fine crystals), Melange (mix of minerals), Poikilitic (one mineral grown around another),Polymorph (same composition but different shape), Hetrogenous (many types of minerals), Homogenous (one mineral type). *Re-activity :Is the mineral reactive or nonreactive? If it is reactive it usually has calcium carbonate composition. *Associated rock type :What rock type is the mineral usually associated. *Degree of metamorphism and alteration :Mineral shape, properties or form been altered. *Lattice structure and geochemistry- Signature chemical elements and bonds of the mineral. For example, is the mineral hydrous like mica or non hydrous like Jadeite.

Parks Universal Orlando Resort Both the Universal Orlando Resort in Orlando, Florida, Islands Of Adventure and Universal Studios have Wizarding World of Harry Potter themed environments. Both parks include Hogwarts Express stations allowing passengers to reach both theme parks aboard the full-scale replica of the train that appears in the film series. At the Islands of Adventure theme park, the Wizarding World of Harry Potter opened June 18, 2010. It includes re-creation of Hogsmeade and three rides. The flagship attraction is Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, which exists within a re-creation of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. A new roller coaster, Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, which replaced the Dragon Challenge, opened on June 13, 2019. Other rides include Flight of the Hippogriff, a family roller coaster, and the Hogwarts Express. Other attractions include Ollivander's Wand Shop, the Triwizard Spirit Rally, and the Frog Choir. Hogsmeade contains many gift shops and restaurants from the book series including Dervish and Banges, Honeydukes, Ollivanders, the Three Broomsticks, and the Hog's Head. At the Universal Studios Florida theme park, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter opened July 8, 2014. It includes a re-creation of Diagon Alley and connecting alleys, as well as a small section of Muggle London. It includes the rides Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts and the Hogwarts Express. Other attractions include Ollivander's Wand Shop, a puppet performance of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, and a live performance by Celestina Warbeck and the Banshees. The area also contains many shops and restaurants from the book series including The Leaky Cauldron, Ollivanders Wand Shop, Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, Borgin and Burkes, Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions, Wiseacre's Wizarding Equipment and Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour. Universal Studios Japan At the Universal Studios Japan theme park in Osaka, Japan, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter opened on July 15, 2014. It includes the village of Hogsmeade, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ride, and Flight of the Hippogriff roller coaster. Two features in the Japanese park not found in Orlando or Hollywood are Hogwarts' Black Lake and live owls. Universal Studios Hollywood The Wizarding World of Harry Potter opened at Universal Studios Hollywood on April 7, 2016. The flagship attraction is the flight- simulating ride Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, similar to the Orlando one. Visitors once wore Quidditch-inspired 3D goggles throughout the ride for an enhanced ride experience, but the 3D visuals have recently been replaced by 2D.

The phenomenon has become increasingly common in the United States with the adoption of state and local policies that favor or require green building practices for publicly owned or funded buildings. Potential benefits of green affordable housing include lower energy cost burden and improved health. One challenge to green affordable housing is the tendency to overlook long-term benefits in the face of higher upfront cost. The challenge for green housing advocates is to see to the life cycle cost of the building. Many affordable housing projects already find it a challenge to raise capital to finance basic affordable housing. Green affordable housing has taken form in traditionally wooden homes and most recently with 'upcycling' shipping containers Definition Although there is no single definition for what constitutes a Green Building, some elements recur in describing the concept. A Green Building can thus be defined as a high- performance building designed, built, operated and disposed of in a resource- efficient manner with the aim to minimize the overall (negative) impact on the built environment, human health and the natural environment. Some examples of green building features are choice of site and orientation, efficient use of materials and resources, indoor environmental quality and innovation.Zalejska- Jonsson, Agnieszka. Low-energy residential buildings. Evaluation from investor and tenant perspectives. KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Department of Real Estate and Construction Management. 2011, p. 3f Affordable Housing in the US is defined as dwelling units whose total housing costs fit within the budget of households at the local median income level. Affordability is commonly defined as not spending more than 30 percent of household income on housing. Given the higher exposure of low-income households and the need for public assistance, the most salient features of green affordable housing are energy use, material use/durability and a healthy indoor environment. Background Publicly sponsored affordable housing projects use public funds or tax breaks in order to increase the stock of housing available to low income people. In addition, these projects often seek to improve the quality of the stock, in order to offer \\"decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable living environments\\".https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sec_42_00012721000-.html, as found on the Cornell law website. Green Affordable Housing projects add to those goals by lowering the lifetime cost of units and improving the quality. The concept of the triple bottom line defines sustainability to include economics, social equity and the environment. Affordable housing already addresses economics and social equity. Sustainability measures obviously help the environment, but they can help the economics and social equity of housing projects as well. Housing units with a better design can improve health outcomes. With lower utility costs and improved health outcomes, the projects are more beneficial to low-income households, who are particularly exposed to poor housing quality and increases in general life costs, e.g. for utilities or medical expenses. Economically, sustainable design lowers the lifetime cost of a building. Since the preservation of affordable housing is sensitive to public funding, making affordable housing greener is a logic step to reducing long-term costs and increasing stability. Green design increases the economics, social equity, and environmental impact of affordable housing projects.  Characteristics of the existing affordable housing stock  The affordable housing stock varies in terms of ownership, type and quality. However, financing of affordable housing has in most cases been constrained which means quality of affordable housing construction projects often has been compromised. Policy programs that require green building standards in new construction will contribute to greening the affordable housing stock. However, new construction, whether green or conventional building, will in general be of higher quality, more efficient and healthier than older buildings. In contrast, the existing affordable stock constitutes a challenge from many perspectives. According to the National Center for Healthy Housing (NCHH) 5.7 million of American families live in substandard housing. Existing low-cost units tend to be older than the housing stock in general. For example, in 1995, 68% of the affordable rental housing stock was constructed before 1970 and another 21% were built before 1980. A considerable share of the older affordable rental stock has been removed from the market since 1995, but many of the remaining units are in older buildings. Due for example to differences in building standards, technical development and historical maintenance, the older building stock is generally of worse quality than newer buildings. Deficits include cold down draft, poor insulation and inefficient windows and appliances. Utility expenditures for low-income households Poor housing quality and low incomes contributes to fuel poverty, a phenomenomen that is more common among lower-income household than among households in general. Over the past decade home energy costs have risen in American homes in general. For low-income households this cost increase is even more pressing, for which home energy expenditures can be as high as a fifth of household income and more than a quarter of total housing costs. For that reason, improving energy efficiency has been pointed out as one of the challenges for American housing by the Joint Center for Housing Studies. Energy expenditures for low income households have risen over the past decades, and the energy burden (energy expenditures as share of household income) has increased since 1997. Mean residential energy expenditures increased by 27 percent from 2001 to 2005, to $1,522, and by almost 20 percent to $1,822 by fiscal year 2009. The mean group residential energy burden (the ratio between mean energy expenditures and mean income for a given set of households) for households with incomes at or below 150 percent of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) poverty guidelines rose from 10.7 percent in 1997 to 13.5 percent in 2009. Utilities are included in housing expenditures in calculations of housing affordability. However, higher energy costs mean that rents will be higher and/or that more assistance is needed to cover the difference between actual and \\"affordable\\" energy expenditures, assistance that already is insufficient to cover this gap. Housing conditions and health problems in affordable housing The deterioration of the existing stock has contributed to health problems for those living in affordable housing. Green updates to existing units can improve health outcomes. In addition, new housing units that address the causes of health issues improve the sustainability of the house. These units will have a lower lifetime building cost (because they won't need updates) and cost less to inhabitants (because of improved health outcomes). Costs and benefits of Green Affordable Housing Upfront cost Depending on the extent of sustainability design, the costs of green building often imply an initial capital cost premium compared to the cost of conventional buildings. Newer technology and the requirement of special labor skills are examples of cost drivers in green building projects. However, careful planning and deliberate choices can minimize these upfront costs. It is expected that the costs of building green will decrease over time, thanks to experience and the development of products and services. There are many new types of products in the market that offer green affordable housing. The type of area the housing is located in (rural versus suburban versus urban) can also play a big role in choosing the best resource in building affordable green housing. Other factors include the location of housing and the type of transportation options that it supports. \\"Dispersed, low-density housing often cannot support viable public transit, biking, or pedestrian options, all but making auto ownership a necessary cost. The true cost of housing, therefore, is the combined cost of housing plus transportation.\\" Currently, one third of the human population resides in earthen houses; in developing countries this figure is more than one half. To build shelter in these developing countries with traditional industrial building materials (i.e. brick, concrete and steel) has proven impossible to fulfill the immense requirements for shelter in developing countries experiencing rapid population growth. Life cycle cost Funds available to the development and maintenance of affordable housing are scarce and, in order to maximize the supply of housing, low construction costs are often favored in choosing projects. However, one of the main arguments for green affordable housing is that a higher upfront cost for construction/renovation can be motivated by a lower operating cost over the life-time of the building, i.e. a lower life-cycle cost. If the initial investment leads to lower operating costs and/or higher durability the higher upfront capital cost needed for construction or renovation can be justified. This is especially true considering that public funding and tax breaks (like the low-income housing tax credit) for housing often require a longer term perspective from its builders. However, the need to preserve affordability of housing sometimes restricts value enhancement over time and may thus be a barrier to investing in green features. Benefits General green building benefits include environmental, economic and social benefits. The potential environmental benefits are enhancement and protection of biodiversity and ecosystems; improved air and water quality; reduced waste stream and conservation and restoration of natural resources. Economically potential benefits include lower operation costs; a market for green products and services; enhanced occupier productivity and the optimization of life-cycle performance. Social potential benefits include improved health and comfort for residents, minimizing the burden on local infrastructure and improved aesthetics. Affordable housing projects emphasize all three benefits, because they replace deteriorating stock, which harm the environment most and provide the least economic and social benefit. The potential benefits of green affordable housing projects can be divided into direct, regional and global benefits. The direct benefits include lower utility costs, a healthier indoor environment and increased durability. Regional benefits include support for solid waste management and improved water quality. Globally benefits may include reduced energy use and carbon footprint and lower material use. Energy efficiency and other sustainability improvements for low-income households have external benefits as well. Governments, energy-providers, property owners, and taxpayers all experience direct financial, indirect financial, and social welfare and livelihood co-benefits from green affordable housing projects. The improved quality and energy efficiency of these projects result in direct financial benefit in the form of reduced energy bills, reduced outlays for assistance to low-income households, reduced rates of shut-offs and thus reduced related administrative costs. Indirect financial co-benefits accrue to residents, property owners and tax-payers and society as a whole. Examples of these co-benefits are increased property values and economic activity, increased home and fire safety and reduced involuntary mobility for low-income households. Potential co-benefits for social welfare and livelihood include improved comfort, health and safety for the residents, community pride and improved health outcomes.  Measures and Strategies to achieve Green Affordable Housing  Governments, local housing authorities, and other interested parties can either begin new affordable housing projects with sustainable design, or retrofit the existing stock. While new projects require a larger upfront cost, these projects provide a greater return on investment than retrofitting. Initiatives for Green Affordable Housing are becoming increasingly more common, supported for example by The Green Affordable Housing Coalition Standards for New Housing To ensure the energy efficiency of affordable housing, state and local governments have implemented sustainability standards. Washington was the first state to enact green building legislation in the U.S., with its Evergreen Sustainability Development Standard. This standard requires that all buildings that receive public funding meet \\"79 criteria that safeguard health and safety, increase durability, promote sustainable living, preserve the environment, and increase energy and water efficiency.‚Äù This applies to all publicly subsidized affordable housing, but not private projects.Evergreen Sustainability Development Standard , 17 November 2011, retrieved on 21 November 2011 The potential problem with sustainability standards is that projects will be more costly and projects will become cost prohibitive. While units that are built will be higher efficiency, the number of available units could decrease because of costs. A 2009 study prepared by Davis Langdon examines the effect of green standards on the costs of affordable housing projects in Seattle and Portland. This study compared \\"standard housing projects\\" (i.e. projects with no explicit sustainability goals) and projects attempting to achieve Built Green or LEED certification. The study includes both public and private affordable housing projects. At the time of the study, both cities had high sustainability standards for public projects, and Washington has only increased that standard since then. Construction cost analysis (in terms of cost per square foot) showed no significant difference between standard projects and green-rated projects. The study is limited by a small sample size, because of which they could not compare public and privately funded projects.Cost of Green Affordable Housing Study , Davis Langdon, July 2009, retrieved 21 November 2011 Updating Existing Housing Stock Many jurisdictions offer options for updating the energy efficiency of existing housing stock. The US Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) offers the chance for low-income families to improve their housing in order to reduce energy consumption and costs. WAP uses funds from the federal Department of Energy. Federal funds are distributed by state offices and services are provided by local agencies.Weatherization Assistance, 14 September 2010, retrieved 21 November 2011 WAP has suffered because of increased competition for federal funds. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) designated funds for WAP. The program as a whole was criticized for its failure to distribute these funds effectively.Obama's Weatherizing Program Lags Far behind on its Job Goals , Garance Burke, 28 March 2010, retrieved 21 November 2011 Energy-efficient appliances are another method for households to decrease energy use. Low-income households have trouble realizing this gain energy efficiency. Energy-efficient appliances require a large up-front investment, and savings will not be realized for many years. Local grantees have the option to use Weatherization funds to support appliance purchases. However, unlike weatherization programs, the gains in household budgets are often not worth the investment. A 2010 study examined the households' purchasing habits in regard to high-efficiency appliances. Using household- level data, this study determines that homeowners are significantly more likely to own energy efficient large appliances, such as refrigerators or washing machines. However, the results show that the cost of this problem is negligible compared to overall energy consumption. This finding is important considering the increasing efficiency standards for household appliances. A higher standard may put simple appliances out of the price range of low income households, while not offering much energy relief for households that do own them.Evaluating the Slow Adoption of Energy Efficient Investments, Lucas W. Davis, June 2010, retrieved 21 November 2011  Evaluation of Green Affordable Housing policies and incentives  As Green Affordable Housing still is a rather marginal phenomenon the outcomes of policy programs and specific interventions remain to be examined and confirmed. However, a number of studies are underway to examine the effects on health, energy savings and project costs. Other research initiatives seek to develop Green Affordable Housing while continuously evaluating the efforts. Some early learning point to the importance of training, outreach and resource coordination for the success of a green affordable housing program.

They have now spread throughout the country, being absent only in inhospitable environments. The general public has a benign attitude to them but conservationists and regional councils regard these animals as pests as they prey on native animals and compete with them for food. Introductions and distribution Discussions on importing hedgehogs into New Zealand began as early as 1868. The first recorded introductions of the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus occidentalis) were by the Canterbury Acclimatisation Society in 1870, with subsequent introductions in 1871, 1885, 1890 and 1894. It is likely that they all came from Britain. Beyond acclimatisation, hedgehogs were also introduced to control garden pests such as slugs, snails and grass grubs. Throughout much of the 20th century New Zealand-born hedgehogs were liberated in many parts of the country, from those few animals, hedgehog numbers increased dramatically. In the 1920s hedgehogs were so numerous that they were blamed for reducing the tally of small game birds and a bounty was put on their noses. By the 1950s hedgehog numbers reached their maximum. To judge by roadkill figures, hedgehogs were 50 times more numerous in New Zealand than anywhere else. Since the 1950s, their numbers have fallen but over large parts of New Zealand hedgehogs are still more numerous than in Britain. By 1972 they may have reached their maximum range. Today hedgehogs are present in almost all habitats, including urban, rural, braided river and forests areas. The few areas they are not present in are inhospitable environments like above the permanent snow line and in the wettest parts of Fiordland. Acclimatisation to New Zealand habitat Australasian harrier hawk chick with dead hedgehog Since coming to New Zealand the hedgehog has grown a little smaller and never reaches the size or weight of animals in Britain and continental Europe. This is because European animals must reach a larger size and greater weight to survive the 6 month long period of hibernation. In central and southern New Zealand, hedgehogs hibernate for about three months of the year but few hibernate at all in the warmer northern parts of the country. Wild pigs, dogs, cats are predators of the hedgehog, and the flightless, endemic weka and Pukeko will prey on nestlings. The Australasian harrier hawk scavenges road killed hedgehogs (along with anything else killed on the roads), but it is unknown whether they actively prey on them. Timms trap Relationships with humans Many people have a benign attitude to these introduced predators who eat garden pests, and a few have implemented hedgehog rescue efforts. Following studies, the Department of Conservation (DOC), regional and local councils have now recognised the damage hedgehogs cause and now actively attempt to manage their population. Threat to native fauna Hedgehog eating black-fronted tern egg Hedgehogs prey on the endangered, endemic giant snails (Powelliphanta), the endemic wƒìtƒÅ species, and various other native invertebrates. The critically endangered Cromwell chafer beetle (Prodontria lewisi) is threatened due to predation by hedgehogs as well as other introduced species. Their diet includes the eggs and chicks of ground-nesting birds, so they may have already contributed to the decline and extinction of up to fifteen bird species and are a threat to those that remain. Also they are yet another threat to endangered native skinks. Hedgehogs are therefore humanely controlled in many parts of New Zealand. DOC says on its website \\"You can help stop hedgehogs, don‚Äôt encourage them into your backyard by creating burrows for them or leaving milk out. Set a suitable trap for the situation you are in (suburban or rural).\\" and goes onto describe the trapping systems recommended which are kill traps.http://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/pests-and-threats/animal-pests/hedgehogs/ Diseases Young hedgehog with skin diseases In Europe hedgehogs carry a large number of the hedgehog flea (Archaeopsylla erinacei). But it appears that none survived the six-month voyage to New Zealand in the 19th century, so the New Zealand animals are free of fleas. But they suffer from another ectoparasite - mange mites (Caparinia tripilis) which are environmental and are not hedgehog exclusive. These mites bury their eggs in the skin where they later hatch and cause many health issues for the hedgehog host. The parasite blinds and kills large numbers of hedgehogs and probably played a big role in reducing their numbers. These are the same mites that may be carried by domesticated cats and dogs, and are environmental mites.

It forms part of his overall structure of systematized acting training, most frequently called the System, which in its turn gave rise to Method Acting. In his writings on theatre, Stanislavski states \\"The basis of theatre is doing, dynamism. [...] In Latin, the corresponding word is actio, and the root of this same word has passed into our vocabulary, \\"action\\", \\"actor\\", \\"act\\". So, drama is an action we can see being performed, and, when he comes on, the actor becomes an agent in that action\\" and \\"acting is action - mental and physical.\\" Jean Benedetti understands action in a Stanislavskian context more simply as \\"What is done in order to fulfill a Task,\\" a Task in its turn referring to \\"What a character has to do, the problem he has to solve.\\" Action as a term in theatre practice derived from the Stanislavski System therefore refers to that which a character undertakes in order to achieve a goal.

This enables the team to avoid risking injury to the starters, and to give real life playing practice to backup players. Veteran starters are also frequently rested in the final preseason games in order to get them ready for the early part of the season. Also, starters are sometimes rested during a game during garbage time when the outcome is mostly certain. While usually garbage time takes place toward the end of the fourth quarter of a game, in games where there is such a vast difference in talent and the winning team very quickly gains a large lead, the starters will be removed from the game early‚Äîsometimes well before the end of the first half‚Äîand the second- and lower-string players will play the remainder of the contest. As such, the starters play long enough only to gain a significant lead, and giving the reserves extended playing time. Effects on players, team and league The debate on whether or not it is a good idea to rest starters has not been resolved. Some analysts argue that it is good for the team by enabling the bodies of the players to be fresh, while others state it could make them more rusty. While resting starters may have the advantage of preventing injuries, it may deprive them of various statistics they are trying to accomplish, particularly individual season records. In sports with a small number of games per season, such as gridiron football, there is also the argument over whether it is better for a team with a perfect record up to that point to rest players or to try for the perfect season. For example, the 2007 New England Patriots did not rest their starters and accomplished a perfect 16‚Äì0 regular season in a victory against the New York Giants (who also played their starters), but ultimately lost Super Bowl XLII to the same Giants team. The 2009 Indianapolis Colts, after starting 14‚Äì0 and clinching home field advantage throughout the playoffs, rested their starters and lost the final 2 games. They made it to Super Bowl XLIV, which they also lost. The 2011 Green Bay Packers rested their starting quarterback Aaron Rodgers on the final game of the regular season, as the Packers had already secured the #1 seed in the NFC playoffs. Combined with the bye week earned with that seed, it would be a total of 3 weeks before Rodgers would play in a game again. The Packers lost their subsequent Divisional game vs. the New York Giants, leading commentators to wonder if the extra time off had been a detriment to Rodgers, as several crucial passes were dropped by the Packers in the game. Resting the starters can be controversial if the game has playoff implications for the opponents. In such a scenario, the opposition could secure a playoff berth at the expense of another team. In extreme cases, teams have been accused of deliberately giving their opponents a better chance of winning where that week's opposition's presence in the playoffs is preferred to another team's, which could be considered \\"tanking\\" (a form of match fixing). A notable example of this was when the San Francisco 49ers, who had clinched a playoff berth, rested several starters and lost their regular-season finale in 1988 to the Los Angeles Rams, thereby knocking the New York Giants out of the postseason on tiebreakers (obstinately as the Giants had defeated the 49ers in the playoffs in both 1985 and 1986, also injuring 49er quarterback Joe Montana in the latter year's game); after the 49ers-Rams game, Giants quarterback Phil Simms angrily accused the 49ers of \\"laying down like dogs.\\" In 1993, the National Football League experimented with a two-bye week format. After the success of expanding the regular season to a period of 17 weeks in the 1990 NFL season, the league hoped this new schedule would generate even more revenue. However, teams felt that having two weeks off during the regular season was too disruptive for their weekly routines, and thus it reverted to 17 weeks immediately after the season ended. The negative effects of having two bye weeks can be similar to the negative effects of resting starters, as having several weeks off (in the case of a division winner, several consecutive weeks off), a player's routine can be hurt. Another proposal for a two-bye-week season, part of a proposal to extend the season to 17 games over 19 weeks, is being discussed in collective bargaining agreement negotiations for the agreement set to take effect in 2021.

V√§sterg√∂tland Runic Inscription 73 or Vg 73 is the Rundata catalog number for a Viking Age memorial runestone that is located near the Synnerby church, which is about nine kilometers west of Skara. The stone was raised in memory of a man who was a thegn. Description The inscription on Vg 73 consists of runes carved in the younger futhark in a text band that runs along the edge of a tall, narrow stone that is 2.55 meters in height and then curves into the center. A cross is at the top of the inscription. The stone is classified as being carved in runestone style RAK, which is considered to be the oldest style. This is the classification where the ends of the text bands are straight and do not have any attached serpent or beast heads. The stone was noted in a wall of the church in 1936, and was removed and raised in its present location in the churchyard. Before the historic significance of runestones was recognized, they were often re-used as materials in the construction of churches, walls, and bridges. The runic text states that the stone was raised by two brothers named K√°rr and Kali or Kalli in memory of their father V√©ur√∞r. The runic inscription states in Old Norse that the father was miok go√∞an √æegn or \\"a very good thegn.\\" The exact role of thegns in southern Sweden is a matter of debate, but the most common view is that these persons constituted a Nordic elite somehow connected to Danish royal power. About fifty other runestones refer to the deceased being a thegn. Of these, four other runestones use exactly the same phrase, miok go√∞an √æegn, Vg 108 in T√§ngs gamla, Vg 137 S√∂rby, Vg 150 in Velanda, and DR 99 in Bjerregrav. The name of the father combines the Old Norse words v√© and ur√∞r for a name that means \\"guardian of the holy place A drawing of Vg 73 while part of the church wall is on page 104. or sanctuary.\\". p. 18. While this may have been a family name inherited from a go√∞i, which is an Old Norse term for a priest or chieftain, that the father was also a thegn suggests that he was a local chieftain with responsibilities for caring for and arranging feasts at a religious sanctuary. Although the sons were Christian as indicated by their use of a cross in the inscription, one has the name K√°rr which is Old Norse for \\"lock of hair\\" or \\"curly hair.\\" It has been suggested that this was a name associated with cultic initiates who grew long hair, and supports an identification of the figure on the inscription as being that of the father in ritual attire. The name K√°rr was often combined with that of Odin in √ì√∞ink√°rr, and appears in a possible cultic initiate reference in the names on inscriptions on DR 4 in Hedeby, DR 81 in Skjern, DR 133 in Skivum, and DR 239 in G√∏rlev. The name K√°rr is used on Vg 56 in K√§llby, which depicts a figure possibly in cultic attire. K√°rr is also used without necessarily any cultic reference in inscriptions Sm 90 in Torshag, S√∂ 128 in Lids, U 643 and U 644 in Ekilla bro, U 654 in Varpsund, and U 792 in Ulunda, with U 644 and U 654 referring to the same person. The anonymous runemaster used a punctuation mark to divide each word in the runic text. Most words were divided with an √ó, but the phrase \\"his father\\" is separated from the first part of the sentence by two dots, and the three Norse words in the phrase meaning \\"a very good thegn\\" were each separated with a single dot. The runestone is known locally as Veur√∞s sten or \\"Veur√∞'s stone.\\" The Synnerby church. Inscription Transliteration of the runes into Latin characters :√ó kar Ä √ó auk √ó kali √ó reistu √ó stin √ó √æensi √ó efti Ä √ó ueur√æ : fa√æur √ó sin * muk * ku√æan * √æekn *Project Samnordisk Runtextdatabas Svensk - Rundata entry for Vg 73.

Reputation  Jonah Barrington called him a \\"very excellent private character\\" but did not rate his judicial qualities very highly. According to Barrington, Henn was \\"dreadfully puzzled\\" when he was hearing a case while on assize at Wexford in about 1789 by the arguments of two young barristers, each of whom pleaded with great eloquence that the law was in his client's favour. Having argued their contradictory positions at length, they requested the judge to give his ruling. Henn, at a loss as to which side was in the right, whispered to his registrar: \\"I wish to God I knew what the law really was!\\", to which the registrar replied that if he knew what the law was, he would happily share his knowledge with the judge.Barrington, Jonah Personal Sketches of his Own Times Henry Colburn London 1827 Vol.1 pp.453-4 John Scott, 1st Earl of Clonmell, who presided in the King's Bench where Henn was a junior judge, had a very low opinion of him, calling him \\"at best a fool\\".Lenox-Conyngham p.59 Admittedly Scott in his diary privately expressed his contempt for nearly all the Irish judges of his time, including some with whom he was outwardly friendly: Henn's cousin John Bennett he saw as his particular enemy.Ball p.175  Family  William Henn married Elizabeth Parry; he was the father of William Henn junior, a Master in Chancery, and grandfather of Jonathan Henn, a barrister, who is best remembered for prosecuting John Mitchel.

He entered sumo in March 2003, reaching the top makuuchi division in July 2011. His highest rank to date has been maegashira 4, which he achieved in July 2013 after he put together five straight kachi-koshi or winning records in the top division. However, he was ranked in makushita, the third division, from May 2017 until July 2020. He wrestles for Tamanoi stable. Early life and sumo background Kazuyoshi Shibuya went to primary school and junior high school in the Adachi, Tokyo. He began practicing sumo in his fifth year of primary school and in his sixth year came in a second in a national primary school sumo tournament. He had been going to Tamanoi stable regularly for practice since primary school as his sumo club had an ongoing relationship with the stable, and this was the stable he ultimately chose to join after junior high school. Career He made his debut in March 2003, the same tournament as later j≈´ry≈ç contemporary Sadanoumi. He rose gradually to the ranks of makushita and was working his way up, but would start to suffer from pain due to a neck injury and would eventually drop back down to the fourth tier sandanme division. After two tournaments here he would slowly work his way through makushita again. He reached the elite sekitori ranks in January 2011, a little over seven years after his professional debut. His rise through j≈´ry≈ç and onto the top-tier makuuchi division was surprisingly smooth compared to his struggles in lower divisions, undoubtedly helped by the forced retiring of several j≈´ry≈ç and lower makuuchi wrestlers due to an unprecedented match-fixing scandal. In these circumstances, a relatively average record of 9‚Äì6 at j≈´ry≈ç #8 would allow him promotion to the makuuchi division in July of that year. A member of Tamanoi stable, he is the first top division wrestler produced by Tamanoi's head coach, the former ozeki Tochiazuma Daisuke. This first makuuchi tournament would be a very successful 10‚Äì5 record which would allow him to rise higher through the ranks, but his following four efforts were all losing tournaments which saw him slide back to maegashira 15. A very disappointing 3‚Äì12 score in the May 2012 tournament saw him demoted back to the j≈´ry≈ç division, but upon his return to the top division he put together a string of five consecutive 8‚Äì7 records which eventually saw him promoted to his highest rank to date of maegashira 4. He sat out the March 2014 tournament, recuperating after a detached retina operation. This led to his demotion back to j≈´ry≈ç for the following May 2014 tournament where he only managed a 7‚Äì8 record. He won the j≈´ry≈ç division championship in March 2015 and was promoted back to makuuchi, but his return to the top division lasted only one tournament as he could only score 3‚Äì12. This has been his last makuuchi appearance to date. He was demoted to the makushita division after the September 2016 tournament, but promoted back to j≈´ry≈ç for March 2017 after a 5‚Äì2 score at makushita 3 in January. His stay in j≈´ry≈ç lasted only one tournament and he was back in the makushita division in May 2017. He reached the top rank of the makushita division, #1 East, in May 2019 but just failed to get the majority of wins that would have returned him to j≈´ry≈ç, scoring 3‚Äì4. However, he remained near the top of the makushita division and he returned to j≈´ry≈ç after 18 tournaments away for the July 2020 tournament (originally scheduled for May). He maintained his position in j≈´ry≈ç for the September 2020 tournament, but was prevented from entering it due to a covid-19 outbreak at his stable. Fujiazuma was one of the 19 wrestlers who tested positive. Fighting style Fujiazuma weighs 183 kg, making him one of the heaviest wrestlers in makuuchi. He wins most of his bouts by pushing and thrusting; his most common winning kimarite or technique is oshi dashi (push out).

Odio provided testimony to the Warren Commission investigating the assassination of John F. Kennedy that Lee Harvey Oswald was one of three men who visited her Dallas, Texas apartment in September 1963 to solicit money for the anti-Castro cause. Background Odio was born in Havana, Cuba in 1937; she remained in Cuba until 1960. She was one of ten children born to Amador and Sarah Odio. Her brother, Cesar, was a city manager of Miami, Florida for eleven years. Warren Commission testimony and investigation On July 22, 1964, Odio provided testimony to Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the Warren Commission, at the US Post Office Building in Dallas. She stated that in September 1963, three men, whom she described as two Cubans and an American, came to her Dallas apartment and asked her to help them prepare a letter to solicit funds for an anti-Castro organization in which she was involved, the Cuban Revolutionary Junta (JURE). Odio testified that one of the Cubans identified himself by the \\"war name\\" of \\"Leopoldo\\" and that the American was introduced to her as \\"Leon Oswald\\". She said \\"Leopoldo\\" told her that the American was in the Marine Corps and was an excellent shot. According to Odio, the American said Cubans \\"don't have any guts ... because President Kennedy should have been assassinated after the Bay of Pigs, and some Cubans should have done that, because he was the one that was holding the freedom of Cuba actually.\\" She said the men told her that they had come from New Orleans and were about to leave on a trip. Odio testified that she was certain that \\"Leon Oswald\\" was Lee Harvey Oswald and that the meeting occurred prior October 1, likely on the preceding Thursday (September 26) or Friday (September 27). The Warren Commission stated in its final report that it examined Oswald's known or alleged contacts and activities in an attempt to determine whether or not he was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy, and that it investigated Odio's statements as part of that examination. The Commission said its investigation showed that Oswald left Dallas for New Orleans on April 24, 1963 and lived there until traveling to Mexico City in late September. It stated he was in New Orleans at least until September 23, the day Ruth Paine took Marina Oswald back to Dallas, and that the timeline of the delivery of an unemployment check he cashed \\"firmly established\\" his presence in New Orleans on September 25. The Warren Commission said Oswald may have taken a Continental Trailways bus from New Orleans to Houston on the September 25, and that there was \\"strong evidence\\" in the form of ticket purchase records and eyewitness reports that he took a bus from Houston to Laredo, Texas on September 26. According to the Warren Commission, other evidence established that Oswald had crossed into Mexico on September 26 and out on October 3, the same day he returned to Dallas. The Commission noted a window of time between the morning of September 25 and the early morning of September 26 for which they could not account, but stated that it was not plausible or supported by the evidence that Oswald took a car, bus, or airplane from New Orleans to Dallas to see Odio, then back to Houston where he departed for Laredo in that period of time. It also stated that comments Oswald made to passengers on the bus to Laredo and a telephone call he placed to a resident in Houston indicated that he was not in Dallas on September 25 but was traveling from New Orleans. The Warren Commission was \\"almost certain\\" that Oswald could not have been in Dallas in the time period specified by Odio, however, they requested that the FBI conduct further investigation of her testimony, including the possibility that Oswald may have been with others during his trip to Mexico. In an effort to locate and identify the men Odio said were with Oswald, the FBI interviewed two anti-Castro leaders who denied knowing anything about Odio's allegations. The Commission said that additional investigation, including another interview of Odio, was conducted to find the men who had visited her apartment. It reported that the FBI had located another participant in anti-Castro activities, Loran Eugene Hall, who stated he had visited Odio in September 1964 with Lawrence Howard and William Seymour. Their final report stated: \\"While the FBI had not yet completed its investigation into this matter at the time the report went to press, the Commission has concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald was not at Mrs. Odio's apartment in September of 1963.\\" House Select Committee on Assassinations investigation The United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) stated in its final report published in 1979 that they investigated the possible involvement in the assassination by a number of anti-Castro Cuban groups and individuals. The committee's report summarized the Warren Commission's findings regarding the \\"Odio incident\\" and stated that J. Lee Rankin did not receive portions of the FBI's investigation until after the commission's final report had been published. According to the HSCA, Howard and Seymour denied having met Odio, and Hall later retracted his statement that the three of them met Odio. Odio was again interviewed by the House Select Committee, as were her family, her psychiatrist, Hall, Howard, Seymour, and the FBI agent who had interviewed Hall. The HSCA reported that it was \\"inclined to believe Silvia Odio\\" and that at least one of the men looked like Oswald. The Committee stated that it did not agree with the Warren Commission that Oswald could not have been in Dallas during the time period specified in Odio's allegations, and reported the most likely dates for the encounter to be the 25th, 26th, and 27 September. The HSCA stated that Oswald's actions and values were consistent with someone who would favor the Castro regime, and speculated that Oswald may have associated with anti-Castro activists in order to implicate that movement in the assassination or for some unrelated reason. The Committee concluded that \\"it was unable to reach firm conclusions as to the meaning or significance of the Odio incident to the President's assassination.\\" Reliability as a witness Author Gerald Posner profiled Odio as an unreliable witness and one who has a histrionic personality disorder. Posner, a defender of the Warren Report, discredited Odio's character by revealing portions of her psychiatric history and accounts of what her friends told him. Specifically, Posner mentioned Odio's hysterical fainting spells and that she is a divorcee who left a fractious marriage.Assassination in Camelot: The Complete History of the Assassination of John F. Kennedy, Jerome A. Kroth, Algora Publishing, 2003, 309. Odio's psychiatrist, Dr. Burton Einspruch, told the House Select Committee \\"Let me say, consciously, I don‚Äôt think she would want to lie, but to me, it‚Äôs very conceivable that in the histrionic personality, the kind of personality that she had that where she would not lie, she could be ‚Äî has a degree of suggestibility that she could believe something that did not really transpire.\\" Notes References Category:1937 births Category:Living people Category:Cuban emigrants to the United States Category:People from Dallas Category:People associated with the assassination of John F.

Camp history The camp comprised two buildings located in the town. The main camp was located on Naundorfer Strasse, about south-west of the railway station. Originally a small print factory it was requisitioned for use as a POW camp in May 1941. For most of the war the camp held only around 800 POWs, as most were assigned to Arbeitslager (\\"Work Camps\\") in factories, mines, railway yards, and farms, up to away. There was also an administration building on the corner of Wolfersdorff and Puschkin Strassen, formerly a school for Army NCOs, with a small compound of wooden huts that housed around 20 POWs assigned to clerical duties. A sub-camp, Stalag IV-D/Z, was opened in May 1942, located in Annaburg about north of Torgau. From March 1944 it was designated as a Heilag (short for Heimkehrerlager), a repatriation camp for POWs waiting to be either exchanged or returned home on medical grounds. The camps were liberated in late April 1945 when US and Soviet forces met on the Elbe at Torgau.  Post‚ÄìWorld War II  After the war, the Soviet secret police agency NKVD established its Special Camps Nos. 8 and 10 in Fort Zinna and in the nearby Seydlitz barracks. Germans and some Soviet citizens were interned here or served sentences passed by the Soviet military tribunals. The East German People's Police used the Fort Zinna prison from 1950 to 1990 as a penitentiary. In the 1950s it primarily housed political prisoners.

CRC press, 2006.Rong and Fa, Grandiose Survey of Chinese Alcoholic Drinks and Beverages, 2013, Jiuqu consists of a complex mixture of various molds, yeasts, and bacteria with their associated metabolites, cultured on a starch-rich substrate in a solid state fermentation process. They are typically stored and sold in the form of dried bricks (Daqu, Â§ßÊõ≤), balls (Xiaoqu, Â∞èÊõ≤ e.g. Shanghai Yeast Balls), powders or as dried grains (Red Yeast Rice, Á∫¢Êõ≤Á±≥). The most common organisms found in Jiuqu are the filamentous molds Aspergillus oryzae and Rhizopus oryzae and the amylolytic yeast Saccharomycopsis fibuligera. Amylolytic and proteolytic enzymes are the most abundant metabolites isolated.Zheng, Xiao‚ÄêWei, et al. \\"Daqu‚ÄîA traditional Chinese liquor fermentation starter.\\" Journal of the Institute of Brewing 117.1 (2011): 82‚Äì90. Although the art of making Jiuqu is a traditional practice of the Chinese that can be traced as far back as the Shang dynasty (17th to 11th century BC),Shurtleff, William, and Akiko Aoyagi.

Soyinfo Center, 2012. it can now be technically classified as a type of biomolecule manufacturing process. Jiuqu preparation serves two parallel functions, the growth of the microbial species and their generation of enzyme metabolites. Both are dried gradually on the substrate, ensuring their viability for anticipated reactivation when the Jiuqu is added to a new source of water and nutrition. Jiuqu is therefore a source of both microbes and enzymes. The addition of Jiuqu to a cereal or pulse-based solution initiates the breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids into CO2, ethanol, organic acids and various other metabolites. This complex process of simultaneous catabolism and fermentation, often termed parallel or mash fermentation, is at variance with the beer and wine processes typical of the western world.Xiaoqing Mu et al Solid-State Fermented Alcoholic Beverages, in Chen, Jian, and Yang Zhu, eds. Solid State Fermentation for Foods and Beverages. CRC Press, 2013. The traditional practice of the production of Jiuqu was often empirical and took place in homes, villages or small-scale manufacturing facilities, lacking the level of consistency or quality required by modern consumers.Lv, Xu-Cong, et al. \\"Yeast diversity of traditional alcohol fermentation starters for Hong Qu glutinous rice wine brewing, revealed by culture-dependent and culture- independent methods.\\" Food Control 34.1 (2013): 183‚Äì190, pp1-2Zheng, Xiao-Wei, et al. \\"Complex microbiota of a Chinese \\" Fen\\" liquor fermentation starter ( Fen- Daqu), revealed by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.\\" Food microbiology 31.2 (2012): 293‚Äì300, pp 1 In modern times, in an effort to refine the process and drawing upon the experience of koji manufacture development in Japan which is highly industrialized with the use of isolated monocultures, large Jiuqu companies have taken advantage of laboratory methods utilizing selected pure cultures of each organism as individual starters. Selected microorganisms isolated from traditional Jiuqu practices now find widespread application in the Chinese biotechnology industry to manufacture such things as enzymes, organic acids, ethanol, polysaccharides, amino acids and vitamins.Steinkraus, Keith, ed.

History Jiuqu is also known variably across China as \\"starter cake\\" (), \\"liquor medicine\\" () or more simply known as Qu (Êõ≤/È∫π approximate English pronunciation Chew). Classified among the multitude of starter cultures used for traditional cereal or pulse-based fermentations worldwide, Jiuqu in a modern context refers explicitly to types of microbes and their enzymes (Qu Êõ≤/È∫π) domesticated for usage in the manufacture of products containing alcohol (Jiu ÈÖí). In various other East, South and Southeast Asian nations Qu can be known as; Koji in Japan, Nuruk in Korea, Murcha/Marcha in India and Nepal, Banh Men in Vietnam, Paeng in Laos, Loog Pang in Thailand, Mochi kouji in Myanmar, Mae Domba in Cambodia, Ragi in Indonesia and Malaysia and Bubod in the Philippines.Tamang, Diversity of Fermented Beverages and Alcoholic Drinks in Tamang & Kailasapathy eds Fermented Foods and Beverages of the World, CRC press, (2010) The process of creating Qu for use in fermentation is believed to have originated in China some 3000‚Äì4000 years ago and has been introduced throughout the rest of East Asia, and into Southeast Asia and South Asia. Jiuqu is directly referenced in the Shangshu, one of the five ancient Confucian writings. In a chapter of the book from the Shang dynasty (17th to 11th century BC) it is recorded \\"to make wine or sweet liquor one needs Qu Nieh\\". Although the precise translation of the text is debatable, most authorities concur that Qu describes a preparation of ferments, whilst Nieh refers to sprouted grain. They may have formed separate elements of liquor production (both Qu and Nieh) or possibly might refer to a single preparation made of fermenting sprouted grains (Qunieh). The Shangsu is considered to predate 500 BC, thus the ancient predecessor of Jiuqu may be the world's oldest recorded example of biotechnological manufacturing using a domesticated microbial community. Qu is also mentioned in the Zhouli (circa 150 BC), a collection of texts from the Eastern Zhou dynasty, where it is described for usage in preparing fermented meat and a type of grain-meat paste (Jujiang). At the Mawangdui (200 BC to 10 AD), bamboo strips found in Han Tomb Number 1 document an inventory of tomb furnishings and list two sacks of Qu as part of the tombs contents. The Liji (100 AD), a collection of texts from the Eastern Han dynasty, mentions Qu as one of the six requisites to make good wine. Another almanac from the Eastern Han dynasty, the Shuowen Jiezi (121 AD), records a character for Qu modified to include the yellow Chrysanthemum flower. This has been interpreted as referring to the distinctive yellow colour formed on Qu by sporulating molds. The Shiming (151 AD) goes further to indicate several types of Qu, which are interpreted as being distinguished by the source of the starch and the form of the substrate. Importantly it reveals that since the Han dynasty Qu was being produced in China from mostly wheat or barley and being pressed into cakes or bricks for handling. The earliest reference to actual preparation of Qu appears in the Qimin Yaoshu (, 544 AD) of the Northern Wei dynasty. Here the techniques employed for making 9 separate kinds of Qu Nieh are described in detail, as are their usage in the manufacture of 37 different wines. The usage of Qu in making vinegar, soy pastes and soy sauces is also documented. With the release of the Qing Yilu (, 965 AD), the use of a special Hongqu (Red starter) is recorded for the first time. The (c. 304) Nanfang Caomu Zhuang has the earliest description of preparing a natural \\"herb ferment\\" (c«éoq≈´ ËçâÈ∫¥) with rice, used to make a special wine for marriage ceremonies.Joseph Needham and Huang Hsing-Tsung (2000), Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 6 Biology and Biological Technology, Part 5: Fermentations and Food Science, Cambridge University Press, p. 183. \\"In [Nanhai, in Guangzhou] there are many fine wines, prepared not with yeast leaven but by pounding rice flour mixed with many kinds of herb leaves and soaked in the juice of [Yƒõg√©] ÂÜ∂Ëëõ. The dough, as big as an egg, is left in dense bushes under the shade. After a month, it is done, and is used to mix with glutinous rice to make wine. Thus if drunk heavily, even after awakening from intoxication, the head is hot and sweaty because there are poisonous herbs in it.\\"Tr. Li Hui-Lin (1979), Nan-fang ts'ao-mu chuang: a fourth century flora of Southeast Asia, The Chinese University Press, p. 59. Yege is Gelsemium elegans or Heartbreak grass, the roots of which are poisonous. Jiuqu production Making Jiuqu involves a technique of cultivating microbes on starchy materials and is an entirely separate process that precedes the actual fermentation of grains and pulses into food or alcoholic beverages. Traditional practices vary from region to region and diverge from the ideal process now utilized to produce more modern, industrialized Jiuqu. The major principles in manufacturing Jiuqu are: :a) the preparation of cereal grains (mostly rice) or a dough made from cereal grains (wheat, barley, rice and peas) :b) inoculation with previously grown microbiota (generally 4‚Äì8% weight) :c) incubation in a warm, humid environment for a set time period to stimulate growth and metabolism of microbiota :d) subsequent drying to preserve the functional properties They can be sold fresh or stored without significant loss of viability for up to 3 years. The ingredients of the substrate used for Jiuqu vary across China in accordance with regional preferences, availability and the type of Qu ultimately being produced. The most common flours used in Daqu are wheat and barley/peas. The preparation of Hongqu involves only whole rice grains. Herbs of many kinds are also variously included into the rice doughs of many Xiaoqu preparations. Traditional methods of preparing Qu have changed little since the publication of the Qimin Yaoshu (544 AD). Grains or flours are imbibed with water (e.g. steaming rice or mixing flour with water to form a dough) and subsequently incubated in a warm, humid environment during a favourable time of year, typically spring or autumn. No inoculums were used, but often herbs were added to some preparations because they were noted to create beneficial qualities. In order to keep the grains or doughs relatively moist and warm they are kept in closed straw-roofed huts and typically housed in straw baskets, stacked on wooden shelves or simply placed upon the floor. Leaves of various plants, often straw, mulberry leaves or Artemisia, were used to wrap or cover the Qu to promote a beneficial condition. The presses and moulds used to shape the doughs were/are also made of wood. All of these elements unknowingly provided access to the microbes. The cakes are deemed ready when a coloured coating is formed on the outside. They are then dried and stored until use. The control of moisture and temperature levels and a lack of atmospheric access was recognized as vital to making consistently good Jiuqu as early as the Qimin Yaoshu. One aspect that has changed is the method of re-culturing for a subsequent preparation. Traditionally microbes indigenous to the raw material, the process and the locale simply grew upon the grains or doughs. At some stage in history it was discovered that using small amounts (2‚Äì8% weight) of a previous successful batch to inoculate the current one gave more consistent results. The starter cultures are often handed down from generation to generation in a continuous cycle of serial re-culturing. The most important functional organisms in Jiuqu have been recognized as the filamentous molds Aspergillus and Rhizopus, which only reproduce asexually through spores called conidia. So an important step in manufacturing is to allow some of the cultured substrate to mature and sporulate in order to reinoculate the next batch. Most of the other microbes present are capable of vegetative budding (yeasts) or binary fission (bacteria) and are capable of propagating themselves without any trouble. The incubation and maturation phase of making Jiuqu is a typical biomolecule manufacturing process using solid state fermentation. Yeasts and bacteria are often used in industrial submerged fermentations because they thrive at high water activity and reduced oxygen levels. Molds, however, prefer the lower water content and increased oxygen found in solid-state fermentations. The steaming of grains or making of doughs for Jiuqu creates a solid substrate with reduced water activity. Thus, the actual Jiuqu technique passed down through history unknowingly favoured the growth and reproduction of the mold genera, organisms capable of excreting large amounts of functional enzymes onto their substrate. The Jiuqu itself became a dried product carrying both microbes and their enzymes (the biomolecules). Most yeast and bacteria do not find the conditions of Jiuqu optimal but still grow effectively in solid state fermentations and their relationships to Jiuqu have been understudied.Lv, Xu-Cong, et al. \\"Microbial diversity of traditional fermentation starters for Hong Qu glutinous rice wine as determined by PCR-mediated DGGE.\\" Food control 28.2 (2012): 426‚Äì434. Jiuqu processing can be carried out synchronously in the factory or workplace that produces the fermented end-product (such as a brewery or soy sauce factory) or it can be produced independently for sale to an establishment for a specific use. Traditionally the brewery was not responsible for making Jiuqu but now often they specialize in the preparation. Jiuqu manufacturing techniques still vary widely, with each brewery or factory using a slightly different process and locally indigenous microflora, which in turn has generated a large biodiversity in Jiuqu across China. The process of making industrialized Jiuqu is now inherently more complex as there are two end products sought to be manufactured by the factory, Jiuqu for use in alcohol production and so called 'seed' Jiuqu for continued culturing of the microbiota. Seed jiuqu is a pre- production process tailored to suit the growth and subsequent reproductive cycle of select microbes. As such, Jiuqu practices have evolved from: 1) no- inoculum, spontaneous growth of microbiota from the natural surroundings through to 2) inoculation with a previous batch to improve consistency, culminating in 3) 20th century industrial culturing of the microbiota in a special pre-production process. A fourth step was introduced in 21st century China, where totally aseptic laboratory conditions are used to mono-culture specific favourable strains of mold, yeast and bacteria grown on independent, fortified substrates. Such isolates now find usage in biotechnology applications such as fuel ethanol or enzyme production.Meussen, Bas J., et al. \\"Metabolic engineering of Rhizopus oryzae for the production of platform chemicals.\\" Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology 94.4 (2012): 875‚Äì886. An important objective in Chinese industry is the continued research into biotechnological domestication of such microbes and as such, standardization of Jiuqu preparation is being achieved. Functions The advantage of using q≈´ for alcohol production, lies in its two-fold effect. The enzymes and microorganisms in q≈´ at the same time break down the starches and sugars, reducing the process of making grain spirits to basically one step. The utilization of microbial-cultured starches to generate a fermentation has a long history in East Asian countries, as seen by the diversity of foods and beverages produced. Brewing alcoholic beverages from grains typically involves the use of sprouted cereal grains that supply natural enzymes to break down carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. The ensuing liquid obtained is fermented by microbes and turned into an alcoholic drink. As the grains used for traditional East Asian alcoholic fermentations are raw and unsprouted (read unmalted), the enzymes responsible for the conversion of carbohydrates to fermentable sugars are absent and thus fermentation cannot proceed. Culturing microbes on cereal grains is a time-honoured tradition from East Asia and the necessary way around this dilemma, as they exude the enzymes that allow liquefaction and saccharification to occur (up to fifty different enzymes have been isolated from Aspergillus oryzae starters). Their mutualistic symbiosis with fermentative yeast and bacteria initiates the complex saccharification- liquefaction-fermentation process to produce the sought after alcoholic liquid.Zheng et al. Fermentation Biotechnology of Traditional Foods In China, in Pometto et al., ed. Food Biotechnology, Second Edition. CRC press, 2005. Jiuqu is ground and applied directly in the form of a dry powder to cooked grain at a predefined temperature suitable for the growth of the microbes. Any enzymes present in the jiuqu are rehydrated and mobilized but in most applications only a small amount of jiuqu is used (2‚Äì8%) that precludes any major enzyme input from the starter. As such, jiuqu is only utilized to inoculate the mash with microbes. In the case of Baijiu production, typical amounts of 15‚Äì25% Jiuqu are used, sometimes as high as 50%, which consequently provides a major enzyme contribution to the mash to initiate catabolism. The exponential growth and reproduction of microbes after inoculation releases more enzymes in the process, inducing further catabolism of the substrate, to produce poly- and mono-saccharides, amino acids, peptides, CO2, alcohol and organic acids. Although only one type of starter is required, many Chinese breweries use two of more types of starters for added complexity in flavour. Modern Chinese brewing has also adopted many practices to optimize production and a 'seed mash' is now commonly prepared where the Jiuqu is added, often along with yeast (ÈÖµÊØç Jiao Mu or Chiao Mu or simply Jiao/Chiao ÈÖµ), to a small amount of the substrate. After incubation for 2‚Äì7 days the seed mash is then added to the bulk of fermentables. Microbiota of Jiuqu The geographical environment exerts a significant influence on the microbiology of Jiuqu. Certain species and genera prefer different climatic conditions and domestication in the Jiuqu making process has favoured the development of regional microbiota assemblages across China. By comparison, the industrial Japanese Koji making process favours only one monoculture species, Aspergillus oryzae. One difficult aspect in identifying the species present in Jiuqu appears to be bias introduced by the analytical technique used, i.e. culture dependent or DNA extraction methods often miss entire species or misrepresent their statistical importance. Studies published so far have failed to establish any pattern in Jiuqu microbiology across China reflecting the large amount of regional diversity.Shang, Yue‚ÄêLing, et al. \\"A comparative study on the fungal communities of wheat Qu for Qingshuang‚Äêtype Chinese rice wine.\\" Journal of the Institute of Brewing 118.2 (2012): 243‚Äì248. Molds Molds are the most prevalent organisms found in Jiuqu and are considered to be the dominant enzymatic agents responsible for liberating glucose and other fermentable sugars from the source of carbohydrates used (along with the yeast Saccharomycopsis fibuligera). Molds found in traditional Chinese fermentation starters include Aspergillus, Rhizopus, Amylomyces, Monascus, Absidia, Rhizomucor and Mucor. Species of Rhizopus are capable of producing fumaric acid, lactic acid and ethanol as they excrete zymases, but their production capabilities vary widely from strain to strain.

The species of mold present appears to be an important factor in determining the type of Jiuqu being produced and its intended use. In turn, the dominant mold species is highly dependent on the climate, substrate and production techniques that vary across the provinces of China. Both substrate and incubation phases can be adjusted to favour the growth of certain species of molds, e.g. Rhizopus and Mucor prefer higher water activities and temperatures to Aspergillus, whilst Mucor and Actinomucor prefer substrates richer in protein. In some reported examples of Jiuqu microbiology, potentially harmful strains of mold were encountered such as Aspergillus flavus and Rhizopus microsporus, but it is uncertain if they were identified correctly or if the strains encountered were in fact capable of toxin production.Lv, Xu-Cong, et al. \\"Identification and characterization of filamentous fungi isolated from fermentation starters for Hong Qu glutinous rice wine brewing.\\" The Journal of general and applied microbiology 58.1 (2011): 33‚Äì42. Yeast Yeast species form part of the symbiotic nature of a Jiuqu starter and can be enzymatic (substrate-degrading) and/or fermentative. Yeast genera observed for Jiuqu in decreasing order of significance include Saccharomycopsis, Issatchenkia, Saccharomyces, Pichia, Candida and Rhodotorula. The yeast species most frequently reported for Jiuqu starters is Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, as is typical for traditional East Asian fermentation starters. A close relative, Issatchenkia orientalis, is also reported frequently and together they appear to be co-involved in starch breakdown with the mold genera. Both species have limited but capable (3‚Äì5% alcohol) fermentative capacities. Pichia anomala is almost ubiquitous and although incapable of elevated alcohol production, it appears to be vital in developing taste and aroma. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the most common highly fermentative yeast present in Jiuqu.Chen, Mao-bin, et al. \\"Analysis of microorganisms and physicochemical properties in Zaopei during the fermentation of Chinese zhijiang-flavor liquor.\\" African Journal of Biotechnology 9.25 (2010): 3874‚Äì3882.Wu, Q., Y.

Bacteria Bacterial species are present in large numbers in Jiuqu and are also partly responsible for the successful breakdown of proteins and carbohydrates and the conversion of fermentable sugars into organic acids. Lactic acid is the most common organic acid found in Chinese alcoholic beverages and plays a vital role in both the organoleptic qualities, as well as acting as a naturally occurring preservative. The bacterial species most commonly found in decreasing significance include Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Streptomyces, Acetobacter and Clostridium. Of these genera Bacillus species are the dominant bacterial genera in Jiuqu. Bacillus species are known to be large producers of enzymes and therefore also contribute to the overall breakdown of the cereal grains.ZHAO, Wen-jing, et al. \\"Isolation and Preliminary Identification of Bacteria from Distiller's Yeast of Buzi Wine in Hougou, Yuci.\\" Hubei Agricultural Sciences 20 (2012): 048.Yan, Zheng, et al. \\"Effect of different Bacillus strains on the profile of organic acids in a liquid culture of Daqu.\\" Journal of the Institute of Brewing 119.1‚Äì2 (2013): 78‚Äì83.Liu, Chen-jian, et al. \\"Natural populations of lactic acid bacteria in douchi from Yunnan Province, China.\\" Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE B 13.4 (2012): 298‚Äì306. Types An exponential variety of Jiuqu can be produced by manipulating the ingredients and process across the different ecological environments of China. Some types are produced by exploiting natural temperature shifts, others by purely mechanical temperature adjustments. Some Jiuqu are still wrapped in straw and sun dried, whilst others are wrapped in straw and hung from the rafters to dry in the wind. Although Jiuqu will contain its own distinctive, region-specific mix of microorganisms, the temperature schemes involved in preparation directly manipulate the microbial ecology, e.g. Aspergillus oryzae and species of Actinomucor and Mucor prefer lower temperatures than Rhizopus oryzae. In turn the starch ingredients used also alter the microbial ecology dictating both the type and amount of metabolites present, e.g. Aspergillus oryzae and Rhizopus oryzae both produce more starch degrading enzymes and are found commonly on 100% flour substrates, whilst Actinomucor and Mucor produce more proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes and are more abundant when pulse flours are added. The several types of Jiuqu can be used specifically or in conjunction with one another for the production of Chinese alcoholic drinks. Huangjiu or cereal wines, can incorporate one or several of the starters with the combined used of Xiaoqu and Daqu being most common. In contrast, Baijiu, a distilled beverage, generally uses only Daqu. Xiaoqu Xiaoqu or \\"small starter\\" () are generally small (10‚Äì100 g) cubes or flattened or rounded balls made of rice dough incubated for only a short period of time, usually only several days. Rice flour or rice bran and inoculum are used, with bentonite clay as a bulking agent. Traditionally various herbs (1‚Äì15 varieties) are incorporated into the preparation as either Yaoqu (herb Xiaoqu) or Baiqu (white or herb- less Xiaoqu). They are commonly referred to as Chinese or Shanghai yeast balls when available through western Chinese suppliers. Used mostly for the production of huangjiu and jiuniang and most popular in the southern provinces of China, Xiaoqu is added only to inoculate a fermentation and constitutes very little of the substrate in producing cereal wines (typically 3‚Äì8%). As such, Xiaoqu contributes very minor flavour, aroma or enzymatic function when compared to Daqu. Xiaoqu are the Chinese equivalent of what most other East, South and Southeast Asian countries utilize as a fermentation starter, e.g. Banh Men, Bubod, Murcha, Ragi, Nuruk. Incubation is relatively simple and done at ambient temperatures of 25‚Äì35 ¬∞C for 4‚Äì5 days, before being transferred to a drying room or left out in the sun. Xiaoqu are almost always white because Rhizopus oryzae is the dominant mold species and saccharifying agent. Some types of Xiaoqu are now prepared by mixing yeast sediment with the normal inoculum to produce a more fermentative starter. Daqu Daqu or \\"large starter\\" () are large (1‚Äì5 kg), cakes or bricks of dough that have been incubated for a long period, typically 3‚Äì4 or 6‚Äì8 weeks, and matured for an extended period of up to six months or more. They are rarely available outside of China. Wheat flour is the main ingredient of choice in making Daqu, but some specific types call for the use of barley-wheat and barley-pea flour. The four most famous baijiu of China, Maotai, Fenjiu, Luzhou Laojiao and Xifeng jiu, are all made with Daqu only. Some huangjiu are often started with Xiaoqu and finished with Daqu. Daqu can come in three colours that mostly reflect the dominant mold species present: grey-white (Rhizopus oryzae and/or R. chinensis ), yellow to yellow-green (Aspergillus oryzae) and black (Aspergillus niger and/or A. luchuensis). Both the larger size and the longer incubation ensures higher enzyme and microbial load than Xiaoqu. They are the only starter used for most Baiju liquor fermentations due to their greater starch degrading capacity, i.e. they contribute a high amount of enzymes. The greater degree of microbial metabolism because of a longer, higher temperature conversion phase of incubation is also said to provide certain organoleptic qualities that would be otherwise unachievable in the final distilled liquor. This also directly relates to the greater use of Daqu as an ingredient in making Baiijou rather than simply as an inoculant. Daqu typically constitutes 15‚Äì25% of the overall fermentables, whereas Xiaoqu is used only to inoculate a fermentation (3‚Äì8%). The heavy use (50%) of large 5 kg bricks of Daqu incubated at high temperatures is inherently responsible for the pungent aroma and umami-like flavour of Maotai. Daqu is the most complex process of Jiuqu preparation and has undergone the most modernization. It involves the manipulation of specific time-temperature control schemes in order to achieve slightly different types of Qu, which in turn are used to generate several types of liquor. The four baijiu aromas most typical of China are considered to be sauce-aroma (e.g. Maotai), strong-aroma (e.g. Luzhou Laojiao), mixed-aroma (e.g. Xifeng jiu) and light-aroma (e.g. Fenjiu). Daqu preparation is manipulated in order to help produce these different aromas. Daqu can be generally categorized into three kinds according to the highest temperature achieved during incubation: high- temperature Daqu (60‚Äì70 ¬∞C), medium-temperature Daqu (50‚Äì60 ¬∞C) and low- temperature Daqu (40‚Äì50 ¬∞C) respectively. As an example of the differing usages schemes, Maotai uses high-temp Daqu and Luzhou Laojiao uses medium-temp Daqu and both are made from wheat flour. Fenjiu and Xifeng jiu use low-temp Daqu made from barley and pea flour but differ in coarseness of the crushed grains (Fenjiu coarse, Xifeng jiu small). High- and medium-temp Daqu generally undergo a four-step process: # a low-temperature (30‚Äì40 ¬∞C) incubation phase for 3‚Äì5 days to stimulate initial growth of microbes, # a higher temperature (50‚Äì70 ¬∞C) conversion phase for 3‚Äì5 days to increase the metabolic activities of the microbes, # a curing phase (45 ¬∞C) for 9‚Äì12 days to create flavours and dehydrate the cake and # maturation for up to six months or more at ambient temperatures. Low-temp Daqu typically undergo a more complex six-step process: 1) a low temperature (35‚Äì40 ¬∞C) incubation phase for 2‚Äì4 days, 2) a cooling phase (25‚Äì35 ¬∞C) for 3‚Äì5 days to stabilize growth of microbes, 3) a heating phase (40‚Äì50 ¬∞C) for 4‚Äì5 days to increase metabolic activities, 4) a curing phase (45 ¬∞C) for 7‚Äì8 days to create flavour and further dehydrate the cake, 5) an equilibration phase (< 35 ¬∞C) for 4‚Äì5 days to cool the cakes and 6) maturation for up to 6 months or more at ambient temperatures. The scientific basis for the different processes which lead to different varieties of Daqu and their impact needs to be further clarified, as standardization of production methods is a leading goal of the Chinese alcohol industry. Hongqu Red Yeast Rice (Hongqu), a dried culture of Monascus purpureus A bag of Red Yeast Rice (Hongqu) Hongqu or \\"red starter\\" (), also called angkak in Hokkien, is rice that had been cultured primarily with Monascus purpureus or other red rice molds of the genus Monascus, available as dried, mold- encrusted rice with a unique red colour, and sold as Red Yeast Rice (Á∫¢Êõ≤Á±≥/Á∫¢È∫πÁ±≥). Used mostly for huangjiu and cu (vinegar) this starter gives the beverage a unique red or purple colour due to the pigments that are produced by members of Monascus. Two very popular varieties of starter ferments are Wuyi Hongqu that involves culturing Monascus with a black mold (Aspergillus niger and/or A. luchuensis) to make the rice black outside/red inside and Huangyi Hongqu that involves Monascus with a yellow mold (Aspergillus oryzae or A. flavus) to make the rice yellow outside/red inside.Xu and Zhang, Solid-State Fermented Condiments and Pigments, in Chen, Jian, and Yang Zhu, eds. Solid State Fermentation for Foods and Beverages. CRC Press, 2013. Hongqu is prepared in a very similar way to Japanese koji: rice is steamed, cooled and then mixed with the inoculum (1‚Äì2%). It is then transferred to an incubation room where the temperature is maintained at 35‚Äì40 ¬∞C for 4‚Äì5 days and the rice is stirred frequently. A modern practice is to steep the rice in weak acetic acid solution for a short period to help create the optimum pH of 3‚Äì3.5 that favours Monascus growth. Afterward incubation the rice is removed and dried. Often in the production of Hongqu rice wine, both Hongqu and Xiaoqu are utilized. Studies have revealed that Monascus species show strong gluco- amylase activity, but poor proteolytic and lipolytic enzyme production. Also the fermentative yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was mostly absent from Hongqu starters but present in Xiaoqu. Thus Hongqu is used only to provide red pigmentation and saccharification and as such, they should generally be used in conjunction with another starter with high fermentative capability. Minor varieties The following form the category Maiqu (È∫¶Êõ≤, wheat qu), used as a major component (15‚Äì25%) of the total starter for some huangjiu. The manufacturing process and microbiota are similar to Daqu but it is made entirely from wheat. *Shenqu (Á•ûÊõ≤): Made of raw, roasted and steamed wheat *Fuqu (È∫∏Êõ≤): Wheat bran *Shumaiqu (ÁÜüÈ∫¶Êõ≤): Steamed wheat *Benqu (Á¨®Êõ≤): Roasted wheat *Sengmaiqu (ÁîüÈ∫¶Êõ≤): Raw wheat See also *Aspergillus oryzae (koji) *Baijiu *Huangjiu *Nuruk *Chinese wine References Category:Chinese alcoholic drinks Category:Rice wine ","title":"Q≈´"},{"id":"33977584","title":"Tamakairiki Tsuyoshi"},{"id":"33977586","text":"right Lamps of Fire - the Spirit of Religions is an anthology of religious writings compiled, and often translated, by Juan Mascar√≥. Synopsis After a preface by Mascar√≥, the book is divided into four sections each filled with numbered selections. The first section, The Spirit of Religions, contains selections from the scriptures of each of the major world religions: Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Jainism, Taoism, Confucianism, Shintoism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Sikhism. The other three chapters are based around the themes of Light, Love and Life. In all there are 300 selections, each given a title. After the scriptures in the first chapter, the selections in the subsequent chapters broaden to include writings by mystics and poets. The Bible and the Tao De Ching are the two scriptures most fully represented, while the saint most frequently quoted is St John of the Cross. Composition and publication Mascar√≥ explains his selections in a preface where he maintains that all the passages are lamps of fire that all merge into what John of the Cross called \\"the lamp of the being of God\\" (a passage from the Spanish saint's poem The Living Flame of Love and the 108th selection in the book). The book, he writes, contains words of vision and faith which can become \\"a light in deep darkness and a refuge in the storm\\".Mascar√≥, Juan (1958) Lamps of Fire, pp. 9‚Äì11, Methuen & Co Ltd Many of the passages are translated or rendered by the author. Mascar√≥'s obituary in The Times explained that a collection of mystical poetry was entirely natural product from one who \\"believed that the poetic and the spiritual were one; that religious truth could only be expressed through poetry.\\"Juan Mascar√≥ obituary, The Times, 24 March 1987. The first edition of Lamps of Fire was limited to 200 copies in 1958 retailing at 4 guineas. In 1961 Methuen & Co. Ltd. published a cheaper version at 21 shillings. There was a reprint of the book in 1972 and a later edition was published in Mascaro's native Catalan shortly before his death in 1986.Letter from Gregori Mir in Ultima Hora newspaper reproduced in Mascar√≥, Juan (1999) The Creation of Faith, Bayeux Arts, p. 187 Reception The Times Literary Supplement gave the book a positive review. The review commented on the combination of art and scholarship in Mascar√≥'s translations and the depth of spiritual insight that ensured every passage would enrich readers' understanding. The reviewer also commended Mascar√≥ on the range of his selections across history and geography and the inclusion of lesser known names.Fausset, Hugh I'Anson (1959). \\"Gold Mine\\". The Times Literary Supplement p. 168, Issue 2977. Lamps of Fire and George Harrison The 48th selection, entitled \\"The Inner Light\\", was used by George Harrison as the lyrics for a song by The Beatles of the same name. Mascar√≥ had sent George Harrison a copy of the book in mid-November 1967 in response to a letter from Harrison. Mascar√≥'s accompanying letter explained that he had recently been introduced to The Beatles song \\"Within You Without You\\" by friends and had been moved by the song's message. In a post script, Mascar√≥ wonders if it \\"might not be interesting to put into your music a few words of Tao\\" before suggesting selection 48 from his book (rendered by Mascar√≥).Harrison, George (1980). I, Me, Mine. p.118, New York: Simon & Schuster. . Harrison travelled to Bombay, India in January 1968 to record Indian musicians for the soundtrack of a film, Wonderwall. During these sessions he also set Mascar√≥'s suggested passage to music. After some additional work in London the following month, the song was released as a B-side to the single \\"Lady Madonna\\" on 15 March 1968. Mascar√≥ had first met Harrison on 4 October 1967 when they both appeared on The Frost Programme television show. Harrison and John Lennon were brought in to discuss Transcendental Meditation (TM) with a panel of experts that included Mascar√≥, Dr. John Allison, a group of Quakers and the author and lawyer John Mortimer, who took the atheistic side of the debate.

The school was founded in 1898 by the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) and provides instruction at the preschool, primary, and secondary levels. It is a selective school that excels in academics and athletics. Among 2,439 in Peru, it is one of 22 which have received an \\"excellent\\" rating. It has the second largest campus of all the schools in Per√∫, and it is also the second oldest school in town, after Sagrados Corazones. The school currently competes with Prescott School, Lord Byron School, and Max Uhle. History The first Jesuit school in Arequipa was founded in 1578 under the name Colegio de Santiago but was soon closed by Viceroy Francisco de Toledo, who opposed the school. However, Toledo was deposed in 1581 and the school re-opened. It remained in operation until 1767, when Charles III of Spain expelled all Jesuits from Peru. The present school opened in 1898 in the Plaza de Santa Marta. The name \\"Colegio San Jos√©\\" actually resulted from the confusion that followed when a school in Ecuador sent an oil painting to Arequipa as a gift and the packaging referred to the city San Jos√©, where a similar package had headed. The vice-provincial, Fr. Ildefonso del Olmo, S.J., assumed the reference indicated the chosen name of the new school. In 1956 the school moved to its present location on Avenida Alfonso Ugarte. In 1966 a graduate student at Loyola University Chicago did a Master thesis on student values at the school.  Voluntary service  In August 1998 the San Jose Voluntary Group was born, first serving at the Intensive Care Unit of Social Security, now Essalud. and then at Asilo Lira, Honorio Delgado Hospital, and Hogar de Cristo. This grew to 60 regular volunteers formed into 7 groups. By 2014 the volunteers were reaching out to seven different works.

Design and development The Type 525 was a late development of the Type 508 of which three examples had been ordered from Supermarine in November 1947 to Air Ministry specification N.9/47.Sturtivant p. 571 The Type 508s were to be development aircraft for a carrier-borne interceptor, reconnaissance and low-level nuclear strike aircraft to be built later by Supermarine to specification N.113D and which became the Type 544 which entered service as the Scimitar.Thetford, p. 338-339 The first Type 508, serial VX133, was a straight-winged jet aircraft fitted with a V-tail (\\"butterfly\\") tail intended for use with rubber deck landing techniques, the choice of wide, flattish fuselage and V-tail being designed to provide adequate stability and clearance when landing without a normal undercarriage. It first flew on 31 August 1951. The second Type 508 VX136 was fairly similar to the first aircraft but was redesignated as the Type 529 and first flew on 29 August 1952.Thetford p. 338 The third Type 508 VX138, built like the others at Supermarine's Hursley Park experimental department, was modified on the production line to closer to Scimitar standards and was redesignated the Type 525. This aircraft was delivered by road to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE;) at Boscombe Down, Wiltshire, on 25 April 1954. It made its first flight on 27 April 1954 at the hands of Supermarine's test pilot M J Lithgow.Sturtivant, p. 572 The Type 525 was powered by two Rolls-Royce Avon turbojets and fitted with a taller tricycle undercarriage positioned further out on the wings than on the Type 508. It had a conventional tail and rudder surfaces and swept wings. It made its first public appearance at the September 1954 Farnborough Airshow. Operational history Supermarine 525 prototype (VX138) landing aboard the Royal Navy aircraft carrier , 14 June 1955. The aircraft crashed just three weeks later after the pilot was unable to recover from a flat spin. The aircraft made further test flights during late 1954 from its base at Chilbolton airfield, Hampshire. In early 1955 it was taken by road to the Hursley Park factory for the installation of a flap blowing system. This was designed to reduce the safe landing approach speed, an obvious advantage for safe operation from aircraft carriers. It also lowered the speed at which catapult launches would be carried out.Thetford, p. 338 The flap blowing system (\\"super-circulation\\") on the Type 525 used a device to project a thin jet of high pressure air, bled from an engine compressor, through a narrow slot along the wing trailing edge just ahead of the flap hinges. The CoandƒÉ effect then bent the jet of air over the flaps. The improved lift resulted in an 18 mph reduction in approach speed - most useful for carrier-based aircraft.Andrews and Morgan, pp. 298-301 After returning to Chilbolton by road, the aircraft was flown to the A&AEE; on 5 July 1955 for further trials. The aircraft was tested for low speed handling on 5 July. Whilst at , and unable to recover from a flat spin 20 minutes after take-off, the aircraft spun in from two miles south-southeast of Boscombe Down.

Advocacy evaluation, also called public policy advocacy design, monitoring, and evaluation, evaluates the progress or outcomes of advocacy, such as changes in public policy. Advocacy evaluators seek to understand the extent to which advocacy efforts have contributed to the advancement of a goal or policy. They do this in order to learn what works, what does not, and what works better in order to achieve advocacy goals and improve future efforts. Advocacy evaluation is different from policy analysis, which generally looks at the results of the policy, or mainstream program evaluation, which assesses whether programs or direct services have been successful. Advocacy strives to influence a program or policy either directly or indirectly; therefore, the influence is being evaluated, rather than the results of that influence. Goals of advocacy (dependent variables) In order to evaluate something, one must know the goals of the program/activity, in this case - advocacy efforts. Policy advocacy evaluation focuses on the contribution towards achieving policy, and not on the results of that policy. Policy advocacy evaluators look at these dependent variables (many of which interrelate significantly with movement in the policy cycle): Intermediate Goal Examples: * Increased awareness of constituents about the need for policy (Problem Identification -> Agenda Setting) * Change in rate of key-words use by politicians, sometimes starting from 0 (Problem Identification -> Agenda Setting) * Increase in ratio of policy being implemented according to the adopted legislation (Adoption->Implementation) * Developed capacity of advocacy actor or network of actors to conduct advocacy efforts Ultimate Goals * Policy change itself in the desired direction (of the policy cycle). This is the highest level intermediate outcome, and as an inherent best practice, is the goal of most policy advocacy efforts. Policy Advocacy works to move a policy through the policy cycle. Typology of policy advocacy Direct Advocacy (Directly trying to influence policy makers): *Lobbying (also known as direct lobbying) is the act of attempting to influence decisions made by government officials, most often legislators or members of regulatory agencies. Various people or groups, from private-sector individuals or corporations, fellow legislators or government officials, or advocacy groups use lobbying. Indirect Advocacy (Indirectly influencing policymakers by getting their constituents to advocate): *Grassroots lobbying (also known as indirect lobbying) is a form of lobbying that focuses on raising awareness of a particular cause at the local level, with the intention of reaching the legislature and making a difference in the decision-making process. Grassroots lobbying is an approach that separates itself from direct lobbying through the act of asking the public to contact legislators and government officials concerning the issue at hand, as opposed to conveying the message to the legislators directly. *Activism consists of intentional efforts by citizens or citizen groups, towards policymakers, to promote or prevent social, political, economic, or environmental change. Activism can take a wide range of forms including, from writing letters to newspapers or politicians, political campaigning, rallies, street marches, strikes, sit-ins, and hunger strikes. *Astroturfing supports political, organizational, or corporate agendas, and is designed to give the appearance of a \\"grassroots\\" movement. The goal of such campaigns is to disguise the efforts of a political and/or commercial entity as an independent public reaction to some political entity‚Äîa politician, political group, product, service, or event. Distinct challenges of advocacy evaluation * Contribution vs. attribution: Since multiple actors campaign simultaneously for and against any given policy, it is difficult to ascertain attribution. Evaluating contributions is preferred in this case as it allows multiple actors to influence the degree of success. * Long term nature of advocacy: Since many advocacy goals are long term, measuring impact can be a challenge. Instead, outcomes, interim progress, and intermediary goals are the preferred measures of influence. * Shifting strategies: Since the context that advocates work within is ever-changing, advocates adapt their strategies, which creates a difficult environment in which to monitor progress. * Complexity and theories of change: logic models and theories of change for advocacy campaigns are inherently complex; for example: protests+lobbying+media campaigns -> contribution to policy change. These kinds of theories of change have so many layers, nuances, and uncontrollable factors to them that intra and inter organizational agreement is difficult, making strategic planning, and evaluation all the more challenging.

It is the online version of traditional begging or panhanding via the Internet and a way for people to get help with their financial problems through begging online, a practice known as \\"cyberbegging\\" or \\"digital panhandling\\".http://www.fox5sandiego.com/news/kswb-cyber-beg,0,3014.story Begslist allows visitors to post their pleas for help on the website in the hopes to receive donations. PayPal buttons are added to each of the postings for readers to send donations to those asking for help through secured payments and money transfers through the Internet. On October 19, 2010 Begslist.org launched a new website redesignhttp://www.prnewswire.com/news- releases/begslistorg-launches-new-website-redesign-105243553.html that incorporated social media sharing for users of the site. History Begslist.org was founded in 2007 by Rex Camposagrado and was originally started as a blog called begslist.blogspot.com.https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo- way/2009/10/a_new_way_for_homeless_to_seek.html He created the site to help people who wanted to ask for help by getting donations anonymously; avoiding the embarrassment of having to beg in person or for those trying to find another alternative avenue to finding help any way they could. Camposagrado created Begslist after losing his business and he fell on hard times. He never saw himself as the kind of person to beg for help, but decided to seek help online due to his financial crunch. He attempted online begging, but had a bad experience begging online. Some sites charged him money ‚Äî which he says didn't make sense ‚Äî since that's what he needed.https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121211164 Amidst the slew of online begging sites Begslist.org costs nothing for cyber beggars to sign up and post their pleas for donations. The hope is to be found by one of the kind souls who scour the internet looking to give their cash away or receive offers of some kind of assistance. Whilst other sites often charge a hefty sign up fee Begslist.org is still free, as its creator knows what hard times are. Instead of the beggars paying to post, Begslist runs paid advertisements from businesses which include free credit reports, pay day loan lenders and credit repair services that help pay for the operation and hosting fees for the website. Virtually all begging sites include a disclaimer that warns of potential scams. Begslist, for example, tells users to avoid people who offer help but solicit money first; it also cautions against disclosing contact information.http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/latest/lat_704143.shtml?v=1034 Camposagrado attempts to monitor the Web site for scams and warns people to be careful. The funny stories, he said, often get a better response than sad ones.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-12-25/news/0912240575_1_begging- late-mortgage-payments-popular Beginning as a single web site, Begslist.org has since expanded and now also publishes additional begging Web sites such as Cyberbegging.org and Scamslist.com. In addition to cyberbegging and online donations, Begslist.org also offers links to free help and resources to help those in need get back on their feet. Affiliates Begslist.Blogspot.com Begslist was originally a blog called begslist.blogspot.com.http://news.discovery.com/tech/panhandling-hits-the- internet.html It still exists, but instead of pleas for help, it is mostly related to articles about the homeless, charities, resources to get help and donation news. Cyberbegging.org Cyberbegging.org is a charity and online begging news website. Scamslist.com With free access to the Internet from computer terminals in libraries and shelters, homeless and destitute people in crisis do post requests for critical needs. Begslist has hundreds of stories about people trying to escape abusive relationships, climb out of debt, pay their rent, feed their families and care for sick children.

Its specific epithet, lonicera (the Latin term for ‚Äòhoneysuckle‚Äô) refers to its similarity in appearance to the true honeysuckles, genus Lonicera. Description Northern bush honeysuckle is a deciduous shrub, reaching a maximum height between 0.6 and 1.2 metres. This particular species is known for the following characteristics: branches lying close to the ground, fibrous roots, pale yellow flowers, and dry, woody fruit. Northern bush honeysuckle's simple leaves are placed in an opposite arrangement. As the seasons change, so do the leaves' colours: initially green, the leaf gradually deepens to a dark red. The flowers are in full bloom between early July and early August; the woody seeds are fully matured by September in preparation for dispersal. Diervilla lonicera has protogynous flowers (initially female- dominant plant), is well-adapted for pollination, and its stigmas remain receptive after anthesis (fully functioning flower). Habitat Exposed rocky sites, combined with the plant's tolerance for cool climates, dry, or infertile soils are varying characteristics to describe a typical habitat for Diervilla lonicera. It is commonly found in forests dominated by balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana). Unlike some plant species that are restricted to specific light conditions, the northern bush honeysuckle is insensitive to changes in light, allowing for broader ranges of habitat. In addition, it is well-adapted to fire-prone habitats, because it can regenerate quickly from underground stems if destroyed by fire. For example, D.J. Schoen found that Diervilla lonicera was the most abundant shrub over a 50-year span on dry ground areas that were destroyed by fire. Range Northern bush honeysuckle is found widely spread across most of North America. It grows all along the east coast of the continent, from Northern Quebec and Labrador to Georgia and Alabama and reaches as far west as Saskatchewan. Bush honeysuckle was also introduced to parts of Europe sometime in the eighteenth century, but the exact year is unknown. Importance to humans Plants from the honeysuckle family are commonly used for herbal cough medicine. The most common use is as an herbal tea for sore throats, but there are also recipes for a cough syrup derived from the leaves and flowers of the vines mixed with honey. Some of these remedies have been able to rival the results of store- bought medicines. It is unknown whether or not Northern bush honeysuckle is any more effective than any other species of bush honeysuckle. These types of recipes can be found on many online cooking websites, but it is very important to be aware of the dangers involved. Some species of honeysuckle can be poisonous, so it is best to use extreme caution and should not be attempted by anyone who is not an expert in this field. Importance to ecosystems The northern bush honeysuckle is a popular food source for a number of animal species. For example, moose consume the shrub and its fruit as a winter food source, whereas white tailed deer consume the plant in both the summer and winter (although preferred in the late summer). The Diervilla lonicera shrub may also be important for sustaining populations of pollinators. This shrub's long and flexible style and readily accessible flowers (produced in large quantities) are known to draw significant numbers of bumble bees.. Diervilla lonicera is also the only recorded host plant for the recently described hawkmoth Hemaris aethra. Bird species also make use of the shrub. Nests are often constructed from its branches for protection from the elements, and the fruits serve as a readily available food source. Diervilla lonicera may even be responsible for triggering population increases and range expansion among various avian species. Conservation Northern bush honeysuckle is generally abundant and widespread in North America; it is only considered to be threatened in Tennessee and rare in Indiana. Neither Canada, nor any of the other American states, has bush honeysuckle registered on a threatened or endangered list.

He was the United States Ambassador to Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) from 1961 to 1966. He was the first ambassador solely accredited to Upper Volta. Biography Thomas Estes was born on January 23, 1913 in Rumford, Oxford County, Maine.  Early years in Worcester, Massachusetts  At age 16, Estes left Maine, and his childhood sweetheart Ruth Fullerton, to live and work with his aunt and uncle Fanny and Joseph Coombs in Worcester, Massachusetts.

In Washington Estes received word that he had passed his written exams for the Foreign Service, was given his oral exams and passed. Estes was assigned to Ambassador Robert Murphy at the Office of the U.S. Political Advisor to General Eisenhower in the Allied Forces Headquarters (AFHQ), Algiers, Africa. Holbrook \\"Chappy\\" Chapman (from Bangkok) posted there as well. During this time Estes participated in the inspection of POW camps by the Swiss and was designated a \\"Special Naturalization Examiner.\\" The duty of the Examiner was to naturalize Army soldiers that were not American citizens. Naturalization ceremonies took place in many dangerous places ‚Äì such as the Anzio beach head. Dorothy gave birth to a daughter, Elisabeth, in Oran, French Algeria, in April 1944. = 1944 Caserta Italy= A little later it was decided to transfer Allied Force Headquarters from Algiers to Caserta, Italy, a few miles north of Naples and so began a road trip to Italy in the Studebaker.

At a stopover in Rome, Estes was invited to an all- priests luncheon by the American Monsignor whom Estes had met in Algiers. At the luncheon the Monsignor announced that the Pope wanted to meet with Estes the next morning. At the meeting the Pope emphasized his deep affection for the Austrian people. He hoped the U.S. would do everything possible to restore their freedom and peaceful existence. Several months later Estes became eligible for home leave ‚Äì two months back in the US. The family traveled in the Studebaker to Hamburg, driving through Germany. = 1946 Quebec = At the end of this vacation Estes was told that he was to attend the Harvard Business School's three-month Advanced Management Program. In the meantime Estes was assigned to the Consulate in Quebec. The Studebaker had arrived back in the US and the family headed to Quebec. The family, and furnishings from Vienna arrived in Quebec several days later and the family settled into an apartment near the Consulate. Duties in Quebec involved issuing visas and certifying citizenship for young couples coming to Quebec to adopt children via the \\"Le Creche\\" organization. While in Quebec Estes met the former Queen Sophia of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire who was living in a Roman Catholic convent. = 1950 State Department = In 1950 Estes was relocated back to Washington and posted to the State Department to handle assignments of staff to several countries in Europe. During this time Estes began a long road to a college degree by taking classes at American University. In September 1951 Estes' wife gave birth to a son, Stuart, in the Seventh Day Adventist hospital in Silver Springs Maryland. Estes attended the Harvard Business School program. After graduation Estes was posted to Athens, Greece to become the Second Director of the Joint Administrative Service (JAS) supporting the effort of the several agencies that were involved in restoring economic stability to Greece. He traveled to Greece aboard the USS Constitution from New York with his family. The JAS was directly or indirectly supported by AID - an economic and military assistance program designed to block the advance of Communism. Duties in Athens ranged from Personnel to Accounting to Payroll issues. Payroll was changed from Drachma's to checks.

His duties were to reorganize the General Service Office provided logistical support for the Department and its domestic and foreign offices. Tom reorganized the office into two major divisions and an executive staff. Previously the units of the organization had operated semi-autonomously for a long period of time and did not readily take to being part of a centrally directed organization. However over time the reorganization worked and essentially the same broad system of doing business is still in use today. Estes was also instrumental in the design of the new State Department building and proposed that the offices and floors be arranged in a way that reflected the tenants rank within the department. Estes and his wife Dorothy divorced in 1957. In 1958 Estes married Ruth Fullerton in Maine. On January 1, 1957 a time capsule for the State Department was filled with a newspaper, coins and other pertinent documents by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, Deputy Under Secretary Loy Henderson, and Estes.

In addition to the usual variations due to the region in which a fisherman chooses to fish and standard materials used in many regions, several differences are seen in the overall construction of them. Feathers, yarns, and furs are all used, some of the most popular being peacock feathers, chicken down and neck feathers, and black wool. Some flies are even tied with thin copper wire to add extra weight so flies can sink in fast moving mountain waters. These flies are mainly used in the Maenikko Ashio ( „Åæ„Åà„Å´„Å£„ÅìË∂≥Â∞æ) area. Many flies are tied in ‚Äúreverse hackle‚Äù meaning the hackle of the fly fans forward towards the eye of the hook instead of down the hook. In Japanese this is referred to as a ‚ÄúSakasakebari („Åï„Åã„Åï„Åë„Å∞„Çä)‚Äù fly. Some rare flies used in the Okumino Itoshiro („ÅäÁµÑ„ÅÆÊÑèÂõ≥ÁôΩÂ∞æ) area even have down feathers incorporated in their design. These flies are not known to float well, so instead they are mainly used as wet flies for shallow waters. Japanese's flies are mainly tied to represent an insect that is common to an area instead of replicating insects. Americans focus more on details in their flies so the fly is a similar to the real thing as possible. The Japanese instead use materials with colors that could represent a large range of insects. Although this is a large difference between both arts of fly tying, both have been very effective in catching fish. Japanese fly designs are even used to fish many types of trout. Japanese fly tying is also seen as an art and in many ways has been expanded on specifically for the purpose of creating.

Vampire bats have developed a specialized system using infrared-sensitive receptors on their nose-leaf to prey on homeothermic (warm-blooded) vertebrates. Trigeminal nerve fibers that innervate these IR-sensitive receptors may be involved in detection of infrared thermal radiation emitted by their prey. This may aid bats in locating blood-rich areas on their prey. In addition, neuroanatomical and molecular research has suggested possible similarities of IR-sensing mechanisms between vampire bats and IR-sensitive snakes. Infrared sensing in vampire bats has not yet been hypothesized to be image forming, as it was for IR-sensitive snakes. While the literature on IR-sensing in vampire bats is thin, progress continues to be made in this field to identify how vampire bats can sense and use infrared thermal radiation. Vampire bats are the only known mammals whose entire nutrition relies on blood from mammals or birds. In the family Phyllostomidae and the subfamily Desmodontinae, there are three known species of vampire bats: Desmodus rotundus (common vampire bat), Diphylla ecaudata (hairy-legged vampire bat), and Diaemus youngi (white-winged vampire bat). Most of the referenced research on infrared sensing in vampire bats has been done on the common vampire bat because this is the most commonly found species.Mulheisen, M. and R. Anderson. 2001. Animal Diversity Web. \\"Desmodus rotundus.\\" Accessed November 14, 2011 http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Desmodus_rotundus.html. Behavior Vampire bats were not studied in their natural habitats until about 1935. During predation, bats first spend a few minutes in the air circling the target prey, eventually landing on the back or neck crest of the animal, and sometimes the ground. They then proceed to search for a suitable spot to bite, which can take seconds to minutes, and usually will feed on the neck or flank. The same spot may be fed on multiple times by different bats. K√ºrten and Schmidt (1982) were the first to suggest that infrared perception in vampire bats is possibly used in detecting regions of maximal blood flow on targeted prey. Although warm receptors are also found in the facial regions of species such as mice, humans, and dogs, the extreme low-temperature sensitivity of these receptors on vampire bats suggest specialization for sensing infrared. (see section on Physiology). In 1982, K√ºrten and Schmidt performed behavioral studies to examine the ability of vampire bats to detect infrared radiation. Their study showed that when given a choice between a warm and cold object, vampire bats can be trained to choose the infrared emitting signal unit (SU). Two SUs made of a heating element with a copper plate backing were mounted on a wall. For each trial, one SU was warmed while the other was maintained at room temperature. The heating and warming of the SUs were interchanged at random between trials. If bats chose the warm SU correctly, they were rewarded with food through a feeding tube below each SU. In this study, olfactory and visual stimuli were minimized to ascertain that only thermal cues affected behavioral learning. Olfactory cues were eliminated by the full feeding tube attached behind the opening from which the bats received their rewards. Dim lighting minimized visual cues of the two SUs. Anatomy Head of Desmodus rotundus: Indicated is position of nasal pits (*), apical pad (aP) and lateral pad (lP).Nasal structure of Desmodus rotundus: Stars indicate position of nasal pits and red outlines the nose- leaf.The central nose-leaf and a semicircular ring of pads construct the nasal structure of the vampire bat. There are also three depressions known as nasal or leaf pits, located between the nose-leaf and pads. Two lateral pits, one on each side of the nose-leaf, are situated at 45¬∞ angles towards the nose-leaf. The apical pit is slightly raised and directed upward and forward relative to the nose-leaf. The pits are about 1 millimeter wide and 1 millimeter deep, hairless, and glandless. A layer of dense connective-tissue with sparsely distributed blood vessels insulates the nasal structure. Based on structure alone, these pits were first suggested to house IR-receptors. Neuroanatomy K√ºrten and Schmidt (1982) first suggested that the location and orientation of each pit structure provided directional information in infrared radiation detection. From their initial studies, the nasal pits seemed to be ideal for purposes of IR-perception. Later in 1984, K√ºrten and collaborators made electrophysiological recordings from nerve fibers of temperature-sensitive infrared thermoreceptors located on the central nose- leaf and upper lip, but did not find such receptors in the nasal pits (see Physiology). This revoked their earlier hypothesis and established that the infrared-sensitive receptors are located on the central nose-leaf. Sch√§fer and collaborators confirmed this by recording impulses from thermoreceptors on the nose-leaf as well. Kl√ºver-Barrera and Nissl staining of vampire bat brain sections uncovered a unique nucleus located lateral to the descending trigeminal tract (dv). The nucleus is composed of neuropils and medium-sized cells, which is very similar to the nucleus (DLV) in the lateral descending trigeminal system in IR-sensitive snakes. This special nucleus is found in all three species of vampire bats and no other bats, but does not necessarily indicate a direct connection with infrared sensing. More recent studies using in situ hybridization studies have located large diameter neurons in the trigeminal ganglia (TG) that are unique to vampire bats and extremely similar to those found in IR-sensitive snakes. Although the morphological organization of neurons suggests convergent evolution with IR-sensing snakes lineages, it remains unclear what the exact neural pathway is for infrared sensing in vampire bats. Physiology Thermography, a method which produces pictures of the distribution of temperatures on an object, was used to investigate temperature variation across facial structures of the common vampire bat. The nasal structure has a temperature of 9 ¬∞C lower than the rest of the face. The thermal insulation of the nasal structure and maintained temperature difference may possibly prevent interference of self-emitted thermal radiation. Warm receptors located in the nose may then optimally detect outside sources of infrared radiation. Vampire bats are sensitive to power densities (a measure of emitted energy) greater than 50 ¬µW/cm2 at distances between 13 and 16 cm (a power density of 1.8x10‚àí4W/cm2 corresponds to 50 ¬∞C). This was first determined by quantifying the temperature at which vampire bats could not behaviorally distinguish between heat emitting and room temperature SUs. A positive linear relationship exists between the energy-threshold of heat detection and distance from stimuli. Through mathematical calculations, at a distance of 8 cm, vampire bats should be able to detect humans who emit radiation of 80 ¬µW/cm2. Temperature threshold measurements were directly measured by stimulating nerve fibers of thermoreceptors in the nose-leaf and upper lip with a water-circulated brass thermode and recording the impulses/second at every 5 ¬∞C shift in temperature from 10 to 40 ¬∞C. These receptors have a threshold of 28 ¬∞C and a maximum temperature response to 40 ¬∞C, beyond which there was either no firing or an irregular firing pattern. This threshold is 8 ¬∞C lower compared to those of warm receptor in other species of mammals, which implies extreme sensitivity to heat. After stimulation of these receptors, there is a transient increase in impulse activity which quickly decays due to adaptation and thus strengthens temporal acuity. Molecular mechanism of infrared detection A family of TRP (transient receptor potential) channels, including TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid) and TRPA1 (transient receptor potential cation channel A1), is important in thermal and pain detection. TRPV1 channels are activated by capsaicin (a chemical which can be extracted from chili peppers), noxious temperature ranges (>43 ¬∞C), membrane-derived lipids, low pH, and voltage changes.Rosenbaum, Tamara, and Sidney A. Simon. \\"TRPV1 Receptors and Signal Transduction.\\" In TRP Ion Channel Function in Sensory Transduction and Cellular Signaling Cascades, edited by Wolfgang B. Liedtke and Stefan Heller. Boca Ranton: CRC Press, 2007. Available online. Activation of TRPV1 by capsaicin results in calcium and sodium influx, and functionally allows for detection of painful thermal stimuli. TRPV1 may also act as a molecular thermometer in response to temperatures greater than 43 ¬∞C. The result is an inward calcium and sodium current similar to capsaicin-evoked currents. TRPV1 channels may also have voltage-sensitive properties responsible for its activation. Phosphorylation and mutations, especially at the C-terminus (carboxylic acid end of primary amino acid sequence), can alter the threshold temperature of heat-activation. The specific mechanism behind heat-activation of TRPV1 channels has yet to be deciphered. TRPV1-S TRPV1-S (TRPV1 short) is an isoform of the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 and comprises 35-46% of TRPV1 transcripts in the trigeminal ganglia of common vampire bats. Deep sequencing of complementary DNA of these receptor channels shows that this is not true for closely related fruit bats Carollia brevicauda (< 6% TRPV1-S) and other fruit, nectar, or insect feeding bats (Uroderma bilobatum, Sturnira lilium, and Anoura cultrata) (<1% TRPV1-S). TRPA1 channels in pit-bearing snakes, such as the western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), are sensitive to infrared thermal radiation as well. TRPA1 transcripts are mostly found in the TG of IR-sensitive snake linages as was for bats. TRPV1-S isoform results from alternative splicing during post-transcriptional regulation, a variation of the TRPV1 C-terminus due to insertion of 23-base-pair sequence, exon14a, that contains a stop codon. The inserted sequence is flanked by two introns marked with GT/AG donor-acceptor sites that are necessary for U2-dependent splicing. Consequently, incorporation or bypass of exon14a results in the short or long isoforms, respectively. It is suggested that efficient splicing of the exon14a segment necessitates the specialized environment of TG in vampire bats. Compared to the long isoform (threshold ~ 40 ¬∞C), the temperature threshold of channel activation is much lower for TRPV1-S. TRPV1-S channels expressed in HEK293 cells and Xenopus oocytes (cells commonly used for manipulation of expressing certain genes) have a threshold of 30 ¬∞C. This is highly consistent with in vitro studies pertaining to temperature thresholds of IR-sensitive receptors in vampire bats (28 ¬∞C). Activation of TRPV1-S channels in the TG may then suggest a similar mechanism (as seen in IR-sensing snakes) for how infrared sensing may work in vampire bats. Trigeminal nerves which innervate specialized temperature sensitive receptors on the nose-leaf may in turn activate TRPV1-S channels in the TG in response to infrared thermal radiation.

Smithwick worked at the BBC for six years where she was involved with several shows for the teen brand BBC Switch and moved on to write for its in-house teen soap The Cut. For the final year of BBC Switch, Smithwick was a commissioning editor. In 2011 Smithwick moved to Hollyoaks to take on the role as Series Editor and later replaced Gareth Philips as the series producer of the soap opera Hollyoaks. Career Smithwick started her career as the assistant to the Producer on The Honeymooners feature film for Paramount Pictures. Smithwick then moved to the BBC in 2005 where she worked in Entertainment Events and worked on Saturday night entertainment shows including Strictly Come Dancing and How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria. Smithwick then moved on to set up BBC Switch with Geoffrey Goodwin and Andy Parfitt. She continued to work at BBC Switch as a creative producer across drama and comedy. While at the BBC, she worked on the teen soap The Cut as a script supervisor and then as a writer. In May 2011, The producer began working on Channel 4's soap opera Hollyoaks as the acting series editor. Producer replaced Gareth Philips as the series producer. Smithwick's first episode in which she was credited as series producer aired on 26 December 2011. Philips introduced the sixth form students and the uni students into the show and Smithwick continued to keep them at the centre, with the aim of creating a more realistic portrayal of university life through the introduction of these characters and focussing on the friendship groups rather than just on families. Talking about her vision for the show, the producer said: \\"through the stories that we're telling and the way we're telling them, we want the audience to really engage with the characters. It definitely takes time but when that happens, it means you can do things with the characters and the viewers will really care. I find the worst thing is when you watch certain shows and something horrendous happens, but you don't really care or know why you should care. Emotional integrity is one of the key things that I want to drive through\\". One of Smithwick's main storylines, building up for over a year was the teen girl bullying storyline which came to a climax with Esther Bloom attempting suicide. The episode aired and brought in the highest viewing figures for over two years and hit an all-time high on E4. Talking to Radio Times, the producer said she is \\"passionate about the portrayal of women in the media in general and specifically on television that's aimed at a younger audience. I'm determined to be part of the solution and not part of the problem\\". She also explained that she would like to \\"redefine what sexy and glamorous is in Hollyoaks\\" and present teenage girls with \\"an emotional encyclopedia that's relevant to the changes and issues in their lives\\". Smithwick was responsible for the abolition of the Hollyoaks calendar. Smithwick executive produced the fifth series of Hollyoaks Later. During her later time on the soap, the producer produced high-profile storylines such as the Mitzeee v Mercedes feud, Lynsey Nolan's (Karen Hassan) murder, George Smith's (Steven Roberts) struggle with homelessness, Silas' return, Brendan Brady's feud with Walker (Neil Newbon), Ste and Brendan's Dublin reunion, Esther Bloom's bullying and attempted suicide and the \\"Enjoy The Ride \\" wedding/bus crash . The producer was also responsible for the introduction of Dr Browning, Martha Kane, Lacey Kane, Joel Dexter, Phoebe Jackson, Ali Grogan, Maxine Minniver and for bringing back John-Paul McQueen. Smithwick oversaw the storylines for Hollyoaks Later in which Brendan Brady discovers that Neil Newbon is an undercover police officer, determined to do whatever it takes to bring him down. The producer worked with Bryan Kikrwood to produce the bus crash storyline to help the serial in \\"appealing to a wider audience\\". Kirkwood explained that together he and Smithwick \\"decided that it was time for a big, show-stopping, blockbuster sequence to grab the audience's attention and hopefully bring them back to Hollyoaks. We realised we needed to engage some of the older audience again and this was how to do it\\". Smithwick and Kirkwood devised the Enjoy The Ride storyline which saw the deaths of four regular characters through a minibus crash. On 29 September 2012, it was announced Smithwick would leave Hollyoaks after stepping down from her role as series producer. At the British Soap Awards 2013, Hollyoaks won 5 awards including Best OnScreen Partnership (Kieron Richardson and Emmett Scalan); Best Actress (Claire Cooper); Sexiest Male (Danny Mac); Spectacular Scene (the bus crash); and Best Newcomer (Joe Thompson) References External links * Category:Living people Category:Irish television producers Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Soap opera producers ","title":"Emma Smithwick"},{"id":"33978047","text":"Michael Holmes (born June 1, 1989) is a former American football cornerback.

Looney Tunes cartoon, directed by Ben Hardaway. The short was released on November 17, 1934, and stars Buddy, the second star of the series. Summary Buddy and Cookie float through a terrible thunderstorm in a hot air balloon of Buddy's design. \\"In a few minutes, we'll be on Mars\\", promises Buddy. Cookie is afraid; when a bolt of lightning streaks by, Buddy nonchalantly dismisses it as probable flatulence on his part. But the next bolt sends Cookie into Buddy's arms, and both are sorely afraid. The balloon knocks into a storm cloud that resembles a human face: the cloud blows the delicate vessel into another, which instead of winds lends blows, like those of a boxer, to the balloon. The couple spins round and round until they encounter a cloud resembling a rattlesnake which spits such lightning that two of the balloon's tethers split; another bolt severs the basket entirely & the two fall, in a winding path, to the earth. The basket glides along, the balloon's anchor trailing behind, and Buddy and Cookie pass a signpost pointing in the direction whither they are headed: \\"To Lemonia, the Sour Domain.\\" A large bird, thinking it has dodged the oncoming cart, is caught by the trailing anchor and let off on a log. A gate opens at the sight of the basket, which continues to roll until it is dismantled by a crash. \\"Well, here we are!\\" Buddy announces, happily enough. \\"Alright, smarty, where are we?\\" replies Cookie. Both look up at the structure into which the basket crashed: \\"This is Sourtown.\\" And the sign continues to enumerate the rules of the domain: laughing, singing, dancing, and jazz music are expressly forbidden; but Buddy can not but be tickled by the absurdity of this, and laughs heartily at the very thought. He stops only when Cookie points out to him caricatures of Laurel and Hardy in the stocks for smiling and laughing, along with a tiny bird (another Laurel) similarly imprisoned for singing. Quietly, Buddy and Cookie spy three men, the smallest of them carrying a mandolin, drinking from a butt of vinegar and rhyming about their grim outlook on life, at \\"Ye Pessimist's Club\\". Optimist Buddy seeks no further restraint, and gladly intervenes on the meeting; picking up the mandolin, he plays and sings \\"Hey, Sailor!\\" as Cookie dances. Birds and flowers join in the song. A policeman hears the merriment, and sets off to catch the perpetrators; on hearing his approach, the three grouches sneak away, and Our Hero and his sweetheart are apprehended. Sourpan, king of Sourland, juices lemons with the crown atop his head, pours the liquid into a bowl, and drinks of it, further souring his countenance. The officer brings Buddy and Cookie before the crabby monarch, who sentences the guilty two to the punishment of spanking: for that purpose, a hand-cranked machine is freshly oiled. Duly scared, Cookie whispers to Buddy, \\"What'll we do?\\" \\"Leave it to me!\\" he responds. With that, Our Hero begins a rousing harmonica solo, to the terror of the king. Cookie dances, candles melt, the king's retinue begin to sway with the tune. Finally captivated, the king announces his pleasure with Buddy's music. The court sings; the king merrily dances on a rug, but loses his balance and falls into the spanking machine, chortling lustily as one of his men spanks him continually. Buddy, in triumph, sits, crowned, upon the king's throne; Cookie, beside him, now wears Buddy's hat; the two embrace.

It is a third-person shooter with strategy elements in which the player controls a fleet of tanks. It was originally developed and released on the Acorn Archimedes by Superior Software in 1988 and ported to other home computers in 1990 by Rainbow Arts. The game was well received, particularly for its blend of strategy and arcade action. Gameplay In-game screenshot (Amiga)The game is set in the Second World War era and in a 3D polygonal environment. The player controls a fleet of tanks from either the American, German or Russian army. There are various tanks available with different abilities from light, fast tanks that are easily damaged to heavy, slow tanks with high firepower. The player controls an individual tank from a third-person perspective with computer AI controlling the other friendly tanks as well as the enemy tanks. By switching to a map screen, the player can change which tank they control and also direct tanks to different places on the map. The game carries on in real-time while the player is looking at the map. Control can be split so that two players can cooperate to control the tank so one player drives the tank while the other controls the gun. Single players can choose for the computer to take the role of the second player or control both together. There are three types of game; 'Arcade', 'Attrition' and 'Strategy'. In the 'arcade' version, the player controls just one tank and faces a never-ending stream of enemy tanks that becomes progressively more difficult and cannot be 'won'. The object of the game is simply to survive as long as possible. The 'attrition' game gives the player a set fleet of tanks which are pitted against a similar set of enemy tanks. The 'strategy' version is the full game. The player begins with limited funds which are used to buy a fleet of tanks. Extra funds are gained by completing missions which can then be used to add to the fleet with up to fifteen tanks being available. Other extra features in this version of the game include artillery bombardment which can be ordered to strike at a specific point on the map and spotter planes which can be used to find out where the enemy tanks are on the map. Both of these actions use up funds. Tanks are damaged when hit but if they can be driven away from the combat area, they can be repaired. Missions are generally won either by destroying all enemy tanks or by occupying a specific point on the map for a set time without coming under attack. Development and release Conqueror was designed and coded by Jonathan Griffiths using the Zarch game engine which was created by David Braben (co-author of Elite). Like Zarch, it was originally developed and released on the 32-bit Acorn Archimedes. It was published in 1988 by Superior Software.Conqueror at The Centre for Computing History Following the success of Virus, the name given to Zarch for its multi-format release in 1988, Conqueror was also ported to the Amiga, Atari ST and DOS. The Amiga and ST ports were carried out by Griffiths (with graphics by Torsten Zimmerman),Conqueror at Atari ManiaConqueror at Hall of Light while the DOS version was ported by Chris Sawyer.Conqueror credits at MobyGames These versions were released by Rainbow Arts in 1990. Critical reception The game was well received by critics, generally comparable to Zarch/Virus. The Archimedes version was given a score of 931 (out of 1000) by ACE magazineConqueror review, Advanced Computer Entertainment, Issue 9, June 1988 and 87% by The Games Machine who viewed it as an improvement over Zarch; \\"With more depth than Superior's previous Archimedes game, Conqueror is a change towards the more strategic style of game and as such is a change for the better - a product that is addictive and challenging in both the arcade and strategy sense of the word\\".\\"I Came, I Saw\\", The Games Machine, Issue 10, September 1988 The later versions generally scored slightly lower in the muti- format magazines with ACE giving the Amiga and ST versions 925 and 920 respectively,Conqueror review, Advanced Computer Entertainment, Issue 30, March 1990 while The Games Machine gave both the ST and DOS versions 80%.Conqueror review, The Games Machine, Issue 29, April 1990 Amiga Format called the game \\"first-class\\", and said it \\"will appeal to everyone who likes a good blast but also likes to think they can master a situation by good tactical planning\\", awarding a score of 93%.Conqueror review, Amiga Format, Issue 9, April 1990 References External links * Category:1988 video games Category:Acorn Archimedes games Category:Amiga games Category:Atari ST games Category:DOS games Category:Europe-exclusive video games Category:Superior Software games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"Conqueror (video game)"},{"id":"33978199","text":"Moonlight Head is a locality located on the Great Ocean Road in southwest of Victoria on the Southern Ocean.

History  15th century  The islands of Cape Verde were discovered between 1460 and 1462 by Portuguese and Genoese sailors in the service of the Portuguese Crown. The southeastern islands, including the largest island Santiago, were discovered in 1460 by Ant√≥nio de Noli and Diogo Gomes. The remaining northwestern islands S√£o Nicolau, S√£o Vicente and Santo Ant√£o were discovered in 1461 or 1462 by Diogo Afonso.Valor simb√≥lico do centro hist√≥rico da Praia, Louren√ßo Concei√ß√£o Gomes, Universidade Portucalense, 2008 There is no evidence of human settlement on Cape Verde prior to the arrival of the Portuguese. In 1462, the town of Ribeira Grande (now Cidade Velha) was founded on the south coast of Santiago. The settlement became a key port of call for Portuguese colonisation towards Africa and South America. In the 16th and 17th centuries, it was a centre of maritime trade between Africa, the Cape, Brazil and the Caribbean. Due to its proximity to the African coast, it was an essential platform for the trade of enslaved persons. Other early Portuguese settlements were S√£o Filipe on the island of Fogo (between 1470 and 1490),Centre historique de S√£o Filipe, UNESCO Praia on Santiago (before 1516), Ribeira Grande on Santo Ant√£o (mid 16th century) and Ribeira Brava on S√£o Nicolau (1653).Invent√°rio dos recursos tur√≠sticos do munic√≠pio de Ribeira Brava de S√£o Nicolau, Direc√ß√£o Geral do Turismo, p. 16 In 1492 the Spanish Inquisition emerged in its fullest expression of anti-Semitism. It spread to neighboring Portugal where King Jo√£o II and especially Manuel I in 1496, decided to exile thousands of Jews to S√£o Tom√©, Pr√≠ncipe, and Cape Verde. They were allowed to engage in trade. Free- lance traders were referred to as lan√ßados, who were often, but not always, of Jewish origin.  16th‚Äî19th centuries  The riches of Ribeira Grande and conflicts between Portugal and rival colonial powers France and Britain attracted pirate attacks, including those by Francis Drake (1585) and Jacques Cassard (1712). Despite the construction of Forte Real de S√£o Filipe in 1587-93, Ribeira Grande remained vulnerable and went into decline. The capital was moved to Praia in 1770.Centre historique de Praia, UNESCO The eruption of the volcano Pico do Fogo in 1680 covered much of the island of Fogo in ash, which forced many inhabitants to flee to the nearby island of Brava. From the end of the 18th century, whaling ships from North America started hunting whales around the Azores and the Cape Verde Islands. They used the harbours of Brava to stock up on supplies and drinking water. They hired men from Brava as sailors, and several of these settled around the Massachusetts whaling port of New Bedford. The exploitation of salt on the island of Sal took a rise from around 1800. The port city of Mindelo grew rapidly after 1838, when a coal depot was established to supply ships on Atlantic routes.G√©nese e desenvolvimento da cidade do Mindelo: a preserva√ß√£o de uma identidade, Fred Yanick Fonseca Delgado, 2016, p. 76-80 In the course of the 19th century, the Plateau of Praia was completely redeveloped with streets according to a grid plan, lined with grand colonial buildings and mansions. Slavery was abolished in Cape Verde in 1876. 20th century Am√≠lcar Cabral on an East German stamp From the beginning of the 20th century the port of Mindelo lost its importance for transatlantic navigation. Causes for this were the shift from coal to oil as fuel for ships, the rise of competing ports like Dakar and the Canary Islands and the lack of investment in port infrastructure. Due to its generally dry climate, Cape Verde has been struck by a series of drought- related famines between the 1580s and the 1950s. Two of Cape Verde's worst- ever famines occurred in 1941‚Äì43 and 1947‚Äì48, killing an estimated 45,000 people. Several thousands of islanders emigrated, for instance accepting contract labour on the cocoa plantations of Portuguese S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe. In the lead-up to and during the Portuguese Colonial War, those planning and fighting in the armed conflict in Portuguese Guinea often linked the goal of liberation of Guinea-Bissau to the goal of liberation in Cape Verde. For instance, in 1956, Am√≠lcar and Lu√≠s Cabral founded the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). However, there was no armed conflict in Cape Verde, and ultimately independence for Cape Verde resulted from negotiation with Portugal after the April 1974 Carnation Revolution.Ant√≥nio Costa Pinto, \\"The transition to democracy and Portugal's decolonization\\", in Stewart Lloyd-Jones and Ant√≥nio Costa Pinto (eds., 2003). The Last Empire: Thirty Years of Portuguese Decolonization (Intellect Books, ) pp. 22‚Äì24. In August 1974, an agreement was signed in Algiers between the Portuguese government and the PAIGC, recognising the independence of Guinea- Bissau and the right to independence of Cape Verde.Acordo entre o governo Portugu√™s e o Partido Africano da Independ√™ncia da Guin√© e Cabo Verde, Centro de Documenta√ß√£o 25 de Abril On 5 July 1975, at Praia, Portugal's Prime Minister Vasco Gon√ßalves turned over power to National Assembly President Ab√≠lio Duarte, and Cape Verde became independent. Cape Verde Islanders had higher educational levels and were often appointed to low-level administrative posts in Portuguese territories. Thereby they acquired a reputation of loyalty to Lisbon.Alexander Keese, \\"The role of Cape Verdeans in war mobilization and war prevention in Portugal's African empire, 1955-1965.\\" International journal of African historical studies 40.3 (2007): 497-511 online.

Originally conceived by the members of Coldcut on the Ninja Tune independent record label, the project started in 1990 on the premise of providing metaphorical \\"food for DJs\\". DJ Food released the Jazz Brakes series, with Jazz Brakes Volume 3 being the most successful. The records consisted of collections of breaks, loops and samples that could be used for mixing, remixing and producing. The later DJ Food albums have developed with shades of Latin, dub, breakbeat, ambient, and drum and bass. The 1995 album A Recipe for Disaster was a conscious move away from the Jazz Brakes volumes to form more of an identity as an artist, and a remix album of tracks from all six LPs, entitled Refried Food was released the following year. The more recent release, Kaleidoscope (2000), featured guest artists including Bundy K. Brown (formerly of Tortoise, Directions in Music, Pullman) and voiceover artist and jazz poet, Ken Nordine. Members DJ Food started as a Coldcut side project from Jonathan More and Matt Black. Along the way they met Patrick Carpenter, who was listed on the liner notes, but only his initials. A loose collaborative team began to form including Paul Brook, Paul Rabiger, Kevin Foakes a.k.a. Strictly Kev and Issac Elliston. Although keeping their hand in as DJs on the albums, Black and More could not perform DJ sets twice in one night under the aliases of both Coldcut & DJ Food, so they handed the mantle of live performances over to PC and Strictly Kev. Later, PC became so involved with The Cinematic Orchestra that he decided to quit DJ Food, leaving Strictly Kev as the sole director of the project. He has since contributed three remixes to The Shape of Things That Hum EP in 2009.

He currently is the wide receivers coach for the University of Idaho. He was formerly the head football coach at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass), for two seasons. Molnar had previously been the offensive coordinator at the University of Notre Dame. Coaching career Early positions Molnar began his coaching career at his alma mater Lock Haven University from 1984 to 1986, working with the wide receivers, tight ends, running backs and placekickers. He made his first entry into major college football as a graduate assistant at Virginia from 1987 to 1988. While with the Cavaliers, he assisted the quarterbacks coach. Molnar then called the offensive plays and coached quarterbacks at Western Carolina in 1989. He spent time as offensive coordinator as well as working with quarterbacks and wide receivers at Illinois State from 1990 to 1993, followed by seven seasons in the same capacity at Kent State from 1994 to 2000. Molnar coached quarterbacks at Eastern Michigan in 2002 and then from 2003 to 2004 at Western Michigan. He directed another record-setting quarterback during his only season at Indiana State in 2005. As the associate head coach and offensive coordinator of the Sycamores, Molnar‚Äôs offense broke six school passing records (including passing yards, completion percentage and touchdown passes) and two of his players combined to break 11 single-season or single-game school marks. Central Michigan Molnar coached the quarterbacks and wide receivers at Central Michigan under head coach Brian Kelly and developed the most prolific freshman quarterback and wide receiver duo in the nation in 2006. Dan LeFevour was named Mid-American Conference (MAC) Freshman of the Year and was selected first-team all-MAC after he led the conference in passing touchdowns, passing yards, passing efficiency, completion percentage, total completions and total yards. Under Molnar‚Äôs tutelage, LeFevour completed 247 of 388 pass attempts for 3,031 yards with 26 touchdowns. He also rushed 132 times for 521 yards and seven touchdowns and ranked 13th nationally in total offense (253.7 yards per game). LeFevour set school records for passing yards and touchdown passes, and his 3,552 total yards also were a Central Michigan record. He finished his rookie campaign ranked 19th nationally in passing efficiency. Cincinnati From 2007 to 2009, Molnar followed coach Brian Kelly to Cincinnati and continued to help develop record-breaking quarterbacks and wide receivers. With the Bearcats, Molnar was passing game coordinator and coached the wide receivers. He oversaw the two most prolific passing seasons in Cincinnati history and mentored a pair of record-setting receivers. Molnar was a large part of the historic 2009 season where the Bearcats won the Big East Conference Championship, played Florida in the Sugar Bowl and finished third in the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) rankings. Notre Dame When Brian Kelly was hired as the head coach at Notre Dame in December 2009, Molnar was shortly thereafter named his offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. In 2010, his first year with the Irish, Molnar helped install a new offensive system and developed both Dayne Crist and Tommy Rees as first-time starting quarterbacks. Crist started the first nine games and passed for 2,033 yards with 15 touchdowns before injuring a knee in the first quarter of the ninth game. Rees played the rest of the ninth game after Crist was injured and completed 33 of 54 passes for 334 yards with four touchdowns. In 2011, Molnar helped the Irish earn a second straight bowl game bid thanks in part to the play of quarterback Tommy Rees. Rees threw for over 2,700 yards that season with 19 touchdowns averaging 225.7 yards per game. As a unit, the Irish averaged 424.1 yards per game on offense thanks in part to Rees and 1,000-yard rusher Cierre Wood. UMass On December 8, 2011, Molnar was named the new head coach of the UMass Minutemen football team, replacing ousted coach Kevin Morris. The 2012 season was the team's first as a member of the Mid-American Conference, and UMass' final transition year to NCAA Division I FBS play. In his inaugural season with the Minutemen the team would struggle in their first year of FBS Football play. UMass would finish with an overall record of 1‚Äì11, including a 1‚Äì7 conference record, which placed them in 6th place in the MAC East. Molnar won his first game as a head coach on November 10, 2012, with a 22‚Äì14 victory over Akron. Molnar was fired on December 26, 2013 after going 2‚Äì22 over the course of two seasons.

Following the Haysoms' murders, she and S√∂ring were arrested in London, England, for check fraud and shoplifting. Haysom was serving a 90-year prison sentence at the Fluvanna Correctional Center for Women in Troy, Virginia after pleading guilty to two counts of accessory to murder before the fact in 1987. She and Soering were paroled on November 25, 2019, more than 30 years after they were first convicted in the gruesome slayings of Haysom‚Äôs parents in 1985. Early life Elizabeth Haysom was the child of Derek William Reginald Haysom, a steel executive, and Nancy Astor Benedict Haysom, an artist. Derek and Nancy had a combined total of five children from previous marriages. Born in April 1964, Elizabeth attended boarding schools in Switzerland and England (Wycombe Abbey), then enrolled at the University of Virginia. It was there she met her 18-year-old boyfriend Jens S√∂ring, the son of a German diplomat and a Jefferson Scholar at the university. Murders On the morning of April 3rd, 1985, when S√∂ring was 18 and Haysom was 20, the bodies of Derek and Nancy Haysom were discovered. They had been slashed and stabbed to death in their home in the then unincorporated hamlet of Boonsboro in Bedford County, Virginia. Both Derek and Nancy were almost decapitated. The couple's bodies were not discovered until days after the murder. During the timeline of the murder, Haysom had rented a car. She and Jens drove to Washington, D.C. to establish an alibi.Bedford County Sheriffs Office Flight to England Haysom and S√∂ring were not initially suspects in the Haysoms' murders. Six months after the murder, S√∂ring and Haysom went to England, where they were arrested on 30 April 1986 for writing over $5,000 ($ today) in fake cashier checks and then using false documentation and lying to the police in London. Convictions In 1987, instead of going to trial, then 23-year-old Haysom pleaded guilty to two counts of accessory to murder before the fact, and was sentenced to 90 years in prison - one 45-year sentence for each murder, to be served consecutively. S√∂ring was sentenced, in 1990, to two consecutive life terms for first-degree murder. Haysom became eligible for parole in 1995, resubmitting a parole request every three years thereafter. On 25 November 2019, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam announced that both Haysom and S√∂ring would be released, but not pardoned, and sent back to their respective home countries. After more than 30 years in prison, Haysom was released from prison to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on parole in November of 2019. She was deported to her home country of Canada. She had been incarcerated at the Fluvanna Correctional Center for Women in Troy, Virginia at the time she was paroled. Under mandatory parole, Haysom was required to be released no later than 2032, 45 years after her conviction. In the media The S√∂ring/Haysom criminal proceedings were the first to be broadcast nationwide on American television. The Haysoms' murders have been profiled by 20/20, The Investigators, Geraldo Rivera, The New Detectives, City Confidential, Wicked Attraction, Deadly Women, On the Case with Paula Zahn, Snapped: Killer Couples, and Southern Fried Homicide. Killing for Love, a feature documentary film, premiered at the Munich International Film Festival and was released theatrically in October 2016.  Granted parole  Haysom was sentenced to 90 years in jail, but was released on parole in November of 2019. Her parole caused frustration of many law officials since it was granted based on financial benefits for the state of Virginia, rather than good merit. The chair of the Virginia Parole Board, Adrianne L. Bennett, added that the decision to grant Haysom parole was also justified by her young age at the time the crime was committed.She was released into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, since she was a Canadian citizen. Haysom remains in a ICE facility in Georgia, even though there is a mandate for her deportation from 1989. Jens Soering, Haysom's alleged accomplice was granted parole as well, but was deported to his home country of Germany promptly after his release.

She operated out of Arklow after 1909. She was in Hamburg on the day that Britain entered the First World War with its declaration of war against Germany. Her crew was imprisoned and she was impounded and used as a barge to carry munitions. After the war, in difficult economic conditions, she resumed trading. In 1929, a collier collided with, and sunk, her; however she was successfully salvaged. During the Second World War she supplied Irish agricultural products to Britain, and brought coal to Ireland. In 1952 she featured in the film Moby Dick. While still configured as a whaler she was damaged, beyond repair, by a storm. Early career James Postlethwaite was built by William Ashburner and Son at Barrow and was launched on 11 August 1881. She was the second-last schooner built by William Ashburner and Son at Barrow. William Ashburner died six days after James Postlethwaite was launched. James Postlethwaite and ME Johnson were identical, having been built to the same plans, in the same yard.Latham page 55 James Postlethwaite was named after James Postlethwaite of Gleaston.James Postlethwaite was named after James Postlethwaite, who died c 1880, from Gleaston of the shipbuilding firm of Perry & Oistlethwaite in Ulverston. The Ashburners built the ships for their own fleet: Thomas Ashburner & Co. Captain Robert Roskell was the first master of James Postlethwaite. James Postlethwaite and ME Johnson were tramp coasters.Smith, page 37 They served the ports of Britain and the east coast of Ireland as well as French and Belgian channel ports; but never ventured further. The Ashburner fleet was sold by auction in 1909. Arklow ship-owners were very interested. Captain Ned Hall bought James Postlethwaite for ¬£995.Greenhill page 195 ME Johnson was bought for ¬£1110 by an Arklow consortium led by Captain Frank Tyrrell. William Ashburner was the last to be auctioned, she was older, was built in 1876, yet went for a higher price than expected. In time, William Ashburner would join the Arklow fleet. First World War Under Captain Ned Hall, James Postlethwaite frequented continental ports. On 28 July 1914, the day Britain declared war on Germany, James Postlethwaite was in Hamburg. The ship was seized and the crew imprisoned. There were five other Irish ships of the Palgrave-Murphy Line in the port on that day. Some should have left, but the German port authorities used various excuses to delay their departure.Smith, page 59 They were City of Berlin, City of Cadiz, City of Belfast, City of Hamburg and City of Munich. The ships were expropriated and their crews imprisoned. The City of Berlin was sunk as a blockship. Other Arklow ships were lost, such as Robert Tyrrell's Vindex which was abandoned by her crew as the Germans overran Antwerp. On the other side, William Hall's Barkdale was detained by the Royal Navy. She was to deliver coal to Guaymas, Mexico. The coal was suspected of being destined for German surface raiders. German ships in British ports were also seized and most were auctioned off. Three German schooners joined the Arklow fleet. Captain George Tyrrell bought Erica for ¬£1880, Captain Gregory bought Neptun for ¬£370 and renamed her Kings Hill while Captain Gregory bought Johanna for ¬£1510 and renamed her Shelton Abbey. While renaming ships was common elsewhere, it was very unusual in Arklow.Forde Maritime Arklow page 173 Erica was sunk by the u-boat U-110 on 8 February 1918 off Bardsey Island. The Germans cut down James Postlethwaites masts, converting her into a barge. She was used to carry ammunition on the Elbe.  Ruhleben internment camp  The crews were imprisoned first in Hamburg and then transferred to Ruhleben internment camp on a racecourse at Spandau near Berlin. Conditions were congested, insanitary, cold and dark. When Captain Tyndall of City of Belfast fell ill, Captain Hall of James Postlethwaite cared for both crews. The City of Belfast had crew from Arklow and Rush, under Captain George Tyndall. Other Arklow seamen from the Wilson Line also associated with them, and there were 23 others from Rush. There were over 4,000 prisoners in Ruhleben, all were civilians. A third of them were seamen. The prisoners were allowed to administer their own affairs. Sporting, cultural and educational groups developed. The 'Ruhleben Irish Players' staged plays by Synge and Shaw while Shakespeares plays were performed by the 'Ruhleban Dramatic Society'. The prison authorities banned Shaw's Arms and the Man,Ketchum, page 201 declaring \\"militaristic plays will not be tolerated\\".. The 'Ruhleben Irish Players' included not just the seamen but other Irish civilians, such as R. M. Smyllie. There were classes in navigation. A pupil from Dublin, of the City of Belfast obtained his extra-masters certificate and went on to beharbour master of Adelaide. There were efforts to arrange a prisoner exchange by Captain Donelan Chief Whip of the Irish Party, John T. Donovan and other MPs from the Home Rule PartyForde Maritime Arklow page 182 and Irish Peers, such as, Lord Charles Beresford, with little success. 55 prisoners were released for Christmas 1915, including 2 from Arklow.Forde Maritime Arklow 177One of them, Joseph Kane of the City of Munich, went back to sea on SS Ottokar and was lost when she was sunk on 11 December 1917 On 10 October 1918, a month before the armistice, a large group of prisoners, including most of the Irish, were released. This was the day that was torpedoed and sunk by UB-123 off Dublin with the loss of over 500 lives ‚Äì the greatest single loss of life in the Irish Sea. Many of the prisoners were ill. Captain George Tyndall of the City of Belfast died ten days after his release.Forde Maritime Arklow page 185  Post First World War  After the war, James Postlethwaite was returned to Captain Ed Hall. She was initially towed to South Shields for refitting as new masts were required, then to Arklow and rerigged.Forde Maritime Arklow page 78 She resumed trading under Captain Hall, on a route from Shields to St. Valery. By now sail was significantly less economic than motor vessels, but with the mini-boom which followed the war, sailing ships could still obtain cargoes. In Ireland, the internal road and rail networks had been neglected. It was often cheaper to send goods by sea rather than by road or rail.Freight from Arklow to Dublin by sea was 20% cheaper than by rail.Forde Maritime Arklow page 50 For some years, James Postlethwaite secured such cargoes. In 1926 an auxiliary engine was installed in James Postlethwaite. There was a good trade in sending wooden pit props to Wales. The miners strike of 1926 caused many schooners to be laid-up. Captain Ned Hall retired in 1926. In April 1929 Captain William HaganCaptain William Hagan, born 1884, 17 Fair Green, Arklow, died August 1935 purchased shares in James Postlethwaite and took command. On the night of 11 May 1929 James Postlethwaite was at anchor in Carlingford Lough. She was rammed by the steam collier JJ Monks and sunk. Captain William Hagan and the crew were rescued by the collier. James Postlethwaite was salvaged and repaired. Sailing ships became less popular in busy ports. Motor ships were easier to manoeuvre and faster to discharge and load. James Postlethwaite was relegated to the smaller ports, carrying less valuable cargoes such as kelp from Kilrush to Bowling. It was difficult to compete with motor vessels. The Anglo-Irish Trade War reduced the volume of cargoes which could be carried. Competition became impossible when Dutch coasters arrived. They were subsidised by the Dutch government.Forde Maritime Arklow page 52 The Arklow schooners could no longer secure cargoes, they were tied up along the Avoca River, where they were left to decay.  Second World War  At the outbreak of the Second World War, known as \\"The Emergency\\" Ireland declared neutrality and became isolated as never before.Ferriter, page 100: (Quoting Garvin) \\"Irish isolationism was a very powerful cultural sentiment at that time\\". Shipping had been neglected since the Irish War of Independence. Foreign ships, on which Ireland's trade had hitherto depended, were less available. In his Saint Patrick's Day address in 1940, Taoiseach (Prime Minister) √âamon de Valera lamented: \\"No country had ever been more effectively blockaded because of the activities of belligerents and our lack of ships...\\" √âamon de Valera advocated self-sufficiency and discouraged International trade, saying: \\"It was an important status symbol in the modern world for a country to produce her own goods and be self- sufficient.\\"Dwyer, page 81. At the end of the civil war in 1923, the merchant fleet consisted of 127 ships. At the start of World War II in 1939, the fleet numbered only 56 ships.Forde The Long Watch, page 1. That 56 included the sailing ships taken out of retirement. Only 5% of imports were carried on Irish flagged vessels.McIvor, page 85. Ireland was a net food exporter. The excess was shipped to Britain. It was sailing ships, such as James Postlethwaite who had long past their retirement which ensured that Irish agricultural exports reached Britain, and that British coal arrived in Ireland. Sailing ships, which had been left to rot, were refitted out and once more took to the seas. One, the Arklow schooner Antelope, had been tied up for seven years. Brooklands of Cork was built in 1859.Forde Long Watch, page 2 Some were beyond salvage. The Avoca river was cleared of old decayed, derelicts, They were broken up for fire-wood. 14 Arklow schooners resumed service under the tricolour, while one flew the Red Ensign.  Final career  In 1945 she was given a new 120hp diesel engine; her masts were more drastically reduced and she was now little more than a motorship.Latham page 116 At the end of the war, the Dutch motor vessels returned, and sail could not economically compete. By 1950 Arklow ship-owners had acquired modern motor ships. Captain James Tyrrell purchased Halronell. Captain Victor Hall acquired Kilbride. James Postlethwaite made her last visit to Barrow in 1952 and soon after she was laid up at Arklow, the schooner trade by then being virtually defunct. James Postlethwaite had one last role to play. The Arklow schooners James Postlethwaite and Harvest King starred in the film Moby Dick. In 1954 James Postlethwaite was towed by MV George Emelie to Youghal, where John Huston was filming \\"Moby Dick\\". She was outfitted as a whaler. James Postlethwaite played the part of Devil-Dam, while Harvest King was Tit-Bit and Pequod was the schooner Ryelands. In November a gale smashed James Postlethwaite into the quay at Youghal, causing irreparable damage. She was beached and remained derelict until she was finally set on fire on 7 October 1957. The wheel of the James Postlethwaite was salvaged and is now on display at the Moby Dick Inn.

LSF conducted historical research, maintained archives and published historically relevant materials and information. On December 1, 2015, the LSF and the Chemical Heritage Foundation finalized a merger, creating one organization that covers \\"the history of the life sciences and biotechnology together with the history of the chemical sciences and engineering.\\" As of February 1, 2018, the organization was renamed the Science History Institute, to reflect its wider range of historical interests, from chemical sciences and engineering to the life sciences and biotechnology. The organization is headquartered in Philadelphia but retains offices in the San Francisco Bay area. Mandate The LSF mandate was to collect and promote the history of biotechnology. This includes telling the stories of \\"scientists, inventors, entrepreneurs, managers, executives, and financiers\\" in order to \\"humanize\\" biotechnology to a lay audience. The history of the biotechnology industry includes examining the complex relationships and socio-political dynamics that occur when science and entrepreneurship come together. History The idea for a foundation that would collect and share the history of biotechnology came about at a meeting in early January 2009 in San Francisco attended by G. Steven Burrill of Burrill & Company, Dennis Gillings of Quintiles in Durham, NC,, John Lechleiter of Eli Lilly & Co., Henri Termeer, then CEO of Genzyme and Arnold Thackray, founding President and CEO of the Chemical Heritage Foundation (CHF) Thackray had shaped Chemical Heritage Foundation‚Äî\\"the premier institution preserving the history of chemistry, chemical engineering, and related sciences and technologies.\\" Oral history was one component of the CHF mandate of preserving interpreting, and promoting the history of science. In 1982 the University of Pennsylvania and the American Chemical Society had launched the Center for the History of Chemistry which was renamed the Chemical Heritage Foundation (CHF) in 1992. Thackray, a Fellow of American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Royal Historical Society and the Royal Society of Chemistry, Thackray received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in the history of science from Cambridge University. Thackray argued that before LSF was founded, the recorded history of biotechnology was \\"fragmented, uneven, and rather paltry.\\" He observed that, \\"If you don't write your own history, somebody else will do it for you, and they may be hostile.\\" By the end of 2011, LSF's steering committee of industry leaders‚Äî Joshua Boger, Robert Carpenter, Bob Coughlin, Henri Termeer and Peter Wirth‚Äî were promoting the foundation's work by encouraging scientists and industrialists who were members of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council, to contribute potential stories and materials to the archival record of the history of biotechnology in Boston and the surrounding region.  Oral History Program  The Life Sciences Foundation conducted oral history interviews with scientists, entrepreneurs, executives, policy makers, and leaders of thought in the biotechnology industry. LSF's hosts timelines, transcripts and audio recordings and provides links to existing oral histories housed at institutions across the globe.  Archives  Original documentary materials pertinent to the history of biotechnology and the life sciences are being collected. The materials include personal papers and correspondence, donated company records, laboratory notebooks, photographs, video and audio recordings. Collected materials will be guided to permanent repositories in appropriate institutional settings. Electronic reproductions will be made available to scholars, journalists, educators, and the general public in a digital archive.  Publications  LSF historians work on a range of publications including a quarterly magazine, scholarly articles, white papers, and books. These works are intended for multiple audiences and focused on the emergence and evolution of biotechnologies in pharmaceutical discovery and development, agriculture, energy production, and environmental remediation. In October 2011, the University of Chicago Press released Genentech: The Beginnings of Biotech by Life Sciences Foundation historian Sally Smith Hughes. Board of directors Founding partners of the Life Sciences Foundation include Burrill, Celgene, John Lechleiter, Genentech, Henri Termeer, Merck & Co., Millennium, Pfizer, Quintiles, and Thermo Fisher. MIT professor, Phillip Sharp, serves as LSF's academic advisor. Its executive and advisory board members are leaders from biotech, venture capital, academic institutions and trade associations. When Thackray retired in 2012, Heather R. Erickson, 34, was appointed as LSF President and CEO and member of the Board of Directors. Thackray remained as LSF advisor to its scholarly activities.

The events were part of the Hamidian massacres and targeted the vilayet's Christian population ‚Äì Armenians and Assyrians. The massacres were initially directed at Armenians, instigated by Ottoman politicians and clerics under the pretext of their desire to dismantle the state, but they soon changed into a general anti-Christian pogrom as the killing moved to the Diyarbekir Vilayet and surrounding areas of Tur Abdin, which was inhabited by Assyrian/Syriac Christians. Contemporary accounts put the total number of Assyrians killed between 1894‚Äì96 at around 25,000.  Background  Kurdish raids on villages in the Diyarbekir Vilayet intensified in the years following a famine that ravaged the region. This was followed by fierce battles between Kurds and Shammar Arabs. In August 1888, Kurdish Aghas led attacks on Assyrian villages in Tur Abdin killing 18. Requests for an investigation by Patriarch Ignatius Peter IV went unanswered by the Porte. Another Kurdish raid in October 1889 targeted several Assyrian/Syriac villages during which 40 villagers including women and children were killed. These events were the first signs of the massacres that would characterise the Diyarbekir Vilayet for the following decade. The Hamidian massacres came when some 4,000 Armenians in the Sasun district of Bitlis Vilayet in 1894 rebelled against Kurdish nomadic tribes, who demanded traditional taxes from them. Local authorities reported this to the Sultan as a major revolt. The Sultan responded by sending the Ottoman army supported by the Hamidiye cavalry and local Kurdish tribes. After clashing with the Armenian rebels, the Kurds descended upon Armenian villages in the regions of Sasun (Sassoun) and Talori, between Mu≈ü and Silvan, massacring its inhabitants and burning several Christian villages. More than 7,500 Armenians died as a result, and an intervention by European powers lead to the dismissal of the Governor of Bitlis, Bahri Pa≈üa, in January 1895. Three European Powers - Britain, France and Russia - thinking that reform of the Ottoman local government would help to prevent violence as occurred in Sasun, proposed to Sultan Abdul Hamid II a reform plan, planning control of the Kurds and the employment of Christian assistant-governors. The Sultan was unwilling to yield to the desires of the Powers. During the Spring and Summer of 1895 months of unfruitful negotiations passed. After a demonstration in Constantinople on September 30, 1895, organised by the Armenian Hunchakian Party to ask for speedy enactment of the reforms, Christian neighbourhoods in the city were attacked by angry Muslim mobs and the city descended into chaos. The massacre in Constantinople was followed by more Muslim-Armenian conflict in other areas, always costing the lives of vastly more Christians than Muslims.Selim Deringil. \\"The Armenian Question Is Finally Closed\\": Mass Conversions of Armenians in Anatolia during the Hamidian Massacres of 1895‚Äì1897, p351-352, in Comparative Studies in Society and History, 2009;51(2). Quote: \\"In Trabzon on 13 September 1895, the Muslim dead numbered eleven whereas the Armenians lost 182. In Erzurum on 23 October the ratio was five Muslim dead to fifty Armenians. In Bitlis, on 26 October, the toll is Muslims 38 dead and 135 wounded, Armenians 132 dead and 40 wounded. In Bayburt on 4 November, against eight dead and eleven wounded on the Muslim side, 170 Armenians died and thirty-five were wounded\\", and footnote 38: \\"The sheer discrepancy in the number of Muslim and Armenian dead could not be hidden even by those official documents carefully chosen to make the Turkish case...\\" Western pressure on the Sultan increased, and he eventually gave in to their demands and a Firman of the reforms was issued in October 1895. In retrospect, the announcement of the reforms only exacerbated the already heated atmosphere in the Ottoman Empire. As news of clashes and massacres spread throughout the empire Diyarbekir also took its share, with Muslim-Christian distrust reaching unprecedented levels. Generally Muslims had a distorted view of what the European-inspired reforms would mean. Muslims, also in Diyarbakƒ±r, thought that an Armenian Kingdom was about to be created under protection of European Powers and the end of Islamic rule was imminent. Muslim civilians bought large amounts of weapons and ammunition. The influential Kurdish Sheikh of Zilan, who played an important role in the massacres of Armenians in Sasun and Mush in the previous year, was present in the city inciting the Muslims against Christians. It was rumoured that Kurdish tribal leaders outside the town had promised to send 10,000 Kurdish fighters to avenge themselves. Muslim notables in Diyarbakƒ±r, who had lost their trust in the Sultan, telegraphed him that:  Massacre in the city of Diyarbakƒ±r, Nov.1-3, 1895   Prelude to the massacre  On 4 October 1895, Mehmed Enis Pasha, an official highly disliked among the city's Christians for his alleged role in a fire that destroyed Christian shops in Mardin, was appointed the governor of the city. The governor tried to force the Christian notables and communal leaders to sign telegrams of gratitude to Constantinople for his appointment. This provoked a harsh reaction from the Armenians and the Assyrians; Armenian shops were closed down, people protested in their churches, prevented masses, and continuously rang the bells \\"for three days and three nights\\". A petition was signed by 1200 people and was sent to the Armenian Patriarchate to protest their support for the governor, the Assyrian bishop of the city was forced to seek refuge in the French consulate. The protests continued until a response was received from the Patriarchate, which took ten days. This caused significant discontent among the Muslims, the army commander reportedly prevented the torching of Christian shops. The announcement of the reforms exacerbated the violent tendencies and \\"sinister rumors\\" of plans by Muslims began to circulate. The governor warned the Muslims to refrain from any attacks on Christians, reminding them that Islam banned murder. However, on his official taking of the office on 31 October, no Christian communal leaders were present.  The massacre  The massacres began in the city of Diyarbakƒ±r on November 1, 1895, after unidentified individuals fired shots outside the Grand Mosque (\\"Ulu Cami\\") in the city centre during the midday Muslim Prayer. The French consul, Meyrier, received reports that a policeman had first shot a Chaldean passing by during the prayers, while Ottoman documents reported that Assyrians had begun shooting while the Muslims were praying. Muslims began attacking Armenians in the surroundings, soon the violence turned against all Christians and spread throughout the city. They then started looting, and were joined by common civilians and government officials alike. The entire market area was set on fire, the fire soon got out of control and destroyed hundreds of shops and workshops, with smoke visible from Ergani, at a distance of 55 km. The Christians who could not run away from the mob were shot. The financial losses on the first day were estimated at about two million Turkish Pounds. Attacks on Christian neighbourhoods began the following morning in a systematic manner: houses were looted and burned; men, women and children killed; and girls were kidnapped and converted to Islam. The French vice-consul writes that the authorities had to close the city gates \\"fearing the coming of Kurdish tribes on the outskirts of the city, which do not differentiate between Muslims and Christians in their raids\\". Some Christians were able to protect themselves with the few weapons that they had owned in narrow streets which were defendable. More than 3,000 Christian of all denominations gathered at the monastery of the Capuchin Fathers in the city, and about 1,500 were protected by the French Consulate. The French Consulate was then targeted by the mob, who shot at the walls. While the consulate did not fall, there was significant fear that it would be captured, and the consul reportedly ordered his wife and children to be shot if that was the case. Only a brief telegram appealing for help could be sent to the embassy in Constantinople. The Diyarbakƒ±r massacres continued to the third day, but later ended upon the orders of the governor, proclaiming that anybody caught using weapons would receive severe punishment. However, before the order, law enforcement officials had participated in the looting. There was no participation from Kurds outside the city; 2500 of them gathered outside the city walls but not let in. There are varying estimates regarding the death toll in the city. The official Ottoman report of the provincial government gave it as 480 Christians and 130 Muslims. However, Meyrier reported 1191 Christian death (including, but not limited to, 1000 Armenians and 150 Assyrians), and 195 Muslims. Meyrier also reported 2000 missing people, but Hallward, the British Vice-Consul who came to Diyarbakƒ±r the following year, determined a Christian death toll around 1000, implying that the missing had survived and been accounted for. 155 women were kidnapped by Kurds. Many Christians survived the killings by converting to Islam at gunpoint. According to some accounts, some 25,000 Armenians turned to Islam during the massacres. Many of them returned to Christianity after the end of the period of persecution and returned to their villages once again. William Ainger Wigram visited the region a few years later and witnessed the traces of the destruction. According to him, the Assyrians of the city of Diyarbakƒ±r suffered less than their Armenian co-religionists whose district was still completely demolished. He also observed strong anti-Christian sentiments among the city's Muslims.  Massacres to the East of Diyarbakƒ±r  Massacres in the countryside continued for 46 days after the initial massacres in Diyarbakƒ±r city. In the village of Sa'diye inhabited by 3000 Armenians and Assyrians, the Turks first killed the men, then the women and finally the children. A group of villagers attempted to shelter in a church but the Kurds burnt it and killed those inside. Only three made it out alive by hiding amongst the corpses. In Mayafaraqin (Silvan, Farkin), a town of 3000 mixed Armenian, Jacobite and Protestant Christians, only 15 survived the killings, the rest were killed in a manner similar to what happened Sa'diye. The Assyrian village of Qarabash was destroyed and in Qatarball only 4 people survived of 300 families: most of the villagers died after being burnt alive in the church they had gathered. Isaac Armalet, a contemporary Syriac Catholic priest, counts 10 more villages which were entirely erased from the map, amounting to a total of 4,000 victims. Uƒüur √úmit √úng√∂r gives the number of Armenians killed in the \\"outlying villages\\" of Diyarbakƒ±r as 800-900. The total number of people left in need of nutrition and shelter in the province was estimated at 50,000 by Meyrier, Hallward later revised the figure to 20,000-30,000 (excluding Mardin and Palu). Hallward gave the number of homeless people in Silvan as 10,000.  Massacres in Tur Abdin  Mardin, the largest city and the capital of the subprovince (sancak) of Mardin, was spared the massacres inflicted on the other sancak's of Diyarbakƒ±r. Many of its Muslim notables were anxious in protecting their own interests and wanted to maintain the tolerant image of the city. The city was also characterized by the fact that the neighbourhoods of Muslims and Christians were intermingled, making it difficult to distinguish between them: the Muslims knew that the entry of outside forces would lead to an indiscriminate massacre of its inhabitants. The first Kurds entered the city on 9 November, coming from the village of Ain Sinja which they had destroyed. A local Muslim force confronted them and drove them back. The Governor then arranged the city's defenses and also distributed weapons among its Christian population. Two subsequent attempts by the Kurds to break into the city also failed. It was only at the end of November that the governor of Diyarbakƒ±r issued an order to protect the churches, although the atmosphere remained tense until the spring of 1896. Despite the protection of the Christians of Mardin, the neighboring villages in Tur Abdin faced a different fate. The village of Tell Armen was completely sacked and burned and its church partially destroyed; al-Kulye, made up of about 2,000 Jacobite individuals was also destroyed and burned down, killing about 50 of its inhabitants; Banabil was also attacked and destroyed. While al-Mansurye survived after receiving support nearby villages., the village of Qalaat Mara, seat of the Jacobite Patriarch, was abandoned after the Kurds attacked it. Its residents sought refuge at the Saffron Monastery, were they arranged their defenses and were able to resist the attacks of the Kurds for five days. Father Armalet cites two different versions about the role of the Ottoman army: In the first one, the army aided the Kurds in attacking the monastery, killing 70 Assyrians. The governor then sent 30 soldiers who accompanied the besieged to their villages and provide them with protection. In the second version, which agrees with the official story, the Kurds attacked the monastery on their own, the Mutasarrif sent a force which ordered the Kurds to withdraw, when they did not the Ottoman force attacked them and killed 80 men. Historians agree that the town of Jezireh east of Tur Abdin, stayed calm and secure during the massacres, however, villages around Midyat were not spared from the destruction and killings. and tells the monk Dominican friar father Gallant witnessed scenes of destruction as he passed in these areas in 1896. The Assyrian population of the Sanjak of Mardin declined sharply after the massacres. In an estimate prior to the First World War, Christians formed roughly two-fifths of its population of 200,000. Tur Abdin had ceased to be a \\"Christian island\\" as Christians now numbered about 50% of its population of 45,000.  Stance of the Syriac Orthodox Church  Ignatius Afram I Barsoum. The official story of the Syriac Orthodox Church about the events varies considerably from views shared by historians and contemporaries. In his version of the events compiled in the 1940s, Patriarch Ignatius Ephrem I Barsoum tries to confront the official Turkish version. He mentioned that Patriarch Ignatius Abdul Masih II hurried to Diyarbakƒ±r upon hearing the news of an Armenian massacre and sent a telegram to the Sultan obtaining an order to protect the Assyrians. He then goes to compare the Church to Noah's Ark, for being a shelter of its sons. In father Armalet's version, the Patriarch sent a messenger to the governor, but he was killed, the message however reached the governor who asked for the Patriarch to meet him. The latter crossed the city, walking over the corpses of dead Christians. The governor then welcomed him and asked him to take refuge with his followers in the main Assyrian church of the city. According to an oral tradition, the massacres caused the patriarch to lose his mind and he started drinking after he returned to Mardin and was later deposed. He then went to Kerala in India where he nominated new bishops, resulting in a schism among Saint Thomas Christians that still exists. According to Patriarch Barsoum, Tur Abdin was also spared when two Assyrian notables sent a request for protection from the Ottoman authorities in Diyarbakƒ±r. The governor later sent a force that expelled the Kurds and guarded the villages until April 1896. Several sources mention that the Ottoman authorities had forced the senior clerics, including the Patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church to sign official documents stating that the chaos was caused by an Armenian revolt. This led to a widespread contempt among Christians who occupied churches and prevented the clergy from celebrating the mass. Some priests were even manhandled by them. This was one of the reasons put forward by the Ottoman authorities to justify some of the killings.

It is a positive-strand DNA virus with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). CTXœÜ infects some strains of Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium that causes cholera. It carries the genes for cholera toxin (CTX), which makes cholera especially virulent. It can carry genes from one V. cholerae strain to another. Genetic material CTXœÜ is generally present integrated into the genome of the V. cholerae bacterium, and more rarely in a virion form outside the bacterium. While integrated into the bacterial genome, CTX prophages are found on each of the two chromosomes (in the O1 serogroup of V. cholerae) or arranged in tandem on the larger chromosome (in the El Tor biotype of V. cholerae). The genome of CTXœÜ is 6.9 kb long and consists of two regions. The core region contains genes that code for CTX itself and some proteins that are presumed to form the outside coat of the virus. The RS2 region contains genes that control the replication, regulation, and integration of CTXœÜ. Insertion, replication, and release from host cell The insertion of the CTXœÜ genetic material into the V. cholerae bacterium is mediated by two receptors. The first is the toxin- coregulated pilus (TCP), which also aids the bacterium in adhering to the intestinal cell wall. The TCP is thought to bind to the minor CTXœÜ coat protein OrfU. The second is the TolQRA membrane protein structure. These requirements for phage membrane binding are quite similar to those of the Ff bacteriophage, which infects the bacterium Escherichia coli and requires the F pilus along with the TolQRA structure. In E. coli, the TolQRA acts to translocate the Ff phage into the periplasmic space, where a possible membrane fusion event leads to the insertion of the Ff genome into the E. coli cytoplasm. A similar mechanism is suspected in the injection of the CTXœÜ genetic material into the V. cholerae cell, though further research is needed to confirm this. After ssDNA insertion into the V. cholerae cytoplasm, a complementary strand of DNA is formed in order to create the plasmid form of the viral genome, pCTX. pCTX can undergo DNA replication to create new ssDNA genomes and/or be incorporated into the bacterial genome as a prophage. Because this prophage can be present in tandem in some biotypes of V. cholerae, horizontal gene transfer and vertical transmission of the added CTXœÜ genes are not mutually exclusive. After the production of the proteins and genomic material necessary to create new virion forms of the bacteriophage, the proteins assemble at a membranous protein complex, the EpsD secretin. Once the new ssDNA genome is inside the assembled proteins, the CTXœÜ virion detaches from the EpsD and is free to infect other bacteria. Phage particles are secreted from bacterial cells without lysis. Non-CT toxins Recent research suggests that at least two toxins other than CT are produced from genes of the CTXœÜ genome. The first of these is accessory cholera enterotoxin (Ace). Ace is currently thought to be a minor coat protein of virion stage CTXœÜ, though the process by which the toxin could be released from the protein coat has not yet been identified. The second non-CT toxin encoded within the CTXœÜ genome is zonula occludens toxin (Zot). Zot, though absolutely essential for the production of the CTXœÜ virion, is not actually present in the phage particle. The part that Ace and Zot play in the virulence of cholera is still quite unclear.

Etymology There are two slightly differing, but related, etymologies for the origin of the term: One common etymology is that BIGOT is a reversal of the codewords \\"TO GIB\\", meaning \\"To Gibraltar\\". The context of this etymology is the Allied invasion of North Africa in November 1942: \\"TO GIB\\" was stamped on the orders of military and intelligence staff travelling from Britain to North Africa to prepare for the operation. The majority of personnel made a dangerous journey by sea, through areas patrolled by German U-boats, however certain individuals whose contribution to the campaign or whose mission was vital were classified \\"BIGOT\\", and were flown to Africa on a safer route via Gibraltar. Several sources state that BIGOT was a codeword for Operation Overlord, the Western Allies' plan to invade German-occupied western Europe during World War II, and that the term was an acronym for \\"British Invasion of German Occupied Territory\\". However, the term \\"BIGOT\\", used to designate the highest level of military secrecy, appeared on amphibious operations planning documents prior to Operation Overlord. See, for example, the BIGOT map created for use in Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily, which took place in 1943, preceding Operation Overlord, which occurred in 1944. This map is referenced on the British Imperial War Museum site. It is possible that the term itself, supposedly suggested by Winston Churchill, was a \\"backronym\\"‚Äîa phrase created to fit an acronym such as the existing \\"To Gibraltar\\" code. The list of personnel cleared to know details of Overlord was known as the BIGOT list, and the people on it were known as \\"Bigots\\". The details of the invasion plan were so secret, adherence to the list was rigidly enforced. U.S. military advisor George Elsey tells a story in his memoirs about how a junior officer turned away King George VI from the intelligence centre on the , because, as he explained to a superior officer \\"...nobody told me he was a Bigot.\\" Although both derivations are of British origin, the term is widely used in the United States intelligence agencies.

In particular, his recent discovery of \\"Zero magneto resistance in polymer nanofibers\\" is his most important and seminal achievement. There has been no such material reported in the history of material sciences in the world.A. Choi, H. J. Lee, A. B. Kaiser, S. H. Jhang, S. H. Lee, J. S. Yoo, K. H. S., Y. W. Nam, S. J. Park, H. N.

Park, Chemical Society Reviews, 39, 2428 (2010) Due to the quenching of orbital motion in the reduced dimension, i.e. the quasi-one-dimensional nature of polymer nanofibers, the intrinsic spin of charge carriers responds to the external field. For this reason, one could probe both spin and charge of the charge carriers (not being dominated by the orbital motion) in the polymer nanofibers by measuring the magneto resistance (MR). The MR vanishes at high electric field remaining zero all the way from H = 0 to 35 tesla in polyacetylene nanofibers. Other conducting polymers such as polyaniline nanofibers and polythiophene nanofibers do not show the zero MR. Instead, they show positive MR which increases more than 50% as the magnetic field increases to 35 tesla. The zero magneto resistance in polyacetylene nanofibers is understood to be caused from the spinless charge carriers tunneling in high electric field in the quasi-one-dimensional nanofibers. There would be tremendous applicability of the zero MR characteristics of polymer nanofibers. For example, the high speed magnetic levitation train can be stabilized by using the zero MR switching device made of polymer nanofibers.

At its southern end, the street branches from Telegraph Avenue in Oakland's Temescal district, then ends at Indian Rock Park in the Berkeley Hills to the north. Shattuck Avenue is the main street of Berkeley, forming the spine of that city's downtown, and the site of the Gourmet Ghetto in North Berkeley. The street was named for Francis Kittredge Shattuck, an early landowner and booster who later served as Mayor of Oakland. Shattuck was largely responsible for the original construction of the road as well as for a railroad built along its route. History During the Mexican era, a trail or road ran between the homes of the Peralta brothers, Domingo and Vicente. Domingo made his home along Codornices Creek near what is today the intersection of Sacramento and Hopkins Streets in Berkeley. Vicente's home was situated along Temescal Creek near what is today the intersection of 55th Street and Telegraph Avenue in North Oakland. The route of this early predecessor road, which came to be called the \\"Temescal Road\\",\\"The Story of the Hanging Oak\\", John Boyd, Berkeley Gazette, January 14, 1908 is depicted on the first official plat map of the area, Kellersberger's Map. A trace of it survives today as Racine Avenue in North Oakland. During the 1850s, Francis Shattuck and three others laid claim to four adjoining strips of land in what is now downtown Berkeley. The dividing line between the parcels claimed by Shattuck and his brother-in-law George Blake became the alignment of a new county road whose construction the Board of Supervisors assigned to Francis Shattuck, a member of the board. The new road was laid out from where Strawberry Creek intersected the old Temescal Road, thence along the new alignment, extending southward to a gore point intersection with the Telegraph Road (today's Telegraph Avenue). The road became known as \\"Shattuck's Road\\". Francis Shattuck built his new home above the north bank of Strawberry Creek at the northern terminus of the county road, which was also the northern bound of Shattuck's claim, along the alignment of what is now Addison Street. The creek and Shattuck's home were situated along what is now Allston Way. In 1866, the College Homestead Association, an organization established to raise funds for the new site of the College of California, filed a plat map with the object of selling parcels of land near the site of the present University of California. This map proposed names for several streets in a grid pattern, incorporating the alignment of Shattuck's Road, but designating it \\"Guyot Street\\". The name never stuck. By the time of the incorporation of the Town of Berkeley in 1878, Shattuck's Road had become Shattuck Avenue. By that time also, it had been extended northward to Rose Street. Additionally, the Central Pacific, at Shattuck's urging, had constructed its Berkeley Branch Railroad which merged into Shattuck at Adeline Avenue. In later years, this line was assigned to the Southern Pacific and eventually electrified and extended. Streetcars and transbay trains of the competing Key System also ran on Shattuck in Berkeley. Overview In North Berkeley, Shattuck Avenue is the location of the Gourmet Ghetto, an unofficial district known for its density of restaurants. From there the street leads south to Downtown Berkeley. Shattuck is an important north‚Äìsouth arterial roadway for northern Alameda County connecting the downtowns of Berkeley and Oakland. In the early 20th century the road included commuter train and streetcar tracks.Downtown Berkeley Association - About Downtown Berkeley Today BART carries commuters on the system's second-most popular line underneath the pavement. This includes the Ashby and Downtown Berkeley stations. The Downtown Berkeley is one of BART's most frequented stations and a transit hub for AC Transit and Bear Transit buses. Furthermore, AC's 1R BRT line terminates at this location. The street is used to access the major employers and educational institutions located along it including the University of California, Berkeley City College, Berkeley High School, CALPIRG, the PowerBar headquarters and other downtown office towers. The downtown length is home to many anchor and small retailers in addition to being a bustling restaurant district. The street is a major gathering place for protestors as it is effectively the city's Main Street and connects with other major arterials including Ashby Avenue, University Avenue, and Telegraph Avenue. It was also the site of the Berkeley Marine Corps Recruiting Center protests and features a pink-colored curb reserved for protesting parking. Further south the street is the home to La Pe√±a Cultural Center, the nation's Chilean American cultural capitol.La Pe√±a Turns Thirty with a Street Fair, Patrick Hodge, San Francisco Chronicle, 11-06-2005, 05-01-2012.

Some railways, primarily in the northeast, used standard gauge of ; others used gauges ranging from to . As a general rule, southern railroads were built to one or another broad gauge, mostly , while northern railroads that were not standard-gauge tended to be narrow-gauge. The Pacific Railroad Acts of 1863 specified standard gauge. Thirty-Seventh Congress Session III Chap CXII March 3, 1863 Retrieved on 2019-01-08. Notable exceptions were the railroads that predominated in the first part of the 19th century in New York State, and the lines centered on Portland, Maine. Problems began as soon as lines began to meet, and standard gauge was adopted in much of the northeastern U.S. Standard gauge had spread widely across the country by the late 19th century except in some parts of the South; it was adopted there in a two-day changeover on May 31-June 1, 1886. Today, standard gauge is used almost everywhere in the U.S. Non-standard gauges remain in use only for some municipal and regional mass transit systems not requiring interchange of equipment. Broad gauges  gauge  The New York and Erie Railroad was originally gauge, and spawned a regional network of other six foot gauge railroads within New York State. Chartered in 1832, its first section opening in 1841, the Erie's promoters and early engineers believed it would be so busy that wider gauged tracks would be required for locomotives much larger (and therefore more powerful) than usual to pull the expected very long and heavy trains. 6 ft gauge was also cited for improved stability, and the New York and Erie eventually had rolling stock with wide loading gauge. Other railroads connecting to the Erie were soon built, able to interchange freight and passenger cars, forming a true regional six foot gauged railroad network across southern tier of New York State from the Hudson River to the shores of Lake Erie. Major cities including Rochester, Syracuse, Utica, and Albany all were connected by six foot gauged railroads extending from Elmira and Binghamton on the New York and Erie mainline. These lines included the Avon, Genesee & Mt. Morris, the Albany and Susquehanna (later part of the Delaware and Hudson), the Elmira, Jefferson & Canandaigua (later the Northern Central, becoming part of the Pennsylvania Railroad), the Rochester & Genesee Valley, the Canandaigua and Niagara Falls (initially Erie controlled, later part of the New York Central railroad's Peanut Route along the shoreline of Lake Ontario), and even the mainline of rival, and future (1960) merger partner, the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western (The Lackawanna also had a significant portion of its six-foot gauge trackage in Pennsylvania and New Jersey). Other 6 ft gauge lines included the Syracuse, Binghamton & New York (later part of the Lackwanna), the Walkill Valley railroad (later part of the New York Central), and the Erie's own Newburgh branch. Between 1876 and 1880 most of the 6 ft lines converted to standard gauge, some having been first dual gauged with a third running rail allowing standard gauge trains to share the track, prior to the removal of the 6 ft rails.http://www.crookedlakereview.com/articles/136_150/147apr2008/147palmer3.html  gauge Portland gauge of was used on the Grand Trunk Railway, Maine Central Railroad, and a system of connecting lines to funnel interior traffic through the port of Portland, Maine, in competition with the standard gauge railway system serving the port of Boston. The Portland Company was formed to build locomotives of this gauge for use on the local rail system. The gauge was known as \\"Texas gauge\\" while required by Texas law until 1875,HOUSTON AND TEXAS CENTRAL RAILWAY and used by the New Orleans, Opelousas and Great Western Railroad (NOO&GW;) until 1872, and by the Texas and New Orleans Railroad until 1876. The New England railways were similarly standard-gauged in the 1870s. In the 1960s, the gauge was selected for use in the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, serving the San Francisco Bay Area; it is the only place in the United States where this gauge is in use. The rapid transit segment of the system covers of double track in revenue service with additional sidings and maintenance facilities.  gauge  * Baltimore Streetcar Museum Formerly used in the MTA Maryland. * United Railways and Electric Company  Pennsylvania trolley gauges  and are commonly known as Pennsylvania trolley gauge because it was originally used by railroad lines in the state of Pennsylvania.

This configuration allowed for wider rolling stock that could more efficiently accommodate cotton bales, the most commonly transported good in the South at the time. In the U. S. this gauge was changed to in 1886.Southern Railfan, The Days They Changed the Gauge This gauge remains in use by Pittsburgh's two funicular railways, the Monongahela Incline (the oldest continuously operating funicular in the United States, having opened in 1870) and the Duquesne Incline.  Most of the original track in Ohio was built in gauge, the Ohio gauge. Narrow gauges  gauge The Washington Metro system in the D.C. metropolitan area was built to narrow gauge.  gauge The world's first operational mountain-climbing cog railway (rack- and-pinion railway), the Mount Washington Cog Railway in Coos County, New Hampshire ‚Äî in operation since its opening in 1869 ‚Äî uses a 4 ft 8 inch (1,422 mm) rail gauge, as designed by Sylvester Marsh, the creator of the Marsh rack system for ensuring firm traction going up and down the slopes of the highest mountain in New England.  gauge The San Francisco cable cars use the Cape Gauge of , as did the Los Angeles Railway and the San Diego Electric Railway until 1898, and that gauge is still widely used in the U.S. mining industry.  gauge gauge railways became the dominant narrow gauge throughout the United States from the Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad of Massachusetts to the Pacific Coast Railway of California. The gauge was also used by the Oahu Railway and Land Company of Hawaii, the White Pass and Yukon Route of Alaska and the dormant East Broad Top Railroad of Pennsylvania. Heritage railroads operate portions of the formerly extensive Colorado system as the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad and Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad.  gauge The Angels Flight and Court Flight funicular railways of Los Angeles used . The gauge was also used for the Yosemite Short Line Railway, the Pacific Coast Steamship Company's horse-powered tramway near Pismo Beach, California, Michigan's Harbor Springs Railway, and several Hawaiian sugar plantation railways. This became a popular gauge for heritage railways in California, Florida, Hawaii, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon, and Pennsylvania.  gauge Several Maine railroads used gauge following demonstration on the Billerica and Bedford Railroad in 1877, including the Sandy River and Rangeley Lakes Railroad, the Wiscasset, Waterville and Farmington Railway, the Kennebec Central, the Monson Railroad, and the Saco Biddeford & Harrison (later the Biddeford & Harrison). When these railroads ceased operation in the 1930s and 1940s, much of their equipment was transferred to the Edaville Railroad, which, as of 2019, remains in operation as one of the oldest American heritage railroads. Also as of 2019, the Maine Narrow Gauge Railroad Museum; Sandy River and Rangeley Lakes Railroad; Wiscasset, Waterville and Farmington Railway; and Boothbay Railway Village also continue to operate old Maine gauge equipment. The gauge was also used by the Mount Gretna Narrow Gauge Railway in Pennsylvania, and by some mining railways of the Rocky Mountains. Similar gauge equipment, which was originally manufactured for the trench railways of World War I, was used on United States military bases in Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, New Jersey, and Oklahoma through World War II; and sold as military surplus for earth-moving construction through the 1920s. Towards standardization In the early days of rail transport in the United States, railroads tended to be built out of coastal cities into the rural interior and hinterland and systems did not connect. Each builder was free to choose its own gauge, although the availability of British-built locomotives encouraged some railroads to be built to standard gauge. When American railroads' track extended to the point that they began to interconnect, it became clear that a single nationwide gauge would be a good idea. Where different gauges meet, there is a \\"break of gauge\\". To overcome this issue, special compromise cars were able to run and standard gauge track. Another application was the Ramsey car-transfer apparatus. Gauge war In Erie, Pennsylvania, the Erie Railroad terminated while adjacent railroads used gauge, also known as \\"Ohio gauge.\\" This led to the Erie Gauge War in 1853‚Äì54 when the Erie mayor and citizens temporarily prevented a gauge standardization, as there would then be less trans-shipping work and through passengers would no longer have a stopover at Erie. Pacific Railway Act of 1863 Break of gauge would prove to be a nightmare during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì65), often hindering the Confederacy's ability to move goods efficiently over long distances. The Pacific Railway Act of March 3, 1863, specified that the federally funded transcontinental railroad was to use standard gauge and helped to further popularize it among American railroads, although the standard gauge was already in use on many other lines prior to 1863. Pressure for standardization Following the Civil War, trade between the South and North grew sufficiently large that the break of gauge became a major economic nuisance, impeding through shipments. Competitive pressures induced most North American railways to convert to standard gauge by 1880, but Southern railroads remained on its distinct, 5 ft. (1,524 mm) gauge. In 1884 and 1885, two important railroads connecting Chicago to the South (the Illinois Central and the Mobile and Ohio Railroad) converted to standard gauge, increasing pressure on competing and connecting lines to do the same. Unification to standard gauge on May 31 ‚Äì June 1, 1886 In 1886, the southern railroads agreed to coordinate changing gauge on all their tracks. After considerable debate and planning, most of the southern rail network was converted from gauge to gauge, then the standard of the Pennsylvania Railroad, over two days beginning on Monday, May 31, 1886. Over a period of 36 hours, tens of thousands of workers pulled the spikes from the west rail of all the broad gauge lines in the South, moved them east and spiked them back in place. The new gauge was close enough that standard gauge equipment could run on it without problem. By June 1886, all major railroads in North America, an estimated , were using approximately the same gauge. To facilitate the change, the inside spikes had been hammered into place at the new gauge in advance of the change. Rolling stock too was altered to fit the new gauge at shops and rendezvous points throughout the South. The final conversion to true standard gauge took place gradually as track was maintained. Now, the only broad-gauge rail systems in the United States are some city transit systems. Effects of the Southern gauge change Using historical freight traffic records, recent research has shown that the conversion to standard gauge instigated a large shift of North‚ÄìSouth freight traffic away from coastal steamships to all-rail carriage. These effects were especially strong on short routes, where breaks in gauge were more expensive relative to the total cost and duration of carriage. However, the data indicate that the gauge change had no effect on total shipments, likely as a result of anticompetitive conduct by Southern freight carriers which prevented the railroads' cost-savings from being passed through to their prices. This research suggests that had Southern carriers not been colluding, the gauge change would have generated a sharp reduction in freight rates and immediate growth in trade between the North and South.

She also obtained a Master's degree in Educational Psychology master's degree (1937) in educational psychology and her Ph.D. (1943) in human development. In 1960, Neugarten was the first person at the University of Chicago to gain tenure in the field of Human Development and began many studies on the Lifespan and Human Aging. Neugarten was one of the first to look deep within the field of aging. Neugarten was the first to teach ‚ÄúAdult Development and Aging‚Äù and she continued to teach it for 30 years. For years, it was the only course of its kind offered. This course was a model for other universities. She also broke many stereotypes about aging, such as the midlife crisis, menopause being a necessarily traumatic experience, and the empty nest syndrome. Her research dispelled the notion of a midlife crisis and showed that there was no single successful route into aging. She also critiqued stage and stepwise models of adult development and emphasized the role of chance in determining adult careers. In her work on successful aging, she argued for a more complex and heterogeneous view of older person. In particular, the \\"young old\\" (in their 60s) were often quite active and socially involved, sometimes moving back into cities or otherwise making new lives for themselves once their children were grown and on their own.Anahad O'Connor (30 July 2001). \\"Dr. Bernice L. Neugarten, 85, Early Authority on the Elderly\\", New York Times. Following her retirement from the University of Chicago, Bernice was invited to found a doctoral program in human development and social policy at Northwestern University's School of Education and Social Policy. She later returned to the University of Chicago as a Rothschild Distinguished Scholar at the Center on Aging, Health, and Society. Neugarten was recognized by numerous professional organizations and government agencies. She was president of the American Gerontological Society, and a member of the National Advisory Council of the National Institute on Aging. She was named a member of the Technical Committee on Research and Demonstration for the 1971 White House Conference on Aging and was an organizer of the follow-up White House conference in 1982.\\"Professor Emeritus Neugarten dies at 85\\", The University of Chicago Chronicle, September 20, 2001, Vol. 21 No. 1. The coauthor or editor of eight books and the author of more than 150 journal articles, Neugarten was well recognized in the research community. She died in her apartment in Hyde Park, Chicago on Sunday, July 22, 2001 at the age of 85. Her husband, Fritz Neugarten, predeceased her in 1990.  Awards and distinctions  Bernice Neugarten was president of The Gerontological Society of America starting in 1969. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1980. She also served a term on the United States Federal Council on Aging twelve years later in 1981. Neugarten was also a key contributor in the 1971 and 1982 White House Conferences on Aging. Neugarten received the Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in Psychology in 1996 from the American Psychological Association. This award was one of her biggest achievements. The award recognizes an individual's distinguished career and long lasting contributions to the use of psychology in the public interest. In 1972 Neugarten received the ‚ÄúRobert W. Kleemeier Award‚Äù for her excellence in the field of gerontology and in 1975 Neugarten received the ‚ÄúDistinguished Contribution to Education in Psychology Award.‚Äù The University of Chicago also named an award after Neugarten to honor her contributions in the field of aging.

It is a program of the California Department of Public Health which administers contracts with 84 local agencies ‚Äì half local governments and half private, non-profit community organizations ‚Äì which serve 1.46 million participants at 650 local sites statewide (The majority of participants are Latino (78%), Caucasian (8%), African-American (5.5%), Asian (5%), and Native American (<1%)), with FY 2010 food expenditures of $827 million and nutrition services and administration expenditures of $304 million.USDA, \\"WIC Program: Foodcost\\" , 2011  Organizational Structure  The Department of Health Services WIC Branch is in charge of administering all WIC funds. It allocates the funds to local agencies. Agencies receive about $100/year per participant enrolled for nutrition services and administrative expenditures (exclusive of the food budget); thus an agency serving 25,000 participants receives approximately $2,500,000 from the state to run all services related to nutrition services and administration of the program.Whaley & True, \\"California WIC and Proposition 10: Made for Each Other\\" , UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families and Communities, 2000 Approximately 3,000 local WIC staff members assess and document program eligibility based on residency, income, and health or nutrition risk, and issue 7 million food checks each month. Each check is valid for a 30-day period and is payable for a specific type and quantity of food. The retail value of the checks is about $60 per month per participant.Van Eyken, M. \\"California WIC Program at a Glance\\", 2011 A local WIC site ‚Äì whether a permanent clinic, a small storefront, or a folding table in a firehouse or church basement ‚Äì is a fixture of nearly every small town, low-income neighborhood, and reservation in California. Local WIC agencies run WIC sites which are also called clinics. WIC agencies are evenly divided between those based in 48 county public health programs and 52 non-profit providers, some of which operate programs in more than one county. However, non-profit contractors serve the majority of WIC participants in the state. Local agencies range in size from small rural or neighborhood sites serving less than 1,000 to large urban agencies, such as one with a caseload of 316,825 participants, dwarfing most state WIC agencies.Van Eyken, M. \\"California WIC Program at a Glance\\", 2011  History/Special Interest Groups  California followed the basic federal WIC regulations until the early 1990s, when the state‚Äôs program spending suddenly spiked. This sudden increase in WIC involvement and spending occurred because two major stakeholders began influencing California WIC policy: the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation (CRLA) and the California WIC Association. The individual efforts of these two organizations broadened the user base for WIC and pushed forward further welfare legislation within the state. CRLA is a nonprofit organization created to give legal services to migrant workers and other impoverished peoples in California who cannot afford legal aid. Founded in 1966, the organization‚Äôs mission is to ‚Äústrive for economic justice and human rights on behalf of California's rural poor‚Äù.J.R. Padilla, \\"About Us\\", 2011 As part of a national study, in 1991 the CRLA conducted a Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project (CHHIP). CHHIP researchers discovered that 52 percent of migrant workers surveyed were not on WIC because they did not think they were eligible.California Rural Legal Assistance Association \\"Hunger in the Heartland\\" , 1991 The CRLA recommended that the California WIC program be expanded to include all eligible women and children in the state, even undocumented migratory workers. In the report‚Äôs concluding statements, researcher Gail Feenstra said, ‚ÄúThe choice is ours: hunger can either be alleviated and prevented, or allowed to fester. If we do not invest in prevention, we will pay a much higher price in the years ahead.‚Äù The organization argued that although this would cause a tax increase for Californians, in the long run the increased WIC costs would combat extreme costs through other welfare programs like MediCal. They reasoned that if the impoverished are not malnourished as children, then when they grow up they will avoid many of the health problems that would force them to turn to welfare as adults. In 1992, just after the CRLA released this report, WIC agencies throughout the state banded together to create the California WIC Association (CalWIC). According to its website, this nonprofit organization ‚Äúrepresents all parties interested in the operation of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)‚Äù.California WIC Association \\"Public Health Services\\" , Orange County Health Care Agency, 2011 Since its creation, CalWIC has actively supported legislation that improves the quality of the WIC program.

He obtained the KOSEF Science and Technology Award in 2001 for his work on the synthesis and crystal structure of mesoporous silica.http://kosef.nextdata.co.kr/index.jsp?filename=C0012/2001_10_A.htm Ryoo obtained his bachelor's degree from Seoul National University in 1977,KAIST: Professor Ryong Ryoo his master's from KAIST in 1979, and his doctorate from Stanford University in 1986. After completing his master's degree, he worked for three years at the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute. After returning to Korea in 1986, he took a position with KAIST and has remained there since. In 2006, Ryoo and his research team announced the discovery of a form of zeolite that can catalyze petrochemical reactions much more effectively than previous zeolites. Because of the potential of this to streamline the gasoline refining process, it was greeted as a \\"magical substance\\" by the South Korean press. Education Ryoo graduated Suwon High School, then graduated with a bachelor's degree in applied chemistry from the Seoul National University. He received his PhD in chemistry from Stanford University in 1985 under the supervision of Prof. Michel Boudart. His PhD thesis is Platinum Clusters in Y-Zeolite ‚Äì Studies by Physical and Chemical Probes. Prior to the PhD course, Ryoo worked at Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute as a researcher. Work After obtaining his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1986, Ryoo worked at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (U. C. Berkeley) as a Postdoctoral Fellow. He studied solid-state NMR under the supervision of Prof. Alex Pines (Jan. 1986 ‚àº Nov. 1986). Then he moved to the Department of Chemistry at KAIST as a professor (Dec. 1986). During his research at KAIST, Ryoo laid scientific cornerstones on nanoporous carbon and hierarchically nanoporous zeolite materials science. He developed a hard- templating synthesis strategy toward nanoporous carbon material and its application to the research field of fuel cells. This synthesis strategy is being evaluated as a creative and innovative approach for synthesis of not only nanoporous carbon, but also other nanoporous materials such as zeolites, polymers and metal oxides. In addition, Ryoo has been focusing on the synthesis of hierarchically nanoporous zeolite materials and their catalytic applications. In this work, he proposed several innovative synthesis strategies in porous materials preparation. He reported the organosilane- directed synthesis route to the mesoporous zeolites. Ryoo also released an article on the synthesis of single-unit-cell thick nanosheet zeolites. In this approach, a surfactant chemically incorporating a zeolite structure-directing head group was used, which can generate zeolite micropores as well as mesoporous structures simultaneously in a single synthesis step. Ryoo received the Breck Award from the International Zeolite Association in 2010. In 2011, he extended the surfactant-directing synthesis strategy to various nanoporous structures such as hexagonal honeycomb and disordered nanosponge, rather than lamellar-type nanosheet, and reported these results in Science (2011). Since 2007, Ryoo has been named National Honor Scientist by the Korean Government and has received research funds. In addition, he became a distinguished professor in the Department of Chemistry at KAIST in 2008. He is a fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, and member of the Editorial Board for both Chemical Communications and ChemCatChem.

Design and naming In January 1905 Union Steam Ship Company designed and entered into a contract with D.J. Dunlop and Co of Port Glasgow to build a new steamship. It was to be similar to the Navua which had been specially built for the tropical passenger and cargo service. The Navua had been particularly successful for the company. The new steamer was slightly larger than the Navua, but her passenger accommodation and cargo arrangements were similar. The company expected the steamer to be in service by the end of 1905. It was planned to use it on the Wellington ‚Äî West Coast route. Because of this the company asked the Premier Richard Seddon to suggest a name or names for the vessel. Of the several names he put forward, Arahura was chosen. Arahura is a small river on the West Coast.Shipping Telegrams, Taranaki Herald, Volume LIV, Issue 12772, 1 February 1905, Page 4 The papers of the day described the new ship as 320 ft long, 44 ft broad, and 28 ft 8.5 in deep.

After leaving Auckland the Arahura immediately ran into bad weather, which became steadily worse. In the Bay of Plenty a strong gale and mountainous seas were encountered. The vessel laboured badly on Saturday night and by Sunday morning had sprung a leak. Nine feet of water was reported in the forward holds. Captain Dryden decided to make for shelter and fetched up off Whangaparae, Cape Runaway at 12 pm. Her pumps were started and were easily able to cope with the leak. The vessel rode out the storm and left to come on to Gisborne at 4 am Monday morning arriving in the bay at 2:45 pm. Apart from the leak and damaged cargo the Arahua was unaffected. Some of the mail, especially those for Napier were damaged along with the sugar and a large quantity of the balance of the cargo. Because of the leak all passengers and cargo were offloaded at Gisborne and the ship sailed back to Auckland for repair on the Tuesday.Arahura Tempest Tossed, Evening Post, Volume XCI, Issue 115, 16 May 1916, Page 2 Tragedy of the Progress In May 1931 the steamer Progress was blown on to rocks after losing power.

Retrieved 6 Dec 2011. History The Witoto people were once composed of 100 villages or 31 tribes, but disease and conflict have reduced their numbers. At the early 20th century, Witoto population was 50,000. The rubber boom in the mid-20th century brought diseases and displacement to the Witotos, causing their numbers to plummet to 7,000‚Äì10,000. The rubber boom also increased outside interest in the caucho extraction due to the surge in production and demand. In the Witoto region, Julio Cesar Arana was one of the main figures of the rubber industry. He founded the Peruvian Amazonian Company, a business that extracted and sold Amazonian caucho rubber. The company relied on indigenous, including Witoto, labor, and he kept his workers in unending servitude through constant debt and physical torture. His practices had such a large negative impact on the surrounding indigenous nations that, by the time the company‚Äôs work ended, indigenous populations in the area had declined by more than half of their original numbers. Since the 1990s, cattle ranchers have invaded Witoto lands, depleted the soil, and polluted the waterways. In response to the incursions, the Colombian government established several reservations for Witotos. Subsistence Witoto peoples practice swidden or slash-and-burn agriculture. To prevent depleting the land, they relocate their fields every few yields. Major crops include cacao, coca, maize, bitter and sweet manioc, bananas, mangoes, palms, pineapples, plaintains, sugar cane, sweet potatoes, and yams. Tobacco and peanuts are also cultivated in small quantities. Ethnobotanists have studied Witoto agriculture due to its efficiency and sustainability. Witoto men hunt with blowguns and shotguns.  Cultural aspects  Traditionally, the Witoto people lived according to their patrilineal lineage. This practice is less common today, although some elders in the community continue the tradition. They live in communal houses known as joforomo or maloca that several families share. Every family has an independent sector where they can hang their hammocks. Their diets consist mainly of Casabe, arepas made with yuca brava flour, and protein from hunting and fishing. Witoto women body painting In their maloca, men have a specific place where they can consume an ancestral green powder called mambe, or jiibie. This powder is made from coca leaves and the ashes of yarumo. Traditionally, when Witoto men consume mambe they play drums called Maguare, which can be heard kilometers away. The purpose of these drums are to communicate with nearby tribes.

It lives in the Southeast Pacific along the entire coast of Chile and southern Peru. Locally, it is known as ' (literally, frog-fish). It inhabits shallow waters, including the intertidal zone. It can often be seen on exposed rocks above water, where it is able to breathe via the branchial surfaces and the skin. As long as it is kept moist by the splash of the wave action, it can survive for up to three days on land. Together with Chorisochismus dentex of southern Africa, it is the largest species of clingfish at up to long. Habitat The fish is characteristic of vertical rock walls in the middle and upper rocky intertidal community along the exposed coasts of Pacific coast of South America, ranging from southern Peru to southern Chile. Its niche is unique, with no known parallel development in other rocky intertidal communities. The most likely determinants of the distribution of Sicyases sanguineus are areas where vertical rocky shorelines encounter ocean swells and ample benthic prey. Sicyases sanguineus attaches by means of a large disc formed of the fused and highly modified pelvic fins, bearing small and flattened dermal papillae. The combination of suction by disc and adhesion by papillae secure the clingfish to the rock. Behavior Details of the sucking disc (Sicyases sanguineus viewed from below with mouth at top) When young, S. sanguineus is gregarious and often congregates on walls. They are alert and can detect moving objects over distances from . However, adults are quiescent and cluster on exposed rocks often well above water level. Among the many places where they can be seen are the boulder fields in Pozo Toyo and Antofagasta Bay, Chile. Feeding Sicyases sanguineus is omnivorous, feeding on a wide range of algae (brown, green and red) and many types of invertebrates (especially molluscs such as chitons, marine snails, limpets and mussels, and barnacles, but also crabs, isopods, amphipods, insect larvae and sea urchins). They only take relatively small animals. For example, they have been observed living in apparent peace with large chitons and limpets, whereas the small individuals are eaten by this clingfish. As known from some other clingfish, Sicyases sanguineus has relatively large, protruding front teeth on the upper jaw. The front teeth on the lower jaw are shorter and more chisel-like. When feeding on algae, they scrape the teeth along the rock surface, leaving distinctive marks. Other methods are used when feeding on molluscs like limpets. The most common way for the fish to connect itself to a flat smooth surface with its ventral sucker. It then repeatedly swings its head in a small arc, raking its teeth downward in strokes. A second mode in which Sicyases sanguineus feed on them is to insert its teeth on the limpet's shell and then twist. This produces a characteristic break into the shell posteriorly and anteriorly.

(2009), Systematic Classification of Recent and Fossil Conoidean Gastropods, ConchBooks, Hankenheim, Germany, 295 pp. * Genus Conus sensu stricto Linnaeus, 1758 :: Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The basic shell shape is conical to elongated conical, has a deep anal notch on the shoulder, a smooth periostracum and a small operculum. The shoulder of the shell is usually nodulose and the protoconch is usually multispiral. Markings often include the presence of tents except for black or white color variants, with the absence of spiral lines of minute tents and textile bars. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radula has an elongated anterior section with serrations and a large exposed terminating cusp, a non-obvious waist, blade is either small or absent and has a short barb, and lacks a basal spur. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the Indo- Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species eat other gastropods including cones. * Subgenus Ductoconus da Motta, 1991 ::Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The shell is obconic. The protoconch is multispiral with 2.5 whorls, and with nodules which persist on all whorls. The anal notch is fairly deep. The periostracum is tufted and the operculum is large. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The anterior section of the radula is much longer than the posterior section. The blade is short, a basal spur is present, and the barb is short. The radular tooth has serrations and a terminating cusp which are both internal. ::Geographical distribution :::The only species in this genus occurs in the Eastern Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::The only species in this genus is vermivorous (meaning that the cones prey on marine worms).

Built in 1797, it was the birthplace of James Phinney Baxter, mayor of Portland, and also home to two-term Governor of Maine Percival Baxter. The house was donated to the town by James Phinney Baxter in 1907, and opened as a museum in 1908. It is open on select weekdays from June to August. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The Baxter House stands on the west side of South Street, a short way south of the town center, and immediately north of the Baxter Memorial Library. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, a single off-center interior chimney, and clapboard siding. The (east-facing) front is symmetrical, with a central entrance flanked by short sidelight windows and pilasters, and topped by a Federal style semi-oval fan. A pair of small gabled dormers project from the roof, whose cornice has widely spaced pairs of brackets. A two-story ell extends to the rear. The house was built in 1797 by Isaac Gilkey, a local carpenter who is credited with other buildings in the South Street area. It was acquired by Doctor Elihu Baxter in 1812, and is where is youngest son, James Phinney Baxter, was born in 1831. Later 19th-century residents of the house included Dr. N. H. Cary and his daughter Annie Louise Cary, and James Phinney's son Percival. James Phinney Baxter repurchased the family in 1907, and donated it to the town, with the stipulation that a library be built on its site, and that it be preserved as a museum in honor of his father. The house was moved to its present location, just north of its original site, and the library was built in its place. James Phinney Baxter served six terms as Mayor of Portland, Maine (1893-1896 and 1904‚Äì1905) and was a leading local businessman and philanthropist. Percival Baxter served two terms as Governor of Maine, and is best known for donating most of the land for Baxter State Park. Annie Louise Cary was a well-known opera singer of the third quarter of the 19th century.

She edited Third Way for five of its first six years and \\"established its reputation as making a significant contribution to Christian social thinking.\\" Her hymn \\"Now We Sing a Harvest Song\\" is in the BBC's popular hymnal Come and Praise. Early life She was born in Winchester, Hampshire, England and was educated at Eastacre School, St Swithun's School, Winchester County High School for Girls and Eastleigh Technical College before going to work at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. In 1966 she attended the London mission of the American evangelist Billy Graham and found it life-changing. After working for the Church Army for four years, she went to All Nations Christian College for two years to train as a missionary. During this time, three of her poems were published in Making Eden Grow, an anthology published by the Scripture Union. In 1973, she joined the staff of Crusade, a Christian monthly magazine. Third Way Third Way was launched at the beginning of 1977 as a fortnightly sister magazine to Crusade to provide a biblical perspective on a wide range of issues. The new magazine reflected a growing concern amongst Evangelical Christians about social issues, particularly after the First International Congress on World Evangelization held in Lausanne, Switzerland in 1974. She joined Third Way at its launch as its assistant editor and became editor the next year, inheriting a fortnightly journal that was losing money heavily. She switched to a monthly circulation, cut costs, enlisted help from a team of volunteers and \\"brought the magazine back from the brink of closure.\\" Under her editorship, Third Way contributors included clergy who subsequently achieved high office, such as George Carey, who became Archbishop of Canterbury and N. T. \\"Tom\\" Wright who became Bishop of Durham as well as established evangelical leaders such as John Stott, David Watson and George Hoffman, the founder of Tearfund. The former British Prime Minister Edward Heath wrote an exclusive introduction to the Brandt Report, the report of the Independent Commission on international development chaired by former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt. From the United States she attracted such diverse contributors as Jim Wallis, founder of the radical movement Sojourners and Chuck Colson, the Watergate scandal conspirator who became a Christian and founded the Prison Fellowship. From developing countries, interviewees ranged from Mother Teresa to President Godfrey Binaisa of Uganda. Dr John Stott, an important leader in world Evangelicalism, said during her editorship that \\"Third Way is becoming indispensable reading for those who want to think Christianly about contemporary issues.\\" At her wedding in 1980 to John Mitchell, then-Director of the World Development Movement, John Stott said in his sermon that \\"under your editorship Third Way has been a blessing to hundreds of thousands.\\" Hymns Mitchell made an important contribution to the Jubilate Hymns word group that produced Hymns for Today's Church, the Evangelical Anglican and Free Church hymn book published in 1982. She was the only woman and the only non-ordained member of the group. Her own hymn \\"Now We Sing a Harvest Song\\" is included in the BBC's popular hymnbook Come and Praise. Later life After leaving Third Way at the end of 1982 on the birth of her first son, Mitchell continued her involvement with social issues at the national level through her active board membership of the Shaftesbury Project on Christian Involvement in Society and the London Institute for Contemporary Christianity. Mitchell moved to Washington DC in 1991 when her husband John left his job as Director of the World Development Movement to take up a job with the World Bank. For ten years, she was the volunteer administrator of the many Alpha courses, which introduce people to the basics of the Christian faith, run by Washington's Fourth Presbyterian Church. In 2008, Mitchell and her husband returned to the UK and a year later she was diagnosed with cancer.

He has exhibited internationally, including La Biennale de Montr√©al in 2000 and International Biennial of Contemporary Art of Seville in 2005.http://www.artnet.com/magazine/news/artnetnews2/artnetnews9-21-04.asp In 2008, his video, SCLPTR (2005), was included in California Video at the Getty Center, curated by Glenn Phillips.http://www.getty.edu/research/exhibitions_events/events/california_video.pdf Macdonald's videos, drawings and sculptures are informed by philosophical, musical, literary and popular references. They often depict everyday scenes while examining landscape, entropy, stillness, noise, and duration. In his essay Responsiveness Testing, Ralph Rugoff, director of the Hayward Gallery, London, writes: \\"Macdonald quietly unsettles the viewers faith about what exactly is - or is not - happening in the picture he or she is looking at. ... These pockets of uncertainty are enhanced by Macdonald‚Äôs deliberately style- less or impersonal approach to making images.\\"Rugoff, Ralph, \\"Responsiveness Testing,\\" 9,000 Pieces, published by Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, 2010  Works  Beginning in the mid 1990s, Macdonald‚Äôs early videos were single takes that captured specific, everyday events. One of his earliest works, Interval (1997), is a single channel, hand held video of a view from a high- rise building of afternoon traffic passing through two long palm tree shadows on a sunny boulevard in Los Angeles. About Interval, curator Barbara Fischer writes \\"What this work measures, ultimately, is what eludes the drivers as individuals:\\" while the drivers are on their own, personal journey, the shadows cast by the palm trees remind us of ‚Äúthe existence of the trees over a certain time, and the changing light caused by the earth‚Äôs rotation around the sun.\\"Fischer, Barbara, \\"Speed Still or Still Speed,\\" euan macdonald (everythinghappensatonce), Verlag f√ºr moderne Kunst N√ºrnberg, Nurenberg, Germany, 2005 In 1998, Macdonald shot the video House (everythinghappensatonce), a twenty-five-minute-long take of a dilapidated boat house in mid-fall into the waters of Lake Muskoka in Ontario, Canada. While the subject of the video remains still, movement ‚Äì from the lake, trees, a boat that speeds by ‚Äì is occurring all around it. Giorgio Verzotti, curator and art critic, writes that these small events act as a stage for the longer event of the eventual collapse of the house. ‚ÄúThis time frame transcends the direct experience of the event, and so the artist allows it to be purely intuited ‚Ä¶ The intuition ends up approaching the idea of an unpredictable, potentially infinite duration.‚ÄùVerzotti, Giorgio, \\"Mysterioso: The Oneiric Work of Euan Macdonald,\\" euan macdonald (everythinghappensatonce), Verlag f√ºr moderne Kunst N√ºrnberg, Nurenberg, Germany, 2005 In 2004 Macdonald worked with CN Tower project architect Ned Baldwin to produce The Tower, a public sculpture commission for The Toronto Sculpture Garden.http://www.torontosculpturegarden.com/EuanMacdonald.htm In 2006, Peter Eleey, currently chief curator at MoMA PS1 invited Macdonald to present his video, Healer (2002), in Times Square as part of The 59th Minute video series. Healer is a video portrait of an elderly, female mystic healer who emerges from orange theater curtains to stand on stage for the duration of the piece.http://creativetime.org/programs/archive/59/artist_macdonald.html In 2010, Western Bridge in Seattle, Washington presented A Little Ramble, a survey exhibition of Macdonald‚Äôs work. This included a commissioned work by the same name, a full scale installation of a large mountain top scene inspired by the Cascade Mountain Range near Seattle as well as \\"A Little Ramble\\" by the Swiss writer Robert Walser. In 2010, while living in China, Macdonald researched and produced work at a western musical instrument factory on the outskirts of Shanghai. Over the course of several weeks Macdonald developed the project 9,000 Pieces (2011), which centered on a factory machine designed to test the endurance of the pianos produced at the factory. First shown in 2011 at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, 9,000 Pieces consists of two works with the same name: a single channel HD video that frames both the testing machine and a piano as well as an artists book containing photographs of the surrounding factory environment. While in China, Macdonald was invited by Arrow Factory in Beijing to produce a site-related public artwork. For this project Macdonald produced Take The Dark Out Of The Night Time, an installation of LED architectural lighting on the Arrow Factory rooftop.

Zoo Junction is a flying junction, where multiple tracks cross one another by bridges to avoid conflict with other trains. In 1870, the Pennsylvania Railroad built the Connecting Railway from Frankford Junction to Zoo to bypass congested street running in Philadelphia. Instead of reaching the city directly from the north, the Connecting Railway turned west, crossed the Schuylkill River on the Connecting Railway Bridge (a stone arch viaduct) and then turned south to join the PRR's Main Line at Mantua Junction. Mantua was a wye junction controlled by three manual signal boxes; there was also an engine house in the center of the wye. By 1888 the Mantua Junction was at capacity. In 1910 the PRR built two duck-under tunnels to allow trains to reach the Connecting Railway without blocking the Main Line. In 1935, the interlocking reached its final form in conjunction with electrification and the construction of 30th Street Station and Suburban Station. In the crescent- shaped pocket between the junction and the river was the Philadelphia Zoo, which gave the interlocking its name.

During childhood, five doses are recommended, with a sixth given during adolescence. After three doses, almost everyone is initially immune, but additional doses every ten years are recommended to maintain immunity. A booster shot should be given within 48 hours of an injury to people whose immunization is out of date. For people with high-risk injuries who are not fully immunized, tetanus antitoxin may also be recommended. Confirming that pregnant women are up to date on tetanus immunization during each pregnancy can prevent both maternal and neonatal tetanus. The vaccine is very safe, including during pregnancy and in those with HIV/AIDS. Redness and pain at the site of injection occur in between 25% and 85% of people. Fever, feeling tired, and minor muscle pain occurs in less than 10% of people. Severe allergic reactions occur in less than one in 100,000 people. A number of vaccine combinations include the tetanus vaccine, such as DTaP and Tdap, which contain diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccines, and DT and Td, which contain diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. DTaP and DT are given to children less than seven years old, while Tdap and Td are given to those seven years old and older. The lowercase d and p denote lower strengths of diphtheria and pertussis vaccines. Tetanus antiserum was developed in 1890, with its protective effects lasting a few weeks. The tetanus toxoid vaccine was developed in 1924, and came into common use for soldiers in World War II. Its use resulted in a 95% decrease in the rate of tetanus. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses Effectiveness Decrease in tetanus deaths by age group between 1990 and 2017 Following vaccination, 95% of people are protected from diphtheria, 80% to 85% from pertussis, and 100% from tetanus. Globally deaths from tetanus in newborns decreased from 787,000 in 1988 to 58,000 in 2010, and 34,000 deaths in 2015 (a 96% decrease from 1988). In the 1940s, before the vaccine, there were about 550 cases of tetanus per year in the United States, which has decreased to about 30 cases per year in the 2000s. Nearly all cases are among those who have never received a vaccine, or adults who have not stayed up to date on their 10-year booster shots. Pregnancy Guidelines on prenatal care in the United States specify that women should receive a dose of the Tdap vaccine during each pregnancy, preferably between weeks 27 and 36, to allow antibody transfer to the fetus. All postpartum women who have not previously received the Tdap vaccine are recommended to get it prior to discharge after delivery. It is recommended for pregnant women who have never received the tetanus vaccine (i.e., neither DTP or DTaP, nor DT as a child or Td or TT as an adult) to receive a series of three Td vaccinations starting during pregnancy to ensure protection against maternal and neonatal tetanus. In such cases, Tdap is recommended to be substituted for one dose of Td, again preferably between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation, and then the series completed with Td. Specific types  The first vaccine is given in infancy. The baby is injected with the DTaP vaccine, which is three inactive toxins in one injection. DTaP protects against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus. This vaccine is safer than the previously used DTP. Another option is DT, which is a combination of diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. This is given as an alternative to infants who have conflicts with the DTaP vaccine. Quadrivalent, pentavalent, and hexavalent formulations contain DTaP with one or more of the additional vaccines: inactivated polio virus vaccine (IPV), Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate, Hepatitis B, with the availability varying in different countries. For the every ten-year booster Td or Tdap may be used, though Tdap is more expensive. Schedule Because DTaP and DT are administered to children less than a year old, the recommended location for injection is the anterolateral thigh muscle. However, these vaccines can be injected into the deltoid muscle if necessary. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends six doses in childhood starting at six weeks of age. Four doses of DTaP are to be given in early childhood. The first dose should be around two months of age, the second at four months, the third at six, and the fourth from fifteen to eighteen months of age. There is a recommended fifth dose to be administered to four- to six-year-olds. Td and Tdap are for older children, adolescents, and adults and can be injected into the deltoid muscle. These are boosters and are recommended every ten years. It is safe to have shorter intervals between a single dose of Tdap and a dose of the Td booster. =Additional doses= Booster shots are important because lymphocyte production (antibodies) is not at a constant high rate of activity. This is because after the introduction of the vaccine when lymphocyte production is high, the production activity of white blood cells will start to decline. The decline in activity of the T-helper cells means that there must be a booster to help keep the white blood cells active. Td and Tdap are the booster shots given every ten years to maintain immunity for adults nineteen years of age to sixty-five years of age. Tdap is given as a one-time, first-time-only dose that includes the tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccinations. This should not be administered to those who are under the age of eleven or over the age of sixty-five. Td is the booster shot given to people over the age of seven and includes the tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. However, Td has less of the diphtheria toxoid, which is why the \\"d\\" is lowercase and the \\"T\\" is capitalized. It is important to understand that booster shots should be administered before the age of sixty-five and that one of these booster shots should be Tdap while the rest are Td. In 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that either tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine or Tdap to be used for the decennial Td booster, tetanus prevention during wound management, and for additional required doses in the catch-up immunization schedule if a person has received at least one Tdap dose. Side effects A bump resulting from a tetanus vaccine injection Common side effects of the tetanus vaccine include fever, redness, and swelling with soreness or tenderness around the injection site (one of five people have redness or swelling). Body aches and tiredness have been reported following Tdap. Td / Tdap can cause painful swelling of the entire arm in one of 500 people. Tetanus toxoid containing vaccines (DTaP, DTP, Tdap, Td, DT) may cause brachial neuritis at a rate of one out of every 100,000 to 200,000 doses. Mechanism of action The type of vaccination for this disease is called artificial active immunity. This type of immunity is generated when a dead or weakened version of the disease enters the body, causing an immune response which includes the production of antibodies. This is beneficial because it means that if the disease is ever introduced into the body, the immune system will recognize the antigen and produce antibodies more rapidly. History The first vaccine for passive immunology was discovered by a group of German scientists under the leadership of Emil von Behring in 1890. The first inactive tetanus toxoid was discovered and produced in 1924. A more effective adsorbed version of the vaccine, created in 1938, was proven to be successful when it was used to prevent tetanus in the military during World War II. DTP (which is the combined vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) was first used in 1948, and was continued until 1991, when it was replaced with an acellular form of the pertussis vaccine due to safety concerns. Half of those who received the DTP vaccine had redness, swelling, and pain around the injection site, which convinced researchers to find a replacement vaccine. Two new vaccines were launched in 1992. These combined tetanus and diphtheria with acellular pertussis (TDaP or DTaP), which could be given to adolescents and adults (as opposed to previously when the vaccine was only given to children). In the United States, a course of tetanus vaccine is between 25 and US$50.

The regiment was raised in August 1914, and assigned to the 2nd Light Horse Brigade. The regiment fought against the forces of the Ottoman Empire, in Egypt, at Gallipoli, on the Sinai Peninsula, and in Palestine and Jordan. After the armistice the regiment eventually returned to Australia in March 1919. For its role in the war the regiment was awarded sixteen battle honours. During the inter-war years, the regiment was re-raised as a part-time unit based in the Wide Bay‚ÄìBurnett region of Queensland, adopting the designation of the \\"Wide Bay and Burnett Light Horse (QMI)\\". It was later converted to a motor regiment during the early years of the Second World War but it was disbanded in mid-1943 without having been deployed overseas. Formation The 5th Light Horse Regiment was raised in September 1914 as part of the all volunteer Australian Imperial Force, at Brisbane from volunteers from Queensland, and was assigned to the 2nd Light Horse Brigade. Light horse regiments normally comprised twenty-five officers and 497 other ranks serving in three squadrons, each of six troops.Gullett 1941, p. 54. Each troop was divided into eight sections, of four men each. In action one man of each section, was nominated as a horse holder reducing the regiment's rifle strength by a quarter.Horner and Williams, Chapter: Setting up the Light Horse All Australian Light Horse regiments used cavalry unit designations, but were mounted infantry,Gullett 1941, p. 29. and mounted exclusively on the Australian Waler horse.Gullett 1941, p. 38. Operational history Gallipoli 5th Light Horse crossing the pontoon bridge at the Ghoraniye Bridgehead On 21 December 1914, the 5th Light Horse Regiment left Sydney for Egypt, arriving on 1 February 1915. When the Australian infantry units were dispatched to Gallipoli, it was thought the terrain was unsuitable for mounted troops, and the light horse regiments remained in Egypt. However, heavy casualties amongst the Australian infantry resulted in the deployment of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade as dismounted reinforcements in May 1915. On arrival, the regiment was attached to the 1st Division, who by this stage of the campaign were fighting a defensive battle around the beachhead that had been established around Anzac Cove. The regiment was involved in several small-scale attacks. Its commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Hubert Harris was killed in action on 31 July 1915. The regiment was withdrawn in December 1915 as part of the Allied evacuation from the Gallipoli Peninsula. Sinai and Palestine Campaign Turkish guns captured by the regiment October 1916 After arriving back in Egypt, the regiment still with the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, was assigned to the ANZAC Mounted Division. Their first action was to defend the Suez Canal from an Ottoman incursion through the Sinai desert. The regiment's role was mainly patrolling the desert, and in August following the Battle of Romani, they were involved in several small battles. In December 1916, the ANZAC Mounted Division moved into Palestine, during which the regiment carried out patrols and raided Ottoman positions. On 27 March 1917, the regiment fought in the First Battle of Gaza, and after attacking the town from the rear, was fighting through the town when ordered to withdraw. They then fought in the unsuccessful Second Battle of Gaza and the Third Battle of Gaza, when the town was finally captured. The regiment was then involved in following up the retreating Ottoman forces into Palestine. In 1918, they were positioned on the River Jordan, fighting two small battles at Amman in February and Es Salt in April and May. The main British assault was on the coast, but the 5th Light Horse remained on the Jordan, attacking Amman in September. On 29 September, two of the regiment's squadrons accepted the surrender of 4,500 Ottoman soldiers. When the Armistice of Mudros was signed in October 1918, and the war in the Middle East ended, the regiment returned to Egypt, to assist in putting down a riot. Then, on 28 June 1919, the regiment sailed for Australia; their involvement in the war cost them 137 killed and 708 wounded. Perpetuation In 1921, Australia's part-time military forces were re-organised to perpetuate the numerical designations of the AIF following its demobilisation.Grey 2008, p. 125. Through this process, the 5th Light Horse was re-raised as a Citizens Forces unit within the 1st Military District in the Wide Bay‚ÄìBurnett region of Queensland. Adopting the designation of the \\"Wide Bay and Burnett Light Horse (QMI)\\", the re-raised unit drew lineage from the 1st (Central Queensland) Light Horse that had been formed in 1913 and which traced its origins back to the 13th Australian Light Horse Regiment (Queensland Mounted Infantry) that had been formed in 1903 as part of the amalgamation of Australia's colonial forces into the Australian Army after Federation.Festberg 1972, p. 42. This unit remained in existence throughout the inter-war years, and at the outbreak of the Second World War the regiment was assigned to the 11th Mixed Brigade,Finlayson 2012, p. 193. although it was later reassigned to the 1st Cavalry Brigade. In December 1941, it was converted into a motor regiment, adopting the designation of the \\"5th Motor Regiment (Wide Bay and Burnett Light Horse) (QMI)\\". In early 1943, the regiment was gazetted as an AIF unit after the majority of its personnel volunteered to serve outside of Australian territory, nevertheless, it did not serve overseas and, as part of a gradual demobilisation of the Australian Army, on 3 July 1943, it was disbanded without having seen operational service during the war.

It acts as the execution arm of the Department of Food and Civil Supplies of the Government of Kerala.Government of Kerala Official Website. 'Food & Civil Supplies Department.' Founded in 1974, the company serves the purpose of governmental intervention in the retail market to control prices of essential commodities.The Hindu. 'Move to hike Supplyco prices flayed.' The corporation runs a chain of retail supermarkets under the brand name Supplyco, and a chain of general store retail outlets under the name Maveli Stores. The Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation better Known as Supplyco is the gateway for the 30 million people of the State of Kerala, assuring the much needed food security in a substantive style by supplying life's essentials and reaching out to the rural-poor and the urban-rich alike. It was incorporated in 1974 as a fully owned government company, with authorised capital of 150 million, to meet the limited objective of regulating the market price of essential commodities at reasonable prices. The growth of Supplyco over nearly three decades was substantial, and is more expansive than similar organisations in the country. Headquartered in Trivandrum and operating through five regional offices, 14 district depots, 56 taluk depots and around 1500 retail outlets, it has a work force of more than 4500.  Market intervention  The stated purpose of Supplyco was to regulate the rise in prices of essential commodities in the open market. Under the Government programme of market intervention, pulses and spices are purchased and sold to consumers at subsidised prices fixed by the government. The Government of Kerala aids this operation by giving grants every year. The task has been fulfilled through the network of Maveli Stores, which was named to commemorate the saga of Mahabali, legendary king of Kerala. Now the Maveli Stores has become a prominent name among consumers in the state. Supplyco operates through Maveli Stores and Mobile Maveli Stores, covering almost all panchayaths. Quality products and subsidised pricing are the twin advantages, which Supplyco extend to the consumer. Supplyco has also undertaken distribution of pulses, spices and other branded products of Civil Supplies Corporation at subsidised prices, through a network of 2000 selected ration shops. Supplyco expanded to supermarkets, petrol bunks, liquefied petroleum gas outlets, and pharmacies. Supplyco also markets its own branded fast-moving consumer goods, including tea, coffee, milled wheat products, curry powders, iodised salt, bottled drinking water, rice products, coconut oil, spices under the brand name Sabari.  Festival Markets  During festival seasons like Onam, Christmas, and Ramzan, when the price of essential commodities and vegetables are highly volatile, Supplyco organises Festival Markets at important cities and other centres.  Mid-day Meal Programme  Under the Mid-Day Meal Programme of the Government, Supplyco distributes food items to 2.34 million schoolchildren, This is one of Supplyco's major operations.  Other operations  Supplyco is the sole distributor of levy sugar to the authorised ration dealers in the state. It runs 95 medical outlets in the state, which offers an average 15% discount on all medicines, with over a 25% additional discount for Below Poverty Line families. Supplyco procures paddy directly from farmers at the Minimum Support Price declared by the Government of Kerala. The procured paddy is handed over to contracted rice mills of Supplyco for milling. The resultant rice is distributed through the Public Distribution System in the state.

This theory has been analyzed by Erik Olin Wright, whose work has been cited in relation to it. According to Wright, while Marx's theory of social change is often regarded as obsolete, it is nonetheless an important and likely still the \\"most ambitious attempt to construct a scientific theory of alternatives to capitalism\\". What Marx attempted was to develop a deterministic theory of \\"long term impossibility of capitalism\\". According to Marx, the very same problems that should make capitalism fail should also provide the means for the new, more democratic and egalitarian society to arise. Theory Wright identifies five core arguments in Marx's thought. The first of these is that capitalism is an unsustainable economic system in the long run. Here, Marx claims that capitalism's replacement by another economic system is an inevitability, as through time it creates conditions in which it can no longer function. This part of Marx's argument does not predict what type of system will replace capitalism, it simply stresses the capitalist self-destructive nature. This prediction is based on four trends Marx observed: * productivity is steadily increased; * the reach of capitalism increases both in the geographical sense and in the penetration of the society (commodification); * capital tends to be increasingly concentrated; * periodic economic crises (recessions) tend to be increasingly more severe. A related, more theoretical argument that Marx made here was based on the labor theory of value (only labor produces value). Marx believed that as non-labor (and by extension of the labor theory, non-profitable) factors become increasingly important, profits will decline, eventually approaching zero. This is commonly referred to as the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. Second, Marx predicted the increase in the class struggle. Here, Marx argued that over time, the working class will grow in numbers (proletarianization), and it will also become more aware of the inefficiencies of the capitalist system (class consciousness). Third, according to Marx, when the working class and its allies would become sufficiently numerous and organized, they would challenge and overthrow the system in a revolution (world revolution). Marx assumed here that the resistance of the capitalist class would continue to the end, preventing any non-violent, democratic transformation, and thus that the transition into a post-capitalism era would require the use of violence to overcome such resistance. Next, Marx argued that a post-capitalist system would most likely be one where means of production are collectively owned and democratically controlled (socialism). This likelihood was the result of the fact that the overthrow of capitalism was to be carried out primarily by the working class, and thus after the revolution, it would be the class to hold power and thus most influential and shaping the new world order. Finally, Marx proposed the \\"communism destination thesis\\": that socialism will eventually lead to the development of a classless society, without the need for a state (stateless communism), and operating according to the principle, \\"from each according to his ability, to each according to his need\\". Praise and criticism Wright describes the theory framed by Marx as \\"brilliant, if ultimately unsatisfactory.\\" Wright outlined four major deficiencies he believed to have existed in the theory: * periodic crises (recessions) have not, so far, exhibited any clear trend of becoming increasingly severe; * class structures, rather than producing a homogenous working class, have become increasingly complex; * the working class did not become increasingly organized and powerful; and, * capitalism, even when overthrown, was not replaced by democratic socialist societies and certainly not by communism.

Treisman proposed attenuation theory as a means to explain how unattended stimuli sometimes came to be processed in a more rigorous manner than what Broadbent's filter model could account for. As a result, attenuation theory added layers of sophistication to Broadbent's original idea of how selective attention might operate: claiming that instead of a filter which barred unattended inputs from ever entering awareness, it was a process of attenuation. Thus, the attenuation of unattended stimuli would make it difficult, but not impossible to extract meaningful content from irrelevant inputs, so long as stimuli still possessed sufficient \\"strength\\" after attenuation to make it through a hierarchical analysis process. Brief overview and previous research Selective attention theories are aimed at explaining why and how individuals tend to process only certain parts of the world surrounding them, while ignoring others. Given that sensory information is constantly besieging us from the five sensory modalities, it was of interest to not only pinpoint where selection of attention took place, but also explain how we prioritize and process sensory inputs. Early theories of attention such as those proposed by Broadbent and Treisman took a bottleneck perspective. That is, they inferred that it was impossible to attend to all the sensory information available at any one time due to limited processing capacity. As a result of this limited capacity to process sensory information, there was believed to be a filter that would prevent overload by reducing the amount of information passed on for processing. Methodology Early research came from an era primarily focused upon audition and explaining phenomena such as the cocktail party effect. From this stemmed interest about how we can pick and choose to attend to certain sounds in our surroundings, and at a deeper level, how the processing of attended speech signals differ from those not attended to. Auditory attention is often described as the selection of a channel, message, ear, stimulus, or in the more general phrasing used by Treisman, the \\"selection between inputs\\". As audition became the preferred way of examining selective attention, so too did the testing procedures of dichotic listening and shadowing. =Dichotic listening= Dichotic listening is an experimental procedure used to demonstrate the selective filtering of auditory inputs, and was primarily utilized by Broadbent. In a dichotic listening task, participants would be asked to wear a set of headphones and attend to information presented to both ears (two channels), or a single ear (one channel) while disregarding anything presented in the opposite channel. Upon completion of a listening task, participants would then be asked to recall any details noticed about the unattended channel. =Shadowing= Shadowing can be seen as an elaboration upon dichotic listening. In shadowing, participants go through largely the same process, only this time they are tasked with repeating aloud information heard in the attended ear as it is being presented. This recitation of information is carried out so that the experimenters can verify participants are attending to the correct channel, and the number of words perceived (recited) correctly can be scored for later use as a dependent variable. Due to its live rehearsal characteristic, shadowing is a more versatile testing procedure because manipulations to channels and their immediate results can be witnessed in real time. It is also favored for being more accurate since shadowing is less dependent upon participants' ability to recall words heard correctly. Broadbent's filter model as a stepping stone Information processing model of Broadbent's filter Donald Broadbent's filter model is the earliest bottleneck theory of attention and served as a foundation for which Anne Treisman would later build her model of attenuation upon. Broadbent proposed the idea that the mind could only work with so much sensory input at any given time, and as a result, there must be a filter that allows us to selectively attend to things while blocking others out. It was posited that this filter preceded pattern recognition of stimuli, and that attention dictated what information reached the pattern recognition stage by controlling whether or not inputs were filtered out. The first stage of the filtration process extracts physical properties for all stimuli in parallel manner. The second stage was claimed to be of limited capacity, and so this is where the selective filter was believed to reside in order to protect from a sensory processing overload. Based upon the physical properties extracted at the initial stage, the filter would allow only those stimuli possessing certain criterion features (e.g., pitch, loudness, location) to pass through. According to Broadbent, any information not being attended to would be filtered out, and should be processed only insofar as the physical qualities necessitated by the filter. Since selection was sensitive to physical properties alone, this was thought to be the reason why people possessed so little knowledge regarding the contents of an unattended message. All higher level processing, such as the extraction of meaning, happens post-filter. Thus, information on the unattended channel should not be comprehended. As a consequence, events such as hearing one's own name when not paying attention should be an impossibility since this information should be filtered out before you can process its meaning. =Criticisms leading to a theory of attenuation= As noted above, the filter model of attention runs into difficulty when attempting to explain how it is that we come to extract meaning from an event that we should be otherwise unaware of. For this reason, and as illustrated by the examples below, Treisman proposed attenuation theory as a means to explain how unattended stimuli sometimes came to be processed in a more rigorous manner than what Broadbent's filter model could account for. * For two messages identical in content, it has been shown that by varying the time interval between the onset of the irrelevant message in relation to the attended message, participants may notice the message duplicity. * When participants were presented with the message \\"you may now stop\\" in the unattended ear, a significant number do so. * In a classic demonstration of the cocktail party phenomenon, participants who had their own name presented to them via the unattended ear often remark about having heard it. * Participants with training or practice can more effectively perceive content from the unattended channel while attending to another. * Semantic processing of unattended stimuli has been demonstrated by altering the contextual relevance of words presented to the unattended ear. Participants heard words from the unattended ear more regularly if they were high in contextual relevance to the attended message. Attenuation model of selective attention Information processing model of Treisman's Attenuation theory How attenuation occurs Treisman's attenuation model of selective attention retains both the idea of an early selection process, as well as the mechanism by which physical cues are used as the primary point of discrimination. However, unlike Broadbent's model, the filter now attenuates unattended information instead of filtering it out completely. Treisman further elaborated upon this model by introducing the concept of a threshold to explain how some words came to be heard in the unattended channel with greater frequency than others. Every word was believed to contain its own threshold that dictated the likelihood that it would be perceived after attenuation. After the initial phase of attenuation, information is then passed on to a hierarchy of analyzers that perform higher level processes to extract more meaningful content (see \\"Hierarchical analyzers\\" section below). The crucial aspect of attenuation theory is that attended inputs will always undergo full processing, whereas irrelevant stimuli often lack a sufficiently low threshold to be fully analyzed, resulting in only physical qualities being remembered rather than semantics. Additionally, attenuation and then subsequent stimuli processing is dictated by the current demands on the processing system. It is often the case that not enough resources are present to thoroughly process unattended inputs. =Recognition threshold= The operation of the recognition threshold is simple: for every possible input, an individual has a certain threshold or \\"amount of activation required\\" in order to perceive it. The lower this threshold, the more easily and likely an input is to be perceived, even after undergoing attenuation. =Threshold affectors=  Context and priming Context plays a key role in reducing the threshold required to recognize stimuli by creating an expectancy for related information. Context acts by a mechanism of priming, wherein related information becomes momentarily more pertinent and accessible ‚Äì lowering the threshold for recognition in the process. An example of this can be seen in the statement \\"the recess bell rang\\", where the word rang and its synonyms would experience a lowered threshold due to the priming facilitated by the words that precede it. Subjective importance Words that possess subjective importance (e.g., help, fire) will have a lower threshold than those that do not. Words of great individual importance, such as your own name, will have a permanently low threshold and will be able to come into awareness under almost all circumstances. On the other hand, some words are more variable in their individual meaning, and rely upon their frequency of use, context, and continuity with the attended message in order to be perceived. Degree of attenuation The degree of attenuation can change in relation to the content of the underlying message; with larger amounts of attenuation taking place for incoherent messages that possess little benefit to the person hearing them. Incoherent messages receive the greatest amounts of attenuation because any interference they might exhibit upon the attended message would be more detrimental than that of comprehensible, or complimentary information. The level of attenuation can have a profound impact on whether an input will be perceived or not, and can dynamically vary depending upon attentional demands. =Hierarchy of analyzers= The hierarchical system of analysis is one of maximal economy: while facilitating the potential for important, unexpected, or unattended stimuli to be perceived, it ensures that those messages sufficiently attenuated do not get through much more than the earliest stages of analysis, preventing an overburden on sensory processing capacity. If attentional demands (and subsequent processing demands) are low, full hierarchy processing takes place. If demands are high, attenuation becomes more aggressive, and only allows important or relevant information from the unattended message to be processed. The hierarchical analysis process is characterized by a serial nature, yielding a unique result for each word or piece of data analyzed. Attenuated information passes through all the analyzers only if the threshold has been lowered in their favor, if not, information only passes insofar as its threshold allows. The nervous system sequentially analyzes an input, starting with the general physical features such as pitch and loudness, followed by identifications of words and meaning (e.g., syllables, words, grammar and semantics). The hierarchical process also serves an essential purpose if inputs are identical in terms of voice, amplitude, and spatial cues. Should all of these physical characteristics be identical between messages, then attenuation can not effectively take place at an early level based on these properties. Instead, attenuation will occur during the identification of words and meaning, and this is where the capacity to handle information can be scarce. Evidence Following messages to the unattended ear During shadowing experiments, Treisman would present a unique stream of prosaic stimuli to each ear. Sometime during shadowing, the stimuli would then swap over to the opposite side so that the formerly shadowed message was now presented to the unattended ear. Participants would often \\"follow\\" the message over to the unattended ear before realizing their mistake, especially if the stimuli had a high degree of continuity. This \\"following of the message\\" illustrates how the unattended ear is still extracting some degree of information from the unattended channel, and contradicts Broadbent's filter model that would expect participants to be completely oblivious of the change in the unattended channel. Manipulating the onset of messages In a series of experiments carried out by Treisman (1964), two messages identical in content would be played, and the amount of time between the onset of the irrelevant message in relation to the shadowed message would be varied. Participants were never informed of the message duplicity, and the time lag between messages would be altered until participants remarked about the similarity. If the irrelevant message was allowed to lead, it was found that the time gap could not exceed 1.4 seconds. This was believed to be a result of the irrelevant message undergoing attenuation and receiving no processing beyond the physical level. This lack of deep processing necessitates the irrelevant message be held in the sensory store before comparison to the shadowed message, making it vulnerable to decay. In contrast, when the shadowed message led, the irrelevant message could lag behind it by as much as five seconds and participants could still perceive the similarity. This shows that the shadowed message is not decaying as quickly, and coincides with what attenuation theory would predict: the shadowed message receives no attenuation, undergoes full processing, and then gets passed on to working memory where it can be held for a comparatively longer duration than the unattended message in the sensory store. Variations upon this method involved using identical messages spoken in different voices (e.g., gender), or manipulating whether the message was composed of non-words to examine the effect of not being able to extract meaning. In all cases, support was found for a theory of attenuation. Bilingual shadowing Bilingual students were found to recognize that a message presented to the unattended channel was the same as the one being attended to, even when presented in a different language. This was achieved by having participants shadow a message presented in English, while playing the same message in French to the unattended ear. Once again, this shows extraction of meaningful information from the speech signal above and beyond physical characteristics alone. Electrical shock and unattended words Corteen and Dunn (1974) paired electrical shock with target words. The electric shocks were presented at very low intensity, so low that the participants did not know when the shock occurred. It was found that if these words were later presented in the absence of shock, participants would respond automatically with a galvanic skin response (GSR) even when played in the unattended ear. Furthermore, GSR's were found to generalize to synonyms of unattended target words, implying that word processing was taking place at a level deeper than what Broadbent's model would predict. Event-related potentials of irrelevant stimuli Von Voorhis and Hillyard (1977) used an EEG to observe event-related potentials (ERPs) of visual stimuli. Participants were asked to attend to, or disregard specific stimuli presented. Results demonstrated that when attending to visual stimuli, the amount of voltage fluctuation was greater at occipital sites for attended stimuli when compared to unattended stimuli. Voltage modulations were observed after 100ms of stimuli onset, consistent with what would be predicted by attenuation of irrelevant inputs. Effects of attentional demand on brain activity In a fMRI study that examined if meaning was implicitly extracted from unattended words, or if the extraction of meaning could be avoided by simultaneously presenting distracting stimuli; it was found that when competing stimuli create sufficient attentional demand, no brain activity was observed in response to the unattended words, even when directly fixated upon. These results are in keeping with what would be predicted by an attenuation style of selection and run contrary to classical late selection theory. Competing theories In 1963, Deutsch & Deutsch proposed a late selection model of how selective attention operates. They proposed all stimuli get processed in full, with the crucial difference being a filter placed later in the information processing routine, just before the entrance into working memory. The late selection process supposedly operated on the semantic characteristics of a message, barring inputs from memory and subsequent awareness if they did not possess desired content. According to this model, the depreciated awareness of unattended stimuli came from denial into working memory and the controlled generation of responses to it. The Deutsch & Deutsch model was later revised by Norman in 1968, who added that the strength of an input was also an important factor for its selection. A criticism of both the original Deutsch & Deutsch model, as well as the revised Deutsch‚ÄìNorman selection model is that all stimuli, including those deemed irrelevant, are processed fully. When contrast against Treisman's attenuation model, the late selection approach appears wasteful with its thorough processing of all information before selection of admittance into working memory.

History St. Katherine's Chapel was built in 1887 by John Harris Forster in memory of his daughter Kittie (real name Katherine) who had died in 1864 at the age of six. In 1888 Forster gave the chapel to Episcopal Diocese of Michigan and it was named St. Katherine's Chapel in memory of Kitty. In 1962, a new church was constructed nearby, but the chapel remained in use for weddings and other special events. On February 23, 1969, the chapel was designated a Michigan State Historic Site and on July 8, 1970, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The parish known today as St. Katherine's Episcopal Church is still an active parish in the Episcopal Diocese of Michigan. The Rev. Ronald Byrd, Sr., is its current rector. The chapel is still in use today for one Sunday service as well as for occasional weddings and other events. The church holds it main services in the larger church building built further back on the same property. Description St. Katherine's Chapel is a small wooden gabled Carpenter Gothic chapel measuring 21 feet by 36 feet, sitting on a concrete and rubble foundation. It is clad with vertical board and batten, with shingles in some gables. A projecting gables entryway on one end shelters a double door. A small belfry is on the roof. The interior of the chapel is rectangular, with pews on either side of a central aisle. Most of the interior is paneled with unpainted beaded pine boards. Windows on most elevation are glazed with large sheets of red, yellow, and blue glass. Cemetery Forster, his daughter and other family members and parishioners were buried on the grounds of St. Katherine's. The small cemetery which developed there is now used mainly for the burial of cremated remains.

Lawrence Broer discusses Hemingway‚Äôs fame as an objective writer,Broer, Lawrence. ‚ÄúHemingway‚Äôs ‚ÄòOn Writing‚Äô: A Portrait of the Artist as Nick Adams.‚Äù Bloom‚Äôs Major Literary Characters: Nick Adams. Harold Bloom, ed. Chelsea House Publishers, 2004, pages 87-96. but Nick says in the fragment, ‚ÄúThe only writing that was any good was what you made up, what you imagined. That made everything come true.‚Äù Vaughn notes the metafictional aspects of ‚ÄúOn Writing,‚Äù extending them, possibly, to In Our Time. However, Nick believes that an author can‚Äôt work ‚Äútoo close to life.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat was the weakness of Joyce,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúDaedalus in Ulysses was Joyce himself, so he was terrible. Joyce was so damn romantic and intellectual about him.‚Äù Because Nick is often seen as at least partially autobiographical, Hemingway may have followed his own teaching in cutting ‚ÄúOn Writing.‚Äù The fragment highlighted Nick‚Äôs drawn-out thought process, and that may have been too ‚Äúintellectual.‚Äù In addition to commenting on Joyce, Nick mentions several other writers that he has learned from, among them Gertrude Stein, E.E. Cummings, and Ezra Pound. Symbolism and Allusion Nick‚Äôs freeing the trout and helping the rabbit indicate his sensitivity as an artist. Throughout the fragment, Nick alludes to stories from In Our Time. He directly mentions writing ‚ÄúMy Old Man,‚Äù and his mention of childbirth fits scenes in ‚ÄúIndian Camp‚Äù and Chapter 2. He also mentions elements of many other stories, such as the bullfighter Maera from Chapters 13 and 14 and ruining the reality of war by talking about it, as Krebs finds in ‚ÄúSoldier‚Äôs Home.‚Äù These similarities have led to the belief that Nick is the supposed author of In Our Time. Specifically, when Nick is ‚Äúholding something in his head‚Äù at the end of ‚ÄúOn Writing,‚Äù many believe it is the story ‚ÄúBig Two-Hearted River.‚Äù Theory and implications of Nick as author of In Our Time If ‚ÄúOn Writing‚Äù had been published, our reading of the book would be significantly changed. Recognizing Nick as the author ‚Äúresolves many confusions about the book‚Äôs unity, structure, vision, and significance,‚Äù Moddelmog writes ‚Äîin short, it could be viewed as a novel instead of a short story collection. She believes that this is indeed the correct way to view the book. Following Nick‚Äôs thoughts gives us a clearer sense of the connectedness of the stories, while separating us from Hemingway‚Äôs direct narration keeps us from applying too much of Hemingway‚Äôs biography to a work of fiction. Our readings of individual stories would also be affected. ‚ÄúIndian Camp,‚Äù for example, ends with Nick, as a boy, resolving never to die, but as Paul Smith notes, viewing the young Nick through the author Nick‚Äôs eyes emphasizes that this view of death is false.Smith, Paul. ‚ÄúWho Wrote Hemingway‚Äôs In Our Time?‚Äù Bloom‚Äôs Major Literary Characters: Nick Adams. Harold Bloom, ed. Chelsea House Publishers, 2004, pages 105-112. Our views of the ‚Äúmarriage stories‚Äù would also be affected by Nick‚Äôs description of his own marriage in ‚ÄúOn Writing.‚Äù Even individual characters would be affected‚ÄîMaera, the bullfighter killed in Chapter 14 of In Our Time, is still alive in ‚ÄúOn Writing‚Äù. Effects of addition to and deletion from ‚ÄúBig Two- Hearted River‚Äù Besides implying that Nick is the author of In Our Time, including ‚ÄúOn Writing‚Äù in ‚ÄúBig Two-Hearted River‚Äù would have changed our views of Nick as a character. Moddelmog notes that we would view him as a hero: after his fear of thinking in ‚ÄúBig Two-Hearted River,‚Äù Nick leaves the stream after ‚ÄúOn Writing‚Äù ready to face his thoughts and even to write about them. ‚ÄúTo put this another way,‚Äù Moddelmog says, ‚Äúin the act of writing, Nick will have to fish that symbolic mental swamp, an effort which, in the final version of ‚ÄòBig Two-Hearted River,‚Äô he is not quite ready to make.‚Äù Including the fragment would also change the chronology of The Nick Adams Stories by referencing Nick‚Äôs marriage, placing it later after the war. However, Nick‚Äôs background doesn‚Äôt completely depend on ‚ÄúOn Writing‚Äù‚Äîhe mentions ‚Äúthe need to write‚Äù in ‚ÄúBig Two-Hearted River.‚Äù ‚ÄúOn Writing‚Äù simply expands Nick‚Äôs story and makes it available to the reader. Cutting the fragment, as Hemingway did, also has many results. Louis A. Renza explains that retaining ‚ÄúOn Writing‚Äù would draw attention to the fact that the story was writing, while omitting the piece helps hide it.Renza, Louis A. ‚ÄúThe Importance of Being Ernest.‚Äù Hemingway: Seven Decades of Criticism. Linda Wagner-Martin, ed. Michigan State University Press, 1998, pages 213-238. Flora believes that cutting ‚ÄúOn Writing‚Äù allows a greater scope of interpretation than would be encouraged with Nick as a narrator. In addition, viewing In Our Time like a novel would cause continuity problems that would otherwise be avoidable. Nick‚Äôs war wound changes, for example, which is tolerable across short stories but not through a novel. In addition, Hemingway struggled with writing in novel form; viewing In Our Time as a novel would mean that he struggled after he had already succeeded. Finally, cutting ‚ÄúOn Writing‚Äù gave Nick greater flexibility as a character. Assigning him authorship to all of In Our Time would force him to take on more and more stories, but without the possession implied in the fragment, Nick was free to appear in any of Hemingway‚Äôs future stories‚Äîbut only if he chose.

Design and development At the time of the formation of PZL the Department of Aeronautics gave the nascent design office the task of designing a heavy bomber. Drawing heavily on his 1924 WZ-IX Pteranodon bomber, Zalewski was given the task as designer. During the winter of 1928-29 the detailed design of the PZL.3 bomber took shape, emerging as a large aircraft powered by four Bristol Jupiter engines mounted in tandem in nacelles on pylons above the wings. Due to the dire economic situation at the start of the 1930s and the expected high costs, funds for construction of a prototype were not forthcoming so the project was dropped. The PZL.3 would have been a low-wing cantilever monoplane with four engines in push-pull tandem nacelles over the wings mounted on pylons. Built with a semi-monocoque stressed skin fuselage skinned with Duralumin skinning and structural parts,the PZL.3 would have had twin fins and a trousered fixed tail-wheel undercarriage. Armament would have included 3 machine-guns and up to of bombs. After the PZL.3 was rejected Zalewski left PZL and refused to work on Government sponsored projects thereafter.

The word is new, but the concept that \\"glamping\\" connotes, that of luxurious tent-living (or living in other camping accommodations), is not. In the 16th century, the Scottish Earl of Atholl prepared a lavish experience in the Highlands for the visiting King James V and his mother. Here, the Duke pitched lavish tents and filled them with all the provisions of his own home palace. Henry VIII at left arrives at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. The building at right was made of wood and painted canvas ‚Äì two wine fountains are pictured in front of it. Royal Collection, Hampton Court Palace. Probably the most extravagant example of palatial tent-living in history was the Field of the Cloth of Gold, a diplomatic summit in 1520 between Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France in northern France. Some 2,800 tents and marquees were erected, and fountains ran with red wine.Edward Hall's Chronicle At around the same time, the Ottomans had ostentatious, palatial tents transported from one military mission to the next. Entire teams of artisans travelled with the army to erect and maintain these imperial tents. As described by Professor Nurhan Atasoy, Some 400 years later, in the 1920s, an African safari became \\"the thing to do\\" among wealthy Americans and British. But wealthy travelers, even those in search of adventure, were not willing to sacrifice comfort or luxury. From electric generators, to folding baths, and cases of champagne, travelers were afforded every domestic luxury while on adventure.

The Alte Mozart-Ausgabe (published 1879‚Äì1882) gives the numbering sequence 1‚Äì41 for the 41 numbered symphonies. The unnumbered symphonies (some, including K. 76, published in supplements to the Alte-Mozart Ausgabe until 1910) are sometimes given numbers in the range 42 to 56, even though they were written earlier than Mozart's Symphony No. 41 (written in 1788). The symphony K. 76 is given the number 43 in this numbering scheme. Origins and authorship *Otto Jahn,quoted by Zaslaw (1988) in his Mozart biography,Hermann Abert: W. A. Mozart. Revised and expanded edition of Otto Jahn's Mozart. Part One 1756-1782. 7th Expanded edition, VEB Breitkopf & H√§rtel, Musikverlag, Leipzig 1955, p. 848 refers to the discovery of 20 symphonies attributed to Mozart in the archives of Breitkopf & H√§rtel. K√∂chel agreed with this view and considered K. 76 authentic Mozart. Jahn's write-up was based on the \\"Mozartiana Collection\\" of Johann Andr√©, in which ten of the aforementioned 20 symphonies are included (indicating that they were considered authentic), because they were sent directly from Constanze Mozart, Mozart's widow. Two of these works are symphonic versions of the overtures to Lucio Silla, K. 135 and Il sogno di Scipione, K. 126, increasing the likelihood that the other eight works are also authentic. Jahn dated K. 76 as \\"177?\\", while K√∂chel dated it as \\"perhaps 1769\\". *Wyzewa and Saint-Foix (1912)T√©odor de Wyzewa, Georges de Saint-Foix: Wolfgang Amed√©e Mozart, Sa vie musicale et son oeuvre. Vol. I/II, Paris 1936 (new edition); quoted by Zaslaw (1988) dated the symphony between December 1, 1766 and March 1, 1767. They compared the first movement of the symphony with the overture to Die Schuldigkeit des ersten Gebots, K. 35 and Mozart's earlier symphonies and concluded that K. 76 was written before the overture, perhaps in December 1766. They considered it to be \\"written with great care for his teacher and compatriots to prove what he had learned on the big trip (to London, Paris, Holland, etc.)\\" However, Zaslaw considered this interpretation \\"pure fantasy\\". *Abert doubted the similarities described by Wyzewa and Saint-Foix, because the development of the overture to K. 35 is based on the main theme of the overture, but the development of K. 76 digresses from the main theme of the symphony. The quotation of a theme by Jean-Philippe Rameau in the last movement points to the time of the first big trip, but the (later) addition of the minuet points to southern Germany as the place of composition. *EinsteinThird edition of the K√∂chel catalogue stated that the minuet is relatively of much greater maturity than the primitive other three movements and was probably composed later. Viennese symphonies would almost always have four movements and Mozart would often adjust three-movement symphonies he composed for other places by later adding a minuet and trio, so Einstein concluded that minuet and trio was composed for a trip to Vienna. The sixth edition of the K√∂chel catalogue lists the time as \\"allegedly in autumn 1767, in Vienna\\".Sixth edition of the K√∂chel catalogue *Gerhard Allroggen and Cliff Eisen suspect the true author of the symphony to be Leopold Mozart due to stylistic features.Wolfgang Gersthofer: Sinfonien KV 16-134.

Urea is a nitrogen-based compound produced in the kidneys. It is formed as a side compound during the process of producing protein. Overview Urea is not a protein but it contains nitrogen which is capable of being used by the microbial population in the rumen to produce protein. Molasses is the main by-product of sugarcane refining and is a suitable source of energy. Preparing an adequate source of energy and nitrogen under grazing conditions is necessary for grazing animals. Molasses blocks are palatable for the animals and the molasses has the ability to cover undesirable flavors that can be associated with some other chemicals added to the block. This gives the block the ability to contain high levels of unpalatable feedstuffs like urea. Urea is a cheap source of nitrogen, in comparison with other sources, and adding urea to the molasses blocks will reduce the cost of supplementation programs. Medicated blocks In tropical countries, inadequate nutrition and gastro-intestinal nematodes are amongst the commonest problems, particularly in sheep and goats. Molasses, urea and other components are used for producing molasses/urea feeds (blocks, pastes or licks). These preparations are a suitable way of supplying degradable protein and fermentable energy to ruminant animals, and they help increase the protein supply to them.

The convergence of labs-on- chips (LOCs) and cell biology has permitted the study of human physiology in an organ-specific context, introducing a novel model of in vitro multicellular human organisms. One day, they will perhaps abolish the need for animals in drug development and toxin testing. Although multiple publications claim to have translated organ functions onto this interface, the movement towards this microfluidic application is still in its infancy. Organs-on-chips will vary in design and approach between different researchers. As such, validation and optimization of these systems will likely be a long process. Organs that have been simulated by microfluidic devices include the heart, the lung, kidney, artery, bone, cartilage, skin and more. Nevertheless, building valid artificial organs requires not only a precise cellular manipulation, but a detailed understanding of the human body's fundamental intricate response to any event. A common concern with organs-on-chips lies in the isolation of organs during testing. The body is a complex network of physiological processes, making it challenging to simulate a single organ. Microfabrication, microelectronics and microfluidics offer the prospect of modeling sophisticated in vitro physiological responses under accurately simulated conditions. Lab-on-chip A lab-on-a-chip is a device that integrates one or several laboratory functions on a single chip that deals with handling particles in hollow microfluidic channels. It has been developed for over a decade. Advantages in handling particles at such a small scale include lowering fluid volume consumption (lower reagents costs, less waste), increasing portability of the devices, increasing process control (due to quicker thermo-chemical reactions) and decreasing fabrication costs. Additionally, microfluidic flow is entirely laminar (i.e., no turbulence). Consequently, there is virtually no mixing between neighboring streams in one hollow channel. In cellular biology convergence, this rare property in fluids has been leveraged to better study complex cell behaviors, such as cell motility in response to chemotactic stimuli, stem cell differentiation, axon guidance, subcellular propagation of biochemical signaling and embryonic development. Transitioning from 3D cell-culture models to OOCs 3D cell- culture models exceed 2D culture systems by promoting higher levels of cell differentiation and tissue organization. 3D culture systems are more successful because the flexibility of the ECM gels accommodates shape changes and cell-cell connections ‚Äì formerly prohibited by rigid 2D culture substrates. Nevertheless, even the best 3D culture models fail to mimic an organ's cellular properties in many aspects, including tissue-to-tissue interfaces (e.g., epithelium and vascular endothelium), spatiotemporal gradients of chemicals, and the mechanically active microenvironments (e.g. arteries‚Äô vasoconstriction and vasodilator responses to temperature differentials). The application of microfluidics in organs-on-chips enables the efficient transport and distribution of nutrients and other soluble cues throughout the viable 3D tissue constructs. Organs-on-chips are referred to as the next wave of 3D cell-culture models that mimic whole living organs‚Äô biological activities, dynamic mechanical properties and biochemical functionalities. Organs  Brain-on-a-chip  Brain-on-a-chip devices create an interface between neuroscience and microfluidics by: 1) improving culture viability; 2) supporting high-throughput screening; 3) modeling organ- level physiology and disease in vitro/ex vivo, and 4) adding high precision and tunability of microfluidic devices. Brain-on-a-chip devices span multiple levels of complexity in terms of cell culture methodology. Devices have been made using platforms that range from traditional 2D cell culture to 3D tissues in the form of organotypic brain slices. = Overview of Organotypic Brain Slices = Organotypic brain slices are an in vitro model that replicates in vivo physiology with additional throughput and optical benefits, thus pairing well with microfluidic devices. Brain slices have advantages over primary cell culture in that tissue architecture is preserved and multicellular interactions can still occur. There is flexibility in their use, as slices can be used acutely (less than 6 hours after slice harvesting) or cultured for later experimental use. Because organotypic brain slices can maintain viability for weeks, they allow for long-term effects to be studied. Slice- based systems also provide experimental access with precise control of extracellular environments, making it a suitable platform for correlating disease with neuropathological outcomes. Because approximately 10 to 20 slices can be extracted from a single brain, animal usage is significantly reduced relative to in vivo studies. Organotypic brain slices can be extracted and cultured from multiple animal species (e.g. rats), but also from humans. = Applications = Microfluidic devices have been paired with organotypic slices to improve culture viability. The standard procedure for culturing organotypic brain slices (around 300 microns in thickness) uses semi-porous membranes to create an air-medium interface, but this technique results in diffusion limitations of nutrients and dissolved gases. Because microfluidic systems introduce laminar flow of these necessary nutrients and gases, transport is improved and higher tissue viability can be achieved. In addition to keeping standard slices viable, brain-on-a-chip platforms have allowed the successful culturing of thicker brain slices (approximately 700 microns), despite a significant transport barrier due to thickness. As thicker slices retain more native tissue architecture, this allows brain-on-a-chip devices to achieve more ‚Äúin vivo-like‚Äù characteristics without sacrificing cell viability. Microfluidic devices support high-throughput screening and toxicological assessments in both 2D and slice cultures, leading to the development of novel therapeutics targeted for the brain. One device was able to screen the drugs Pitavastatin and Irinotecan combinatorically in glioblastoma multiform (the most common form of human brain cancer). These screening approaches have been combined with the modeling of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a significant hurdle for drugs to overcome when treating the brain, allowing for drug efficacy across this barrier to be studied in vitro. Microfluidic probes have been used to deliver dyes with high regional precision, making way for localized microperfusion in drug applications. Because microfluidic devices can be designed with optical accessibility, this also allows for the visualization of morphology and processes in specific regions or individual cells. Brain-on-a-chip systems can model organ-level physiology in neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis more accurately than with traditional 2D and 3D cell culture techniques. The ability to model these diseases in a way that is indicative of in vivo conditions is essential for the translation of therapies and treatments. Additionally, brain-on-a-chip devices have been used for medical diagnostics, such as in biomarker detection for cancer in brain tissue slices. = Limitations = Brain-on-a-chip devices can cause shear stress on cells or tissue due to flow through small channels, which can result in cellular damage. These small channels also introduce susceptibility to the trapping of air bubbles that can disrupt flow and potentially cause damage to the cells. The widespread use of PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) in brain-on-a- chip devices has some drawbacks. Although PDMS is cheap, malleable, and transparent, proteins and small molecules can be absorbed by it and later leech at uncontrolled rates. Lung-on-a-chip Lung-on-a-chips are being designed in an effort to improve the physiological relevance of existing in vitro alveolar-capillary interface models. Such a multifunctional microdevice can reproduce key structural, functional and mechanical properties of the human alveolar-capillary interface (i.e., the fundamental functional unit of the living lung). Dongeun Huh from Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard describes their fabrication of a system containing two closely apposed microchannels separated by a thin (10 ¬µm) porous flexible membrane made of PDMS. The device largely comprises three microfluidic channels, and only the middle one holds the porous membrane. Culture cells were grown on either side of the membrane: human alveolar epithelial cells on one side, and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells on the other. The compartmentalization of the channels facilitates not only the flow of air as a fluid which delivers cells and nutrients to the apical surface of the epithelium, but also allows for pressure differences to exist between the middle and side channels. During normal inspiration in a human's respiratory cycle, intrapleural pressure decreases, triggering an expansion of the alveoli. As air is pulled into the lungs, alveolar epithelium and the coupled endothelium in the capillaries are stretched. Since a vacuum is connected to the side channels, a decrease in pressure will cause the middle channel to expand, thus stretching the porous membrane and subsequently, the entire alveolar-capillary interface. The pressure-driven dynamic motion behind the stretching of the membrane, also described as a cyclic mechanical strain (valued at approximately 10%), significantly increases the rate of nanoparticle translocation across the porous membrane, when compared to a static version of this device, and to a Transwell culture system. :In order to fully validate the biological accuracy of a device, its whole-organ responses must be evaluated. In this instance, researchers inflicted injuries to the cells: ::* Pulmonary inflammation :::Pulmonary inflammatory responses entail a multistep strategy, but alongside an increased production of epithelial cells and an early response release of cytokines, the interface should undergo an increased number of leukocyte adhesion molecules. In Huh‚Äôs experiment, the pulmonary inflammation was simulated by introducing medium containing a potent proinflammatory mediator. Only hours after the injury was caused, the cells in the microfluidic device subjected to a cyclic strain reacted in accordance with the previously mentioned biological response. ::*Pulmonary infection :::Living E-coli bacteria was used to demonstrate how the system can even mimic the innate cellular response to a bacterial pulmonary infection. The bacteria were introduced onto the apical surface of the alveolar epithelium. Within hours, neutrophils were detected in the alveolar compartment, meaning they had transmigrated from the vascular microchannel where the porous membrane had phagocytized the bacteria. Additionally, researchers believe the potential value of this lung-on-a-chip system will aid in toxicology applications. By investigating the pulmonary response to nanoparticles, researchers hope to learn more about health risks in certain environments, and correct previously oversimplified in vitro models. Because a microfluidic lung-on-a-chip can more exactly reproduce the mechanical properties of a living human lung, its physiological responses will be quicker and more accurate than a Transwell culture system. Nevertheless, published studies admit that responses of a lung-on-a-chip don't yet fully reproduce the responses of native alveolar epithelial cells. Heart-on-a-chip Past efforts to replicate in vivo cardiac tissue environments have proven to be challenging due to difficulties when mimicking contractility and electrophysiological responses. Such features would greatly increase the accuracy of in vitro experiments. Microfluidics has already contributed to in vitro experiments on cardiomyocytes, which generate the electrical impulses that control the heart rate. For instance, researchers have built an array of PDMS microchambers, aligned with sensors and stimulating electrodes as a tool that will electrochemically and optically monitor the cardiomyocytes‚Äô metabolism. Another lab-on-a-chip similarly combined a microfluidic network in PDMS with planar microelectrodes, this time to measure extracellular potentials from single adult murine cardiomyocytes. A reported design of a heart-on-a-chip claims to have built \\"an efficient means of measuring structure-function relationships in constructs that replicate the hierarchical tissue architectures of laminar cardiac muscle.\\" This chip determines that the alignment of the myocytes in the contractile apparatus made of cardiac tissue and the gene expression profile (affected by shape and cell structure deformation) contributes to the force produced in cardiac contractility. This heart-on-a-chip is a biohybrid construct: an engineered anisotropic ventricular myocardium is an elastomeric thin film. The design and fabrication process of this particular microfluidic device entails first covering the edges of a glass surface with tape (or any protective film) such as to contour the substrate's desired shape. A spin coat layer of PNIPA is then applied. After its dissolution, the protective film is peeled away, resulting in a self-standing body of PNIPA. The final steps involve the spin coating of protective surface of PDMS over the cover slip and curing. Muscular thin films (MTF) enable cardiac muscle monolayers to be engineered on a thin flexible substrate of PDMS. In order to properly seed the 2D cell culture, a microcontact printing technique was used to lay out a fibronectin \\"brick wall\\" pattern on the PDMS surface. Once the ventricular myocytes were seeded on the functionalized substrate, the fibronectin pattern oriented them to generate an anisotropic monolayer. After the cutting of the thin films into two rows with rectangular teeth, and subsequent placement of the whole device in a bath, electrodes stimulate the contraction of the myocytes via a field-stimulation ‚Äì thus curving the strips/teeth in the MTF. Researchers have developed a correlation between tissue stress and the radius of curvature of the MTF strips during the contractile cycle, validating the demonstrated chip as a \\"platform for quantification of stress, electrophysiology and cellular architecture.\\" Kidney-on-a-chip Renal cells and nephrons have already been simulated by microfluidic devices. \\"Such cell cultures can lead to new insights into cell and organ function and be used for drug screening\\". A kidney-on-a-chip device has the potential to accelerate research encompassing artificial replacement for lost kidney function. Nowadays, dialysis requires patients to go to a clinic up to three times per week. A more transportable and accessible form of treatment would not only increase the patient's overall health (by increasing frequency of treatment), but the whole process would become more efficient and tolerable. Artificial kidney research is striving to bring transportability, wearability and perhaps implantation capability to the devices through innovative disciplines: microfluidics, miniaturization and nanotechnology. = Nephron-on-a-chip = The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney and is composed of a glomerulus and a tubular component. Researchers at MIT claim to have designed a bioartificial device that replicates the function of the nephron's glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule and loop of Henle. Each part of the device has its unique design, generally consisting of two microfabricated layers separated by a membrane. The only inlet to the microfluidic device is designed for the entering blood sample. In the glomerulus‚Äô section of the nephron, the membrane allows certain blood particles through its wall of capillary cells, composed by the endothelium, basement membrane and the epithelial podocytes. The fluid that is filtered from the capillary blood into Bowman's space is called filtrate or primary urine. In the tubules, some substances are added to the filtrate as part of the urine formation, and some substances reabsorbed out of the filtrate and back into the blood. The first segment of these tubules is the proximal convoluted tubule. This is where the almost complete absorption of nutritionally important substances takes place. In the device, this section is merely a straight channel, but blood particles going to the filtrate have to cross the previously mentioned membrane and a layer of renal proximal tubule cells. The second segment of the tubules is the loop of Henle where the reabsorption of water and ions from the urine takes place. The device's looping channels strives to simulate the countercurrent mechanism of the loop of Henle. Likewise, the loop of Henle requires a number of different cell types because each cell type has distinct transport properties and characteristics. These include the descending limb cells, thin ascending limb cells, thick ascending limb cells, cortical collecting duct cells and medullary collecting duct cells. One step towards validating the microfluidic device's simulation of the full filtration and reabsorption behavior of a physiological nephron would include demonstrating that the transport properties between blood and filtrate are identical with regards to where they occur and what is being let in by the membrane. For example, the large majority of passive transport of water occurs in the proximal tubule and the descending thin limb, or the active transport of NaCl largely occurs in the proximal tubule and the thick ascending limb. The device's design requirements would require the filtration fraction in the glomerulus to vary between 15‚Äì20%, or the filtration reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule to vary between 65‚Äì70%, and finally the urea concentration in urine (collected at one of the two outlets of the device) to vary between 200‚Äì400 mM. One recent report illustrates a biomimic nephron on hydrogel microfluidic devices with establishing the function of passive diffusion. The complex physiological function of nephron is achieved on the basis of interactions between vessels and tubules (both are hollow channels). However, conventional laboratory techniques usually focus on 2D structures, such as petri-dish that lacks capability to recapitulate real physiology that occurs in 3D. Therefore, the authors developed a new method to fabricate functional, cell-lining and perfusable microchannels inside 3D hydrogel. The vessel endothelial and renal epithelial cells are cultured inside hydrogel microchannel and form cellular coverage to mimic vessels and tubules, respectively. They employed confocal microscope to examine the passive diffusion of one small organic molecule (usually drugs) between the vessels and tubules in hydrogel. The study demonstrates the beneficial potential to mimic renal physiology for regenerative medicine and drug screening. Vessel-on-a-chip Cardiovascular diseases are often caused by changes in structure and function of small blood vessels. For instance, self-reported rates of hypertension suggest that the rate is increasing, says a 2003 report from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A microfluidic platform simulating the biological response of an artery could not only enable organ-based screens to occur more frequently throughout a drug development trial, but also yield a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind pathologic changes in small arteries and develop better treatment strategies. Axel Gunther from the University of Toronto argues that such MEMS-based devices could potentially help in the assessment of a patient's microvascular status in a clinical setting (personalized medicine). Conventional methods used to examine intrinsic properties of isolated resistance vessels (arterioles and small arteries with diameters varying between 30 ¬µm and 300 ¬µm) include the pressure myography technique. However, such methods currently require manually skilled personnel and are not scalable. An artery-on-a-chip could overcome several of these limitations by accommodating an artery onto a platform which would be scalable, inexpensive and possibly automated in its manufacturing. An organ-based microfluidic platform has been developed as a lab-on-a-chip onto which a fragile blood vessel can be fixed, allowing for determinants of resistance artery malfunctions to be studied. The artery microenvironment is characterized by surrounding temperature, transmural pressure, and luminal & abluminal drug concentrations. The multiple inputs from a microenvironment cause a wide range of mechanical or chemical stimuli on the smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) that line the vessel's outer and luminal walls, respectively. Endothelial cells are responsible for releasing vasoconstriction and vasodilator factors, thus modifying tone. Vascular tone is defined as the degree of constriction inside a blood vessel relative to its maximum diameter. Pathogenic concepts currently believe that subtle changes to this microenvironment have pronounced effects on arterial tone and can severely alter peripheral vascular resistance. The engineers behind this design believe that a specific strength lies in its ability to control and simulate heterogeneous spatiotemporal influences found within the microenvironment, whereas myography protocols have, by virtue of their design, only established homogeneous microenvironments. They proved that by delivering phenylephrine through only one of the two channels providing superfusion to the outer walls, the drug-facing side constricted much more than the drug opposing side. The artery-on-a-chip is designed for reversible implantation of the sample. The device contains a microchannel network, an artery loading area and a separate artery inspection area. There is a microchannel used for loading the artery segment, and when the loading well is sealed, it is also used as a perfusion channel, to replicate the process of nutritive delivery of arterial blood to a capillary bed in the biological tissue. Another pair of microchannels serves to fix the two ends of the arterial segment. Finally, the last pair of microchannels is used to provide superfusion flow rates, in order to maintain the physiological and metabolic activity of the organ by delivering a constant sustaining medium over the abluminal wall. A thermoelectric heater and a thermoresistor are connected to the chip and maintain physiological temperatures at the artery inspection area. The protocol of loading and securing the tissue sample into the inspection zone helps understand how this approach acknowledges whole organ functions. After immersing the tissue segment into the loading well, the loading process is driven by a syringe withdrawing a constant flow rate of buffer solution at the far end of the loading channel. This causes the transport of the artery towards its dedicated position. This is done with closed fixation and superfusion in/outlet lines. After stopping the pump, sub-atmospheric pressure is applied through one of the fixation channels. Then after sealing the loading well shut, the second fixation channel is subjected to a sub- atmospheric pressure. Now the artery is symmetrically established in the inspection area, and a transmural pressure is felt by the segment. The remaining channels are opened and constant perfusion and superfusion are adjusted using separate syringe pumps. Vessel-on-chips have been applied to study many disease processes. For example, Alireza Mashaghi and his co-workers developed a model to study viral hemorrhagic syndrome, which involves virus induced vascular integrity loss. The model was used to study Ebola virus disease and to study anti-Ebola drugs. Ebola hemorrhagic shock syndrome-on-a- chip Skin-on-a-chip Human skin is the first line of defense against many pathogens and can itself be subject to a variety of diseases and issues, such as cancers and inflammation. As such, skin-on-a-chip (SoC) applications include testing of topical pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, studying the pathology of skin diseases and inflammation, and ‚Äúcreating noninvasive automated cellular assays‚Äù to test for the presence of antigens or antibodies that could denote the presence of a pathogen. Despite the wide variety of potential applications, relatively little research has gone into developing a skin-on-a-chip compared to many other organ-on-a-chips, such as lungs and kidneys. Issues such as detachment of the collagen scaffolding from microchannels, incomplete cellular differentiation, and predominant use of poly(dimethysiloxane) (PDMS) for device fabrication, which has been shown to leach chemicals into biological samples and cannot be mass-produced stymie standardization of a platform. One additional difficulty is the variability of cell-culture scaffolding, or the base substance in which to culture cells, that is used in skin-on-chip devices. In the human body, this substance is known as the extracellular matrix. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is composed primarily of collagen, and various collagen-based scaffolding has been tested in SoC models. Collagen tends to detach from the microfluidic backbone during culturing due to the contraction of fibroblasts. One study attempted to address this problem by comparing the qualities of collagen scaffolding from three different animal sources: pig skin, rat tail, and duck feet. Other studies also faced detachment issues due to contraction, which can problematic considering that the process of full skin differentiation can take up to several weeks. Contraction issues have been avoided by replacing collagen scaffolding with a fibrin-based dermal matrix, which did not contract. Greater differentiation and formation of cell layers was also reported in microfluidic culture when compared to traditional static culture, agreeing with earlier findings of improved cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions due to dynamic perfusion, or increased permeation through interstitial spaces due to the pressure from continuous media flow. This improved differentiation and growth is thought to be in part a product of shear stress created by the pressure gradient along a microchannel due to fluid flow, which may also improve nutrient supply to cells not directly adjacent to the medium. In static cultures, used in traditional skin equivalents, cells receive nutrients in the medium only through diffusion, whereas dynamic perfusion can improve nutrient flow through interstitial spaces, or gaps between cells. This perfusion has also been demonstrated to improve tight junction formation of the stratum corneum, the tough outer layer of the epidermis, which is the main barrier to penetration of the surface layer of the skin. Dynamic perfusion may also improve cell viability, demonstrated by placing a commercial skin equivalent in a microfluidic platform that extended the expected lifespan by several weeks. This early study also demonstrated the importance of hair follicles in skin equivalent models. Hair follicles are the primary route into the subcutaneous layer for topical creams and other substances applied to the surface of the skin, a feature that more recent studies have often not accounted for. One study developed a SoC consisting of three layers, the epidermis, dermis, and endothelial layer, separated by porous membranes, to study edema, swelling due to extracellular fluid accumulation, a common response to infection or injury and an essential step for cellular repair. It was demonstrated that pre-application of Dex, a steroidal cream with anti- inflammatory properties, reduced this swelling in the SoC. Human-on-a-chip Researchers are working towards building a multi-channel 3D microfluidic cell culture system that compartmentalizes microenvironments in which 3D cellular aggregates are cultured to mimic multiple organs in the body. Most organ-on-a- chip models today only culture one cell type, so even though they may be valid models for studying whole organ functions, the systemic effect of a drug on the human body is not verified. In particular, an integrated cell culture analog (¬µCCA) was developed and included lung cells, drug-metabolizing liver and fat cells. The cells were linked in a 2D fluidic network with culture medium circulating as a blood surrogate, thus efficiently providing a nutritional delivery transport system, while simultaneously removing wastes from the cells. \\"The development of the ¬µCCA laid the foundation for a realistic in vitro pharmacokinetic model and provided an integrated biomimetic system for culturing multiple cell types with high fidelity to in vivo situations\\", claim C. Zhang et al. They have developed a microfluidic human- on-a-chip, culturing four different cell types to mimic four human organs: liver, lung, kidney and fat. They focused on developing a standard serum-free culture media that would be valuable to all cell types included in the device. Optimized standard media are generally targeted to one specific cell-type, whereas a human-on-a-chip will evidently require a common medium (CM). In fact, they claim to have identified a cell culture CM that, when used to perfuse all cell cultures in the microfluidic device, maintains the cells‚Äô functional levels. Heightening the sensitivity of the in vitro cultured cells ensures the validity of the device, or that any drug injected into the microchannels will stimulate an identical physiological and metabolic reaction from the sample cells as whole organs in humans. With more extensive development of this kind of chip, pharmaceutical companies will potentially be able to measure direct effects of one organ's reaction on another. For instance, the delivery of biochemical substances would be screened to confirm that even though it may benefit one cell type, it does not compromise the functions of others. It is probably already possible to print these organs with 3D printers, but the cost is too high. Designing whole body biomimetic devices addresses a major reservation that pharmaceutical companies have towards organs-on-chips, namely the isolation of organs. As these devices become more and more accessible, the complexity of the design increases exponentially. Systems will soon have to simultaneously provide mechanical perturbation and fluid flow through a circulatory system. \\"Anything that requires dynamic control rather than just static control is a challenge\\", says Takayama from the University of Michigan. Replacing animal testing In the early phase of drug development, animal models were the only way of obtaining in vivo data that would predict the human pharmacokinetic responses. However, experiments on animals are lengthy, expensive and controversial. For example, animal models are often subjected to mechanical or chemical techniques that simulate human injuries. There are also concerns with regards to the validity of such animal models, due to deficiency in cross-species extrapolation. Moreover, animal models offer very limited control of individual variables and it can be cumbersome to harvest specific information. Therefore, mimicking a human's physiological responses in an in vitro model needs to be made more affordable, and needs to offer cellular level control in biological experiments: biomimetic microfluidic systems could replace animal testing. The development of MEMS-based biochips that reproduce complex organ-level pathological responses could revolutionize many fields, including toxicology and the developmental process of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics that rely on animal testing and clinical trials. Recently, physiologically based perfusion in vitro systems have been developed to provide cell culture environment close to in vivo cell environment. A new testing platforms based on multi- compartmental perfused systems have gained a remarkable interest in pharmacology and toxicology. It aims to provide a cell culture environment close to the in vivo situation to reproduce more reliably in vivo mechanisms or ADME processes that involve its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination. Perfused in vitro systems combined with kinetic modelling are promising tools for studying in vitro the different processes involved in the toxicokinetics of xenobiotics. Efforts made toward the development of micro fabricated cell culture systems that aim to create models that replicate aspects of the human body as closely as possible and give examples that demonstrate their potential use in drug development, such as identifying synergistic drug interactions as well as simulating multi-organ metabolic interactions. Multi compartment micro fluidic-based devices, particularly those that are physical representations of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models that represent the mass transfer of compounds in compartmental models of the mammalian body, may contribute to improving the drug development process. Mathematical pharmacokinetic (PK) models aim to estimate concentration-time profiles within each organ on the basis of the initial drug dose. Such mathematical models can be relatively simple, treating the body as a single compartment in which the drug distribution reaches a rapid equilibrium after administration. Mathematical models can be highly accurate when all parameters involved are known. Models that combine PK or PBPK models with PD models can predict the time-dependent pharmacological effects of a drug. We can nowadays predict with PBPK models the PK of about any chemical in humans, almost from first principles. These models can be either very simple, like statistical dose-response models, or sophisticated and based on systems biology, according to the goal pursued and the data available. All we need for those models are good parameter values for the molecule of interest. Microfluidic cell culture systems such as micro cell culture analogs (ŒºCCAs) could be used in conjunction with PBPK models. These ŒºCCAs scaled-down devices, termed also body-on-a-chip devices, can simulate multi-tissue interactions under near-physiological fluid flow conditions and with realistic tissue-to-tissue size ratios . Data obtained with these systems may be used to test and refine mechanistic hypotheses. Microfabricating devices also allows us to custom-design them and scale the organs' compartments correctly with respect to one another. Because the device can be used with both animal and human cells, it can facilitate cross-species extrapolation. Used in conjunction with PBPK models, the devices permit an estimation of effective concentrations that can be used for studies with animal models or predict the human response. In the development of multicompartment devices, representations of the human body such as those in used PBPK models can be used to guide the device design with regard to the arrangement of chambers and fluidic channel connections to augment the drug development process, resulting in increased success in clinical trials.

C. 1997. An ecological study of Frasera caroliniensis. Castanea, journal of the Southern Appalachian Botanical Society. 62(3): 185‚Äì193. It was previously known as Swertia caroliniensis.  Description  American columbo is a monocarpic perennial, meaning it flowers once after multiple seasons, and then dies. When it reaches the flowering stage, the 3 ‚Äì 6 inch lanceolate leaves develop (usually in whorls of four) on a round elongated stem, and approximately 50 to 100 flowers will develop a panicle, with the fruits maturing soon after. The flowers that it produces are about 1 inch in diameter and folious (tall and \\"spike\\"-like), green to yellow in colour with purple speckles. It is a perfect and complete flower, with four stamens and two carpels.Card, H.H. 1931. A revision of Genus Frasera. Annals of Missouri Botanical Garden. 18(2): 245‚Äì282. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2394089 The oblong shaped seed capsule has a brownish color and is about 1/2 inch long. The entire plant can reach heights over . Though it is monocarpic, the plant may live for up to 30 years before flowering. The roots of F. caroliniensis are a taproot system, with a thick and fleshy taproot, and in some Frasera species, this may be modified into a branched rhizome. The leaves of F. caroliensis are carried on stalks (\\"petiolate\\") and have a thick, waxy texture.  Other names  aka American calumba, American colombo, Radix colombo americanae, Frasera Walteri, Frasera Canadensis, Faux colomo, meadowpride, pyramid-flower, pyramid-plant, Indian lettuce, yellow gentian, ground-century;  Distribution and habitat  American columbo lives in dry upland areas, rocky woods and areas with calcareous soil, though it is not limited by soil texture or other soil characteristics. The species ranges from deciduous forest regions in southern Ontario, through southern Michigan, northern Indiana, southern Illinois, southern Missouri, southeast Oklahoma, southwestern Arkansas, and northern Louisiana.Threadgill, F. P., Baskin, M. T., Baskin, C. C. 1979. Geographical Ecology of Frasera caroliniensis. Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club. 106(3): 185‚Äì188.  Human importance  Medicinal uses for American columbo have mostly been rebutted. However, it was a common belief in the early 19th century that the root of the plant might be externally used for gangrene. It was also claimed to be useful in treating jaundice, scurvy, gout and rabies. The dried root, which was official in the United States Pharmacopoeia from 1820 to 1880, is used as a simple tonic. Frasera caroliniensis is chiefly known as an occasional substitute for Calumba root, or Jatheorrhiza Columba, a native of Mozambique.  Ecology  Several tree species are associated with F. caroliniensis, such as sweet-gum (Liquidambar styraciflua), tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) and pignut hickory (Carya glabra). Even more vines and understory trees are associated with this species, such as eastern redbud (Cercis canadensis), strawberry bush (Euonymus americanus), Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia) and poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). Herbs associated with the species include the prostrate ticktrefoil (Desmodium rotundifolium), Christmas fern (Polystichum acrostichoides) and ebony spleenwort (Asplenium platyneuron). The canopy of trees that are associated with this species are important for its survival, though if the canopy becomes too dense the plant may not flower as well. When the plants do flower, they contain large nectaries, which aid in pollination.Threadgill, F. P., Baskin, M. T., Baskin, C. C. 1981. The ecological life cycle of Frasera caroliniensis, a long-lived monocarpic perennial. American Midland Naturalist. 105(2): 277‚Äì289.  Conservation  This species is endangered in Ontario and nationally in Canada. The most extreme limiting factor for this species is invasive plants that are heavily infesting its habitat. This may be attributed to its long life cycle, which would not allow the species to adapt to rapid changes in environment, and therefore not survive long enough to disperse its seeds. Also this species has a \\"seed dormancy\\" (prevention of germination until optimal environmental conditions are present), that can only be broken in typical spring conditions. Furthermore, deforestation can be extremely destructive to the plants, as they rely on the canopy provided from the trees. Conservation practices to manage these issues include leaving surrounding trees within , stimulating growth by cutting a small opening in the canopy, and draining overly flooded areas to provide clay-like soil.

Set in present-day England, it features a boy who struggles to cope with the consequences of his mother's illness. He is repeatedly visited in the middle of the night by a monster who tells stories. Dowd was terminally ill with cancer herself when she started the story and died before she could write it. Ness and Kay won the Carnegie Medal and the Greenaway Medal in 2012, the \\"year's best\\" children's literary awards by the British librarians (CILIP). A Monster Calls is the only book to have won both Medals. The novel was adapted into the 2016 of the same name. Origin Siobhan Dowd conceived the novel while she had cancer. She discussed it and contracted to write it with editor Denise Johnstone-Burt at Walker Books, who also worked with Patrick Ness. After Dowd's death in August 2007, Walker arranged for Ness to write the story. Later, Walker and Ness arranged for Jim Kay to illustrate it, but Ness and Kay did not meet until after it was published in May 2011. After winning the Carnegie, Ness discussed the writing with The Guardian newspaper: : I wouldn't have taken it on if I didn't have complete freedom to go wherever I needed to go with it. If I'd felt hampered at all ‚Äì again, even for very good reasons ‚Äì then that harms the story, I think. And I did this not for egomaniacal reasons, that my decisions were somehow automatically right or some such nonsense, but because I know that this is what Siobhan would have done. She would have set it free, let it grow and change, and so I wasn't trying to guess what she might have written, I was merely following the same process she would have followed, which is a different thing. : ... : I always say it felt like a really private conversation between me and her, and that mostly it was me saying, \\"Just look what we're getting away with.\\" Kay was selected based on illustrating one scene, solicited by art director Ben Norland: : Due to other commitments I had a weekend to produce an image, and I very hastily created the scene of the Monster leaning against the house. It was a technique I hadn't tried before, dictated to some degree by the time constraints, which in hindsight may have helped. : ... : I imagine the story as a moving film or piece of theatre, and I start building the props and setting the scenery around the characters. I love the atmosphere, and I guess that's what I wanted to contribute. If I'd been left alone I would have avoided all of the key scenes, I was nervous about dealing with them, but Ben was fantastic in giving the book structure and, thankfully, insisting that I should tackle the explosive, energetic elements of the book. Plot Thirteen-year-old Conor O'Malley awakens from the same nightmare he has been experiencing for the past few months, \\"the one with the darkness and the wind and the screaming\\". At seven minutes after midnight (\\"12:07\\"), a voice calls to him from outside his bedroom window, which overlooks an old church and its graveyard sheltered by a yew tree. Walking to the window, Conor meets the monster who called, a towering mass of branches and leaves formed in a human shape from the yew tree. The monster is intrigued that Conor is not afraid of it and insists that Conor summoned it. The monster claims to be a version of the green man and warns that it will tell Conor three true stories, after which Conor must tell a story of his own, and if it is not true, the monster will eat him. The monster continues to meet Conor to tell its stories, almost always at 12:07 am or pm, which all involve other occasions the monster was summoned. Between its tales, which aim to demonstrate the complications inherent in humans, it is revealed that Conor's mother is undergoing chemotherapy and has been afflicted with terminal cancer for the past year. Conor is isolated and alone. His flaky father uses his new family in the US as an excuse to be detached and unsupportive. His distant relationship with his pushy and cold grandmother provides no comfort either. Conor is a victim of bullying at school and he has distanced himself from all social contact other than that of the monster. As the story progresses, his mother's condition worsens and Conor's encounters with the monster have escalating consequences. The story also mentions an alleged \\"Pit Monster\\" and \\"Sky Monster\\". At the end of the book the reader finds out why the monster has been coming and about the nightmare Conor fears: Conor holds onto his mother's arms, gripping her tightly as she's about to fall off a cliff. Conor loosens his grip, lets his mother fall purposely, though he could have held on to her longer. The monster came for Conor to confess the truth to his mother about how he wanted her to die so she didn't have to suffer, he wouldn't feel so isolated, and to end the pain for both of them. By doing so, Conor could finally let his mother go. At 12:07, the time the monster usually arrived, Conor's mother passed, and so did all their pain. Conor's tale was told. The Four Stories ; The first story An old king who has lost his entire family, except a young grandson, remarries a beautiful young woman many claim to be a witch. He dies before the young prince has come of age, leaving the step-grandmother as regent. She rules well and fairly, but‚Äînot wanting to hand over the kingdom‚Äîplots to marry the prince and remain queen. The prince, who has a lover, runs away with his chosen bride, planning to flee to the neighboring kingdom. There they will marry and wait out the time until he's of age to claim the throne. They stop and sleep under the yew tree (the monster), but in the morning, the young woman is dead, having been murdered, and the shocked young prince is covered in blood. He reasons to the villagers that the queen must have killed his bride out of jealousy in order to keep her throne. Enraged, the commoners rally around the prince to storm the castle, and the monster follows. They capture the queen and condemn her to burn at the stake. The monster arrives to snatch her from the fire and carry her away to a far- off land where she lives out the rest of her life. While disagreeable and a witch, she was not the one who had killed the girl. The prince had murdered her under the yew tree in order to inspire his people to back him into overthrowing the queen. This story also discusses the need for humans to lie to themselves, such as the prince who wholeheartedly believes that the queen is responsible for his fianc√©'s death despite her being murdered by his hand, and their willingness to believe those lies for their own comfort and happiness. ; The second story A greedy, ill-tempered apothecary who follows the old traditions and beliefs constantly pesters a parson to allow him to cut down the yew tree in the churchyard and use it for medicinal ingredients. The apothecary becomes less and less popular and is nearly ruined, aided by the apothecary's own foul nature and the parson's active condemnation of him from the pulpit. When a sickness sweeps the land and many die, the parson goes to the apothecary and asks him to save the lives of his two ill daughters after all other resources are exhausted. When the apothecary asks why he should help a man who has turned people away from his skills and denied him the yew tree, his best source of healing ingredients, the parson begs. The parson promises to give him the yew tree and deliver the parishioners to him as patients. In response to the parson's promise to revoke his beliefs and give up everything if only his daughters are healed, the apothecary says that he cannot help the parson and the girls die. The monster awakens from the yew tree to destroy the parson's house and raze it to the ground as punishment. While the apothecary was a nasty, greedy man, he was a healer and would have saved many, including the girls, if the parson had given him the yew tree when first asked. The parson, however, was a man who lived off of belief, but had none of his own and changed beliefs as it suited him and convenience. His disbelief of the apothecary's skill caused many to die, even his children. The healing traditions followed by the apothecary require belief in order to work; without the parson's, the apothecary was unable to treat the two girls. At the end of the story, Conor participates as the monster destroys the parson's house, to waken and discover that he has vandalized his grandmother's sitting room, shattering many valuable and beloved items beyond repair. ;The third story There was a man who was invisible because no one ever saw him. Tired of this, he summoned the monster to ensure no one forgot to see him again. The monster made them see, but there are harder things than being invisible. As this story is told, Conor is briefly possessed by the monster and physically and violently assaults Harry, the school bully, throwing him across the dining hall, putting the boy in the hospital. ;The fourth story Conor must confront his nightmare to tell the fourth story or face being engulfed by smoke and flames. The church around the yew tree is destroyed and the land underneath Conor's mother's feet collapses, and she almost falls into the dark abyss. Conor holds onto his mother desperately but she eventually falls into the hole. The monster tells Conor to speak the truth but Conor refuses. The monster yells at Conor, calling for the truth until Conor finally yells that he wishes it was all over. Although Conor loved his mother, he knew from the very beginning that she was going to die. He couldn't bear to not know when she would be gone and part of him, a selfish, very human part, simply wanted all the suffering to end. After Conor faces his truth his grandmother finds him and takes him to his dying mother's bedside at the hospital. The fourth story ends with a young boy clinging tightly to his mother. Critical reception  A Monster Calls received widespread acclaim. Philip Pullman, author of the fantasy trilogy His Dark Materials, praised the novel as \\"compelling ... powerful and impressive\\", Similarly, New York Times critic Jessica Bruder wrote \\"this is one profoundly sad story\\" and called the novel \\"a potent piece of art,\\" applauding Kay's illustrations. Daniel Hahn from The Independent also praised A Monster Calls, saying that it was \\"brave and beautiful, full of compassion,\\" and that \\"the result trembles with life.\\" Publisher's Weekly gave it a starred review and called it \\"a singular masterpiece.\\" Awards Ness and Kay won the Carnegie and Greenaway Medals for writing and illustration, recognising the year's best work published in the UK.

Semiotics of photography is the observation of symbolism used within photography or \\"reading\\" the picture. This article refers to realistic, unedited photographs not those that have been manipulated in any way. Roland Barthes was one of the first people to study the semiotics of images. He developed a way to understand the meaning of images. Most of Barthes' studies related to advertising, but his concepts can apply to photography as well. Denotation Denotation refers to the meaning hidden in symbols or images. A denotation is \\"what we see\\" in the picture or what is \\"there\\" in the picture. According to author Clive Scott, this is another way of saying that a photograph has both a signified and a referent, is both coded and encoded. This is to re-emphasize the co-existence of the iconic and idexical. In photography the photo itself is the signifier, the signified is what the image is or represents. The literal meaning of the image. Connotation Connotation (Semiotics) is arbitrary in that the meanings brought to the image are based on rules or conventions that the reader has learnt. Connotation attaches additional meaning to the first signifier, which is why the first signifier is often described in multiple words that include things like camera angle, color, lighting, etc. It is the immediate cultural meaning from what is seen in the picture, but not what is actually there. Connotation is what is implied by the image. Coded iconic According to Roland Barthes the coded iconic message is the story that the image portrays. This message is easily understood and the images represent a clear relationship. The \\"reader\\" of the image applies their knowledge to the encoding of the photo. An image of a bowl of fruit for example might imply still life, freshness or market stalls. Noncoded iconic Noncoded iconic is another part of Barthes' theory of understanding images. Noncoded has nothing to do with the emotions from the image as a whole. It is the \\"literal\\" denotation, the recognition of identifiable object in the photograph, irrespective of the larger societal code. Using the bowl of fruit example, this photograph is just that, a bowl of fruit. A non-coded iconic has no deeper meaning, the image is exactly what it shows.

Routledge Publishing, 90-111. 2011. Today, there are 350 bici stenciled images painted on buildings throughout Rosario, memorializing each of its 350 citizens who were disappeared under Argentina's military dictatorship and National Reorganization Process (1976‚Äì1983). Background For most members of the resistance, bicycles were the primary mode of transport. As Traverso's friends began disappearing after the 1976 coup d'etat of Isabel Mart√≠nez de Per√≥n and the ensuing Jorge Rafael Videla Redondo de facto presidency, only their bicycles would be left behind.http://www.lannan.org/art/art-grants/visiting-artists-fernando- traverso-and-lourdes-portillo/ Seeing an abandoned bicycle was often the first sign that its owner had been disappeared. These bicycles left standing in the streets of Rosario stood as memorials to those who were taken. Traverso made these memorials more permanent by spray painting the bici image on buildings throughout the city. Now, it has spread worldwide and Traverso works with many human rights organizations as well as impacted communities to raise awareness for those who are still disappearing today. Memory Art In the years following the Dirty War, Argentinians have dealt with the atrocities of the past in a myriad of ways. From the 1984 state-sponsored Nunca M√°s (Never Again) truth commission to commemoration museums, memories of Argentina's brutal dictatorial past have far from disappeared; rather the opposite, they have come to dominate various arenas of Argentine culture, most notably, Argentine memory art As exemplified through the successes of Traverso's bici graffiti art campaign, memory art has become an important symbolic means of negotiating the past, not only by the artist and the effected community, but the international population as well. Alongside Traverso's graffiti art, Rosario is also home to Argentina's first official Museum of Memory which offers a nuanced narration of the nations dictatorial past. Under the direction of Ruben Chababo, the Museum of Memory opened firstly in 2004, and then in a more permanent location in 2010. Since its original opening, issues of interpretation have been paramount in its organization. As a means to avoid the implied \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" connotations of a chronological portrayal, the Museum is organized by a series of aesthetics themes ranging from clandestine imprisonments to struggles in truth and justice. However, Chababo has remarked that Rosario's true memory art cannot be found in any institution, but rather in its streets. The Bici as memorial Bici bannerFernando Traverso's Bici image could originally only be found in the streets of Rosario, but has since become an international symbol remembering those who were disappeared under the various military dictatorships in Latin America, specifically during the 1970s.Reuter, Laurel. \\"The Disappeared.\\" In The Disappeared, Los Disaparecidos. 25-35.

Traverso visited the US-Mexico border from May 25 through June 1, 2009 to attend the inaugural event for the exhibition of The Disappeared. During his visit he met with and held workshops for students from the Universidad Autonoma de Ciudad Juarez (UACJ) in Juarez, Mexico and the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). Traverso, along with Rubin Center Assistant Director Kerry Doyle and UACJ Visual Arts Professor Leon de la Rosa, came up with Bicycles on the Border, an action using Traverso's bici image to respond to the current border realities. He held two daylong workshops at both universities, during which groups of students and community members printed images of bikes on large fabric banners. Those who participated in the action were encouraged to take the banners and take pictures of them in places along the border that evoke the ideas of disappearance, loss, or injustice that have come to be associated with the bici image. These photographs became his next project, El Nieto de Herminia (Herminia's Grandson). The image of the bici came to represent those who were disappeared. Family photos were taken with the bici in place of the missing relative. The original memorial started off small but \\"his art has spiraled outward, enmeshing more and more participants.\\" His most recent project involves numbering real bicycles. He is encouraging cyclists to rescue abandoned bikes that have waited for years to be picked up by their owners. Just as the younger Argentine generations are becoming active ‚Äì and demanding recognition for those who were disappeared ‚Äì so are Traverso's bicis. The bici images and everything this memorial has grown to incorporate serve as a continuous reminder of those who were disappeared. In Traverso's word's, \\"forgetting becomes the repressor's ultimate triumph.\\" See also *History of Argentina *National Reorganization Process *Dirty War *Operation Condor *National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP) *Human Rights in Argentina *Street art References External links *Traverso's Website *The Museum of Horrors *The Politics of Memory Museums (The Daily Beast) *Explanation of the bicycles painted in the streets of Rosario (in Spanish) Category:Culture in Rosario, Santa Fe Category:Graffiti and unauthorised signage Category:Public art Category:Street culture Category:National Reorganization Process Category:2001 works ","title":"Fernando Traverso's Bicis"},{"id":"33981111","text":"The Union County Courthouse is a courthouse in El Dorado, Arkansas, United States, the county seat of Union County, built in 1927.

Discovery and naming Partial skull in left side, front, and upper views Spinops is known from the holotype NHMUK R16307, a partial parietal bone, preserving most of the midline bar. Referred material include NHMUK R16308, a partial parietal bone, partial dentary and unidentifiable limb fragments, NHMUK R16306, an incomplete skull, preserving only the dorsal portion of the skull, and NHMUK R16309, a partial right squamosal. None of this material was found in articulation, however it was all closely associated in the same bone bed, in the northwestern region (\\"Steveville Badlands\\") of the Dinosaur Provincial Park. Fossils of Spinops were first found in 1916, and were housed in the Natural History Museum in London. The material was not described until 2011, when the new species Spinops sternbergorum was erected. The material was probably collected from the upper part of the Oldman Formation or the lower part of the Dinosaur Park Formation, dating to the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. Two partials skulls of Spinops were found in 1916, in a large bone bed near the Red Deer River of southern Alberta, by American commercial fossil collector Charles Hazelius Sternberg and his son Levi Sternberg. The fossils were sent to the Natural History Museum in London (then called the British Museum (Natural History)), which had financed the expedition. The museum considered the fossils too fragmentary to display, leaving them unprepared in the collections. In a letter to Charles H. Sternberg, English paleontologist Arthur Smith Woodward of the British Museum called the Spinops material \\"nothing but rubbish\\". The precise whereabouts of the bonebed that yielded the fossils is unknown due to poor field record keeping, but Darren Tanke of the Royal Tyrrell Museum is spearheading attempts at its relocation. The fossils were re-examined in 2011 by a team led by Dr Andrew A. Farke; which realized that the fossils represented an entirely new species of dinosaur. Spinops was first named by Andrew A. Farke, Michael J. Ryan, Paul M. Barrett, Darren H. Tanke, Dennis R. Braman, Mark A. Loewen, and Mark R. Graham in 2011; the type species is Spinops sternbergorum. The generic name is derived from Latin spina, \\"spine\\", and Greek ops, \\"face\\", in reference to the unique ornamentation on the face. The specific name honours Charles H. and Levi Sternberg.

The state authorities elevated Proctor to the rank of colonel and charged him to recruit an eight-company Pennsylvania State Artillery Regiment a month later. In June 1777 Proctor's Continental Artillery Regiment officially became part of the Continental Army. He played an important role in the battles of Brandywine and Germantown in 1777 and at Monmouth in 1778. He went on the Sullivan Expedition against the Iroquois Nation in 1779. His regiment was renamed the 4th Continental Artillery Regiment in August 1779. He took guns into action at Bull's Ferry in 1780. The hot-tempered Proctor often quarreled with the Pennsylvania civil authorities and this led him to resign from the army in April 1781. Proctor served as county sheriff of Philadelphia in 1783‚Äì1785 and City Lieutenant of Philadelphia in 1790. Secretary of War Henry Knox named him to go on a peace mission in 1791 to the Native American tribes near Lake Erie. Proctor was appointed a brigadier general of militia in 1793 and the following year was sent to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion. In 1798 he became a major general of militia. He died at Philadelphia in March 1806, having outlived his second wife by two years. Early career Proctor was born in County Longford, Ireland in 1739. With his parents Francis and Betsey Proctor, he moved first to Nova Scotia and then to the American colonies. At some point in the 1750s he took up the carpenter's trade. The year 1759 found him at Fort Pitt where he met the Seneca chief Captain Joseph Hays.Bluemink, Col. Thomas Proctor He married Mary Fox on December 31, 1766 in Philadelphia. They would have two children, Anna (d. 1858) and Thomas (1784‚Äì1861). Proctor had a younger brother Francis Jr. who was born in the 1750s and died in 1814.Bluemink, Six Generations of Proctors In 1772, he joined the Carpenter's Guild in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and remained a member until his death. American Revolution 1775‚Äì1777 Henry Knox After the outbreak of the American Revolution, the state of Pennsylvania authorized an artillery company on October 16, 1775. Proctor asked the state Council of Safety to appoint him captain on October 27 and his request was immediately granted. While other state troops were sent to the Flying Camp (reserve), the artillery company was retained near Philadelphia to defend Fort Island. At first, Proctor's company mustered only 25 men but it increased to 100 by May 1776. A muster roll from July 31, 1776 showed Proctor's company numbering 114 soldiers. The staff included one captain-lieutenant, one first lieutenant, one second lieutenant, one lieutenant fireworker, one quartermaster sergeant, and one clerk. The company also counted three sergeants, three corporals, eight bombardiers, 24 gunners, 69 matrosses, six musicians, five drummers, and one fifer. The gunners served on the USS Hornet (10) during an engagement with the British HMS Roebuck (44). Pleased with the gunners' performance, the state added a second artillery company to create the Pennsylvania State Artillery Battalion on 14 August 1776. At the time, John Martin Strobaugh was appointed captain of the 1st Company, Thomas Forrest became captain of the 2nd Company, and Proctor was promoted to major. Proctor vigorously recruited enough gunners and matrosses to fill both companies. The Pennsylvania State Artillery Battalion transferred to George Washington's main army on 23 September. In October the state re-enrolled the soldiers for the duration of the war. On December 22, 1776, Forrest's 2nd Company mustered with Washington's army in the strength of two officers and 50 men with two brass 6-pounders. In the Battle of Trenton four days later the battery is said to have two 5¬Ω-inch howitzers in addition to the pair of 6-pounders. Together with two guns under Alexander Hamilton and three guns under Sebastian Baumann, Forrest's guns dominated King Street with their fire and silenced the two Hessian cannons opposing them. In the Battle of the Assunpink Creek on January 2, 1777, Forrest had six cannons supporting a 1,000-man delaying force under Edward Hand. The American artillery commander Henry Knox stated that he had \\"30 to 40\\" guns at Assunpink Creek. These included 18‚Äì19 guns guarding the bridge, 12 guns at the upper fords and several more at the lower fords. The next day, Proctor led his artillerists at the Battle of Princeton. After the engagement, he added a captured British brass 6-pounder cannon to his battery. Since he did not have enough horses to haul an additional piece, he left behind an old iron 3-pounder cannon. A French de Valli√®re 4-pounder barrel from the American Revolutionary War rests on an American Civil War gun carriage. When Knox went on leave on January 17, 1777, he appointed Proctor temporary commander of the army's artillery. Proctor capably performed this duty, though some Continental officers were annoyed that a man with a state commission was elevated above them. On February 6, 1777 the battalion was expanded into the Pennsylvania State Artillery Regiment, with orders to recruit eight companies from the eastern part of the state. The new regiment was detached from the main army. Proctor accepted promotion to colonel commanding the regiment on February 20. A company from the regiment was roughly handled at the Battle of Bound Brook on April 13, losing two cannons, two officers and about 20 men captured. On June 10, 1777 the state regiment became Proctor's Continental Artillery Regiment and first transferred to the Middle Department before being attached to the main army a few weeks later on July 14. Washington ordered Proctor's regiment to Trenton, New Jersey to join Francis Nash's brigade where it arrived about July 24. After getting news of the British landing in Chesapeake Bay, Nash's troops and Proctor's gunners were instructed to move to Chester, Pennsylvania on August 22. During the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, Proctor's Pennsylvania Artillery manned a 4-gun lunette on a knoll that overlooked Chadds Ford. Two of the guns were French-made 4-pounders, another was a 3-pounder Hessian prize that was rebored as a 6-pounder and the last was an 8-inch howitzer cast in Philadelphia. At 8:00‚Äì9:00 am an artillery duel began between the American guns and the British artillery on the west side of Brandywine Creek. Sometime afterward, Washington conferred with Proctor on how things were going. At 5:30 pm the British mounted a major assault across the creek. Firing canister shot, Proctor's guns caused considerable casualties before the British successfully stormed the lunette. The Americans claimed to have saved two of the cannons. During the Battle of Germantown on October 4, 1777, the American first wave encountered 100‚Äì120 men of the British 40th Regiment of Foot shut up in the Benjamin Chew House and flowed around the obstacle. When the reserves arrived, Knox convinced Washington that the place must be captured. Two cannons of Proctor's Artillery plus two captured British 6-pounders were already firing at the building. Staff officer Timothy Pickering suggested that the guns be brought to bear on the front of the building, so this was done. The front doors were quickly blown open and the shutters splintered but unknown to the gunners the front of the house was constructed of stone two feet thick, impervious to light cannons. For two hours, the guns blasted the masonry with round shot or fired canister at the second story, but all American infantry attacks were repulsed with heavy losses. 1778‚Äì1783 Replica cannons can be seen at the Artillery Park in Valley Forge. On February 27, 1778, Washington wrote from Valley Forge that Proctor's Regiment suffered \\"considerable\\" casualties in the 1777 campaign and serious desertion since. Because of the weakness of his artillery arm, Washington ordered Harrison's Artillery Regiment to join him at Valley Forge. At the Battle of Monmouth on 28 June 1778, Proctor led 12 guns in William Alexander, Lord Stirling's wing which was in Washington's main body. After Charles Lee's advance guard was driven back at mid-day, the advancing British encountered the American main body. There were five infantry brigades in line with two detachments covering the left and another infantry brigade screening the right. Under the direction of Knox, the 12 guns were massed in a large battery on the forward slope of Perrine's Ridge about 1:00‚Äì1:30 pm. The American 6-pounders and 4-pounders engaged in an inconclusive 2-hour artillery duel with a British concentration that included two 12-pounders, six 6-pounders and two 5¬Ω-inch howitzers. When four American cannons under Thomas- Antoine de Mauduit du Plessis took the British gun line in enfilade from Comb's Hill about 3:00 pm, British army commander Henry Clinton ordered a withdrawal. By August 4, 1778, Proctor's Regiment counted only 220 men, so a few weeks later he applied to the Pennsylvania Council to enlist men from other states and it was granted. The regiment was finally accepted into the Continental Army on September 3. Until this time, the unit belonged to Pennsylvania even though it served with the Continental Army. There were frequent clashes between President Joseph Reed and Proctor over the matter of supplies. At this time Proctor demanded new uniforms which were supposed to be black for the artillery, but he insisted on letting his officers wear blue coats. Reed complained to Washington and it was determined that Proctor officers must conform to the new uniform policy in the following year. Reed remarked that Proctor only recognized the authority of Pennsylvania when he needed a favor. On May 18, 1779 Congress finally commissioned Proctor as colonel in the Continental Army. Joseph Reed often clashed with Proctor. Proctor went on the Sullivan Expedition against the Iroquois Nation. He accompanied John Sullivan's 2,500-man main column with four 3-pounders, two 6-pounders and two howitzers. A force of Iroquois and Butler's Rangers tried to ambush the Americans in the Battle of Newtown on August 29, 1779. When the enemy presence was discovered, Sullivan launched an enveloping attack. Proctor's guns opened fire and some of the howitzer shells exploded in the rear of the enemy position. Thinking that the Americans were attacking from behind, many of the Iroquois immediately ran away. The remaining warriors and the Rangers eventually retreated before the numerically superior Americans, but casualties were few on both sides. The expedition ruined the Iroquois Nation by wrecking their towns and burning their crops, but it did not stop the warriors from attacking American settlements. Proctor's Regiment was renamed the 4th Continental Artillery Regiment on August 10, 1779. Congress recommissioned Proctor as colonel on April 21, 1780. Under the command of Anthony Wayne he was present at the Battle of Bull's Ferry on July 20. The cattle raid was successful but the Americans were unable to storm a blockhouse manned by Loyalists despite a bombardment by four cannons. Proctor's role is known because British Major John Andr√© penned a satirical poem about the battle called the Cow Chace that mentioned the American artilleryman. Infuriated over the Pennsylvania Council's promotion of officers without his approval, Proctor tendered his resignation on April 9, 1781. Reed wrote to Washington that he was pleased to be rid of such a difficult officer. Washington wrote a letter to Proctor accepting his resignation as follows. \\"I am sorry to find that the situation of your domestic affairs renders it necessary for you to quit the service. It always gives me pain to part with an officer, but particularly so with one whose experience and attention have made him useful in his profession. I cannot in justice to you permit you to leave the army without expressing my approbation of your conduct upon every occasion since you joined me in 1776, and wish you success in the line of life which you have now embraced.\\" From December 25, 1782 to October 22, 1783 Proctor held a commission from Congress as major. Later career Proctor served as sheriff of Philadelphia County from October 20, 1783 to October 14, 1785. His wife Mary died on July 15, 1789. He was appointed as City Lieutenant of Philadelphia on September 10, 1790 to fill a vacancy. On March 10, 1791, Knox, now Secretary of War appointed him to go on a peace mission to the Wabash and Miami tribes near Lake Erie. Proctor left two days later and spent two months among the Native Americans. Governor Thomas Mifflin appointed Proctor a major of artillery on May 17, 1792 and brigadier general of militia on April 12, 1793. Proctor was given command of a brigade of 1,849 men to put down the Whiskey Rebellion on August 7, 1794. Proctor married Sarah Ann Hussey on March 3, 1796 and they had one child, Mary (d. 1842). He was named major general of militia on June 7, 1796. He experienced financial difficulties, especially in getting compensation for expenses from the state of Pennsylvania. For example, he was not reimbursed for a horse that was killed at Brandywine until 1793. Proctor died at his home on Arch Street between Fourth and Fifth in Philadelphia on March 16, 1806 and he was buried at Saint Paul's Episcopal Church on Third Street. His second wife Sarah preceded him in death on March 23, 1804. He was a Freemason and founding member of the Society of the Cincinnati in Pennsylvania.

Makar magazine produced four issues a year and from 1972 onward one issue was replaced with three small books from the Gargoyle Poets Series. The series consisted of thirty-seven books of poetry between twenty and thirty-six pages in length. \\"Makar was established in 1960 as a student run magazine of the English Society of the University of Queensland. Taking its title from the middle-Scots word for maker, it published poetry, fiction, drama and criticism. Graham Rowlands was appointed editor soon after the magazine changed to a smaller format in 1966. Then, in 1968, Martin Duwell was appointed editor, beginning his long association with the magazine. By the early 1970s the poetry published in Makar had evolved, according to Robert Habost in his 1982 assessment for Image, 'from the \\"gushy\\", \\"high flying\\", imagistic, traditional rhyming verse' of the early 1960s 'to ... stark, concise, condensed verse'. Makar also conducted a significant series of interviews with contemporary writers, some of which were published in A Possible Contemporary Poetry (1982). In his introduction to this volume, Duwell imagined the Makar audience as 'reasonably intelligent, willing, but puzzled' about the 'profound and acrimonious disagreement about the nature and role of poetry and language'. It was to such debates that Makar addressed itself.

The first lap was a 185 km journey along the Eastern Bengal State Railway from Calcutta Station (later renamed Sealdah) to Damookdeah Ghat on the southern bank of the Padma River, then across the river in a ferry and the second lap of the journey. A 336 km metre gauge line of the North Bengal Railway linked Saraghat on the northern bank of the Padma to Siliguri. The 1.8 km long Hardinge Bridge across the Padma came up in 1912. Presently, it is between the Paksey and Bheramara stations on the broad gauge line between Darshana and Parbatipur in Bangladesh. In 1926 the metre gauge section north of the bridge was converted to broad gauge, and so the entire Calcutta-Siliguri route became broad gauge. The route thus ran: Sealdah‚ÄìRanaghat‚ÄìBheramara‚ÄìHardinge Bridge‚ÄìIswardi‚ÄìSantahar‚ÄìHili‚ÄìParabtipur‚ÄìNilphamari‚ÄìHaldibari‚ÄìJalpaiguri‚ÄìSiliguri. Post-partition development With the partition of India in 1947, a major portion of the Calcutta-Siliguri line ran through East Pakistan, now Bangladesh. With several rail links in Bihar, the attention was on those links, and new links were developed. However, one hurdle stood out. There was no bridge across the Ganga river even in Bihar. A generally acceptable route to Siliguri was via Sahibganj Loop to Sakrigali ghat. Across the Ganges by ferry to Manihari Ghat. Then metre gauge via Katihar and Barsoi to Kishanganj and finally narrow gauge to Sliguri. In 1949 Kishanganj-Siliguri section was converted to metre gauge. In the early 1960s, when Farakka Barrage was being constructed, a far reaching change was made. Indian Railways constructed a new broad-gauge rail link from south Bengal. New Jalpaiguri, a new broad gauge station was built south of Siliguri Town. The long wide broad gauge line was constructed from Khejuriaghat, on the north bank of the Padma to Malda between 1959 and 1963. The long Farakka Barrage carries a rail-cum-road bridge across the Ganges. The rail bridge was opened in 1971 thereby linking the Barharwa- Azimganj-Katwa loop to Malda Town, New Jalpaiguri and other railway stations in North Bengal. Reorganisation in the Siliguri area The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway came up as a narrow gauge (2 feet) railway in 1881. In 1915, it was extended up the Teesta Valley to Gielle Kola and to the south to Kishenganj. In 1949 Kishanganj - Siliguri was converted from narrow-gauge to metre-gauge and extended north-east into Assam, partly along the narrow-gauge Teesta Valley route. Along with development of the metre gauge line, a new Siliguri Junction station, north of the traditional Siliguri Town station, became the main station in the area. With the development of the broad gauge system and the New Jalpaiguri station, the narrow gauge DHR was extended to New Jalpaiguri. The earlier Siliguri-Kishanganj metre gauge line is now part of the Siliguri-Kishnaganj-Katihar metre gauge line. Part of the metre gauge track runs parallel to the broad gauge track and part of it has a separate route. The Siliguri-Haldibari, part of the original broad gauge Calcutta- Siliguri track via Hardinge Bridge, got delinked from the trunk route because of partition in 1947. As all the other tracks in the area were metre gauge, it was converted from broad gauge to mere gauge in the late forties. When New Jalpaiguri station came up, the line was extended to New Jalpiguri. When broad gauge lines were laid in the area, it was reconverted to broad gauge and now functions as the Haldibari-New Jalpaiguri Line. Assam link The railway system in Assam got delinked from the rest of India in 1947. In order to establish a link with Assam, the Assam Rail Link Project, connecting Kishanganj with Fakirgram was started on a war footing on 26 January 1948. A 229 km long metre gauge line was built and commissioned in two years. The Kishanganj branch of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was taken over and converted to metre gauge. It was connected to the North Eastern Railway network at Barsoi. The Teesta Valley Line up to Sivok was taken over and converted to metre gauge. The link spanned three major rivers - Teesta, Torsha, and Sankosh . The Kishanganj-Naxalbari section was completed on 31 July 1948, the Naxalbari-New Bagrakot section on 26 January 1950, the Madarihat-Hashimara section on 25 December 1949 and Alipurduar-Fakirgram section on 26 January 1950. In the seventies a new broad gauge line was laid between New Jalpaiguri and Guwahati. The entire Barauni-Katihar-Guwahati line is being electrified. Branch lines The Katihar-Barsoi-Raiganj-Radhikapur- Dinajpur-Parabatipur line is now operated on the Indian side up to Radhikapur only. The transit facility in the Radhikapur-Birol sector is virtually closed. The railway track on the Indian side has been converted to broad gauge while that on the Bangladesh side remains metre gauge. The Old Maldah-Rajshahi section is used up to Singhabad on the Indian side. Bangladesh started export of fertilizer to Nepal utilizing the Rahanpur-Singhabad transit point in November 2011. The long Eklakhi‚ÄìBalurghat broad gauge line was opened in 2004. Extension of the Eklakhi-Balurghat branch line to Hili was announced in the Rail Budget for 2010-11.

Taxonomy The taxon was erected by Danish marine biologist Paul Lassenius Kramp in 1938 to accommodate certain families of hydrozoans with biphasic life histories. It includes genera with medusae with ecto-endodermal statocysts and with gonads alongside their radial canals, and also genera which have polyps that are not covered by a theca. Molecular analysis performed by Collins in 2006 has since shown that the Limnomedusae are not monophylic. The family Armorhydridae, which contains a single genus and a single species, Armorhydra janowiczi, is found living in coarse sediment, has hollow tentacles and has no radial canals. It seems to share few morphological features with the other families and probably belongs elsewhere. The inclusion of Microhydrulidae is also dubious.

The housing scheme based on 'income groups'  In the original plan of this colony, the housing regions where divided into three based on the income group of the potential occupants, and houses were built in these regions on four different formats, for four different income groups. It may be now perceived a quite unaesthetic, or unpolitical, but these houses were, in fact, named to bear the category of these income groups. They were named: EWS (Economically Weak Section), LIG (Lower Income Group), MIG (Middle Income Group), and HIG (High Income Group). Although the expansions of these abbreviations are now forgotten, these houses still bear these abbreviations in their house numbers. The same scheme was followed in Panampilly Nagar and Changampuzha Nagar (KSHB) as well. Even though the same format of housing was replication in later projects of GDCA like the South Commercial, and in Kakkanad, the income group based naming was not followed.  In popular culture  * Gandhinagar 2nd Street, a 1986 Malayalam film directed by Sathyan Anthikad had name of this colony as its title.

The immediate crisis centered on insufficient railroad capacity developed by the private sector, and competing but neglected inland shipping, the navigation of which had been deemed under federal purview since 1824. The temporary commission lasted until the end of Roosevelt's presidency, but his conservationist progressive interest was focused more than on transportation alone. The president wanted water projects to be considered for their multiple uses and in relation to other natural resources and asked for a comprehensive plan for the improvement and control of the river systems of the United States. Based on long-established legislative structure and more recent bureaucratic additions, the appointed members of the commission included, elected Representative Theodore E. Burton (R OH), as chairman, being also chair of the House Committee on Rivers and Harbors; Senator Francis G. Newlands (D NV), as vice-chair; Senator William Warner (R MO), and Senator John H. Bankhead (D AL). Non-elected commissioners included government technocrats with experience in related fields, including Alexander Mackenzie, Chiefs of Engineers, US Army, and the entity involved in federal navigation improvements since the beginning; William John McGee, as secretary and from the United States Geological Survey; Frederick Haynes Newell, the first Director of the United States Reclamation Service; Gifford Pinchot, the first Chief of the United States Forest Service, and Herbert Knox Smith, from the Bureau of Corporations and predecessor to the Federal Trade Commission. By the end of that year, after the commission had looked at shipping on the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes, a minority of its members concluded that the nation needed a comprehensive water resources policy along with an autonomous commission of experts to plan and construct water projects that embraced entire river basins. At the end of 1907, and before Roosevelt presented the commission's preliminary report to Congress in late February, Senator Newlands introduced the first bill to create a permanent commission. Over the next decade the subject of hydroelectricity would be closely studied, while Newlands drafted several more bills, with only an emasculated version becoming law in 1917. While supportive of the commission's report generally, most members of Congress considered Newlands's plan either impractical or unconstitutional. Three years later, Congress all but eliminated the hope of centralized water planning when it replaced the Inland Waterways Commission with the Federal Power Commission, following passage of the Federal Water Power Act of 1920.Donald J. Pisani, Water Planning in the Progressive Era: The Inland Waterways Commission Reconsidered, Journal of Policy History 18.4 (2006) pp.389-418 Presidential charge On March 14, 1907, President Roosevelt appointed the Inland Waterway Commissioners and charged them to prepare and report \\"a comprehensive plan for the improvement and control of the river systems of the United States.\\"Instrument of the President, March 14, 1907. He was influenced, he said, by broad considerations of national policy, and the corresponding responsibilities and obligations, since the control of navigable waterways lies within the federal purview. He noted that while private sector energies had been directed largely toward industrial development in connection with field and forest, coal and iron, some of these material and power resources may already be largely depleted or abused. At the same time, the government's inland waterways have received scant attention as a whole, and it was becoming clear that the nation's streams should be considered and conserved as great natural resources. So far, works designed to control the waterways have usually been undertaken for a single purpose in mind, such as the improvement of navigation, the development of power, the irrigation of arid lands, the protection of lowlands from floods, or to supply water for domestic and manufacturing purposes. While the people's rights to these and similar water uses must be respected, the time had come, he said, for local projects and uses of the inland waters to be viewed in a more comprehensive plan, designed for the benefit of the entire country; such a plan should consider and include all the uses to which streams may be put, and should bring together and coordinate the points of view of all water users. While the task involved in the full and orderly development and control of the nation's river systems is a great one, it is certainly not too great for the government to approach, especially with results which seem to promise even greater returns. The Commission's appointment followed numerous petitions from commercial organizations in the Mississippi Valley asking for such study, and he said, \\"the common knowledge that the railroads of the United States are no longer able to move crops and manufactures rapidly enough to secure the prompt transaction of the business of the nation, and there is small prospect of immediate relief.\\" During the previous ten years, while the production of the northern interior States had doubled, the railroad facilities to transport it had increased only about 12%; there was reason to doubt railroad development could keep transportation abreast of production in the near-term. \\"There appears to be but one complete remedy ‚Äî the development of a complementary system of transportation by water. The present congestion affects chiefly the people of the Mississippi Valley, and they demand relief. When the congestion of which they complain is relieved, the whole Nation will share the good results.\\" Roosevelt noted that while the nation's rivers are natural resources of first rank, they are also liable to become destructive agencies, endangering life and property; and that some of our most notable engineering enterprises have grown from the effort to control them. The vast quantity of annual suspended sediment and an enormous but unmeasured amount of earth-salts and soil-matter carried in solution not only causes the Mississippi channels to clog and flood the lowlands of the lower river, but also renders the flow variable and difficult to control. Furthermore, he noted, the sediment and soil-matter is composed of the most fertile material of the fields and pastures drained by the tributaries. \\"Any plan for utilizing our inland waterways should consider floods and their control by forests and other means; the protection of bottom-lands from injury by overflow, and up-lands from loss by soil-wash; the physics of sediment-charged waters and the physical or other ways of purifying them; the construction of dams and locks, not only to facilitate navigation but to control the character and movement of the waters; and should look to the full use and control of our running waters and the complete \\"artificialization\\" of our waterways for the benefit of citizens as a whole.\\" Not being possible to properly frame so large a plan for the control of rivers without taking account of the orderly development of other natural resources, Roosevelt asked that the Inland Waterways Commission consider the relations of the streams to the use of all the great permanent natural resources and their conservation to make and maintain prosperous homes. Roosevelt noted that any feasible plan for utilizing inland waterways should recognize both the existing federal means, including the Departments of War, Interior, Agriculture, and Commerce and Labor, and those in the States and their subdivisions. Also it must not involve unduly burdensome expenditures from the national Treasury. The cost necessarily will be large and proportional to the magnitude of potential benefits to the people, but it will be small in comparison to the $17 billion in current capital investments for steam railways nationally. That amount would have seemed enormous and incredible a half a century earlier, yet that investment was a continuous source of profit to the people. Without it, the nation's industrial progress would have been impossible. In closing the President said that, the questions before the Inland Waterways Commission must necessarily relate to every part of the United States and affect every interest within its borders. Its plans should be considered in light of the widest modern knowledge of the country and its people, and from the most diverse points of view. As the committee's work sufficiently advanced, he would add more consulting members to the Commission, and ask that its recommendations be fully discussed with him, before they were submitted. The Commission's report should include both a general statement of the problems, as well as recommendations concerning the manner and means of attacking the problems perceived by them. Proceedings After initial conference and correspondence the organizational meeting was held in Washington DC from April 29 to May 3, 1907. A second meeting and inspection trip on the Mississippi River from St. Louis to the Passes was held May 13 to May 23. A third meeting and inspection trip took place from September 21 to October 13, which traveled on the Great Lakes from Cleveland to Duluth, on the Mississippi from St. Paul to Memphis, and on the Missouri River from Kansas City to St. Louis. A fourth meeting was held in the capitol beginning on November 25, for the purpose of preparing a preliminary report; the commission ended February 3, 1908. During the organizational and inspecting meetings, thirty formal sessions were held in addition to informal meetings and conferences. At several of these sessions the entire Commission were present; at no session were there fewer than five Commissioners; the average attendance was over seven. During the meetings for report preparation there were 27 sessions, with an average attendance of seven. Experts on matters entrusted to the Commission were present by invitation at 24 sessions; of these experts there were 24, several of whom attended two or more sessions, with most being former or current attaches of the Corps of Engineers. Outside formal sessions, the Commissioners devoted much time to the consideration of the waterways and related matters. Two or three Commissioners jointly inspected the upper Missouri, the Columbia and Snake, the Sacramento and San Joaquin, and major tributaries; several Commissioners employed agencies under their direction in collating and digesting data relating to canals, water transportation, etc. Most of the Commissioners attended conventions and other meetings connected with the development of waterways and related interests. At the 18th session a special committee of one, Gen. Alexander MacKenzie, was appointed to prepare a list of statutes and considerations relating to water power, especially generation of hydroelectricity. Following action at the 23rd session, with the President presiding, a letter requesting a conference on the conservation of natural resources was framed and presented to the President on October 4, 1907; this later resulted in the first Conference of Governors. At the twenty-fifth session a committee of three was appointed to communicate further with the President on this matter, and to prepare a preliminary draft of their report; both committees reported at the fourth meeting.Preliminary Report of the Inland Waterways Commission, Proceedings Commission report The investigations and discussions of the Inland Waterways Commission resulted in a series of 'Findings', containing their statements of fact connected with navigation and other uses of the inland waterways nationally, 'Recommendations', containing their conclusions on those findings, 'Inquiries in progress', containing certain matters still under discussion and an extensive 'Appendix'.

Included in its 125 fully restored cars were: Stanley Steamers, Duesenbergs and Jaguars. The facility also included an extensive automobile library. Closure In 2018 the museum announced that it would close it doors. The reason given for its closing was to help provide funding for the newly established division Dick's Classic Garage. Ninety of the cars were taken to auction. The remainder of the cars in the collection were moved to Dick's Classic Garage. The plan was to be able to provide funding for the new museum much longer than income from admissions taken would sustain.

Likelihood of confusion plays a central role in trade-mark registration, infringement and passing-off. Whether a trade-mark or trade-name is confusing is a question of fact. The role of confusion in trade-mark law is analogous to the role of substantial infringement in patent law. Definition Section 6 of the Trademarks Act sets out the situations where a trade-mark is confusing: The essence of confusion is the inference of common source. In other words, Trade- mark A will be confusing with Trade-mark B if the use of both trade-marks in the same area will lead consumers to believe that the goods or services sold under either trade-mark originate from the same source. Statutory Factors Section 6(5) of the Trademarks Act provides that in determining whether there is confusion, a court must examine \\"all of the surrounding circumstances\\" including: The factors under section 6(5) are not exhaustive.Gainers Inc. v. Marchildon (1996), 66 C.P.R. (3d) 308 (F.C.T.D.) Also, given the factual nature of confusion, the particular factors considered and the weighing of the factors varies from case-to-case. Degree of Resemblance Determining the degree of resemblance between the trade-marks is the starting point of a confusion analysis. The assessment of resemblance under s. 6(5)(e) is not limited to similarities in the appearance of the trade-marks. Similar sounding word marks can be confusing, even if they appear to be different. Word marks representing similar ideas can be confusing (e.g. \\"Smoothies\\" and \\"Smarties\\" in the context of candies). Standard of Comparison In determining the degree of resemblance between the trade-marks, a court will examine each trade-mark as a whole, rather than breaking it up into its individual elements. For example, in Molson Companies Ltd. v. John Labatt Ltd., the Federal Court of Appeal compared the trade-marks \\"Molson Golden\\" and \\"Winchester Gold\\" in their entirety.Molson Companies Ltd. v. John Labatt Ltd. (1994), 58 C.P.R. (3d) 527 Although both trade-marks used the descriptive \\"Gold\\" or \\"Golden\\", when viewed as a whole, the trade-marks were sufficiently distinguishable that there was no reasonable likelihood of confusion. \\"Ordinary Casual Consumer Somewhat in a Hurry\\" In a leading case on confusion, Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc., the Supreme Court of Canada stated that the appropriate standard of comparison is that of the \\"ordinary casual consumer somewhat in a hurry\\". In applying this standard, a court will ask whether a consumer of average intelligence and caution casually encountering both trade-marks in the marketplace would be likely to confuse them. Actual Evidence of Confusion In addition to predicting whether an \\"ordinary casual consumer somewhat in a hurry\\" would perceive confusion, a court may also consider evidence of actual confusion of the trade-marks in the marketplace. Although evidence of actual confusion is not necessary, the presence or absence of actual confusion in the marketplace may be a relevant \\"surrounding circumstance\\" under s. 6(5) of the Trade-marks Act.Mattel, par. 55 Distinctiveness Marks consisting of everyday words or expressions are inherently less distinctive than ones based on invented or coined words or expressions. However, a mark based on an everyday word may nonetheless acquire distinctiveness if it is employed extensively. In Mattel, the Court found that although Mattel‚Äôs \\"Barbie\\" trade-mark was based on an every day word, it had acquired substantial distinctiveness through its strong association with the company's doll products.Mattel, par. 75 Trade-marks in Different Businesses Although section 6(2) of the Trade-marks Act provides that there can be confusion \\"whether or not the wares or service are of the same general class\\", differences in the types of goods or services associated with each trade-mark are a relevant consideration in determining confusion.Mattel, par. 51 In Mattel, the Supreme Court found it unlikely that consumers would confuse \\"Barbie\\" for dolls with \\"Barbie\\" for restaurants.Mattel, par. 83 Similarly, in Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin v. Boutiques Cliquot Lt√©e, the Supreme Court of Canada found that the use of \\"Cliquot\\" for mid-market women‚Äôs clothing stores was not confusing with \\"Veuve Clicquot\\" as a mark for a famous brand of champagne. While it is possible for a famous trade-mark holder to argue that its trade-mark will expand into new lines of business, there must a reasonable basis for this prediction.

The accounts of the Gospels, including the empty tomb and the appearances of the risen Jesus to his followers, have been interpreted and analyzed in diverse ways, and have been seen variously as historical accounts of a literal event, as accurate accounts of visionary experiences, as non- literal eschatological parables, and as fabrications of early Christian writers, among various other interpretations. It has been suggested, for example, that Jesus did not die on the cross, that the empty tomb was the result of Jesus' body having been stolen, or, as was common with Roman crucifixions, that Jesus was never entombed. Post-Enlightenment historians work with methodological naturalism,McGrew, Timothy, \\"Miracles\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/miracles/ Flew, Antony, 1966, God and Philosophy, London: Hutchinson. Ehrman, Bart D., 2003, The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings, 3rd ed., New York: Oxford University Press. Bradley, Francis Herbert, 1874, ‚ÄúThe Presuppositions of Critical History,‚Äù in Collected Essays, vol. 1, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1935. McGrew's conclusion: historians work with methodological naturalism, which precludes them from establishing miracles as objective historical facts (Flew 1966: 146; cf. Bradley 1874/1935; Ehrman 2003: 229). and therefore reject miracles as objective historical facts.  Origin: Cultural and theological background  Resurrection and the afterlife of the soul Of the three main Jewish sects of the 1st century AD, the Sadducees held that both soul and body perished at death, the Essenes that the soul was immortal but the flesh was not, and the Pharisees that the soul was immortal and that the body would be resurrected to house it. Of these three positions, Jesus and the early Christians appear to have been closest to that of the Pharisees. Resurrection was available to the righteous alone, and would make them equal to the angels, as the Gospels have Jesus tell: \\"Those who are accounted worthy ... to the resurrection from the dead ... are equal to the angels and are children of God...\\" (Mark 12:24-25, Luke 20:34-36). Nor would the resurrected body be one of flesh and blood, but an immortal fleshless body of the same celestial nature as the sun, moon and stars. Jews did not believe that the dead could enter Heaven ‚Äì mankind's place was the earth, and heaven was for God and the heavenly beings. The Greeks held a similar view, but they also held that a man of exceptional merit could be exalted as a god after his death. The successors of Alexander the Great made this idea very well known throughout the Middle East, in particular through coins bearing his image ‚Äì a privilege previously reserved for gods ‚Äì and although originally foreign to the Romans, the doctrine was soon borrowed by the emperors for purposes of political propaganda. According to the theology of Imperial Roman apotheosis, the earthly body of the recently deceased emperor vanished, he received a new and divine one in its place, and was then seen by credible witnesses. Thus, in a story similar to the Gospel appearances of the resurrected Jesus and the commissioning of the disciples, Romulus, the founder of Rome, descended from the sky to command a witness to bear a message to the Romans regarding the city's greatness (\\"Declare to the Romans the will of Heaven that my Rome shall be the capital of the world...\\") before being taken up on a cloud. The experiences of the risen Christ attested by the earliest written sources ‚Äì the \\"primitive Church\\" creed of 1 Corinthians 15:3-5, in 1 Corinthians 15:8 and Galatians 1:16 ‚Äì are ecstatic rapture events and \\"invasions of heaven\\". A physical resurrection was unnecessary for this visionary mode of seeing the risen Christ, but the general movement of subsequent New Testament literature is towards the physical nature of the resurrection. This development is linked to the changing make-up of the Christian community: Paul the Apostle and the earliest Christ followers were Jewish, and Second Temple Judaism emphasised the life of the soul; the gospel writers, in an overwhelmingly Greco-Roman church, stressed instead the pagan belief in the hero who is immortalised and deified in his physical body. In this Hellenistic resurrection paradigm Jesus dies, is buried, and his body disappears (with witnesses to the empty tomb); he then returns in an immortalised physical body, able to appear and disappear at will like a god, and returns to the heavens which are now his proper home. Theological considerations The earliest Jewish followers of Jesus (the Jewish Christians) understood him as the son of man in the Jewish sense, a human who, through his perfect obedience to God's will, was resurrected and exalted to heaven in readiness to return as the son of man (the figure from Daniel 7), ushering in and ruling over the Kingdom of God. Paul has already moved away from this apocalyptic tradition towards a position where Christology and soteriology take precedence: Jesus is no longer the one who proclaims the message of the imminently coming Kingdom, he actually is the kingdom, the one in whom the kingdom of God is already present. This is also the message of Mark, a gentile writing for a church of gentile Christians, for whom Jesus as \\"Son of God\\" has become a divine being whose suffering, death and resurrection are essential to God's plan for redemption. Matthew presents Jesus' appearance in Galilee (Matthew 28:19-20) as a Greco-Roman apotheosis, the human body transformed to make it fitting for paradise. He goes beyond the ordinary Greco-Roman forms, however, by having Jesus claim \\"all authority ... in heaven and on earth\\" (28:18) ‚Äì a claim no Roman hero would dare make ‚Äì while charging the apostles to bring the whole world into a divine community of righteousness and compassion. Notable too is that the expectation of the imminent Second Coming has been delayed: it will still come about, but first the whole world must be gathered in. In Paul and the first three gospels, and also in Revelation, Jesus is portrayed as having the highest status, but the Jewish commitment to monotheism prevents the authors from depicting him as fully one with God. This stage was reached first in the Christian community which produced the Johannine literature: only here in the New Testament does Jesus become God incarnate, the body of the resurrected Jesus bringing Doubting Thomas to exclaim, \\"My Lord and my God!\\" Historicity The miraculous catch of 153 fish by Duccio, 14th century. Jesus is standing on the left, in the fourth resurrection appearance in John's gospel. Textual sources The earliest mention of the resurrection is in the Pauline epistles, which tradition dates from between 50 and 58 AD. Paul shows very little interest in the teachings of Jesus, focusing attention instead on his role as the suffering, dying, resurrected Christ who would return at any moment to gather the elect and judge the world. In his first epistle to the Corinthians Paul passes on a creed that he says he received shortly after his conversion (). Christ, he says, was raised on the third day \\"according to the scriptures: and then appeared to various followers. He lists, in what appears to be in chronological order, a first appearance to Peter, then to \\"the Twelve,\\" then to five hundred at one time, then to James (presumably James the brother of Jesus), then to \\"all the Apostles,\\" and last to Paul himself. Paul does not mention any appearances to women at the tomb, and other New Testament sources do not mention any appearance to a crowd of 500. According to Habermas, this is an indication of the lack of credibility of women, where their testimony has already been removed from the early creed. There is general agreement that the list is pre-Pauline, dated to within 6 months and no later than 3 years after Jesus's death, but less on how much of it belongs to the tradition and how much is from Paul: most scholars feel that Peter and the Twelve are original, but not all believe the same of the appearances to the 500, James, and \\"all the Apostles\\". The next texts that mention the resurrection are the four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. These date from between 70 and 110 AD, and it is almost certain that none of them were written directly by eyewitnesses, although Luke mentions being in direct contact with them. To take a few examples, according to the Synoptic Gospels Jesus's ministry appears to take one year, inferred from the mentions of a sole instance of Jesus's visit to the Jerusalem temple. His ministry was spent primarily in Galilee, and climaxed with a single visit to Jerusalem at which he cleansed the Temple of the money-changers, while in John, Jerusalem was the focus of Jesus' mission, he visited it three times (possibly indicating his mission lasted three years rather than one), and the cleansing of the Temple took place at the beginning rather than the end of the ministry. Mark, written in the period 65-75 CE, originally contained little mention of post- resurrection appearances, although Mark 16:7, in which the young man discovered in the tomb instructs the women to tell \\"the disciples and Peter\\" that Jesus will see them again in Galilee, hints that the author may have known of the tradition. According to Telford, the verb of seeing Jesus, horan, is used in 1 Corinthians as well as Mark, indicating the author of Mark's knowledge of the oral sayings. The authors of Matthew (c.80-90 CE) and Luke/Acts (a two-part work by the same anonymous author, usually dated to around 80‚Äì90 CE) based their lives of Jesus on the Gospel of Mark but diverge after Mark 16:8. Whereas Mark ends with the discovery of the empty tomb, Matthew continues on with two post-resurrection appearances, the first to Mary Magdalene and \\"the other Mary\\" at the tomb, and the second, based on Mark 16:7, to all the disciples on a mountain in Galilee, where Jesus claims authority over heaven and earth and commissions the disciples to preach the gospel to the whole world. Luke does not mention any of the appearances reported by Matthew, and incorporates Jerusalem rather than just Galilee as the sole location. In Luke, Jesus appears to Cleopas and an unnamed disciple on the road to Emmaus, to Peter (reported by the other apostles), and to the eleven remaining disciples at a meeting with others. The appearances reach their climax with the ascension of Jesus before the assembled disciples on a mountain outside Jerusalem. In addition, Acts has appearances to Paul on the road to Damascus, to the martyr Stephen, and to Peter, who hears the voice of Jesus. The Gospel of John was written some time after 80 or 90 CE, and differs significantly from both Matthew and Luke. Here Jesus appears at the empty tomb to Mary Magdalene (who initially fails to recognise him), then to the disciples minus Thomas, then to all the disciples including Thomas (the \\"doubting Thomas\\" episode), finishing with an extended appearance in Galilee to Peter and six (not all) of the disciples. Chapter 21, the appearance in Galilee, is widely believed to be a later addition to the original gospel. Later sources, such as the Gnostic gospels, which were rejected as heresy, with large embellishments can be contrasted with the canonical Gospels and help to separate later embellishment and invention. The empty tomb 5 part resurrection icon, Solovetsky Monastery, 17th century There are various arguments against the historicity of the resurrection story. For example, the number of other historical figures and gods with similar death and resurrection accounts has been pointed out.Robert M. Price, \\"The Empty Tomb: Introduction; The Second Life of Jesus.\\" In However the majority consensus among biblical scholars is that the genre of the Gospels is a kind of ancient biography.Burridge, R. A. (2006). Gospels. In J. W. Rogerson & Judith M. Lieu (Eds) The Oxford Handbook of Biblical Studies. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 437 Christ-myth theorist Robert M. Price claims that if the resurrection could, in fact, be proven through science or historical evidence, the event would lose its miraculous qualities. New Testament historian Bart D. Ehrman recognizes that \\"Some scholars have argued that it's more plausible that in fact Jesus was placed in a common burial plot, which sometimes happened, or was, as many other crucified people, simply left to be eaten by scavenging animals.\\" He further elaborates by saying: \\"[T]he accounts are fairly unanimous in saying (the earliest accounts we have are unanimous in saying) that Jesus was in fact buried by this fellow, Joseph of Arimathea, and so it's relatively reliable that that's what happened.\\"Bart Ehrman, From Jesus to Constantine: A History of Early Christianity, Lecture 4: \\"Oral and Written Traditions about Jesus\\" [The Teaching Company, 2003]. He later changed his mind, stating that part of the crucifixion punishment was being \\"left to decompose and serve as food for scavenging animals\\", i.e. left without decent burial, since everyone wanted having a decent burial in the Antiquity. G√©za Vermes presents six valid possibilities to explain the empty tomb narrative: (1) The body was removed by someone unconnected with Jesus; (2) The body was stolen by the disciples; (3) The empty tomb (the tomb visited by the women) was not the tomb of Jesus; (4) Buried alive, Jesus later left the tomb; (5) Jesus recovered from a coma and departed Judea; (6) There was a spiritual, not bodily, resurrection. Vermes states that none of these six possibilities is likely to be historical. The quoted material appeared in small caps in Vermes's book. According to N. T. Wright in his book The Resurrection of the Son of God, \\"There can be no question: Paul is a firm believer in bodily resurrection. He stands with his fellow Jews against the massed ranks of pagans; with his fellow Pharisees against other Jews.\\"Wright, The Resurrection of the Son of God, 272; cf. 321 According to Gary Habermas, \\"Many other scholars have spoken in support of a bodily notion of Jesus‚Äô resurrection.\\"Resurrection Research from 1975 to the Present: What are Critical Scholars Saying? Link Habermas also points out three facts in support of Paul's belief in a physical resurrection body. (1) Paul is a Pharisee and therefore (unlike the Sadducees) believes in a physical resurrection. (2) In Philippians 3:11 Paul says \\"That I may attain to the ek anastasis (out- resurrection)\\" from the dead, which according to Habermas means that \\"What goes down is what comes up\\". And (3) In Philippians 3:20-21 \\"We look from heaven for Jesus who will change our vile soma (body) to be like unto his soma (body)\\". According to Habermas, if Paul meant that we would change into a spiritual body then Paul would have used the Greek pneuma instead of soma.From a debate with Anthony Flew on the resurrection of the Jesus. Transcript According to a rough estimate by scholar Gary Habermas, 75% of New Testament scholars are in favor of an empty tomb, while 25% reject an empty tomb.Resurrection Research from 1975 to the Present: \\"Of these scholars, approximately 75% favor one or more of these arguments for the empty tomb, while approximately 25% think that one or more arguments oppose it. Thus, while far from being unanimously held by critical scholars, it may surprise some that those who embrace the empty tomb as a historical fact still comprise a fairly strong majority.\\"  Post-resurrection appearances  New Testament scholar and theologian E. P. Sanders argues that a concerted plot to foster belief in the resurrection would probably have resulted in a more consistent story, and that some of those who were involved in the events gave their lives for their belief. Sanders offers his own hypothesis, saying \\"there seems to have been a competition: 'I saw him,' 'so did I,' 'the women saw him first,' 'no, I did; they didn't see him at all,' and so on.\\"\\"Jesus Christ.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2007. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 10 Jan. 2007 \\"That Jesus' followers (and later Paul) had resurrection experiences is, in my judgment, a fact. What the reality was that gave rise to the experiences I do not know.\\"Sanders, E. P. The Historical Figure of Jesus. New York: Penguin Books, 1993. James Dunn notes that whereas the apostle Paul's resurrection experience was \\"visionary in character\\" and \\"non-physical, non-material,\\" the accounts in the Gospels are very different. He contends that the \\"massive realism'...of the [Gospel] appearances themselves can only be described as visionary with great difficulty - and Luke would certainly reject the description as inappropriate,\\" and that the earliest conception of resurrection in the Jerusalem Christian community was physical.James D.G. Dunn, Jesus and the Spirit: A Study of the Religious and Charismatic Experience of Jesus and the First Christians as Reflected in the New Testament. Eerdmans, 1997. p. 115, 117. Similarly, Helmut Koester writes that the stories of the resurrection were originally epiphanies in which the disciples are called to a ministry by the risen Jesus and were interpreted as physical proof of the event at a secondary stage. He contends that the more detailed accounts of the resurrection are also secondary and do not come from historically trustworthy sources, but instead belong to the genre of the narrative types.Helmut Koester, Introduction to the New Testament, Vol. 2: History and Literature of Early Christianity. Walter de Gruyter, 2000. p. 64-65. N. T. Wright argues that the account of the empty tomb and the visionary experiences point towards the historical reality of the resurrection. He suggests that multiple lines of evidence from the New Testament and the early Christian beliefs it reflects shows that it would be highly unlikely that belief in the empty tomb would simply appear without a clear basis in the memory of early Christians. In tandem with the historically-certain visionary experiences of the early disciples and apostles, Jesus' resurrection as a historical reality becomes far more plausible. Contrary to various theologians and historians in recent decades, Wright treats the resurrection as a historical and accessible event, rather than as a 'supernatural' or 'metaphysical' event.

Football career Marshall was born in the village of Withnell, approximately midway between Chorley, Blackburn and Darwen. After playing junior football in Lancashire, he joined Darwen in 1878. Described as \\"a speedy winger with an accurate passing ability\\", he was selected for the second international match against Wales, played at Wrexham's Racecourse Ground on 15 March 1880. The match ended in a 3‚Äì2 victory for the English, with two goals from Francis Sparks and the other from Marshall's Darwen teammate, Thomas Brindle (although some sources credit this as an own goal by the Welsh goalkeeper, Harry Hibbott). Marshall retained his place for the next international, a return against Wales, played at Alexandra Meadows, Blackburn on 26 February 1881, where he lined up alongside another Darwen player, Thurston Rostron. With a \\"lucky\\" goal from Jack Vaughan, Wales secured their first victory over England at the third attempt. Marshall remained at Darwen until 1886, before retiring after a very short spell with Blackburn Olympic, where he was re-united with his former Darwen and England colleague, Thomas Brindle. Career outside football By trade, Marshall worked in a cotton mill. In the 1881 census, Marshall was listed as a cotton loomer, living in Duckworth Street, Darwen. He died on 29 April 1917, aged 58.

Hilker (April 13, 1881 - March 4, 1949) was an American politician. He served six years in the Wisconsin State Senate and ten years in the Wisconsin State Assembly. Biography Hilker was born April 13, 1881, in Racine, Wisconsin, to Adolph and Carline Hilker. His father was a pioneer brick manufacturer in Racine. In 1898, at age 17, he volunteered for service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and was enlisted as a Private in Company M, 1st Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The war ended before his regiment saw any combat and he mustered out the same year. He married Anne Deschler on November 11, 1899, and together they had one daughter, Grace. Hilker worked in the candy wholesale business, as a coal broker, and in sales promotion. He was a member of the United Spanish War Veterans, the Fraternal Order of Eagles, and the Knights of Pythias. Political career In 1916, Hilker was elected Alderman for the 8th ward on the Racine City Council. He was re-elected six times, and served on the City Council until 1930. In 1924, Hilker was elected to the Wisconsin Assembly for the Racine 2nd District. He was re-elected in 1926, 1928, and 1930. He ran for re-election again in 1932, but was defeated by former assemblyman, Democrat Joseph C. Hamata. Hilker remained active in politics and was a delegate to the 1936 Republican National Convention. In 1940, he reclaimed his former Assembly seat, defeating incumbent Wisconsin Progressive assemblyman Jack Harvey. In 1942, he was elected to the Wisconsin Senate in the 21st District, representing all of Racine County. He was a delegate, again, to the 1944 Republican National Convention. He was re-elected to the senate in 1946, but died before the end of his second term. Death For years before his death, Hilker struggled with a diabetic condition. In early 1949, he was hospitalized at the Wisconsin General Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. He deteriorated over several weeks until his death on March 4, 1949, with his wife and daughter were by his bedside. His funeral was held at the Holy Communion Lutheran Church in Racine.

There is no inscription tablet at the mosque, but it has been dated to the early sixteenth century in the light of its close links with dated monuments of similar style. An inscription from the time of Alauddin Hussain Shah, dated at 910 A. H./1504 A. D. was discovered in the village Champatali, a few miles away from the place. It records the construction of a mosque, and if this inscription describes the mosque at Sura, the year 1504 A. D. is the date of its construction.  Description  The mosque stands on a raised mound of earth and is approached from the east by a flight of steps. It has a single dome over one large square room, and a verandah that has three domes. It has a 4.87 m square prayer chamber flanked on the east by a 1.82 m wide foreroom and measures externally 8.53 m by 12.50 m. At one time it was surrounded by high walls, which is a style otherwise unknown in Bengal. The kiblah wall contains three semicircular mihrab niches with cusped arches, each set within an ornamented rectangular frame. The central mihrab is the largest of the three, and is of stone. The brick walls are faced with stone slab from within and the outside surfaces have some evidence of rich carving work of terracotta.

Raised to Swedish peerage as friherre Jacob Spens. Early life He was the son of David Spens of Wormiston (alternatively spelled Wormieston and Wormeston), by his wife Margaret Learmonth, daughter of Sir Patrik Learmonth of Dairsie. His father formed one of the party which captured the regent Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox at Stirling in 1571, and was shot while trying to guard him from injury. Because of his treason, his estates were forfeited. In 1594 the son James was provost of Crail in Fife, and during the rising of Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell he was called on to find security for the borough. The Lewis expedition In 1598 Spens and other Scottish gentlemen, including his stepfather, Sir James Anstruther of that ilk, entered into a project for a plantation on the Isle of Lewis. With a grant from James VI of Scotland, they landed at Stornoway harbour in October 1599. At first all went well. They took peaceful possession of the country, and the inhabitants, mostly of Clan MacLeod, submitted to them. But they were resisted in the longer term by Neil MacLeod, and Spens was taken hostage by him. The attack on Lewis was renewed by others in 1605, but the undertaking again proved too much for private adventurers. Ambassador, Spy-master and Soldier On being released by MacLeod, Spens entered the service of Charles IX of Sweden, and raised several thousand foot and horse for Sweden, thereby earning the rank of colonel, though he never joined his troops in the field. In July 1609 the Earl of Worcester heard that King James preferred to employ Spens rather than his step-brother, Robert Anstruther, to convey troops from Ireland to service in Sweden.Edmund Lodge, Illustrations of British History, vol. 3 (London, 1838), p. 263. When tension erupted with Denmark in 1611, Spens was recalled by James VI & I, who wished to promote peace between Sweden and Denmark, and was unwilling to allow troops for the Swedish service to be recruited from Scotland ‚Äì at least officially. In the beginning of 1612 James sent Sir James, now a knight, to Sweden, as ambassador on the accession of Gustavus Adolphus, to urge on him the expediency of peace with Denmark. The Treaty of Kn√§red ended the Kalmar War, and, with his step brother Robert Anstruther, Spens contributed to its negotiation. In 1614, and often subsequently, Spens conveyed a request to the London court on behalf of Gustavus Adolphus, in whose interests he worked consistently. On this occasion it concerned Samuel Cockburn and the Swedish wish to have him recruit Scottish troops. In 1615 Spens gained a pension in Scotland (surrendered in 1619), but continued in his duties as dual-ambassador, visiting London and Stockholm several times. He also used his time establishing an effective spy network for the Swedish Chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna. This he deployed mainly against Poland, and particularly against Scots working in the interest of the deposed Swedish king, Sigismund III Vasa. In 1623 Spens was again in Sweden, and was sent by Gustavus to the Scottish privy council to request permission to levy troops in Scotland to repel a threatened Polish invasion. On 24 March 1624 the council authorised his son, James Spens, to levy a body of twelve hundred men to aid the king of Sweden. In the same year Spens was commissioned to return to Sweden and to bring Gustavus into the alliance against Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor which was projected by Great Britain, the Dutch Republic and France. He reached Stockholm in August and returned in January 1625 accompanied by Christian von Bellin, bearing Gustavus's demands. These were thought extravagant, and the more moderate proposals of Christian IV of Denmark having been accepted, Spens was despatched in March to persuade Gustavus to enter the confederacy as the ally of Denmark. Unsuccessful he returned to his role as military commander and embedded diplomat. His main regiment of Scots was based in Riga in Livonia from late 1624 onwards, while Spens continued with his shuttle diplomacy when required. In 1627 Spens was dispatched to invest Gustavus, then occupied in the Polish‚ÄìSwedish War (1626‚Äì1629), with the Order of the Garter. That he did in Dirschau; and moved on to Elbing, where he recruited John Durie as his secretary. On 28 April 1628 Gustavus made him friherre Spens awarding him the barony of Orreholmen.Swedish House of Nobility; In March 1629 Spens was commissioned by Gustavus to urge Charles I of England to support him in the Thirty Years' War. For the next year he was charged with the superintendence of Gustavus's levies in Scotland and England, and letters by him are extant on this subject. He moved with his regiment into Germany in 1630 and followed the main Swedish army in the company of Gustavus Adolphus. Family He married Agnes Durie, by whom he had three sons (James and David and William), and daughters Cecilia, Isabella and one daughter whose name is unknown. His second wife was Margaret Forratt (Margaretha Forath) with whom he had sons Axel and Jacob. After his death Margaret married Hugh Hamilton, 1st Viscount of Glenawly. Isobel Spens married James Ramsay, another Scot, who rose to high military rank in Swedish service and was much employed by Spens as an intermediary with Axel Oxenstierna.

According to the last census from 2002, the total number of Bosniaks in Slovenia was 32,009 as they comprised 1.6% of the total population of Slovenia. According to the last census, they are the third largest minority ethnic group in Slovenia, after Serbs and Croats. Geography Bosniaks in Slovenia primarily live in the capital city of Slovenia; Ljubljana. There are dispersed populations of Bosniaks living in various cities and towns in Slovenia, though most choose to live in Ljubljana. Many Bosniaks have left Slovenia for other Western countries and Bosnia. Bosniaks make up a tiny percentage of Slovenia's population, however today, many Bosniaks have retained their identity and culture. History The first Bosniak mosque in Slovenia was built in 1916 in Log pod Mangartom on the slopes of the Alps. During the First World War, a Bosniak regiment made up primarily of Bosnian Muslims were sent to fight on the Italian front. One of the soldiers who fought there was a boy called Elez Dervi≈°eviƒá, the youngest soldier to fight in the Soca battle in World War I. Elez was 11 years old when he served in the Austro-Hungarian Army. In Log pod Mangartom there is a statue of Elez's father dedicated to him. Many Bosniaks have emigrated to Slovenia from their native Bosnia since the 1960s, primarily due to economic factors and chances for better employment. At the time, it was noted that most of the general Slovenian population looked down on their neighbors from other Yugoslav republics, but among others, Bosniaks and Serbs were the most disliked and unwelcomed. This mindset would continue well after the break-up of Yugoslavia, as Slovenia was the only member-country of the EU to oppose Croatia's EU bid, despite of the fact that Croats and Slovenes have historically shared the most cultural and traditional values than any other southern Slavic nations (such as the fact that they were the only predominant Catholic nations in the former Yugoslavia). Slovenians grouped Bosniaks with Serbians, Croatians and Macedonians. These groups were often called ju≈ænjaki (southerners), ta spodni (those from down there), ƒçefurj and ≈†vedi (Swedes), all had negative connotations. Religion Today, the majority of Bosniaks are predominantly Sunni Muslim and adhere to the Hanafi school of thought, or law, the largest and oldest school of Islamic law in jurisprudence within Sunni Islam.

It is Didi family that bears Joka-Saramba, Jok-Abuodha and Jok-Awiti. I History The history of this village dates back to several centuries if not back to the first millennium when the Luo people migrated south and east along the shores of Lake Victoria into what is now Tanzania. The name \\"Kowak\\" for this village comes from an ancestor named Owak, who first homesteaded there. In Luo, someone's homestead is identified by his name or her name. For example, Onyango's homestead is called Konyango, Achola's is Kachola, Chiemo's is Kachiemo and Raila's is Karaila. That is why Owak's homestead is now known as Kowak. Owak had five wives namely Nyagak, Nyaguti, Chipa and Mot. With Chipa he conceived Kibira and Otho. With Nyaguti, he conceived three sons; Maugo, Okecha and Chwonyo. With Nyagak he conceived Ondiek, Achuth and Otenga. With Mot he conceived Ade and Ogunda. Chiemo was adapted son who lived in Owak homestead and Owak gave him the status of younger brother. Now, the Kowak village is generally considered to be occupied by the descendants of Kibira, who was the firstborn, and thus inherited his father's homestead. The village of Nyasoko was made by Otho's descendants, and Omuga was made by Chiemo's descendants. Also, Det village was made by Mot and her sons; Somba Nyasoko was made by Nyaguti and Nyagak and their sons. Kowak people are only pure Luo blooded in Tanzania compared to others who had married to other tribes like Kurya and others.

Together with the hybrid with S. rosea, Schlumbergera √ó graeseri, it is known as Easter cactus or Whitsun cactus and is a widely cultivated ornamental plant. It has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Description Schlumbergera gaertneri is found in southeastern Brazil, in Paran√° and Santa Catarina, at altitudes of . As with other species of the genus, S. gaertneri grows on trees (epiphytic) or less often rocks (lithophytic) in sub-tropical rain forest. With maturity, it develops into a branching pendant leafless shrub with a woody base. The stems are made up of segments, most of which are flattened and which are the photosynthetic organs (cladodes) of the plant. Younger segments are dullish green, long and wide, with small notches on the margins. Structures characteristic of cacti, called areoles, form in these notches. Flowers form from areoles at the ends of the stems. These are scarlet in colour, long, radially symmetrical (actinomorphic), opening to a funnel shape with a maximum diameter of about . Red oblong fruits form after the flowers are fertilized. Taxonomy Although cacti belonging to the tribe Rhipsalideae are quite distinct in appearance and habit from other cacti, as they grow on trees or rocks as epiphytes or lithophytes, for a long time there has been confusion as to how the species should be placed into genera. Schlumbergera gaertneri was first described in 1884 by Eduard von Regel as the variety gaertneri of Epiphyllum russellianum (now Schlumbergera russelliana). The name honours Joseph Gaertner. In 1889, William Watson elevated it to the full species E. gaertneri and in 1913, Nathaniel Britton and Josephy Rose transferred it to Schlumbergera as S. gaertneri. The relationship to S. russelliana was based on the appearance of the stems, made up of somewhat flattened segments with small teeth, and the radially symmetrical shape of the flowers. However, the deeper structure of the flower differs from other Schlumbergera species, which have a short floral tube at the base of the flower formed by fused petals, and stamens arranged in two distinct series, whereas S. gaertneri has separate petals and a single series of stamens. S. gaertneri was separated from Schlumbergera as Rhipsalis gaertneri by Friedrich Vaupel in 1925, after which it was successively transferred to Epiphyllopsis by Alwin Berger in 1929, Rhipsalidopsis by Reid Moran in 1953, and Hatiora by Wilhelm Barthlott in 1987. More recently, it has been restored to Schlumbergera as the result of molecular phylogenetic studies. In horticultural sources, the Easter cactus continued to be referred to as Schlumbergera gaertneri (even when other sources placed it in Hatiora), and also as Rhipsalidopsis gaertneri. Cultivation Flower of Schlumbergera √ó graeseri cultivar Flower of Schlumbergera √ó graeseri cultivar Under the name Easter cactus or Whitsun cactus, Schlumbergera gaertneri is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant for its scarlet flowers. Its common names reflect the period in which it flowers in the Northern Hemisphere, namely late Spring. It has been artificially crossed with a pink-flowered species, Schlumbergera rosea, to form the hybrid S. √ó graeseri, cultivars of which have flowers in a wider range of colours. The Easter cactus is considered more difficult to grow than the Christmas or Thanksgiving cactus (other cultivars and hybrids of Schlumbergera). Recommendations for care include: * Temperature Summer temperatures around are suggested, with lower temperatures down to in the winter (November to January in the Northern Hemisphere) to initiate good bud formation. * Light As epiphytic forest plants, they are not exposed to strong sunlight. Half-shade is recommended; plants can be placed outside in the summer., p. 74 * Watering The Easter cactus is said to respond badly to over- or under-watering, e.g. by losing stem segments; continuously moist soil is recommended. * Propagation Stem segments may be removed in late Spring and the cut surface allowed to dry out before being placed in slightly moist soil.

Mukundan. It was first published as a book by D. C. Books in November 2011. The novel portrays the various events that greatly influenced the author's life during the 40 years spent in New Delhi, since 1962. The novel has as protagonist a leftist Kerala youth, named Sahadevan, who had the shock of his life when he landed in Delhi to hear the news of Chinese attack on India.\\"My works never encouraged drug use, says top author\\". Gulf Times. 19 November 2011. Retrieved 7 December 2011. It took three years for Mukundan to finish the novel. It was released on 1 November 2011.\\"Finished work belongs to readers: Mukundan\\". The Hindu. 2 November 2011. Retrieved 7 December 2011. The novel received much critical praise and soon went on to become one of the best-selling novels of the year. It also won several awards including the first Kamala Suraiyya Award. Background Delhi Gadhakal has been penned in the backdrop of New Delhi, the city to which the author's name has been associated probably even more than his hometown, Mayyazhi (Mahe). The novel was inspired by various events that greatly influenced the author's life during the 40 years spent in New Delhi, since 1962. Mukundan had traveled to Delhi in 1962, as a young man, in search of a job, and over the next four decades, while working in the French Embassy, he has observed how the city has been transformed from a small village to a megapolis. The novel begins with the Sino-Indian War. Mukundan says, \\"That war was a historical jolt for the Left movement in India. The Left was counting so much on China and its Premier, Zhou Enlai. In fact, in the Kerala of those days, we talked more about Zhou, rather than Mahatma Gandhi and Pandit Nehru.\\" In the novel, Mukundan also describes the impact of the 1965 and 1971 wars against Pakistan on the people of Delhi. But the most important section is on the 1975 Emergency which was imposed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The novel also describes in detail the assassination of Indira Gandhi in 1984 and the subsequent anti-Sikh riots. Plot summary The novel narrates a story set in Delhi through the eyes of a Malayali youth, named Sahadevan, who lands in the capital after securing a job in a travel agency. On his arrival in the capital, carrying high hopes and aspirations, Sahadevan is welcomed by a shocker when he learns that China had attacked India. It was a historical jolt for the Left movement. This along with his first sight of old Delhi, which in those days looked like an ordinary village with plenty of wheat and cauliflower fields forms the first chapters of the novel. In the following chapters, several historical incidents such as Indo-Pak Wars of 1965 and 1971, The 1975 Emergency, assassination of Indira Gandhi and the subsequent anti- Sikh riots, and their impact on the people of Delhi have been tellingly narrated. The novel ends with a dream sequence in which a dying Sahadevan sees hundred thousands of beggars storm the Parliament.

The novelist has been highly successful with his earlier novel Delhi which had rewritten the conventional nuances of Malayalam novels by deviating from the then existing genre. Later, he had also penned a short-story on Delhi titled \\"Delhi1981\\". But the writer says that his latest work in no way should be treated a sequel to the earlier Delhi. According to the author, this novel is different from his other novels both thematically and in the style of narration. It took three years for Mukundan to finish the novel. He says that the idea of painting Delhi in such a huge canvas has always been in his mind, and he spent most of the time back in Delhi to pen the novel after completing his five-year term as the office- bearer of the Kerala Sahithya Akademi. Release The novel was released by former Kerala education minister M. A. Baby on 1 November 2011, at a cultural festival organised in connection with the 13th DC International Book Fair. In the event, Baby lauded the writer for his efforts to explore and recreate the mindset of the people during the Emergency and ‚Äòtheir view of Indira Gandhi's misjudgement about people's power.'

The student has to answer the question in such a way as to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the subject to pass the exam. The oral exam also helps reduce (although it does not eliminate) the risk of granting a degree to a candidate who has had the thesis or dissertation ghostwritten by an expert. Overview Many science programs require students pursuing a bachelor's degree to finish the program by taking an oral exam or a combination of oral and written exams to show how well a student has understood the material studied in the program. Usually, study guides or a syllabus are made available so that the students may prepare for the exam by reviewing practice questions and topics likely to be on the exam. There is a small but growing body of literature on the use of oral examinations in undergraduate education in the English speaking world. Some medical schools use oral exams for second and third year students to test knowledge but also the ability to respond on the spot. Students are required to take an oral exam prior to being awarded a PhD. Some universities allow the option of either taking written and oral exams or completing a project or thesis, but occasionally, all three are required for graduation. Oral exams are distinct from a defense of a thesis in that the questions in the latter are more narrow and specific to the topic of the thesis. Graduate students are sometimes allowed to choose their examiners for oral exams. Sometimes, the oral exam is offered in schools as an alternative to a written exam for students with a learning disability, like dysgraphia, developmental coordination disorder, or non-verbal learning disorder. Often parents of the students have to request that the oral exam be given to their child in lieu of the written exam. A Private Pilot Oral Exam is also required as part of the FAA and CAA practical test for prospective pilots.Private Pilot Oral Exam on YouTube An oral exam is also carried out by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency in the UK for the purpose of issuing certificate of competencies for Merchant Navy deck and engine officers.Application for UK COC Oral Exam The viva voce is a component of music diploma examinations administered by ABRSM, Trinity College of Music and London College of Music.

History The Eastern Health Alliance was officially launched on 18 November 2011 by founding members Changi General Hospital, St. Andrew's Community Hospital, SingHealth Polyclinics and The Salvation Army Peacehaven Nursing Home. This was in line with the national direction to make healthcare ongoing rather than episodic, especially for people with chronic conditions like diabetes, stroke, cancer, and lung and heart diseases. Guided by its vision, \\"Towards seamless quality care ‚Äì together\\", it sought to gradually reshape Singapore's model of healthcare to meet the challenges of a growing and ageing population. In Jan 2018, the Eastern Health Alliance merged with SingHealth as part of a public health restructuring exercise. Integrated care programmes The Eastern Health Alliance was focused on delivering a range of healthcare services, from early detection, disease prevention and management, through to ongoing care. It developed a range of integrated care programmes for the people of eastern Singapore. Eastern Community Health Outreach A community-based chronic disease prevention programme offered in partnership with grassroots organisations. The programme included health screenings, health coaching and healthy lifestyle activities, which aim to intervene early to delay the onset of chronic diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol. Health Management Unit Set up to assist patients who need help to manage their long-term conditions. These patients received advice from nurse tele- carers on medication, diet and lifestyle, how to monitor their condition and look out for signs of deterioration, helping them stay healthy for as long as possible. Those who needed more help would receive further guidance and support in between medical visits. Community Health Centre It supported general practitioners by providing services for patients with long-term conditions. Services included eye screening, foot screening, health monitoring and education about diet, lifestyle and medication. The first centre, located in Tampines, was helmed by senior nurses and allied health professionals with experience in caring for patients with chronic conditions. Changi General Hospital-St. Andrew‚Äôs Community Hospital partnership The positioning of St. Andrew's Community Hospital (SACH) right next to Changi General Hospital (CGH) enabled a transfer of care for more than 4,000 patients since 2005. Patients who no longer require acute care were transferred to SACH for rehabilitation and continuing medical care. SACH and CGH are connected by a covered link bridge. This close proximity helps facilitate better coordinated and integrated care for SACH patients through the sharing of medical records and clinical support services, and consultations by visiting CGH specialists. Transitional Care Transitional Care helps to bridge the gap between hospital and home for patients with complex or multiple care needs. It aimed to stabilise, rehabilitate, and help patients and their caregivers cope with care at home. It also aimed to reduce unnecessary re-admissions to the hospital. The Transitional Care team comprised doctors, nurses, therapists, dietitians, pharmacists and medical social workers. Grace Corner A facility set up in The Salvation Army Peacehaven Nursing Home to provide rehabilitation services for patients with long-term debilitating conditions, and training for caregivers. Medical and nursing services, as well as lifestyle activities are provided. The aim was for patients to be fit enough to return home and integrate back into the community. Home Care Service St. Andrew's Community Hospital's Home Care Service attended to the nursing needs of patients residing in the east. These patients were discharged from acute care hospitals or community hospitals and usually have medical histories of strokes, fractures and multiple diseases. Common nursing care provided to them included changing their urinary catheters; nasal-gastric tubes for feeding, wound care, dressings, and removal of stitches after a surgery.
