Life  Born in Alton, Illinois, Whittlesey was a draftsman for Louis Sullivan before opening his own Chicago practice. Many of Whittlesey's major commissions show Sullivan's influence. In 1900, at the age of 33, Whittlesey was appointed Chief Architect for the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway. Among many other stations and hotels for the railroad, he designed the El Tovar Hotel, the former Harvey House situated just 20 ft from the south rim of the Grand Canyon in Arizona, United States. It stands at the northern terminus of the Grand Canyon Railway, formerly a branch of the Santa Fe. The hotel is one of only a handful of Harvey House facilities still in operation, and is an example of National Park Service Rustic architecture. The razed Alvarado Hotel in Albuquerque, New Mexico was also his design, with interior work done by Mary Colter. Whittlesey moved to San Francisco in 1907 and worked mainly there and in Los Angeles, becoming known for his early work in reinforced concrete. Whittlesey's son Austin C. Whittlesey (1893‚Äì1950) was also an architect, apprenticed in the office of Bertram Goodhue for seven years, and was active in Southern California in the 1930s. While working as staff designer for Allison & Allison he designed the 1930 Southern California Edison Building, across the street from Goodhue's L.A. Public Library.

Imjin war Qian was promoted to a low ranking general as a result of the Imjin War, and after he arrived at Beijing on his latest logistical run along the Grand Canal he quickly took 1,000 men to Liaodong. Upon arriving at Liaodong, he learned of his mother's death back home, but choose to hide the information from others so he could continue to participate in the war. Qian along with Wu Weizhong was part of the vanguard of the major Ming expedition in 1593 directed by Song Yingchang and led by Li Rusong. According to Qian's records, on 1/1 1593 he encountered a small scouting party of Japanese and killed its leader in the ensuing skirmish. In the following days, he was part of the forces that retook PyongYang from the Japanese forces under Konishi Yukinaga. Qian's records complained that although Li Rusong commanded the Ming army to not take any heads during the battle, he realized after the battle that Li's own men and the Northern troops closer to him had basically ignored the order. Qian noted that by then the Korean logistics were already lagging behind the Ming forces, and only until nearly a week later did the grain shipments finally arrive in sufficient number for the Ming forces to continue forward. Qian was part of the forces that retook Kaesong on the 19th. During this time he met a small group of Japanese forces, whose opposing commander challenged him to a duel. Qian accepted the challenge and killed the samurai, but afterwards he was denied of the claim because he did not know the name of his foe. His records also stated that the general Zha Dashou (Êü•Â§ßÂèó) was responsible for misleading Li Rusong and the Ming forces to the debacle in the battle of Byeokjegwan in late January that year. After the battle of Byeokjegwan, the Ming army stalled; disease and grudges between the generals of different origins also contributed to the problem. After peace talks began, Qian was sent to escort the Japanese delegation group. He recorded that they went hunting around Busan (where Qian captured a large feral horse) along with other daily conversations and interactions. Qian returned to China along with the main Ming host in September 1593.The section is a compilation of his work, \\"The records of the eastern expedition\\" , which recorded his actions doing the war. Later life Qian began to rise quickly after returning from Korea, eventually topping out as the Zhongbin (highest level of generals in the Ming) in 1620, but he retired before officially taking office.\\"ÂòâÂÆöÁ∏£Ë™å‰∫∫Áâ©ÂÇ≥ - Èå¢‰∏ñÊ•®\\"‰∫åÂçÅ‰∫åÂπ¥Èò≤ÂÄ≠Êµ∑‰∏äÊïçÂæÅÊù±ÂäüÈôûËñäÈéÆÂèÉÂ∞áÊ≠∑‰ªªÊ±üÂçóÈáëÂ±±Â∏∏ÈïáÂèÉÂ∞áÈôûÊ±üË•øÁ∏ΩÂÖµÊú™‰ªªÂëäÊ≠∏ He was a close friend with the famous Ming politician Xu Guangqi.

The eldest daughter of Rajah Gambang and ruling Pasig together with her husband, Rajah Lontok, legend considers her one of the most powerful rulers in the early history of the Tagalog people, and one of very few female leaders in early Philippine history. Under her reign, the Kingdom of Tondo reached its Golden Age, where it spanned from the southern Cordilleras down to Ibalon (now Bicol). She is also notably the last Buddhist ruler of Tondo, which encompassed land along the banks of the Pasig River in Metro Manila. Life Dayang Kalangitan was the daughter of Rajah Gambang, who was then sovereign of Tondo. Since her father died without leaving a male heir, she was appointed queen regnant. Kalangitan married to Gat Lontok, (later Rajah Lontok) of Tondo. Believing herself capable of ruling, she proved to be a strong ruler. Together with her husband, Kalangitan established a small kingdom upstream to the east of Tondo around the Bitukang Man√≥k (today Parian Creek in Pasig City). Sometime around 1450, she became sole ruler of both Tondo, which included Bitukang Man√≥k, the place she had established with her husband. Around 1470, Namayan became a vassal to the Kingdom of Tondo. In order to maintain power and influence as queen in the area, Kalangitan assented to the marriage of one of her daughters, Dayang Panginoan, to Prince Balagtas, the son of Empress Sasaban of Namayan. Under her reign, the Kingdom of Tondo reached its Golden Age, where it spanned from the southern Cordilleras down to Ibalon (now Bicol), the greatest extent of the kingdom's historical territories. However, at around 1500, the Sultanate of Brunei made an attack on the Kingdom of Tondo and established the Kingdom of Maynila and put Kalangitan's son, Salalila as the monarch of Tondo, Maynila, and Namayan. Dayang Kalangitan's son Salalila succeeded her as monarch; after converting to Islam, he adopted his more famous name, Sulaiman. Tondo and Maynila became separate kingdoms after Salalila. Tondo was ruled by Salalila's eldest son, Lakan Dula and Maynila by Rajah Matanda and Rajah Sulayman. Namayan came under the rule of Rajah Kalamayin.

The plot revolves around a princess named Kalangitan, who became the Queen regnant of Namayan, Tondo, and on her realm at Bitukang Manok, which is the seat of power.

Robin Sage is a fictional American cyber threat analyst. She was created in December 2009 by Robin Casey and Thomas Ryan, two controversial security specialists and white hat hackers from New York City. Her name was taken from a training exercise of United States Army Special Forces. Fictional biography According to Sage's social networking profiles, she is a 25-year-old \\"cyber threat analyst\\" at the Naval Network Warfare Command in Norfolk, Virginia. She graduated from MIT and had allegedly 10 years of work experience, despite her young age. Ryan created several accounts under the name Sage on popular social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter etc. and used those profiles to contact nearly 300 people, most of them security specialists, military personnel, staff at intelligence agencies and defense contractors. Her pictures were taken from a pornography- related website in order to attract more attention. Despite the fake profile and no other real-life information, Sage was offered consulting work with notable companies Google and Lockheed Martin. She also received dinner invitations from several male contacts. Not everyone was fooled by Sage's profiles, and Ryan admitted that his cover was already blown on the second day, when several of those Sage tried to befriend attempted to verify her identity using the phone number he provided, checking email addresses outside the social networking sites or using the MIT alumni network to find her. Others recognized the fake identity of Sage based on her implausible profiles. Yet no central warning was issued about the profile, and users continued to connect with Sage despite warnings not to do so. Security problems revealed Using those contacts, Ryan befriended men and women of all ages during a short time period between December 2009 and January 2010. Almost all of them were working for the United States military, government or companies (amongst the only organizations that did not befriend Sage were the CIA and the FBI). Using these contacts, Ryan gained access to email addresses and bank accounts as well as learning the location of secret military units based on soldiers' Facebook photos and connections between different people and organizations. She was also given private documents for review and was offered to speak at several conferences. \\"Getting in bed with Robin Sage\\" Ryan presented his findings as a speaker at the \\"Black Hat\\" conference in Las Vegas with a presentation he called \\"Getting in bed with Robin Sage\\". He explained that his short experiment proves that seemingly harmless details shared via social networking pages can be harmful but also that many people entrusted with vital and sensitive information would share this information readily with third parties, provided they managed to capture their interest. He concluded that his findings could have compromised national security if a terrorist organization had employed similar tactics.

The territorial claims for the Greater Germanic Reich fluctuated over time. As early as the autumn of 1933, Hitler envisioned annexing such territories as Bohemia, Western Poland and Austria to Germany and creation of satellite or puppet states without economies or policies of their own.. This pan-Germanic Empire was expected to assimilate practically all of Germanic Europe into an enormously expanded Reich. Territorially speaking, this encompassed the already-enlarged German Reich itself (consisting of pre-1938 Germany proper, Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, Alsace- Lorraine, Eupen-Malmedy, Memel, Lower Styria, Upper Carniola, Southern Carinthia and German-occupied Poland), the Netherlands, the Flemish part of Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, at least the German- speaking parts of Switzerland and Liechtenstein.Rich 1974, pp. 401‚Äì402. The most notable exception was the United Kingdom, which was not projected as having to be reduced to a German province but to instead become an allied seafaring partner of the Germans.Strobl 2000, pp. 202‚Äì208. Another exception was German-populated territory in South Tyrol that was part of allied Italy. Aside from Germanic Europe, the Reich's western frontiers with France were to be reverted to those of the earlier Holy Roman Empire, which would have meant the complete annexation of all of Wallonia, French Switzerland and large areas of northern and eastern France.Williams 2005, p. 209. Additionally, the policy of Lebensraum planned mass expansion of Germany eastwards to the Ural Mountains.Andr√© Mineau. Operation Barbarossa: Ideology and Ethics Against Human Dignity. Rodopi, 2004. p. 36.Rolf Dieter M√ºller, Gerd R. Uebersch√§r. Hitler's War in the East, 1941-1945: A Critical Assessment. Berghahn Books, 2009. p. 89. Hitler planned for the \\"surplus\\" Russian population living west of the Urals to be deported to the east of the Urals.Bradl Lightbody. The Second World War: Ambitions to Nemesis. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2004. p. 97. Ideological background =Racial theories= Nazi racial ideology regarded the Germanic peoples of Europe as belonging to a racially superior Nordic subset of the larger Aryan race, who were regarded as the only true culture-bearers of civilized society.Bohn 1997, p. 7. These peoples were viewed as either \\"true Germanic peoples\\" that had \\"lost their sense of racial pride\\", or as close racial relatives of the Germans.Wright 1968, p. 115. German Chancellor Adolf Hitler also believed that the Ancient Greeks and Romans were the racial ancestors of the Germans, and the first torchbearers of \\"NordicGreek\\" art and culture.Hitler 2000, p. 225.Housden 2000, p. 163. He particularly expressed his admiration for Ancient Sparta, declaring it to have been the purest racial state:Grafton et al 2010, p. 363. Furthermore, Hitler's concept of \\"Germanic\\" did not simply refer to an ethnic, cultural, or linguistic group, but also to a distinctly biological one, the superior \\"Germanic blood\\" that he wanted to salvage from the control of the enemies of the Aryan race. He stated that Germany possessed more of these \\"Germanic elements\\" than any other country in the world, which he estimated as \\"four fifths of our people\\".Hitler 2000, p. 307. According to the Nazis, in addition to the Germanic peoples, individuals of seemingly non- Germanic nationality such as French, Polish, Walloon, Czech and so on might actually possess valuable Germanic blood, especially if they were of aristocratic or peasant stock. In order to \\"recover\\" these \\"missing\\" Germanic elements, they had to be made conscious of their Germanic ancestry through the process of Germanization (the term used by the Nazis for this process was Umvolkung, \\"restoration to the race\\"). If the \\"recovery\\" was impossible, these individuals had to be destroyed to deny the enemy of using their superior blood against the Aryan race. An example of this type of Nazi Germanization is the kidnapping of \\"racially valuable\\" Eastern European children. Curiously, those chosen for Germanization who rejected the Nazis were viewed as being racially more suitable than those who went along without objections, as according to Himmler \\"it was in the nature of German blood to resist\\".Robert Cecil, The Myth of the Master Race: Alfred Rosenberg and Nazi Ideology p.199 On the very first page of Mein Kampf, Hitler openly declared his belief that \\"common blood belongs in a common Reich\\", elucidating the notion that the innate quality of race (as the Nazi movement perceived it) should hold precedence over \\"artificial\\" concepts such as national identity (including regional German identities such as Prussian and Bavarian) as the deciding factor for which people were \\"worthy\\" of being assimilated into a Greater German racial state (Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein F√ºhrer).Hitler 1927, p. 1. Part of the strategic methods which Hitler chose to ensure the present and future supremacy of the Aryan race (which was, according to Hitler, \\"gradually approaching extinction\\"Fest 1973, p. 210.) was to do away with what he described as the \\"small state rubbish\\" (Kleinstaatenger√ºmpel, compare Kleinstaaterei) in Europe in order to unite all these Nordic countries into one unified racial community.Fink 1985, pp. 27, 152. From 1921 onward he advocated the creation of a \\"Germanic Reich of the German Nation\\". =Name= The chosen name for the projected empire was a deliberate reference to the Holy Roman Empire (of the German Nation) that existed in medieval times, known as the First Reich in National Socialist historiography.Hattstein 2006, p. 321. Different aspects of the legacy of this medieval empire in German history were both celebrated and derided by the National Socialist government. Hitler admired the Frankish Emperor Charlemagne for his \\"cultural creativity\\", his powers of organization, and his renunciation of the rights of the individual. He criticized the Holy Roman Emperors however for not pursuing an Ostpolitik (Eastern Policy) resembling his own, while being politically focused exclusively on the south. After the Anschluss, Hitler ordered the old imperial regalia (the Imperial Crown, Imperial Sword, the Holy Lance and other items) residing in Vienna to be transferred to Nuremberg, where they were kept between 1424 and 1796. Nuremberg, in addition to being the former unofficial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, was also the place of the Nuremberg rallies. The transfer of the regalia was thus done to both legitimize Hitler's Germany as the successor of the \\"Old Reich\\", but also weaken Vienna, the former imperial residence.Haman 1999, p. 110 After the 1939 German occupation of Bohemia, Hitler declared that the Holy Roman Empire had been \\"resurrected\\", although he secretly maintained his own empire to be better than the old \\"Roman\\" one.Brockmann 2006, p. 179. Unlike the \\"uncomfortably internationalist Catholic empire of Barbarossa\\", the Germanic Reich of the German Nation would be racist and nationalist. Rather than a return to the values of the Middle Ages, its establishment was to be \\"a push forward to a new golden age, in which the best aspects of the past would be combined with modern racist and nationalist thinking\\". The historical borders of the Holy Empire were also used as grounds for territorial revisionism by the NSDAP, laying claim to modern territories and states that were once part of it. Even before the war, Hitler had dreamed of reversing the Peace of Westphalia, which had given the territories of the Empire almost complete sovereignty. On November 17, 1939, Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels wrote in his diary that the \\"total liquidation\\" of this historic treaty was the \\"great goal\\" of the Nazi regime, and that since it had been signed in M√ºnster, it would also be officially repealed in the same city.Goebbels, p. 51. =Pan-Germanism versus Pan-Germanicism= Despite intending to accord the other \\"Germanics\\" of Europe a racially superior status alongside the Germans themselves in an anticipated post-war racio-political order, the Nazis did not however consider granting the subject populations of these countries any national rights of their own. The other Germanic countries were seen as mere extensions of Germany rather than individual units in any way, and the Germans were unequivocally intended to remain the empire's \\"most powerful source of strength, from both an ideological as well as military standpoint\\".Hitler 2000, p. 306. Even Heinrich Himmler, who among the senior Nazis most staunchly supported the concept, could not shake off the idea of a hierarchical distinction between German Volk and Germanic V√∂lker.Wright 1968, pp. 141‚Äì142. The SS's official newspaper, Das Schwarze Korps, never succeeded in reconciling the contradiction between Germanic 'brotherhood' and German superiority. Members of Nazi-type parties in Germanic countries were also forbidden to attend public meetings of the Nazi Party when they visited Germany. After the Battle of Stalingrad this ban was lifted, but only if the attendees made prior notice of their arrival so that the events' speakers could be warned in advance not to make disparaging remarks about their country of origin.Rothwell 2005, p. 31. Although Hitler himself and Himmler's SS advocated for a pan-Germanic Empire, the objective was not universally held in the Nazi regime.Lipgens 1985, p. 41. Goebbels and the Reich Foreign Ministry under Joachim von Ribbentrop inclined more towards an idea of a continental bloc under German rule, as represented by the Anti- Comintern Pact, Ribbentrop's \\"European Confederation\\" project and the earlier Mitteleuropa concept. =Germanic mysticism= There were also disagreements within the NSDAP leadership on the spiritual implications of cultivating a 'Germanic history' in their ideological program. Hitler was highly critical of Himmler's esoteric v√∂lkisch interpretation of the 'Germanic mission'. When Himmler denounced Charlemagne in a speech as \\"the butcher of the Saxons\\", Hitler stated that this was not a 'historical crime' but in fact a good thing, for the subjugation of Widukind had brought Western culture into what eventually became Germany.Speer 1970, pp. 147‚Äì148. He also disapproved of the pseudoarchaeological projects which Himmler organized through his Ahnenerbe organization, such as excavations of pre-historic Germanic sites: \\"Why do we call the whole world's attention to the fact that we have no past? In an attempt to eventually supplant Christianity with a religion more amenable to National Socialist ideology, Himmler, together with Alfred Rosenberg, sought to replace it with Germanic paganism (the indigenous traditional religion or Volksreligion of the Germanic peoples), of which the Japanese Shinto was seen as an almost perfect East Asian counterpart.Domarus 2007, p. 158. For this purpose they had ordered the construction of sites for the worship of Germanic cults in order to exchange Christian rituals for Germanic consecration ceremonies, which included different marriage and burial rites. In Heinrich Heims' Adolf Hitler, Monologe im FHQ 1941-1944 (several editions, here Orbis Verlag, 2000), Hitler is quoted as having said on 14 October 1941: \\"It seems to be inexpressibly stupid to allow a revival of the cult of Odin/Wotan. Our old mythology of the gods was defunct, and incapable of revival, when Christianity came...the whole world of antiquity either followed philosophical systems on the one hand, or worshipped the gods. But in modern times it is undesirable that all humanity should make such a fool of itself.\\" Establishment strategy The goal was first proclaimed publicly in the 1937 Nuremberg Rallies.Speer 1970, pp. 115‚Äì116. Hitler's last speech at this event ended with the words \\"The German nation has after all acquired its Germanic Reich\\", which elicited speculation in political circles of a 'new era' in Germany's foreign policy. Several days before the event Hitler took Albert Speer aside when both were on their way to the former's Munich apartment with an entourage, and declared to him that \\"We will create a great empire. All the Germanic peoples will be included in it. It will begin in Norway and extend to northern Italy.This passage should in all likelihood be interpreted to mean \\"extending up to northern Italy\\", not that it would also include this region. There is no convincing evidence that Hitler intended to include any Italian provinces in the German state before 1943, including South Tyrol.Rich 1974, p. 318. I myself must carry this out. If only I keep my health!\\" On April 9, 1940, as Germany invaded Denmark and Norway in Operation Weser√ºbung, Hitler announced the establishment of the Germanic Reich: \\"Just as the Bismarck Empire arose from the year 1866, so too will the Greater Germanic Empire arise from this day.\\"Sager & Winkler 2007, p. 74. The establishment of the empire was to follow the model of the Austrian Anschluss of 1938, just carried out on a greater scale.Welch 1983, p. 145. Goebbels emphasized in April 1940 that the annexed Germanic countries would have to undergo a similar \\"national revolution\\" as Germany herself did after the Machtergreifung, with an enforced rapid social and political \\"co-ordination\\" in accordance with Nazi principles and ideology (Gleichschaltung). The ultimate goal of the Gleichschaltung policy pursued in these parts of occupied Europe was to destroy the very concepts of individual states and nationalities, just as the concept of a separate Austrian state and national identity was repressed after the Anschluss through the establishment of new state and party districts.Rich 1974, pp. 24‚Äì25, 140. The new empire was to no longer be a nation-state of the type that had emerged in the 19th century, but instead a \\"racially pure community\\". It is for this reason that the German occupiers had no interest in transferring real power to the various far-right nationalist movements present in the occupied countries (such as Nasjonal Samling, the NSB, etc.) except for temporary reasons of Realpolitik, and instead actively supported radical collaborators who favored pan-Germanic unity (i.e. total integration to Germany) over provincial nationalism (for example DeVlag).See e.g. Warmbrunn 1963, pp. 91‚Äì93. Unlike Austria and the Sudetenland however, the process was to take considerably longer.Rich 1974, p. 140. Eventually these nationalities were to be merged with the Germans into a single ruling race, but Hitler stated that this prospect lay \\"a hundred or so years\\" in the future. During this interim period it was intended that the 'New Europe' would be run by Germans alone. According to Speer, while Himmler intended to eventually Germanize these peoples completely, Hitler intended not to \\"infringe on their individuality\\" (that is, their native languages), so that in the future they would \\"add to the diversity and dynamism\\" of his empire.Speer 1976, p. 47. The German language would be its lingua franca however, likening it to the status of English in the British Commonwealth. A primary agent used in stifling the local extreme nationalist elements was the Germanic SS, which initially merely consisted of local respective branches of the Allgemeine-SS in Belgium, Netherlands and Norway.Bramstedt 2003, pp. 92‚Äì93. These groups were at first under the authority of their respective pro-National Socialist national commanders (De Clercq, Mussert and Quisling), and were intended to function within their own national territories only. During the course of 1942, however, the Germanic SS was further transformed into a tool used by Himmler against the influence of the less extreme collaborating parties and their SA- style organizations, such as the Hird in Norway and the Weerbaarheidsafdeling in the Netherlands.Kroener, M√ºller & Umbreit 2003, pp. 122‚Äì123. In the post- war Germanic Empire, these men were to form the new leadership cadre of their respective national territories.Morgan 2003, p. 182. To emphasize their pan- Germanic ideology, the Norges SS was now renamed the Germanske SS Norge, the Nederlandsche SS the Germaansche SS in Nederland and the Algemeene-SS Vlaanderen the Germaansche SS in Vlaanderen. The men of these groups no longer swore allegiance to their respective national leaders, but to the germanischer F√ºhrer (\\"Germanic F√ºhrer\\"), Adolf Hitler: This title was assumed by Hitler on 23 June 1941, at the suggestion of Himmler. On 12 December 1941 the Dutch right-wing nationalist Anton Mussert also addressed him in this fashion when he proclaimed his allegiance to Hitler during a visit to the Reich Chancellery in Berlin.De Jong 1974, pp. 199‚Äì200. He had wanted to address Hitler as F√ºhrer aller Germanen (\\"F√ºhrer of all Germanics\\"), but Hitler personally decreed the former style. Historian Loe de Jong speculates on the difference between the two: F√ºhrer aller Germanen implied a position separate from Hitler's role as F√ºhrer und Reichskanzler des Grossdeutschen Reiches (\\"F√ºhrer and Reich Chancellor of the Greater German Reich\\"), while germanischer F√ºhrer served more as an attribute of that main function. As late as 1944 occasional propaganda publications continued to refer to him by this unofficial title as well however.Adolf Hitler: F√ºhrer aller Germanen. Storm, 1944. Mussert held that Hitler was predestined to become the F√ºhrer of Germanics because of his congruous personal history: Hitler originally was an Austrian national, who enlisted in the Bavarian army and lost his Austrian citizenship. He thus remained stateless for seven years, during which, according to Mussert, he was \\"the Germanic leader and nothing else\\".Lipgens 1985, p. 101 The Swastika Flag was to be used as a symbol to represent not only the National Socialist movement, but also the unity of the Nordic-Germanic peoples into a single state.Rich 1974, p. 26. The swastika was seen by many National Socialists as a fundamentally Germanic and European symbol despite its presence among many cultures worldwide. Hitler had long intended to architecturally reconstruct the German capital Berlin into a new imperial metropolis, which he decided in 1942 to rename Germania upon its scheduled completion in 1950. The name was specifically chosen to make it the clear central point of the envisioned Germanic empire, and to re-enforce the notion of a united Germanic-Nordic state upon the Germanic peoples of Europe.Hitler 2000, p. 400 Policies undertaken in Germanic countries =Low countries= The German plans of annexation were more advanced for the Low Countries than for the Nordic states, due in part to their geographical proximity as well as cultural, historical and ethnic ties to Germany. Luxembourg and Belgium were both formally annexed into the German Reich during World War II, in 1942 and 1944 respectively, the latter as the new Reichsgaue of Flandern and Wallonien (the proposed third one, Brabant, was not implemented in this arrangement) and a Brussels District. On April 5, 1942, while having dinner with an entourage including Heinrich Himmler, Hitler declared his intention that the Low Countries would be included whole into the Reich, at which point the Greater German Reich would be reformed into the Germanic Reich (simply \\"the Reich\\" in common parlance) to signify this change. In October 1940 Hitler disclosed to Benito Mussolini that he intended to leave the Netherlands semi-independent because he wanted that country to retain its overseas colonial empire after the war.Rich 1974, p. 469, note 110. This factor was removed after the Japanese took over the Netherlands East Indies, the primary component of that domain. The resulting German plans for the Netherlands suggested its transformation into a Gau Westland, which would eventually be further broken- up into five new Gaue or gewesten (historical Dutch term for a type of sub- national polity). Fritz Schmidt, a ranking German official in the occupied Netherlands who hoped to become the Gauleiter of this new province on Germany's western periphery stated that it could even be called Gau Holland, as long as the Wilhelmus (the Dutch national anthem) and similar patriotic symbols were to be forbidden.De Jong 1969, Vol. 1, p. 97. Rotterdam, which had actually been largely destroyed in the course of the 1940 invasion was to be rebuilt as the most important port-city in the \\"Germanic area\\" due to its situation at the mouth of the Rhine river.Fest 1973, p. 689. Himmler's personal masseur Felix Kersten claimed that the former even contemplated resettling the entire Dutch population, some 8 million people in total at the time, to agricultural lands in the Vistula and Bug River valleys of German- occupied Poland as the most efficient way of facilitating their immediate Germanization.Waller 2002, p. 20. In this eventuality he is alleged to have further hoped to establish an SS Province of Holland in vacated Dutch territory, and to distribute all confiscated Dutch property and real estate among reliable SS-men.Kersten 1947, pp. 84‚Äì85. However this claim was shown to be a myth by Loe de Jong in his book Two Legends of the Third Reich.Louis de Jong, 1972, reprinted in German translation: H-H. Wilhelm and L. de Jong. Zwei Legenden aus dem dritten Reich : quellenkritische Studien, Deutsche Verlags- Anstalt 1974, pp 79-142. The position in the future empire of the Frisians, another Germanic people, was discussed on 5 April 1942 in one of Hitler's many wartime dinner-conversations. Himmler commented that there was ostensibly no real sense of community between the different indigenous ethnic groups in the Netherlands. He then stated that the Dutch Frisians in particular seemed to hold no affection for being part of a nation-state based on the Dutch national identity, and felt a much greater sense of kinship with their German Frisian brethren across the Ems River in East Frisia, an observation Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel agreed with based on his own experiences. Hitler determined that the best course of action in that case would be to unite the two Frisian regions on both sides of the border into a single province, and would at a later point in time further discuss the topic with Arthur Seyss-Inquart, the governor of the German regime in the Netherlands. By late May of that year these discussions were apparently concluded, as on the 29th he pledged that he would not allow the West-Frisians to remain part of Holland, and that since they were \\"part of the exact same race as the people of East Frisia\\" had to be joined into one province.Hitler (2000), 29th of May 1942. Hitler considered Wallonia to be \\"in reality German lands\\" which were gradually detached from the Germanic territories by the French Romanization of the Walloons, and that Germany thus had \\"every right\\" to take these back. Before the decision was made to include Wallonia in its entirety, several smaller areas straddling the traditional Germanic-Romance language border in Western Europe were already considered for inclusion. These included the small L√´tzebuergesh-speaking area centred on Arlon,Gildea, Wieviorka & Warring 2006, p. 130. as well as the Low Dietsch-speaking region west of Eupen (the so-called Platdietse Streek) around the city of Limbourg, historical capital of the Duchy of Limburg.Hamacher, Hertz & Keenan 1989, p. 444. =Nordic countries= After their invasion in Operation Weser√ºbung, Hitler vowed that he would never again leave Norway, and favored annexing Denmark as a German province even more due to its small size and relative closeness to Germany.Rothwell 2005, p. 32. Himmler's hopes were an expansion of the project so that Iceland would also be included among the group of Germanic countries which would have to be gradually incorporated into the Reich. He was also among the group of more esoteric National Socialists who believed either Iceland or Greenland to be the mystical land of Thule, a purported original homeland of the ancient Aryan race.Janssens 2005, p. 205. From a military point of view, the Kriegsmarine command hoped to see the Spitsbergen, Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Isles and possibly the Shetland Isles (which were also claimed by the Quisling regimePhilip H. Buss, Andrew Mollo (1978). Hitler's Germanic legions: an illustrated history of the Western European Legions with the SS, 1941-1943. Macdonald and Jane's, p. 89 ) under its domination to guarantee German naval access to the mid-Atlantic.Stegemann & Vogel 1995, p. 286 There was preparation for the construction of a new German metropolis of 300,000 inhabitants called Nordstern (\\"North Star\\") next to the Norwegian city of Trondheim. It would be accompanied by a new naval base that was intended to be Germany's largest.Weinberg 2006, pp. 26‚Äì27. This city was to be connected to Germany proper by an Autobahn across the Little and Great Belts. It would also house an art museum for the northern part of the Germanic empire, housing \\"only works of German artists.\\"Weinberg 2005, pp. 26‚Äì27. Sweden's future subordination into the 'New Order' was considered by the regime.Leitz 2000, p. 52. Himmler stated that the Swedes were the \\"epitome of the Nordic spirit and the Nordic man\\", and looked forward to incorporating central and southern Sweden to the Germanic Empire. Himmler offered northern Sweden, with its Finnish minority, to Finland, along with the Norwegian port of Kirkenes, although this suggestion was rejected by Finnish Foreign Minister Witting.Ackermann 1970, p. 191.Kersten 1957, p. 143. Felix Kersten, claimed that Himmler had expressed regret that Germany had not occupied Sweden during Operation Weser√ºbung, but was certain that this error was to be rectified after the war.Rich 1974, p. 500. In April 1942, Goebbels expressed similar views in his diary, writing that Germany should have occupied the country during its campaign in the north, as \\"this state has no right to national existence anyway\\".The Goebbels diaries, 1942-1943, p.171. In 1940, Hermann G√∂ring suggested that Sweden's future position in the Reich was similar to that of Bavaria in the German Empire. The ethnically Swedish √Öland Islands, which were awarded to Finland by the League of Nations in 1921, were likely to join Sweden in the Germanic Empire. In the spring of 1941, the German military attach√© in Helsinki reported to his Swedish counterpart that Germany would need transit rights through Sweden for the imminent invasion of the Soviet Union, and in the case of finding her cooperative would permit the Swedish annexation of the islands.Griffiths 2004, pp. 180‚Äì181. Hitler did veto the idea of a complete union between the two states of Sweden and Finland, however. Despite the majority of its people being of Finno-Ugric origin, Finland was given the status of being an \\"honorary Nordic nation\\" (from a National Socialist racial perspective, not a national one) by Hitler as reward for its military importance in the ongoing conflict against the Soviet Union.Rich 1974, p. 401. The Swedish-speaking minority of the country, who in 1941 comprised 9.6% of the total population, were considered Nordic and were initially preferred over Finnish speakers in recruitment for the Finnish Volunteer Battalion of the Waffen-SS. Finland's Nordic status did not mean however that it was intended to be absorbed into the Germanic Empire, but instead expected to become the guardian of Germany's northern flank against the hostile remnants of a conquered USSR by attaining control over Karelian territory, occupied by the Finns in 1941. Hitler also considered the Finnish and Karelian climates unsuitable for German colonization.Boog 2001, p. 922. Even so, the possibility of Finland's eventual inclusion as a federated state in the empire as a long-term objective was mulled over by Hitler in 1941, but by 1942 he seems to have abandoned this line of thinking. According to Kersten, as Finland signed an armistice with the Soviet Union and broke off diplomatic relations with her former brother-in-arms Germany in September 1944, Himmler felt remorse for not eliminating the Finnish state, government and its \\"masonic\\" leadership sooner, and transforming the country into a \\"National Socialist Finland with a Germanic outlook\\".Kersten 1947, pp. 131, 247. =Switzerland= The same implicit hostility toward neutral nations such as Sweden was also held towards Switzerland. Goebbels noted in his diary on December 18, 1941, that \\"It would be a veritable insult to God if they [the neutrals] would not only survive this war unscathed while the major powers make such great sacrifices, but also profit from it. We will certainly make sure that this will not happen.\\"Urner 2002, p. x. The Swiss people were seen by Nazi ideologists as a mere offshoot of the German nation, although one led astray by decadent Western ideals of democracy and materialism.Halbrook 1998, pp. 24‚Äì25. Hitler decried the Swiss as \\"a misbegotten branch of our Volk\\" and the Swiss state as \\"a pimple on the face of Europe\\" deeming them unsuitable for settling the territories that the Nazis expected to colonize in Eastern Europe.Hitler 2000. Himmler discussed plans with his subordinates to integrate at least the German-speaking parts of Switzerland completely with the rest of Germany, and had several persons in mind for the post of a Reichskommissar for the 're-union' of Switzerland with the German Reich (in analogy to the office that Josef B√ºrckel held after Austria's absorption into Germany during the Anschluss). Later this official was to subsequently become the new Reichsstatthalter of the area after completing its total assimilation.Fink 1985, pp. 71‚Äì72. In August 1940, Gauleiter of Westfalen-South Josef Wagner and the Minister President of Baden Walter K√∂hler spoke in favor of the amalgamation of Switzerland to Reichsgau Burgund (see below) and suggested that the seat of government for this new administrative territory should be the dormant Palais des Nations in Geneva. Operation Tannenbaum, a military offensive intended to occupy all of Switzerland, most likely in co-operation with Italy (which itself desired the Italian-speaking areas of Switzerland), was in the planning stages during 1940-1941. Its implementation was seriously considered by the German military after the armistice with France, but it was definitively shelved after the start of Operation Barbarossa had directed the attention of the Wehrmacht elsewhere.Halbrook 1998, p. 151. =Eastern France= Western Europe in the time of Charles V (1525): the Holy Roman Empire is marked by the red borders In the aftermath of the Munich Agreement, Hitler and French Prime Minister √âdouard Daladier in December 1938 made an agreement that officially declared that Germany was relinquishing its previous territorial claims on Alsace-Lorraine in the interest of maintaining peaceful relations between France and Germany and both pledged to be involved in mutual consultation on matters involving the interests of both countries.Nazi Foreign Policy, 1933‚Äì1941: The Road to Global War. p. 58. However at the same time Hitler in private advised the High Command of the Wehrmacht to prepare operational plans for a joint German‚ÄìItalian war against France. Under the auspices of State Secretary Wilhelm Stuckart the Reich Interior Ministry produced an initial memo for the planned annexation of a strip of eastern France in June 1940, stretching from the mouth of the Somme to Lake Geneva,Sch√∂ttler 2003, pp. 83‚Äì131. and on July 10, 1940, Himmler toured the region to inspect its Germanization potential. According to documents produced in December 1940, the annexed territory would consist of nine French departments, and the Germanization action would require the settlement of a million Germans from \\"peasant families\\". Himmler decided that South Tyrolean emigrants (see South Tyrol Option Agreement) would be used as settlers, and the towns of the region would receive South Tyrolean place-names such as Bozen, Brixen, Meran, and so on.Steininger 2003, p. 67. By 1942 Hitler had, however, decided that the South Tyroleans would be instead used to settle the Crimea, and Himmler regretfully noted \\"For Burgundy, we will just have to find another [Germanic] ethnic group.\\"Rich 1974, p. 384. Hitler claimed French territory even beyond the historical border of the Holy Roman Empire. He stated that in order to ensure German hegemony on the continent, Germany must \\"also retain military strong points on what was formerly the French Atlantic coast\\" and emphasized that \\"nothing on earth would persuade us to abandon such safe positions as those on the Channel coast, captured during the campaign in France and consolidated by the Organisation Todt.\\"Rich 1974, p. 198. Several major French cities along the coast were given the designation Festung (\\"fortress\\"; \\"stronghold\\") by Hitler, such as Le Havre, Brest and St. Nazaire,Zaloga 2007, p. 10. suggesting that they were to remain under permanent post-war German administration. =Atlantic islands= During the summer of 1940, Hitler considered the possibility of occupying the Portuguese Azores, Cape Verde and Madeira and the Spanish Canary islands to deny the British a staging ground for military actions against Nazi-controlled Europe.Stegemann & Vogel 1995, p. 211. In September 1940, Hitler further raised the issue in a discussion with the Spanish Foreign Minister Serrano S√∫√±er, offering now Spain to transfer one of the Canary islands to German usage for the price of French Morocco. Although Hitler's interest in the Atlantic islands must be understood from a framework imposed by the military situation of 1940, he ultimately had no plans of ever releasing these important naval bases from German control. It had been alleged by Canadian historian Holger Herwig that both in November 1940 and May 1941, leading into and through to the period in which Japan began planning the naval attack that would bring the United States into the war, that Hitler had stated that he had a desire to \\"deploy long-range bombers against American cities from the Azores.\\" Due to their location, Hitler seemed to think that a Luftwaffe airbase located on the Portuguese Azores islands were Germany's \\"only possibility of carrying out aerial attacks from a land base against the United States\\", in a period about a year before the May 1942 emergence of the Amerika Bomber trans-oceanic range strategic bomber design competition.Duffy, James P. Target America: \\"Hitler's Plan to Attack the United States\\". The Lyons Press, 2006. . Role of Britain =United Kingdom= The one country in Europe that spoke a Germanic language and was not included in the objective of Pan- Germanic unification was the United Kingdom,Rich 1974, p. 398. in spite of its near-universal acceptance by the Nazi government as being part of the Germanic world.Strobl 2000, pp. 36‚Äì60. Leading Nordic ideologist Hans F. K. G√ºnther theorized that the Anglo-Saxons had been more successful than the Germans in maintaining racial purity and that the coastal and island areas of Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall and Wales had received additional Nordic blood through Norse raids and colonization during the Viking Age, and the Anglo-Saxons of East Anglia and Northern England had been under Danish rule in the 9th and 10th centuries.Strobl 2000, p. 84. G√ºnther referred to this historical process as Aufnordung (\\"additional nordification\\"), which finally culminated in the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Thus, according to G√ºnther, Britain was thus a nation created by struggle and the survival of the fittest among the various Aryan peoples of the isles, and was able to pursue global conquest and empire-building because of its superior racial heredity born through this development.Strobl 2000, p. 85. Hitler professed an admiration for the imperial might of the British Empire in Zweites Buch as proof of the racial superiority of the Aryan race,Hitler 2003. hoping that Germany would emulate Britain in establishing its own colonial empire in Eastern Europe.Strobl 2000, p. 61. One of his primary foreign policy aims throughout the 1930s was to establish a military alliance with both the British as well as the Italians to neutralize France as a strategic threat to German security for eastward expansion into Eastern Europe. When it became apparent to the National Socialist leadership that the United Kingdom was not interested in a military alliance, anti-British policies were adopted to ensure the attainment of Germany's war aims. Even during the war however, hope remained that Britain would in time yet become a reliable German ally.Rich 1974, p. 396. Hitler preferred to see the British Empire preserved as a world power, because its break-up would benefit other countries far more than it would Germany, particularly the United States and Japan. Hitler's strategy between 1935 and 1937 for winning Britain over was based upon a German guarantee of defence towards the British Empire.Nicosia 2000, p. 73. After the war, Ribbentrop testified that in 1935 Hitler made a promise to deliver twelve German divisions to the disposal of Britain for maintaining the integrity of her colonial possessions.Nicosia 2000, p. 74. The continued military actions against Britain after the fall of France had the strategic goal of making Britain 'see the light' and conduct an armistice with the Axis powers, with July 1, 1940, being named by the Germans as the \\"probable date\\" for the cessation of hostilities.Hildebrand 1973, p. 99. On May 21, 1940, Franz Halder, the head of the Army General Staff, after a consultation with Hitler concerning the aims envisaged by the F√ºhrer during the present war, wrote in his diary: \\"We are seeking contact with Britain on the basis of partitioning the world\\".Hildebrand 1973, p. 96. One of Hitler's secondary goals for the invasion of Russia was to win over Britain to the German side. He believed that after the military collapse of the Soviet Union, \\"within a few weeks\\" Britain would be compelled either to surrender or to join Germany as a \\"junior partner\\" in the Axis.Hildebrand 1973, p. 105. Britain's role in this alliance was reserved to support German naval and the planned Amerikabomber project against the USA in a fight for world supremacy conducted from the Axis power bases of Europe, Africa and the Atlantic.Hildebrand 1973, pp. 100‚Äì105. On August 8, 1941, Hitler stated that he looked forward to the eventual day when \\"England and Germany [march] together against America\\", and on January 7, 1942, he daydreamed that it was \\"not impossible\\" for Britain to quit the war and join the Axis side, leading to a situation where \\"it will be a German- British army that will chase the Americans from Iceland\\".Pinkus 2005, p. 259. National Socialist ideologist Alfred Rosenberg hoped that after the victorious conclusion of the war against the USSR, Englishmen, along with other Germanic peoples, would join the Germans in colonizing the conquered eastern territories. From a historical perspective, Britain's situation was likened to that which the Austrian Empire found itself in after it was defeated by the Kingdom of Prussia at K√∂niggr√§tz in 1866. As Austria was thereafter formally excluded from German affairs, so too would Britain be excluded from continental affairs in the event of a German victory. Yet afterwards, Austria- Hungary became a loyal ally of the German Empire in the pre-World War I power alignments in Europe, and it was hoped in vain that Britain would come to fulfill this same role for the Third Reich. =Channel Islands= The British Channel Islands were to be permanently integrated into the Germanic Empire.Rich 1974, p. 421. On July 22, 1940, Hitler stated that after the war, the islands were to be given to the control of Robert Ley's German Labour Front, and transferred into Strength Through Joy holiday resorts.Sanders 2005, p. xxiv. German scholar Karl Heinz Pfeffer toured the islands in 1941, and recommended that the German occupiers should appeal to the islanders' Norman heritage and treat the islands as \\"Germanic micro-states\\", whose union with Britain was only an accident of history.Sanders 2005, p. 188. He likened the preferred policy concerning the islands similar to the one pursued by the British in Malta, where the Maltese language had been \\"artificially\\" supported against the Italian language. Role of Ireland A military operation plan for the invasion of Ireland in support of Operation Sea Lion was drawn up by the Germans in August 1940. Occupied Ireland was to be ruled along with Britain in a temporary administrative system divided into six military- economic commands, with one of the headquarters being situated in Dublin.Rich 1974, p. 397. Ireland's future position in the New Order is unclear, but it is known that Hitler would have united Ulster with the Irish state.Weinberg 2006, p. 35. Role of Northern Italy Hitler regarded northern Italians to be strongly Aryan,David Nicholls. Adolf Hitler: A Biographical Companion. ABC- CLIO. p. 211. but not southern Italians.Hitler: diagnosis of a destructive prophet. Oxford University Press, 2000. p. 418 He even said that the Ahnenerbe, an archaeological organization associated with the SS, asserted that archaeological evidence proved the presence of Nordic-Germanic peoples in the region of South Tyrol in the Neolithic era that it claimed proved the significance of ancient Nordic-Germanic influence on northern Italy.Ingo Haar, Michael Fahlbusch. German Scholars and Ethnic Cleansing, 1919-1945. p. 130. The NSDAP regime regarded the ancient Romans to have been largely a people of the Mediterranean race; however, they claimed that the Roman ruling classes were Nordic, descended from Aryan conquerors from the North; and that this Nordic Aryan minority was responsible for the rise of Roman civilization.Alan J. Levine. Race Relations Within Western Expansion. Praeger Publishers, 1996. p. 97. The National Socialists viewed the downfall of the Roman Empire as being the result of the deterioration of the purity of the Nordic Aryan ruling class through its intermixing with the inferior Mediterranean types that led to the empire's decay. In addition, racial intermixing in the population in general was also blamed for Rome's downfall, claiming that Italians were a hybrid of races, including black African races. Due to the darker complexion of Mediterranean peoples, Hitler regarded them as having traces of Negroid blood and therefore did not have strong Nordic Aryan heritage and were thus inferior to those that had stronger Nordic heritage.Andrew Vincent. Modern Political Ideologies. John Wiley & Sons, 2009, p. 308. Hitler held immense admiration for the Roman Empire and its legacy.Alex Scobie. Hitler's State Architecture: The Impact of Classical Antiquity. pp. 21-22. Hitler praised post-Roman era achievements of northern Italians such as Sandro Botticelli, Michelangelo, Dante Alighieri, and Benito Mussolini.R J B Bosworth. Mussolini's Italy: Life Under the Dictatorship, 1915-1945 The Nazis ascribed the great achievements of post-Roman era northern Italians to the presence of Nordic racial heritage in such people who via their Nordic heritage had Germanic ancestors, such as NSDAP Foreign Affairs official Alfred Rosenberg recognizing Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci as exemplary Nordic men of history.David B. Dennis. Inhumanities: Nazi Interpretations of Western Culture. Cambridge University Press, 2012. p. 17-19. German official Hermann Hartmann wrote that Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was clearly Nordic with deep Germanic roots because of his blond hair, blue eyes, and long face. The Nazis claimed that aside from biologically Nordic people that a Nordic soul could inhabit a non-Nordic body.Jo Groebel, Robert A. Hinde. Aggression and War: Their Biological and Social Bases. Cambridge University Press, 1989. p. 159. Hitler emphasized the role of Germanic influence in Northern Italy, such as stating that the art of Northern Italy was \\"nothing but pure German\\",Rich 1974, p. 317. and National Socialist scholars viewed that the Ladin and Friulian minorities of Northern Italy were racially, historically and culturally a part of the Germanic world.Wedekind 2006, pp. 113, 122‚Äì123. To put it bluntly, Hitler declared in private talks that the modern Reich should emulate the racial policy of the old Roman-Germanic Holy Empire, by annexing the Italian lands and especially Lombardy, whose population had well preserved their original Germanic Aryan character, unlike the lands of East Europe, with its racially alien population, scarcely marked by a Germanic contribution.Norman Cameron, R. H. Stevens. Hitler's Table Talk, 1941-1944: His Private Conversations. Enigma Books, 2000. p. 287. According to him, German are more closely linked with the Italians than with any other people: The Nazi regime's stances in regards to northern Italy was influenced by the regime's relations with the Italian government, and particularly Mussolini's Fascist regime. Hitler deeply admired and emulated Mussolini. Hitler emphasized the racial closeness of his ally Mussolini to Germans of Alpine racial heritage.Richard Breiting, Adolf Hitler, √âdouard Calic (ed.). Secret conversations with Hitler:the two newly-discovered 1931 interviews. John Day Co., 1971. p. 77. Hitler regarded Mussolini to not be seriously contaminated by the blood of the Mediterranean race. Other National Socialists had negative views of Mussolini and the Fascist regime. The NSDAP's first leader, Anton Drexler was one of the most extreme in his negative views of Mussolini ‚Äì claiming that Mussolini was \\"probably\\" a Jew and that Fascism was a Jewish movement.R. J. B. Bosworth. Mussolini. Bloomsbury, 2014. In addition there was a perception in Germany of Italians being racially weak, feckless, corrupt and corrupting, bad soldiers as perceived as demonstrated at the Battle of Caporetto in World War I, for being part of the powers that established the Treaty of Versailles, and for being a treacherous people given Italy's abandonment of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary in World War I to join the Entente. Hitler responded to the review of Italy betraying Germany and Austria-Hungary in World War I by saying that this was a consequence of Imperial Germany's decision to focus its attention on upholding the moribund Austro-Hungarian empire while ignoring and disregarding the more promising Italy. The region of South Tyrol had been a place of contending claims and conflict between German nationalism and Italian nationalism. One of the leading founders of Italian nationalism, Giuseppe Mazzini, along with Ettore Tolomei, claimed that the German-speaking South Tyrolian population were in fact mostly a Germanicized population of Roman origin who needed to be \\"liberated and returned to their rightful culture\\".Jens Woelk, Francesco Palermo, Joseph Marko. Tolerance Through Law: Self Governance and Group Rights In South Tyrol. Leiden, Netherlands: Koninlijke Brill NV, 2008. p. 5. With the defeat of Austria-Hungary in World War I, the peace treaty designated to Italy the South Tyrol, with its border with Austria along the Brenner Pass. The Italian Fascist regime pursued Italianization of South Tyrol, by restricting use of the German language while promoting the Italian language; promoting mass migration of Italians into the region, encouraged mainly through industrialization; and resettlement of the German-speaking population.Jens Woelk, Francesco Palermo, Joseph Marko. Tolerance Through Law: Self Governance and Group Rights In South Tyrol. Leiden, Netherlands: Koninlijke Brill NV, 2008. p. 6. After Mussolini had made clear in 1922 that he would never give up the region of South Tyrol from being in Italy, Hitler adopted this position.Christian Leitz. Nazi Foreign Policy, 1933-1941: The Road to Global War. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: p. 10. Hitler in Mein Kampf had declared that concerns over the rights of Germans in South Tyrol under Italian sovereignty was a non-issue considering the advantages that would be gained from a German-Italian alliance with Mussolini's Fascist regime.H. James Burgwyn. Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, 1918‚Äì1940. Wesport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997. p. 81. In Mein Kampf Hitler also made clear that he was opposed to having a war with Italy for the sake of obtaining South Tyrol. This position by Hitler of abandoning German land claims to South Tyrol produced aggravation among some NSDAP members who up to the late 1920s found it difficult to accept the position. On 7 May 1938, Hitler during a public visit to Rome declared his commitment to the existing border between Germany (that included Austria upon the Anschluss) and Italy at the Brenner Pass.Rolf Steininger. South Tyrol: A Minority Conflict of the Twentieth Century. p. 49. In 1939, Hitler and Mussolini resolved the problem of self-determination of Germans and maintaining the Brenner Pass frontier by an agreement in which German South Tyroleans were given the choice of either assimilation into Italian culture, or leave South Tyrol for Germany; most opted to leave for Germany. After King Victor Emmanuel III of the Kingdom of Italy removed Mussolini from power, Hitler on 28 July 1943 was preparing for the expected abandonment of the Axis for the Allies by the Kingdom of Italy's new government, and was preparing to exact retribution for the expected betrayal by planning to partition Italy.Allen Welsh Dulles, Neal H. Petersen, United States. Office of Strategic Services. Bern Office. From Hitler's Doorstep: The Wartime Intelligence Reports of Allen Dulles, 1942-1945. Pennsylvania State Press, 1996. In particular Hitler was considering the creation of a \\"Lombard State\\" in northern Italy that would be incorporated into the Greater Germanic Reich, while South Tyrol and Venice would be annexed directly into Germany. In the aftermath of the Kingdom of Italy's abandonment of the Axis on 8 September 1943, Germany seized and de facto incorporated Italian territories into its direct control.Dr Susan Zuccotti, Furio Colombo. The Italians and the Holocaust: Persecution, Rescue, and Survival. University of Nebraska Press paperback edition, 1996. p. 148. After the Kingdom of Italy capitulated to the Allies in September 1943, according to Goebbels in his personal diary on 29 September 1943, Hitler had expressed that the Italian- German border should extend to those of the region of Veneto.Petacco 2005, p. 50. Veneto was to be included into the Reich in an \\"autonomous form\\", and to benefit from the post-war influx of German tourists. At the time when Italy was on the verge of declaring an armistice with the Allies, Himmler declared to Felix Kersten that Northern Italy, along with the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, was \\"bound to eventually be included in Greater Germany anyway\\".Kersten 1947, p. 186. After the rescue of Mussolini and the establishment of the Italian Social Republic (RSI), in spite of urging by local German officials, Hitler refused to officially annex South Tyrol, instead he decided that the RSI should hold official sovereignty over these territories, and forbade all measures that would give the impression of official annexation of South Tyrol.Rolf Steininger. South Tyrol: A Minority Conflict of the Twentieth Century. p. 69. However, in practice the territory of South Tyrol within the boundaries defined by Germany as Operationszone Alpenvorland that included Trent, Bolzano, and Belluno, were de facto incorporated into Germany's Reichsgau Tirol-Vorarlberg and administered by its Gauleiter Franz Hofer.Giuseppe Motta. The Italian Military Governorship in South Tyrol and the Rise of Fascism. English translation edition. Edizioni Nuova Cultura, 2012. p. 104. While the region identified by Germany as Operationszone Adriatisches K√ºstenland that included Udine, Gorizia, Trieste, Pola, Fiume (Rijeka), and Ljubljana were de facto incorporated into Reichsgau K√§rnten and administered by its Gauleiter Friedrich Rainer.Arrigo Petacco. Tragedy Revealed: The Story of Italians from Istria, Dalmatia, and Venezia Giulia, 1943-1956. Toronto, Ontario, Canada: University of Toronto Press, 2005. p. 50. In a supplementary OKW order dated 10 September 1943, Hitler decrees on the establishment of further Operational Zones in Northern Italy, which were the stretch all the way to the French border.Kroener, M√ºller, Umbreit (2003), Germany and the Second World War: Volume V/II: Organization and Mobilization in the German Sphere of Power: Wartime Administration, Economy, and Manpower Resources 1942-1944/5, p. 79, Unlike Alpenvorland and K√ºstenland, these zones did not immediately receive high commissioners (oberster kommissar) as civilian advisors, but were military regions where the commander was to exercise power on behalf of Army Group B. Operation zone Nordwest-Alpen or Schweizer Grenze was located between the Stelvio Pass and Monte Rosa and was to contain wholly the Italian provinces of Sondrio and Como and parts of the provinces of Brescia, Varese, Novara and Vercelli.Wedekind 2003, Nationalsozialistische Besatzungs- und Annexionspolitik in Norditalien 1943 bis 1945, pp. 100‚Äì101 The zone of Franz√∂sische Grenze was to encompass areas west of Monte Rosa and was to incorporate the province of Aosta and a part of the province of Turin, and presumably also the provinces of Cuneo and Imperia. From Autumn 1943 onward, members of the Ahnenerbe, associated with the SS, asserted that archaeological evidence of ancient farmsteads and architecture proved the presence of Nordic-Germanic peoples in the region of South Tyrol in the Neolithic era including prototypical Lombard style architecture, the significance of ancient Nordic-Germanic influence on Italy, and most importantly that South Tyrol by its past and present and historic racial and cultural circumstances, was \\"Nordic-Germanic national soil\\". Expected participation in the colonization of Eastern Europe Gro√üdeutsches Reich in 1942, with Reichskommissariat Ostland (upper centre), Reichskommissariat Ukraine (lower right) and (never fully realized) Reichskommissariat Moskowien Despite the pursued aim of pan-Germanic unification, the primary goal of the German Reich's territorial expansionism was to acquire sufficient Lebensraum (living space) in Eastern Europe for the Germanic √ºbermenschen or superior men. The primary objective of this aim was to transform Germany into a complete economic autarky, the end-result of which would be a state of continent-wide German hegemony over Europe. This was to be accomplished through the enlargement of the territorial base of the German state and the expansion of the German population,Rich 1974, p. 331. and the wholesale extermination of the indigenous Slavic inhabitants and the Germanisation of Baltic inhabitants.Madajczyk. Because of their perceived racial worth, the NSDAP leadership was enthusiastic at the prospect of \\"recruiting\\" people from the Germanic countries to also settle these territories after the Slavic inhabitants would have been driven out.Poprzeczny 2004, p. 181. The racial planners were partly motivated in this because studies indicated that Germany would likely not be able to recruit enough colonial settlers for the eastern territories from its own country and other Germanic groups would therefore be required. Hitler insisted however that German settlers would have to dominate the newly colonized areas. Himmler's original plan for the Hegewald settlement was to settle Dutch and Scandinavians there in addition to Germans, which was unsuccessful.Nicholas 2006, pp. 330-331 Later development As the foreign volunteers of the Waffen-SS were increasingly of non-Germanic origin, especially after the Battle of Stalingrad, among the organization's leadership (e.g. Felix Steiner) the proposition for a Greater Germanic Empire gave way to a concept of a European union of self-governing states, unified by German hegemony and the common enemy of Bolshevism. The Waffen-SS was to be the eventual nucleus of a common European army where each state would be represented by a national contingent. Himmler himself, however, gave no concession to these views, and held on to his Pan-Germanic vision in a speech given in April 1943 to the officers of SS divisions LSAH, Das Reich and Totenkopf: See also *Administrative divisions of Nazi Germany *Areas annexed by Nazi Germany *Fourth Reich *German-occupied Europe *Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere *Hitler's plans for North America *Hypothetical Axis victory in World War II *Italian imperialism under Fascism *Japanese colonial empire *Kleindeutschland and Grossdeutschland *Latin Bloc (proposed alliance) *New Order (Nazism), Nazi concept for a post-World War II world order *Pan movements *Racial policy of Nazi Germany References Informational notes Citations Bibliography                     * * External links *Map detailing the early political plans for the creation of the Greater Germanic Reich Category:Irredentism Category:Politics of Nazi Germany Category:Germany in World War II Category:Pan-nationalism Category:Proposed countries Category:German words and phrases Category:Pan-Germanism ","title":"Greater Germanic Reich"},{"id":"28243179","text":"Gunther Uhlmann Gunther Alberto Uhlmann Arancibia (9 February 1952, Chile) is a mathematician whose research focuses on inverse problems and imaging, microlocal analysis, partial differential equations and invisibility.

To play the user must walk to these ghosts, if within range the user can scan and find out what kind of ghost is nearby as well as how far said ghost is from their current position. If the user is unable to reach a ghost, a horn may be blown which makes all nearby ghosts flee and possibly stop within reach of another accessible location. The user catches ghosts by tilting their phone to the \\"camera-position\\". Through the camera the user can scan the ghosts, see the ghosts in augmented reality and of course catch the ghosts.

The southernmost extremity, Parassala, is just away from the southern peninsular tip of India, Cape Comorin (Kanya Kumari). The district stretches along the shores of the Arabian Sea on the west, Kollam district lies on the north with Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari districts of Tamil Nadu on the east and south respectively. Unlike the flat portion of the Kerala coast, at the northern coastal region cliffs are found adjacent to the Arabian Sea at Varkala. These tertiary sedimentary formation cliffs are considered as a unique geological feature. It is known among geologists as the \\"Varkala Formation\\" and a geological monument as declared by the Geological Survey of India. The district can be divided into three geographical regions: Highlands, Midlands, and Lowlands. The Varkala, Chirayinkeezhu and Thiruvananthapuram taluks are in the midland and lowland regions, the Nedumangad taluk lies in the midland and highland regions, and the Neyyattinkara taluk stretches over all three. The highland regions on the east and the northeast comprises the Western Ghats. This area is ideal for major cash crops like rubber, tea, cardamom and other spices. Timber trees like teak and rosewood are grown in this region. The Ghats maintain an average elevation of . The part Agasthyarkoodam, which is the second-highest peak in the Western Ghats ( above sea level), lies in the district. The forests in the tail end of Western Ghats form the most diverse and unknown ecosystem in Peninsular India. The midland region lying between the Western Ghats and lowlands is made up of small and tiny hills and valleys. This is an area of intense agricultural activities. This region is rich in produce such as paddy, tapioca, rubber, eucalyptus, spices and cashews. The lowlands are comparatively narrow, consisting of rivers, deltas and seashore.

These forests may be broadly classified into three categories: Southern tropical wet evergreen forests, Southern tropical and semi-evergreen forests, and Southern tropical moist deciduous forests. Social forestry programmes are being implemented under the World Bank-aided Kerala Social Forestry Project, National Rural Employment Programme (NREP) and Rural Fuel Wood Schemes to assist small and marginal farmers. =Rivers= Edava-Nadayara lake Near Thekkumbhagam-Kappil Among the three rivers in the district, the Neyyar (), the southernmost river of the Kerala state, has its origin in the Agasthyamala, the second-highest peak in the Western Ghats.

It stars Marion Cotillard, Gong Tao, Emily Stofle, Cheng Hong, Lu Yong and Nie Fei, with music by Lynch, Dean Hurley, and Nathaniel Shilkret. The film centers on the surreal circumstances surrounding Cotillard's character, who encounters a mysterious Dior handbag and 1920s music as she enters her hotel room in Shanghai. It has been likened thematically to Lynch's 2006 feature film Inland Empire. Background David Lynch's previous work with fashion companies includes advert collaborations with Gucci, Calvin Klein and Yves Saint Laurent. According to Lynch, he was contacted by Dior with some basic guidelines: > They called me up and said, 'Would you like to make a short film for the > internet? You can do anything you want, you just need to show the handbag, > the Pearl Tower and some old Shanghai.' ... This falls between a regular > film and a commercial. I liked that idea. There are adverts and people get > hit hard, and then there is this, where it is like coming at it from a > different angle. The short film is Marion Cotillard's third appearance in a Dior promotional project. Of Cotillard, Lynch stated: \\"She has got that modern quality and old quality that I think the great ones have always.\\" Plot Cotillard, whose character is not given a name in the film, enters her Shanghai hotel room at night. As she nears her room she hears a 1920s tango, which, as she opens her hotel room door, she sees is coming from an old 78 rpm record playing on a vintage record player.\\"Fate (Tango Valentino)\\", composed by Nathaniel Shilkret and recorded in 1926 by him directing the International Novelty Orchestra, played in the film on a circa 1940 RCA Victor machine. She stops the music, and instantly an expensive Dior bag appears in the room in a puff of smoke. In a panic, she calls the front desk to say that someone is in her room. Two security guards search her room and find nobody. She is questioned about the bag and asked if it could have been left by someone she knows. At first she says she just arrived in Shanghai and knows nobody, but then she reluctantly relates, through a flashback, what seemed like a vision to her as she went to see the Shanghai Oriental Pearl Tower that afternoon. The vision is of her seeing Shanghai as it was at an earlier time and going up some stairs to a room in which she saw a Chinese man named Yu (Gong Tao). As they kiss and profess their love for each other, the scene changes to modern Shanghai, and the man says he wants to stay, but can not. As the vision of her lover fades, he hands her a blue rose and the flashback ends. Cotillard is in tears. She opens the bag and finds a blue rose. The picture ends with her clutching the bag to her heart.

As such, the eCOTOOL project primarily dealt with initial and continuing vocational education and training (VET) in the European Union. The objective of eCOTOOL was to improve the development, exchange, and maintenance of VET certificates and their accessibility and transparency by harmonizing Europass with other European instruments (EQF, ECVETECVET) and e‚Äêcompetences. This aimed to increase European mobility and the transparency of VET systems. eCOTOOL focused on: # the improvement of the development, exchange, and maintenance of vocational education and training (VET) certificates and their accessibility and transparency and # increasing European mobility and transparency in general. In an attempt to achieve these objectives eCOTOOL developed the adaptable Europass CS eco‚Äêtools based on the European policies Europass Certificate Supplement (CS), EQF, ECVET, and PAS 1093. The Europass CS eco‚Äêtools were first tested and evaluated in the agricultural sector. Finally the eCOTOOL results were submitted to the European Standardization Committees (CEN/TC 353) to contribute to a European consensus and standard for VET competences.  Overview  The overall objective of the eCOTOOL project was to improve the development, exchange, and maintenance of VET certificates and their accessibility and transparency by harmonizing Europass with other European instruments (EQF, ECVET) and e‚Äêcompetences. This attempted to increase the European mobility and transparency of VET systems through: # The development of an Application Profile and Technical Tools based on the Europass Certificate Supplement (CS) under the Brand \\"Europass CS eco‚Äêtools\\" # The Adaptation of all Europass CS eco‚Äêtools to the Agricultural Sector and their Pilot Testing and Optimization The eCOTOOL project attempted to provide advanced and sustainable instruments and tools for the Europass CS: First an application profile was developed as an information model from the European instruments to become the European standard for certificate repositories based on the Europass CS specification.  Project Outcome  The main benefits of the Europass CS eco‚Äêtools are: * Better accessibility to existing Europass Certificate Supplements (CS) by ensuring full interoperability amongst any given IT system * Easier development and maintenance of further Europass Certificate Supplements * Simple exchange of Europass Certificate Supplements between any online platforms and repositories * Enhancing European mobility by improving comparisons of VET solutions and their certificatesADAM Database entry for eCOTOOL  Brief description of the eCOTOOL products  First an application profile was developed as an information model from the European instruments to become the European standard for certificate repositories based on the Europass CS specification. This information model was delivered with a full XML binding to complete the Europass CS eco‚Äêtools and to support and facilitate their dissemination to and application in all European countries. The application profile: The application profile was disseminated and populated at the website and was freely accessible, applicable and adaptable for all interested European stakeholders. It attempted to facilitate the further development, the maintenance of existing, and the harmonization of all future Europass Certificate Supplements within Europe by this information model which is adaptable and applicable within any branch or sector. The application profile is information model that is needed for the development of the technical tools (WP2). It retains full interoperability with Europass CS and integrate the models and taxonomies of EQF, ECVET and e‚Äêcompetences. The technical tools: The technical tools (XML bindings) attempted to facilitate the exchange of VET certificates between any information systems, databases, online platforms, and repositories for easier and better accessibility, development, and maintenance. The Europass CS Technical Tools are data models as complete XML bindings including a XML Schema Description (XSD) for the implementation within different IT systems and repositories. The adaptation of the Europass CS eco‚Äêtools to the agricultural sector: The Europass CS eco‚Äêtools consist of both: the adapted Europass CS application profile and the adapted Europass CS technical tools in six languages. Freely available on the online platform, the adapted Europass CS eco‚Äêtools attempted to facilitate the implementation, maintenance, exchange, and harmonization of Certificate Supplements within the agricultural sector. The adaptation of the Europass CS eco‚Äêtools includes the application profile as well as the technical tools by adding and integrating specific requirements of the agricultural sector. That covers agricultural terminology, metadata, and taxonomies as well as methodologies, settings, and didactical principles that are typical for the agricultural sector. The adaptation includes the translations for the user countries of pilot testing. A summary and comparison of all identified VET requirements and needs is also available as one main input for the adaptation of the Europass CS eco‚Äêtools to the agricultural sector. The results of the eCOTOOL Project are being used by other current European research projects, including the AGRICOM Project and the Compat.egov Project.

All stories in the book have their own protagonists, but are related to each other by the use of literary leitmotivs. None of the stories has its own title. Ende wrote the 30 short stories - according to the dedication at the beginning of the book - for his father Edgar Ende, whose artistic work (the book is illustrated with 18 of his paintings) inspired the short stories.  Themes and motives  The main motive of the collection is the question \\"What is reflected in a mirror which is reflected in a mirror?\\" Ende does not provide a clear answer to this question during the course of the book. In a letter, he stated that he intended the title to be taken as a metaphor for the relationship between reader and the book: :\\"That brings me to the real reason for the title: Where does that which happens during reading a book take place? (...) Does not every reader, whether he wants it or not, bring (...) his own experiences and thoughts into the process of reading? (...) Is not every book a mirror in which the reader is reflected, whether he knows it or not? And is not every reader a mirror in which the book is reflected?\\" Recurring motives are the question about the purpose of life, a constant waiting for something which is never to happen, a search for freedom and the criticism of an inhuman society. Most of the stories do not allow for a clear interpretation; instead, as Ende himself stated: :\\"If one claims to have 'understood' something or to be able to 'explain' something, that usually means nothing more than to reduce it to something known before, to something familiar. (...) While writing this book I intended to invite the reader to something of a free game, where the content of imagination or consciousness is constantly destroyed or transformed so that it becomes impossible to cling to it.\\"  Reception  The Mirror in the Mirror was translated into 13 languages and was made into an audiobook.

A dynamic and charismatic King, he led the Xhosa armies in several of the Cape- Xhosa Frontier Wars. Having recently been equipped with modern fire-arms, Sandile's forces successfully inflicted losses on their enemies that led to Sandile gaining a reputation as a Xhosa hero. He was captured during the War of the Axe in 1847, but on his release he was granted land in \\"British Kaffraria\\" for his people. He later supported Sarhili (Kreli), King of the Gcaleka, in a war against the Cape Colony and the Fingo tribe, and he was killed in 1878 in a shootout with Fingo soldiers. Early life Chief Mgolombane Sandile (right), with councillors He was born at Burnshill in 1820, at which time the Xhosa lands were still independent. His father Ngqika (after whom the entire Ngqika clan of Xhosa were named) died in 1829 while Sandile was still quite young and Maqoma, Sandile‚Äôs brother, acted as Regent until 1872 when Sandile was installed as King. Sandile was born with one leg shorter than the other, which made it difficult for him to walk, but he nevertheless played an important role in the Frontier Wars. The Xhosa nation had long been divided between the eastern Gcaleka (ruled at the time by Sarhili) and Sandile's Rharhabe to the west. However Sarhili, also known as \\"Kreli\\", had a role akin to paramount-king of all the Xhosa. The Seventh Frontier War (1846-47) The 7th Frontier War was also known as the \\"War of the Axe\\" or the \\"Amatola War\\". =Background to the war= The amaFengu, notoriously skilled sharpshooters and allies of the Cape Colony, were initially the only group to successfully resist Sandile's armies. Tension had been simmering between farmers and marauders, on both sides of the frontier, since the previous conflict. A severe drought forced desperate Xhosa to engage in cattle raids across the frontier in order to survive. In addition, land that had been captured in the previous war was scheduled by the government to be given back to the Xhosa. However there was great agitation via the Graham's Town Journal, of Eastern Cape settlers who wanted to annexe and settle this territory. The event that actually ignited the war was a trivial dispute over a raid. A Khoikhoi escort was transporting a manacled Xhosa thief to Grahamstown to be tried for stealing an axe, when he was attacked and killed by Xhosa raiders. Sandile refused to surrender the murderer and war broke out in March 1846. In addition to the regular British columns, the war involved several groups of mixed \\"Burgher forces\\", comprising mainly Khoi, Fengu and Boer Commandos, who were recruited locally to fight on the colonial side under their leader Andries Stockenstrom. In the ensuing war, Sandile's Ngqika were assisted by portions of the Ndlambe, and the Thembu. His forces outnumbered the colonials by over ten times, and had by this time replaced their traditional weapons with modern firearms. It was their new use of guns that made the Xhosa considerably more effective in fighting the British.\\"Conquest of the Eastern Cape 1779-1878\\" , South African History Online. =Sandile's initial victories= Sketch of the shoot-out as British Imperial Troops attempt to storm Sandile's position in the Amatola Mountains. Shoot-out between Xhosa and a slow-moving British army column. Sandile's forces won initial victories over the regular British forces. A slow British column, sent to confront Sandile, was temporarily delayed at the Amatola Mountains and Xhosa raiders were able to quickly capture the centre of the three-mile-long wagon train, which was not being defended - carrying away the British supplies. Sandile then poured his forces across the border as the outnumbered British fell back, abandoning their outposts. The only successful resistance was from the local Mfengu people, who defended their villages from the far larger Xhosa forces. On 28 May, 8,000 of Sandile's men attacked the last remaining British garrison, at Fort Peddie, but fell back after a long shootout with British and Fingo troops. His army then marched on Grahamstown itself, but was held up when a sizeable army of Ndlambe Xhosa were defeated on 7 June 1846 by General Somerset on the Gwangu, a few miles from Fort Peddie. Both Xhosa and colonials were by now considerably hampered by drought. =Involvement of the Cape \\"Burgher\\" commandos= In desperation, the British called in Stockenstrom and the local Cape Burgher forces whose fast-moving commandos, with their considerable local knowledge, inflicted a string of defeats on Sandile's Ngqika.\\"General South African History Timeline: 1800s\\" , South African History Online. The commandos then rode deep into the Transkei Xhosa heartland, eventually riding right into the village of Gcaleka King Sarhili himself, the paramount chief of all the Xhosa, and negotiating with him an overall treaty, for peace with all Xhosa. =Later stages of the war= However, disagreements between these local Burghers and the regular British Imperial army caused Stockenstrom's commandos to withdraw from the war, leaving the British and the Xhosa - both starving and afflicted by fever - to a long, drawn-out war of attrition. The effects of the drought were worsened through the use, by both sides, of scorched earth tactics. Gradually, as the armies weakened, the conflict subsided into waves of petty and bloody recriminations. At one point, violence flared up again after Ngqika tribesmen supposedly stole four goats from the neighbouring Kat River Settlement. Sandile gained considerable respect for successfully eluding the British during their intensive sweeps of the Amatola forests, in spite of his physical disability. The war continued until Sandile was eventually captured during negotiations, and sent to Grahamstown. Though he was later released, the other Xhosa chiefs gradually laid down their arms. On 23 December 1847, the Keiskamma to upper Kei region was annexed as the British Kaffraria Colony, with King William's Town as capital. The Eighth Frontier War (1850‚Äì53) Also known as \\"Mlanjeni's War\\". Bitter at their recent defeat in the War of the Axe, the Xhosa found hope in a new prophet Mlanjeni, who predicted that the Xhosa would be unaffected by the colonists' bullets and promised supernatural aid to assist in the overthrow of their white neighbours. =Initial victories= Believing that the chiefs were responsible for the unrest caused by Mlanjeni's preaching, Governor Sir Harry Smith travelled to British Kaffraria to meet with the prominent chiefs. Sandile refused to attend a meeting outside Fort Cox, as he distrusted Governor Smith's motives, so Smith ordered him deposed and declared him a fugitive. On 24 December, a British detachment sent to arrest Sandile was ambushed by Xhosa warriors in the Boomah Pass. The party was forced to retreat to Fort White under heavy fire. The Xhosa forces advanced into the colony and British Kaffraria erupted in a massive uprising in December 1850, joined by half-Khoi, half-Xhosa chief Hermanus Matroos, and by large numbers of the Kat River Khoikhoi. British military villages along the frontier were burned, and the post at Line Drift captured. =Setbacks= Insurgents defend a stronghold in the forested Water Kloof during the 8th Xhosa war of 1851. Xhosa, Kat River Khoi-khoi and some army deserters are depicted. After these initial successes, however, the Xhosa experienced a series of setbacks. Xhosa forces were repulsed in separate attacks on Fort White and Fort Hare. Similarly, on January 7, Hermanus and his supporters launched an offensive on the town of Fort Beaufort, which was defended by a small detachment of troops and local volunteers. The attack failed and Hermanus was killed. =Involvement of the local Cape commandos= By the end of January, the imperial troops had received local reinforcements from the Cape Colony, and a force under Colonel Mackinnon was able to successfully drive north from King William's Town to re-supply the beleaguered garrisons at Fort White, Fort Cox and Fort Hare. They expelled the remainder of Hermanus' rebel forces (now under the command of Willem Uithaalder) from Fort Armstrong, and drove them west toward the Amatola Mountains. Insurgents led by Sandile's brother Maqoma established themselves in the forested Water Kloof, and held out for a considerable time in this stronghold. =Aftermath and the Cattle-killing= The 8th frontier war was the most bitter and brutal in the series of Xhosa wars. It lasted over two years and ended in the complete subjugation of the Ciskei Xhosa. Following the cessation of hostilities, the Xhosa, in desperation, turned to the millennialist movement (1856‚Äì1858) of the Prophetess Nongqawuse, which began in neighbouring Transkei 1856, and led them to destroy their own means of subsistence in the belief that it would bring about salvation by supernatural spirits. While the ensuing famine effected primarily the Gcaleka on the other side of the Kei, it also caused hardship among Sandile's people, and a wave of impoverished refugees. After 1858 however, hostilities died down and peace returned to the frontier. The Cape Colony received representative and then responsible government and instituted the multi-racial Cape Qualified Franchise in an attempt to make its political system more inclusive. As expansionist pressure against the Xhosa also eased, and the Cape economy boomed in the early 1870s, the frontier saw over a decade of relative quiet. The Ninth Frontier War (1877‚Äì79) A series of devastating droughts across the Transkei began to place severe strain on the relative peace which had prevailed for the previous few decades. As the historian De Kiewiet memorably said: \\"In South Africa, the heat of drought easily becomes the fever of war .\\"Kiewiet, Cornelis W. de (1941), A History of South Africa, Social and Economic., Oxford, England: Clarendon Press. p.105 The droughts had begun as early as 1875 in Gcalekaland and had spread to other parts of the Transkei and Basutoland, and even into the Cape Colony controlled Ciskei. Their severity increased up until 1877 when they were the worst ever recorded, and ethnic tensions began to break out, particularly between the Mfengu, the Thembu and the Gcaleka Xhosa.J. Fage, R. Oliver: The Cambridge History of Africa, Volume 6 (1870-1905). Cambridge University Press, 1985. p.387.C. Bundy: The Rise and Fall of South African Peasantry. University of California Press, 1979. p.83. This 9th War (also known as the Mfengu-Gcaleka War) started outside of the Cape's frontier in neighbouring Transkei, after the supposed harassing of the Mfengu/Fingo people, by Sarhili's Gcaleka Xhosa. An initial bar fight rapidly expanded into inter-tribal violence across the Cape frontier. The Cape Colony was swiftly pulled into the conflict as they were traditional allies of the Fengu, and the British Governor got involved with the intention of using the war as a pretext to annex the final independent Xhosa state, Gcalekaland. In the complex, multi-sided war that followed, the Gcaleka called upon Sandile to join the conflict by declaring war on the Cape Colony. Sandile, who on his previous release had been granted land in \\"British Kaffraria\\" for his people, was initially uncertain about going to war. His Councillors and Chiefs all advised him not to, but his younger generation of warriors were persuaded by the Gcaleka appeal. Eventually, he fatally threw in his lot with Sarhili and his Gcaleka armies. The armies of the Fingo and the Cape Colony soon emerged victorious, Sandile was killed in a shootout with Fingo soldiers in 1878, and all remaining Xhosa territory then became part of the Cape Colony. Death On 29 May 1878, Sandile was mortally wounded in a shoot-out with a detachment of Fengu troops (the Fengu were a Xhosa-speaking nation who had long suffered oppression at the hands of the Gcaleka Xhosa, and had consequently become traditional allies of the Cape Colony). He died a few days later and his body was brought to a nearby military camp. Widely admired by this time, he was given a full military funeral at which his body was carried on eight rifles by Fingo pall- bearers. Sandile was buried by the graves of British soldiers A. Dicks and F. Hillier, who were killed in the same war. Sandile's grave is today about 16 kilometres from Stutterheim at the foothills of the Amatola Mountains where he fought many of his campaigns. A memorial plaque erected at the grave site in 1941 reads as follows: SANDILE Chief of the Gaikas. Born about 1820 Killed in the Ninth Kaffir War 1877/1878 and buried here on 9.6.1878 Recent excavations - overseen by the local Xhosa community - have confirmed the body's identity and dispelled centuries-old rumours that Sandile was posthumously decapitated. He was survived by his daughter, Emma Sandile, who later became a landowner in the Cape Colony.

The total area of the park is 117 km¬≤ (45 sq mi). Belasitsa is part of the European ecological network NATURA 2000 and is managed by the Belasitsa Nature Park Directorate which is a legal entity under the authority of the Executive Forest Agency of Ministry of Agriculture and Food. The Directorate office is located in the village of Kolarovo. The nature park is bordered to the west by North Macedonia and to the south by Greece, both of which contain regions of Belasitsa Mountain. Belasitsa Nature Park includes the villages of Gabrene, Skrut, Klyuch, Yavornitsa, Kamena, Samuilovo, Kolarovo, Belasitsa, and Petrich, all located in the municipality of Petrich, Blagoevgrad Province.  History  The initial process to conserve biodiversity in Belasitsa Mountain started in 1988 with the creation of the Kongur Reserve. It was declared by Order 671 of the Committee for Environmental Protection of 06.15.1988. The purpose of the order was to protect natural forest ecosystems of common chestnut and beech trees. At the base of the mountain lies Topilishte protected area, declared by Order 328 of 05.08.1992. The order was designed to protect Royal and Majestic Fern. Belasitsa was named to the Order RD-925 from 12.27.2007 of the Minister of Environment and Water in Bulgaria and is the newest nature park in the country.  Flora  Viola stojanowii Around 1500 plant species have been found in Belasitsa Nature Park, including Bulgarian and Balkan endemites, species protected by the Law on Biological Diversity, species included in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and species included in the Red Book of Bulgaria. Some of the plant species protected in the forst include common beech, common chestnut (largest deposit in the country), common yew, European holly, Heldreich's maple, Albanian lily, and Medicago carstiensis.  Fauna  Salamandra salamandra The fauna in Belasitsa are affected by two main attributes of the mountain: location and altitude. Belasitsa Mountain is in the southwesternmost part of Bulgaria and is part of the Northend zone of the subtropical area. In Belasitsa's short history around 1500 species of invertebrates and approximately 180 species of vertebrates have been discovered in the mountain including Bulgarian and Balkan endemytes. Some of the protected animals are white-backed woodpecker, black woodpecker, Orpheus warbler, and small olive tree Warbler.

It is typically measured as the amount of carbon dioxide that is fixed per metre squared per second, for example as Œºmol m‚àí2 sec‚àí1.  Limitations  Photosynthetic capacity is limited by carboxylation capacity and electron transport capacity. For example, in high carbon dioxide concentrations or in low light, the plant is not able to regenerate ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate fast enough (also known RUBP, the acceptor molecule in photosynthetic carbon reduction). So in this case, photosynthetic capacity is limited by electron transport of the light reaction, which generates the NADPH and ATP required for the PCR (Calvin) Cycle, and regeneration of RUBP. On the other hand, in low carbon dioxide concentrations, the capacity of the plant to perform carboxylation (adding carbon dioxide to Rubisco) is limited by the amount of available carbon dioxide, with plenty of Rubsico left over.¬π Light response, or photosynthesis- irradiance, curves display these relationships.  Current Research  Recent studies have shown that photosynthetic capacity in leaves can be increased with an increase in the number of stomata per leaf. This could be important in further crop development engineering to increase the photosynthetic efficiency through increasing diffusion of carbon dioxide into the plant.¬≤  References  * Hopkins, WIlliam G. and N.

Themes In the book, Hansen describes how the burning of fossil fuels is changing our climate and argues that this is putting Earth into imminent peril. He suggests that millions of species, and humanity itself, are threatened. The title of the book, Storms of My Grandchildren, refers to the ferocious and stormy weather events that will occur in the next generation if fossil fuel use continues in the way it has. In Hansen's evaluation, the response of politicians to this crisis has mainly been \\"greenwashing\\", where their proposals sound good but amount to little. Hansen says that we immediately need to cut back atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions such that atmospheric concentrations are stabilized at 350 ppm or less, in order to avoid environmental disasters for generations to come. He advocates prompt phaseout of coal plant emissions, plus improved forestry and agricultural practices. Hansen supports a carbon tax returned to citizens as a dividend and rejects cap and trade.

History and organization Pastor Terry Jones The Dove World Outreach Center was founded in 1985 by Donald O. Northrup, and his wife, Delores, Richard H. Wright was another early pastor. Northrup remained with Dove World from its inception until he died in 1996. Dennis Watson then took over as pastor, with Northrop's wife, Delores, continuing as Woman's Pastor until 2004. Between 2001 and 2008, Jones and his wife served as the part-time pastors of the Florida church, and as heads of a church in Cologne, Germany; by 2004 they were senior part-time pastors of Dove World, shuttling back and forth to Germany. Terry Jones assumed full-time duties at Dove World in 2008 after his German church was closed. Delores Northrup subsequently left Dove World, telling a reporter who contacted her regarding Jones' 2010 proposed Koran burning, \\"I was not happy with the program. I think this is completely wrong\\". In 2004, when Jones took over as senior pastor of Dove World, it had approximately 100 members; by September 2010 it was said to have 50 members, with about 30 members reportedly attending services. As of September 2010, Wayne Sapp was serving as assistant pastor, with Jones' son serving as youth minister. Terry Jones was invited to a rally in Luton in February 2011 to share his views on Islamic extremism. Anti-fascist group Hope not Hate successfully petitioned the Home Secretary to have Jones banned from entering the UK. German media reported on September 17, 2012 that Terry Jones would be barred from entering Germany if he traveled there. Jones was invited by the group Pro Deutschland to an event in Berlin. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry said that a visit by Jones would \\"run counter to the interest of maintaining public order.\\"German to Ban US Pastor Terry Jones From Entering Country, SPIEGEL.de; accessed February 4, 2016. Buildings and property In addition to the church, the Dove World Outreach Center maintained a school, called the \\"Dove World Outreach Academy\\". According to the Gainesville Sun, the academy had a bootcamp-like atmosphere. Students are prohibited from outside and family contact, including attendance at family weddings and funerals. They reportedly worked without compensation, selling, packing, and shipping furniture for TS and Company. Tuition for the six-month semester was $500. The church maintains a partial tax exemption for its non-profit activities, but has been assessed some $3,100 per year in property taxes for using a portion of its property to conduct a for-profit business, TS and Company. Jones told The New York Times in September 2010 that following his July 2010 announcement of the book-burning event, the bank, RBC (Royal Bank of Canada) which held a $140,000 mortgage loan on the church demanded immediate repayment of the balance and Jones had his property insurance canceled. In March 2013 it was reported that Dove World Outreach Center will relocate to the Tampa Bay area.\\"Controversial Gainesville pastor Doctor Terry Jones, known for burning Qurans, moving church to Bay area\\", wtsp.com; accessed February 4, 2016. Anti-gay and other activities The Dove World Outreach Center is considered a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, first making the list for its anti-gay activities. In March 2010, Dove World posted a video which decried the possibility of an openly gay mayor of Gainesville, and a lawn sign saying, \\"No Homo Mayor\\". The church changed the sign to simply read \\"No Homo\\" after Americans United requested the Internal Revenue Service to investigate the sign as an undue participation of a tax-exempt church in the political process. In April 2010 church members participated in a joint protest against homosexuality with the Westboro Baptist Church, a group known for disrupting the funerals of U.S. soldiers. Church member Fran Ingram posted an article on the church's website affirming the church's endorsements of the Westboro Baptist Church's protests against homosexuality but stated that \\"[w]e do not agree with all of Westboro's methods\\". =\\"No Homo Mayor\\" protest= Gainesville mayor Craig Lowe was subjected to a week-long fringe demonstration with signs reading \\"No Homo Mayor\\". During the mayoral run-off elections against Don Marsh, Lowe and his staff were harassed for their progressive views by pastor Wayne Sapp, with fliers, mailers and online slurs.Video: Pastor 'No Homo Mayor' Sapp Spews Hate against Out Florida Candidate, Bilerico.com; accessed February 4, 2016. Jones has also rallied against abortion in the past. Anti-Islam activities =Lawn signs and t-shirts= In 2009, Dove World posted a lawn sign which stated in large red letters \\"Islam is of the Devil\\", (and which later became the title of a book published by Jones in 2010). The signs drew protests and picketing by local activists and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). CAIR responded to another sign which read, \\"Koran 9:5 Kill the disbelievers wherever you find them.\\" Quran Surah At-Tawba ( Verse 5 ) saying the quote was out of context, and aimed at antagonizing Muslims. In August 2009, several children of church members went to their public schools wearing T-shirts reading \\"Islam is of the Devil\\" on the back and were sent home for violating the school district's dress code. The ACLU challenged the constitutionality of policies or practices which permit school administrators to ban any messages on clothing which they find ‚Äúoffensive to others‚Äù and which permit school administrators to allow messages which they determine to be ‚Äúpositive‚Äù while banning messages they determine to be ‚Äúnegative.‚ÄùWAYNE SAPP et al v. SCHOOL BOARD OF ALACHUA COUNTY, FLORIDA , aclufl.org; accessed September 1, 2017. According to the Dove World Outreach Center's web site the school is now permitting only plain or blank T-shirts to be worn by students. Legal experts said the policy was likely legal and did not violate the First Amendment. Jones said he had had the T-shirts printed by an internet company because local companies did not have the \\"guts\\" to print them. =2010 \\"International Burn a Koran Day\\"= Criticism Reactions were widespread ranging from the local level to the international and were largely negative. A sampling of these reactions follows. In August, 2010, Gainesville Mayor Lowe referred to Dove World as a \\"tiny fringe group and an embarrassment to our community\\". A Gainesville Interfaith Forum was established in opposition to Dove with participation from the University of Florida Hillel, Congregation Bnai Israel and individual Muslim residents. Twenty local religious leaders gathered Thursday, September 2, 2010, to call for citizens to rally around Muslims. The Gainesville Interfaith Forum's request for the declaration of September 11 as \\"Interfaith Solidarity Day\\" was honored by Gainesville Mayor Craig Lowe, and The Forum scheduled a \\"Gathering for Peace, Understanding and Hope\\" for the day before the planned burning. President Barack Obama called the planned burnings \\"a recruitment bonanza for Al Qaeda\\" that could result in serious violence against American troops. David Petraeus, U.S. forces general in Afghanistan, stated that it could endanger troops and the overall effort there and said \\"it is precisely the kind of action the Taliban uses and could cause significant problems.\\" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said \\"It is regrettable that a pastor in Gainesville, Florida, with a church of no more than 50 people, can make this outrageous and distrustful, disgraceful plan and get the world's attention\\". The U.S. embassy in Kabul issued a statement condemning the plans. Robert Gibbs, White House Press Secretary, criticized the plans stating \\"any type of activity like that that puts our troops in harm's way\\". NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that the church's plans would violate NATO's \\"values\\" and may have a negative impact on the security of its soldiers. Sarah Palin said the burning would \\"feed the fire of caustic rhetoric and appear as nothing more than mean- spirited religious intolerance\\". Other negative reaction and condemnation came from: the government of Canada, the Anti-Defamation League, Al-Azhar University, the National Association of Evangelicals, the German Evangelical Alliance, the International Humanist and Ethical Union, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, and many others. Protests Protests ensued against the proposed burning event: * On August 27, 2010, approximately 100 Indonesians protested outside the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta. * On September 4, 2010, Indonesians took to the streets to protest, with thousands, mostly Muslims, taking part in events across the country. Rokhmat Labib, chairman of the Islamic group Hizbut Tahrir that organized the protests, called the planned book burning a provocation and predicted that Muslims would fight back should it take place. Lahib said that Muslims must not stay silent when their faith is threatened. The Pluralism Care Movement, a multi-faith group asked for the U.S. government to prevent the burning and for Indonesia to show its tolerance for religious differences. * On September 6, 2010, hundreds of Afghans had protested in Kabul against the planned Qur'an burning event, chanting \\"death to America\\" and throwing rocks at a passing military convoy. Military officials also expressed fears that the protests would spread to other cities. Military officers at the Pentagon consequently said they hoped the rare incursion into politics by a military commander would convince pastor Jones to cancel his plans. Jones said, \\"We are sure that [General Petraeus'] concerns are legitimate. [Nonetheless] [w]e must send a clear message to the radical element of Islam. We will no longer be controlled and dominated by their fears and threats.\\" By September 12, 2010, three Afghans had been killed in protests over the Qur'an burning with incitement by the Taliban, anti- Afghan government, anti-American and anti-Jew sentiments contributing to the outrage, according to The New York Times. Outcome In the wake of international condemnation and personal threats, Jones said he would not \\"back down because of fear.\\" After canceling, then suspending the event in the days immediately preceding September 11, 2010, Jones ultimately said his church would not be carrying out the plan to burn the Korans and that he had attained the goal of exposing the fact that an element of Islam is \\"very dangerous and very radical\\". At a press conference Jones said that he planned to move the church to St. Petersburg, Florida as soon as the Gainesville property was sold. An article dated April 2, 2011 indicates that a recent burning of a Muslim holy book at Dove World Outreach has fueled a second day of deadly violence half a world away in Afghanistan, where demonstrators set cars and shops ablaze Saturday in a riot that killed nine protesters, officials said. Jones said he backed out of the burning because Imam Muhammad Musri deceived him by saying that the proposed ground zero mosque would be relocated. =2011 \\"International Judge the Quran Day\\"= After the pressure over the \\"Burn the Qu'ran\\" controversy had died down, Jones established a new organization, \\"Stand Up America Now\\".http://www.standupamericanow.org/ On March 20, 2011, Jones officiated as judge over a mock trial operated by Stand Up America Now in which the Qu'ran was found \\"guilty\\" of a variety of crimes, including \\"murder, rape, deception, being responsible for terrorist activities all around the world\\"; over 30 people attended the event, including Ahmed Abaza and other converts from Islam to Christianity testifying against the book and Sheikh Imam Mohammed Hassan, a former candidate in the Sudanese presidential election, 2010 and current Texas-based Sunni cleric, serving as \\"defense attorney\\". A copy was then burned on a barbecue grill by Wayne Sapp. Response At first, the response was minor compared to the previous September's \\"Burn the Qu'ran\\" episode. Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said that \\"Terry Jones had his 15 minutes of fame and we're not going to help him get another few minutes.\\" Later, protests erupted in Pakistan where the Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Islam organized a road blockage and burnings of effigies and American flags in the province of Sindh and mobs proceeded to protest against the Punjab neighborhoods of Pakistani Christians. The leader of the Jamaat-ud-Dawah, Amir Hamza, announced a Rs 10 crore bounty for Jones' murder. The Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammad Khazaee, condemned the burning and called for Jones' prosecution. On April 1, 2011 a mob, inflamed by a mosque sermon describing the burning of the Muslim holy book, attacked a United Nations compound in a northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif in Afghanistan. A mob of 1000 angry people attacked a U.N. compound. The attack resulted in the killing of Nepalese guards. According to Sherjan Durrani, a spokesman for the provincial police ‚Äúfour rioters had also been killed and that more than 100 others were injured in the outbreak of violence in the northern city, normally one of the calmer corners of Afghanistan.‚Äù President Obama strongly condemned both the Quran burning, calling it an act of \\"extreme intolerance and bigotry\\", as well as the \\"outrageous\\" attacks by protesters, referring to them as \\"an affront to human decency and dignity ... No religion tolerates the slaughter and beheading of innocent people, and there is no justification for such a dishonorable and deplorable act.\\"Obama condemns Quran burning ‚Äòbigotry‚Äô , Dawn, April 3, 2011 U.S. legislators, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, also condemned both the burning and the violence in reaction to it.US Legislators Condemn Quran Burning, Violent Reaction, Voice of America, April 3, 2011. Worldwide burning of the Koran and images of the prophet Mohammed: 2012 On February 24, 2012, Pastor Terry Jones released a video on YouTube on which he demanded the Iranian government release a pastor by the name of Youcef Nadarkhani from prison. Nadarkhani is a pastor who had been found guilty for apostasy from Islam, when he left Islam at the age of 19 and converted to Christianity. The Iranian government had used sharia law to sentence Nadarkhani to be executed for apostasy unless he recanted his conversion to Christianity. =2012 International Judge Mohammed Day= On September 11, 2012, on the 11-year anniversary of the 9/11 attack, Jones held an event called 'International Judge Mohammed day'. On this day, Jones put the Islamic prophet Mohammed on trial on charges such as rape, being a false prophet and being responsible for the murder of millions of Non-Muslims and minorities. Mohammed was found guilty and Jones proceeded with a burning of a Mohammed action figure and the Koran as well. As part of the event, Jones promoted a low-budget film critical of Mohammed called 'The Innocence of Muslims'. The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt have put out an arrest warrant for seven Copt Christians in Canada and America for their alleged involvement in the making of the film, which also led to worldwide riots by Muslims.

Method In the preparation phase, the plunger, guide bar and guide disk are pushed forward by the compression spring. At the end of the movement the hammer mass is hooked by the pawl. During the loading phase the hammer is pushed towards the surface in a controlled movement. The hammer mass remains locked in place by the pawl. This has the effect of stretching the impact spring to put it under tension. Impact Rebound: At the very end of the movement, the pawl spring releases the hammer mass. The impact spring contracts causing the hammer mass to strike against the plunger. This is the impact. The hammer mass then rebounds back to the body of the hammer and distance travelled is recorded on the scale. The rebound distance depends directly on the hardness of the roll under test: A softer roll will absorb more of the impact energy and the rebound distance will be less. A harder roll will reflect more of the impact energy and the rebound distance will increase.

The name refers to their flat, tabular summits composed of hard Corallian limestone known locally as \\"nabs\\". They form the northern boundary of the Vale of Pickering. Description Steep-sided river valleys break through the Tabular Hills to form a broken series of tablet-shaped hills. The most distinctive feature of these is their northern escarpment, which rises to above the moorland to the north. At their western end, beyond the River Rye, they join with the north- south Hambleton Hills, which have a similar geological basis. Striking among the river valleys are Newton Dale and Forge Valley ‚Äì glacial run-off channels formed by massive melt water denied an exit to the North Sea by glacial ice, pouring over the lowest points in the landscape during the last ice age and cutting steeply sided channels. The Hole of Horcum is a scallop-shaped valley formed by the action of a line of springs.

As such, the WACOM project primarily deals with initial and continuing vocational education and training (VET) in the European Union. This model was established through the EQF in combination with the German Reference Model for Competence Modeling PAS 1093.  Overview  Due to the shortage of the precious resource water and the consequences of the climate change, numerous European policies have been developed and adopted for the protection and sustainable utilisation of water, creating a huge demand in vocational training.Water supply and sanitation in the European Union Economic factors like privatisation and increasing cost pressure in water management are further increasing these educational needs, leading to the demand for VET opportunities and products that are as short and tailor‚Äêmade as possible. The situation of vocational training in water management was addressed by the WACOM instrument, which attempted to define the needed competences and qualifications for the different tasks, working places and employees within the water sector. In this way, WACOM strove to lead to a supposed increase in the volume of mobility throughout Europe as well as to a higher transparency and recognition of qualifications and competences. The project aimed at creating general as well as particular modular VET opportunities and products in the water management concerning the addressed competences and qualifications. Through this, the VET opportunities and products were able to be related and mapped to those competences and qualifications for the management of sewage treatment plants. In addition, the competence and qualification model offers the basis for the individual identification of missing competences and qualifications, i.e. of clearly limited VET needs. WACOM also supported the European comparability and recognition of vocational training through the combination with credit points (ECVET) and thus mobility. Next to numerous dissemination activities, WACOM looked in particular for input into the national VET systems and for launching a European Norm initiative as contribution to the European standardisation (CEN). Furthermore, the transfer into other sectors and all European countries was carried out through a focus on pilot‚Äêtesting, optimization, dissemination, exploitation and sustainable strategies.  WACOM Main Objectives  The overall objective of WACOM was the development and transfer of a reference model for competence modelling into the water sector of the partner countries, enabling the identification of the VET needs by the employees and learners of required competences and qualifications at specific working places as well as of the improvement of transparency and comparability of VET opportunities and products. \\\\- To support participants in training and further training activities in the acquisition and the use of knowledge, skills and qualifications to facilitate personal development \\\\- To support improvements in quality and innovation in vocational education and training systems, institutions and practices \\\\- To enhance the attractiveness of vocational education and training and mobility for employers and individuals and to facilitate the mobility of working traineesWACOM Project Website ()  Brief description of the WACOM products  The development of the WACOM instrument was supported by the transfer of the competence and qualification model into the water sector and by the adaptation for the selected topic management of sewage treatment plants. WACOM influences vocational training in water management and in additional sectors. The main WACOM products and affects were: 1\\\\. \\"Competence model for the water sector\\" Development of WACOM (the WAter COmpetences Model) as the establishment of a competence model for the water sector based on EQF and PAS 1093: the aim was the foundation of the vocational training on the principle of competence modelling based on the identification of the specific demands and needs of the water management and existing practice concerning competence models in the water sector. The experiences gained through the testing of this model aid the plans of other European research projects which also use competence models, such as the Agricom Project or the Compat.egov Project. 2\\\\. \\"WACOM instrument\\" Optimization and adaptation of WACOM (the WAter COmpetences Model) to the vocational education and training systems and cultures in Europe. Finally the WACOM instrument was used for the description of the competences and qualifications and for the improvement of their transparency and comparability.  End-of-Project Conferences  Two conferences were carried out in order to open the results of the WACOM project for discussion to a larger audience, the 4th European Conference \\"Innovations in the Environmental Sector\\" (INES) and the European Conference \\"Competence Modelling for the Water Sector\\", both of which took place in Brussels, Belgium on 21 September 2011.

Biography Moore was born in Co.Monaghan Ireland. He is the owner of Michelin starred restaurants Pied √† Terre, situated on London's Charlotte Street in an area called Fitzrovia, and L'Autre Pied in the fashionable Marylebone in London's West End. He is a non executive director of award- winning Van Zeller restaurant and of the One Sixty smokehouse restaurants. Van Zeller is in Harrogate in North Yorkshire, in England and is run by head chef Tom van ZellerBBC \\"Meet David Moore\\" The BBC Retrieved on 03-08-2010. whilst One City has venues in West Hampstead and in the City of London. After achieving his Higher National Diploma in Hotel, Catering and Institutional Management (HCIMA), Moore seized the opportunity to do a work experience in the highly regarded The Box Tree, Ilkley in 1985 when the restaurant was of two Michelin Star status. In 1986, he took a position in Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons, Great Milton, Oxon working alongside world-renowned chef Raymond Blanc. It is here where Moore learned more about the high end Michelin Star dining trade.\\"The Spectator\\" 2009 Moore also worked for a stint in Le Louis XV restaurant in Monte Carlo's Hotel de Paris. In 1991, Moore opened his first French fine-dining restaurant, Pied √† Terre on Charlotte Street in London's West End. Pied √† Terre was an instant success, gaining Michelin star status just thirteen months after opening, and in January 1996 the second Michelin star was achieved. These two stars were retained until 1999. Asimakis Chaniotis is the head chef at Pied √† Terre and gained his first Michelin star at the age of just 28. Chaniotis runs the Pied √† Terre kitchen and heads up the fantastic team, producing creative and exciting food that continues to delight both diners and critics alike. In November 2004, a fire forced the closure of the restaurant for most of 2005 but Moore insisted it was immediately rebuilt, redecorated and resurrected back to life to re-open on September 26, 2005. With Moore as part-owner, Pied √† Terre has achieved many more awards including: Four Red Rosettes AA, 8/10 in the Good Food Guide, 29/30 in the Zagat ‚ÄòReaders Choice‚Äô and Best Restaurant in the World 2007 as voted in the Top 50 Restauant Magazine. Also it was voted Number 4 in UK Top One Hundred Restaurants in 2008. More recently, Pied √† Terre's wine list has been awarded third place in the 2015 Hardens/Sunday Times list of restaurants in the UK. 2007 saw the opening of Moore's second restaurant L'Autre Pied, in the fashionable Marylebone, London. L'Autre Pied is a one star Michelin restaurant which, like its big brother, also specialises in French-style cuisine, in a relaxed environment. Moore can often be seen front of house in both Pied √† Terre and L'Autre Pied where he is known for his meticulous attention to detail. In keeping with the Pied tradition which sees head chefs nurture and mentor rising stars in the industry, Graham Long once worked under previous chef Shane Osborn and has now returned to the fold as head chef taking over from Andy McFadden who has moved over to Pied √† Terre. Moore took on his first non-executive director's role in 2008 with the opening of Van Zeller in Harrogate, the creation of chef Tom van Zeller which has gone on to win a selection of awards including The Good Food Guide Restaurant of the Year 2013. In October 2013 Moore opened his first pop-restaurant, Pieds Nus, just a stone's throw away from L'Autre Pied. The restaurant was around until April 2014 and is won many followers for its simple dishes best shared. In the short time it was open, it received rave reviews from The Telegraph, Hello Magazine, The Evening Standard and many more. David Moore is also founding partner of the London Cocktail Club, which has gone on to open 6 bars across London. Since 2013, he is also a backer of the Treboom Brewery, as well as a trustee of Cockpit Arts. David Moore has made several TV appearances including BBC MasterChef: The Professionals and BBC Out of the Frying Pan, both of which aired in summer 2010. He is most likely to be remembered as an inspector on BBC The Restaurant, series 2 and 3, alongside his former mentor Raymond Blanc and fellow inspector Sarah Willingham.

Origin The overall accepted origin for the female name Brenda is the Old Nordic male name Brandr meaning both torch and sword: evidently the male name Brandr took root in areas of the British Isles under Nordic dominance and through being heard as '\\"Brenda\\" was eventually adopted as a female name. The name Brenda was probably influenced by the iconic Gaelic male name Brendan: although linguistically it is unlikely that the name Brendan would yield the name Brenda as its feminine form, the name Brenda is widely considered a feminine form of the name Brendan in Ireland, Scotland and Wales. History =The British Isles= Occurring in the medieval legend of Madoc - the purported son of the 12th century historical Welsh ruler Owain Gwynedd by Brenda the daughter of a Viking overlord in Ireland \\\\- the name Brenda was apparently until the 19th century confined to the Northern Isles being an evident remnant of the Northern Isles' Norse rule from 875 to 1470. The name's utilization by Sir Walter Scott for the heroine of his 1821 novel The Pirate - set in Orkney - is credited with bringing the name Brenda into general usage throughout the British Isles although the initial appearance of The Pirate generated no evident vogue for the name Brenda, and while the Late Victorian children's author Georgina Castle Smith, first published in 1873, made the name Brenda well-known via Castle Smith using Brenda as her mononymous pseudonym (as suggested by her mother for no known reason), actual significant usage of the name in the British Isles is only in evidence from the early 20th century with the name Brenda ranking for the first time as a top 100 name for newborn girls in England and Wales in the 1920s (e.g. #58 in 1924). The first evident celebrity to be named Brenda was \\"bright young thing\\" extraordinaire Brenda Dean Paul whose \\"party girl\\" career afforded her a high society press profile from the mid-1920s: she was a member of the same social circle as writer Evelyn Waugh who gave the first name Brenda to a \\"bright young thing\\" who was a major character in Waugh's 1934 novel A Handful of Dust, a rare example of the name Brenda occurring in highbrow literature. From 1931 media attention on Brenda Dean Paul was focused on her substance addictions and legal woes: \\"in and out of rehab and court... she became a tabloid fixture that the public loved to hate.\\" However, the negative associations of such tabloid press headlines as \\"Brenda Jailed Again\\" had no evident adverse effect on usage of the name Brenda in the British Isles of the 1930s, that decade affording the name Brenda its peak usage in England and Wales (e.g. #16 in 1934): still popular in the 1940s (e.g. #22 in 1944) the name Brenda had in 1954 dropped to #52 on the tally of the 100 most popular girls names for newborns in England and Wales with the name being absent on the respective tallies by 1964. In 2013, the name Brenda according to the ONS was given to a total of six newborn girls in England in 2013. In Scotland the name Brenda was first heavily used in the 1940s: ranked at #47 on the tally of the most popular names for newborn girls in Scotland for the year 1950, the name Brenda remained popular in Scotland until the 1970s when its popularity took a steep drop: in 2014, 14 newborn girls in Scotland were registered as being named Brenda. According to the CSO the name Brenda, which in 1964 had been #63 on the tally for names given newborn girls in Ireland, was not given to any newborn girls in Ireland in 2014. In 1971, the UK satirical magazine Private Eye ran a pseudo-item that Queen Elizabeth II \\"is known as Brenda to her immediate staff\\" resulting in the name Brenda being used in the media as an irreverent nickname for the Queen. A cross-dressed impersonation of the Queen was a standard routine of comedian Stanley Baxter who never identified his character as a parody of the Queen instead calling \\"herself\\" the Duchess of Brenda. =The United States= In the US the name Brenda was first afforded a high-profile in the mid-1930s, as the press began charting the \\"career\\" of \\"celebutante\\" Brenda Frazier. Named for her mother, whose own father Frederick Williams-Taylor was the son of Irish emigrants to Canada, Brenda Frazier had first been mentioned in the press as a pre-teen due to her parents' 1925‚Äì26 high-profile divorce and subsequent parental custody battle over Frazier, whose first name of Brenda, consequently, began appearing in the annual tally of the Top 1000 most popular names for newborn American girls from 1925, when it was ranked at #977. As Brenda Frazier's name began appearing in the society pages when she was a teenager in the mid-1930s the name Brenda began rising in the yearly tallies for the top names given newborn American girls: ranked at #423 in the respective tally for the year 1937 the name Brenda was ranked at #241 on the respective tally for 1938, the year of Frazier's coming-out ball, held following months of avid publicity. The full-force of Frazier's 27 December 1938 coming-out ball ‚Äî which generated headlines f√™ting her as \\"the debutante of the century\\" ‚Äî was evident when the name Brenda appeared for the first time among the Top 100 names for newborn American girls ‚Äî at #86 ‚Äî in the tally for the subsequent year 1939, with the cachet with which Frazier imbued the name Brenda evidenced by two Hollywood movie studios conferring the name on their respective 1939 \\"discoveries\\": Brenda JoyceThe Ogden Standard-Examiner 24 September 24, 1939 p. 12 and Brenda Marshall (although neither actress would herself generate significant star-power). It was also on account of Brenda Frazier that cartoonist Dale Messick utilized \\"Brenda\\" as the first name for the heroine of the comic strip Brenda Starr, Reporter which debuted 30 June 1940; Messick would state in a 1986 interview that prior to Brenda Frazier becoming a society page staple \\"I had never heard the name Brenda\\". Although Brenda Frazier's own vogue soon ebbed, the initial popularity she'd afforded the name Brenda was evidently reinforced by the success of Brenda Starr, Reporter: ranked as the #42 most popular name for American newborn girls as tallied for the year 1940, the name Brenda accrued favor so as to rank at #21 on the respective tally for 1948 with a subsequent 17-year tenure in the Top 20, with its strongest showing #11 on the tally for the year 1961 the year singer Brenda Lee had her career peak. Last ranked in the Top 50 of the most popular names for American newborn girls in the tally for 1972 ‚Äî at #44 ‚Äî the name Brenda made its last Top 100 ranking to date ‚Äî at #91 ‚Äî on the respective tally for the year 1977.

History In the first half of the 20th century, the Orthodox Albanian communities in America were loosely affiliated with one another, with six of fifteen communities claiming \\"independent\\" status and the others not incorporated as dioceses until after the Second World War. The earliest organized Albanian dioceses were set up under the auspices of the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church (now Orthodox Church in America), because the Church of Constantinople would not allow the rise of any Albanian Orthodox Church and officially opposed the use of the Albanian language in churches until 1937 when the Autocephalic Orthodox Church of Albania was recognized by Constantinople. These early Albanian dioceses in America were led by Fan S. Noli, and in 1908 a translation of the liturgy into Albanian was made. After political dislocations following the October Revolution of 1917 in Russia, all ties with the Russian Orthodox church were severed, and the Albanian churches under Noli became independent. In the 1920s Noli was exiled to Germany, returning in 1932. His return reopened the discussion of the need for a canonical Albanian diocese in North America; Noli had been consecrated in 1922 as Bishop of Durr√´s by the Church of Albania, which did not claim any jurisdiction in North America, so he could not gain recognition as head of a diocese in the Americas. =Dioceses= With the controversy around Bp. Theofan's status, the end of World War II, and the increasing suppression and manipulation of the Church of Albania by the new Communist government, a significant portion of Orthodox Albanian-Americans petitioned the Patriarch of Constantinople, Athenagoras, to send a canonical bishop. Mark (Lipa) organized the Diocese in 1950 and accepted into it the large community in Chicago and an older parish, the first of three Albanian Orthodox parishes to locate in South Boston. Ten other Albanian Orthodox parishes incorporated under Bp. Theofan's Archdiocese and two parishes persisted in an \\"independent\\" status. In 1965 at the passing of Bp. Theofan, without an Archdiocesan nomination and under the cloud of Communist influence, the Church of Albania consecrated his successor, Bp. , who was not accepted throughout the Archdiocese and who likewise could not gain canonical recognition by the other Orthodox jurisdictions in North America. The situation was further irritated by the complete public suppression of all religious communities in Albania, with only the most stalwart Orthodox believers maintaining a clandestine liturgical life. Bp. Mark and the Albanian Orthodox Diocese of America reasserted their status as the lone canonical Albanian Orthodox jurisdiction in the Americas. By October 1971, with the acceptance of Bp. Stephen and the Albanian Orthodox Archdiocese in America as a constituent diocese of the OCA, the canonical controversy was ended. =Legacy= The Albanian Orthodox Diocese of America played a crucial role in the resurrection of the Church of Albania. In 1990, the Diocesan clergy and laity petitioned the Ecumenical Patriarch, Demetrios, during his visit to North America, to prepare a plan for the restoration of the Church of Albania. In 1991, the (then) Protopresbyter Ilia Katre, who had served for many years as Dean of Students at Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology in Brookline, MA, took up residence in Albania, organized and opened the Resurrection of Christ Seminary with the blessing of the newly arrived Patriarchal Exarch, Anastasios. Ilia also directed the enthronement of Anastasios as Archbishop of All Albania in August 1992. Individuals and delegations from the Diocese made major financial contributions to the Church of Albania as well as applied pressure on the government for the return of confiscated property to the Church. In 2002 Bishop Ilia returned to lead the Seminary for three years during which he expanded, strengthened, and lengthened the course to a full four-year programme. The Diocese has made outreach to new communities in Toronto, Montreal, Washington, and Baltimore.

The \\"Road to\\" episodes which have aired throughout various seasons of Family Guy were inspired by the Road to... comedy films starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour, though this episode was not originally conceived as a \\"Road to\\" show. The episode is the second Family Guy Christmas special after the season three episode, \\"A Very Special Family Guy Freakin' Christmas\\", also written by Danny Smith. It was first announced at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International. Critical responses to the episode were mostly positive; critics praised its storyline and its numerous cultural references, although it also received criticism from the Parents Television Council. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 8.03 million homes during its original airing in the United States. The episode featured guest performances by Drew Barrymore, H. Jon Benjamin, David Boreanaz, Carrie Fisher, and Karley Scott Collins, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. It is narrated by Ron MacFarlane, Seth MacFarlane's father. It was nominated for 3 Emmy Awards: Outstanding Music Composition for a Series, Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (Half-Hour) and Animation. It later won for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (Half-Hour) and Animation. The song \\"Christmastime Is Killing Us\\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media. Plot Brian takes Stewie to the mall, only to get a rude brush-off from the Santa who works there when he leaves for the night. As a result, Stewie vows to kill Santa for blowing him off and forces Brian to take him to the North Pole. Attempting to trick Stewie, he brings him to a Santa's Village amusement park. Soon discovering the charade, Stewie threatens to shoot Brian if he does not take him to the real North Pole. Stewie hitches a ride with a trucker and so Brian follows him all the way to Canada. On the way, Stewie accidentally causes a traffic pileup by discharging a flare pistol in the cab of the truck, which catches fire and explodes. Crashing his car in a chain reaction, Brian becomes angry and tells Stewie that Santa does not exist. Stewie becomes frustrated and continues to attempt to hitchhike, coercing Brian to join him. The pair then encounter a Canadian who gives them his snowmobile. Continuing north, they soon run out of gas, but receive help from the Aurora Boreanaz, who instructs them to stay at a nearby cabin. The two survive the night in the cabin and set out on foot the next morning. They finally make it to Santa's workshop, only to find a dark, gloomy factory in a dreary, polluted, lifeless wasteland; Santa is a sickly and depressed old man, the elves are all horribly mutated and inbred due to Santa's attempts to keep up with the increasing gift demands year after year, and the reindeer are carnivorous, feral monsters that eat the elves who wander out into the snow to die of exhaustion. Santa suddenly collapses and is too sick to deliver the presents. Brian and Stewie agree to do it, but end up wasting an hour and a half at their first house after their presence is discovered by a family whom they attack, bind and gag with duct tape, upon discovering they were in the wrong house. Realizing that they will not be able to complete the delivery in time, and understanding firsthand the impossibility of Santa's job, Stewie and Brian abandon the delivery in lieu of another plan. On Christmas morning, everybody wakes up without any presents under their trees. They turn on the news, which is broadcasting the same story. Brian and Stewie appear on the broadcast and bring the dying Santa out in a wheelchair, explaining that humanity's greed is killing him and if they don't shorten their demands to one Christmas present a year, they may have to give up Christmas altogether. Chastened, everyone agrees and by one year later, Santa has recovered, the workshop is once again a lively, colorful cottage and the elves and reindeer are all rejuvenated. Production and development \\"Road to the North Pole\\" is the sixth episode of the \\"Road to\\" episodes of the series which air through various seasons of the show. It was directed by Family Guy veteran Greg Colton, this being the first episode he has directed since the eighth season episode \\"Go Stewie, Go.\\" This is also Colton's third \\"Road to\\" episode, the first being \\"Road to Germany\\" and the second being \\"Road to the Multiverse.\\" The episode was written by Chris Sheridan and Danny Smith, this being the first Smith wrote since \\"Partial Terms of Endearment,\\" and his first \\"Road to\\" episode. It included staff writers Alex Carter, Andrew Goldberg and Elaine Ko. It is an hour-long special with three musical numbers. Ron MacFarlane, Seth MacFarlane's father, served as the episode's narrator. This is also the first \\"Road to\\" episode to be composed by Ron Jones. Two of the musical numbers, \\"All I Really Want for Christmas\\" and \\"Christmastime is Killing Us\\" were released as digital downloads on iTunes. \\"Christmastime is Killing Us\\" was available on December 3, 2010, while \\"All I Really Want for Christmas\\" was made available on December 10, 2010. In addition to the regular cast, the episode also guest starred actress Drew Barrymore, voice actor H. Jon Benjamin, actor David Boreanaz, actress Karley Scott Collins, actress Carrie Fisher, actor Ron MacFarlane, father of series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, actor Bruce McGill, voice actor Will Ryan, voice actress Tara Strong and actress Nana Visitor. Recurring guest voice actors John G. Brennan, actor Chris Cox, actor Ralph Garman, writer Chris Sheridan, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin, actress Jennifer Tilly, writer J. Lee, and writer John Viener also made minor appearances. Cultural references This episode as well as the entire \\"Road to\\" series in Family Guy is a parody of the seven Road to... comedy films which were released from 1940 to 1962, starring actors Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and actress Dorothy Lamour. The opening credits show images with Brian and Stewie referencing other Christmas specials such as The Nutcracker, A Christmas Carol, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Frosty the Snowman and Home Alone. The credits also show Brian and Stewie performing winter activities, such as snowball fights, making snow angels and putting coal in the (Meg's) Christmas socks instead of gifts. Ron MacFarlane, who narrated part of the episode, mentioned that Kenny Rogers was supposed to be there. The episode opens with a musical number in which the members of Quahog sing about what they want for Christmas. Peter wishes to have actress and models Jessica Biel and Megan Fox. He also wishes to have lunch with Michael Landon's ghost and wants twelve kegs of beer. Lois wishes to visit the Spanish coasts, and \\"Mexico, with two black guys and some blow\\". Chris wishes for Jennifer Garner and Meg wishes for a Lexus. The neighbors of Quahog also wish for gifts: Herbert wishes for a drummer boy (there is a picture of singer Nick Jonas on the wall while he wishes for this), Mayor Adam West wishes for a tinkertoy, Carl wishes for a Blu-ray version of The Wiz and Consuela wishes for more Lemon Pledge. Continuing with the song, Jillian Russell wishes for Easter eggs, Joe wishes for one day when kids don't stare at him, Bonnie wants platinum-plated silverware, Quagmire wants \\"Japanese girls of no restraint\\" to choke him and then whip him and Mort (who is Jewish) says he will sue if they put a Christmas tree in the airport. The song ends with various characters appearing in an advent calendar. Brian and Stewie go to the mall so they can meet Santa, but Peter is asking Santa for gifts (he asks for a game of Uno, a Magna Doodle, a pet chink (a mix of a chinchilla and a mink) and a Charles in Charge lunchbox.) When the mall Santa leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie sit in his lap, Santa mentions he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that Santa leaving before he got a chance to sit in his lap felt like a bigger betrayal than the betrayal of Gary Busey by reality; this takes us to Busey looking himself in the mirror asking his reflection, in the form of a crazed clown, how he is doing. Brian and Stewie decide to go to the North Pole to kill Santa, but Brian does not want Stewie to get disappointed if Santa is not what everybody thinks he is; to this Stewie responds that Brian is as negative as Eeyore from Winnie-the-Pooh. To prevent Stewie from going to the North Pole he tells him that Santa is not real; Stewie questions this, also asking if Elmo, SpongeBob SquarePants and Curious George aren't real. On their way to the North Pole, Brian and Stewie find themselves in Canada, where they meet a man with a thick Canadian accent; they also see the Aurora borealis and the Aurora Boreanaz (an aurora with David Boreanaz's face). When they finally get to the North Pole and find it polluted and lifeless, Stewie compares it to Bridgeport, Connecticut; thus resulting in a cutaway to a Bridgeport resident writing an angry letter to the Family Guy writer staff about Stewie's comment. When Santa Claus is near death, he shocks Stewie by saying \\"I'll be with Allah soon\\". When Brian and Stewie decide to deliver the presents for Santa, in their travel the Statue of Liberty can be seen. Unfortunately, they are not able to deliver the presents, and the next morning the residents of Quahog are upset because they have no presents, but Mort says he got eight mediocre gifts. Reception \\"Road to the North Pole\\" was broadcast on December 12, 2010, as a part of an animated television night on Fox, and was preceded by The Simpsons, and followed by Family Guy creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane's second show, American Dad!. It was watched by 8.03 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, despite airing simultaneously with the Desperate Housewives on ABC, The Amazing Race and Undercover Boss on CBS and Sunday Night Football on NBC. The episode also acquired a 3.9 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, beating American Dad! and The Simpsons in addition to significantly edging out both shows in total viewership. The episode's ratings increased significantly from the previous week's episode. This episode received generally positive response from critics. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave \\"Road to the North Pole\\" a positive review, stating that it is \\"a satisfying episode of Family Guy all around, filled with funny gags and nice moments.\\" She especially praised the musical segments, and the portrayal of the North Pole, writing that \\"the way the episode kept piling more and more ridiculous horrors on top of each other kept the whole thing funny.\\" She rated the episode an \\"A-\\". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also praised the songs and the depiction of Santa's factory, though he found the delivery of the episode's message \\"heavy-handed.\\" Kate Moon of TV Fanatic gave the episode 3.6 out of 5 stars. She said, \\"I had mixed feelings about this one, despite its clever moments and hopeful ending. While I normally have no problems about Family Guys shocking or offensive themes, I felt bit disconcerted about the direction of this Christmas episode.\\" She went on to say, \\"Perhaps it was the way that the series stomped on something as innocent as Santa and his elves and twisted them all around. Or perhaps it was the cannibalistic reindeer. Whatever the specific reason, the irreverent nature of Family Guy seemed just a little too graphic for me this time around.\\" Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number twelve on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of \\"yukyukyuks\\" and described the episode as \\"Christmas comedy gold\\", praising the 'Christmastime is Killing Us' song and Boreanaz's cameo. The Parents Television Council, a conservative campaigning critic of Seth MacFarlane works, named Family Guy its \\"Worst TV Show of the Week\\" for \\"Road to the North Pole\\" for the week ending on December 17, 2010\\\\. It got this rating due to sexual content and excessive violent scenes including the scene in which Stewie beats a man to death with a baseball bat, and the scenes featuring Seth MacFarlane's father, Ron, while also stating, \\"Forget naughty or nice. This show was simply nauseating.\\" Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave \\"Road to the North Pole\\" a 47 out of a possible 100, said \\"A little more interesting plot wise than the usual fare but otherwise just as gruesome\\". He especially disliked the portrayal of Santa and his elves and the violence. The episode was also nominated for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics (for song \\"Christmastime Is Killing Us\\", written by Ron Jones, Seth MacFarlane, and Danny Smith) and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (Half- Hour) and Animation. It won for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (Half-Hour) and Animation. The series was successfully nominated in 2009, but failed to merit an award. Mark Hentemann, executive producer and showrunner of Family Guy said of the nominating process, \\"We had internal discussions in the writers' room, and it seemed like we were much more akin to the other primetime comedies than we were to children's shows in animation. We assumed we would not get anywhere, and so it was a great surprise when we got the nomination.\\" \\"Christmastime Is Killing Us\\" was nominated for Best Song Written for a Visual Media at the 54th Grammy Awards.

It is derived from the Gaelic name Breand√°n, which is in turn derived from the earlier Old Irish Br√©nainn. The Old Welsh breenhin is the root of the name, meaning Prince or King. The mediaeval Latin form of the name, Brendanus, has also influenced the modern English and Irish forms. Variant spellings of Brendan are Brendon and Brenden. In some cases it is possible that the given name Brandon is also a variant of Brendan. A variant spelling of the Irish Breand√°n is Breannd√°n. Etymology The English Brendan is an Anglicised form of the Irish Breand√°n. This Irish name is derived from the Old Irish Br√©nainn. This Old Irish personal name, (pronounced [br'ƒìn-in'], is derived from a borrowing of the Welsh language word breenh√≠n, meaning \\"a prince\\". Both the English form, Brendan, and the modern Irish form, Breand√°n, are based upon the mediaeval Latin form Brendanus. According to one old Irish text there are 17 saints with the name. When used in an Irish sentence it can take the form Bhreand√°n e.g. A Bhreand√°n or ..do Bhreand√°n. Variation of the Irish Breand√°n are Breannd√°n, Bhreand√°n and Bhreand√°in. There is no etymological link between Brendan and Brenda. This feminine given name, pronounced , which cited: is thought to be derived from the Old Norse element brand, meaning \\"(flaming) sword\\". In most cases, the masculine given name Brandon, pronounced , which cited: is considered to be derived from the surname Brandon, which is in turn derived from two Old English elements. =Variants, cognates= *English - Brandon (in some cases), Brendon *Irish - Breand√°n, Breannd√°n *Latin - Brendanus *Old Irish - Br√©nainn Popularity and use In some cases, the masculine given name Brennan may be used as a contracted form of Brendan. Brennan is etymologically unrelated to Brendan. It is derived from the surname Brennan, which is an Anglicised form of the Irish √ì Braon√°in. The popularity of (forms of) Brendan in Gaelic-speaking countries is thought to have influenced the use and popularity of the etymologically unrelated feminine name Brenda.

The army of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth under John III Sobieski, totaling around 9,000 men defeated Tatar and Cossack forces under Petro Doroshenko and Adil Giray, which totaled around 35,000 men.  Prelude to battle  On January 31, 1667 the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Tsardom of Russia signed the Treaty of Andrusovo. Russia gained the control of Left-bank Ukraine, while the commonwealth maintained the rule of Right-bank Ukraine, which would be defended by Polish-Lithuanian and Russian forces. The end of the war gave time to commonwealth armies for reinforcement. At the same period Petro Doroshenko, Hetman of Right-bank Ukraine, in order to establish his rule in Right-bank Ukraine signed a treaty with Sultan Mehmed IV that recognized the Cossack Hetmanate as a vassal of the Ottoman Empire. To further increase his military strength Doroshenko allied with Adil Giray, the khan of the Crimean Khanate. After gathering 15,000 Cossacks, about 18,000 Tatars, and 3,000 Janissaries sent by the Ottoman Empire to support the Cossacks, Doroshenko attacked the area of Podhajce in western Ukraine. Polish-Lithuanian forces under John III Sobieski, made up mostly of armed villagers, orthodox Galician Ruthenians who remained loyal to Polish kings since the beginning of Chmelnitsky's uprising, encamped themselves on the southern part of Podhajce in order to gain a strategic advantage against the army of Doroshenko. On October 4, 1667 the Cossack-Tatar forces, supported by Jannisaries arrived in Podhajce.  Battle  On October 6, 1667 Tatar forces under Adil Giray attacked the Polish-Lithuanian army. The Polish-Lithuanian infantry, supported by Polish multiple guns, defeated the Tatars and counterattacked. On the following days Cossack, Tatar and Janissary troops unsuccessfully tried to circumvent the right wing of the Polish-Lithuanian army, and flank attack the left wing of the troops of the Commonwealth. Sobieski sent forces on the left wing of the army, and outnumbered the Cossack-Tatar forces, which were defeated. After the failure of consecutive attacked, Doroshenko unsuccessfully besieged the town of Podhajce, which was defended by Jan Sobieski. In the middle of October, 1667 Sobieski and Doroshenko signed an armistice and the Cossack-Tatar army retreated from Podhajce.  Aftermath  After defeating Doroshenko in Podhajce, John III Sobieski was promoted to commander-in-chief of the Polish-Lithuanian army and Grand Crown Hetman, the highest military rank in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

He was among the primary shareholders of the National Bank of Greece, donated to the University of Athens, and the Greek Orthodox Church through the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.. biography of Ioannis Papafis, founder of the Papafeio orphanage (Greek)  Biography  Papafis was born to a Macedonian Greek family in the city of Thessaloniki in 1792. His father Nicholas Papafis was a merchant. He spent the early years of his life in Thessaloniki and at the age of 16 he ventured to Smyrna, Alexandria and Malta. During this period he established his fortuitous enterprise working as a broker in Malta, a place he later considered his second home. His legacy of philanthropic activities include the founding of orphanages and large donations directed to educational and public services and both in Malta and Greece. Papafeio Orphanage His most famous contribution was the establishment of an orphanage in Thessaloniki, which he originally named \\"The Maltese\\" (), now commonly known as Papafeio (Œ†Œ±œÄŒ¨œÜŒµŒπŒø) after him. The male- only orphanage was most active after the Greek Civil War, when it sheltered orphans that numbered in the thousands. Designed by the architect Paionidis, the building of the Papafeio took 9 years to complete and is one of the most recent historical monuments of the city of Thessaloniki, representative of the city's architecture. At times of war and other crises it was temporarily utilized by the military, mostly as a hospital, as during the Balkan Wars and both World Wars. Excluding the above periods, the orphanage is in continuous operation until now. As per Papafis' request, as stated in his will, the institution also provides training in a number of professions to help its graduates establish themselves professionally.

Parker, the 30th novel in his Spenser series. In the novel, private investigator Spenser takes on a 28-year-old cold case murder, but gets pressured by FBI agents and a mobster to drop his investigation, which only increases his curiosity. Plot summary The novel begins with Spenser receiving a large payment for a case he worked for Rita Fiore. Due to this windfall, Spenser decides to work a case pro bono for an aspiring young actress named Daryl Gordon who is trying to find out who murdered her mother, Emily Gordon. She tells Spenser that her mother came to Boston from California to stay with her sister, and was then murdered by The Dread Scott Brigade; a revolutionary, anti-establishment movement in the 1970s, during a Boston bank robbery in 1974. Despite the case being decades cold, and her only payment being six Krispy Kreme donuts, Spenser likes the challenge and decides to take the case. He starts by getting the case files, and speaking to the original investigators. None remember anything significant, but Spenser soon realizes that an FBI report on the case is missing. So he questions the FBI about this missing file, and they claim no such report was ever written. Soon after two FBI agents accost Spenser in his home and tell him to leave the case alone. Next, a couple of goons working for mob boss Sonny Karnofsky threaten Spenser and also tell him to stop investigating the cold case. The FBI and the mob not wanting Spenser to investigate the case only serve to pique his interest. He wonders what it is they are trying to hide and questions Sonny directly, who then orders his henchmen to kill Spenser. Spenser decides to speak with Emily's sister, despite protests from Daryl. Emily's chain-smoking sister informs Spenser that Emily had not come to see her, but that she was actually involved with the Dread Scott Brigade. She tells them that they were both hippies, and involved in revolutionary movements during their college days in the 1970s. They would meet with prison inmates under the guise of trying to educate them, but really they were fanning their militant flames. She also tells Spenser that Emily had split from Daryl's father, and had followed a boyfriend of hers to Boston; a black revolutionary who called himself Shaka. Spenser and his friend and bodyguard Hawk then fly to California to speak with Daryl's father. Her father turns out to be a burnt-out old hippy who confirms Emily's sister's story. He also gives Spenser the names of some of Emily's friends; another black revolutionary who called himself Coyote, and a young woman named Bunny. Back in Boston, Spenser discovers that Emily Gordon attended Taft University, and decides to visit the school. There he discovers that Emily was good friends with a woman named Bonnie Karnofsky, otherwise known as Bunny. While leaving the university he realizes he is being followed. He and Hawk split up and lead the followers into a trap and kill them in a shootout. Convinced the hitmen were Karnofsky's goons, Spenser becomes even more interested in the case, especially with the connection between Karnofsky and Emily now known. He decides to head into the small town of Paradise to stake out Karnofsky's home in hopes of following Bonnie. The local police chief there, Jesse Stone, notices Spenser and Hawk watching the Karnofsky place and questions them about it. After checking them out with Healy, Jesse brings them coffee and they tell him about the investigation. Stone tells them that Bonnie doesn't live there, but will have his people look into her. Later, Stone's people inform Spenser that Bonnie often visits to sunbathe on her father's property. Later Spenser meets with Daryl to tell her what he has discovered. She gets upset and tells him to stop investigating. After speaking with Susan, Spenser realizes that Daryl thought she had an ideal childhood that was interrupted only by her mother's murder. She hated growing up with her father, and only wanted Spenser to confirm her mother's saintliness and that she would have had the perfect upbringing had she not been killed. She wanted to have a picture perfect story for her memoir as she became more famous as an actress. Despite her taking him off the case, Spenser decides to continue the investigation. He then discovers that the Karnofsky's have been paying Daryl's father $2,000 a month for the last 28 years. He and Hawk fly out to California again, and this time Daryl's father tells him that Daryl is actually Bonnie and Abner Fancy's (a.k.a. Shaka) child. Bonnie had the child with Shaka, but she did not want her so she gave her to Emily who raised her for six years. After Emily was murdered they sent Daryl back to the man she knew as her father and paid him to raise her and keep his mouth shut about her true parentage. Sonny Karnofsky did this because he was humiliated that his daughter had a child with a black man. Sonny also later discovers that the man who called himself Coyote was an FBI informant, which is why the FBI buried the case. They did not want people to know that their informant was in The Dread Scott Brigade and that he participated in a bank robbery. Spenser goes back to Boston with this information. Once again he is trailed by gunmen, and after leading them to a stadium where Susan and he often work out, kills them in another shootout. He decides he must finish the case so he can protect himself and Susan. He then visits Jesse Stone, and after telling him the latest information, tells him he plans to kidnap Bonnie Karnofsky from her father's house the next time she visits. Stone agrees to not get involved, and even takes Spenser out on a boat to show him the spot where Bonnie sunbathes. Later, Spenser and Hawk stake out the place and discover that she always swims out to a raft to cool down after lying in the sun a while. They wait for her to swim out again and when she does they pull up in a speed boat and kidnap her. They take her back to Susan's place and there Bonnie confesses to being Daryl's mother and killing Emily. She killed Emily during the robbery because she was jealous of her. She had given up her child to be with Shaka. And then Shaka left her for the woman she had given the child to. Later Shaka killed their bank robbery accomplice, Rob, as he was the only one that knew Bonnie killed Emily. Sonny Karnofsky then killed Shaka because he didn't want his daughter with a black man. He then arranged for her to marry one of his old bodyguards, a man named Ziggy. Spenser calls Sonny and has him meet him at Susan's house. He tells Sonny what he knows, but agrees to not take the information to the police if Sonny will agree to back off of him and Susan. Sonny agrees, and he and Bonnie leave.

It is used in elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) as a means of producing a one-way function. The literature presents this operation as scalar multiplication, as written in Hessian form of an elliptic curve. A widespread name for this operation is also elliptic curve point multiplication, but this can convey the wrong impression of being a multiplication between two points. Basics Given a curve, E, defined along some equation in a finite field (such as E: ), point multiplication is defined as the repeated addition of a point along that curve. Denote as for some scalar (integer) n and a point that lies on the curve, E. This type of curve is known as a Weierstrass curve. The security of modern ECC depends on the intractability of determining n from given known values of Q and P if n is large (known as the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem by analogy to other cryptographic systems). This is because the addition of two points on an elliptic curve (or the addition of one point to itself) yields a third point on the elliptic curve whose location has no immediately obvious relationship to the locations of the first two, and repeating this many times over yields a point nP that may be essentially anywhere. Intuitively, this is not dissimilar to the fact that if you had a point P on a circle, adding 42.57 degrees to its angle may still be a point \\"not too far\\" from P, but adding 1000 or 1001 times 42.57 degrees will yield a point that may be anywhere on the circle. Reverting this process, i.e., given Q=nP and P and determining n can therefore only be done by trying out all possible n‚Äîan effort that is computationally intractable if n is large. Point operations Elliptic curve point operations: Addition (shown in facet 1), doubling (facets 2 and 4) and negation (facet 3). There are three commonly defined operations for elliptic curve points, addition, doubling and negation. =Point at infinity= Point at infinity is the identity element of elliptic curve arithmetic. Adding it to any point results in that other point, including adding point at infinity to itself. That is: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathcal{O} + \\\\mathcal{O} = \\\\mathcal{O}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathcal{O} + P = P \\\\end{align} Point at infinity is also written as . =Point negation= Point negation is finding such a point, that adding it to itself will result in point at infinity (). :\\\\begin{align} P + (-P) = \\\\mathcal{O} \\\\end{align} For elliptic curves that is a point with the same x coordinate but negated y coordinate: :\\\\begin{align} (x, y) + (-(x, y)) &= \\\\mathcal{O}\\\\\\\\\\\\ (x, y) + (x, -y) &= \\\\mathcal{O}\\\\\\\\\\\\ (x, -y) &= -(x, y) \\\\end{align} =Point addition= With 2 distinct points, P and Q, addition is defined as the negation of the point resulting from the intersection of the curve, E, and the straight line defined by the points P and Q, giving the point, R. :\\\\begin{align} P + Q &= R \\\\\\\\\\\\ (x_p, y_p) + (x_q, y_q) &= (x_r, y_r) \\\\end{align}. Assuming the elliptic curve, E, is given by , this can be calculated as: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\lambda &= \\\\frac{y_q - y_p}{x_q - x_p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_r &= \\\\lambda^2 - x_p - x_q \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_r &= \\\\lambda(x_p - x_r) - y_p \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} These equations are correct when neither point is the point at infinity, . This is important for the ECDSA verification algorithm where the hash value could be zero. =Point doubling= Where the points P and Q, are coincident (at the same coordinates), addition is similar, except that there is no well-defined straight line through P, so the operation is closed using limiting case, the tangent to the curve, E, at P. This is calculated as above, except with: :\\\\lambda = \\\\frac{3x_p^2 + a}{2y_p} where a is from the defining equation of the curve, E, above. Point multiplication The straightforward way of computing a point multiplication is through repeated addition. However, this is a fully exponential approach to computing the multiplication. =Double- and-add= The simplest method is the double-and-add method, similar to multiply-and-square in modular exponentiation. The algorithm works as follows: To compute dP, start with the binary representation for d: , where . There are two possible iterative algorithms. Iterative algorithm, index increasing: N ‚Üê P Q ‚Üê 0 for i from 0 to m do if di = 1 then Q ‚Üê point_add(Q, N) N ‚Üê point_double(N) return Q Iterative algorithm, index decreasing: Q ‚Üê 0 for i from m down to 0 do Q ‚Üê point_double(Q) if di = 1 then Q ‚Üê point_add(Q, P) return Q An alternative way of writing the above as a recursive function is f(P, d) is if d = 0 then return 0 # computation complete else if d = 1 then return P else if d mod 2 = 1 then return point_add(P, f(P, d - 1)) # addition when d is odd else return f(point_double(P), d/2) # doubling when d is even where f is the function for multiplying, P is the coordinate to multiply, d is the number of times to add the coordinate to itself. Example: 100P can be written as ' and thus requires six point double operations and two point addition operations. 100P would be equal to f(P, 100). This algorithm requires log2(d) iterations of point doubling and addition to compute the full point multiplication. There are many variations of this algorithm such as using a window, sliding window, NAF, NAF-w, vector chains, and Montgomery ladder. =Windowed method= In the windowed version of this algorithm, one selects a window size w and computes all \\\\scriptstyle 2^w values of \\\\scriptstyle dP for \\\\scriptstyle d ~=~ 0,\\\\, 1,\\\\, 2,\\\\, \\\\dots,\\\\, 2^w \\\\,-\\\\, 1. The algorithm now uses the representation \\\\scriptstyle d ~=~ d_0 \\\\,+\\\\, 2^wd_1 \\\\,+\\\\, 2^{2w}d_2 \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\cdots \\\\,+\\\\, 2^{mw}d_m and becomes Q ‚Üê 0 for i from m to 0 do Q ‚Üê point_double_repeat(Q, w) if di > 0 then Q ‚Üê point_add(Q, diP) # using pre- computed value of diP return Q This algorithm has the same complexity as the double-and-add approach with the benefit of using fewer point additions (which in practice are slower than doubling). Typically, the value of w is chosen to be fairly small making the pre-computation stage a trivial component of the algorithm. For the NIST recommended curves, \\\\scriptstyle w ~=~ 4 is usually the best selection. The entire complexity for a n-bit number is measured as \\\\scriptstyle n \\\\,+\\\\, 1 point doubles and \\\\scriptstyle 2^w \\\\,-\\\\, 2 \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\frac{n}{w} point additions. =Sliding-window method= In the sliding-window version, we look to trade off point additions for point doubles. We compute a similar table as in the windowed version except we only compute the points \\\\scriptstyle dP for \\\\scriptstyle d ~=~ 2^{w-1},\\\\, 2^{w-1} \\\\,+\\\\, 1,\\\\, \\\\dots,\\\\, 2^w \\\\,-\\\\, 1. Effectively, we are only computing the values for which the most significant bit of the window is set. The algorithm then uses the original double-and-add representation of \\\\scriptstyle d ~=~ d_0 \\\\,+\\\\, 2d_1 \\\\,+\\\\, 2^2d_2 \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\cdots \\\\,+\\\\, 2^md_m. Q ‚Üê 0 for i from m downto 0 do if di = 0 then Q ‚Üê point_double(Q) else t ‚Üê extract j (up to w ‚àí 1) additional bits from d (including di) i ‚Üê i ‚àí j if j < w then Perform double-and-add using t return Q else Q ‚Üê point_double_repeat(Q, w) Q ‚Üê point_add(Q, tP) return Q This algorithm has the benefit that the pre-computation stage is roughly half as complex as the normal windowed method while also trading slower point additions for point doublings. In effect, there is little reason to use the windowed method over this approach, except that the former can be implemented in constant time. The algorithm requires \\\\scriptstyle w \\\\,-\\\\, 1 \\\\,+\\\\, n point doubles and at most \\\\scriptstyle 2^{w-1} \\\\,-\\\\, 1 \\\\,+\\\\, \\\\frac{n}{w} point additions. =-ary non-adjacent form (NAF) method= In the non-adjacent form we aim to make use of the fact that point subtraction is just as easy as point addition to perform fewer (of either) as compared to a sliding-window method. The NAF of the multiplicand \\\\scriptstyle d must be computed first with the following algorithm i ‚Üê 0 while (d > 0) do if (d mod 2) = 1 then di ‚Üê d mods 2w d ‚Üê d ‚àí di else di = 0 d ‚Üê d/2 i ‚Üê i + 1 return (di‚àí1, di-2, ‚Ä¶, d0) Where the signed modulo function mods is defined as if (d mod 2w) >= 2w‚àí1 return (d mod 2w) ‚àí 2w else return d mod 2w This produces the NAF needed to now perform the multiplication. This algorithm requires the pre-computation of the points \\\\scriptstyle \\\\lbrace 1,\\\\, 3,\\\\, 5,\\\\, \\\\dots,\\\\, 2^{w-1} \\\\,-\\\\, 1 \\\\rbrace P and their negatives, where \\\\scriptstyle P is the point to be multiplied. On typical Weierstrass curves, if \\\\scriptstyle P ~=~ \\\\lbrace x,\\\\, y \\\\rbrace then \\\\scriptstyle -P ~=~ \\\\lbrace x,\\\\, -y \\\\rbrace. So in essence the negatives are cheap to compute. Next, the following algorithm computes the multiplication \\\\scriptstyle dP: Q ‚Üê 0 for j ‚Üê i ‚àí 1 downto 0 do Q ‚Üê point_double(Q) if (dj != 0) Q ‚Üê point_add(Q, djG) return Q The wNAF guarantees that on average there will be a density of \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac{1}{w \\\\,+\\\\, 1} point additions (slightly better than the unsigned window). It requires 1 point doubling and \\\\scriptstyle 2^{w-2} \\\\,-\\\\, 1 point additions for precomputation. The algorithm then requires \\\\scriptstyle n point doublings and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac{n}{w \\\\,+\\\\, 1} point additions for the rest of the multiplication. One property of the NAF is that we are guaranteed that every non-zero element \\\\scriptstyle d_i is followed by at least \\\\scriptstyle w \\\\,-\\\\, 1 additional zeroes. This is because the algorithm clears out the lower \\\\scriptstyle w bits of \\\\scriptstyle d with every subtraction of the output of the mods function. This observation can be used for several purposes. After every non-zero element the additional zeroes can be implied and do not need to be stored. Secondly, the multiple serial divisions by 2 can be replaced by a division by \\\\scriptstyle 2^w after every non-zero \\\\scriptstyle d_i element and divide by 2 after every zero. It has been shown that through application of a FLUSH+RELOAD side-channel attack on OpenSSL, the full private key can be revealed after performing cache-timing against as few as 200 signatures performed. =Montgomery ladder= The Montgomery ladder approach computes the point multiplication in a fixed amount of time. This can be beneficial when timing or power consumption measurements are exposed to an attacker performing a side-channel attack. The algorithm uses the same representation as from double-and-add. R0 ‚Üê 0 R1 ‚Üê P for i from m downto 0 do if di = 0 then R1 ‚Üê point_add(R0, R1) R0 ‚Üê point_double(R0) else R0 ‚Üê point_add(R0, R1) R1 ‚Üê point_double(R1) return R0 This algorithm has in effect the same speed as the double-and-add approach except that it computes the same number of point additions and doubles regardless of the value of the multiplicand d. This means that at this level the algorithm does not leak any information through timing or power. However, it has been shown that through application of a FLUSH+RELOAD side-channel attack on OpenSSL, the full private key can be revealed after performing cache-timing against only one signature at a very low cost.

Overview It is based widely on her own life experiences and interactions with other people. The humor contained within it draws from a decidedly eccentric and slightly exaggerated view of the creator's surroundings, sometimes leading to surrealistic moments and other slightly absurd events transpiring throughout the course of any given strip of the comic. Breeden also produces another webcomic, Geebas on Parade, which centers around a live action role-playing game. The comic seems to abandon a continual story in lieu of offering up a series of experiences conveyed into the comic style format based on what happens to Breeden in reality. It is updated daily except under special circumstances. Typically, weekday comics are multi-panel comedic pieces, Saturday comics are single-panel comedic pieces, and Sunday \\"comics\\" are non- comedic artwork, usually in ink or watercolour. The comic addresses a wide array of subjects throughout its run, making it often hard to attach any single recurring theme to it. The style of humour also tends to vary, ranging from the more blatant and widely recognised jokes to more subtle attempts at humour mixed in with social satire and related candour regarding subjects intended to inject a dose of seriousness amidst a punchline. The Devil's Panties is hosted courtesy of Keenspot; in addition to hosting the section featuring the comic itself and its archive of past updates, it also hosts the creator's online portfolio amongst other sections (a section involving the sale of merchandise related to the comic is also located there as well). Silent Devil Productions began publishing the graphic novel version of the webcomic in March 2006. In 2008, Archaia Studios Press took over publication.ASP Showcase: The Devil's Panties, Newsarama, February 13, 2008 Misspellings and homonyms often appear in the dialogue, due to the author's practice of phonetically sounding out or spelling words as a way of working around her dyslexia. Breeden contributed to the Create a Comic Project.Rosa, Jamie Lee. \\"Create a Comic Project.\\" Characters Jennie Breeden - Jennie (the creator of the comic itself) is the star of her webcomic. Her personality in the comic tends to parallel her personality in real life, as do the events in her life and the people she meets therein. Her character is depicted to be a feministic geek who enjoys reading comic books and attending various conventions with her friends. Jennie has also, on occasion, shown a tendency to break the fourth wall by addressing the readers of the comic usually by indicating that a brief hiatus will be taken during the course of the strip and that the readers should expect content whenever the real-life counterpart of Jennie returns. The comic version of Jennie has short brown hair, as the real Jennie had the same hair style when she began the strip. The \\"Real\\" Jennie, when appearing in comic format, is differentiated by her longer hair and the fact that she occasionally wears different clothing (comic Jennie is almost always seen wearing a stylized labrys t-shirt and large boots emblazoned with flames) Will - The boyfriend of both the comic Jennie and real-life Jennie. His life in the comic tends to revolve around video games and he is often depicted to be a source of comic relief. Whether this mirrors his actual life or not remains to be seen. Will and Jennie have broken up, as have their comic counterparts in the early August 2009 comic strips. According to the comic strip, their break up was on good terms and they may still be friends. DJ - A friend and role model of Jennie who spends most of her time kicking ass and being the \\"only\\" lesbian. Aili - A long-time friend of Jennie. They met when they were children and one might say that Aili was the one who got Jennie into drawing in the first place. Darcy - Jennie's first roommate. She is characterised by her exaggerated height, extreme attractiveness and her love of shopping (in stark contrast to Jennie's hatred of it). She wears large black boots, a white shirt and a black pencil skirt. Despite her love of gothic apparel and nightclubs, Darcy is a \\"Squealing girly girl\\". Much is made of her long legs, highlighted by the short skirt she wears. Stephany - Jennie's roommate from October 2003 to April 2004. She is apparently known to make an exquisite lasagna. Lessa - Another one of Jennie's roommates who stayed with her from 1998-1999 and subsequently 2000-2001. She considers her pets, Dash (a cat) and Bixby (a chameleon) to be her \\"babies\\". Chris - Yet another one of Jennie's roommates who stayed with her from 2001-2002. He is constantly surrounded by giggling women. He is based on Chris Daily, the creator of the webcomic Striptease, and the one who got Jennie into doing her own webcomic. Tracey - Yet another one of Jennie's roommates who stayed with her throughout the course of 2001-2002. Her two pets are named Bailey and Sammy. Skyler and Summer - Jennie's sisters, whom she fiercely looks out for. Skyler is a poet who also makes very disturbing puppets. Summer, previously considered young enough to be jailbait, undertakes kickboxing lessons. The real Skyler also creates comics. Jennie's two older brothers, Eric and Christian. Jennie's niece and nephew ‚Äî Two cute little scamps who love Jennie very much. Either that, or the candy she gives them. Karl - A friend of Jennie's since her first year of college. Jesus Christ - Depicted as a long haired hippy. He is often shown discussing various issues with Jennie regarding matters like the character's choice of religion amongst other things. Satan - Depicted to be a calm and calculating individual, who, oddly enough, agrees with Jesus Christ on a number of topics. He is also known to exhibit a keen fashion sense. Jesus and Satan are actually drawn as the same basic figure, then augmented with horns or a halo, as well as clothing, to identify them. The Angel and The Devil - Always trying to protect Jennie or cause trouble for her. They pop up every now and again, and while the Devil tends to get her way more often than not, the Angel is the worst influence of the two. These characters are most likely the embodiments of the opposing sides of Jennie's conscience and are examples of a gag often seen throughout many other venues in which a character is faced with a moral dilemma. The Princess - A third side of Jennie's conscience, the Angel and Devil tend to dislike the Princess for her excited and overly girly personality. The Princess doesn't make as many appearances in the comic strip as the Angel and Devil. The Pirate - Smooth and smarmy, like any good pirate. Minus the scurvy of course. I guess he eats his Vitamin C. And drinks lots of rum. You can visit him here: http://www.nigelsade.com/ Betty - One of the lesser known pirates, but she probably causes more damage and mischief than any of her male counterparts. Obby - Jennie's boyfriend after Will, Obby is first introduced in the January 14, 2010 strip. Obby is illustrated as much more robust than Will and has long curly hair and a short beard. He periodically makes jokes about white people, though his own race has not yet been specified. Obby proposed Saturday September 4, 2011 during a Kilt Blowing event at Dragon Con. Their wedding is shown in the July 10‚Äì12, 2012 strips. Laurell K. Hamilton: This internationally best-selling author of Jennie's acquaintance has been featured in occasional guest appearances since the two met. One such feature was used as a bonus-type extra feature in a recent 'Anita Blake' novel. Jonathon Greene: Laurell's current partner, sometimes known online as 'Eridine' was featured in the 'Anita Blake' bonus feature comic. It concerns an episode where they all visit a restaurant where a seemingly gay waiter is left somewhat discombobulated by his attraction to Jon. Laurell then chastises Jon for encouraging him as she wants their food quickly - she is seemingly quite hungry at this point.

The zoo started as the Gainesville Community Circus in 1930. It is home to more than 130 animals. History The zoo was founded by A. Morton Smith as Gainesville Community Circus, and opened in 1930 at the Cooke County Fair, Fair Park, in Gainesville. A fire at the zoo in 1954 destroyed circus equipment and from 1954 the animals were kept permanently in enclosures. In 1954 the zoo was renamed after the film actor and director (and Gainesville native) Frank Buck, who collected wild animals from all over the world, and who also worked as a ring master at the zoo. The zoo was moved to its current location in Leonard Park in 1962. The Frank Buck Exhibit opened at the zoo in March 2008 showing items donated by Buck's daughter, Barbara Buck, that once belonged to her father including camp tools and media memorabilia. Facilities The handicap and stroller accessible path around the zoo is about a mile long, with an elevated walkway over the kangaroos, giraffes and zebras.

Maghi came to be associated with the forty Sikhs and the battle of Muktsar. The Maghi fair is held to honour the memory of the forty Sikh warriors killed during the Battle of Muktsar in 1705. Muktsar, originally called Khidrana, was named as Muktsar (\\"the pool of liberation\\") following the battle. These forty Sikhs, led by their leader Mahan Singh, had formally deserted Sri Guru Gobind Singh in the need of hour, and signed a written memorandum to the effect. When Mai Bhago, a valiant and upright lady, heard of this cowardly act, she scolded the Singh's and inspired them refresh with spirit of bravery for which Sikhs are known. Hence, the unit went back and joined the Guru who was already engaged in action at Khidrana. All forty of them attained martyrdom. The memorandum (bedawa) was torn-down by the Guru himself just before Mahan Singh died. People gather from all over Punjab, even other parts of India to join the festival which is in fact spread over many days.

The country's biggest circuses, Apollo and Gemini, are there as a matter of rule, merry-go-rounds and giant wheels, and the famous Well of Death (trick motorcycling inside consortium of wood planks) are the special attraction for children. While kids enjoy the rides, there are tuck shops that are quite a find. Women buy crockery and home decor, men mostly interest in special (name embedded on rice grain) keyrings, posters. Kids have special corner for toys and other things. The shops sell out goggles, kitchen utensils, makeup, shoes and clothes, all in average quality and lowest market possible cost. You don't need big bucks to shop a lot. However, very limited use of electronic payments is done, as the end merchant is a poor villager, hardly touched by digital world.

The debate over the \\"size zero\\" image and catwalk models has heated up recently with the announcement by Lynne Featherstone, the equalities minister, that she will convene a series of discussions in Autumn 2010 with the fashion industry, to discuss how to promote body confidence among young people. This has received much press coverage (e.g. Fashion industry faces airbrushing clampdown) and re-opened the debate about the treatment of \\"real women\\" and the hero worship of \\"size zero\\" catwalk models. Lembrassa founder, Laura Cohen, encountered the \\"real women\\" versus \\"size zero\\" issues before they became a popular movement and determined to do something about it. She started the company because in her own words \\"I was fed up with the treatment I was getting when trying to buy larger cup size lingerie in store or even online. I felt frustrated with the high street retailers who were continually being 'out of stock' of my size.\\" As well as founding Lembrassa, Laura has written a number of published articles on the issues facing larger-busted women including guidance on getting the right size bra when 80% of women have got it wrong. Lembrassa also follows its founder's belief in open marketplaces by having a single worldwide website and a single set of pricing. Customers from all over the world can purchase at the same sterling price. This approach is underlined by another of the founder's articles \\"The world is you local shop\\".

The company was acquired by Skyscanner and shutdown. Users were able to enter their starting and destination addresses and the service searches thousands of routes across combinations of transportation including flights, trains, ferries, and ground transfers including taxis, driving and car parking. Results could be filtered according to specific user preferences, budget, time available and carbon footprint. The service was independent from any particular carrier and searches hundreds of transportation carriers. Zoombu did not include booking capabilities, but instead it linked to transportation suppliers where it is possible to book components of any route. The company was based in South-West London. History The idea for Zoombu was developed by Dr Alistair Hann whilst working as a researcher at the University of Oxford in 2008. He was frustrated at the time it took to search for flight routes and compare these to alternatives such as taking the train or ferry, then research connections to determine the best overall option. Others shared his frustration and he entered the idea for a door-to-door travel search engine into a competition run by Oxford Entrepreneurs called Ideal Idol, which he won. Shortly afterwards he asked Rachel Evatt (n√©e Armitage), a friend and colleague from undergraduate engineering at Oxford to co-found the business. Zoombu‚Äôs search engine was available to a handful of users on a private basis from mid-2009. In March 2010, Zoombu‚Äôs Beta product was opened to the public, catering for searches from the UK to within Europe. In April 2010, the product was still in Beta and broader geographical coverage was expected to be added in September 2010. In January 2011, Skyscanner acquired Zoombu.

Ball (born 1964) is an American Physiologist (speciality: Biomechanics) and inventor. After completing a bachelor of science at the University of Oregon (Human Development & Performance - physiology & biomechanics emphasis) and a Master of Science at the University of Southern California (Systems Management), he became a co-founder of Symphonix Devices Inc. This company pioneered the development of middle ear implants and introduced the Vibrant Soundbridge to the market. Since 2003 Geoffery Ball holds the position of Chief Technical Officer at the VIBRANT MED-EL headquarters in Innsbruck, Austria. Background As a child, Geoffrey Ball suffered from a severe fever attack and as a result developed sensorineural hearing loss. After sometime, it became clear that this could not be corrected by using conventional hearing aids. As a young man, he searched for an alternative solution and in doing so was continually informed that active middle ear implants were only in the first development phase. Following his biomedical degree, Geoffrey Ball worked for many years in the field of neuroscience, biomedical and auditory research, he also is a pioneer in field the biomechanics of hearing. He developed a new type of Laser Doppler Vibrometer along with a based on the signal processing software developed in cooperation with Jont Allen (of Bell Labs). The result was the most sensitive optical vibrometer ever developed at the time. Ball was able to use this device to build and test the smallest hi-fidelity transducers in the world. This work lead to the development of the Floating Mass Transducer (FMT), a minute electromechanical converter which was suitable in transferring vibrations to the ossicles, the smallest bones in the body that transmit vibrations from the ear drum to the inner ear. He then went on to develop the Vibrant Soundbridge, a middle ear implant which comprises an implantable part, known as the VORP, which supplies the FMT with appropriate sound signal. The implant is powered by an externally worn audio processor. Geoffrey Ball was himself one of the first patients to be implanted with the Vibrant Soundbridge and is currently a bilateral user. He is the only living person known who was implanted with a medical device to cure a chronic medical condition that he also invented. He is the author of the 2011 autobiographical book \\"No More Laughing at the Deaf Boy\\" (288 pages, Haymon-verlag, Innsbruck-Wein) that tells the story from his boyhood in California to the creation and eventual dissolution of his company Symphonix Devices Inc. Since 2003, Geoffrey Ball has lived just outside Innsbruck, Austria with his wife and three sons. Patents Geoffrey Ball has over 102 issued and pending US and international patents covering 26 patent families in the field of hearing implants, drug delivery, neuro-stimulation and other implantable medical devices.http://www.uspto.gov/http://www.epo.org/index_de.html Achievements / Awards / Prizes 1998 Silicon Valley Inventor of the Year 1999 Engineer of the Year 2001 Politzer Society Prize for RTF paper 2002 2nd Annunzio Award in Science and Medicine 2013 Red Dot Design Award http://red-dot.de/pd/online- exhibition/work/?lang=en&code;=2013-15-7663&y;=2013&c;=167&a;=0 2013 Austrian State Prize for Innovation (Science and Medicine) http://www.austrianentrepreneurs.com/t-861.html 2013 Life Award http://www.lifeaward.org/wp/prof-geoffrey-ball/ Publications *Implantable hearing device performance measured by laser doppler interferometry Gan R;Dormer K;Wood M;Ball G;Dietz T Ear Nose Throat J, 76(5), 1997, p. 297-309 *Scanning laser doppler vibrometry of the middle ear ossicles Ball G;Huber A;Goode R.

Although the inner bark of several other Cinnamomum species is also used to make cinnamon, cinnamon from C. verum is considered by culinarians to be of superior quality. Description Cinnamomum verum trees are 10‚Äì15 metres (30‚Äì50 feet) tall. The leaves are ovate-oblong in shape and 7‚Äì18 cm (3‚Äì7 inches) long. The flowers, which are arranged in panicles, have a greenish color and a distinct odor. The fruit is a purple 1-cm drupe containing a single seed.Cinnamomum verum Cinnamon, Ceylon Cinnamon Tree PFAF Plant Database Cultivation The old botanical synonym for the tree, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, is derived from Sri Lanka's former name, Ceylon. Sri Lanka still produces 80‚Äì90% of the world's supply of C. verum, which is also cultivated on a commercial scale in the Seychelles and Madagascar. =Cultivars= There are several different cultivars of Cinnamomum verum based on the taste of bark: * Type 1 ‚Äì ; * Type 2 ‚Äì ; * Type 3 ‚Äì ; * Type 4 ‚Äì ; * Type 5 ‚Äì ; * Type 6 ‚Äì ; * Type 7 ‚Äì ; Processing The trees grow as leafy bushes, usually maxing out about 3 meters (10 ft) in height. They are first harvested at 3 years old, and continue producing well for 40-50 years. Small side branches (1.5-5 cm in diameter) are removed from the trees. The outer bark is removed, and made into mulch. Twigs, leaves & berries (seeds) are crushed and make cinnamon oil, a less valuable byproduct. The inner bark of the branches is loosened by being rubbed with a brass rod, then split with a brass or stainless steel knife, and then peeled off, as intact as possible. Long, full 'quills' of cinnamon are more valuable than broken pieces. These quills are then dried over several days, in the shade, then in darkness. All this work is done by hand by experienced workers; this is the most expensive part of producing cinnamon spice. Finally, the dried bark is cut into sticks or ground into powder for sale to consumers.

Enriching Digital Resources (2008-2009)  The twenty-five projects funded under Enriching Digital Resources Programme were the following: Anglo-Saxon Cluster Developed at King's College London, the Anglo-Saxon Cluster (ASC) brings together various online resources relating to Anglo-Saxon society. Automatic Biodiversity Literature Enhancement (ABLE) The aim of the project was to establish and extend information extraction techniques from scanned taxonomic literature in the Biodiversity Heritage Library. Scanned texts contain errors introduced by imperfect Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and other sources, so techniques are required that are robust in the face of such errors. Climbi√© Inquiry Data Corpus Online This is an archive of transcriptions of the examination of witnesses regarding the murder of Victoria Climbi√© in February 2000. This project has taken this large data set and made it available via the University of Huddersfield digital library. Creating Heritage Artefacts for Research and Teaching in an e-Repository (CHARTER) This project was a small-scale digitisation pilot, delivering an open-access repository (based on DSpace software) populated with a critical mass of 4,000 digital images drawn from resources in the Special Collections of the University of Exeter. The research collection includes over 2,000 images showcasing Victorian culture. Digitisation of Countryside Images The project has created digitised images of 13,000 glass plate negatives from the British magazine 'Farmer and Stockbreeder' and 'Farmers Weekly' photographic archive, dating from 1920-1965. These images have been catalogued and made available via the Museum of English Rural Life‚Äôs website. East London Lives a Digital Archive of 'London 2012' Beginning with interviews done in 2009, this archive has helped capture the feelings, aspirations and hopes of the communities of East London as they confront the reality of hosting the Olympics in 2012. The archive also contains academic research and contextual information from research teams working at University of East London. Enhancing Stained Glass Studies The Corpus Vitrearum Medii Aevi (CVMA) website provides access to 17,000 images of stained glass in British buildings and collections. This project has delivered enhanced metadata, an improved public interface, and a facility to create and manage user-generated content. Enhancing the VADS Image Collection This project has enhanced the VADS (Visual Arts Data Service) Image Collection, which holds over 130,000 images, freely available for educational use. The project developed mechanisms to automatically share data for teaching and research, improving the academic user experience, and facilitating greater academic use by giving users the ability to curate, annotate and publish their own image sets, thus stimulating use of the collection in new and potentially rejuvenating ways. Enlightening Science: Teaching and Learning Newtonianism in the 18th and 21st Centuries This project has created a series of tools that both general and expert users to understand the central concepts of Newton's his scientific achievements. This includes textual and audio introductions to freely available transcriptions of his most influential scientific texts, and also by employing video recreations of 18th century lecture courses in which doctrines were explicated for both 18th century genteel and academic audiences. Enriching the First World War Poetry Archive Based at the University of Oxford, the First World War Poetry Digital Archive has now added a number of new poetry collections, including David Jones and Siegfried Sassoon, to its existing online website. This new project sets out to enhance digital resources by making them more useful to practitioners and tying them in directly to curricula for pupils and students. Eton Myers Collection Virtual Museum The Eton Myers Collection provides free access to ancient Egyptian art through the creation of 3D models. Laser scanning in conjunction with the generation of a catalogue has created a Virtual Museum enabling global access to the collection, and will provide the centre piece of the University of Birmingham‚Äôs Virtual Worlds Laboratory (VWL). The project will also significantly reduce the need for the future transportation of these artefacts, thus ensuring their long-term conservation. The resulting digital data will be curated at the University of Birmingham. Exposing Marandet: French Plays from the 18th and 19th Centuries The Exposing Marandet project has made openly and freely available a coherent set of pamphlets during a seminal period of French history. The archive is an essential part of teaching at the University of Warwick, and of interest to a broad audience of enthusiasts and researchers. The digitised material is 1,500 18th- and early 19th-century French plays - comprising 75,000 pages - from the Library‚Äôs Marandet Collection, and to investigate opportunities to improve connections with the CESAR repository of French theatre resources. Furer-Haimendorf Archive digitisation This project is a comprehensive study of tribal cultures in South Asia including cine film, photographs and written journals before the influence of mid-twentieth century external influences. F√ºrer-Haimendorf was one of the few anthropologists of the inter-war generation in Europe to realise the importance of visual documentation. His collection of 26,000 images have now been digitised. The project will also used specialists in the relevant tribal cultures to catalogue these images and cross-reference a select group of them together with an unpublished diary, film footage and written material in the collection.F√ºrer-Haimendorf Collection_Homepage - Digital Archives and Special Collections Historical Hansards: Completing the Jigsaw The project will take more than 50 years of debates from the Upper Chamber of the Parliament of Northern Ireland from 1921 to 1972, the, and make it available online. The debates are wide-ranging in nature concerning the socio-economic and political development of a sometimes troubled part of the United Kingdom over a period of dramatic change. The project meets a clear demand amongst scholars in England and Wales for research material relating to the Northern Ireland that they simply do not have access to. Image Path This project has digitised three collections of pathology slides held by the University of Leeds ‚Äì The Matthew Stewart Collection, the Cancer Research Campaign Soft Tissues Sarcoma collection and early cases from the Pathology archive collection. The slides contain valuable information about diseases that are rare or were common but are now not seen or are not seen at such advanced stages. In the bigynnyng: the Manchester Middle English Digital Library This project has digitised 41 medieval English manuscripts from the John Rylands Library at the University of Manchester.. A total of approx 12,000 images and metadata will be accessible via a dedicated project website. The project is closely aligned with the Library‚Äôs strategic goals and with the wider strategic development of the University of Manchester. Musicians of Britain and Ireland 1900-1950 This project recovered 2000 recordings selected to showcase British and Irish performers recorded between 1900 and 1950, especially artists neglected by the newly formed EMI after the merger of the Gramophone Co and Columbia in 1931. The project also is to raise awareness of the extent to which record company policies shape public perceptions of musical excellence and the reputation of artistic communities. Resurrecting the Past: Virtual Antiquities in the 19th century This project aims to develop and digitise at the University of Bristol a collection of material of the Pompeii Court of the Crystal Palace. A virtual recreation of the Pompeii Court in the Crystal Palace exhibition has now been successfully created. Like the original exhibition, the model is a complete life-size model of an ancient Roman house, including paintings and everyday objects, that was preserved after the eruption of mount Vesuvius. Sudan Archive Digitisation Project This project will digitise key printed and archive resources from Durham University's Sudan Archive to make them freely accessible via the internet to scholars all over the world. It will be a pilot to establish a preservation quality digitisation suite within Durham University's Archives and Special Collections. Museum of Design in Plastics digitisation project This project involves the creation of digital record of artefacts demonstrating design in plastics and the functional specification to support research into design in plastics and its cultural impact. It was created to enhance research and student learning and holds more than 8,000 (predominantly 20th Century) international, historical and contemporary design examples relating directly to the Bournemouth Art University College's specialist areas of study. The Serving Soldier The Serving Soldier will provide digital access to national archives held in the Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives. As such it will support demonstrable internal and external demand. In taking the theme of the multi-faceted role of the soldier, it will expose a proportion of little known material (hidden stories) and provide a body of material of contemporary relevance to researchers, students and today‚Äôs serving soldiers. UK Colonial Registers & Royal Navy logbooks: Making the past available for the future This project seeks to identify sources of old, previously overlooked, marine meteorological data from colonial (especially lighthouse) records and from the logbooks of Royal Navy vessels through from the 18th century and, thereby, to lend a longer-term perspective to more recent climatic variations. The project has digitised around 45,000 logbook pages, and over 20,000 images. Logbooks from many historic ships and voyages are included in the project, including those from: the Beagle, the Endeavour and Discovery. Versatile Digitisation Framework Project This project (VERDI) has developed a technical framework for the digitisation, cataloguing and web presentation of specialist material. The project has also created 'snippets' of code for embedding in websites and allowing searching of one or more specified collections. Documentation allowing for wider adoption of the framework will be available to academics at the University of Kent and to the wider academic community. Virtual Manuscript Room The Virtual Manuscript Room (VMR) brings together previously unavailable manuscripts, including the Mingana Collection of Middle Eastern Manuscripts. The Virtual Manuscript Room (VMR) will bring together digital resources related to manuscript materials (digital images, descriptions and other metadata, transcripts) in an environment which will permit libraries to add images, scholars to add and edit metadata and transcripts online, and users to access material. The centrepiece of the VMR will be full digitised manuscripts from Birmingham‚Äôs Mingana collection of Middle Eastern manuscripts. Two other groups of content, amounting to over 50,000 digital images of manuscripts, 500 manuscript descriptions and around 1000 pages of transcripts, will be included in the VMR: materials relating to the New Testament and to medieval vernacular texts (Dante, Chaucer, and others). Welsh Ballads ‚Äì completing the British ballad network The Welsh Ballads project will fill the final gap in the network of digitized collections of printed ballads around Britain, the Bodleian, National Library of Scotland and Glasgow University having undertaken projects on English and Scottish ballads already; between them these three contain about 30,000 ballads. A total of 5,000 ballads will be digitized, from the earliest 18th Century ballads to the final few published in the 20th Century. In total this will produce around 20,000 pages of digitized text images (all out of copyright).

Civil defence in Finland is the responsibility of the Ministry of Interior under the Civil Defence Act of 1958. It is directed to provide civil defence to protect persons and property in wartime as well as in peacetime. The act stipulates that the ministry is responsible for providing shelters in high-risk areas, for evacuating civilian population from threatened areas, and for limiting damage from natural disasters. In emergency situations, firefighting, rescue, ambulance, and first-aid services are coordinated with the civil defence effort. Civil defence operations are entirely a civilian responsibility. The ministry delegates the implementation of national policy to county and municipal authorities, which act through locally appointed civil defence boards. These boards supervise operations from more than 100 civil defence centres designated throughout the country. Personnel in national and local government agencies, committed to civil defence in emergency situations, and in independent voluntary organizations that would come under their jurisdiction number over 100,000. Non-government organizations involved in civil defence activities include the Finnish Red Cross and the Rescue Service. Police are also assigned to reinforce civil defence workers as conditions require. An alarm system is in place in urban centres to warn the civilian population of threatened attacks. During an emergency situation, instructions would be broadcast through normal media channels. The early warning civil defence system is tied into the nationwide military air surveillance system. The fortified door of a shelter. Apartment blocks in Finland often have such shelters in the basement if there is no community shelter nearby. Note the international civil defence symbol on the door. The Ministry of Interior maintains hard shelters, capable of accommodating 3.6 million persons, in cities and in other densely populated areas where two-thirds of the country's population live. They are built to withstand the detonation of a nuclear bomb at ground zero. There is no shelter program in rural areas nor are most detached dwellings and townhouses equipped with shelters. About 10 per cent of the shelters are carved out of natural rock, but most are beneath office and residential buildings. Some are designed for multiple use as parking garages, schoolrooms, skating rinks, and swimming pools. By law, builders are obliged to include shelters in blocks measuring or more. In the late 1980s, in Helsinki, 536,000 spaces were provided, of which 118,000 were in large rock shelters and 14,000 were in subway stations. The shelter space was sufficient to accommodate over 100 per cent of the nighttime population of the city, but only 67 per cent of the daytime population. The most serious shortcoming of Finland's civil defence system is that 1.5 million Finns had no access to shelters. Another reason for concern is that many shelters are poorly equipped and maintained. All shelters are supposed to be outfitted with self-contained power and ventilation systems, sanitary facilities, and emergency supplies. Nevertheless, inspections during 1986 found that two-thirds of shelters in private buildings had some deficiencies. Contingency plans include massive evacuation of civilians from likely target areas, threatened with attack by conventional forces in time of war. Medical services for civilian casualties would be provided at local facilities in coordination with the civil defence branch of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. In the 1980s, civil defence authorities considered, however, that evacuation of the civilian population to escape fallout following a nuclear attack would be pointless, and no provision was made for such a contingency. The public's perception of civil defence efforts was marked by considerable indifference during the 1980s. Although its system was far more complete than the systems in most countries of Western Europe, Finland's annual expenditure per capita on civil defence of US$12 was well below the rate of other Scandinavian countries, which averaged US$20 per capita. The nuclear accident at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union in 1986 underscored Finland's vulnerability and triggered renewed concern over shortcomings in the civil defence program. In response, the government announced plans in 1988 to introduce an automatic radiation surveillance network to supplement the existing manual one and to ensure that an outdoor alarm system was operational in all municipalities. Now this network has been completed and is in operation.Text from PD source: US Library of Congress: A Country Study: Finland, Library of Congress Call Number DL1012 .A74 1990.

IDF soldiers returned fire and responded with artillery shelling and airstrikes on Lebanese positions, killing two Lebanese soldiers and Al Akhbar correspondent Assaf Abu Rahhal. and wounding five soldiers and one journalist. This was the most serious escalation on the border since the 2006 Lebanon War. The Lebanese Army asserted that it opened fire on Israeli soldiers to contravene the attempt of Israelis to intrude through the border of Lebanon in violation of the internationally recognized border between Israel and Lebanon. Israel claimed that it only crossed over a fence on its side of the Blue Line.UNIFIL says Israelis were in their territory, Beirut refutes claim, Daily Star August 5, 2010 The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) confirmed Israel's position, adding that Israel had informed them of the border work beforehand. Lebanon's Information Minister later stated that \\"the Blue Line is not the international border and there are areas south of the Blue Line that are Lebanese territory.\\" The United States condemned the Lebanese fire on Israeli soldiers as \\"wholly unjustified and unwarranted\\",PM issues warnings to Lebanon, Hamas, Jerusalem Post April 8, 2010 and in response to the incident the United States House of Representatives announced a suspension of aid to the Lebanese Armed Forces. Lebanon responded by saying that it would decline any military assistance from the United States that is conditioned on its agreeing not to use those weapons against Israel.Lebanon says it will refuse military aid from U.S. that can't be used against Israel Haaretz August 12, 2010  Background  The Blue Line In the weeks leading up to the incident hostile rhetoric was traded between the Lebanese (particularly Hezbollah) and Israeli sides in light of the reports suggesting the Special Tribunal for Lebanon would indict Hezbollah members. Following an impromptu visit to Lebanon by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and Syria's Bashar al-Assad just days before the incident, various media in Lebanon and outside said the likelihood of sparking an outbreak of violence eased. Two days before the incident, however, Assad made a statement marking Syria's Army Day warning that \\"The spectre of real peace in the region is disappearing, and the possibility of war is increasing.\\" There were conflicting reports as to which side provoked the firefight. The Lebanese Army claimed the conflict began when an Israeli patrol attempted to uproot some trees between the Lebanese villages of Adaisseh and Kfar Kila, while the Israel Defense Forces claimed that Lebanese snipers opened fire on an observation post inside Israel while Israeli troops were carrying out routine maintenance on the Israeli side of the border. UNIFIL confirmed the Israeli claim that the soldiers were inside Israeli territory when the clashes erupted. Apache AH-64D. According to an IDF spokesperson, \\"the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) fired at an IDF position along the Lebanese border in northern Israel. The soldiers were in Israeli territory, carrying out routine maintenance and was pre-coordinated with UNIFIL.\\" Only then, the spokesperson said, did Israel return fire. The Israel Defense Forces released aerial footage that claims to show the IDF soldiers were standing in Israeli territory when fired on, and \\"did not cross the Lebanese border.\\" United Nations representatives confirmed the photos. Israeli analysts speculated that a renegade commander sympathetic to Hezbollah may have ordered the attack. Israeli soldiers also showed UNIFIL representatives the observation post they claimed had been fired on, which had bloodstains at the entrance. According to Lebanon army officials, Israeli soldiers crossed into Lebanon to uproot trees which according to Israel blocked their view and made surveillance over Lebanon border posts uneasy. A military spokesperson said that upon of overpassing of the border by Israeli troops the Lebanese border defence troops as of first procedure fired warning shots and requested the Israeli troops to cease their unsanctioned actions, however the Israeli troops immediately started a targeted fire on their position, forcing them to return fire in defense. A Lebanese Army official later officially confirmed that Lebanese troops had fired warning shots first, after the Israelis had crossed into Lebanese territory. = Allegations of planned ambush = A report released by senior Israeli officials in Jerusalem accuses the Lebanese army of taking \\"advantage of the fact that the IDF delayed several hours of maintenance work\\" near the Lebanese border, to \\"plan and prepare an ambush\\" against IDF troops. According to the report, the Israeli Army contacted UNIFIL at 6:00 on August 3 to inform them of maintenance work to commence three hours later. UNIFIL representatives responded that their forces needed extra time to prepare for the IDF presence and requested the IDF delay work until 11:00. The Israeli army delayed the operation by several hours. UNIFIL commanders then told the Lebanese Army of the IDF plans. At this point it was suspected by Israel that the Lebanese military used the extra time to prepare an ambush, even inviting journalists and photographers to the site to observe its aftermath. IDF officers alleged that Lebanese military called in journalists and photographers in advance of the confrontation. Officials have questioned the large presence of journalists and broadcast trucks at the scene before the clash ensued:  Confrontation  Village of Adaisseh in Lebanon, as seen from Misgav Am, Israel. Area of the 2010 Israel‚ÄìLebanon border clash marked with red According to the Israeli military the fighting began when a Lebanese Army sniper unit fired on an IDF observation post inside Israeli territory after receiving authorization from Lebanese commanders. The gunshots were fired from a range of about 700 meters from a building in the Lebanese village of Adaisseh. An Israeli military spokeswoman said there were about two or three sniper shots, and that the surprise attack seemed like an ambush. IDF soldiers immediately fired on Lebanese troops with small arms, and the Lebanese returned fire. The IDF launched a heavy artillery attack targeting Lebanese Army outposts, claiming that the outposts held a \\"dominating position\\" and could have posed a threat to troops still on the ground. Israeli artillery fired at an army position in Adaisseh. One artillery shell hit a civilian area. Lebanese M113 APCs, like those destroyed in the incident. Several minutes after the confrontation began, an Israeli Air Force AH-64 Apache helicopter gunship attacked a Lebanese Armed Forces command center in the southern Lebanese town of Al Taybeh, destroying several M113 armored personnel carriers. Throughout these assaults, the IDF had been receiving a number of requests from the senior command levels of the Lebanese Army, asking for a cease-fire to allow the Lebanese to evacuate their casualties. Later, the IDF agreed to a cease-fire, and halted its attacks. Half an hour later, a Lebanese Army rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) team fired a single round at an Israeli tank, but missed. This tank then fired at the Lebanese position from which the attack had come.  UNIFIL report  United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) officials in Lebanon said that the IDF informed the organization of its intention to conduct routine maintenance in the area where the Lebanese Army opened fire on IDF soldiers. UNIFIL said Israeli soldiers were inside Israeli territory when the border clashes erupted. UNIFIL personnel later visited the site of the skirmish. According to Israeli officials who spoke to UNIFIL representatives, UNIFIL determined that Lebanese forces had no reason to fire on Israeli troops. Milos Strugar, a diplomat and senior political advisor to UNIFIL Force Commander Alberto Asarta said he \\"does not believe IDF soldiers crossed the international border during the maintenance work.\\"Audio + Transcript of Israel Army Radio‚Äôs Interview with UNIFIL Spokesman, Milos Strugar, Aug 4, 2010  Casualties  The casualties of the incident were: *Israeli reserve battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Dov Harari was killed in his observation post when he was shot in the head by a Lebanese sniper. Reserve company commander Captain Ezra Lakia was wounded by Lebanese sniper fire as he stood in the same post, sustaining a gunshot wound to the chest. *Two Lebanese soldiers, Sergeant Robert Elias al Ashi and Sergeant Abdullah Mohammad al Tufaili, were killed in an Israeli helicopter attack on a Lebanese military command center in Al Taybeh several miles from the border. Both soldiers were in an M113 armored personnel carrier when it was hit during the airstrike. Five other Lebanese soldiers were wounded by Israeli retaliatory fire. *Assaf Abu Rahhal, a journalist for Lebanon's Al-Akhbar newspaper, was killed by Israeli artillery fire in Adaisseh, located several miles behind border. *Ali Shuaib, a journalist from the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Manar television station, was moderately wounded in the same artillery attack.  Reactions  = Israel = Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he held the Lebanese government \\"directly accountable for this violent provocation against Israel.\\" He also added that \\"Israel responded aggressively, and will do so in the future against any attempt to violate the quiet on [our] northern border, and attack residents of the north and the soldiers who are protecting them.\\" Defense Minister Ehud Barak warned the Lebanese government against continuing to provoke IDF forces. He added that Israel would not tolerate any attacks on soldiers or citizens within its sovereign territory and also called on the international community to condemn the \\"criminal act carried out by the Lebanese army.\\" He later added that \\"It was a very grave provocation and we reacted in a measured, just and immediate manner. Tuesday's incident was not programmed by the chiefs of staff of the Lebanese army in Beirut or by Hezbollah. I hope there will be no escalation, that we will have a calm summer and that things will return to normal.\\" He also expressed concern that the United States and France had \\"provided sophisticated weapons to Lebanon which were used in Tuesday's incident and could fall into Hezbollah's hands.\\" The Foreign Ministry labeled the incident a \\"severe violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701\\" and only \\"one of many violations of Resolution 1701, the most severe of which is the massive rearmament of Hizbullah, including the rearmament of Hizbullah units in southern Lebanon.\\" It declared, \\"Israel holds the Lebanese government responsible for the grave incident, and warns of the consequences should these continue.\\" Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman \\"instructed the Israeli diplomatic delegation to the United Nations to file a protest with the UN Secretary General and the Security Council.\\" Major General Gadi Eisenkot said \\"It was a planned ambush by a sniper unit ... this was a provocation by the Lebanese army. We view this fire was a highly grave incident. Our forces responded at once, and immediately after that we resorted to artillery and gunship fire.\\" Israel also filed a complaint with the United Nations, alleging that Lebanese soldiers opened fire despite the IDF having informed UNIFIL forces in advance of its plan to cut down a tree along the border fence. Former Israeli Defense minister Shaul Mofaz called the incident a \\"planned terror attack\\" and said he had \\"no doubt that Hizbullah was involved in the Lebanese Army's actions.\\" Mofaz also criticized UNIFIL's involvement, stating that their \\"inability to prevent the Lebanese Army from firing on IDF soldiers proves their incompetence.\\" Israeli sources also alleged that UNIFIL forces said the Lebanese soldiers had no reason to open fire as the Israeli army was conducting routine activity. Government officials in Israel have criticized the United States and France for supporting Lebanon's military in the wake of the border clash. The US has provided Lebanon with over 400 million in military aid, and France has supplied the military with advanced anti-tank missiles. Israeli UN Ambassador Daniel Carmon wrote a letter of complaint to the UN that: \\"These attacks threaten stability, peace, and security in our region. In response to this grave incident that constitutes a blatant violation of UN Security Council resolution 1701, Israel exercised its right of self-defense, responding with the appropriate measures on LAF positions in the area. Israel holds the Government of Lebanon responsible for these attacks and all actions conducted from Lebanese territory. Israel calls upon the international community to exert its influence and to take the necessary measures with the Lebanese authorities to ensure that such provocative violations will not be repeated.\\" Israel's security cabinet called a meeting to discuss \\"the consequences of the attacks for which the Lebanese government is responsible. It is evident that the Lebanese government is doubly responsible: the attack against our soldiers occurred when they were on Israeli territory and it is Lebanese soldiers who opened fire and forced us to respond.\\" According to Lebanese news sources, the Israeli government demanded that Lebanon court-martial the commander of the Lebanese unit that fired at IDF troops across the border.Israel demands LAF court-martial Jerusalem Post, 08/06/2010 = Lebanon = President Michel Suleiman said he would \\"stand up to Israel's violation of Resolution 1701, whatever the price\\". He denounced the clash including the \\"bombing of a Lebanese army checkpoint and attacks on Lebanese property\\" and called for both countries to respect the Blue Line. Prime Minister Saad Hariri called the attack a \\"violation of Lebanese sovereignty and demands.\\" He called for \\"the United Nations and the international community bear their responsibilities and pressure Israel to stop its aggression.\\" Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri called on the government to \\"urgently file a complaint to the Security Council over the violation of Resolution 1701.\\" Minister of Social Affairs Selim el-Sayegh of the Phalange party said \\"The history of the Lebanese army's actions have been defensive ... it is in no position whatsoever to conduct any attack against Israel. It wants only to defend Lebanese territory ... Israel has been doing these activities as a matter of provocation. Lebanese Information Minister Tarek Mitri stated that Lebanon respects the border but contests part of it. He said that while the tree which triggered the confrontation is on the Israeli side of the border, it \\"is Lebanese territory.\\" Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah declared that in the future his group would not \\"stand silent\\" in any future attacks against the LAF and that \\"The Israeli hand that targets the Lebanese army will be cut off. [However] I don't expect a war to happen soon...but there are reasons for worry.\\" He added that \\"We told our militants to hold back, not to do anything. [But] From now on, if the army is attacked in any area where the resistance [Hezbollah] has a presence or a say, we will not stand by idly.\\" He also praised the Lebanese army saying it \\"acted courageously and decisively. Lebanon in its entirety will not consent to attacks on its sacred soil and will fight with full courage.\\" In addition to his support for the army he said \\"We contacted the president and the army command and told them that the party is at their service.\\" The Higher Defence Council chief, General Said Eid, said Lebanon stood ready to confront Israeli aggression \\"by all available means.\\" Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassem said they would be ready to strike the heart of Israel in the event of a new aggression against Lebanon. \\"Israel must understand that any aggression on Lebanon, no matter how small, gives us the complete right to retaliate when and how we find appropriate and in line with Lebanon's political interests. Hezbollah chooses when to be patient and when to retaliate. When Israel threatens to destroy Lebanon, it knows Hezbollah is capable of making Israel suffer properly. Israel's territory will be completely exposed and they will have to bear responsibility for that aggression and pay the price.\\" Maronite Bishops also condemned Israel's \\"aggression\\" and said they were sorry for the Lebanese army victims. Following the Council of Maronite Bishops' monthly meeting, they issued a statement describing the dead as \\"heroic martyrs;\\" they also called on all Lebanese to put their differences aside and \\"focus on what brings them closer together because the country's stability is based on their closeness.\\" A spokesman for the LAF said Lebanon stands ready to retaliate in the event of any new aggression. \\"The answer will be the same in the event of any aggression along the border. Any aggression against Lebanon will have serious consequences.\\" He added that the army was in contact with UNIFIL after Israeli army radio said troops planned to try again to uproot the tree in the border area. The day after the incident Lebanese authorities also arrested a senior member of the opposition bloc's Free Patriotic Movement, Fayez Karam, on suspicion of spying for Israel. After the United States House of Representatives voted to suspend military aid to Lebanon, the Lebanese government stated that it would reject any future U.S. military aid conditioned on Lebanon agreeing not to use it against Israel. = International organizations = The European Union urged restraint from both sides. The head of the United Nations peacekeeping operations Alain le Roy said that UNIFIL \\"established...that the trees being cut by the Israeli army are located south of the Blue Line on the Israeli side,\\" and that the Israeli army gave notification of \\"several hours...by the Israeli authorities of their intention to do this operation, and immediately as procedure we informed the Lebanese side.\\" UNIFIL then asked Israel to delay cutting down the trees in order to \\"facilitate an agreement between the two parties.\\" Though the Israeli army delayed the operation by several hours, le Roy said the UN would have liked a longer delay. UNIFIL Spokesman Neeraj Singh confirmed the firefight and urged both sides to use \\"maximum restraint.\\" He added that \\"UNIFIL peacekeepers are in the area and are trying to ascertain the circumstances of the incident and any possible casualties.

This also gives Nascimento the distinction of being one of the few artists in the Filipino music scene arising originally from the surf community, and whose music is characterized by a \\"surfer vibe.\\" Personal life Nascimento was raised in the town of Agoo, La Union, where he took up his early studies, including High School at the College of Education Laboratory High School of the Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University. He then took his college degree at Saint Louis University in Baguio. After a brief stint elsewhere, he eventually settled down to a life in La Union, where he married Joy Gaerlan, whom he had met in High School. He also pursued studies in culinary arts in Manila. Having developed a passion for cars, he eventually began writing for motoring magazines, and eventually came to host a motoring show for the ABS CBN News Channel. Musical awakening While in California in August 2008, Nascimento figured in a car accident and suffered a concussion. He credits this event for having suddenly triggered his musical side. In a conversation with Philippine music journalist Ricky Lo, he said: > That same night was when I wrote my first song. I knew that day that > something was absolutely different about me. Looking back at this point, I > can't deny that divine intervention was involved. Love, Death, and Everything in Between (2010) Over the course of the next year, Nascimento was able to write about 30 songs, and record thirteen of them in various makeshift studios, with help from friends like Aaron Bradley and indie artist Brandon Wall (a.k.a. Rise Over Me) in California. Nascimento eventually released these songs independently as the album Love, Death, and Everything in Between. =Track list= Tracks on the album include: #Heartbreaker #Limbo (A Love Lost) #What's With The World? #A Long Distance Affair #The Promise #Intertwined (instrumental) #At Fault #Chasing Fire #This High #Nocturnal Desire #The One #Of Stereos and Music Videos #The Promise (acoustic) =Album art= The album art, conceived by Nascimento, was drawn by a California-based comics artist Ramiro Montanez. Nascimento describes the album cover: > It's metaphorical in the sense that it depicts both aspects of my life; > light and darkness. The rough ocean represents the turmoil I've experienced > while the sky and clouds represent the better parts of my life. =Reception= Nascimento's efforts to market the songs caught the attention of indie film director Brian Patrick Lim, who in early 2009 asked him to come up with the main theme for the upcoming film \\"Chasing Fire\\". It also caught the attention of Francis Reyes, who in July 2010 invited Nascimento to guest at his NU107 radio program in the Raw, exposing Nascimento's music to a mainstream audience for the first time and eventually leading to heavier radio airplay, particularly for the track \\"Nocturnal Desire\\". Caught in the Tide (unreleased) In 2013, press reports indicated that Manskee was working on a second album, Caught in the Tide with multi-awarded musician, sound engineer and producer Pat Tirano. A music video for \\"Sea of Stars,\\" was directed by Jako de Leon. The video was shot in Nascimento's native province of La Union and featured local internet celebrity Bogart The Explorer and a virtual who's-who of the Philippine surfing scene, including personalities like Luke Landrigan, Paolo Soler, and Lorraine Hilario. In October 2013, Manskee was among the performers at the 2013 Philippine Ukulele Festival. On January 22, 2014, listeners voted another song \\"Midlife Crisis\\" into the regular playlist or Manila radio station Jam 88.3, which meant that one of the songs from Caught in the Tide would be on a regular mainstream radio playlist even before the album release.

Social security in Finland, or welfare in Finland, is, compared to other countries‚Äô, very comprehensive. In the late 1980s, Finland had one of the world's most advanced welfare systems, one that guaranteed decent living conditions for all Finns. Since then social security has been cut back, but still the system is one of the most comprehensive in the world. Created almost entirely during the first three decades after World War II, the social security system was an outgrowth of the traditional Nordic belief that the state was not inherently hostile to the well-being of its citizens, but could intervene benevolently on their behalf. According to some social historians, the basis of this belief was a relatively benign history that had allowed the gradual emergence of a free and independent peasantry in the Nordic countries and had curtailed the dominance of the nobility and the subsequent formation of a powerful right wing. Finland's history has been harsher than the histories of the other Nordic countries, but not harsh enough to bar the country from following their path of social development.Text from PD source: US Library of Congress: A Country Study: Finland, Library of Congress Call Number DL1012 .A74 1990.  History  In the last years of the nineteenth century, Finnish social policy had as its goal a lessening of class friction. The few existing pieces of social legislation addressed the needs of specific groups rather than of society as a whole. After the Finnish Civil War in 1918, little was accomplished in welfare legislation, except the \\"Tenant Farmer Law\\" (Torpparilaki, Torparlagen), which gave tenant farmers the possibility to buy the land they used and thus get a more secure living. A woefully insufficient national pension plan was set up in 1937, as were measures to aid mothers in need. It was only after World War II that Finnish social policy acquired the characteristics that in the next decades made it similar to other Nordic systems of social welfare. According to Finnish sociologist Erik Allardt, the hallmark of the Nordic welfare system was its comprehensiveness. Unlike the welfare systems of the United States or most West European countries, those of the Nordic countries cover the entire population, and they are not limited to those groups unable to care for themselves. Examples of this universality of coverage are national flat-rate pensions available to all once they reached a certain age, regardless of what they had paid into the plan, and national health plans based on medical needs rather than on financial means. In addition, the citizens of the Nordic countries have a legal right to the benefits provided by their welfare systems, the provisions of which were designed to meet what was perceived as a collective responsibility to ensure everyone a decent standard of living. The Nordic system also is distinguished by the many aspects of people's lives it touched upon. A \\"municipal home\\" for those unable to provide for themselves in Haapaj√§rvi in pre-war Finland. The receivers of this public service, a precursor to modern social security, included many of the elderly, as private pensions were very uncommon, disabled, single parents, unemployed and their families. The Finnish welfare system differs from those of other Nordic countries mainly in that its benefits are lower in some categories, such as sickness and unemployment payments; otherwise, the Finnish system fit into the Nordic conception of social welfare. Finnish social expenditures constituted about 7 percent of the country's gross domestic product in 1950, roughly equal to what Sweden, Denmark, and Norway were spending. By the mid-1980s, Finland's social expenditures had risen to about 24 percent of GDP, compared with the other countries' respective 35, 30, and 22 percent. Less than 10 percent of these expenditures was paid for by Finnish wage earners; the remainder came roughly equally from the state and from employers. Until the second half of the 1970s, Finnish employers had paid a higher share of social outlays than had their counterparts in the other Nordic countries. In response to the slowdown of the world economy after 1973, there was some shifting of social burdens to the state, which made Finnish companies more price competitive abroad. Finland's welfare system also differed from those of its neighbors in that it was put in place slightly later than theirs, and it was only fully realized in the decade after the formation of the Red-Earth government in 1966 (the Social Democrat - agrarian Centre Party coalition government).Manuel Alvarez Rivera, \\"Election Resources on the Internet: Elections to the Finnish Eduskunta (Parliament)\\" http://electionresources.org/fi/ Just after World War II, the Finns directed their attention to maternal and child care. In 1957 the government established an improved national pension plan and supplemented it in the early 1960s with private pension funds. Unemployment aid was organized in 1959 and in 1960, and it was reformed in 1972. Legislation of the 1950s and the 1960s also mandated the construction of a network of hospitals, the education of more medical personnel, and, from 1963 to the early 1970s, the establishment of a system of health insurance. The housing allowance system expanded during the 1960s to reach ever-widening circles of the population. Health-care officials turned away from hospital care in the 1970s, and they began to emphasize the use of smaller local clinics. By the 1980s, the Finnish welfare system was up to Nordic standards and had the support of most Finns. All major political parties were committed to maintaining it, and its role in Finnish society seemed secure for the coming decades. At 2017 year-end, the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (KELA) provided refunds of medical expenses for 3,764,362 persons and child refunds for 1,003,635 persons as well as 643,153 pensions, 268,537 disability benefits and 286,630 sickness allowances  Organization  In the late 1980s, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health directed the welfare system through five departments: social insurance, social welfare, health care, temperance and alcohol policy, and labor. According to Finland's administrative tradition, it is the task of a ministry and its departments to determine policy, which is then administered by central boards. In the case of social policy, there were three central boards for social welfare, health, and labor protection. An exception to this administrative division was the Social Security Institute, which supervised the national pension plan and health insurance for the Eduskunta and the Council of State. The actual supplier of social care is usually the local government‚Äî-the municipality‚Äî-supervised by authorities at the provincial level. In the early 1980s, funds from the state made up about 30 percent of the monies spent on all social services and pensions, while employers supplied about 40 percent; local governments, 15 percent; and the recipients of services, the remainder.  Income security programmes classified as social insurance  Social Insurance Institution (KELA) in Espoo. Its original function was as the provider of national retirement benefits. Later its functions have been expanded to include unemployment insurance and student grants among other things. Finland, like the other Nordic countries, divides most of its social programmes into those that guarantee income security and those that provide social and health services. Income security programmes come in two categories: social insurance, which provides income despite old age, illness, pregnancy, unemployment, or work-related injuries; and income security classified as welfare, which consists of income transfers to aid families through measures such as child payments, maternity grants, payments to war victims and their survivors, and financial aid to those afflicted by disability or pressing needs. Programs of the first category, income security guarantees, take some 80 percent of the funds expended for social welfare. =National pension plan= Finland's first national old-age pension plan dates from 1937, but it was so poorly funded that a new National Pensions Act was put into effect in 1957. In the late 1980s, this law, somewhat reformed, was still the basis of Finland's National Pension Plan, which was open to all residents over the age of sixteen, even to those who had never paid into it. Even those foreigners not from the Nordic countries were entitled to this pension if they had resided in Finland for at least five years. Those who left for residence in a country outside Nordic Europe, even those who were Finnish citizens, could receive the pension for only one year. The flat-rate national pension could be paid as an old-age pension, once a person reached the age of sixty five; as an invalidity pension (either full or partial) to those between the ages of sixteen and sixty-four who were no longer able to work; or, in some cases, to the long-term unemployed who were in their late fifties or early sixties. In addition to these classes of beneficiaries, survivors of those eligible for national pensions who were not themselves eligible for the pensions could receive pensions under the terms of the Survivor's Pension Plan. Also tied to the National Pension Plan were payments for handicapped children living at home and for some combat veterans of World War II. Payments of the national pension are uniform for everyone. To this amount were added the assistance payment, which varied according to a pensioner's marital status, the cost of living in his or her locality, and other pensions that he or she received. Other supplementary payments could be made for dependent children, for degree of disability, and for housing costs, as well as for veterans of the Civil War and of World War II. National pensions are indexed, and they increase in value each year. Since reforms of the early 1980s, national pensions became non-taxable if they were the sole source of income. Pensions were no longer affected by a spouse's earnings or pension income, and the national pension could only be reduced by income from other pensions. The National Pension Plan was funded by the beneficiary's own contributions, about 2 percent of his or her locally taxable income, and by employer contributions of 4 to 5 percent of the insured person's wages. =Employee pension plans= The Employees' Pensions Act was passed in 1961 to supplement the National Pension Plan which, while adequate for Finns living in the countryside‚Äìa majority of the population until the 1960s‚Äìdid not provide enough benefits for city dwellers. During the next decade, other compulsory wage-related pension plans were enacted into law for temporary employees, for national and local government employees, for those working for a state church, and for the self- employed. At the end of the decade, a supplementary plan was created for farmers as well. Seamen had had an income-based plan since 1956, and, as of 1986, those active in freelance professions such as acting and writing also obtained coverage. These employment pension plans were completely funded by the employers, private or public, who paid contributions, equal on the average to about 10 percent of a worker's earnings, into funds managed by seven large insurance companies or who set up funds on their own. Self-employed persons had to choose a fund. The Central Pension Security Institute was responsible for keeping records about employment and benefits. The normal age of pensionable retirement was sixty-five, and the pension paid was based on the average earnings one had received in the last four years of work ending two years before retirement. One could receive up to 60 percent of private-sector earnings and up to 66 percent of public-sector earnings. Older employees, at work before these pension plans became effective, were guaranteed a minimum pension of at least 29 percent if they retired before 1975, and 37 percent if they retired after this date. Like the national pension, wage-related pensions were indexed, and they increased each year. In addition, there were provisions relating to disability, early or late retirement, and survivors' benefits similar to those in effect for the National Pension Plan. =Sickness insurance= The Sickness Insurance Act of 1963 introduced health insurance to Finland in two stages. First, beginning in 1964 it provided payments when wages were lost because of illness or maternity leave and payments for the cost of treatment and medicine. Three years later, it began paying doctors' bills as well. Until the act went into effect, only a small minority of the population, generally those employed by large firms, had medical insurance. All persons resident in Finland for more than a short time were eligible for benefits. Foreigners had to register with the local health authorities to receive payments. In the 1980s, the daily payment made to make up for losses of income due to illness averaged about 80 percent of a typical wage and could last for as many as 300 workdays. Highly paid individuals received less. Hospital care in public hospitals was generally free, and other compensation amounted to 60 percent of doctors' fees, 75 percent of laboratory expenses, and 50 percent of medicine costs. In the mid-1980s, dental care was free for anyone born after 1961, but for others it was paid only if dental problems had to be treated to cure a disease. Maternity leave payments amounted to about 80 percent of income for about one year, and could begin five weeks before the estimated date of the birth. Fathers could take some of this time, with a corresponding cut in the days allowed to the mother. Sickness insurance was funded by the recipients themselves through their payment of about two percent of their locally taxable income, by employers who paid a contribution of about one percent of the employee's wages, and by the state. However generous these benefits appeared in an international context, medical fees had increased in the 1970s and the 1980s, and government compensation rates had not kept pace. Rates increased by 25 percent in 1986, but not enough according to some critics. Those who pressed for government relief believed it necessary even though public medical care, which constituted the bulk of medical care in Finland, was already highly subsidized and hence rather cheap compared with many other countries. =Unemployment insurance= The Unemployment Security Act of 1984 reformed the unemployment assistance system that had been gradually worked out to deal with the persistent problem of unemployment in Finland. The act arranged for coverage of all unemployed between the ages of seventeen and sixty-four, resident in Finland, whose income came from wages earned doing work for another person or legal entity. A person had to be in need to receive payments under the terms of the act and could be disqualified because of a spouse's earnings. The self-employed, full-time students, and people receiving pensions or maternity allowances were not eligible, nor were those who were unemployed because of illness, injury, or handicap, or who had quit work voluntarily, who had lost work because of labor disputes, or who had refused to accept employment. Those eligible for unemployment benefits receive them in two ways. A basic daily allowance of about 25 ‚Ç¨ goes to any person looking for employment. This allowance was means-tested, and the income of a spouse could disqualify a potential beneficiary. The allowance lasts as long as the recipient is unemployed. Those unemployed who are members of an unemployment fund (about 80 percent of Finns are) and who have worked for at least 26 weeks in the preceding 2 years are eligible for more substantial benefits amounting to the daily basic allowance plus 45 percent of the difference between their daily wage and the basic allowance. After 100 days the payment is reduced by 20 percent. Beneficiaries of the income-related allowance could receive it for 500 days in a four-year period. Workers in their late fifties and older who had been unable to find work can be granted an unemployment pension equal to a disability pension until they reached the age when they would be eligible for an old-age pension. Unemployment benefits are administered by the Social Security Institute. The basic allowance is completely financed by the state. Employers and the state fund equal shares of 95 percent of the income-related payments and the beneficiary is responsible for the remaining five percent. As of the end of 2017, Finland has paid out more than ‚Ç¨4,491 million of unemployment benefits to 369,100 persons, by so providing financial support for 11% of Finnish population between 18 and 64. According to surveys, Finnish citizens generally favor the implementation of universal basic income: in September 2015, the positive attitude towards basic income was shared by 69 percent of respondents. Since the first day of January 2017, the Basic Income Experiment, which requires a ‚Ç¨560 unconditional monthly payment for 2000 randomly chosen unemployed Finnish citizens, was launched for the 2017-2018 period. The payment is roughly equal to the average Finnish unemployment benefit; it does not affect the other social security benefits and is being paid even if a recipient becomes employed. The experiment is organized by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (KELA) and supervised by Olli Kangas, the head of its Research Department. On April 2018, the government rejected the call for Basic Income Experiment's extra funding; the results of the project will be announced at the end of 2020. =Worker's compensation= An employee who suffers work-related injuries is financially protected through payments that covered medical and rehabilitation expenses and fully match his or her wages. If injuries resulted in permanent disability, the worker can receive payments amounting to 85 percent of his or her wages for total disability. Survivors are eligible for pensions, as well as a sizable funeral grant. This compulsory programme is entirely funded by the employer. Income security classified as welfare In addition to the above benefits that are classified as income security in the form of social insurance, there are income security programs classified as welfare. One of the differences between the two classes of social programs is that the welfare measures are financed mostly through taxes, whereas social insurance programs are paid for by employers and employees. This second category of income security also consists of payments to those eligible. The most important and expensive class of these benefits involves payments to families with children. Other programs assist those who have suffered war injuries and their dependents, provide financial aid to those called up for military service and to their families, make payments to the handicapped that help them earn their living, and provide living allowances that are the last resort of those unable to earn their way. =Family Aid= thumb300pxAid to families takes many forms. All parents receive information, support, health and parenting advice, vaccinations and such before and after the child's birth from the state-run child health clinics. They also monitor the physical, mental and social condition of children and gather data for public health purposes. Financial aid to families with children comes in the form of child allowances, child care and maintenance allowances, and maternity benefits. Child allowances dated from the 1930s, and they were one of the oldest part s of the welfare system. The law in force in the late 1980s was the Child Allowance Act of 1948, which arranged for payments to parents for all children under the age of sixteen and resident in Finland, regardless of the wealth or nationality of the parents. Child-care allowances had been paid since the 1970s to those parents who stayed at home to care for small children or who had engaged someone else to do so. A child maintenance allowance is paid when a court- ordered maintenance payment for a child of divorced parents was not being paid. A maternity benefit, based on legislation of the 1930s, was paid for each pregnancy. It came either as a grant or as a much more valuable set of materials, the maternity package, needed to tend a child. It was withheld if the mother did not visit a clinic by the fifth month of pregnancy. =Welfare services= In addition to the above measures that involve financial payments to achieve social ends, the system of social care provides welfare services. By the mid-1980s, some 90,000 state and local employees were using about five percent of Finland's gross national product to deliver a wide variety of social services under the overall direction of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. The expansion of the welfare system in the 1960s and the 1970s had caused the number of social workers roughly to triple between 1970 and 1985. Since 1981 workers entering the field had been required to have university training. National government subsidies of from 30 to 60 percent of costs had the goal of making social services uniform throughout the country, so that residents of even the most isolated community had the same range of services as were offered in Helsinki, though this aim was not always met. Social services were usually free, and they were available to anyone who wanted them, irrespective of the recipient's income. Information furnished to social workers was confidential and could not be released, even to another government agency. The ultimate aim of welfare services was to increase the quality of life and the independence of the client so that welfare services were no longer needed. The Social Welfare Act of 1982 replaced some older laws; it charged local government with providing such social services as general and family counseling and with making housing available to those needing it, most notably the aged and the infirm, troubled youth, and alcoholics. The law detailed local responsibilities for assigning specialists to assist persons living at home but no longer fully able to take care of themselves and for maintaining institutions for persons, be they aged, mentally handicapped, or addicted, whose afflictions were so serious that they could no longer live at home. =Child-Care services= Publicly run cr√®ches/daycare centres are available, by law, to all Finnish families. They charge relatively low fees, also based on law. Availability of quality day care (the staff are university- educated in early childhood education) has allowed the female population to pursue careers more commonly than in other parts of the world. A law with far- reaching effects was the 1973 Child Day Care Act, which stipulated that all local governments were to provide good child day care for all families that desired it. The care for children up to seven years of age could be given either in cr√®che/daycare centres, sometimes private but generally run by local governments, or by accredited baby-sitters, either at the child's home or outside it. Although the number of places for day care had more than doubled to 100,000 by the mid-1980s, it would have had to double again to meet total needs. A 1985 law set the goal of being able to allow, by 1990, all parents of children up to the age of three the choice between home-care payments or a place for their child in a cr√®che/daycare centre. One parent could also take unpaid employment leave until the child's third birthday. The Child Welfare Act of 1983 enjoined local governments to look after children, and it empowered them to take a variety of measures if a child was being seriously neglected or abused. In the mid-1980s, about 2 percent of Finnish children were affected by this law. Another 1983 law made the corporal punishment of children illegal, as it was in the other Nordic countries. =Services for the disabled= The Welfare of the Disabled Act of 1946 set the responsibilities for treatment of the physically handicapped. The institutions that offered housing, occupational training, sheltered working environments, and physical rehabilitation were overseen by the National Board of Social Welfare, while about a score of schools for handicapped children unable to attend ordinary schools was supervised by the National Board of Schools. Special equipment, like prostheses, was supplied at no cost, as were such services as the adaptation of living areas. In the late 1980s, there were some 30,000 mentally handicapped Finns, 10,000 of whom received welfare ranging from living accommodations in an institution to day-center care or jobs in sheltered workshops. There were not enough places to accommodate all the mentally disabled properly, so some were placed in private homes or in retirement homes. =Services for substance abusers= The Welfare for Intoxicant Abusers Act of 1985 dealt mainly with alcoholism, as it was the only serious problem of substance abuse in Finland in the late 1980s. Finnish society had traditionally not seen alcohol as a part of daily life, but rather as something consumed on special occasions and then to the point of intoxication. Medical evidence of this harmful habit was that the Finnish incidence of death by acute alcohol poisoning was seven times that of Sweden and twenty times that of Denmark. Because of its troubled relationship with alcohol, the country enforced prohibition from 1919 to 1931. A later measure against alcohol consumption was a 1976 law that banned liquor advertisements in most publications. Another measure increased the cost of alcohol by taxing it heavily, so much so that by the mid-1980s liquor taxes were an important out source of state revenues. In the 1980s, there were still many abstainers in Finland who had moral objections to alcohol use, in contrast to the small minority of drinkers who accounted for more than half of total national consumption. In the late 1960s, a relaxation of the rules for the purchase of alcohol had as its goal a lessening of drink's glamorous appeal because it was, in a sense, forbidden. This policy may have backfired when sales of beer in grocery stores and the availability of hard liquor at more restaurants caused alcohol consumption to more than double within a decade. Since the mid-1970s, however, analysts of Finnish alcohol use have seen consumption rates level off and drinking habits become more moderate. Although the number of abstainers had dropped sharply in the postwar period, causing some sociologists to refer to Finns who became adults in the 1950s and the 1960s as \\"the wet generation,\\" alcohol was gradually coming to take a more ordinary place in everyday life. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health had a special department concerned with substance abuse, the Department of Temperance and Alcohol Policy, that formulated welfare plans and directed the State Alcohol Monopoly responsible for the manufacture, importation, and sale of alcohol. Local authorities provided a variety of facilities for alcoholics‚Äîincluding clinics, half-way houses, and emergency housing open twenty-four hours a day that offered withdrawal treatments. When necessary, alcoholics could be confined against their will, but this practice was less common in the late 1980s than it had been previously. State welfare was supplemented by private and voluntary associations, such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Health system The University Hospital of Tampere serves the second most populous metropolitan area in Finland. University hospitals and central hospitals administer more demanding forms of health care to patients from around the surrounding region. They are all publicly run and charge little or nothing from the patients, instead receiving their funding from the state and the municipalities. By the second half of the 1980s, Finns enjoyed a standard of health fully comparable to that of other highly developed countries. If health standards did not match those of Finland's Nordic neighbors in all areas, it was because Sweden, Denmark, and Norway were the world's leaders in health care. Finland had made remarkable progress, however, and was rapidly catching up. In one major area, the prevention of infant mortality, Finland led the world in the mid-1980s: it had the world's lowest infant mortality rate. =Development of the health system= Since becoming an independent state in 1917, Finland has managed to deal with the \\"traditional\\" health problems. The most important cause of death in the nineteenth century, pulmonary tuberculosis, was brought under control by means of a network of tuberculosis hospitals built between the world wars. Smallpox and pneumonia have also ceased to be serious problems. With the aid of the vaccination law passed in 1952, the fight against communicable diseases was largely won. In 1980, for example, there were no deaths from common diseases of this type. By the mid-1980s, no cases of diphtheria had been registered in Finland for several decades, and, with the exception of a mini-epidemic of seven cases in 1983-84, poliomyelitis also had disappeared. An emphasis on hospital construction in the 1950s and 1960s brought the ratio of hospital beds per capita up to international norms, and new medical training centers more than doubled the number of physicians between 1970 and the mid-1980s. The passage of the Sickness Insurance Act in 1963 and frequent expansion of its coverage meant that good medical care was available to everyone. Later legislative measures, such as the Primary Health Care Act of 1972, or the Mental Health Act of 1978, aimed at moving health care from large centers, increasing the amount of preventive treatment at smaller local facilities, and favoring out-patient care when possible. Finnish health authorities believed, even in the late 1980s, that care of this kind could be more flexible, humane, and effective and could also check cost increases. Despite this policy innovation, however, social expenditures on health had increased ten-fold in real terms since the early 1950s. =Organization of the health system= Health care is directed by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and administered by the National Board of Health. In accordance with government practices, the ministry decides policy, and the national board determines how it will be administered. Actual delivery of care is the responsibility of local government, especially after the Primary Health Care Act of 1972, which stipulated that the basis of medical treatment should be the care offered in local health clinics. Previously, the emphasis had been on care from large regional hospitals. The 1972 law resulted in the creation of about 200 local health centers each of which served a minimum of 10,000 persons. As municipalities varied greatly in size, small ones had to unite with others to form health centers, while about half the centers were operated by a single municipality. Centers did not necessarily consist of a single building, but encompassed all the health facilities in the health center district. With the exception of some sparsely settled regions, people were usually within twenty- five kilometers of the center charged with their care. A basic aim of the 1972 law was to give all Finns equal access to health care, regardless of their income or where they lived. Because most services of health centers were free, subsidies from the national government were required to augment the financial resources of municipalities. The subsidies varied according to the wealth of the municipality and ranged roughly from 30 to 65 percent of costs. By the mid-1980s, about 40 percent of the money spent on health went for primary care, compared with 10 percent in 1972. Health care centers were responsible for routine care such as health counseling, examinations, and screening for communicable diseases; they also provided school health services, home care, dental work, and child and maternal care. Most health centers had at least three physicians and additional staff at a ratio of about eleven per physician. Because of the high level of their training, nurses performed many services done by physicians in other countries. Most centers had midwives, whose high competence, combined with an extensive program of prenatal care, made possible Finland's extremely low infant mortality rate, the world's best at 6.5 deaths per 1,000 births. Once it was established that a health problem could not be treated adequately at a center, patients were directed to hospitals, either to one of about thirty local hospitals with some degree of specialization, or to one of about twenty hospitals, five of which were university teaching hospitals, that could offer highly specialized care. In addition, there were institutions with a single concern, such as the sixty psychiatric hospitals, and others that dealt with orthopedics, epilepsy, rheumatism, or plastic surgery. Given the great drop in the incidence of tuberculosis in Finland, the country's dozen sanatoria were gradually being taken over for other purposes. Hospitals were usually operated by federations of municipalities, as their maintenance was beyond the power of most single municipalities. By the mid-1980s, the country's public hospitals had about 50,000 beds, and its 40-odd private hospitals had roughly 3,000. There were another 20,000 beds for patients at health centers, homes for the elderly, and other welfare institutions. The Social Insurance Institution of Finland (KELA) is concerned with the reimbursement system for licensed doctors' work. Reimbursements can also cover the part of diagnostics and private-sector healthcare treatments, such as dental services.

Fricker (Verlag VEXER, 1989) and Renaud Siegmann's Mail Art, Art postal - Art post√©.Mail Art, Art postal - Art post√©, Renaud Siegmann (√âditions Alternatives, 2002) In the past three decades he has organized many exhibitions, events, publications and collective projects in the fields of mail art, audio art, visual poetry, underground comics and street art, including 100 issues of Arte Postale! mail art magazine. He was the originator of formative networking projects such as the TRAX modular system (1981‚Äì1987), the multiple names Lieutenant Murnau and Luther Blissett, the Stickerman project and F.U.N. (Funtastic United Nations, since 2001). He is based in Viareggio, Italy.  Mail Art and Arte Postale!  Vittore Baroni was introduced to the mail art network in 1977 through Guglielmo Achille Cavellini, and instantly became heavily involved, participating every year in dozens of international projects and shows. From 1979 he organized a series of Mail Art exhibitions for the Forte dei Marmi Town Library and published the first issue of his enduring magazine Arte Postale! During the summer of 1995 there was a retrospective exhibition of all Arte Postale! magazines (1979-1995) in Guy Bleus' E-Mail Art Archives in the provincial Centre for Arts (now Art Museum Z33) in Hasselt, Belgium.Retrospective II: Arte Postale! (1979-1995), Guy Bleus, Programmatiebrochure, Begijnhof, Centre for Arts, Hasselt, Belgium, Summer 1995, p.10 In 1992 he created, with Piermario Ciani, the Stickerman Museum devoted to all forms of adhesive art. In addition to writing the influential books, Arte Postale, guida al network della corrispondenza creativa (1997) and Postcarts ‚Äì Cartoline d‚Äôartista (2005), he also edited the books Rubber Stamp Art by John Held Jr. (1999) and Artistamps by James Warren Felter (2002) In 2000, Baroni was Curator of the Mail Art section for a large retrospective exhibition on the art avant-gardes of the 20th century, Sentieri Interrotti at the Museo d'Arte Moderna of Bassano del Grappa. He is co-founder of the cultural association BAU in Viareggio. He has also conceived and coordinated several major international networking projects ‚Äì * IM98: A Year Of Incongruous Meetings (1998). * The F.U.N.

A boxed set of the complete collection of Arte Postale! was acquired by the Mart Museum in Rovereto in 2010.  Music and Audio  Baroni has produced and published audio works since 1980 when he began recording under the pseudonym Lieutenant Murnau. The following year he founded, with Piermario Ciani, the international multimedia group TRAX to producing magazines, cassettes, records, t-shirts and live shows, and in 1991 he joined the musical project Le Forbici di Manit√π which continues to release CD editions. He is also a prodigious music journalist. In 1982 he became a staff writer for the rock monthly Rockerilla, in 1989 he contributed to the monumental Enciclopedia Rock Anni ‚Äô80 by Arcana Editrice, and in 1992 he co- founded, with Claudio Sorge and Alberto Campo, the monthly rock magazine Rumore. Lieutenant Murnau Lieutenant Murnau was invented as the name of a ‚Äúghost musical group‚Äù. It was started in 1980 and ended in 1984. The image the group used came from a photograph of film director Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau while serving as a lieutenant in the German army. This photograph was taken and reproduced on to posters, leaflets, fanzines, badges and all other memorabilia of pop mythology to create an interest in something that did not exist. Lt. Murnau managed to produce various records and cassettes without Baroni playing a single note, simply releasing mixages of recorded music. The \\"Meet Lt. Murnau\\" tape, for example, was a deliberate confusion of Beatles and The Residents records. He also used soundtracks of F.W. Murnau's films and music provided by other groups in hommage to Murnau. To mess up things even more, he had some of these tapes and records released in different countries by different people. Lt. Murnau also appeared on stage, masked, mixing different records and crucifying a Beatles LP. Hundreds of life-size Lt. Murnau-cardboard masks were printed which people could wear. Anybody could make Lt. Murnau music and become Lt. Murnau, and a few people did it. The whole project was focussed on a very limited idea, that of underground music, and did not have the broader implications of the Monty Cantsin or Luther Blissett multiple user name philosophy.

Dref yarns are bulky, with low tensile strength making them suitable for blankets and mop yarns, they can be spun from asbestos, carbon fibres and make filters was water systems. Yarns such as Rayon and Kevlar can be spun using this method. The technology was developed around 1975 by Dr. Ernst Fehrer. Spinning technologies There are three current technologies used today for spinning fibres: #Roving spinning which uses the legacy ring -spinning technology of the twentieth century, #Open end, Rotor or Break Spinning used for high quality threads #Dref friction spinning for other yarns. Friction spinning is the fastest of all these techniques though the yarn is irregular and bulkier, making it suitable only for some applications. Yarn formation in friction spinning system The mechanism of yarn formation consists of three distinct operations: feeding of fibres, fibre integration and twist insertion. =Feeding= The individual fibres are transported by air currents and deposited in the spinning zone. The mode of fibre feed has a particular effect on fibre extent and fibre configuration in yarn and on its properties. There are two methods of fibre feed: *Direct feed The fibres are fed directly onto the rotating fibre mass that outer part of the yarn tail. *Indirect feed. The fibres are first accumulated on the in-going roll and then transferred to the yarn tail. =Fibres integration= The fibres assembles through a feed tube onto a yarn core/tail within the shear field, is provided by two rotating spinning drums and the yarn core is in between them. The shear causes sheath fibres to wrap around the yarn core. The fibre orientation is highly dependent on the decelerating fibres arriving at the assembly point through the turbulent flow. The fibres in the friction drum have two probable methods for integration of incoming fibres to the sheath. One method, the fibre assembles completely on to perforated drum before their transfer to the rotating sheath. In the other method, fibres are laid directly on to rotating sheath. =Twist insertion= There has been much research on the twisting process in friction spinning. In friction spinning, the fibres are applied twist with more or less one at a time without cyclic differentials in tension in the twisting zone. Therefore, fibre migration may not take place in friction spun yarns. The mechanism of twist insertion for core type friction spinning and open end friction spinning are different, which are described below. Twist insertion in core-type friction spinning In core type friction spinning, the core, made of a filament or a bundle of staple fibres, is false twisted by the spinning drum. The sheath fibres are deposited on the false twisted core surface and are wrapped helically over the core with varying helix angles. It is believed that the false twist in the core gets removed once the yarn is emerged from the spinning drums, so that this yarn has a virtually twist-less core. However, it is quite possible for some amount of false twist to remain in the fact that the sheath entraps it during yarn formation in the spinning zone. Twist insertion in open end type friction spinning In open end type friction spinning the fibres in the yarn are integrated as a stacked cone. The fibres in the surface of the yarn found more compact and good packing density than the axial fibres in the yarn. The yarn tail can be considered as a loosely constructed conical mass of fibres, formed at the nip of the spinning drums. It is of very porous and lofty structure. The fibres rotating at very high speed. History Dr. Ernst Fehrer (1919-2001) invented and patented the DREF friction spinning process in 1973. He had begun work on the development of this alternative to mule, ring and rotor open end spinning with the objective of surmounting the physico- mechanical limits on capacity in yarn engineering, enhancing the production speeds. The system was name using letters from his honorific and name. His company Dr. Ernst Fehrer AG, Textilmaschinenfabrik, was based in Linz- Leonding, Austria. He died in December 2000 at age 81 having produced more than 1000 patents. Fehrer began his career in research, development and inventing at age 14 writing his first patent at 18. He developed a high-speed needle loom with counterbalancing technology as well as the \\"DREF\\"system. In 1988, Fehrer received the TAPPI Nonwovens Division Award for his contributions to nonwovens manufacturing technology, and in 1994 Fehrer received Textile World's first Lifetime Achievement Award.Obituary =Development= The Dref I was in development in 1975; a three-head machine, and in 1977 the first DREF 2 for the coarse yarn count range came onto the market. In view of its success, Dr. Fehrer then created the DREF 3, which was designed for the medium yarn count range and made its debut at the ITMA ‚Äô79 in Hanover, before entering serial production in 1981. New generations of the DREF 2 followed in 1986 and 1994 and the DREF 3/96 was launched at the ITMA in Milan. The 1999 ITMA in Paris witnessed the arrival of the DREF 2000, the first of which was sold prior to the fair. Full production of the DREF 2000 commenced in the autumn of 1999 in co-ordination with presentations at the ATME, USA and the SIMAT in Argentina. In 2001, the DREF 2000 also went on display in Asia at the ITMA Singapore and in Central America at the EXINTEX, Mexico. Fehrer entered co- operations with professional textile companies to develop the technology; Rieter AG in Switzerland and Oerlikon Schlafhorst in Germany. With this co- operation the last machine developed by DREF was the DREF 3000, which was available for testing in the new facility in Linz, Austria in 2001. Saurer AG purchased Fehrer AG in 2005. DREFCORP, along with all its associated patents and intellectual property was purchased in 2007 by Nordin Technologies ‚Äì a Malaysian company ‚Äì that continues to develop and manufacture DREF 2000 and DREF 3000 machines as well as continuing to serve the international market with parts for the original Fehrer Dref II, Dref III, Dref 2000 and Dref 3000 friction spinning machines.http://www.drefcorp.com/ Yarn properties Friction spun yarns DREF yarns have bulky appearance (100-140% bulkier than the ring spun yarns). The twist is not uniform and found with loopy yarn surface. Friction spun yarns with a high %age of core have a high stiffness. Friction spun yarns are usually weak as compared to other yarns. The yarns possess only 60% of the tenacity of ring-spun yarns and about 90% of rotor spun-yarns. The increased twist and wrapping of the sheath over the core improve the cohesion between the core and sheath and within the sheath. The breaking elongation ring, rotor and friction spun yarns have been found to be equal. Better relative tenacity efficiency is achieved during processing of cotton on rotor and friction spinning as compared to ring spinning system. Depending on the type of fibre, the differences in strength of these yarns differ in magnitude. It has been reported that 100% polyester yarns, this strength deficiency is 32% whereas for 100% viscose yarns, it ranges from 0-25%. On the other hand, in polyester-cotton blend, DREF yarns perform better than their ring-spun counterparts. A 70/30% blend yarn has been demonstrated to be superior in strength by 25%. The breaking strength of ring yarns to be maximum followed by the rotor yarn and then 50/50 core-sheath DREF-3 yarn. DREF yarns have been seen to be inferior in terms of unevenness, imperfections, strength variability and hairiness. DREF yarns occupy an intermediate position between ring-spun and rotor spun yarns as far as short hairs and total hairiness s concerned. For hairs longer than 3mm, the friction spun yarns are more hairy than the ring spun yarns. Rotor spun yarns show the least value in both the values. DREF yarns are most irregular in terms of twist and linear density while ring spun yarns are most even. Textile technologists have studied the frictional behaviour of ring, rotor, friction spun yarns of 59 and 98.4 Tex spun from cotton, polyester, viscose fibres, with varying levels of twist. The yarn to yarn and yarn to guide roller friction was measured at different sliding speeds and tension ratios. However, for polyester fibres, the rotor spun yarn showed highest friction, followed by friction and ring spun yarns. =Advantages of friction spinning system= The forming yarn rotates at high speed compare to other rotating elements. It can spin yarn at very high twist insertion rates (ie.300,000 twist/min). The yarn tension is practically independent of speed and hence very high production rates (up to 300 m/min) can be attainable. The yarns are bulkier than rotor yarns. The DREF II yarns are used in many applications. Blankets for the home application range, hotels and military uses etc. DREF fancy yarns used for the interior decoration, wall coverings, draperies and filler yarn.

It is located on /, next to the Mont des Arts, in central Brussels. This archive repository holds over of archives.  Deposits  The National Archives preserves the archives of the central institutions of the Burgundian Netherlands, the Spanish Netherlands and the Austrian Netherlands until 1795, of the central public authorities of the French period (1795‚Äì1815) and of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815‚Äì1830). It also holds the archives of the central institutions of the national, and later federal government, from the foundation of Belgium (1830) until today, except for the archives of the Ministries of Defense and of Foreign Affairs. Among the preserved archives are: * The archives of the government bodies and collateral colleges (Council of State, Privy Council, Council of Finance) and the archives of their legal successors (Royal Council of Philip V, Council of the General Government under Joseph II). * The archives of the Court of Accounts. * The archives of the secretariat that assisted the governor general and the government councils (Audience, Secretariat of State and War, German Secretariat of State). * The subordinate offices created during the Austrian period to disengage the collateral councils from a given issue (Junta for Repayment, Jesuit Committee, Committee of the Religion Exchequer, etc.) * The archives of the Courts of Justice: Great Council of Mechelen, Council of Troubles, etc. * The archives of the Creation of Brussels Park and the Royal Square, of the House of Charles of Lorraine, of the Bureau of the Works of the Court, etc. Beside the public archives, the National Archives also preserves numerous private archives such as the archives of politicians who entrusted their records to the institution. The richness of those archives is also due to the sometimes voluminous archives of the most influential Belgian families handed over to the National Archives: * The archives of the Houses of Arenberg, Merode, Ursel, etc. Also worth mentioning: * The cultural archives: records of the administration of the Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie (Brussels, 1771‚Äì1816), etc. * The maps, plans, prints, manuscripts. * Over two million individual files on foreigners, created as from 1839 when the ('Public Safety Office') was charged with the control of all foreigners on Belgian territory. * The collection of seal moulds (second-largest collection in the world). * The digital documents (church registers) accessible via the digital reading room. * Various publications mainly about the history of Belgium and in particular the history of Brabant, but also series of print sources: pamphlets, edicts and old ordinances, specialist journals and books on archival sciences, inventories of the archives preserved in other repositories in Belgium and abroad. The National Archives is equipped with a reading room for the public. Researchers, historians, students, people interested in local and family history, etc. can consult the available documents while respecting the privacy of certain information. A number of exhibitions aimed at valorising the collections are organised in the entry hall and accessible to the public for free. Colloquia and study days are held on a regular basis for a learned public. The National Archives also houses the national coordination services of the institution.  Digital reading room  Some church registers from all over Belgium and an increasing number of civil status registers not older than 100 years can be viewed as digital images in the 19 reading rooms of the State Archives, including the reading room of the National Archives. Furthermore, researchers and victims of Nazi persecution or their relatives can consult, upon request and under certain conditions, the digital copy of the archives of the International Tracing Service (ITS) at the National Archives. This digital copy (over 80 million digital images, stored on roughly six terabytes) pertains to the civil victims of the Nazi regime and contains documents about labour, concentration and extermination camps, registration files about displaced persons, lists about forced labour and a central name index, the originals of which are preserved in Bad Arolsen, Germany. Since January 2013, the parish registers and civil status registers are also accessible for free via the website of the State Archives. Other types of digital documents available in the digital reading room or on the website of the State Archives are, for instance: the proceedings of the Councils of Ministers (1918‚Äì1979), the statistical yearbook of Belgium (and the Belgian Congo) since 1870, over 20,000 seal molds, etc. The reading rooms in the different repositories are accessible to every holder of a valid reader‚Äôs card.

The village is situated approximately north-east from the centre of the city of York. It was historically part of the East Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. History Leavening is listed in the 1086 Domesday Book as in the Acklam Hundred of the East Riding of Yorkshire. At the time of the survey the settlement contained 10 households, 5 villagers, 5 smallholders, and 3 ploughlands. In 1823 Leavening was in the civil parish of Acklam, the Wapentake of Buckrose and the Liberty of St Peter's, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Population was 294, with occupations including thirteen farmers, four nurserymen, two carpenters, two grocers, three shoemakers, a blacksmith, a corn miller, a tailor, a butcher, a linen manufacturer, a schoolmaster, and the landlord of The Hare & Hounds public house. Wesleyan and Primitive Methodist chapels were established in Leavening in the 1820s and an Anglican chapel of ease was established in 1850 which doubled as a school (the parish church being in nearby Acklam). In Kelly's Directory (1893) it is stated that the school had an average attendance of 55 (with provision for 80) and that the population of Leavening in 1891 was 339.

The church was built in 1850 originally as a church school and was licensed for use as a chapel of ease to the church in Acklam. It became a church in its own right in 1965 and was re-dedicated to the Venerable Bede. It is used by the Anglican and Methodist congregations of the village.

The Sixth Form College campus is situated next to Hopwood Hall College in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England, forming an educational quarter in the town. Rochdale is the first sixth form college to be opened in the UK since 2004, and the 93rd sixth form college in the country. The college is a member of the Sixth Form College Association (SFCA), founder of the Student Union of Celebration and Co-operation (SUCC), and the Association of Colleges (AoC). History From the 1970s to the 1990s, most secondary schools in the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale offered sixth form education such as A-levels to school leavers. In addition, Hopwood Hall College also offered a provision of sixth form courses to students. By the 2000s, sixth form students studying in Rochdale Borough were achieving below the national average in terms of A Level results. As well as this, many local school leavers were opting to study sixth form education at schools or colleges outside of Rochdale borough, particularly at dedicated sixth form colleges in nearby areas such as Bury and Oldham. In a local area review of post-16 education in Rochdale in 2004, the Learning and Skills Council proposed the construction of a new sixth form college in Rochdale borough. Rochdale's MP, Paul Rowen, along with local student, Sajid Suleman, launched a campaign in 2006 for a new sixth form college in Rochdale to stop the \\"brain drain\\". After funding for the new college became available, the Department for Children, Schools and Families formally approved the construction of the new college in August 2008. The Founding Principal Julian Appleyard OBE was appointed in December 2008. The Chair of the Governing Body is Dame Pamela Coward, former headteacher of Middleton Technology School. The ¬£26 million new sixth form college campus was subsequently constructed next to Hopwood Hall College in Rochdale town. Rochdale Sixth Form College opened in September 2010, and is now the primary provider of sixth form education in the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale. Since the opening of the college, most (but not all) secondary schools in the borough have ceased to offer sixth form courses for students. Hopwood Hall College has also discontinued its provision of A-levels, concentrating instead on offering vocational further education for school leavers, as well as courses for adult learners. Today Opened in September 2010, Rochdale Sixth Form College offers a range of A-level courses to students from Rochdale and the wider borough. Facilities at the college campus include a theatre, learning resource and study centre, ICT suites, science laboratories, a theatre and drama studio, a specialist dance studio, a music recording studio and editing suite, specialist art and design studios, a restaurant, a coffee house, a fitness suite and a multi-faith prayer room. The first set of academic results by the College were in the top 5% of all sixth form institutions in the UK in value added terms. The College received national coverage for this performance. In the same year the College Principal was the key note speaker at a number of sixth form national conferences and continues to feature leading sessions on post 16 leadership at national conferences. The College continues to make the headlines for its academic performance. The A Level results showed a 99% pass rate and value added for AS Level place it in the top 1% of sixth forms in the country. The College featured very prominently in the Department for Education League Tables in February 2013 where it was number two out of 93 sixth form colleges in the UK in terms of value added. The College had its first OFSTED inspection in March 2013 and received the result of being an outstanding college, one of only two sixth form colleges nationally to be awarded the outstanding status under the rigorous new inspection framework. The College goes from strength to strength and now has national acclaim. The College made history in January 2016 being the first placed college for the third consecutive year in the Department for Education Performance tables for A level progress. The College is a designated National Support School and the former Principal Julian Appleyard a National Leader in Education (NLE). The former College Principal Julian Appleyard was awarded an OBE for Services to Education in the 2016 Queens Birthday Honours List.

Eastern Frontier, Cape of Good Hope, ca 1835 The Dutch East India Company (VOC) that was responsible for trading and colonising of South African land in what is described as ‚Äúfounding‚Äù several urban areas like towns and cities in already populated areas of the west of South Africa. The organisation continually changed the boundaries in the Cape Colony due to European invasion and migration, establishing the Great Fish River as the eastern frontier in 1778. In colonial times, the Ngqika lands were known as British Kaffraria. Later the Apartheid government gave them a form of independence as the former \\"Ciskei\\" homeland. The clan were referred to as ‚ÄúGaika‚Äù people by the Europeans. Origins = Birth of a nation = Ngqika ka Mlawu was the first chief of the Ngqika and the third paramount chief of the Rharhabe people. He had nine wives. The clan was named after him when his grandfather (Rharhabe, the founder of the tribe) and father (Mlawu, who was to be the next chief) both died in 1782. Ngqika, at only four years old, was too young to rule. Ndlambe (who would eventually establish the AmaNdlambe people) was Rharhabe's other son and Ngqika's uncle who became regent until the boy matured ‚Äì in the tradition of the Xhosas. Ndlambe was responsible for the expansion of his tribe's territory and influence. He absorbed smaller clans (like the imiDange people) into the Ngqikas or expelled them to far lands. They were eventually invaded by European settlers from the Cape Colony who fought with them over their prime grazing land, west of the Great Kei River. The occupation by white settlers (Dutch and British) resulted in the century of Xhosa Wars (commonly known as the Frontier Wars) from 1779 to 1879 involving Xhosa tribes (including the Ngqika), Khoikhoi and San people. Relations between the European invaders were fluid throughout this period with the varying indigenous people and Europeans working for or against one another to secure land, resources and cattle. These groups changed allies depending on who would help advance their objectives over the years. In 1793, in collaboration with other Xhosa clans, the Ngqikas fought against white settlers during the Second Frontier War. In 1796, Ngqika turned 18 and was ready to assume his rightful place on the throne, but his uncle was reluctant to give up power. Ndlambe appealed to the tribe to retain his power but this failed. His nephew imprisoned him a year later in an attempt to stifle his power. When he escaped across the Great Fish River in 1799 with his supporters, he attempted to collude with the Cape Colony's white government to overthrow Ngqika, but the colony continued to recognise his nephew as the paramount chief. Ngqika ka Mlawu died in November 1829 after a chest illness and alcohol abuse. Mgolombane Sandile - Xhosa Chief = List of chiefs during Xhosa Wars = Mgolombane Sandile the rightful heir of Ngqika, was only nine years old when his father died. Mnqoma, born to Ngqika and Nomvakalisa Nothontho of the Ngqosini, was the chief's eldest son but because Sandile's mother was a descendant of abaThembu (a royal lineage). Her first son was thus considered the ‚ÄúGreat Son‚Äù. Mnqoma became regent until Sandile was ready to rule. The following is a list of chiefs of the Ngqika that ruled during the Xhosa Wars starting with Sandile's great grandfather, Rharhabe: *Rharhabe: lived 1778 (as the leader of the Rharhabe people) ‚Äì 1782, ruled 1796 - 1782 *Ngqika kaMlawu: lived 1778 ‚Äì 1829, ruled 1796 - 1829 *Mgolombane Sandile: lived 1820 ‚Äì 1878, ruled 1841 - 1878 The native groups lost most of their land and were absorbed into the British empire during this century.

It is an adaptation of Jack Kerouac's 1957 novel On the Road and stars an ensemble cast featuring Garrett Hedlund, Sam Riley, Kristen Stewart, Alice Braga, Amy Adams, Tom Sturridge, Danny Morgan, Elisabeth Moss, Kirsten Dunst, and Viggo Mortensen. The executive producers were Francis Ford Coppola, Patrick Batteux, Jerry Leider, and Tessa Ross. Filming began on August 4, 2010, in Montreal, Quebec, with a $25 million budget. The story is based on the years Kerouac spent travelling the United States in the late 1940s with his friend Neal Cassady and several other Beat Generation figures who would go on to fame in their own right, including William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg. On May 23, 2012, the film premiered in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. The film received mixed early reviews after it premiered at the film festival. The film also premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival in September. Plot In 1947 New York, on the day his father is buried, Sal Paradise is out with his friend Carlo Marx who is, like him, an aspiring writer. They're invited by mutual friend Chad to meet Dean Moriarty, a young car thief from Denver, and Dean's 16-year-old wife Marylou. Sal and Carlo befriend Dean, smoking marijuana with him and visiting a jazz nightclub where they meet saxophonist Walter, who also befriends them. Sal teaches Dean how to write before Dean leaves for Denver with Carlo. After much contemplation, writer's block, and a solemn visit to his father's grave, Sal decides to join his friends in Denver and embarks on the road for the first time. There, Sal meets Camille, an art college student for whom Dean is divorcing Marylou. Carlo starts to question his sexuality, and Carlo and Dean start an affair. Carlo, Sal, Camille, and Dean visit a bar where Dean plays \\"I've Got the World on a String\\" on the jukebox, and Camille bonds with Sal. Carlo tells Sal he thinks he might be gay, and he plans to travel to Africa. Sal leaves aboard a bus and meets Terry. The two travel to California, where Terry works on cotton fields with her family while Sal helps. Sal and Terry have a brief affair before Sal, realizing he isn't made to work in the fields, heads back home. In December 1948, Dean, Marylou, and Ed Dunkel arrive at Sal's sister's home in North Carolina, having left Ed's wife Galatea with Old Bull Lee in Louisiana. Sal's family feeds the trio, who haven't eaten for 30 hours, and the next day the trio, Sal, and Sal's mother drive back to New York. The guys and Marylou celebrate New Year's Eve at Carlo's place. Later, Dean convinces Sal to partake in a threesome with him and Marylou. Sal starts kissing Marylou, but Dean's presence makes him nervous, so he tells Dean to go to the kitchen. Following this, Dean and Marylou have sex, while Sal listens in the other room. The next day, they ride off to California and leave Ed at Bull's. When they arrive in San Francisco, Dean drives to Camille's place, leaving Sal and Marylou to rent a room, where the two have sex. The next morning, Marylou leaves to return to her sailor fianc√© in Denver, and Sal goes over to visit Dean and Camille, who by now have a child together and are expecting a second. Sal and Dean visit a nightclub, leaving Camille alone to deal with the baby. When they return home, she kicks Dean out. Sal and Dean travel to Denver in search of Dean's father, but have no luck finding him. They then travel back to New York with a tall, thin salesman from whom Dean tries to get money in exchange for sex. Dean succeeds, which gives him and Sal enough money to get where they need to go. Eight months later, Dean asks Sal if he would like to drive to Mexico. When they arrive a kid gets high with them and leads them to a whorehouse, where Dean and Sal dance and have sex with some of the prostitutes. They later roam the streets getting stoned and drunk. However, Sal becomes ill and is hospitalized. Dean then leaves Sal behind, returning to San Francisco to fix his relationship with Camille. After recovering, Sal returns to New York. In 1950, Sal meets Dean in Manhattan, on his way to a Duke Ellington concert. Dean says he travelled across the country by train to see Sal and that he is having another child with Camille. Sal's friends hurry him so they can get on their way, and as Sal turns to leave, Dean asks for a lift to East 14th Street. Sal tells Dean it was good to see him, and leaves him to walk as Sal and his friends depart. When Sal returns home that night, he is able to write his novel about his life on the road with Dean.

In 1957, Jack Kerouac wrote a one-page letter to actor Marlon Brando, suggesting that he play Dean Moriarty while Kerouac would portray Sal Paradise. In the letter, Kerouac envisioned the film to be shot \\"with the camera on the front seat of the car showing the road (day and night) unwinding into the windshield, as Sal and Dean yak.\\" Brando never responded to the letter, and later on Warner Bros. offered $110,000 for the rights to Kerouac's book but his agent, Sterling Lord, declined it. Lord hoped for $150,000 from Paramount Pictures, which wanted to cast Brando in the film. The deal did not occur and Kerouac was angered that his agent asked for too much money. Filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola bought the rights in 1979. Over the years, he hired several screenwriters to adapt the book into a film, including Michael Herr and Barry Gifford, only for Coppola to write his own draft with his son Roman. In 1995, the filmmaker planned to shoot on black-and-white 16mm film and held auditions with poet Allen Ginsberg in attendance but the project fell through. Coppola said, \\"I tried to write a script, but I never knew how to do it. It's hard ‚Äì it's a period piece. It's very important that it be period. Anything involving period costs a lot of money.\\" Several years later he tried again with Ethan Hawke and Brad Pitt to play Sal Paradise and Dean Moriarty respectively, but this project also failed to work. In 2001, Coppola hired novelist Russell Banks to write the script and planned to make the film with Joel Schumacher directing and starring Billy Crudup as Sal Paradise and Colin Farrell as Dean Moriarty, but this incarnation of the project was shelved as well. Gus Van Sant also expressed interest in making the film. =Pre-production= Coppola saw The Motorcycle Diaries and hired Brazilian director Walter Salles to direct the film. Salles was drawn to the novel because, according to him, it is about people \\"trying to break into a society that‚Äôs impermeable\\" and that he wants \\"to deal with a generation that collides with its society.\\" At the end of 2008, he was about to have the film greenlit when the American economy collapsed and French financier Pathe wanted to make significant cuts to the $35 million budget. Producer Rebecca Yeldham realized that they could not make the film Salles had originally envisioned. However, while Salles was talking to MK2 Productions in Paris about other potential films, they asked Salles if he had any passion projects. He told them about On the Road and at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, MK2 greenlit production with a $25 million budget in association with Film4 in the U.K., and Videofilmes in Brazil. In preparation for the film, he made the documentary Searching for On the Road, in which he took the same road trip as the lead character in the novel, Sal Paradise, and talked to Beat poets who knew Kerouac. He did this in order to understand \\"the complexity of the jazz-infused prose and the sociopolitical climate that informed the period.\\" Salles was occasionally joined by the film's screenwriter Jose Rivera in addition to spending six months reading up on Kerouac. Rivera then began writing the screenplay, producing approximately 20 drafts. Later drafts relied less on the published book and more on the original manuscript, which had been typed on a 120-foot roll of paper and kept in all the real names. =Casting= In 2010, Salles had to convince the cast he had assembled in 2007 to remain committed to the project. This included Sam Riley as the alter ego of author Jack Kerouac, Sal Paradise, Garrett Hedlund as Dean Moriarty (Neal Cassady), who had been linked to the role since September 2007, and Kristen Stewart as Marylou. Salles had wanted to cast her after seeing the Sean Penn film Into the Wild but had to film her scenes before October 2010 when she started shooting The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn. Kirsten Dunst was later cast as Camille (Carolyn Cassady). By the first week of August 2010, Viggo Mortensen and Amy Adams had joined the cast, Mortensen for the role of Old Bull Lee (William S. Burroughs) and Adams as the character's wife, Jane (Joan Vollmer). English actor Tom Sturridge was cast as Carlo Marx (Allen Ginsberg), poet and friend to both Sal Paradise and Dean Moriarty. Salles reunited with some of the crew members whom he worked with on The Motorcycle Diaries, including producer Rebecca Yeldham, screenwriter Jos√© Rivera, director of photography Eric Gautier, production designer Carlos Conti, and composer Gustavo Santaolalla. Before filming began on August 2, 2010, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the entire cast underwent a three-week \\"beatnik boot camp,\\" according to Stewart, which involved reading literature pertaining to the Beat Generation and was led by Kerouac biographer Gerald Nicosia. He played an audio interview that was recorded in 1978 with LuAnne Henderson, Neal Cassady's wife, on whom the book's character Marylou is based. To give the cast an idea of the kind of film he envisioned, Salles screened Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless and John Cassavetes' Shadows. =Principal photography= Filming began on August 4, 2010, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. After a month of filming in Montreal, the production shot footage in Gatineau, Quebec, on August 17, which stands in for Denver, Colorado, in 1947. The film shot for five days in the middle of October 2010 in and around Calgary, Alberta. The production also shot in New Orleans for a month, then returned to Montreal to shoot the film's final scenes. The production shot for a week in early December 2010 in San Francisco. Salles originally wanted to shoot in Mexico for several weeks but with the escalating drug wars there, very little was filmed and the production moved to Arizona instead. In addition, the production also shot in Argentina and Chile with actor Garrett Hedlund at one point filming a scene in which he drove a 1949 Hudson Hornet in the Andes during a blizzard, wearing goggles and screaming out his window while director Walter Salles sat in the passenger seat holding a camera, with another camera mounted on the front of the car. Hedlund described filming as \\"quite a guerilla shoot. At times, there‚Äôs just been two handfuls of crew members around us and it‚Äôs a very quiet situation.\\" Cinematographer Eric Gautier shot several scenes with a handheld camera, and Salles encouraged the cast to improvise and \\"to make scenes flow and have a rhythm,\\" said Hedlund. =Production Company= MK2, American Zoetrope, Film4, France T√©l√©visions, Canal+, Cin√©+, France 2 Cin√©ma, Vanguard Films, Videofilmes, Jerry Leider Company, IFC Films, Sundance Selects Soundtrack * Hard to Love What You Kill - Written and Performed by Jake La Botz * Don't Explain - Performed by Tom Sturridge * Salt Peanuts - Performed by Dizzy Gillespie * I've Got The World On A String - Performed by Ella Fitzgerald * Yip Roc Heresy - Written and Performed by Slim Gaillard * A Sailboat In The Moonlight - Performed by Billie Holiday & Her Orchestra and Lester Young * Ko- Ko - Written and Performed by Charlie Parker * Death Letter Blues - Written and Performed by Son House * Mean And Evil Blues - Performed by Dinah Washington * Sweet Sixteen - Performed by Greg Kramer Release On the Road screened on May 23, 2012 at the Cannes Film Festival, where it was nominated for the top prize. A shorter version, running 124 minutes, was shown on September 6, 2012 at the Toronto International Film Festival. Theatrical distribution rights in North America were sold to AMC Networks with IFC Films and Sundance Selects releasing it theatrically. StudioCanal bought rights for the United Kingdom and Australia. The film was released in the United States on December 21, 2012. Alongside its theatrical opening, the film was simultaneously released on IFC Films video on demand service. =Box office= The film had a limited release and grossed $744,296 at United States box office and $8,040,022 internationally with a worldwide total of $8,784,318. =Critical reception= Garrett Hedlund's portrayal of Dean Moriarty was singled out for praise. Early reviews of On the Road were mainly mixed, although the performance of Garrett Hedlund was often singled out for praise and Eric Gautier's photography also received favorable notice. The film has a 44% approval rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 153 reviews and an average score of 5.53/10. The website's critical consensus states: \\"Beautiful to look at but a bit too respectfully crafted, On the Road doesn't capture the energy and inspiration of Jack Kerouac's novel.\\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 32 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". In The Hollywood Reporter, veteran reviewer Todd McCarthy praised the film, writing \\"While the film‚Äôs dramatic impact is variable, visually and aurally it is a constant pleasure. Eric Gautier‚Äôs cinematography is endlessly resourceful, making great use of superb and diverse locations\\". McCarthy also spoke highly of Hedlund's performance saying, \\"Although the story is Sal/Kerouac‚Äôs, the star part is Dean, and Hedlund has the allure for it; among the men here, he‚Äôs the one you always watch, and the actor effectively catches the character‚Äôs impulsive, thrill- seeking, risk-taking, responsibility-avoiding personality.\\" Entertainment Weekly magazine's Owen Gleiberman wrote, \\"The best thing in the movie is Garrett Hedlund‚Äôs performance as Dean Moriarty, whose hunger for life ‚Äì avid, erotic, insatiable, destructive ‚Äì kindles a fire that will light the way to a new era. Hedlund is as hunky as the young Brad Pitt, and like Pitt, he‚Äôs a wily, change-up actor\\". Stewart's performance garnered some mixed reviews, with one critic writing \\"Stewart as Marylou completes the awkward threesome for a large part of the film and whilst there is little for her to do here she also makes very little out of what she has to work with,\\" and that she \\"flatters to deceive, offering some moments of passion...criminally underplaying a character in Marylou who is supposed to burn with energy.\\" However, New York magazine's Kyle Buchanan wrote, \\"Certainly, there's nothing regrettable about Stewart's performance here: It reestablishes the promising character actress last seen in Into the Wild and held captive as Twilight's leading lady for years,\\" and Todd McCarthy said, Stewart \\"is perfect in the role.\\" Peter Travers from Rolling Stone gave her a positive notice, calling her \\"a live wire. In the front seat of a car with Sal and Dean ‚Äì all naked ‚Äì she jerks off both boys with a joy that defines free spirit.\\" In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis criticized the film saying, \\"Mr. Salles, an intelligent director whose films include The Motorcycle Diaries, doesn't invest On the Road with the wildness it needs for its visual style, narrative approach and leads. This lack of wildness ‚Äì the absence of danger, uncertainty or a deep feeling for the mad ones ‚Äì especially hurts Dean, who despite the appealing Mr. Hedlund, never jumps off the screen to show you how Cassady fired up Kerouac and the rest\\". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian felt that the film was a \\"good-looking but directionless and self-adoring road movie\\", and that it had \\"a touching kind of sadness in showing how poor Dean is becoming just raw material for fiction, destined to be left behind as Sal becomes a New York big-shot. But this real sadness can't pierce or dissipate this movie's tiresome glow of self-congratulation\\". Finally,Time magazine's Richard Corliss had a problem with Salles' approach to the material: \\"Though there‚Äôs plenty of cool jazz in the background, the movie lacks the novel‚Äôs exuberant syncopation ‚Äì it misses the beat as well as the Beat. Some day someone may make a movie worthy of On the Road, but Salles wasn't the one to try. This trip goes nowhere\\". Eric Ehrmann, writing in the May 31, 2012 edition of the Huffington Post, blamed Francis Ford Coppola for having \\"outsourced\\" the film to \\"a Brazilian director from a billionaire banking family who gentrified\\" the novel's characters. Ehrmann, a pioneering New Journalism writer, covered the funeral of Jack Kerouac for Rolling Stone in 1969. =Home media= On the Road was released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 17, 2012 by Icon Entertainment International.

It is a large Federal style house, built of random-cut ashlar granite, with a hip roof. A single-story porch extends across the building's front and wraps around the left side. There is a single-story wood frame addition east of the front facade, set before a recessed original kitchen section. The interior is finished with high quality woodwork, which is mostly Federal in style. Passages between the public rooms downstairs are typically finished as keystoned arches. The house was built between 1814 and 1818 by Joseph Perkins, a descendant of one of the area's early settlers. His daughter, Mary Perkins Rockwell, and her husband John A. Rockwell inherited the property, making a number of alterations to it. The Rockwell family retained ownership, successive generations occupying it until 1934, when they gave it to the local DAR chapter.

People working in Silicon Valley and the Tri-Valley areas began moving into the relatively undeveloped East County area of Contra Costa County. By the early 1990s, traffic congestion on Vasco Road had become severe and accidents were frequent. In 1996, concurrently with the construction of Los Vaqueros Reservoir, a segment of Vasco was relocated and widened to accommodate increased traffic and heavy trucks.Hallisy, Erin. \\"Safer Road to Open in East Bay / Brentwood-Livermore route to change because of reservoir.\\" April 15, 1996. The old roadway was submerged by the reservoir. When the road re-opened, it carried about 16,000 vehicles per day.\\"The Dilemma of Vasco Road,\\" Traffic Safety Center on-line newsletter, volume 2, number 2, Spring- Summer 2004. In 2009, Vasco Road was extended northwestward from Walnut Street to Marsh Creek Road, where it joined the third segment of John Marsh Heritage Highway (California State Route 4 Bypass, now part of California State Route 4).\\"State Route 4 Bypass Authority Project Information Web site In 2010, a section of the road in Alameda County was relocated and widened, eliminating a steep narrow section with several switchbacks. =Safety issues= As originally constructed, Vasco Road was unprepared to meet the demands of high- volume traffic. Blind curves, narrow lanes, steep hills and inadequate shoulders all contributed to the increasing number of accidents. Some of these issues remained even after the relocation and reconstruction of much of the road. Many of these accidents were fatal, head-on collisions. A 2004 engineering study reported that there had been 254 collisions between June 1996 through August 2003.\\"Contra Costa County Vasco Road Safety Recommendations Summary Report\\" Updated April 14, 2004.\\" The engineering firm that performed the safety report considered the feasibility of installing a concrete barrier down the center median. This proposal was rejected because of the high cost, as well as objections by some county agencies about lack of adequate access to emergencies. As an alternative, the engineers recommended that Contra Costa County install \\"rumble strips\\" from Walnut Boulevard to the Alameda county line. These are roughened strips of asphalt placed down the center line and the sides of each lane, intended to alert drivers when they stray off the road or into the oncoming traffic lane. This alternative was implemented by the county, along with adding \\"Do Not Pass\\" and \\"Passing Lane Ahead\\" signs at appropriate places. In August 2006, former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed SB 3 into law, establishing a \\"double fine\\" section on Vasco Road from Walnut Boulevard in Brentwood to Interstate 580 in Livermore. The law doubled the fines for \\"unlawful passing and overtaking, excessive speed, reckless driving, drunken driving and other serious moving violations\\" until Jan. 1, 2010.Lucas, Greg. San Francisco Chronicle. August 29, 2006 However, road signs declaring the double fine zone were still up as of June 2016. Contra Costa County began a project in 2010 to install a median barrier along a one-mile stretch of the road. This also required widening the roadway and a bridge, building retaining walls, and extending a passing lane.Shields, Brian. \\"Contra Costa County Breaks Ground on Vasco Road Repairs.\\" Kron4.com.

TMA-06M was the 115th flight of a Soyuz spacecraft, the first flight launching in 1967. Soyuz TMA-06M launch was also the first crewed flight from the remote Site 31 pad since July 1984. The Soyuz remained on board the space station for the Expedition 33 increment to serve as an emergency escape vehicle. Soyuz TMA-06M successfully returned to Earth on 15 March 2013. Crew The Soyuz TMA-06M crew members conduct their ceremonial tour of Red Square on 25 September 2012. = Backup crew = Rollout The Soyuz-FG rollout by train on 21 October 2012 On 21 October 2012, the Soyuz-FG rocket booster with Soyuz TMA-06M spacecraft was rolled out by train and erected on pad 6 at Site 31, also referred to as the Tereshkova pad. Launch pad 31/6 was used for this mission since the usual launch pad for crewed flights ‚Äì pad 5 at Site 1 was undergoing maintenance and upgrades. Also on the launch day, the crew's trip to the 31/6 Launch Pad took about one hour and 10 minutes ‚Äì 50 minutes longer than the drive to the 1/5 Launch Pad. Launch The TMA-06M spacecraft launches to the International Space Station on 23 October 2012. Soyuz TMA-06M was launched atop of a Soyuz-FG rocket at 10:51:11 GMT on 23 October 2012 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, in Kazakhstan. The launch of TMA-06M from Baikonur's Site 31 was the first human liftoff from that launch pad since July 1984 when Soyuz T-12 was sent to the Salyut 7 space station. Following the flawless launch, the Soyuz spacecraft successfully achieved orbital insertion 9 minutes later and began its 34-orbit journey to the International Space Station. Live television from inside the Soyuz TMA-06M command module showed commander Oleg Novitskiy monitoring the automated ascent from the center seat. Seated on the left and right to him was flight engineer Evgeny Tarelkin and NASA astronaut Kevin Ford, respectively. Shortly after the launch, one of the cosmonauts reported an alarm of some nature, but flight controllers later said there were no obvious problems. =Docking= On board the Space Station, Soyuz crew talk with the Russian Mission Control shortly after docking. In order to set up the Rendezvous Operations, the Soyuz spacecraft performed three orbital adjustments to increase its altitude. The first two of these burns was completed on the launch day with the first conducted just 4.5 hours after the launch. The third burn was conducted on Flight Day 2. Aboard the Space Station, the crew also took final preparations for the docking and cameras aboard the Station were configured to record the next day's docking. On the docking day, the Automated Rendezvous Sequence that was initiated at 10:11 UTC. After three minutes, the Space Station also conducted a maneuver to the proper Docking Attitude and the Soyuz crew activated the KURS Navigation System that provides accurate Range and Velocity Data for the spacecraft's on- board computers. When arriving at a distance of 300 meters, Mission Controllers in Korolev, Russia gave a GO for the Flyaround. After the Flyaround was completed, station-keeping operations began at a distance of 190 meters from the Space Station. This period was used by the Mission Controllers to verify all systems and alignment with the Space Station. Station-keeping was shortened as all system checked out well and the green light was issued for the final approach. Soyuz TMA-06M docked with the ISS at 12:29 GMT on 25 October 2012, about six minutes earlier than planned. The spacecraft docked at the MRM-2 Poisk module, while Soyuz TMA-06M and the ISS were flying as the space station flew above southern Ukraine. The crew performed the standard one-hour leak check operation before getting started with hatch opening procedures. After leak checks and system checks were completed, the crew opened the hatches and entered the Space Station at around 15:15 GMT. They were greeted by Expedition 33 crewmembers Sunita Williams, Yuri Malenchenko and Akihiko Hoshide. Return to Earth Soyuz TMA-06M undocked from the ISS on 15 March 2013 at 11:43 PM (GMT), carrying Novitsky, Tarelkin, and Ford, and landed safely at 3:06:30 AM (GMT) the following day.

Crystal Lake is a popular place for residents to enjoy swimming, boating and fishing. Geography The lake lies near the southeastern corner of Manchester at an elevation somewhat over above sea level. The lake's outlet stream flows west to Cohas Brook, a tributary of the Merrimack River, which flows south and east to the Gulf of Maine and the Atlantic Ocean.  History  Crystal Lake was historically known as Skenker's Pond and later as Mosquito Pond. In 1919, the city of Manchester built a public bathing area at the north end of the pond. The main entrance area consisted of a bathhouse and picnic grounds near the beach. The lake was the site of city-sponsored swim meets for children in the 1920s. Eventually, due to the lake's growing popularity, the facilities at Crystal Lake had to be expanded. In 1942 a new bathhouse was constructed and the beach was extended by the Works Progress Administration. In 1987, the fieldstone-constructed bathhouse underwent a renovation sponsored by the City Parks and Recreation DepartmentManchester Union Leader, 1987 and still stands at the site today. =Hermit of Mosquito Pond= The story of the Hermit of Mosquito Pond is about a man who lived secluded on Crystal Lake for 60 years.

He purchased over of land, on which he built a house out of logs he found on the property. He also grew his own food and herbs. He used the herbs to barter with local apothecaries. Over the years his hermit lifestyle made him into a kind of local celebrity, and he became the object of great curiosity. Despite his secluded lifestyle he would be visited by hundreds of people every summer. Mr. Lambert lived at his hermit homestead for over 60 years, spending the last two years of his life with the Sisters of Mercy at the House of St. John for aged men.

It is a culturally relevant center that leverages sound medical knowledge to improve resilience, preserve psychological health, improve care for sailors, marines and their families and facilitate Navy Medicine research efforts on psychological health and traumatic brain injury. History In 2007, several American government commissions examined the healthcare systems of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for treating warriors who were wounded in the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Sweeping recommendations for change were made, the majority of which pertained to what have become known as the signature wounds of the wars, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As a result, the Department of Defense and the Veterans Health Administration embarked on an overhaul of how their healthcare systems were addressing the needs of wounded warriors with five strategic goals reflecting the breadth of the psychological- health spectrum: # Provide timely access to comprehensive care. # Provide evidence-based and consistently excellent quality of care. # Improve transition and coordination of care across DoD, VA and civilian networks. # Promote the use of consistent and effective screening, tracking and monitoring practices. # Strengthen psychological health, promote resilience and reduce stigma associated with care through prevention, education, training and outreach. The U.S. Navy provides all medical services for the Marine Corps. Funded by the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED), NCCOSC is located at the Naval Medical Center San Diego; Capt. Paul S. Hammer, a board-certified psychiatrist, was named director of the center in February 2008. Capt. Scott Johnston, a clinical psychologist, succeeded Capt. Hammer as director in April, 2011. Mission Naval Center for Combat and Operational Stress Control tries to improve the psychological health of Marines and sailors through comprehensive programs that educate service members, build resilience, aid research and promote best practices in the treatment of combat and operational stress injuries. NCCOSC initiatives are informed by science and provide measurable, wide-reaching results. To achieve its mission, NCCOSC focuses on these specific areas: * Stress injuries, PTSD and TBI. NCCOSC educates leaders, sailors, marines and their families to recognize the signs and symptoms of stress illnesses and TBI. It also develops and disseminates programs and tools that build psychological resilience to withstand and cope with combat and operational stress. * Stress Recognition and Management. NCCOSC designs programs and products to promote resilience, emphasizing the need for it to begin in boot camp and continue through a service member's career. Family resilience also is emphasized to help successfully manage the pressures of all phases of deployment and a high-tempo operational environment. * Anti-Stigma. NCCOSC addresses negative perceptions that might be attached to any psychological health concern to overcome any barrier to seeking treatment. * Suicide Prevention. NCCOSC develops instructional materials for all levels of command leaders to actively engage service members in recognizing the warning signs for suicide and the appropriate steps to take for prevention. * Common Standards and Processes. NCCOSC promotes the best practices among clinicians and caregivers for achieving and maintaining psychological health. Major NCCOSC Projects in 2011 include: * Hosted annual Navy and Marine Corps Combat and Operational Stress Control Conference (April) * Continued development and presentation of suicide-prevention training modules for various Navy communities; * Development of psychological health pathways for Navy medical treatment facilities; * Training military healthcare providers in evidenced- based therapies to treat combat and operational stress injuries and illnesses; * Preparation of white papers to address evidenced-based research in such areas as resilience, PTSD and physical health, and substance abuse and operational stress; * Expansion of outreach efforts to erase any stigma associated with seeking help for psychological health issues.

It is a large two-story Bungalow style house, designed by Dudley St. Clair Donnelly and built in 1908 by financier Morton Freeman Plant, and is one of the only early 20th-century purpose-built hunting lodges in the state. It was the heart of a large private game preserve that Plant stocked with game birds. The property, now reduced to , is surrounded by town conservation land and a state military reservation. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 1988. Description and history The Morton Freeman Plant Hunting Lodge is located in an isolated rural setting in western East Lyme. The lodge stands on 105 acres of land, nearly completely surrounded by town conservation land and a state National Guard training center, all land that was once historically associated with the lodge. There are two buildings on the lodge grounds, which are entirely wooded except for the clearing in which they stand, and Stone Ranch Road, which provides access. The lodge is a 1-1/2 story frame structure with a broad hip roof that creates an overhanging porch in the front, supported by stone piers. Dormers pierce three of the roof faces, and a single-story service ell extends to the rear of the main block. The interior of the building retains original finishes, including two concrete fireplaces built to resemble those found in 16th-century European manor houses. Morton Freeman Plant's father, Henry Plant, made the family fortune by developing railroads in Florida. He took over his father's business in 1899. Born and raised in southeastern Connecticut, Plant began purchasing land in East Lyme and Lyme as a hunting retreat in 1907, which grew to about 2400 acres by 1914. The lodge was built in 1908 to a design by Dudley St. Clair Donnelly, a regionally prominent architect who executed a number of commissions for Plant. Plant died in the 1918 influenza pandemic, and the property was broken up by his heirs.

Career Talent-spotted in her teens, Hylton was a product of the Rank Organisation's Company of Youth (more commonly referred to as the Rank Charm School), which took promising young actors and groomed them for a career in film. The programme turned out some genuine stars such as Dirk Bogarde and Diana Dors, but most alumni went on to more modest film careers, regularly employed in British films but rarely if ever receiving star-billing. Female graduates of the programme were often referred to somewhat disparagingly as \\"Rank Starlets\\", with the implication that their purpose was merely to appear on screen and look glamorous; however Hylton did go on to feature in a number of substantial acting roles with prominent billing. Hylton's first screen appearance came in a 1946 programmer A Girl in a Million. She quickly moved on to minor roles in films produced by Gainsborough Studios (Jassy, When the Bough Breaks) and Ealing Studios (Holiday Camp, It Always Rains on Sunday), then in 1948 landed her largest role to date, as an escaped convict's mistress in Gainsborough's My Brother's Keeper. She was cast as one of the daughters in the successful comedy Here Come the Huggetts, then in 1949 as Molly Reed in the Ealing Comedy Passport to Pimlico. In the early 1950s Hylton was cast in major roles in several films with a predominantly female cast and targeted at female audiences; Dance Hall (1950), It Started in Paradise (1952 ‚Äì set in the world of haute couture) and 1954 women's prison drama The Weak and the Wicked. The quality of film roles offered to her then began to fall and she found herself for the rest of the decade toiling mainly in quickly-shot B-films, an exception being a prominent role in the 1960 horror film Circus of Horrors. Hylton's first television appearance was in the starring role of Queen Guinevere in the 1956 series The Adventures of Sir Lancelot and from the early 1960s she spent her career entirely in television, where she featured in a number of one-off productions for BBC and ITV drama strands as well as appearing in series such as Dixon of Dock Green, Journey to the Unknown, The Troubleshooters and Take Three Girls. Her most identifiable TV role was Beryl Fisher, the mother of the hapless Betty Spencer (Michele Dotrice) in the BBC comedy series Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em. Critical assessment The film historians Steve Chibnall and Brian McFarlane praise her \\"quite unusual intensity and a real capacity for depicting working-class lives\\", and note of her extensive B movie career in the 1950s: \\"Virtually everything she did is worth watching, for her if sometimes for little else.\\" They add that each film she was in \\"benefits from the instinctive humanity, the sense of her characters' having a past and a place in the world, which she brings to them\\".Steve Chibnall & Brian McFarlane, The British 'B' Film, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2009, p. 187. Personal life Hylton's first marriage to film producer Euan Lloyd ended in divorce, although the couple remained on good terms. The marriage produced a daughter, Rosalind Lloyd, who also became an actress; Hylton and her daughter both appeared in Lloyd's big budget 1978 mercenary drama The Wild Geese, which was Hylton's first screen role for 17 years and turned out to be the last of her career. Hylton's second marriage to actor Peter Dyneley, whom she met on the set of The Manster, lasted until Dyneley's death from cancer in 1977. Hylton, who had been diagnosed with a congenital heart defect in her late 30s, died of a heart attack in Glasgow on 28 February 1979, aged 52.

The main house consists of an 1844 Greek Revival brick structure, to which a number of Colonial Revival additions and alterations were made between about 1930 and 1945. The property also includes a formal garden designed by landscape architect Marian Cruger Coffin. The property is notable as a well-documented and preserved smaller-scale example of her work. and The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 17, 2001. Description and history Springbank is located in a rural residential area on the east side of Neck Road (Connecticut Route 156), a short way north of its junction with Talcott Farm Road. A short entrance drive provides access to a parking area and garage, which are set near the road, with the house behind the parking area. The formal gardens are arranged in terraces to the north of the house and east of the garage. The house is a 2-1/2 story brick building, the product of an evolutionary construction history with multiple gables and roof lines. Its principal facade faces south, with a projecting entrance vestibule flanked by sash windows, with a larger picture window extending the facade to the right. It is set on a stone foundation that is exposed in front of the parking area due to the sloping terrain, with secondary entrances into that level. The house was built in 1844 by Thomas Pilgrim, owner of a landing on the nearby Connecticut River, who promptly sold it. It was owned by a succession of lower-middle class owners through 1928. It was bought by Katherine Talcott, a member of the Old Saybrook Garden Club, who probably added the garage and may have begun landscaping the property. The next owners, Arthur and Gertrude Wild, bought the property in 1935, and retained Robert Carter, a local architect, to design a major Colonial Revival restyling of the house. They also retained Marian Cruger Coffin to develop the gardens around Carter's design. Coffin's design is essentially a small-scale version of work she typically did for much larger country estates.

The house was built about 1835, on land purchased by Doctor Ashbel Woodward, a prominent local physician, in 1834. Woodward, a graduate of Bowdoin College, settled in Franklin in 1829, and served as the town's primary medical practitioner until his death in 1885. He was also interested in local history, amassing a collection of historic and prehistoric artifacts, and writing a book-length history of Franklin which was published in 1869. The property was given to the town by his descendants in 1947.

Since its construction in 1890, the mansion has served as a private residence, a restaurant, a boarding house, the home of the Founding Church of Scientology, and‚Äîcurrently‚Äîthe location of Scientology's National Affairs office. The mansion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.  Design, construction, and early use  The mansion was designed by the architectural firm of Hornblower and Marshall in an early eclectic beaux arts style to serve as the home of New York merchant George S. Fraser. The building is three stories tall with two basement levels and an attic. It is constructed of red brick and pink granite with a colonnaded entrance porch with balustraded deck, and a tiled, hipped roof. The interior was planned around a central open stair, with large, central halls on each floor. It was constructed in 1890 at a cost of $75,000, more than ten times the cost of a typical Washington home at that time. Fraser Mansion prior to 1901 alterations The building served as Fraser's residence until his death in 1896. In 1901, Fraser's widow sold the mansion to Pennsylvania Congressman Joseph Earlston Thropp, where he took up residence beginning on March 3, 1901. The Thropps made exterior alterations, enlarging dormer windows and adding an oriel window in 1901. In 1905, architects Totten and Rogers designed a terrace with an entrance to the house near the oriel window, and also redesigned the garden wall. The mansion remained in the ownership of Thropp and his wife, Miriam Scott-Thropp, until Scott-Thropp's death in 1930.  Restaurant  In 1932, the lower floor of the mansion began operation as the Parrot Tea Room, a tea house, with a boarding house located on the upper levels. In 1950, upon leasing to John Goldstein, the facility was converted to a restaurant and renamed the Golden Parrot. The mansion was sold in 1974, and the restaurant was renamed the Golden Booeymonger. Later, the mansion became home to nightclubs Larry Brown's and Sagittarius. The mansion was again sold in 1981 to Walter Sommer for $2 million. In 1982, following a $3 million restoration/renovation, the Fourways fine dining restaurant on the first floor and the Bermuda Bar and Grill below it were opened. The Fourways served Continental European and American dishes under the leadership of chef Jacques Barre. Fraser Mansion as the Golden Parrot restaurant By 1988, Sommer opened the Bermuda Bar and Grill patio-cafe alongside the Fourways. According to the Nation's Restaurant News, the restaurant seated 40 people inside and 60 outside, and was modeled after the Fourways Restaurant and Inn of Bermuda. Among other things, the restaurant featured an all-you-can-eat salad bar, an unlimited Sunday brunch, and \\"traditional Bermuda drink, Dark & Stormy, made with Bermuda's Goslings Black Seal rum and Ginger Beer. Another Bermudian tradition, Bermuda Fish Chowder with Outerbridge's Sherry Peppers Sauce was always on the menu.  Proposed apartment building  In 1987, Sommer proposed to construct a seven-story, 29-unit apartment building in its parking lot behind the mansion. At the time, the property was zoned residential, with variances permitting a restaurant on the property. Then-owner Walter Sommer claimed that the variances restricted him unfairly, requiring him to go to the zoning board multiple times for changes to his business, in a process that he considered costly and time consuming. Additionally, Sommer claimed that without commercial zoning, he was unable to obtain a \\"realistic commercial loan\\" to fund maintenance costs. Between 1982 and 1987, the D.C. Board of Zoning Appeals granted Sommer variances to expand the commercial use of the building above the first floor permitting a private business club on the second floor. The club never opened. The third floor was an apartment for the General Manager. While the proposed design for the building was approved by the D.C. Office of Planning and the Historic Preservation Review Board, and the Department of Public Works had determined that the plans, which would have included underground parking for both the apartments and the restaurant, would not cause an increase in parking or traffic problems in the area, the community opposed the building's construction. Nearby resident Duff Gilfont described the proposed apartment building as \\"such a blight to this area,\\" and that \\"there would have been so many people inconvenienced by it.\\" Several neighborhood associations opposed rezoning the building, expressing concern that the new building would be used as a hotel. Sommer denied that there were plans to use the building as a hotel or an office building. Fraser Mansion in 1975, as the Sagittarius nightclub Several covenants were proposed. One would require that the new building only be used for residential purposes. A second would have required that any future owners of the Fraser Mansion would be required to submit their plans for the building for review by the D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board. A third proposed covenant would have split the zoning of the property, allowing only residential use of the building, but requiring variances for any changes in the parking for the restaurant or the apartment building. Despite the proposed covenants, however, community groups vowed to continue to fight the proposal.  Bankruptcy and attempted sale  During the fight over the building's zoning, Sommer claimed that he would go bankrupt if he was unable to develop the property. Fourways filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1989, and by October 1989, the Fourways restaurant had closed. Trying to pay creditors, Sommer attempted to sell the mansion. Sommer's initial asking price was $7 million, which he later reduced to $3 million. A number of embassies and chanceries looked at the mansion, but none purchased. According to real estate broker Stanley Holland, Sommer \\"thought it was worth more than it was.\\"  Church of Scientology  In 1994, the Church of Scientology purchased the property with the intention of using the building as a church facility. In purchasing the building, Scientology first purchased mortgages on the building in 1993 from the FDIC, which had assumed the loans after the 1990 failure of the National Bank of Washington. Following the purchase of the loans, Scientology foreclosed on the building. In the subsequent foreclosure auction, Scientology purchased the building for $2.7 million. Following $1 million in renovations, the building was dedicated as the new Founding Church of Scientology on October 21, 1995 by Religious Technology Center chairman David Miscavige. The Founding Church of Scientology relocated from the Fraser Mansion to the nearby Embassy Building on 16th Street NW on October 31, 2009. Fraser Mansion now serves as the National Affairs office for the Church of Scientology.

The house is historically significant for its bolection molding and around fireplaces and shallow molded shelves above the fireplaces in the front chambers. Fireplace in the east room has a large single over-mantel panel and the west fireplace has two panels. Mary McMahon, who prepared the inventory form for the National Register of Historic Places, writes \\"A handsome corner cabinet with butterfly shelves is also located in the east room\\". The second floor retains its original flooring and mantels, and the post and beam construction is visible throughout the interior of the house.

The CCC shingled the exterior of the house, but it is uncertain if the \\"inappropriate porch\\" was an addition they made. The CCC is also believed to be the builders of the garage/workshop.  Owners  The owners of the house are also unknown, but two records do exist. The 1854 Baker map of New London, listed owner of the house was Captain J. Avery. An 1868 map lists a H.

Importance  The Avery House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. According to the nomination form and the multiple property submission sheet, the house is historically significant as an example of a well-preserved house that does not have its historical integrity degraded by alterations. McMahon writes that \\"[t]he interior paneling is the finest in any 18th-century house owned by DEP (Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection).\\" Originally, the house was set to have the surrounding as part of its designation, but this was later changed to because it would not impact the historic setting.

They come in several forms, including funnel traps, sticky traps (using materials such as fly paper), nets and pots exposed in the field.In Pursuit of a Better Seed Trap Adam Wiese, John Zasada and Terry Strong United States Department of Agriculture. Types of trap There are many options when using seed traps based on the specific need for the project. Seed traps can be made in different sizes, shapes, and of different material. Traditionally, seed traps are wooden frames with a screened bottom. Traps with metal frames have also been used. Additionally, funnel-shaped traps that are set above the soil or leveled at the ground, traps with screen or cloth bags, traps with water or soil to germinate them, plastic buckets, or traps with sticky surfaces have been used. =Sticky traps= The substance on sticky traps must be nontoxic to the seeds and non-drying. Many sticky traps are petroleum-based. They are also cheaper (approximately $1.20‚Äì1.30 per use), lighter and less bulky than other traps. However, rain or dew may affect the adhesive. Heat and light intensities can also cause sticky traps to loose their adhesiveness. =Pollen traps= Pollen traps are used to measure production and dispersal of pollen in plants. These traps are commonly made of glass slides with silicone oils or sticky tapes. They can be set up horizontally or as cylinder containers. =Fruit traps= These traps can collect fruit production from various plants. These are also constructed on the ground, hanging or as basins or funnels. Choosing a trap When choosing a trap, certain factors must be considered. The seed dispersal unit (where the seeds will fall), timing of dispersal, and density of seed fall (how much will be produced). Smaller traps may be appropriate for trees that produce more seeds, and larger traps may be appropriate for trees that produce less seeds to guarantee collection. It is difficult to compare different traps. There are also some drawbacks to consider when choosing a trap. Wood traps may easily deteriorate if not constructed properly. Traps may also be hard to store or set up depending on size. Cloth and screens are easily torn in bad weather conditions and are also targets for animals. Screens may also harm many insects. Traps with water or soil must be maintained consistently. Extra seeds may clog the traps or seeds may be blown or washed out causing an over or underestimate of seed dispersal. Sticky traps are also clogged by other debris. Maintenance Traps must be checked weekly depending on the rate of seed dispersal. Seed identification must be accurate. This can be challenging because there is no comprehensive identification key, so focusing on only a few species at a time is important. You can also attempt to germinate the seeds. Screens may help prevent predation by animals and insects. References * G√∂sta Kjellsson; Vibeke Simonsen (1997).

It is not useful for prevention. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include sleepiness, dizziness, tiredness, and numbness. Lasmiditan was approved in the United States in October 2019 and became available in February 2020. It was developed by Eli Lilly. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Lasmiditan is a serotonin receptor agonist that, like the unsuccessful LY-334,370, selectively binds to the 5-HT1F receptor subtype. A number of triptans have been shown to act on this subtype as well, but only after their affinity for 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D has been made responsible for their anti- migraine activity. The lack of affinity for these receptors might result in fewer side effects related to vasoconstriction compared to triptans in susceptible people, such as those with ischemic heart disease, Raynaud's phenomenon or after a myocardial infarction, although a 1998 review has found such side-effects to rarely occur in people taking triptans. Adverse effects There is a risk of driving impairment while taking lasmiditan. People are advised not to drive or operate machinery for at least eight hours after taking lasmiditan, even if they feel well enough to do so. People who cannot follow this advice are advised not to take lasmiditan. The drug causes central nervous system (CNS) depression, including dizziness and sedation. It should be used with caution if taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS depressants.  History  Lasmiditan was discovered by Eli Lilly and Company and was then relicensed to CoLucid Pharmaceuticals in 2006, until CoLucid was bought by Eli Lilly in 2017, to allow Eli Lilly to reacquire the drug's intellectual property. The drug is protected by patents until 2031. Phase II clinical trials for dose finding purposes were completed in 2007, for an intravenous form and in early 2010, for an oral form. Eli Lilly submitted a new drug application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2018. Three Phase III clinical trials were completed. The SPARTAN trial compared placebo with 50, 100, and 200 mg of lasmiditan. SAMURAI compared placebo with 100 and 200 mg doses of lasmiditan. GLADIATOR is an open-label study that compared 100 and 200 mg doses of lasmiditan in subjects that received the drug as part of a prior trial. Topline results from the SPARTAN trial showed that the drug induced met its primary and secondary endpoints in the trial. The primary result showed a statistically significant improvement in pain relief relative to placebo 2 hours after the first dose. The secondary result showed a statistically significantly greater percentage of subjects were free of their most bothersome symptom (MBS) compared with placebo at two hours following the first dose. The FDA approved lasmiditan primarily based on data from two clinical trials, Trial 1 (# NCT02439320) and Trial 2 (#NCT02605174) of 4439 subjects with migraine headaches with or without aura. Trials were conducted at 224 sites in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The FDA approved the drug in October 2019. However, , the drug was awaiting Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) scheduling before it was made available in the United States. It was placed into Schedule V in January 2020.  Dosage  Lasmiditan is delivered in 50 & 100 mg tablet form.

Epstein Hebrew Academy is a Jewish day school in University City, Missouri. It was established in 1943 and was the first Jewish day school in St. Louis. The school is named for the first chief rabbi of the Orthodox Jewish community of St. Louis, Rabbi Hayim Fischel Epstein (1874‚Äì1942). It has been given the nickname EHA, an abbreviation of its full name. From 1960 until the end of 2019, the school was housed on the six-acre Israel and Yetra Goldberg Educational Campus in Olivette, Missouri. In January 2020, it moved to a new location in University City, closer to where many of the students of the school are from. The school also housed Yeshivat Kadimah High School since 2013, which moved with EHA to University City in 2020. History The H.F. Epstein Hebrew Academy, established in 1943, was the first Jewish day school in St. Louis. The school is named for the first chief rabbi of the Orthodox Jewish community of St. Louis, Rabbi Hayim Fischel Epstein (1874‚Äì1942). Until the establishment of the school, Jewish education in St. Louis had been provided by a system of Talmudei Torah. These schools were administered by the \\"United Hebrew Schools\\" organization, later reorganized as the \\"Associated Hebrew Schools of St. Louis\\", under the leadership of Harry Yawitz. In 1922, there were four Orthodox Talmudei Torah in St. Louis providing for the Jewish educational needs of the community. By 1939, there were fourteen of these schools, located mostly on the premises of various synagogues. In 1943, Yawitz was one of the founders and supporters of the H.F. Epstein Hebrew Academy, which consolidated the Talmudei Torah into the first Orthodox Jewish day school in St. Louis. At first, the school did not have a dedicated school building. Classes were held in various locations including homes, synagogue classrooms and other school buildings. In 1960, the construction of a building in Olivette was completed and became the permanent location of the EHA. In 2019, EHA sold the school building and property in Olivette to the Miriam Academy and purchased a new location in University City. The school moved to the new location in January 2020. The new location was originally a public school building built in 1958. Curriculum and activities The school defines itself as a child-centered Orthodox Jewish day school, dedicated to educating Jewish children in Torah and general studies, developing love for Israel and the Jewish people, teaching critical thinking and reasoning, excelling in all the academic disciplines and instilling good character (middot) and values of caring for others (chesed). The school is accredited by the Independent Schools Association of the Central States (ISACS) and is associated with the Torah U‚ÄôMesorah (National Association of Hebrew Day Schools) network of schools and Yeshiva University‚Äôs Institute for University School Partnership. The school is overseen by an elected Board of Directors. The parent organization, Friends of the Hebrew Academy raises funds and holds educational and other events for the school. The school follows a dual curriculum of Judaic studies, including Hebrew language, and general studies. The general studies curriculum generally complies with the requirements of the Missouri Department of Education. After-school activities that are offered include art, sports and drama.

With its oldest portion estimated to date to 1740, it is one of Griswold's few 18th-century buildings. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 15, 1993. Description and history The Edward Cogswell House is located in a rural area of eastern Griswold, on the west side of Hopeville Road, about north of Connecticut Route 138. It is a -story wood-frame structure, five bays wide, with a large central chimney, clapboard siding, and a stone foundation. A -story ell extends to the rear. The ell is probably the oldest portion of the building, a not uncommon occurrence for houses of the period. The interior follows a typical central chimney plan, with a small entry vestibule that has a narrow winding stair to the second floor. Parlors flank the chimney on either side, and the kitchen extends across the rear, with small chambers at the rear corners. Interior finishes include original woodwork and wide chestnut floorboards. The house's ell was built about 1740 by Edward Cogswell, who came to the Griswold area in 1714 as one of its first settlers.

Set on of land, the farmstead retains the look and feel of an 18th-century farm property, with a c. 1741 farmhouse, and farm outbuildings dating from the 18th to 20th centuries. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 4, 1998. Description and history The Timothy Lester Farmstead is located in a rural setting of southern Griswold, at the junction of Crary and Browning Roads. The surviving 43 acres (of a once-larger farm property) are still lined with stone walls, and the farmstead itself is the only visible built intrusion on the landscape, which is gradually reverting to woodlands. The centerpiece of the farm complex is a -story wood- frame house, five bays wide, with a large central chimney. It was built in stages beginning c. 1741, and includes a two-story ell extending to the rear. It has an unusually large kitchen hearth with two beehive ovens. Adjacent to the house are a small wellhouse of great antiquity and an 18th-century barn. Across Crary Road from the house is another barnyard which includes several outbuildings in addition to a 19th-century barn. The property's agricultural development dates to about 1741, the year in which Mehitable Belcher married Timothy Lester. The property had been purchased from Mohegan natives in the 17th century, and acquired by Moses Belcher about 1720. The Lester family was prominent in area civic affairs, and this house served as a garrison and training ground during the American Revolutionary War. The Lester children were all signatories to documents petitioning for the separation of Griswold from Preston, which took place in 1815. The property was sold out of the Lester family in 1857, but remained in agricultural use until the mid-20th century.

History =The Shuler Press years= Arthur Silverton established Overfinch Bespoke Vehicles in 1975, in Farnham, Surrey under the name Shuler Presses. Initially, Silverton fixed what he perceived as imperfections inherent in the Land Rover's design. Silverton experimented with swapping the vehicle's Rover Engine for 4.4 V8 engines, a Jaguar V12 before settling on General Motors' 5.7 GM V8. Improvements were made to the vehicle's handling and Silverton installed a Ferguson FF anti-skid brake system. He also modified the interior to include pile carpets, leather upholstery and air conditioning. https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2018/09/06/overfinch-will-add- character-to-your-range-rover-inside-and-out/#5ecd8cee4402 Silverton changed the company name to Overfinch in 1985 and positioned the company as the de facto post-production modifier of Range Rovers. =Administration= In November 2010, the company was placed into administration, under the control of administrators Wilson Field, who said the business had incurred significant one-off non-trading costs which hit cash flow. Autobrokers Ltd of Leeds, who had been the company's largest retailer, using the name Overfinch Leeds, acquired the business and assets. Throughout the 2010s other luxury car makers such as Rolls-Royce, Bentley, and Lamborghini entered the luxury SUV market.

TCDD has a big fleet of covered goods wagons, flat wagons, tank wagons, open wagons and hoppers. TCDD also has a few schnabel cars and crane cars. TCDD carries freight such as bulk, shipping containers, liquids and goods. As of 2012, 25.7 million ton is transported by rail in Turkey. Two steel companies, Erdemir and Kardemir, top 2 customers of TCDD, had transported 4.5 million ton in 2012, mainly iron ore and coal. 2.1 million tons of rail freight belong to international traffic. Most of international traffic is between Turkey and Europe, done via Kapikule. Several container trains are running in this route as well as conventional wagons. Containers are widely used both in international and domestic transportation. 7.6 million ton is carried in containers. TCDD is supporting transportation by containers. Thus almost all of the private railway companies invested in container wagons, and carrying 20% of all rail freight by their own wagons. TCDD has plans to strengthen freight traffic by adding 4000 km conventional lines until 2023. That includes new international rail connections to Georgia, Iraq and Iran. TCDD is also constructing 18 logistic centers to enable transportation of more loads by rail. TCDD is planning to increase its transit traffic (11000 to in 2011) by constructing \\"iron silk road\\" to connect Europe to Asia. Marmaray is the most important part of this project which is supposed to complete in 2015. Another project is Kars‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìBaku railway which will be completed in 2014. TCDD wants to have share from the freight traffic between Europe and China. Container Lines to Europe As of May 2014, there are 3 companies organizing regular container trains between Turkey and Europe: IFB, Balo and Metrans. The weekly departures by these 3 companies is about 10 in each direction in total. By 16 June 2014 IFB ended direct container service to Turkey and started using vessel connection via Constanta powered by Global Multimodal. There are also other services started in 2014 such as intermodal trailer service by Ulusoy Logistics and swapbody train by Transfesa.

Also known as Francis Sartorius the Elder to distinguish him from his grandson Francis Sartorius Jr. (\\"the Younger\\").F. Sartorius the Elder (Artnet).

They are caused by either wind moving branches and/or leaves in the canopy or as the sun moves during the day. Although each sunfleck only last for seconds or minutes at a time, they can be responsible more than 80% of the photons that reach plants in the understory, and up to 35% of carbon fixation. This makes them important sources of energy for plants in the understory of forests. The amount of energy that a sunfleck provides depends on their duration, size and shape and the intensity of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), which itself depends on the arrangement of vegetation in the canopy and the position of the sun in the sky. The abundance of sunflecks varies greatly both within and between ecosystems, generally the frequency and intensity of sunflecks decreases as tree {i.e., plant or canopy} height and the leaf area index increase. There is no clear distinction between sunflecks and sunpatches, although the latter tend to last for at least an hour and the intensity of PAR reaches the full level of sunlight, whereas the intensity of PAR in sunflecks rarely reaches this. Because the amount of diffuse sunlight reaching the forest floor varies depending on the type of forest, there is no way to quantify an intensity of direct sunlight that qualifies as a sunfleck.

Its decisions are held normative for the national banking sector ‚Äì either directly by interbank treaties or indirectly by preparing a corresponding ministerial or Bundesbank decision.The German \\"Die Deutsche Kreditwirtschaft \\" is literally The German Services Sector / The German Banking Industry (the German word \\"-wirtschaft\\" is an abstract so the definite article \\"Die\\" / The needs to be part of the official title). As for English publications the hybrid term \\"German Banking Industry Committee\\" is used, even with its own abbreviation GBIC, see for example the 2012 update of the History Until August 2011, the association was known as the Central Credit Committee\\"Central Credit Committee\\" is the official English name used in publications of the ZKA ( / ZKA) when it adopted a new name (after almost eighty years).http://www.die-deutsche-kreditwirtschaft.de/dk/die-deutsche- kreditwirtschaft.html  Structure  The Central Credit Committee was founded in 1932 as a common interest group of the five federal interest groups that represent the financial sector in Germany. The five founding associations are: * ' (Federal Association of German Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken Co- operative Banks ‚Äì the credit unions) * Bundesverband deutscher Banken (Federal Association of German Banks ‚Äì the private banks) * Bundesverband √ñffentlicher Banken Deutschlands (Federal Association of Public Banks in Germany ‚Äì the regional / state banks) * Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband (German Association of Giro and Savings Banks) * Verband deutscher Pfandbriefbanken (Association of German Bond Banks) By indirection of these associations the Central Credit Committee represents 2,300 financial institutions (2005). The committee itself is not an institution ‚Äì it is neither registered, nor does it have a postal address. The committee presidency changes annually rotating among the associations for private banks, for savings banks and for co- operative banks. The Central Credit Committee resolves \\"common statements\\" (decided unanimously) representing the view of the German banking industry on a topic. The statements are published thereby influencing decisions of other institutions like the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, the Bundesbank or decision-making bodies of the European Union. Publication and press releases are the main task of the presiding association. Additionally the Central Credit Committee supervises joint committees of the German banking industry like the Central Competition Committee (Zentrale Wettbewerbsausschuss) or the Working Group on Automatic Teller Machines.  Standards in electronic banking  The Central Credit Committee has created the standards in electronic banking which are resolved by proposing agreements (Abkommen) that are joined by the banking institutions. Banking institutions that are members of one of the associations in the ZKA are naturally bound to join these. * Abkommen √ºber die Datenfern√ºbertragung zwischen Kunden und Kreditinstitute (DF√ú-Abkommen / RDT agreement - includes the EBICS protocol) * Vereinbarung √ºber den beleglosen Datenaustausch in der zwischenbetrieblichen Abwicklung des Inlandszahlungsverkehrs (Clearingabkommen / clearing agreement) * Vereinbarung √ºber die Richtlinien f√ºr einheitliche Zahlungsverkehrsvordrucke (payment blank form guidelines) * Homebanking-Abkommen (online banking agreement ‚Äì includes the HBCI protocol) * Abkommen zum √úberweisungsverkehr (direct credit transfer agreement) * Abkommen √ºber den Einzug von Schecks (Scheckabkommen / cheque agreement) * Abkommen √ºber den Einzug von Reiseschecks (Reisescheckabkommen / traveler's cheque agreement) * Abkommen √ºber den Lastschriftverkehr (Lastschriftabkommen / direct debit transfer agreement) * Abkommen √ºber den Einzug von Wechseln und die R√ºckgabe nicht eingel√∂ster und zur√ºckgerufener Wechsel (Wechselabkommen / promissory notes agreement) * Vereinbarung √ºber das eurocheque-System (arrangement on the eurocheque system ‚Äì practically defunct since 2002) * Vereinbarung √ºber die Absicherung der ec-PIN (arrangement on the eurocheque debit card safety ‚Äì later Maestro debit card) * Vereinbarung √ºber das deutsche ec-Geldautomaten- System (arrangement on the eurocheque cash machine system ‚Äì later called Girocard service) * Vereinbarung √ºber die Festsetzung einer H√∂chstgeb√ºhr f√ºr die Benutzung der instituts√ºbergreifenden Geldautomaten (arrangement on the maximum fees for interbank network cash machines) * Vereinbarung √ºber ein instituts√ºbergreifendes System zur bargeldlosen Zahlung an automatisierten Kassen (electronic-cash-System / arrangement on the electronic cash systems) * Vereinbarung zum POZ-System (arrangement on point of sale delayed debit systems) * Vereinbarung √ºber das instituts√ºbergreifende System ‚ÄûGeldKarte‚Äù (arrangement on the GeldKarte stored-value card system)  European Economic Area  The creation of the single market of the European Union (1993) and the introduction of the Eurozone (1999/2002) has made for a shift to make decisions on a European scale. As a consequence the European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS) was founded in December 1992 and the European Payments Council (EPC) was created in summer 2002. These drive the development of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) and the ZKA is supervising the EPC working groups by creating their own ZKA working groups mirroring the structure of the EPC.

At its two locations in the MuseumsQuartier and at Karlsplatz, it shows themed group exhibitions, and solo presentations of established and upcoming artists to provide insight into the Austrian and international art scene. History and architecture Kunsthalle Wien Karlsplatz Since it opened in 1992 ‚Äì originally shaped like a container ‚Äì Kunsthalle Wien, as an urban institution, presents national and international contemporary art. In this respect, it is both a location for established art and negotiation site for current societal issues as well as future developments. In the beginning, Kunsthalle Wien was a makeshift structure. Conceptualized as a temporary edifice in the shape of a container by Adolf Krischanitz. The initially rather controversial yellow container structure eventually changed the local art and exhibition scene. In May 2001, Kunsthalle Wien moved into its new headquarters, designed by the architect duo Ortner & Ortner, at the Museumsquartier. For this headquarters the Winterreithalle (winter riding arena) of the Hofstallungen (Imperial Mews) was extended by a functional annex which combines the historic building with contemporary architecture. Two halls with different interior profiles provide space for exhibitions of contemporary art. The entrance area was remodeled and the building extensively renovated in 2013, rendering the original spatial concept visible again. In 2001, the yellow container at Karlsplatz was replaced by a glass pavilion. Directors *since 2019: Ivet ƒÜurlin, Nata≈°a Iliƒá and Sabina Saboloviƒá *2012-2019: Nicolaus Schafhausen *1996-2012: Gerald Matt *1992-1995: Toni Stoos Art education and dramaturgy Kunsthalle Wien offers a range of programs to acquaint various target groups with the subjects and queries of contemporary art and stimulate audiences to explore the potential of fine arts. In cooperation with cultural institutions, schools, teachers, artists, and curators, the Kunsthalle Wien art education department has been developing a variety of projects and activities ‚Äì among them special seminars, workshops and the \\"Denkfabrik\\" (Think Tank). The Kunsthalle Wien dramaturgy department is a novelty in a contemporary art institution. It connects the various levels of Kunsthalle Wien, with its diverse exhibition formats and audiences, on a curatorial and educational level and thus helps to shape Kunsthalle Wien‚Äôs long-term concepts. Corporate design Kunsthalle Wien Karsplatz The corporate design of Kunsthalle Wien has been developed by the Belgian graphic designer and artist Boy Vereecken. Vereecken's approach links two different design elements associated with the city: the grid of the Wiener Werkst√§tte and the eagle from the federal capital's coat of arms. The logo of Kunsthalle Wien combines a graphically contentual derivation with an ironically playful execution to take account of an institution that always questions itself, experiments, and changes. 2014 Kunsthalle Wien won the German Design Award in the category \\"Communication Tool\\" with its new visual appearance, centring on an eagle that is constantly presented in different ways. Exhibitions Kunsthalle Wien organizes several thematic group exhibitions, solo shows, festivals, conferences, and displays art in the public space each year at both venues. Among them: * Stinking Dawn, by Gelatin and Liam Gillick (July - October 2019) * Death to Pigs, by Yhdessa Hendeles (February - May 2018) *Function Follows Vision, Vision Follows Reality (May ‚Äì August 2015) * Individual Stories.

It was here, while working at a wedding portrait studio, that Sellick mistakenly developed slide film in chemicals meant for print, and thus became an accidental pioneer of cross processing, the exaggerated colours that result from the process becoming Sellick's trademark in coming years. In 1990, his exploration of this method saw him become the first person to win both of the highest awards for portraiture in Australia in the same year'Epson commits to gallery tour to educate consumers on inkjet print quality', \\"http://www.epson.com.au/prographics/news/pressrelease/press_releases_details.asp?ID=508&Year;=2005\\" through the Australian Institute of Professional Photography, a feat he was to repeat the following year.National Portrait Gallery, \\"http://www.portrait.gov.au/site/exhibition_subsite_flash6.php\\" In 1992, Sellick was awarded a perfect score at the prominent 101st International Exhibition of Professional Photography in Chicago, and, that same year, used funds from a Young Achiever Award and a Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Grant to travel to New York,Kathleen Fisher, 'Artlook', November 2004 :http://www.merryngates.com/artlook/article.asp?contentID=519\\" where he would subsequently work as an assistant for Annie Leibovitz, Mark Seliger and Mary Ellen Mark.Craig Mathieson, 'The Age', 28 March 2005 \\"http://www.theage.com.au/news/Arts/Passion-behind-the- lens/2005/03/27/1111862256280.html\\" Career Returning to Australia in 1994, Sellick rose to commercial prominence in the burgeoning Australian magazine market, his portraits appearing regularly in magazines such as Vogue, Marie Claire, Who Weekly and Australian Style.'National Portrait Gallery of Australia',\\" http://www.portrait.gov.au/site/collection_info.php?searchtype=browse&searchstring;=Photography&irn;=1188\\" He was instrumental in developing a new visual aesthetic for Who Weekly as it transformed into a glossy, full-colour magazine, and his style became influential as Australia's magazine market became more sophisticated. Sellick's work has also been published internationally, appearing on the cover of magazines such as Q, NME and German Rolling Stone. A notable campaigner against what he refers to as \\"the vigorous pursuit of mediocrity\\" in Australian photography and its commercial industry (in 1995, he notoriously told Nancy Pilcher, then editor of Vogue Australia, that her magazine was \\"an international embarrassment\\", and never worked for Vogue again), Sellick is outspoken on the \\"lack of identity\\" in Australian photography. > \\"In Australia, magazine photographers do one of two things: they endeavour > to make photographs which resemble, as closely as possible, photographs > they've seen taken by other photographers in Europe or America, otherwise > known as plagiarism; and those not blessed with even that much talent choose > to make photographs which will never inspire or offend anyone in any way.\\" > \\\\- Excerpt from a speech by Robin Sellick at the National Portrait Gallery, > August 2009. Exhibitions Sellick's first major public exhibition, \\"Celebrity\\", held at Crown Casino in Melbourne in 2006, was the highest-attended event at the casino in that year. It was also the first major exhibition of celebrity portraiture by an Australian photographer outside of the National Portrait Gallery. The following year, Crown Casino invited Sellick back, the subsequent exhibition, \\"Exposing Robin Sellick\\", broking attendance records for the year 2007.

The software is designed to provide commodity web hosting in a distributed and fault-tolerant manner Hybrid Web Cluster video demo on a cluster of either real physical servers or virtual cloud computing infrastructure server instances. Features * Runs standard LAMP stack web applications. * Works on real hardware and virtualized cloud computing infrastructure. * Has a configurable level of replication redundancy. * Enables instant and automatic scalability. Technology This software splits each website and database into individual units of work - the load generated by each is monitored closely and the cluster automatically and transparently transfers websites and databases between cluster nodes such that no single node is ever overloaded. A single website can go from having no load at all to requiring its own dedicated web and database servers within seconds. Only one server is ever live for a particular website or database at any one time, enabling existing applications to run un-modified just as they would on commodity shared web hosting. Scalability The upper bound on the scalability of this system is that no single website can ever utilise more than two servers at once - under this condition all standard LAMP applications will run unmodified. However, it is possible to scale beyond this limit via the use of multi-master database replication - this requires that applications store all variable state information within a database - the database can then be live on many servers, the web application itself must remain static and can be served from as many nodes in the cluster as required. Redundancy It is possible to specify a redundancy invariant - this sets the number of machines in the cluster that should hold a copy of each website or database. By default this number is set to 2, this means that under normal operation all data will be held on at least two cluster nodes at any one time. If a cluster node fails, the system acts to automatically recover its data and resume web hosting within 15 seconds. This is achieved using the filesystem snapshotting capabilities of ZFS.London OpenSolaris user group talk Release Hybrid Web Cluster began beta testing in September 2010.Press release: Beta testing due to begin in September HybridCluster 2.0 was released on 1 May 2013.Press release: Immediate availability of version 2.0 of its integrated suite of storage, replication and web clustering software  See also  * Cloud computing * Cloud platform * Cloud infrastructure * ElasticHosts * Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud * Rackspace Cloud * GoGrid * FlexiScale References  External links  * Official site * Development blog Category:Cloud computing providers Category:Cloud platforms ","title":"Hybrid Web Cluster"},{"id":"28246128","text":"Dimitriadis 505 (1958) The Dimitriadis model 505 was a Greek microcar developed in 1958 by G.

It combines a physical QWERTY keyboard with a sliding multi-touch screen display and runs on BlackBerry OS 6. Introduced on August 3, 2010, the phone became available exclusively on AT&T; on August 12, 2010. The device looks similar to existing BlackBerry devices, but due to the sliding keyboard features a bigger 3.2 inch 480x360 screen (the same resolution as the BlackBerry Storm and BlackBerry Storm 2) and these features allow the BlackBerry Torch 9800 to look unique.Engadget BlackBerry Torch Review The software is seen by most to be an improvement over the previous version. The device also features far greater social network integration, a powerful universal search feature, and a WebKit browser comparable to those found on iOS and Android devices.Blackberry 6 features revealed in new RIM video On August 12, 2011, the updated Torch 9810 was released on Bell Mobility and Telus Mobility. The updated version includes a faster processor, and more memory, as well as including the new BlackBerry OS 7. History Speculation of the Torch began in April 2008 when RIM CEO Mike Lazaridis introduced the BlackBerry 6 operating system during his keynote address at WES 2010.Official BlackBerry 6 Preview Video From WES 2010!!  CrackBerry.com A new touchscreen device was widely anticipated as the OS 6 update seemed to be touch/gesture based. Images of a BlackBerry device prototype with a touchscreen and slide- out QWERTY keyboard started emerging in late spring and early summer of 2010. The device was tentatively named the \\"Bold 9800\\" or simply the \\"9800 Slider\\".BlackBerry 9800 (Torch, Slider) - Caught on video, yet again  CrackBerry.com The 9800 eventually was officially named the \\"Torch\\" by RIM during its August announcement. It can be assumed that the device name was derived from Torch Mobile, the company that RIM purchased in 2009 in aid with their development of a Webkit based browser.

However, upon release of the device's technical details, critics, such as PC World's Ginny Mies, were not impressed with the specifications which lagged behind new-generation devices such as the iPhone 4 and Droid X. One reviewer did not find enough difference over earlier BlackBerrys to recommend the device to new users.Gizmodo BlackBerry Torch Review Key complaints were the 624 MHz processor included in the Torch, whereas the HTC Evo 4G and Motorola Droid X (among others of their class) featured a 1 GHz processor. The Torch's 3.2 inch screen with 480x360 screen resolution was also criticized as being smaller than iPhone 4's 3.5 inch screen with 960x640 resolution and the Motorola Droid X's 4.3 inch with 854 x 480. The Torch has a screen that is the same size as the Storm and Storm 2 with a resolution the same as the Bold 9700, Bold 9650 and Tour 9630. Some critics also noted the lack of HD video recording and the lack of a front- facing camera. CNET's Bonnie Cha found improvements such as the better user interface, universal search and the much improved browser and multimedia experience. On the other hand, she also found that the smartphone can be sluggish, and could stand for some hardware upgrades, although her review was generally positive. RIM has stated that the processor in the Torch is 'of a newer generation',BlackBerry Torch review when boot times of the Torch and the BlackBerry Bold 9700 (both running OS6) are compared the Torch boots up 1.8 times faster than the Bold with the \\"older processor\\".BlackBerry Bold 9700 vs BlackBerry 9780 boot up comparison - YouTube UBM techinsite has confirmed the claims of Research in Motion, by performing a \\"tear down\\" and making a hardware analysis, discovering a PXA940 Processor. This processor is built on 45nm as opposed to the Processor found in the Blackberry Bold 1 and 2. The 45 nm process keeps heat production and power usage down, and the processor as previously stated in this article brings significant performance gains. Anandtech praised the screen of the phone as being: \\"one of the most readable outside that I've encountered in a while, with text and webpages being easy to make out even in intense daylight. Alongside the iPhone 4, the difference is pretty immediate, especially in how good white appears on the Torch compared to the iPhone4.AnandTech - BlackBerry Torch 9800 Review: Keeping RIM's Flame Alive Anandtech also noted that the contrast ratio was exceptionally good. Crackberry's Kevin Michaluk gave the BlackBerry Torch an overwhelmingly positive review stating that the Torch is a \\"worthy device for any smartphone owner\\".BlackBerry Torch Review  CrackBerry.com Crackberry praised OS 6.0, the form factor, touchscreen, and the Webkit browser. However, Michaluk criticized the lack of HD video recording and lack of OpenGL support for 3D graphics. Sales Initial sales of the BlackBerry Torch were slow to moderate, with AT&T; Wireless Operations president expressing some disappointment in the sales stating that he was \\"surprised there hasn't been a faster adoption\\" of the smart phone by the public.AT&T; Disappointed with BlackBerry Torch, Blames iPhone Estimates put sales at somewhere between 100,000 and 150,000 devices sold during the first week of release. However, sales reportedly improved in the months following the release and RIM shipped a record amount of smart phones in the final quarter of 2010. The BlackBerry Torch placed 6th place on Wirefly's annual top ten selling smart phones list for 2010, selling more than Motorola's Droid 2 and Samsung's Galaxy S Fascinate, but behind devices like the Evo 4G and Droid Incredible.

The neighbourhood is close to the River Thame. History The development is on the area of land to the north of Aylesbury where the Battle of Aylesbury is reputed to have taken place in 1642. Because of this special attention was paid to the area in the pre-construction archaeological excavation carried out in 2008, however only 24 musket shot were found. However, as the 247 bodies of the dead soldiers who had lain in that field were reburied in Hardwick in 1818, it is likely that any artefacts would have been reburied with them. In plans for the new estate roads have been named after important figures from the battle, including Prince Rupert Drive and Colonel Grantham Avenue. Housing development Building of the Weedon Hill housing development started in 2007. As of 2015, approximately 1,000 homes have been completed out of 1035 planned dwellings, as well as a community centre, primary school, parks and play areas and a private care home .

The building is now occupied by The People's Story Museum and The Tolbooth Tavern, the building is protected as a category A listed building. History The tower of the tolbooth was built in 1591, and the block to the east of it at that time or slightly after, by Sir Lewis Bellenden, baron of Broughton and feudal superior of the burgh of Canongate and Lord Justice Clerk of Scotland. It was the courthouse, burgh jail and meeting place of the town council. In 1875 the City Architect, Robert Morham, extensively restored and remodelled the exterior. Internally the first and attic floors were combined to make a single floor, now The People's Story Museum.

Established in 1973, the wine club was created by a quartet of British-born Canadians who felt that the selection of wines available in Canada was a poor representation of the quality of wines available worldwide. Marketed as ‚ÄúCanada‚Äôs largest wine club,‚Äù Opimian has grown since its inception, now acting as Canada's largest wine buying group with 20,000 members (and growing). Overview The name ‚ÄúOpimian‚Äù derives from the Roman consul, Lucius Opimius, who discovered the famous 121 BC vintage and gave it only to discriminating wine connoisseurs. Like Lucius Opimius, Opimian sources premium wines on behalf of their members. A purchasing co-operative, they access the diversity of the world's wines within the constraints of the government monopolies and controls. = In the Community = Opimian is divided into 27 regions, called Opimian Chapters, across Canada, each with a volunteer representative called an Area Representative. The volunteers organize local tastings and create a ‚Äúsocial dimension to membership.‚Äù Opimian's mandate is to provide wine education. In March 2008, the Board of Directors voted to make a donation to the Niagara College Foundation. The donation was made in two parts ‚Äì a $20,000 Scholarship, titled ‚ÄúThe Opimian Society Scholarship‚Äù and a $30,000 donation toward the building of the Wine Education Center. The Opimian Society Scholarship was received by one person in 2009 and two people in 2010 and 2011. = Impact on Canada = Liquor boards and consumers have used Opimian as a de facto test market for new brands. Spain's Freixenet, Australia's Rosemount Estate and Scotland's The Macallan all started out as Opimian selections before becoming mainstays in the Canadian market. Opimian is a quietly influential national wine-buying club that has aided in sophisticating the adult-drink trade in Canada. Wine Eight times a year, members receive catalogues of the wines offered by Opimian. The catalogues are referred to as ‚ÄúCellar Offerings‚Äù and feature different regions. = Cellar Offering = This is marketed as an educational guide that will provide members with information on wine regions, grapes, vineyards and winemakers; the vehicle for their tasting notes, food pairing tips and cellaring advice. Graphic charts instruct the reader on proper serving temperatures and storage life for the wine. All Opimian wines are sourced by a Master of Wine, Opimian's wine consultant. The Master of Wine is responsible for selecting each of the wines offered, sourcing new suppliers, providing tasting notes, Maturity & Drinkability ratings and answering any wine related questions from members. The wines offered are not available anywhere else in Canada, thus one does not see mainstream, well-known or documented brands. Foreknowledge of purchases is further constrained by a lack of independent ratings and reviews for the wines. = Working with the Provincial Liquor boards = Opimian has always co-operated with local alcohol monopolies. All Opimian wines are officially imported and cleared by the respective liquor boards in each province, ensuring that all taxes and liquor mark ups are included in the pricing.

He was the father of the composer Emil Horneman and grandfather of C. F. E. Horneman, also a composer. Biography Horneman was born on 15 August 1765 in Copenhagen. He attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1780, winning its small silver medal in 1785, and its large silver medal in 1786. In 1787 he went abroad to further his studies and it would take sixteen years before he returned to Denmark. He specialized in portrait miniatures. He experienced the outbreak of the French Revolution first hand in Paris in 1789. He also visited Italy and Vienna, where Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein and Heinrich F√ºger were among the artists who inspired him. In Berlin he learned a new technique, most likely from Daniel Chodowiecki, which he often used in his later work. In 1803 Horneman returned to Denmark and the following year he was appointed miniature painter to the Royal Danish County. In 1805 he became a member of the Academy and in 1816 he was given free residency at Charlottenborg. He was made a professor in 1835. In his later years he suffered from poor health and from 1840 he received an annual pension. He is buried at the Garnisons Cemetery in Copenhagen. Works While abroad he had the opportunity to make portraits of a few of the leading figures of his day, including Ludwig van Beethoven (1802) and Joseph Haydn, while he made sketches of several others in a sketch book now kept at the Danish National Gallery. The portrait of Beethoven was painted in 1803 as a miniature. Beethoven was very fond of the result, possibly because he is very good looking in it compared to later representations, and sent it to , a school friend, in the hopes of reconciliation one year after the portrait was completed. After his return to Denmark he was one among several portrait painters who filled the void after the death of Cornelius H√∏yer and Jens Juel. He made miniatures and particularly pastels which was the technique in which he did his best works. In the 1820s he also turned to lithography.

During the 1960s Winkelstein was considered one of the leading epidemiologists of the time. Winkelstein was born in Syracuse, New York, the son of a prominent lawyer. After graduating from the Putney School, he served in the U.S. Army during World War II. He subsequently attended the University of North Carolina, where he majored in sociology. He then attended Syracuse University for medical school, graduating in 1947. He also obtained a Master's of Public Health from Columbia University in 1950. After working in Buffalo, New York for several years under Abraham Morris Lilienfeld, he accepted an appointment at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, serving as Dean of the school from 1972 to 1981. Winkelstein has made important contributions in a number of areas of epidemiology. Early in his academic career, he participated in clinical trials of the polio vaccine. During his time in Buffalo, Winkelstein studied the health impact of the city's air pollution, successfully separating the effect of pollution from other confounding social and environmental factors, and also contributed greatly to the understanding of coronary artery disease in women. At Berkeley, Winkelstein did pioneering research on the link between tobacco smoke and cervical cancer. It took over two decades for those findings to be widely accepted. In the 1980s and thereafter, Winkelstein's work was focused mainly on HIV and the AIDS pandemic. Winkelstein led the San Francisco Men's Health Study, one of the largest and best-described cohorts of people at risk for HIV/AIDS. By studying this cohort, Winkelstein and his collaborators were able to contribute greatly to the understanding of the epidemiology of HIV and AIDS, in particular the modes of viral transmission, risk factors for progression to AIDS, and duration of the incubation period. Winkelstein also addressed Peter Duesberg's arguments that AIDS was related to drug use rather than HIV infection, demonstrating, along with immunologist Michael Ascher and other colleagues, that \\"such claims have no basis in fact.\\" Since retiring and assuming emeritus status, Winkelstein worked on biographical sketches of major figures in the history of epidemiology, including John Snow, Edward Jenner, and his mentor, Abraham Lilienfeld. He died in 2012 at home in Point Richmond, California of complications of an infection at the age of 90.

Formerly the canal and the ramparts on the city side formed the outer defenses of the city. Name The name is related to the Dutch word omsingelen, \\"to surround\\", and comes ultimately from Latin cingulum, meaning \\"belt\\". Other Dutch towns also have ring-shaped canals named Singel. History and course After the fourth expansion of the canal ring around 1660, the outer canal ‚Äì with the ramparts that formed the defenses ‚Äì became the boundary of the city. Within these ramparts there were strongholds on which mills were placed. As a result, the canal had a curvy course. Parallel to the Singelgracht, on the inside of the ramparts lay the Lijnbaansgracht, named after the lanes that lay there. Parts of the strongholds were demolished and the canal was straightened there. The old winding course can still be recognized in a few places. Of the mills on the strongholds, two remain, both moved to new locations: De Gooyerat to the Zeeburgerstraat in Amsterdam-Oost and De Bloem to the Haarlemmerweg. For two centuries, Amsterdam had a characteristic crescent-shaped layout. In the last quarter of the 19th century, Amsterdam expanded beyond the Singelgracht. The ramparts were demolished and Marnixstraat, Weteringschans and Sarphatistraat were developed. Bridges The section of the Singelgracht between the Westerkanaal and the Rotterdammerbrug is part of the shipping connection (standing mast route) between the IJ and the Kattensloot / Kostverlorenvaart, with movable bridges on either side of the Willemspoort . The other bridges over the Singelgracht are fixed bridges. Confusion with the Singel  The Amsterdam Singelgracht is often confused with the Singel. The canal called the Singel forms the border of the medieval city center parallel to the Herengracht. The Singelgracht is the waterway that borders the entire Center. The name only indicates the canal, not the adjacent built-up quays. Partly for this reason the name is less known than that of other canals. On the outside of the canal are the Nassaukade (west), Stadhouderskade (south) and Mauritskade (east); on the center side the Marnixkade , Leidsekade, Nicolaas Witsenkade, Sarphatikade , Huddekade, Spinozastraat and Alexanderkade.

Born in Kilkenny, Ireland, O'Reily studied for the priesthood in Dublin. Upon his ordination in 1869, he migrated to Western Australia, serving as a parish priest in Fremantle, and founding a Catholic newspaper there. When the Diocese of Port Augusta was established in 1887, Pope Leo XIII named O'Reily as its first bishop. Concerned about the financial position of the diocese (which had inherited significant debt from the Diocese of Adelaide), he accepted the posting reluctantly. As bishop, he greatly improved the financial position of the new diocese, reducing its debt by half and earning a reputation as a competent administrator. In 1894, O'Reily was appointed to replace the deceased Christopher Reynolds as Archbishop of Adelaide. The archdiocese he inherited was burdened with substantial debt, again left over from the old Diocese of Adelaide. Through the sale of church assets and a fundraising campaign, O'Reily was able to eliminate most of the Archdiocese's liabilities while still investing in church infrastructure. He also actively participated in public discussions relating to education policy at a time when the role of the state in supporting religious education was topical. O'Reily publicly advocated government assistance for religious schools, stating that it was unfair Catholics paid taxes to support state schools, but received no funding for their own. In the later years of his life, poor health forced him to spend less time attending to his episcopal duties, and from 1905, he largely retreated from public life. At his request, Robert Spence was appointed as his coadjutor and successor in 1914, and on 6 July 1915, he died at his house in Adelaide. O'Reily was highly regarded by many in South Australian society, with Adelaide's daily newspapers praising his character, administrative ability and positive relations with non-Catholics. Early life O'Reily was born John O'Reilly on 19 November 1846, in Kilkenny, Ireland, the son of Michael, a military officer, and Anne, n√©e Gallagher. He completed his primary education at the parochial school of St. John's Parish, and spent six and a half years at St Kieran's College. Due to poor health, he decided against pursuing a military career, and in 1864 he entered All Hallows College in Dublin to study for the priesthood. He learnt Irish, and studied mental philosophy, mathematics and ecclesiastical studies, achieving first prize in each of his classes. After being ordained on 21 June 1869, he left Ireland for Western Australia in October, arriving in January 1870. Having served briefly in Newcastle (present day Toodyay) and Northam, he became a parish priest in Fremantle, establishing the West Australian Catholic Record in 1874 and serving as its publisher, editor and printer from 1883.  Bishop of Port Augusta  left Following a recommendation from the first plenary council of Australia and New Zealand in 1885, in May 1887 Pope Leo XIII elevated the Diocese of Adelaide to an Archdiocese and metropolitan see. As a suffragan diocese to Adelaide, the Pope established the rural Diocese of Port Pirie, naming O'Reilly as its inaugural bishop.Press 1986, p. 235. Upon his appointment, O'Reilly travelled to Adelaide, where he met with the Archbishop of Adelaide Christopher Reynolds and the Cardinal of Sydney Patrick Moran to discuss the formation of the new diocese. The poor financial state of the Archdiocese made the discussions contentious, with O'Reilly concerned about the amount of debt Port Augusta would inherit from Adelaide. To ensure a sufficiently large population for the new diocese, Moran suggested that its boundaries be altered from those drawn up by the Pope, but Reynolds opposed this plan.Press 1986, p. 237. Dissatisfied with the outcome of the discussions, O'Reilly decided to travel to Sydney to deliberate further with the Cardinal, prompting Reynolds to write to Moran: On 27 October, O'Reilly wrote to Pope Leo XIII requesting permission to reverse his decision to accept the appointment to Port Augusta, believing he would be unable to administer a diocese with such significant debt and such a small, impoverished population. In addition, he wrote, he had no personal wealth to contribute to the finances of the diocese. The concerns O'Reilly raised prompted Cardinal Simeoni of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith to call for an official church inquiry into the financial situation of the South Australian dioceses.Press 1986, p. 238. The report found a total of almost ¬£38,000 of debt, with the new Port Augusta diocese bearing ¬£18,000.Press 1986, p. 249. Following the report, O'Reilly's request was refused, and on 1 May 1888, he was consecrated in St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney. Later that year, in an effort to save time while signing documents, O'Reilly removed an \\"l\\" from his surname. Although the Sisters of St. Joseph operated eight primary schools in the Diocese of Port Augusta, it was without a Catholic high school‚Äîboarding or otherwise. Accordingly, while he was staying in Sydney for his consecration, O'Reily sought to establish a convent for the Sydney-based Sisters of the Good Samaritan in Port Pirie. At the bishop's expense, the order's Mother-General spent two months in Port Pirie, and once she had found appropriate living quarters, a school was established, teaching over 100 students. A convent for the sisters was completed in 1890 on the same block as the school.Press 1986, p. 242. Upon his return to South Australia, O'Reily immediately set about improving the financial situation of the Diocese of Port Augusta.Press 1986, p. 239. He requested financial assistance from the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith,Schumman, 1990. and divided the diocese into fund- raising districts, campaigning for contributions in each of them.French 1975. With the permission of Archbishop Thomas Carr in Melbourne, O'Reily toured parishes in Victoria asking for funds for his new diocese.Press 1986, p. 240. By 1893, he had reduced the diocesan debt by half, with his peers describing him as a \\"practical, clear-headed man of business\\" due to his administrative ability. While Bishop of Port Augusta, O'Reily showed an interest in education policy. He authored a pastoral letter on the matter in March 1889, and the next year gave a speech criticising the lack of government funding for Catholic schools. According to O'Reily, it was unfair and unjust that Catholics paid taxes to support state schools but received no government support for their own. O'Reily's views on education were frequently cited when the Free Education Bill (which aimed to make state schools free) came before the South Australian Parliament in 1890, but the cost of the scheme meant that the bill was not passed. Although there was some discussion of funding for religious schools when the bill was reintroduced the next year, these proposals failed to gain significant parliamentary support, and in 1891, the bill was passed without assistance for religious schools. O'Reily suffered a long and serious illness through early 1894 and continued to suffer from migraines throughout the year, forcing him to delegate many of his duties to James Maher (his vicar general) and John Norton (an official consultor)Press 1986, p. 244. who would later become, respectively, the second and thirdPress 1986, p. 246. Bishops of Port Augusta.  Archbishop of Adelaide  After suffering a two-year illness, Archbishop Reynolds died in June 1893,Bickerton 1976. and by January 1894, rumours of O'Reily being appointed as his successor were published in Port Augusta papers. Although he dismissed such speculation, a letter of appointment arrived from Rome in March, naming him as the next Archbishop of Adelaide. = Archdiocesan finances = As Bishop of Port Augusta, O'Reily had fought to minimise the debt inherited from the old Diocese of Adelaide. Having reduced the new diocese's debts by half in his six years as bishop, upon becoming Archbishop of Adelaide, O'Reily found the rest of the old diocesan liabilities awaiting him, their size having actually increased. In 1895, he presented a report on the state of the archdiocesan finances to the Sunday congregation in St. Francis Xavier's Cathedral, revealing total liabilities of just over ¬£37,000. O'Reily reckoned ¬£10,000 could be paid off by selling land owned by the Archdiocese. Two weeks after his address, a meeting of Adelaide Catholics supported moves to liquidate the archdiocesan debts, with ¬£3,600 pledged at that meeting, including ¬£1,000 over four years from O'Reily himself, a significant portion of his income.Press 1986, pp. 251‚Äì253. Since the sale or mortgaging of church land required an act of Parliament, in 1896, the South Australian Parliament unanimously approved The Catholic Church Endowment Society Incorporated Sale of Lands Bill. This allowed the Archbishop to make good on his intention to sell all diocesan land not used for church purposes, and over the next few years, land, surplus vestments and works of art owned by the Archdiocese were sold off. These sales, combined the efforts of the Archbishop and diocesan priests to secure donations from around the Archdiocese, meant that by 1901 O'Reily was able to report that the debt had been reduced by three-quarters. This had been achieved at the same time as expenditure was being made on new schools, churches and other diocesan buildings. In fact, O'Reily noted in his report for that year that the remainder of the debt could have been removed had expenditure been cut, writing: = Education policy = As Archbishop, O'Reily continued his participation in public discussions regarding education. In 1896, a colony-wide referendum sought to gauge public opinion on state education, scripture reading in state schools, and the provision of capitation grants (fixed grants per student) to non-state schools. O'Reily weighed into the debate in The Register, giving conditional support to scriptural instruction in state schools, so long as the teachers themselves were religious and Catholic students received instruction from Catholic teachers. On the subject of a capitation grant, O'Reily was strongly supportive, arguing that moral impediments prevented Catholics from using secular education, and that, since religious schools provided elements of secular education as well as religious instruction, they should receive government assistance. At the referendum, South Australians affirmed the system of free secular education, but rejected scriptural readings in schools and the capitation grant. O'Reily blamed the Labor Party for the loss of the capitation grant. According to O'Reily, the serving Premier Charles Kingston could have been convinced to support the grant were it not for the objections of Labor, with whom Kingston had formed a coalition government.French 1977. In 1899, in the lead-up to that year's general election, O'Reily gave a speech criticising the Labor Party, accusing some Labor leaders of having \\"an evident disposition to crush [Catholic labourers] with successive burdens.\\"  Later life and legacy  Archbishop O'Reily, c. 1910 In 1904, O'Reily travelled Europe to make his ad limina visit to Rome, and to visit his native Ireland where he was made a freeman of Kilkenny. Due to poor health, from 1905, O'Reily kept to himself in his house in Glen Osmond, leading to the local press referring to him as the \\"Recluse of Glen Osmond\\". Increasingly, his episcopal duties were fulfilled by Bishop of Port Augusta John Norton, who would have to visit the more remote parts of O'Reily's see on his behalf. As he became more frail, O'Reily would ask certain priests to accompany him when he travelled, among whom was the Dominican prior Robert Spence. When O'Reily requested a coadjutor in 1913, he chose Spence as his first preference for the role. Despite the reluctance of some clergy to the appointment of a religious as Archbishop, Spence was consecrated as coadjutor, with right of succession, in August 1914.Press 1991, p 155. O'Reily died on 6 July 1915 at his house in Glen Osmond, and was buried under a large Celtic cross at the West Terrace Cemetery. During his time as Archbishop, O'Reily had formed positive relationships with many senior members of South Australian society, including the Anglican Bishop of Adelaide Nutter Thomas, and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of South Australia, Samuel Way, who considered him a friend.Laffin 2008, p.103. In an editorial in 1913, The Advertiser praised O'Reily, lauding his administrative abilities and crediting the good relations between Protestants and Catholics in South Australia to his \\"broadness of mind and to his quiet determination to avoid all unnecessary controversy.\\" Upon his death, The Register gave a glowing editorial, describing him as \\"loveable and highly estimable\\", a \\"hard hitter\\" and asserting that, had he not been a religious leader, he could have been \\"a leading financier, Imperial legislator or even an eminent military commander.\\"  Notes   References      External links  *O'Reily, John at the Australian Dictionary of Biography, Online Edition. *Archbishop John O‚ÄôReilly at catholic-hierarchy.org.

It is listed at grade II. Located at numbers 64A and 64B on the north side of Welsh Row (at ), it is entered via its former stable entrance, The Gateway. Currently divided into two houses, the Porch House has previously served as a day and boarding school, and as a house for Belgian refugees. The existing building stands on the site of a 15th-century mansion of the same name. Nikolaus Pevsner considers Welsh Row to be \\"the best street of Nantwich\\".Pevsner & Hubbard, p. 289 The street has many listed buildings and is known for its mixture of architectural styles,Bavington et al., plate 55 including timber-framed black-and-white cottages such as the Wilbraham's and Widows' Almshouses, Georgian town houses such as Townwell House and number 83, and Victorian buildings such as the former Grammar School, Savings Bank and Primitive Methodist Chapel. History The existing Porch House was built on the site of a 15th-century mansion, also known as the Porch or Porche House. Until the early 21st century, Kingsley Fields (now a housing development) lay behind Porch House, and local historian James Hall considers that the original building might have been occupied in around 1400 by John Kingsley, a turbulent character who was a prominent Nantwich resident, holding part of the Barony of Nantwich between 1405 and 1431.Hall, pp. 92‚Äì93, 172Lamberton & Gray, p. 16Garton, pp. 35‚Äì42 A follower of Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, Kingsley fought against Henry IV at the Battle of Shrewsbury of 1403, but later obtained the king's pardon and became squire and later sergeant to Henry V, fighting for the king in Normandy in 1415 and subsequently. Henry Wettenhall of Dorfold, a member of one of the town's most important families, inherited the Porch House mansion in 1470.Garton, p. 50 In the early and mid 17th century, it was the home of the Masseys and Wrights, also among the principal families of Nantwich.

History In 1964, the American plastic surgeons T.D. Cronin and F.J. Gerow reported the first breast augmentation procedure using silicone gel-filled implants. In that implantation procedure, the breast implant devices were inserted through an incision to the inframammary fold (IMF), where the breast meets the chest of the woman. In 1972, J. Jenny described a periareolar-incision emplacement technique for inserting the breast implants via an incision under the nipple-areola complex (NAC). In 1973, Koeller described a transaxillary breast implant emplacement technique effected by means of an incision to the axilla. In 1991 the trans-umbilical breast augmentation was invented and first performed by Dr. Gerald W. Johnson in Houston Texas. T.U.B.A is a technique for the implantation of saline breast implants through a small incision at the woman's navel. The trans-umbilical emplacement approach is a technical variant of the abdominal tunnel technique employed for inserting breast implants, which was described in 1976, which facilitated the inserting and emplacing of empty saline implants to the breast-implant pocket. Surgical technique A trans-umbilical breast augmentation is a breast prosthesis insertion technique wherein the incision is at the umbilicus (navel), which dissection then tunnels superiorly, to facilitate emplacing the breast prosthesis to the implant pocket without producing visible surgical scars upon the breast hemisphere; but it makes appropriate dissection and device-emplacement more technically difficult. A TUBA procedure is performed bluntly (without endoscopic assistance), and is inapplicable to emplacing (pre-filled) silicone-gel implants, because of the great potential for damaging the elastomer silicone shell of the breast- implant device during its manual insertion through the short, two-centimetre (~2.0 cm), incision at the navel, and because pre-filled silicone-gel implants are incompressible, and cannot be inserted through so small an incision. ;Advantages The scar is produced in a remote location (the navel). ;Disadvantages The TUBA (Trans-umbilical Breast Augmentation) approach is inapplicable for the emplacement of incompressible, pre-filled breast implants, usually of the silicone-gel-filled variety. There is felt to be somewhat less precision with this approach in developing the breast pocket as compared to traditional incisions. Future surgeries or difficulties encountered during the initial surgery likely need to be addressed through a different incision.

If approved, the line is expected to be commissioned in 2021. The venture, being developed by Transmission Developers Inc. (TDI), a Blackstone Group, L.P. (Blackstone) portfolio company, would carry clean energy - hydropower and wind power from eastern Canada - and feed it directly in the New York City electricity market. Construction costs for this project are estimated at US$2.2 billion for the section located in the State of New York. The Quebec section of the line would be built and operated by Trans√ânergie, the transmission arm of Hydro-Qu√©bec.  Background  Power rates in the New York metro area and Long Island have long been among the highest in the U.S. and according to the U.S. Department of Energy, the city is the \\"epicenter\\" of grid congestion in the eastern United States. The congestion problem in the New York City area and on Long Island is compounded by the fact that the area uses two-thirds of the state's electricity while most generation and import capacity is located upstate and near the Great Lakes. Over the years, a number of proposals to increase transmission capacity to the New York City and Long Island markets have encountered hostile reactions and determined opposition from environmental groups and communities along the planned paths. For instance, construction of the Cross Sound Cable, a 328-MW submarine DC cable linking Connecticut to Long Island via the Long Island Sound, was authorized in 2002, but its commissioning was delayed for a year because of a dispute involving the promoter and the state of Connecticut. Another project, the Neptune Regional Transmission System has been operational since 2007. The 500 kV cable connects New Jersey and Long Island. It runs buried in the Atlantic Ocean and has a capacity of 660 megawatts. A proposed HVDC line, West Point Partners, that would have interconnected the grid from a substation in Athens, New York to a substation near the Indian Point Energy Center was tabled when the landowner where the southern converter station would be located, Con Edison, sold the land to the Village of Buchanan. The Village of Buchanan then sold the rights to use the land to the natural gas company Spectra for their new proposed natural gas pipeline. However, a 400 kilovolts DC line between the Rock Tavern substation, 60 miles north of New York, and the Marcy hub in central New York, has been marred by controversy. Launched in 2006, the proposed New York Regional Interconnect (NYRI) had a 1,200 megawatts capacity. It was shelved by its developers in early 2009 after two years of staunch opposition from several groups concerned by the impact of pylons along the proposed route.  Project  TDI, whose board is chaired by former Ontario Premier David Peterson, is backed by Blackstone and was announced on February 23, 2010. Since then, the CHPE Project has made significant progress in terms of securing the governmental approvals. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authorized the Project developers to sell transmission rights at negotiated rates in July 2010. Less than a year later, the New York State Department of State issued its Coastal Zone Consistency determination for the project. =Settlement= On February 24, 2012, the parties participating in the detailed review of the project being conducted before the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) announced that they had reached a settlement of all of the issues in the proceeding. On April 18, 2013, the New York State Public Service Commission granted the CHPE project a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need. The CHPE project tries to avoid difficulties encountered by other proposals by presenting itself as an \\"environmentally benign\\" solution. By avoiding overhead wires and 10 story high towers, the promoter hopes to avoid the fate of previous projects, such as NYRI. The initial project involved two 1,000 MW lines, the first one to New York, and the second going all the way to Connecticut, via the Long Island Sound. The construction cost for the two lines and converter stations in the U.S. was estimated at $3.8 billion. The line to Connecticut was cancelled in July 2010. According to the company's president and CEO, Donald Jessome, choosing an underwater route avoids \\" disrupt[ing] communities with overhead transmission\\". The developer says that the cable also provides economic and environmental benefits to the state, bringing low-cost and clean power to critical load centers.

As this is an agreement with a foreign country, his approval was needed. In continuation, as of September 2017 the newly elected Donald Trump administration has also not addressed this issue. Part of Iona Island which contains a bird sanctuary is to be blasted to make way for CHPE project. Three planned CHPE cooling stations are to be located in a state park in the Haverstraw/West Haverstraw vicinity. Residents of this area are also concerned about property seizures under eminent domain. There is also opposition from New York labor unions because most construction jobs will go to workers from out of State. The Atlantic chapter of the Sierra Club has asked its members to oppose this project. New York wind energy producers currently cannot get their electricity carried to the New York City. It is the Sierra club's contention that CHPE will stop any chance of New York City getting locally produced wind power and in general dampen the market for local alternative energy production.\\"Stop CHPE: No need to import Canadian energy from 1,200 miles away\\" in the Sierra Atlantic Volume 41 Spring 2015 = Route = The proposed cable would have a length of approximately between the Canada-U.S. border and its southern terminal, in New York City. The two cables would be buried at varying depths of under Lake Champlain and the Hudson River, Harlem, and East Rivers. The cables would cross the border under Lake Champlain and would run southward to the Town of Dresden north of the Village of Whitehall. On its way to the Hudson, the cables would be routed briefly taken along State Route 22 and then parallel the Delaware & Hudson Railroad right-of-way to Rotterdam, at which point it accesses the right-of-way of a CSX Transportation rail line, continuing southwards until it enters the Hudson River in the Town of Catskill. Once the cables are in the Hudson River, they continue south to the Town of Stony Point, where the CSX railroad right-of-way is again relied on until the cables re-enter the Hudson in the Town of Clarkstown. The cables next make landfall in the Harlem River Intermodal Yard in the Bronx, traverses the East River to reach Queens, and terminates at a converter station on the large energy campus in the Astoria neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens. = Economics, emission levels, and reliability = In an economic analysis filed on behalf of the promoter to the New York Public Service Commission in July 2010, London Economics International estimates that the projected line would save New York customers $8.1 billion (2010) on their electricity bills over the first 10 years of operations, between 2015 and 2024. In addition, the proposed cable would have positive impacts on the electricity grid, since power carried by the cables could force the retirement of older, uneconomic power plants in New York. The planned line, which would carry 7.64 terawatt-hours of renewable electricity per year, would lower emissions by 6,800 tonnes, emissions by 10,800 tonnes and emissions by nearly 37 million tonnes during the first decade of operation. A study released by TDI in February 2012 concludes that the CHPE will create hundreds of jobs directly and thousands of indirect and induced jobs. The Project will also reinforce the reliability of New York's bulk power delivery system. The proposed CHPE project has applied to the U.S. Department of Energy for a Presidential Permit, and to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for permits issued pursuant to the federal Clean Water Act and Rivers and Harbors Act, and hence, is subject to the requirement that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) be prepared. The CHPE EIS is of an Environmental Impact Statement currently under preparation. = Hydro-Qu√©bec's position = According to the promoter, the Quebec section of the line would start at a DC conversion station to connect with Hydro-Qu√©bec Trans√ânergie's Hertel substation (735-315 kV) near La Prairie, and would reach the junction point at the international border in Lake Champlain. The initial reaction of Hydro- Qu√©bec (HQ)and the Quebec government to the CHPE project was first met with some skepticism, considering the 400 to 500 million Canadian dollars price tag for the Quebec section of the line. In addition, the CHPE could be seen as competing with a proposed 1,200 MW HVDC line to be built by the company in association with NSTAR and Northeast Utilities, which is expected to increase exports of Quebec hydropower to New England. Reflecting on the project in April 2010, Hydro-Quebec's CEO, Thierry Vandal, stated that it was technically \\"very complex\\" and \\"very costly\\". Despite its mixed initial reaction, the Quebec utility intervened in support of the proposal before the FERC in May 2010, and the PSC in March 2012.[18] In the March 2012 letter, HQ cited the CHPE project's potential to bring large quantities of renewable energy to downstate New York at no cost to New York ratepayers and the CHPE project's progress before the PSC as the reasons for entering into \\"active discussions\\" with TDI. Late in January 2013, Hydro-Qu√©bec formally filed a project notice to build the Quebec part of the line to the Quebec Minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks, Yves-Fran√ßois Blanchet. The ¬±320 kV power line would start at the Hertel transmission station, near La Prairie, to reach the US border on the shore of lake Champlain. The project includes the deployment of a DC terminal at Hertel TS, but in contrast to the US part of the line, Hydro-Qu√©bec excludes running the line in the Richelieu riverbed.

Marsy, then 21, was a senior at UC Santa Barbara and had come home to Pt. Dume, Ca., for Thanksgiving when Conley, with whom she had broken up, shot her to death. Conley was subsequently convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 17 years to life in prison, where he died in 2007.Los Angeles Times In the nearly 2-year interim between the murder and the trial, Conley remained free on bail, a fact that was particularly painful to his victim's family, as he was frequently seen around the neighborhood where Marcella Leach and her husband, Bob Leach, still lived. In one particularly wrenching incident, Marcella Leach recalled being shocked when she encountered Conley in a neighborhood grocery store shortly after the murder. Among those who comforted the Leach family was Ellen Griffin Dunne, the mother of actress Dominique Dunne, who had been strangled to death by a spurned ex-boyfriend the year before Marsy's death. When Dunne decided in late 1983 to create a local support organization for the survivors of homicide victims, the Leaches were among the founding members, along with Marcella Leach's son Henry Nicholas.Nelson, p1 The California Center for Family Survivors of Homicide was formed as a nonprofit, with a subgroup, Justice for Homicide Victims, as its public face. The Leaches assumed leadership of Justice for Homicide Victims in 1990, after Dunne, who suffered from multiple sclerosis, moved to Arizona, where she died in 1997. Bob Leach served for many years as the president of Justice for Homicide Victims, and Marcella Leach was its longtime executive director. During the 1990s, the organization continued to push for improved law enforcement and longer penalties for convicted felons, including California's Three Strikes Law.Simon, p1 By the late 1990s and early 2000s, with Leach as executive director, the group claimed some 10,000 members.

He is Professor of Religion and Nature at the University of Florida and has also been an Affiliated Scholar with the Center for Environment and Development at the University of Oslo. Taylor works principally in the areas of religion and ecology, environmental ethics and environmental philosophy. He is also a prominent historian and ethnographer of environmentalism and especially radical environmentalist movements, surfing culture and nature-based spiritualities. Taylor is also Editor-in-Chief of the Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature and subsequently founded the International Society for the Study of Religion, Nature and Culture, serving as its President from 2006-2009. He also founded the Society‚Äôs affiliated Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature and Culture, serving as its editor since 2007. Dark green religion Taylor is credited with coining the term \\"dark green religion\\" or \\"dark green spirituality\\", which he broadly defines as a religion, or a \\"religion-resembling\\" set of beliefs and practices, characterized by a central conviction that \\"nature is sacred, has intrinsic value, and is therefore due reverent care.\\"Taylor, Bron (2010). Dark Green Religion: Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future. University of California Press, Berkeley. Tied in with this belief is a felt kinship with non-human entities and a conscious awareness of the interconnected and interdependent nature of life on the planet. Taylor argues that dark green religion possesses many of the characteristics of established religions, such as sacred texts (a book such as Walden, for example), prophets (writers and activists such as Henry David Thoreau, John Muir and Rachael Carson), rituals (\\"soul surfers\\" meeting the ocean at dawn) and elements some consider dangerous (radical \\"eco-terrorists\\"). Dark green religion also has an inherently political component with regards to environmentalism; the idea that nature is sacred comes with an ethical responsibility to treat it as such. As outlined in Dark Green Religion: Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future, Taylor asserts that belief in the sacrality of nature may or may not involve a belief in supernatural beings or forces. An atheist who reads evolution as an epic narrative of spiritual significance may be engaging in dark green religion, as would a pantheist who is humbled by the structure of the cosmos. Those who perceive the Earth to be like an organism if not also a sentient being (Gaianism), or intuit that animals and trees possess spiritual intelligences (animism), may also be viewed as engaging in dark green religion, according to Taylor. Dark green religion often finds common ground with religious traditions such as paganism and shamanism, as well as philosophical belief systems such as deep ecology, Aldo Leopold's theory of land ethic, and James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis. Taylor's conviction that \\"religion\\" is a paradigm that can be understood to include entirely naturalistic worldviews puts him at odds with many of the new atheist thinkers such as Christopher Hitchens and especially Richard Dawkins, whom he discusses directly in his book. Taylor contends that dark green religiosity has deep roots and has manifested itself in a diversity of ways throughout human history. He finds eco-spiritual synchronicity, for example, in phenomena as seemingly disparate as surfing magazines and the writings of Edmund Burke. Other cultural actors and elements explored by Taylor include Charles Darwin, Jane Goodall, Edward Abbey, Alice Walker, tree-sitting activists, the Earth Liberation Front, the Animal Liberation Front, Al Gore, Orion magazine and Disney films such as The Lion King and Pocahontas. Taylor has also written about James Cameron's film Avatar and its relevance to dark green religion. He argues that the widespread popularity of the film, in which nature is regarded as sentient and sacred, is a testament to the growing appeal of dark green spirituality around the world.Taylor, Bron. \\"War of the Worldviews: Why Avatar Lost\\", Religion Dispatches, 11 May 2010. Taylor also finds an emerging global receptivity to dark green religious sentiment in political institutions such as the United Nations. He has observed that, as concerns over the state of the environment intensify, global summits aimed at addressing the ecological crisis have assumed a decidedly spiritual tenor. He points to the opening ceremony of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development as one example of this trend. \\"Welcome Ceremony at the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development,\\" Johannesburg, 25 August 2002. He argues that current trends in earthen spirituality might even presage the emergence of a ‚Äúcivil earth religion‚Äù that promotes loyalty to the biosphere rather than to nation states.Taylor, Bron. \\"Reconsidering Civil Religion, The Politics of Spirituality: Civil Earth Religion Versus Religious Nationalism\\", The Immanent Frame, 30 July 2010. =Dark green versus green religion= Taylor makes a distinction between dark green religious phenomena (which emanate from a belief that nature is sacred), and the relatively recent \\"greening\\" of certain sectors of established religious traditions (which see eco-friendly activities as a religious obligation). Many of the central figures and seminal texts of dark green religion, as curated by Taylor, express a strong condemnation of Abrahamic theism, which, dark green religionists allege, as Lynn Townsend White, Jr. did in a famous Science essayWhite, Lynn Townsend Jr. \\"The Historical Roots of Our Ecological Crisis\\" , Science, Washington, D.C., 10 March 1968. in 1968, is deeply linked to an anthropocentric worldview that sees human beings as above nature and divinely endowed with the right to dominion over the biosphere. Those aligned in the dark green religion camp have alleged that this cosmogony has played a major role in the desecration and exploitation of the natural world. For this reason, those engaged in dark green religion are often skeptical that conventional religions can play a constructive role in halting and reversing ecological degradation. While the environmentalist efficacy of the stewardship model, which some think is mandated by Judaism, Christianity and Islam alike, remains a hotly disputed issue,Jacobs, Tom. \\"A New Genesis: Getting World Religions to Worship Ecologically\\" , Miller-McCune, 29 April 2009. many dark green thinkers believe that efforts to preserve the ecosystem will not succeed unless underlying spiritual attitudes are shifted towards a more biocentric perspective. To this point, in a 2010 interview with the online magazine Religion Dispatches, Taylor stated, \\"Although it is not my intent to annoy those with conventional religious understandings, few such religionists will welcome the evidence assembled in Dark Green Religion, or my supposition based on this evidence, that eventually their religions are likely to be supplanted by naturalistic forms of nature spirituality.\\"Taylor, Bron. \\"Losing Old Gods, Finding Nature\\", Religion Dispatches, 21 January 2010. Taylor has thus drawn criticism from those who believe that conventional religious ethics and infrastructure can be effective agents of environmental preservation.

John Francis Sartorius (fl. 1775-1831), was an English painter of horses, horse-racing and hunting scenes, a member of the celebrated Sartorius family of artists. Life and work Coursing at Hatfield John Francis was the son of artist John Nott Sartorius and grandson of Francis Sartorius. His younger brother Francis Sartorius Jr. (\\"the Younger\\") was a marine artist. He was less successful than his father with regard to the number of his patrons, though his thorough knowledge of sport is exemplified in his sporting pictures. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in London in 1802, when he was residing at 17 King Street, Holborn. Afterwards he sent occasional contributions until 1827, the total number of pictures exhibited by him being 16. Several of his paintings were engraved in The Sporting Magazine but as his father's works were appearing in the same periodical, and John Scott was engraving for both, it is somewhat difficult to differentiate the son's pictures from the father's, particularly as many of the plates were signed 'Sartorius' only. One of the best known of his pictures is 'Coursing in Hatfield Park,' exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1806, and depicting Emily Cecil, Marchioness of Salisbury, who rode daily in the park up to her eighty- sixth year.

It can be mounted on armored fighting vehicles, field fortifications, command posts, permanent air and vehicle sheds, and ammunition and fuel depots by infantry with no special equipment. According to NII Stali (Scientific Research Institute of Steel), which designed Nakidka, it reduces the chances of detection by day/night viewers and TV systems and seekers by thirty percent, infrared seekers by two- to three-fold, radar by six-fold, and reduces the thermal-radar signature to near-background levels. Nakidka is efficient in the optical, IR and radar wavelength bands up to , and also reduces the radar cross section by 10 db. Nakidka weighs and can be deployed in 0.4‚Äì1.0 man hours per square meter. It is also capable of withstanding combat conditions, such as taking small arms fire or a napalm attack. It is said to have a long maintenance-free service life. In 2006, during the Russian Expo Arms and International Defense Exhibition of Land Forces, a T-72BM \\"Rogatka\\" (an upgraded T-72B) fitted with Nakidka was demonstrated. A T-72B and a T-90S fitted with a signature reduction package based on Nakidka were also featured. Since then, that \\"signature reduction package\\" has become a standard component of the T-72B. To reduce its visibility, the new 2S19M2 artillery self-propelled howitzer uses a set of camouflage system to reduce the thermal heat of the vehicle and increase protection against radar, thermal and optical detection by more than 1.5 times, thereby reducing the effectiveness of high-precision weapons. Because the addition of cage armor would normally negate the camouflage properties of Nakidka, NII Stali offers special rubber side screens which would fit over cage armor and reduce the vehicle's visibility further.
