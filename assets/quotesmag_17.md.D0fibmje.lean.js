Her mother Bella Bailey, who was 86, was admitted to Stafford Hospital in September 2007 with an enlarged hernia and died there on 8 November 2007. She helped to form an organisation, Cure the NHS, which successfully campaigned for a public inquiry into the failings at the hospital. She ran a dog grooming parlour and a small cafe, Breaks, on Lichfield Road in the centre of town, which became the headquarters of the campaign. She and her supporters plastered the walls with photographs of dozens of elderly men and women – husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters – who they claimed had died unnecessarily at the hospital because of lack of care. She was nationally praised for her determination to shine a light on the failings of the Trust. In Stafford some people have blamed her for a planned downgrade of the town’s hospital. She says she suffered abuse in the streets. However police dropped the investigation into the alleged harassment claim as they could not find sufficient evidence. In 2012 Bailey authored a book called \\"From Ward to Whitehall: the Disaster at Mid Staffs Hospital\\", the story of her fight for the truth to be uncovered about the situation in Mid Staffs Hospital and her struggle to improve it.

Scope  The area stretches from the edge of London and the North Downs in the north to the edge of Brighton and the South Downs in the south, and from Horsham in the west to East Grinstead in the east. It benefits from two Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty: the Surrey Hills and the South Downs National Park. It has an area of some 400 square miles and a population of 680,000; its economy generates £20.7bn GDP. 12 million people live within one hour's drive. There are 406,000 economically active people in the Gatwick Diamond; 81% of the working age population is economically active. 74% of Gatwick Diamond workers are residents (annual population survey 2011). The unemployment level is very low at 1.4%. The Gatwick Diamond is home to 45,000 businesses including many UK and European Headquarters. Some of these companies are: Unilever, Exxon Mobil, Toyota, Doosan, Thales Group, Varian Medical Systems, Elekta, Nestle, EDF Energy, Edwards Vacuum, Canon Inc. and G4S. It also contains the Manor Royal Business Park – the largest business park in the UK,Manor Royal Homepage housing 550 businesses and employing around 35,000 people.  Initiative  The Gatwick Diamond Initiative is a business-led private/public partnership that was established in April 2003 to improve the economic performance of the area.Gatwick Diamond Initiative It now includes seven local borough/district councils (Horsham, Crawley, Mid Sussex, Tandridge, Reigate & Banstead, Mole Valley and Epsom & Ewell) and two county councils (West Sussex and Surrey), as well as a range of private sector partners. One of its first actions was to arrange a meeting of the principal stakeholders (both public and private sector) to determine what actions could be taken to improve the economic performance of the area. Business leaders considered that the first priority should be to give the area an image and identity. The Initiative therefore launched the \\"Gatwick Diamond\\" on 15 July 2004. Since then the term \\"Gatwick Diamond\\" has achieved widespread recognition and acceptance. It was first referred to in parliament by Nicholas Soames, MP for Mid Sussex, on 13 Jun 2006.Hansard https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060613/halltext/60613h0002.htm The Gatwick Diamond Initiative lobbies government and the public sector on issues that prevent businesses in the area from growing; they encourage international trade; promote, attract and help UK and foreign inward investors looking to locate in the area; campaign on issues such as Air Passenger Duty, Gatwick's second runway and the Gatwick Express; and encourage the three Further Education colleges at Redhill, Crawley and Epsom to work together with the University of Brighton and University for the Creative Arts to provide Higher and Further Education to meet business needs.  Economy  The Gatwick Diamond area is situated directly south of London and covers the east of Surrey and northwest of Sussex. The heart of the area is 30 miles from Central London. By rail, the Gatwick Express can get to Central London in 30 minutes. Gatwick Airport is situated at the centre of the Gatwick Diamond and is a nominal 1 hour's drive from Heathrow Airport, subject to frequent delays on the M25. The Gatwick Diamond is within 1 hour from the sea ports of Shoreham and Newhaven and 90 minutes from Dover, Southampton and Portsmouth sea ports. By road, the M23 bisects the Gatwick Diamond and is just 10 minutes from the M25. By bus, the Metrobus Fastway service takes many employees in the Gatwick Diamond to their workplace; coaches leave Gatwick to reach 400 UK towns and cities. The Gatwick Diamond is an economic area worth £20.7bn GDP (growing at 3% per year), with a population of 680,000.  Gatwick Airport  Gatwick Airport has 48 airlines which fly to 200 destinations, more than any other UK airport. The airport connects to 45 out of 50 top European destinations and over half of the world’s emerging markets. In 2014, the airport had 38.6 million passengers pass through it. This contributes towards Gatwick being the busiest single-runway airport in the world. The airport's railway station was used by 18 million passengers in 2015-16, making it the busiest airport station in the UK.  The Gatwick Diamond Business Association  The Gatwick Diamond Business Association (until 2012, the Crawley and District Industry Association) offers networking opportunities at its monthly members' meetings. It operates like the other membership organisations in the area such as the Chambers of Commerce, Sussex Enterprise and Surrey Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses, but concentrates on the Gatwick Diamond area.

It is a Grade I listed building. History A peel tower was built on the site in 1362. The present house dates back to around 1404 and was built as a fortified tower house. In 1568, Mary, Queen of Scots wrote a letter from Workington Hall to Queen Elizabeth I of England. After the defeat of her forces at the Battle of Langside and disguised as an ordinary woman, Mary crossed the Solway Firth and landed at Workington. She spent her first night in England as an honoured guest at Workington Hall. On 18 May 1568, Mary was escorted to Carlisle Castle after spending a day at Cockermouth. She was 25 years old. Additions to the house were carried out by John Carr in the 1780s and the gardens were laid out by Thomas White at around the same time. In the early 19th century the lord of the manor at Workington Hall was John Christian Curwen, born John Christian, who inherited the hall from Eldred Curwen in 1790 and took the Curwen name. He was Member of Parliament for Carlisle from 1786 to 1812 and from 1816 to 1820, following this with a period as member for Cumberland from 1820 to 1828. Workington changed radically both economically and socially, during the period when John Christian was lord of the manor (1783–1828). A Curwen through his mother's side, ...he is the man who stands out...who must rank as one of the most interesting and progressive of Cumbrians of his day. The hall remained the family home of the Curwen family until 1929 when it passed to the Chance family by marriage. The hall was requisitioned by the War Office at the start of the Second World War and suffered a serious fire while the troops were billetted there. The family passed the hall over to Workington Borough Council after the War so it could be used as a Town Hall but conversion to this use never happened.

The colt showed promising form as a two-year-old in 1978, winning the Anglesey Stakes and being narrowly beaten by the English-trained Tap On Wood in the National Stakes. In the following year he emerged as the best Irish racehorse of his generation, winning the Ballymoss Stakes and the Irish 2000 Guineas in Ireland in spring and the weight-for-age Eclipse Stakes in Britain in July. He also finished runner-up to the outstanding English-trained colt Troy in both The Derby and the Irish Derby. At the end of his three-year-old season he was sold and exported to the United States where he made little impact as a racehorse and proved to be a disappointment as a breeding stallion. Background Dickens Hill was a chestnut horse with a white star and white socks on his hind legs bred by Frank Flannery's Egmont Stud in County Cork. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Mount Hagen, a horse owned and bred by Daniel Wildenstein, which won the Prix du Moulin in 1974. His dam London Life was a poor racehorse (rated 65 by Timeform) but a better broodmare, producing several other winners including Miralife, who finished third in the Irish 1000 Guineas and produced Miralla. As a yearling, the colt was sent to the Houghton sale at Newmarket where he was bought for 34,000 guineas by representatives of Mme Jean-Pierre Binet. He was sent into training with Mick O'Toole, best known for his handling of National Hunt horses including the Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Davy Lad, and for his willingness to gamble heavily on his charges. The colt's name was originally rendered as Dickins Hill. Racing career=1978: two-year-old season= After finishing third to Miami Springs and Gerald Martin on his racecourse debut in the Tyros Stakes, Dickins Hill recorded his first success by beating Cabinbinini by a length in a six furlong maiden race at the Curragh in July. In August, the colt was moved up in class for the Group Three Anglesey Stakes over the same course and distance. Before this race the spelling of the colt's name had been changed from Dickins Hill to Dickens Hill. Ridden by Wally Swinburn, he won by one and a half lengths from Card Game, with the rest of the field well beaten. In September, Dickens Hill started second favourite for the Group Two National Stakes at the Curragh. He was beaten a head by the English-trained Tap On Wood, although the result was only confirmed when the racecourse stewards overruled an objection by Swinburn, who alleged that the winner had caused interference in the final furlong. The beaten horses included Sandy Creek, who went on to win the William Hill Futurity. Dickens Hill face Tap On Wood again when he was sent to France and moved up to Group One Class for the Grand Critérium at Longchamp Racecourse on 8 October. Starting a 22/1 outsider he dead-heated with Le Marmot, six lengths behind the winner Irish River. =1979: three-year-old season= Dickens Hill began his second season in the Vauxhall Trial Stakes over seven furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse, in which he finished second to Gerald Martin. He was then moved up in distance and tested against older horses in the ten-furlong Ballymoss Stakes at the Curragh. In the closing stages, he carried his head at a high, awkward angle but won by three quarters of a length from the John Oxx-trained five-year-old Orchestra. On 12 May, Dickens Hill started 5/2 second choice in the betting behind the odds-on favourite Gerald Martin in the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh. The race was run on exceptionally heavy ground: the previous day's card had been cancelled as the turf course had been so waterlogged that it was considered unsafe for racing. Ridden by Tony Murray, Dickens Hill took the lead two furlongs from the finish and won by four lengths despite throwing his head from side to side after going to the front. The value of his victory was questioned by some observers on account of the extreme conditions and the fact that the runner-up, Brother Philips, was a 200/1 outsider with little worthwhile form. On 6 June, Dickens Hill started at odds of 15/1 for the 200th running of the Derby Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. The colt was settled in fifth place before accelerating in the straight, taking the lead a furlong from the finish and looking the likely winner. He was quickly overtaken by Troy on the outside and was beaten seven lengths but held on to second place, finishing three lengths ahead of the French-trained Northern Baby in third. The other beaten horses included Ela-Mana-Mou, Tap On Wood and Son of Love. Dickens Hill faced Troy again in the Irish Derby at the Curragh on 30 June. On this occasion, Murray held up the colt at the back of the field before moving through the field to challenge Troy approaching the final furlong, but Dickens Hill again proved no match for the English colt and was beaten four lengths into second place. Seven days after his defeat at the Curragh, Dickens Hill started 7/4 second favourite for one of Britain's most prestigious weight-for-age races, the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse. He was re-opposed by Northern Baby, while the older horses included the favourite Swiss Maid (the top-rated three-year-old filly of 1978), Stone (winner of the Gran Premio del Jockey Club and the Premio Presidente della Repubblica) and Crimson Beau (winner of the Prince of Wales's Stakes). Murray tracked the leaders before sending Dickens Hill past Northern Baby and Crimson Beau to take the lead a furlong from the finish. In the closing stages, he stayed on under pressure to win by two lengths from Crimson Beau, with Northern Baby a length away in third. Dickens Hill was then aimed at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in October and did not run again until 22 September when he started the 1/2 favourite for the Joe McGrath Memorial Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse. He ran very poorly, reverting to his old habit of throwing his head in the air, making no progress in the closing stages and finishing fifth of the six runners behind the four-year-old Fordham. He was subsequently found to be suffering from a respiratory infection. He did not race in Europe again, being sold to representatives of the Kentucky-based Gainesway Farm and exported to the United States. =1980: four-year-old season= In 1980, Dickens Hill was campaigned in the United States where he was trained by H. Allen Jerkens. He raced twice in Florida in March, but failed to reproduce his best European form, finishing third in an allowance race at Hialeah Park Race Track and third behind Morning Frolic and Pearlescent in a three-way photo finish for the Canadian Turf Handicap at Gulfstream Park. Assessment In 1978, the independent Timeform organisation gave Dickens Hill a rating of 112, placing him twenty-two pounds below their top-rated two-year-old Tromos. In the Irish Free Handicap, he was rated the seventh-best two-year-old colt to race in Ireland, eleven pounds below Sandy Creek. In the following year he was rated 130 by Timeform, seven pounds behind Troy. In the official International Classification, he was rated the best three-year-old colt in Ireland and the seventh-best three-year-old colt in Europe. Stud record Dickens Hill was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at Gainesway Farm. He made very little impact as a sire of winners, with his most successful performer being the steeplechaser Victorian Hill. The best of his flat race performers were Hudson Newes (Kingston Stakes) and Tropical Whip (Woodlawn Stakes).

The first are longer walking routes, most of which are maintained by the Palatine Forest Club (), or PWV, and which are linked to the national and international network of long distance paths.Übersicht Fernwanderwege und regionale Wanderwege Website by Hilmar Schmitt, linked also by the Website of the Palatine Forest Club. Retrieved 11 April 2011 The second category are those local circular walks and themed walking routes, some of which are of wider regional importance, and which are maintained by municipal authorities. The Palatine Forest, as part of the Palatine Forest-North Vosges Biosphere Reserve, is an important conservation area. As a result, the Palatine Forest, the bunter sandstone landscape of the Palatine Forest Nature Park, the castles in the Dahner Felsenland and the cross-border paths into Alsace and the Vosges make the region particularly popular with ramblers and walkers.1:25,000 and 1:50,000 topographic map series by the Rhineland-Palatinate Department of Survey and Geobasis Information at their official website. Retrieved 1 April 2011  Long distance paths  This section lists those long distance paths that run through the Palatine Forest. = International long distance paths = Path through the Karlstal valley along the Moosalb 16px The Palatine Ways of St. James are two historic pilgrimage routes from Speyer to Santiago de Compostela, signed by waymarks with a white scallop on blue field (German: Weiße Muschel auf blauem Grund), the symbol of Saint James. The historic, northern route ran along the Speyerbach, through the Frankenweide and the Karlstal valley towards the Landstuhl Marsh, past the pilgrimage church in Vogelbach, via Karlsberg to Homburg and from there via Hornbach Abbey to France. The present-day, less well known southern route runs partly along the Klingbach stream, through the Wasgau, and along the French border to Hornbach Abbey. 16px 16px The E8 European long distance path from Ireland to Turkey runs through the state of Rhineland-Palatinate from the north along the River Rhine to the Donnersberg hill, then via Worms in the Odenwald (Hesse). An alternative E8 southern route runs through the Palatine Forest, as follows: * along the Nahegau-Wasgau- Vosges long distance path (white cross) from Niederhausen an der Nahe via the Donnersberg and Hochspeyer to Johanniskreuz, and * along the red cross trail from Johanniskreuz over the Eschkopf and Edenkoben to Speyer.Naturpark Pfälzerwald, Wander- und Erlebniskarte 1:50,000, . 16px The international Nahegau-Wasgau-Vosges long distance path is waymarked by a white cross and runs from Niederhausen an der Nahe over the Donnersberg, the Schorlenberg, via Hochspeyer and Waldleiningen to Johanniskreuz (to here it is part of the southern branch of the E8 European long distance path). From Johanniskreuz, the trail runs via Leimen and Münchweiler an der Rodalb to Pirmasens.

From there it continues via Hinterweidenthal and the Neudahn Castle ruins, through Dahn, Bruchweiler and Rumbach to the French border at the Emperor William Rock (Kaiser-Wilhelm-Stein). The trail is designated as GR 53 on the French side and runs in several stages through the Alsace to the summit of the Donon. 16px The international Staudernheim-Soultz- sous-Forêts long distance path is signed with a blue bar and heads from Staudernheim on the River Nahe, through the Palatinate to Soultz-sous-Forêts in Alsace. 16px The international Pirmasens-Belfort long distance path is waymarked by a yellow bar and runs Pirmasens to Belfort south of the Vosges. Details of the various stages of the route are given below. = National long distance paths = Helmbachweiher 16px The Saar-Rhine-Main long distance path (Fernwanderweg Saar-Rhein-Main) is signed with a yellow cross and runs through the Palatine Forest and Rhenish Hesse to the River Main, more specifically from Homburg via Höheinöd, Waldfischbach, the Hundsweiher Sawmill and the Schwarzbachtal to Johanniskreuz. From there it continues through Elmstein, along the Helmbach to Erfenstein, then via Lambrecht to the Palatine Forest Club hut of Lambertskreuz.

It is possible to switch to another route. These signs are, however, rather uncommon.  Certified paths  The Palatinate Tourist Office worked in cooperation with the Association of German Mountain and Hiking Clubs (Deutscher Wanderverband) on the routes for three certified paths which were opened in April 2011, two of which run through the Palatine Forest: * The Palatine Wine Path (Pfälzer Weinsteig, 153 km, ten one-day stages) runs from north to south from Neuleiningen along the Haardt mountains to Schweigen- Rechtenbach. * The Palatine Forest Path (Pfälzer Waldpfad, 142 km, nine one- day stages) runs from Kaiserslautern through the Palatine Holzland and the Wasgau also to Schweigen-Rechtenbach. = Themed walks = The Monk's Way (Mönchsweg) themed walk near Hochspeyer * Baumwipfelpfad (\\"Treetop Path\\") – at the Fischbach Biosphere House. The path, for which a fee is payable, runs through the trees and treetops at heights of up to 35 metres for a distance of 270 metres. Nearby there is a Water Experience Way (Wasser-Erlebnis-Weg). * Waterway trail on the Moosalbe (Gewässerwanderweg an der Moosalbe) – this is one of seven walks on the subject of water engineering in Rhineland- Palatinate. The way runs for over 33 km along the Moosalbe and Hirschalbe streams. Information provided by the Ministry for the Environment and Forests at various waypoints covers the topics of: :*Mills, weirs and springs, :*Springs, water structures and ecosystems. * Rätselhafte Zeitzeichen – historical themed walk by the municipal authorities of Enkenbach-Alsenborn and Hochspeyer, with the following sections: :* Hochfelsweg (\\"High Rock Way\\") (12 km) :* Keltenweg (\\"Celtic Way\\" and Römerweg (\\"Roman Way\\") (9 km) :* Mönchsweg (\\"Monk's Way\\") I (12 km) und Mönchsweg II (14 km) :* Schanzenweg (\\"Fieldwork Way\\") (13 km) :* Sonnwendweg (\\"Solstice Way\\") (9 km) * Skulpturenweg Rheinland-Pfalz (\\"Rhineland-Palatinate Sculpture Way\\") – this sculpture walk is planned in future to run through the whole of Rhineland-Palatinate. It currently comprises local sections. These are found in the Palatine Forest at: :*Schweinstal, Krickenbach, Queidersbach :*Trippstadt, Stelzenberg :*Trippstadt, Johanniskreuz * Spurensuche (\\"Tracking\\") – four forest history walks in the Johanniskreuz forest district: :Footpath (Weg) 1 (yellow, 21 km, 21 stations) via Lauberhof, Karlstal and Meiserhof. :Footpath 2 (red, 14.5 km, 21 stations) via Erlenbach and Eschkopf. :Footpath 3 (blue, 19.5 km, 21 Stations) via Dämmchen, Mückenwiese and Speyerbrunn. :Footpath 4 (green, 19 km, 22 Stations, not from Johanniskreuz, but Trippstadt) via Antonihof and Aschbacherhof. *The Rodalber Felsenweg (\\"Rodalb Rock Way\\", circular path, 43.305 km, 5 stages are recommended that increase the total length, including approach and departure routes to 61.9 km) was laid out by the Palatinate Forest Club and the municipalities of Rodalben in the early 1990s. It snakes through various side valleys around Rodalben and passes 26 bizarre rock formations of bunter sandstone that are typical of the region. In 2007 it was elevated by the German Rambling Association to a certified trail. *The Brunnenwanderweg (\\"Fountain Trail\\") near Heltersberg: the trail was opened in 2009 and is 40.3 km long, has 64 theme-related stations and in the area around the village of Heltersberg. The 30 or so voluntary renovated fountains form the highlight of the path; other features include near-natural, unique mixed woods and bizarre rock formations (crags and blockfields). The cultural historic background to the trail is documented on detailed information boards and a guide brochure.Begleitbroschüre des Brunnenwanderweges (pdf; 5.8 MB) Heltersberg website. Retrieved 12 April 2011 = Local footpaths = Many villages and municipalities in the Palatine Forest have marked out local footpaths. These circular routes are usually waymarked with numbers and are of short to medium length, mainly used by local people. The care of these circular walks (waymarking, clearing) has been very neglected in recent years due to lower demand and tighter budgets. As a result, some can only be located with the aid of topographic maps.  Common waymarking systems  Since the foundation of the Palatine Forest Club and the Vosges Club (French: Club Vosgien) about 100 years ago, both rambling clubs have used almost identical waymarking systems. As a result, not only are cross-border walks made very easy but it also supports the fact that the Palatinate Forest and the Vosges form a single unit from both a geomorphological and a topographical perspective, and should therefore really only be viewed as two halves of an overarching mountain range on the left bank of the Rhine.Kurt Reh: Der Pfälzerwald - Eine Einführung in Landschaft und Namengebung.

This trick was first recorded in India in the early 19th century. Early performers This illusion was first recorded by Thomas Frost in Lives of the Conjurors, 1876, as a performance by an old Brahmin in India in 1828 or 1829. The Brahmin died in 1830 without explaining his trick. He was followed by Sheshal, the Brahmin of the Air, who exhibited the illusion at Madras in 1832, apparently using only a stool, a hollow piece of bamboo, a piece of hide and some beads (pictured). Frost thought that it was \\"probably not very far from the truth\\" that there were supporting steel rods concealed within the bamboo and the hide, and that the rods were connected with a seat concealed within the performer's robes. The performer was set in place behind a screen. =Ching Lau Lauro= The first recorded instance of it in Europe was performed in 1832 or 1833 by Ching Lau Lauro in England, and known as sitting in the air upon nothing.Encyclopædia Britannica 1911: Conjuring Ching Lau Lauro was first to perform Aerial Suspension Illusion 1835. The same encyclopedia entry for conjuring can also be seen here In an early version, he appeared to be just touching his hand against some beads hung on a hollow bamboo pole, which in turn was set in a wooden stool. In reality the bamboo, his hand and loose Chinese or buffo costume concealed iron bars, connections and supports. He had to be placed in position behind a screen, and where necessary would forbid sales of tickets to a particular theatre gallery to prevent the audience from seeing any iron bars or supports protruding behind him.EB Classic Encyclopaedia 1911 Retrieved 14 December 2013 By 1835 he had omitted some of the singing from his act and worked up the illusion as a climax. He developed it so that he could juggle with golden balls at the same time. =Robert-Houdin= Robert-Houdin's ethereal suspension In Robert Houdin's version, known as ethereal suspension, he appeared to administer ether to an assistant who was then shown to balance horizontally in the air with an apparently inadequate support at the shoulder only. Robert-Houdin asserted that he was the first to perform this type of illusion in 1849, but this was later discredited by Harry Houdini. Later performers In the 1870s and 1880s, Alexander Herrmann (1844–1896) and his wife Adelaide performed an adaptation of aerial suspension which they called Trilby. P. C. Sorcar (1913–1971) performed a Floating Lady routine featuring aerial suspension in 1964.

Through her use of everyday objects, she explores the relationship of tradition and modernization.Suzuki, Sarah (2010). \\"Lin Tianmiao\\". Modern Women: Women Artists at the Museum of Modern Art. New York: Museum of Modern Art. pp. 405–406. . Growing up in China as well as being a woman are the two strongest voices that Lin communicates with and advocates for through her art. By using materials which are closely tied to the maternal responsibilities of a household, Lin connects her past to China's present.  Biography =Early life= Lin Tianmiao was born in 1961 in Taiyuan, Shanxi province, China. Her father was an ink painter and master calligrapherPollack, Barbara (October 2012). \\"Wrap Artist\\" (PDF). ARTnews. pp. 86–93. and her mother studied and taught traditional dance. She earned a bachelor's degree in Fine Art from Capital Normal University in Beijing in 1984. Lin worked and lived in New York from 1988 to 1995. She now resides in Beijing. =Personal life= She lived in Brooklyn from 1988 to 1994. She returned to Beijing in 1995 and converted her home into an open studio which was an important venue for Apartment Art. Lin is married to video artist Wang Gongxin and has a son, Shaun. She lives in Beijing. Lin and her husband work together and he runs her website as well as is in charge of her publicity. They also collaborate on experimental exhibitions in their home that further investigate the materials that Lin is drawn to and often uses in her work. = Education = She received her BFA from Capital Normal University in 1961. Subsequently she studied at the Art Students League in New York City in 1989. =Career= Lin started her career as a textile designer and used the skills she learned later on in her work. She transitioned from textile design to art because she felt like design was limiting her creativity and suppressing her expression.Wang, Peggy. 2012. \\"Subversion, culture shock, \\"Women's Art\\": an interview with Lin Tianmiao\\". n.paradoxa. 2012: 22-31. Lin and her husband participated in and were involved with the Beijing Young Artists' Painting Society, which was contiguous with the '85 Art New Wave Movement. \\"It was more conservative, but it was also innovative\\" said Lin in an interview about her involvement in the Beijing Young Artists' Painting Society compared to the '85 Art New Wave Movement. Lin co-founded the Loft New Media Art Center in 2001. She had a 2006 residency at the Singapore Tyler Print Institute where she experimented with paper media and printmaking. Since the mid-1990s, her works have been included in every major international museum show on Chinese contemporary art. Lin is represented by Galerie Lelong, New York and Paris.  Artwork = Medium= In the 1990s, Lin created works with materials of contrasting textures. Her signature medium became undyed cotton thread. Lin also works in other mediums such as sculpture, photography, video and mixed media. More or Less the Same, 2011 combines hard and soft materials such as silk threads and stainless steel and demonstrates a balance in textures. In 2017, after a twenty year practice, she made a break from the traditional media she became associated with, instead choosing to use glass—a man-made material widely used in modern life—in order to take on challenges never attempted before. Her work analyzes dichotomies in a universally understood manner by translating concepts into tangible objects symbolically. =Feminist themes= Lin's work often deals with themes specific to women and while critics have compared her work to Western feminist art with its focus on the manifestations of domesticity, she has rejected that characterization.1\\\\. Smith, Karen (October 2012). \\"Woven Labors\\" (PDF). Art in America: 138–144. I looked in many books and catalogues about female artists to see if this was true but came to the conclusion that it was not. I had always judged life from my own experience as a person, who just happened to be a woman. Lin is one of the first female Chinese artists to break ground and achieve international recognition from exhibits all over Europe to shows all over the USA and works in galleries everywhere from Australia to Canada. The contrast within the materials Lin uses creates a binary conversation about the human, and female, experience. Every subject Lin addresses in her art, she depicts in a black & white, cold & hot, binary conversation. Lin's work also challenges normative ideas of womanhood, beauty and motherhood. In her 2004 work Boy and Girl, Lin attempts to put forth the idea that modern education is standardized, \\"teaching boys never to cry and girls to be soft\\". The majority of her work encompasses feminist ideologies in order to dismantle societal gender stereotypes. Being Chinese and growing up within Chinese culture, Lin encountered gender-based oppression against women early on in life. Advocating for women artists in an attempt to change the way in which people view feminism is one of her defining traits. =Notable works= Lin is best known for her installations. One of her earliest works, The Proliferation of Thread Winding (1995), included 20,000 balls of thread attached with needles to a rice paper-covered iron bed. In 2012, she made a series of works using a wooden frame, threads and synthetic bones; Minty Blue (2012) and Duckling Yellow (2012) were two works in the series that explored suppression and boundaries using symbolic colors monochromatically to keep the attention on the object. Systems Reaction(2018), the concept originates from the system of the human body and draws from a range of modern critical and political theory, as well as from contemporary psychology.

A wooden settle designed with Zodiac themes, it was made for Burges' rooms at Buckingham Street, and later moved to the drawing room of The Tower House, the home that he designed for himself in Holland Park. Burges desired to fill his home with furniture \\"covered with paintings, both ornaments and subjects; it not only did its duty as furniture, but spoke and told a story.\\" At one stage the poet John Betjeman gave the settle to the novelist Evelyn Waugh, and it is now in the collection of The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum in Bedford. Design The settle is a wooden bench with a canopy. It is painted and stenciled, with inlaid pieces of glass crystal and vellum. In 1865, Burges wrote, \\"it is almost impossible for us to conceive the effect of a first-class piece of medieval sacred furniture covered with burnished gilding engraved and punched into patterns enriched with paintings by an artist like Giotto, and glittering with mosaics of gilt and coloured glass.\\" The only settle that Burges created, its form has been likened to a day bed of the Italian Renaissance. Burges scorned his typical French Gothic influences in his design for the settle, being influenced instead by English Gothic sources as well as the Italian Renaissance. It is decorated with a central painted panel, painted by Henry Stacy Marks. The panel features an enthroned sun, with the Zodiac signs dancing around it. The signs of Leo, Virgo, Cancer, Gemini, Taurus and Aries dance on the right, and Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces are dancing on the left. The planets of the solar system are depicted as musicians on one side of the settle, with Saint Cecilia and another female figure on the other side. It is inscribed in Latin \\"\\" (\\"Burges the Architect had me made in the year of salvation 1869 however he had me painted in April of the year of salvation 1870\\"). The maker of the settle is unknown; it is believed to be either Harland and Fisher, who had made earlier pieces of furniture for Burges, or John Walden, who made the guest bedroom furniture for the Tower House. The settle featured in photographs published in 1885, taken in Buckingham Street by Burges's brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. The settle is shown with an embroidered panel and three seat cushions. History Designed by Burges for himself, the Zodiac settle was originally placed in his rooms at 15 Buckingham Street on The Strand in London, and later moved to The Tower House in Holland Park around 1878, when Burges first occupied the house. The Tower House was designed by Burges by himself. Burges continued to work on Tower House until his death in 1881, and the Zodiac settle was placed opposite the drawing room windows in Tower House. The decoration of the drawing room remained unfinished upon Burges's death. The Tower House was subsequently owned by Burges's brother-in-law, Pullan, and then by Colonel T. H. Minshall in the 1920s. Minshall offered the Zodiac settle and other items from Tower House for sale in 1933, but the settle remained unsold. The Tower House was owned by Colonel E. R. B. Graham and his wife from 1933. The English poet John Betjeman, a champion of the architecture of the Victorian Gothic Revival, later befriended the Grahams and Betjeman was given the remaining two-year lease on the Tower House and some of the furniture upon Mrs Graham's death in 1962. Betjeman subsequently gave the Zodiac settle as well as the \\"Narcissus washstand\\" and the \\"Philosophy cabinet\\" from Tower House to his friend, the novelist Evelyn Waugh. It is believed Betjeman gave them to Waugh to appease his wife, Penelope, who did not share his appreciation of Gothic Revival painted furniture. The \\"Philosophy cabinet\\" is now in the private collection of Andrew Lloyd Webber and the \\"Narcissus washstand\\" in the collection of The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum in Bedford. Waugh mentioned the settle in a letter to his daughter Maragret FitzHerbert in July 1965. Waugh wrote that the settle was \\"looking very well between the windows of the morning-room\\". The settle descended through the Waugh family before being acquired by The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum in 2011. =2011 acquisition= A temporary export bar was placed on the settle by the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest (RCEWA). The RCEWA is part of the Arts Council England and advise the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on matters concerning the exporting of objects of national interest. It was subsequently acquired by The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum in Bedford after a £480,000 grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund (NHMF), £190,000 from the Trustees of the Cecil Higgins Art Gallery and £180,000 from the Art Fund.

It lies near the Oker river in the south of the city. The architect was Carl Christoph Wilhelm Fleischer. The castle was named after the princess's English home in Richmond Park, a royal park now in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.  Architecture  The castle grounds are located along Wolfenbütteler Straße (\\"Wolfenbüttel Street\\") in the city district of Heidberg-Melverode. The building is built in Baroque style, and has a square floor plan with the entrance at one corner. The state rooms are located on the diagonal, and on either side of these, there are private rooms and a mezzanine floor. The facade is divided into pedestal, pilaster, and entablature areas, with a balustrade parapet. Projecting avant-corps and perrons (staircases) emphasize the respective ends of the corps de logis. Compared to the original plan, the designs of the balustrade, staircases, and roof were changed over the course of time. For example, in 1785 the architect Christian Gottlob Langwagen improved the lighting in the central part of the building by installing a roof lantern with 12 windows. In 1935, the city of Braunschweig acquired the castle grounds from Duke Ernst August. Since 1945, the building has been used for public events. The 18th-century paintings in the interior of the building were restored from 1977 to 1981.  Park  The park was created along with the castle in 1768, in the style of a classic English landscape garden. Together with the Wörlitzer Park, it is one of the earliest landscape gardens in northern Germany. The park was designed by the renowned English landscape architect Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown and is similar in structure and details to Richmond Park, a royal park in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. A special feature of the park are the long lines of sight that extend far into the country from the castle. Brown's intention was possibly to create a peaceful, picturesque, ideal representation of a landscape painting. Over the years, the original design was modified and adapted to the tastes of the respective era. From 1830, Duke Wilhelm employed the court gardener Johann Christian Burmester to expand the park significantly. Between 1833 and 1838, more buildings were added – the Ducal Villa and Schloss Neu-Richmond or Williams Castle (which no longer exists). In addition, larger water areas and an island were created. The park has been open to the public since 1964. The nearly four-acre park, largely neglected after the end of the Second World War, was reconstructed in 1987 after the historic original design.  Miscellaneous  The castle is not open every day and can only be visited with a guide. Only the state rooms on the ground floor (the three on the diagonal and two smaller rooms facing the gardens on either side of the diagonal) are accessible to the public, because the first floor is a private residence. In 1871, a Braunschweig brewery was named after the castle's popular name, Feldschlößchen. A travelling brewer from Braunschweig took the name to Switzerland and founded the Feldschlösschen brewery in Rheinfelden in 1876. Since 1982, the Gerstäcker Museum has been housed in the former guard and kitchen house.

Category: Obituaries Life Allen was the son of George Baugh Allen. He was educated at King's College School, Rugby and King's College London. In 1867 he was articled to George Fosbery Lyster, engineer in chief to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, with whom he remained until 1870. He was next employed as resident engineer to the Persian railways of Baron de Reuter and afterwards in supervising the construction of docks at Leith and at Boston, Lincolnshire. Meanwhile, Allen was interested in archaeology; and he spent the rest of his life on it, and particularly on the study of prehistoric antiquities and of pre-Norman art in Great Britain. His earliest contribution was to Archæologia Cambrensis (\\"A description of some cairns on Barry Island\\"), appearing in April 1873; he joined the Cambrian Archaeological Association in 1875, was elected a member of the general committee in 1877, became one of two editors of its Journal in 1889, and was sole editor from 1892 until his death. Having begun with the antiquities of Wales, Allen from 1880 gave attention to those of Scotland also; in 1883 he was elected fellow of the Scottish Society of Antiquaries, and in 1885 was Rhind Lecturer in archaeology in the University of Edinburgh. In England, he became fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1896, editor of the Reliquary and Illustrated Archæologist in 1893; and Yates Lecturer in archæology in University College, London, for 1898. Allen was unmarried, and during his later years made his home in London, where he died on 5 July 1907. Works In addition to contributions to archaeological journals, Allen published: # Theory and Practice in the Designs and Construction of Dock Walls, 1876. # Early Christian Symbolism in Great Britain and Ireland (Rhind Lectures), 1887. # The Monumental History of the Early British Church, 1889. # The Early Christian Monuments of Scotland, Edinburgh, 1903. # Celtic Art in Pagan and Christian Times, 1904.

Saccadic eye movement is primarily controlled by the frontal cortex. Use=Research in pathophysiology= Saccadic eye movements and anti- saccadic eye movements are carried out by similar regions of the brain: the frontal eye field (FEF), the supplementary motor area (SMA), the thalamus and putamen. Anti-saccades require an intention to will the movement and inhibit a reflexive response. It was therefore thought that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex played a greater role in anti-saccadic movements. This theory was disproved by O’Driscoll et al. in a study that used positron emission tomography to analyze brain activity during anti-saccadic movement. The study showed that the DLPFC was equally activated in both saccadic and anti-saccadic movements. Anti-saccades required increased activation of the FEF, SMA and putamen. Currently, the AS task is utilized as a gross assessment of frontal lobe function in neurologic and psychiatric diseases. The task has a high sensitivity, however its specificity is low. Of note, children and adults over the age of 70 will physiologically have an increased rate of error on the anti-saccade task. =Psychological research= Modified versions of the task, often termed as emotional antisaccade task, have been used in psychological and psychophysiological research to investigate the interaction between visual attention and the processing of emotions. Emotion drives attention: people are usually biased to direct eye movements towards emotional rather than neutral and dull stimuli. The emotional version of the antisaccade task uses emotional stimuli (photographs or conditioned stimuli) as visual targets, requiring participants to look in the opposite direction.Kissler, Johanna, and Andreas Keil. \\"Look–don’t look! How emotional pictures affect pro-and anti-saccades.\\" Experimental Brain Research 188.2 (2008): 215-222. Performance in the task is a measure for attentional biases in healthy participants and various disorders such as mood disorders, addiction and social anxiety. Procedure To perform the anti-saccade task, an individual is asked to fixate on a motionless target (such as a small dot). A stimulus is then presented to one side of the target. The individual is asked to make a saccade in the direction away from the stimulus. For example, if a stimulus is presented to the left of the motionless target, the patient should look toward the right. Failure to inhibit a reflexive saccade is considered an error. Neurologic disorders affecting both the frontal cortex or the basal ganglia have shown impaired performance on the anti-saccade task. These include schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Additionally, disseminated brain disease such as Alzheimer's disease or AIDS dementia also have an increased number of errors. History The anti-saccade test was initially described in 1978 by Peter Hallet when he was a faculty member at the Department of Physiology of the University of Toronto. Many other researchers have used this task, including Guitton et al. and Pierrot- Deseilligny et al. In Guitton’s studies, the AS task was administered to patients whose dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was removed therapeutically for intractable epilepsy. This group was compared to healthy controls and patients whose temporal lobes had been removed, also for seizure relief. Results from Guitton’s studies showed that only patients with frontal lobe lesions performed abnormally on the AS task. In contrast, studies by Pierrot- Deseilligny et al. correlated high error rates of AS to specific lesions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). In this study, patients with unilateral infarctions of the posterior parietal lobe were compared against infarctions in 3 frontal regions: the supplementary motor area, frontal eye fields (FEF), and the DLPFC. Only patients with infarctions of the DLPFC showed statistically significant error rates.

Early life and education  Stein Reinertsen was born and grew up in Oslo, with parents originally from Lista in Southern Norway. His father died when he was 14. Reinertsen obtained a cand.theol. degree from the MF Norwegian School of Theology in Oslo in 1986. After finishing practical theological studies, he was consecrated as a pastor of the Church of Norway in the Oslo Cathedral in 1987.  Career  In 1988, Reinertsen worked as a military chaplain in Hans Majestet Kongens Garde (the Royal guards). From 1989 to February 1992, he worked for the Norwegian Christian Student and School Association. Then he worked as a student pastor at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences from 1992 to 1995. In 1995, he was head of Credo Forlag, a publishing house owned by the Norwegian Christian Student and School Association. He served as parish priest in Farsund from 1996 to 2012; between 2010 and 2012 he also worked as a hospital pastor at the Sørlandet Hospital Flekkefjord. In March 2012, he became dean of the Mandal prosti (deanery). Stein Reinertsen was one of five nominated candidates to become bishop after Olav Skjevesland announced his retirement in 2012. After a round of input from various church bodies, Reinertsen remained as a candidate together with Anne- May Grasaas and Ludvig Bjerkreim. In the second round, he obtained the most votes among local parishes and priests. Eight bishops preferred Anne-May Grasaas, while four preferred Reinertsen. The Church's National Council, having the final say, voted ten for Reinertsen and five for Grasaas. His appointment was announced in December 2012. It was the first time after the reformation that a bishop in the Church of Norway was appointed by a body of the church and not by the Norwegian government. This was a result of changes to the Constitution of Norway in 2012. He was consecrated bishop in Kristiansand Cathedral on 27 January 2013. King Harald attended the ceremony, which was the first time he attended a ' without being head of the Church. Minister of Church affairs Rigmor Aasrud also attended the event which was led by bishop Helga Haugland Byfuglien who was the Preses.  Theological profile  Stein Reinertsen is considered a conservative theologian, but refuses the label of theological conservative. Early in his career, he was opposed to ordination of women to priesthood, but he changed his view as a result of further studies of bible texts and conversations with former bishop Odd Bondevik. After he was elected bishop, Aftenposten featured a story about Reinertsen being opposed to marrying people who are divorced. This stance was criticised by politicians and others, with the leader of the Vest-Agder Labour Party Linda Verdal leaving the church in protest. In subsequent interviews, Reinertsen underlined that subordinate priests in the diocese were free to follow their own conscience on the issue and he would not discourage them from marrying divorced persons. In 2013, Reinertsen was among a minority of four bishops who opposed a proposal to allow gay marriages in the Church of Norway, as well as opposing a compromise of allowing church blessing of gay couples who have married secularly. The church's national council has the final say on the issue. He has been engaged in multicultural work to include immigrants in the Church of Norway, and took courses in the topic in 2008 and 2009.  Personal life  Reinertsen is married and has three grown children. As bishop, he lives in an apartment in the centre of Kristiansand which is owned by the Church of Norway.

Martin wrote farming-inspired feature stories and other articles for The New York Times and magazines. Early life and education Martin was born in Shelbyville, Kentucky, on August 11, 1907. She attended elementary school in Chicago and graduated from the Beard School in Orange, New Jersey (now Morristown-Beard School) in 1925. Martin then completed her bachelor's degree at Barnard College in 1929. She planned to study law at Columbia University, but her father's serious illness cut short her graduate school plans. Writing career Martin worked as a features writer for The New York Times and The New York Times Magazine for 12 years (1940–52). She penned articles for The Yale Review, Read Magazine (a children's magazine published by Weekly Reader), and Country Book Magazine.Fible Family Collection1819-1971 (bulk 1881–1956) Martin also wrote articles that ran in IBM's Think magazine and The American Tradition. While writing her articles, Martin ran a farm in Fairfax, Virginia, which she renovated from a previously dilapidated property. Themes from her farming activities and novelists Ellen Glasgow, Edith Wharton, Elizabeth Drexel, and Virginia Woolf influenced Martin's writing. The Kentucky Historical Society, a Kentucky state agency in Frankfort, Kentucky, houses Martin's papers and her uncle Micajah's. (Micajah Fible wrote for The Chicago Tribune). The collection preserves manuscripts for Martin's New York Times articles, her notebooks and diaries, and her application for the Daughters of the American Revolution. (The application contains supporting documents, including copies of wills, an 1819 indenture, and genealogical information.) The collection also includes letters between Micajah Fible and novelist John Fox, Jr. In 1945, Martin penned an article for The New York Times Magazine that shared her observations of prisoners of war (POWs) laboring on a farm. Located near the Fairfax County Courthouse, the farm housed 158 POWs from World War II, including Austrians, Czechs, Germans, and Poles. The POWs worked a 12-hour-day that lasted from 7 am to 7 pm, and they served as dairymen, poultrymen, and general farmers. Describing the historical experiences of POWs in America, the 1976 book The Enemy among Us: World War II Prisoners of War referenced Martin's article. The 1978 book The Faustball Tunnel: German POWs in America and Their Great Escape also references her article. Spring Comes to the Farm Martin's influential narrative \\"Spring Comes to the Farm\\" appeared in three anthologies.

The player leads the princess Ida through mazes of optical illusions and impossible objects while manipulating the world around her to reach various platforms. Monument Valley was developed over ten months beginning in early 2013 based on concept drawings by company artist Ken Wong. Its visual style was inspired by Japanese prints, minimalist sculpture, and indie games Windosill, Fez, and Sword & Sworcery, and was compared by critics to M. C. Escher drawings and Echochrome. The art was designed such that each frame would be worthy of public display. After a closed beta test, it was released for iOS on April 3, 2014, and was later ported to Android and Windows Phone. The game received generally favorable reviews. Critics praised its art and sound design, but noted its lack of difficulty and short length. It won a 2014 Apple Design Award, was named Apple's best iPad game of 2014, and sold over two million copies by January 2015; by May 2016, sales of the game exceeded 26 million. A sequel, Monument Valley 2, was released for both iOS and Android in June and November 2017, respectively.  Gameplay  alt=A white figure stands on a floating structure along with black beaked figures. In Monument Valley, player-character princess Ida journeys through mazes of optical illusions and impossible objects, which are referred to as \\"sacred geometry\\" in-game, as she journeys to be forgiven for something. The game is presented in isometric view, and the player interacts with the environment to find hidden passages as Ida progresses to the map's exit. Each of the ten levels has a different central mechanic. Interactions include moving platforms and pillars, and creating bridges. The player is indirectly cued through the game by design elements like color, and directly cued by crow people, who block Ida's path. Critics compared the game's visual style to a vibrant M. C. Escher drawing and Echochrome. The game includes a camera mode where the player can roam the level to compose screenshots. It includes filters similar to those of Instagram.  Development  Monument Valley was developed by Ustwo, a digital design firm founded in 2004 that has produced iPhone apps since 2007. Their Whale Trail game received millions of downloads, and their other apps include design app Granimator and photo sharing app Rando. Monument Valley was conceived as a touch game for tablets. Its development began in the beginning of 2013, and lasted 10 months. It was developed under the working title, Tower of Illusion. It began with a piece of concept art drawn in the style of M. C. Escher, and the final design did not deviate far from this original. Ustwo management did not give the development team a timeline or budget, and instead told them to focus on \\"making a high-quality product\\". Games development is not a large portion of Ustwo's revenue, so the company focuses its games development on producing \\"great products\\" that reflect well on the company, rather than highly profitable apps. Ken Wong, the lead designer for Ustwo, at the 2015 Game Developers Conference Of the art style, game designer and artist Ken Wong said he aspired to make each frame of the gameplay worthy of public display. The project began as Wong's concept drawings before it became a game project. The visual style was inspired by Japanese prints, minimalist sculpture, and indie games Windosill, Fez, and Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP. Wong added that the gameplay was designed to let the player find the object of the game through exploration, without direct guidance. The game uses colors to signify where the player can interact, similar to Mirror's Edge. Wong compared the gameplay experience to a cross between the wonder of a toy shop and the world of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, and its story to a symbolic \\"song\\" rather than a narrative book. The game was designed to be completed by most players, a style uncommon for games designed for popular audiences. It was intended to be a \\"premium experience\\" rather than a difficult challenge. The game was in beta as of December 2013, where it had over 1,000 testers and the average finish time was 90 minutes. It was planned as an iPad exclusive. The game was initially released for iOS on April 3, 2014, and the company recouped their cost of development within the first two weeks of release. An Android port went through two beta tests and was later released on May 14, 2014. More levels were in development, as of April 2014. Ustwo said they were adding the levels for \\"artistic reasons\\", such as ideas they wanted to try but could not fit into the original release. Wong stated that, with consumer interest, the company would consider porting the game to other platforms. The game's technical director said that the game was \\"not very difficult to port\\" since it was written in the Unity game engine. But as the game was built with a portrait (vertical) screen orientation in mind, the developer had difficulty converting the game for devices with landscape- oriented (horizontal) screens, such as the YouTube trailer video format and the PlayStation Vita. An add-on expansion, entitled Forgotten Shores, was released for iOS devices on November 12, 2014, on the Appstore on November 20, 2014 and on Google Play Store on November 24, 2014. This adds eight additional levels to the ten in the original game. An expansion pack titled Ida's (RED) Dream was available for purchase for a limited time as part of Apple's Apps for Red initiative. This expansion pack could be played with or without the additional purchase of Forgotten Shores, featuring Ida in a red outfit and several new puzzles. A Windows Phone port was released on April 30, 2015. The game's soundtrack features music by Stafford Bawler, Obfusc, and Grigori. A limited edition vinyl two-volume recording is set to be released by Ustwo and iam8bit sometime in the second quarter of 2016, and will include the music from the main game and its two expansions.  Reception  The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. It immediately went to the top of the App Store paid apps chart, where it stayed for at least a month based on strong reviews and word of mouth. It was chosen as an App Store Editor's Choice and later both received a 2014 Apple Design Award and was named Apple's best iPad game of 2014. Pocket Gamer gave the game their gold award, and their Harry Slater wrote that there was \\"nothing else like Monument Valley on the App Store\\". Multiple reviewers cited the art and sound design as exceptional. Edge added that the sound design's addition of \\"deep rumbles\\" and environmental \\"clicks\\" gave the game the feeling of Tomb Raider moving \\"ancient mechanisms\\". TouchArcade Shaun Musgrave called the visuals \\"almost impossibly gorgeous\\", and Wired wrote that the game \\"might be the most beautiful iPad game of 2014\\". Creative Review called the game's puzzles \\"clever\\" and appreciated the developers' attention to detail. While Polygon Danielle Riendeau praised the puzzle design, other critics noted its lack of difficulty and short length. Riendeau wrote that the puzzles solutions always felt intuitive and never felt frustrating. She found \\"everything\\" about the game to be \\"soothing, almost hypnotic\\". Edge thought that the game did not present a \\"genuine\\" challenge, and that the puzzles did not \\"find fresh ways to confound and delight\\" until the final levels. The magazine compared the game to \\"assembling flat-pack furniture\\": straightforward in its process, but rewarding in its transformation. Harry Slater of Pocket Gamer wrote that the game was \\"almost breathtakingly unique\\". Riendeau said she finished the game in under three hours, and TouchArcade Shaun Musgrave, who could not \\"even begin to imagine anyone getting stuck on ... the puzzles\\", put the game's length at \\"an hour and change\\". Jeff Marchiafava of Game Informer wanted more content. He was also unsatisfied with the game's narrative, which he found \\"obtuse\\" and \\"vague\\" to a fault. Musgrave of TouchArcade thought that while games that focus on experiences can be shorter, Monument Valley did not last long enough \\"for the mechanics to reach their full potential\\", though the time was \\"just about right\\" for the story. Monument Valley sold 500,000 copies in a month, and one million copies in three months. In November 2014, the game had sold 1.4 million copies and by January 2015, the game had sold 2.4 million copies. In January 2015, Ustwo noted that the game had seen a large amount of software piracy, with 95% of the installs on Android and 60% on iOS devices coming from unpaid copies; the company asserted some of these may include users installing on multiple devices but believe the majority was though users that had not purchased the title. While these numbers were discouraging, the company asserted it will continue to develop premium titles for mobile devices. Despite the piracy, Ustwo stated they have exceeded $6 million in revenue from sales of the game as of mid-January 2015, exceeding the $1.4 million in development costs. By January 2016, USTwo reported that more than 24 million users have downloaded the game, the ten-fold increase from 2015 partially due to legitimate giveaways of the game through Apple's App Store, Google Play, and Amazon Underground. Of about seven million of the free downloads through Apple, about 35% of them purchased the \\"Forgotten Shores\\" expansion. Ustwo reported total sales over $14 million from 26 million copies by May 2016. The game was named as a finalist for Innovation Award, Best Visual Art, and Best Handhold/Mobile Game for the 2015 Game Developers Choice Awards, and was an honorable mention for Best Design. The game was also named a finalist for Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction, Outstanding Achievement in Game Direction, Outstanding Innovation in Gaming, Mobile Game of the Year, and the D.I.C.E. Spirit Award for the 18th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. The title won the BAFTA Video Game Awards for best \\"British Game\\" and \\"Mobile/Handheld Game\\", while nominated for \\"Best Game\\", \\"Artistic Achievement\\", and \\"Original Property\\" awards. At the 2014 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR) awards Monument Valley won the category Game, Special Class and was nominated for Game Design, New IP and Art Direction, Fantasy. Time magazine placed the game on their best of list while being Game Informers \\"Editor's Choice\\" for \\"Best Mobile Exclusive\\".  Legacy  The game was a \\"minor plot point\\" in the third season of House of Cards, in which Frank Underwood plays the game; he is inspired by video gamer reviewer Thomas Yates's elegant description of Monument Valley to bring the reviewer on as his biographer. According to the studio Ustwo, they were approached by Netflix about including the game in the story, and the studio readily agreed without any financial compensation. They made a specialized version of the game for the show to aid in filming and to meet a description of the game provided within the script for the first episode in which it appeared. Ustwo saw the opportunity to introduce the title to a different audience set, and have already seen an increase in sales as a result of this appearance. The game re-entered the top of the most download app charts on the major app stores a few days after the February 2015 release of the season on Netflix. Monument Valley characters were added to the cast of Crossy Road in late 2015. Jaz Rignall (USgamer) noted that the 2015 Lara Croft Go appeared to have been influenced by Monument Valley. Ken Wong left Ustwo Games soon after completing Monument Valley to create his own studio, Mountains, which created Florence. Monument Valley was reported to have a significant influence on China's indie game development community, as its ability to tell an emotional story through a video game medium influenced numerous developers to build out their own games with similar narratives. Ustwo developed a sequel Monument Valley 2, which was first released for iOS on June 5, 2017 and for Android on November 6, 2017.  Film adaptation  In August 2018, Paramount Animation and Weed Road, in partnership with Ustwo, announced plans to develop a live action/CGI hybrid film based on Monument Valley, with Patrick Osborne slated to direct. It is anticipated that the film will feature live actors exploring the computer generated settings based on the game. Osborne stated \\"I’m privileged to be handed the reins to Ida’s mysterious kingdom, to play in her world of impossible architecture where seeing things differently is everything\\".

The film begins with a description of police violence in the 1997 Ramabai killings. It goes on to explore various aspects of the lives and politics of Dalit people in Mumbai. The film took 14 years to produce, and was released in 2011 after the conclusion of the court trials that followed the Ramabai incident. The film was widely shown both nationally and internationally, and received an overwhelmingly positive reaction. It has won numerous national and international awards. Synopsis=Ramabai colony killings= Jai Bhim Comrade begins with a description of the Indian caste system and its oppression of the Dalit community. The film includes a song by Dalit poet and activist Vilas Ghogre, followed by a shot of a newspaper clipping describing his suicide in reaction to the Ramabai killings in 1997. The documentary then describes the killings; on 11 July 1997 a statue of B. R. Ambedkar in the Dalit colony of Ramabai had a garland of footwear placed over it, an act considered to be a desecration. An initially peaceful protest was fired upon by a team of Special Reserve Police Force members, killing ten protesters, and other protests later in the day saw further police violence. Commentators stated that the violence was motivated by caste-based prejudices, as the leader of the police team stood accused of several cases of mistreatment of Dalit people. The Dalit singer, poet, and activist Vilas Ghogre hanged himself in protest at the incident. After narrating the incidents surrounding the killing, the documentary follows Patwardhan on his visits to the families of those killed in the firing, as well as to Ghogre's wife. The film tries to reconstruct the incident by interviewing witnesses on both sides. The footage shot by a civilian bystander is used to contradict the description of the incident given by the police. The film then shows interviews with many of Ghoghre's colleagues, who discuss the state of Dalit politics in India. In a voice-over, Patwardhan describes the life of Ambedkar, and his activism against the caste system. The interviews are interspersed with other Dalits describing difficulties and discrimination they face in their lives. This section of the documentary also explores the relationship between the Dalit activist movement. The film describes the complicity of the Shiv Sena in the Ramabai killings, and shows Bal Thackeray at a public rally stating that Muslims need to be exterminated. The film then contrasts the Shiv Sena's attempts to portray itself as the champion of the Dalit cause, with the speeches and songs of the Dalit leaders attempting to counteract this. =Kabir Kala Manch= The second part of the film focuses on contemporary Dalit activism, chiefly the activities of the Kabir Kala Manch, a troupe of singers using their performances to raise awareness and support for their cause. Many clips of songs and protests are shown, together with interviews with the leaders of the troupe. The film describes the initial successes of the troupe during the protests that followed the Khairlanji massacre in 2006. The ideology of the group was a mixture of that of Ambedkar fused with left- wing ideology. However, the group was soon branded a Naxalite outfit, and led to it being targeted by the Anti-terrorist squad. Several members were forced to go on the run, while others were arrested. The film ends with interviews with the mothers of two of the members of Kabir Kala Manch that had been forced to go underground. Production Jai Bhim Comrade was filmed over a period of 14 years, from 1997 to its release in 2011. Part of the reason it took that length of time was that Patwardhan wanted to wait for the outcome of the trials that followed the Ramabai incident before finishing the documentary. The documentary also uses a significant amount of archival footage from Patwardhan's previous documentary Bombay Our City, released in 1985. Music is featured heavily, almost as much as spoken words. Patwardhan stated that one of the reasons for the film's 200 minute length was that he felt like he could not cut any of the footage while editing it, as it all contributed to the atmosphere of the film. Reception and analysis In a review of the film, Human Rights Watch criticised its style, saying that the use of music got repetitive, and that the length of the film made it inaccessible. However, the review stated that the content was \\"astoundingly important,\\" and that \\"Jai Bhim Comrade is an incredibly important work that brings to attention a broad culture of atrocious oppression, dismantling entirely any argument that caste-discrimination is a thing of the past.\\" A review in Outlook magazine suggested that an important aspect of the film was the exploration of the tension between the Ambedkarite Dalit activist movement, and the mainstream left-wing movement exemplified in the various communist outfits. The Dalit activists shown in the film, such as the Kabir Kala Manch, represented the true intersection of Dalit and left-wing activism. The review also commented that some Dalit activists had begun to associate with the Shiv Sena despite its leader Bal Thackeray making hate-speeches against Muslims, and contrasted them with the Kabir Kala Manch, which was the \\"new hope on the horizon.\\" The scholar Balmurli Natarajan, writing in the journal Economic and Political Weekly, stated that the film spoke to the need for solidarity between the Dalit movement and the leftist movement, and that the unpunctuated title of the film spoke to this. A review in The Guardian said that the film \\"exposed the glaring realities...about the continuing oppression of the poorer castes,\\" and that it could be seen as \\"a capstone to Patwardhan's extraordinary career.\\" The anthropologist Deborah Matzner said that the film contrasted the \\"thetrical Hindutva\\" of the Shiv Sena with the \\"poignant and defiant\\" political music of the Kabir Kala Manch, and said that \\"blatant and appalling hate speech [of Bal Thackeray] serves as the dark corollary to Dalit leaders’ skillful, rousing oratory and song.\\" A review in the film magazine Jump Cut stated that \\"This film explores and valorizes one of the best examples of cultural and political struggle today.\\" Film critic Mark Cousins wrote that the film \\"is about the Dalit people like Dickens is about London. It’s a Marxist musical that bubbles like a stream and then – over its 3 hour running time –opens and deepens like a river.\\" He called Patwardhan \\"the greatest Asian documentarist\\" and bemoaned the fact that \\"[m]ost [...] major film festivals in the West\\" rejected the film, writing that they \\"often show docs about small parts of Western life, yet [...] couldn't find space for this polygeneric film of much greater amplitude that covers decades, generations, great iniquity and the historical picaresque.\\" He goes on to suggest the film's complexity and many Westerners' unfamiliarity with the subject matter as possible reasons for it being ignored. British- Ghanaian writer and filmmaker Kodwo Eshun voted for the film on Sight & Sound's poll of \\"The Greatest Documentaries of All Time\\", as did two other critics (Julia Lesage and Cheuk To-Li).

She is known for her paintings, sculptures, performances, and collages, most of which are inspired by remembrance and nostalgia. She studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (1996), Fine Arts Academy in Gdańsk (2000), and the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam.  Early life and education  Olowska was born in 1976 in Gdańsk, Poland. Olowska's father was a speechwriter for the Solidarity movement and its leader, Lech Walesa. He later moved to the United States as a political refugee. The rest of his family joined him by 1985. Before Paulina left for the United States, a classmate told her to visit the American restaurant that had playgrounds and served little chickens served to children. The restaurant turned out to be McDonald's and it was Olowska's introduction to how marketing could create certain feelings based on the aesthetic choices made by companies, such as the shiny colors of McDonald's, the marketing of Rainbow Brite, Jem, and the Cabbage Patch Kids, and the “fluffy tops of hamburgers.\\" After just a year in the United States, Olowska's parents divorced. She subsequently moved back to Poland where she came to adolescence amid a swell of underground culture in the early 1990s. This eventually led her to attend art school, first at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and later at the Fine Arts Academy in Gdańsk.  Work  Paulina Ołowska, Constructivist Rockabilly Boots (Buty Konstruktywistyczne typu Rockabilly), 2000 Olowska works with a range of media, including painting, sculpture, and collage. Often, her works incorporate pop art, graffiti, and Soviet propaganda. For instance, her sculpture works reference 1930s country-style villas that resemble haunted houses. In addition, some of her larger paintings make reference to women's fashion from the 1980s as well as the non-urban setting of her home and studio in Poland. \\"I describe sometimes what I do as working with the leftovers or dusty aesthetics. They don’t need to be dusty because they’re old, but they’re kind of not really in the center. So minor kinds of aesthetics, and I try to renegotiate them on the platform of art.” Her works have been exhibited at the 50th Venice Biennale (2003), the Stedelijk Museum's 2004 exhibit, Time and Again, the 9th Istanbul Biennial (2005) and the 5th Berlin Biennale (2008). In 2010 she had a solo show at the Glasgow Tramway and another in 2011 at the New York Museum of Modern Art. In 2013 she collaborated with Mick la Rock to create the backdrop for her exhibit, Au Bonheur des Dames at the Stedelijk. Olowska produced a live production of Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz's (Witkacy) The Mother at the Tate Modern Realist Gallery in 2015. Her latests body of work, Wisteria, Mysteria, Hysteria, will coincide with a performance piece at The Kitchen in January 2016, in which she will paint the set and design costumes for “a form of ballet” in collaboration with composer Sergei Tcherepnin and choreographer Katy Pyle, the artistic director of Ballez.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Western Massachusetts. In 1974 the cathedral was included as a contributing property in the Quadrangle–Mattoon Street Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Christ Church Cathedral in the early 20th century Christ Church began on May 13, 1817, in the chapel of the Springfield Armory under the guidance of the armory's superintendent Colonel Roswell Lee. A fire at the main armory buildings on March 2, 1824, forced the church out, as the space was needed by the armory for other purposes. Services were held at various Springfield locations, including the Methodist church, the parish house of the First Church (Congregationalist), and the old court house. The Rev'd Henry Washington Lee, the son of Col. Lee, took charge of the congregation on October 28, 1838 and it was reorganized. Henry Lee went on to become the first Episcopal Bishop of Iowa in 1854. Property at the corner of State and Dwight Streets was acquired in 1839 and a new church was built there. Among the names of those parishioners contributing to the building of the new parish church were Anna McNeill Whistler, wife of George Washington Whistler and mother of James Abbott McNeill Whistler, the famous painter. The Whistler family rented Pew No. 9. The new church was a rectangular building with a square turreted cupola. The building was enlarged in 1851 after then rector, Abram Newkirk Littlejohn recognized the need to expand. In addition to more seating, the project added a chancel, vestry room and library. During the same time, a two-manual tracker-action organ (1833) by E and G.G. Hook was purchased from St. John's Church in Providence, RI, by the Ladies' Society for $687.50, with a promise for more. The Rev'd Littlejohn went on to become the first Bishop of Long Island, and in 1895, officiated at the wedding of Consuelo Vanderbilt and the 9th Duke of Marlborough at St. Thomas Church, New York City. The parish continued to grow and by the 1870s when it was determined a larger church was needed, and the present church was built at a new site on Chestnut Street that was acquired in 1874. Construction began the same year and the first service was held on May 21, 1876. A new Processional Cross and Office Lights (all still in use today) were designed by the famous Henry Vaughan as early works by the now famous architect of the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., and produced by the famous Gorham company. The tower of the new church cracked early on and had to be removed. It was rebuilt in 1927. The first convention of the Diocese of Western Massachusetts met at Christ Church on November 19, 1901. On February 7, 1929, Christ Church became the diocesan Cathedral. The Very Rev'd Dr. John M. McGann, who had been rector up to that point, became the first Cathedral Dean.

The glass is refilled with fresh water daily while water from previous day is poured out. It is common to make up the bed for the departed during the 40-day period, donating the bedding to poor on the 40th Day. A towel for the departed is hung next to the window and brought to the church on the 40th Day.

Lenin had proposed a competition to produce a manual for the Scientific Organization of Labour following Platon Kerzhentsev publication of SOL. Kerzhentsev had outlined a three-fold approach: # A subjective approach looking at the worker with a view to maximising their efficiency # An objective approach focusing on the materials and tools used in the labour process # An integrative approach looking at how the first two approaches interrelate in a rational method of work organisation. This conference was noted for a number of innovations: * input-output analysis * ergology a fore-runner of ergonomics Contributions * Vladimir Bekhterev was critical of Taylorism arguing that \\"The ultimate ideal of the labour problem is not in it, but is in such organisation of the labour process that would yield a maximum of efficiency coupled with a minimum of health hazards, absence of fatigue and a guarantee of the sound health and all round personal development of the working people.\\" * Alexander Bogdanov has been credited with first posing the input-output model at this conference. His The Organizational Principles of a Uniform Economic Plan describes how the outputs of one enterprise are the inputs to another enterprise, he pointed out that this then creates chains of production which are only as strong as their weakest link. A shortage in any one input will create a limit for the whole chain. Kerzhentsev was to criticise this in an article in Pravda in 1923. * Vladimir Nikolayevich Myasishchev rejected Frederick Taylor's proposal to turn man into a machine.

It is southeast of the Geisenfeld town center, and extends in a northwest-southeast direction. Munich is south of the village. The former municipality and present village of Rottenegg includes the hamlets of Hornlohe, Moosmühle and Brunn. History From 1169 to 1279 the family of the Counts of Rotteneck were resident at this location, originally called Schermbach. They were descendants of the Lord of Abensberg.Adam Rottler Pfr. i.R. , Abensberg im Wandel der Zeiten, Seite 353, Eigenverlag, Abensberg 1972Wilhelm Ritzinger, Verhandlungen des Historischen Vereins Niederbayern, Band 48, Seite 65, Hrsg 1912 In 1220 Count Meinhard von Rotteneck, a grandson of Gebhard I von Abensberg, built a castle in Mainburg (about to the east), the basis for that town. On 21 August 1279 the last male descendant of the family, Heinrich II von Rotteneck, the Bishop Count of Regensburg, sold Rottenegg castle and its possessions including the Mainburg castle to Duke Ludwig II of Bavaria so he could build his cathedral.Hubert Freilinger, Historischer Atlas von Bayern, Heft 46, S.243, 274 Hrsg.

Life Much is known about Fletcher's three years of voyaging around the world with Drake, but there is little certain information about the rest of his life.David B. Quinn, Explorers and Colonies: America, 1500–1625 (Continuum, 1990), p. 194 John Venn identified Fletcher with a man of this name who entered Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1574, but did not take a degree.John Venn, John Archibald Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses: A Biographical List of All Known Students, Graduates and Holders of Office at the University of Cambridge, from the Earliest Times to 1900, vol. 2 (1922) He was briefly Rector of St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, a parish of the City of London, resigning in July 1576 to join Drake in his preparation of a fleet for purposes which are still disputed.George Hennessy, Novam repertorium ecclesiasticum Londonense (London, 1898), p. 268 He acted as Drake's chaplain during the three-year voyage which ensued, keeping a journal of their adventures which he handed to Drake on the expedition's return to England in 1580. In September 1578, Drake's own ship, the Golden Hind, passed the Strait of Magellan amid storms, and Fletcher recorded that the ship was driven to the \\"utmost island of Terra Incognita\\".William Edmundson, A History of the British Presence in Chile (2009), p. 11 He made a map of \\"Elizabeth Iland\\" (pictured),British Library, Sir Francis Drake: an exhibition to commemorate Francis Drake's Voyage around the World, 1577–1580 (London, 1977), p. 68 which Fletcher and Drake claimed for England, naming it Elizabeth Island.Henry Raup Wagner, Sir Francis Drake's Voyage Around the World (1926), p. 92: \\"Fletcher's act of taking possession\\". Fletcher was sometimes at odds with Drake. In a sermon he preached to the expedition in January 1580, Fletcher suggested that their ships' recent woes had resulted from the unjust death of Thomas Doughty, whom Drake had ordered to be beheaded on 2 July 1578. After the sermon, Drake had Fletcher chained to a hatch cover,Peter Whitfield, Sir Francis Drake (2004), p. 7 then \\"solemnly excommunicated him\\".Walter Oakeshott, Founded Upon the Seas: A Narrative of Some English Maritime and Overseas Enterprises during the Period 1550–1616 (1942, new edition 2010), p. 83 Venn states that Fletcher was Rector of Bradenham in Buckinghamshire from 1579 to 1592, but a later writer, David B. Quinn, points out that Fletcher was still overseas in 1579 and believes Venn has confused him with a man named Richard Fletcher. In 1593 Fletcher became Vicar of Tickhill, Yorkshire, and in 1605 he married Margaret Gallard, a widow. He may have died in 1619, when another man was appointed to his church benefice. Fletcher's log of Drake's voyage formed the basis of The World Encompassed by Sir Francis Drake, an account of the voyage published in London in 1628 at the instigation of Drake's nephew, another Francis Drake.The World Encompassed by Sir Francis Drake... carefully collected out of the Notes of Master Francis Fletcher (London, Nicholas Bourne, 1628) A copy of the first part of Fletcher's journal was made by a man named John Conyers, described as \\"Citizen and Apothecary of London\\", about 1677, and this survives in the British Library, catalogued as \\"Sloane MS 61, Francis Fletcher's Log\\".

The primary purpose of nurse licensure is to grant permission to practice as a nurse after verifying the applicant has met minimal competencies to safely perform nursing activities within nursing's scope of practice. Licensure is necessary when the regulated activities are complex, require specialized knowledge and skill and independent decision making. Nurse licensure also provides: *Nursing activities may only be legally performed by individuals holding a nursing license issued by the regulatory body *Title protection: only the persons issued a license are legally permitted to use certain titles, such as registered nurse, advanced practice registered nurse, etc. *In order to assure that the public is protected, authority is granted to the regulatory body to take disciplinary action in the event the licensee violate the law or any rules promulgated by the regulatory body Nurse licensure also establishes a registry of licensed nurses, hence the term \\"Registered Nurse\\". The first nurse licensure and registration program was initiated in 1901 in New Zealand when the Nurses Registration Act 1901 was enacted into law. The first licensure laws in the United States came in 1903. In the US, applicants must successfully pass the NCLEX exam prior to being granted a license.

It was built around 500 BC and was for some time incorrectly thought to have been dedicated to Ceres,\\"The temple of Athena\\" but as a result of the recovery of numerous statuettes in terracotta depicting Athena, it is now thought to have been dedicated to her. Built on an artificial relief of the ground, it has a high pediment on the façade and a Doric frieze, adorned with metopes encased in sandstone, on slightly slender Doric columns. The structure is simpler than the two temples of Hera nearby, the first Temple of Hera, which is much larger than it, and the Second Temple of Hera. The interior of the wide pronaos contained six columns in the Ionic style (four frontal and two on each side), of which the bases and two capitals remain. These capitals burst from an ornate collar. This seems to be the first example of two architectural orders, Doric and Ionic, co-existing in a single building.Bianchi Bandinelli, 1986 Almost nothing remains of the deep cella destined to house the statue of the goddess. In late antiquity, around the eighth century, the structure was used as a church: the sanctuary was closed with walls between the columns, the walls of the cella were torn down, and the ambulatory in the south was used for burials. These structures were eliminated during the excavation campaigns of the 1940s.

Klein was Commissioner of the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) from May 16, 2011 to December, 2013. He was appointed to this position by Mayor Rahm Emanuel when he took office on May 16, 2011. Klein was also the Director of the District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT) from the end of 2008 until the end of Mayor Adrian Fenty's term, December 31, 2010. Prior, Klein was an Executive with Boston-based Zipcar. He recently authored a book titled Start-Up City: Inspiring Private and Public Entrepreneurship, Getting Projects Done, and Having Fun published by Island Press Early years Gabe Klein was born in Hartford, Connecticut. Before high school he spent ages 10–11 studying under Swami Satchidananda at the Yogaville Vidyalayam interfaith school in Buckingham County, Virginia. He graduated from Virginia Tech in 1994 and holds a degree in marketing management. Private sector career Gabe Klein's career began working as Director of Stores for Bikes USA. Bikes USA was the nation's largest bike retailer in the 1990s. Klein had Director-level roles at ProfessionaLink, a national technology- consulting start-up based in Washington D.C. where he led marketing and business development efforts for Fortune 1000 Companies. At the end of 2002, Klein became regional Vice President for Zipcar, overseeing the car sharing system in the D.C. region (2002–2006). Klein was hired by Founder Robin Chase at the end of 2002 to spearhead growth in the nascent startup which had less than 30 cars in Washington D.C. and no more than 150 nationally. He convinced the D.C. government to give Zipcar on-street parking for their cars, significantly increasing the company's profile. Klein and his team worked on models for fleet management, operations, and marketing, helping the start-up gain its footing to scale nationally and eventually internationally. In 2006, Gabe left Zipcar and wrote 2 business plans. The first for point-to point carsharing based on the emergence of the smartphone and the forthcoming launch of the Smart (automobile) in the United States by Roger Penske's United Auto Group. Klein pursued the project, internally named \\"Virgin-Go\\" for over a year with Richard Branson's Virgin Group going so far as to gain a release from his non-compete with Zipcar. Due to changing priorities and personnel at Virgin USA and a hold on all new investments post-launch of the Virgin America airline, the project was shelved by Virgin. Late in 2007, Daimler launched an identical pilot service utilizing Smart Cars, a smart-phone application, and named \\"Car2Go\\" displacing the Virgin brand. Concurrently, Klein worked on a second business model with 2 business partners and input from the Government of the District of Columbia. The plan was for a mobile food truck concept after Klein was inspired by Howard Schultz's book, \\"Pour Your Heart Into It,\\" about the rise of Starbucks and after seeing the mobile Mud Truck on the streets of New York City. The company he co-founded, \\"On The Fly,\\" was an electric vehicle vending company and the food trucks themselves were branded \\"SmartKarts.\\" On the Fly was one of the first multi-unit and multi-channel food truck companies in the U.S. with brick and mortar stores and mobile catering operations added in 2008. On The Fly custom built electric SmartKarts were able to work on the street, or sidewalk, serving local, fresh, natural foods to the DC area. Ironically, the new business model was stymied by bureaucracies within the District Government. Gabe turned the company over to his partners when Mayor Adrian Fenty asked him to lead the District of Columbia Department of Transportation which was one of the agencies that kept On The Fly from flourishing by disallowing free-flowing access to the curbside. Gabe Klein served 12 years in the private sector before moving to the public sector. Currently Klein is a Special Venture Partner at Fontinalis Partners in Detroit Fontinalis is a venture capital firm focused on the intersection of mobility and technology and was co-founded by Ford Motor Company Chairman and former CEO, Bill Ford Public sector career=Washington, D.C.= Gabe was unanimously elected as Director of the District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT), appointed by Mayor Adrian M. Fenty in December, 2008 and serving until the end of Fenty's term on December 31, 2010. Klein immediately solicited feedback from a variety of stakeholders and advocates to determine how to reinvent the government agency as a customer-focused operation. After months of work, Klein and the DDOT team released their first \\"Action Agenda\\" modeled on the New York City Sustainable Streets plan released the previous year. Eschewing the typical long-term planning, Klein and team prioritized 2-year actionable metrics to mirror the political realities of government combined with the pace of start-up culture that was his operating norm.

The house is atop a promontory where Depot Valley joins the South Branch Potomac River valley. The Valley View property was part of the South Branch Survey of the Northern Neck Proprietary, a large tract that was inherited by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, in 1719. It was settled by John Collins and his family in 1749, and acquired by the Parsons family before 1772. The Valley View house was built by James Parsons Jr. in 1855. After the Civil War, Parsons' widow sold the farm to Charles Harmison. His wife, Elizabeth Harmison, inspired by her childhood Virginia home, Western View, and the scenic South Branch Potomac River views, named the farm Valley View. The most recent of a series of owners, the Mayhew family, bought the property in 1979. Valley View's current proprietors, Robert and Kim Mayhew, have restored the historic residence and grounds. The house at Valley View is a two-story brick structure with a rectangular architectural plan. The front entrance is covered by a small portico, topped with a pediment supported by wooden Doric columns. The rear of the house, with a two-story wood porch stretching across it, faces the South Branch Potomac River valley and Mill Creek Mountain. Each of the original eight large rooms of the 1855 structure contains a fireplace framed by a wooden mantelpiece with classical elements. The original windows, wooden trim, and materials in the main section of the house are intact. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012 as a locally significant example of Greek Revival architecture.  Geography and setting  Mill Creek Mountain, seen from the South Branch Potomac River south of Valley View Island The Valley View house is about northwest of downtown Romney, atop a promontory (known locally as the Yellow Banks) where Depot Valley joins the South Branch Potomac River valley. Depot Valley runs from West Sioux Lane in Romney to Valley View, and an unnamed tributary of Big Run flows north along its bottom. Depot Valley Road parallels the stream. Depot Valley is named for Romney Depot, located at the end of a former spur of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) South Branch line near the intersection of present-day West Sioux Lane and Depot Valley Road. The unincorporated area around the depot was once known as Valley. A post office operated there from 1928 until 1937, when its mail was routed through Romney; it is assumed that Valley View farm used it, since it was south of the house. The Valley View farm property adjoins the Wappocomo farm on the northeast, the corporate limits of Romney on the east and south and the Yellow Banks on the west. As well as Valley View's tract, the Mayhew family owns agricultural land rich in alluvial soils along the South Branch Potomac River west of the house. The South Branch Valley Railroad bisects this farmland, crossing the South Branch Potomac River via a wooden trestle. Valley View Island, an island in the South Branch Potomac River just north of the mouth of Sulphur Spring Run, is approximately southwest of the Valley View house. Both the house and the island are owned by the Mayhew family. The island is ringed by forests, with agricultural fields in its center. When Lots Number17 and19 of the Northern Neck Proprietary South Branch Survey were surveyed in 1749 and resurveyed in 1788, the island belonged to Lot Number19. At that time, the river flowed east of the island, along the base of the Yellow Banks; its course later changed to run around the west side of the island. Mill Creek Mountain, a narrow anticlinal mountain ridge, rises westward from the South Branch Potomac River across from Valley View. The western foothills of South Branch Mountain rise to the east. Both mountains are covered with Appalachian – Blue Ridge forests of hardwoods and pine.  History = Royal land grant and Collins family ownership = The land upon which Valley View is located was originally part of the Northern Neck Proprietary, a land grant that the exiled Charles II awarded to seven of his supporters in 1649 during the English Interregnum. Following the Restoration of Charles II to the throne in 1660, he renewed the Northern Neck Proprietary grant in 1662, revised it in 1669, and again renewed the original grant favoring the original grantees Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper and Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington in 1672. In 1681, Bennet sold his share to Lord Colepeper, and Lord Colepeper received a new charter for the entire land grant from James II in 1688. Following the deaths of Lord Colepeper, his wife Margaret, and his daughter Katherine, the Northern Neck Proprietary passed to Katherine's son Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron in 1719, who selected a portion of it for his manor. This tract, known as the South Branch Survey of the proprietary, extended from the north end of the Trough to the junction of the North and South Branches of the Potomac River. In 1748, Fairfax commissioned James Genn to survey the South Branch Potomac River lowlands for sale and lease, with lots ranging in size from . In 1749, the tract on which Valley View stands was purchased from Lord Fairfax by John Collins. The lot was Lot Number20 on the South Branch Survey. Collins also owned a large tract of land spanning present-day Hampshire and Hardy counties. His son Thomas Collins is thought to have inherited his father's landholdings as an \\"heir at law\\", since there is no record of a will by John Collins dispensing of his properties. By 1772, Thomas Collins acquired Lot Number20, where he lived with his wife Elizabeth. In 1816, Collins was serving as a magistrate when the town of Romney held a Virginia state election for the Electoral College. One representative from each of Virginia's 25 counties traveled to Romney to cast his vote. Collins and county commissioner William Donaldson certified the convention's election results. In 1817, Thomas Collins sold Lot Number20 to James Gregg Parsons. It is unknown whether the Collinses moved from the tract or continued living on it after the sale. Thomas Collins died in 1822, and Elizabeth Collins in 1823. = Parsons family = Wappocomo The Parsons family members were among the first English settlers in the Thirteen Colonies in 1635; around 1740, they settled in Hampshire County. By 1778, Isaac Parsons (1752–1796), a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, owned of Lot Number16 and all of Lot Number17 in the Proprietary. James Gregg Parsons, his eldest son, was born in Hampshire County in 1773. In 1795, he married Mary Catherine Casey (1773–1846), whose family owned the adjoining Lot Number 21. After their marriage, they lived in the main house at Wappocomo, which had been built by Mary Catherine's father Nicholas Casey. The couple inherited the house after Nicholas Casey's death in 1833. James Gregg Parsons died on January 25, 1847, leaving most of his land to his three sons: James (Big Jim) Parsons Jr. (1798–1858), David C. Parsons (1803–1860), and Isaac Parsons (1814–1862). James, his eldest son, inherited Lot Number20 (known as the Collins Tract); his second son David inherited Lot Number13 south of Romney (on which Hickory Grove was later located); and his youngest son Isaac inherited Lot Number21 (which included Wappocomo). His sons also inherited the nearby \\"Jake Sugar Rum Tract, the McGuire Tract, and five town lots in Romney\\". According to historian William K. Rice, by 1846 Parsons' sons and their families were all living on the tracts they would eventually inherit. Rice determined that James Parsons Jr. moved to the Collins Tract, around 1826, and was living there when his father died. James Parsons Jr. was a farmer and cattleman who was born in Hampshire County. Parsons family genealogist Virginia Parsons MacCabe wrote the following description of James Parsons Jr. in her book Parsons' Family History and Record (1913): \\"He was square and honorable in business, and had a large circle of friends; he had the urbanity and the gentility of manner which characterizes the true gentleman\\". Parsons married Elizabeth Miller on January 8, 1829. The couple had eleven children, several of whom attended college. In 1855, Parsons began building the present-day Valley View house on the Collins Tract. Although he wrote many letters to his sister Mary Gregg Parsons Stump about farming, cattle, family, health and community events, no letters are known to remain from the time of the house's construction. The Parsons family owned several slaves who are thought to have assisted with construction. After living in his new house for three years, Big Jim died of tuberculosis on October 14, 1858. His widow, Elizabeth, lived in the house until after the Civil War. In 1867 or 1869, she sold the house, the Collins Tract and the remainder of Lot Number20 to Charles Harmison (1823–1896) for $8,500, moving with her remaining children to Missouri (where she died in 1883). The cost of building the house financially strained the Parsons family; historian Catherine Snider Long suggests that Elizabeth Miller Parsons sold the house as a result of further, war-related, financial stress from which the family could not recover. = Harmison family = Charles Harmison was born in Franklin County, Illinois, to Nathaniel and Lydia Harmison, and married Bettie Ann Smith (1827–1903) on May 4, 1854, in Taylor County, West Virginia. Bettie, the daughter of C.C. and Martha W. Smith, was raised at Western View (their Fauquier County, Virginia, home). By 1867, Harmison and his family were living in Harrison County. His older brother had moved to Romney, where he established and operated the Virginia House hotel. In 1867, Charles Harmison's brother learned that the Parsons farm on the Collins Tract was for sale, and he advised Charles to buy it. Charles' wife, who wanted to live nearer to Virginia, also urged Charles to buy the property. Charles purchased the farm and he, his wife, their seven children, and a young African American boy named Snoden moved from Harrison County to Hampshire County in three days. They traveled on the Northwestern Turnpike in an ambulance Charles had bought after the war. Elizabeth Harmison named their new house and farm Valley View, which was influenced by the name of her childhood home, Western View, and the view of the South Branch Potomac River valley from their property. Harmison prospered in Hampshire County, acquiring adjacent properties and enlarging his Valley View estate. He later gave his acquired lands to his children to establish their own homes when they married. His farm was further changed in 1884, when the B&O; Railroad completed its South Branch line between the main B&O; line at Green Spring and Romney Depot. The South Branch line bisected the small valley to the immediate east of the house, which became known as Depot Valley. Charles Harmison died on October 31, 1896 after being thrown from a buggy. His son George Edward Harmison (1863–1916) inherited Valley View around 1903 and brought his wife, Carrie Belle Fox (1870–1953), there after their marriage on October 4, 1905. George demolished the old log kitchen at Valley View, replacing it with a contemporary one. In June 1909, construction commenced on the Hampshire Southern Railroad between its northern terminus on the B&O; Railroad's Romney Depot spur and the South Branch Potomac River within the bottomlands of George Harmison's farm. In October 1909, the first train on the Hampshire Southern line passed over Harmison's bottomlands and crossed the river on an unfinished trestle across the South Branch Potomac River. By 1910, the line from the Romney spur terminus at Valley View to McNeill was in operation. Later that year, freight and passenger service between Romney and Moorefield began, providing a direct rail link between Moorefield and the B&O; Railroad main line at Green Spring. The Hampshire Southern Railroad Company operated this line until 1911, when it was purchased by the Moorefield and Virginia Railroad Company. Moorefield and Virginia transferred the rail line to the B&O; Railroad Company in 1913, when it became part of the B&O;'s South Branch line. In 1911, George Harmison subdivided the Valley View fields on the Yellow Banks overlooking the South Branch Potomac River. The new development, known as the Valley View Addition to Romney, was south of the Valley View house and west of Romney Depot. Twenty-one lots were sold at public auction on September 27, 1911, and several more were sold privately. Harmison died in 1916, and Carrie continued to live at Valley View until her death on February 8, 1953. Harmison's nephew, Paul Cresap Harmison (1893–1972, a grandson of Charles Harmison's brother Jonathan Harmison), and his wife Nancy Parker Harmison (1896–1981) had moved to Valley View to live with her. After Carrie's death, Paul and Nancy Parker Harmison inherited the house and farm. Paul and Nancy's daughter Virginia Helen Harmison was married to Robert Esler in front of the fireplace in the home's living room on May 5, 1957. Valley View remained in the Harmison family until 1963, when it was sold to Philip Newell and his wife Martha. = Mayhew family = During its changes in ownership, the original Lot Number 20 of the South Branch Survey was repeatedly partitioned and sold. By 1976, the original property was divided into five farms and other parcels, including the Valley View Addition. The Valley View residence lies on a tract. Valley View was purchased by Robert Mayhew's father and a business associate in 1979. Mayhew later bought the house from his father, and he and his wife Kim restored the residence and its grounds. In 1991, the Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad began operating on the old B&O; South Branch line, which bisects the bottomlands below Valley View. After surveys of historic properties in the county, in 2008 the Hampshire County Historic Landmarks Commission and the Hampshire County Commission began an initiative to place structures and districts on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The county received funding from the State Historic Preservation Office of the West Virginia Division of Culture and History to survey and document the structure's architecture and history. As a result of this initiative, Valley View was one of the first eight historic properties to be considered for placement on the register. The other seven were Capon Chapel, Fort Kuykendall, Hickory Grove, Hook Tavern, North River Mills Historic District, Old Pine Church and Springfield Brick House. The house at Valley View was listed on the NRHP on December 12, 2012.  Architecture  The house at Valley View is significant for its Greek Revival architectural elements. According to architectural historian Courtney Fint Zimmerman, \\"Valley View is a characteristic example of the Greek Revival style for more practical residential applications in outlying areas\\". The Valley View house has several Greek Revival design characteristics, including a symmetrical architectural plan and elevations and \\"substantial, formal\\" mass. Zimmerman (who prepared Valley View's registration form for the NRHP) said, \\"Valley View's applied details in the Greek Revival style, including the front entrance entablature and portico, are more limited, yet the variations that can be seen on Valley View and other estates in the South Branch Valley illustrate the flexibility inherent in the style\\". According to Zimmerman, large houses like Valley View served as the \\"centers\\" of the plantations that formed the \\"basis of the local economy and social life\\" in Hampshire County. Valley View was added to the NRHP as a locally significant example of Greek Revival architecture. Valley View's house consists of the original 1855 brick section and a board-and- batten 1961–1962 kitchen addition. The grounds contain a smokehouse, a water well, the foundations of an ice house, and a summer kitchen. The bricks from which the house was built were fired in the immediate vicinity (along the banks of the South Branch Potomac River), and the brick walls were reinforced with hand-wrought structural iron angles. The nails used in its construction were fabricated by a local blacksmith, and the wooden sills and joists were sawn by hand. = Exterior = Valley View's house is a two-story brick structure with a rectangular architectural plan and exterior dimensions measuring about . The house's exterior brick walls are thick and laid in an American bond. The house is topped with a steep metal gabled roof with standing seam profiles. Two sets of double inside chimneys extend above the steep roofline on the northwestern and southeastern ends. The front façade of the house faces a hill to the southwest. It is five bays wide, with the front entrance at the first floor's center bay. Wide double-hung sash windows are uniformly placed on the house's front façade, with four nine-over-six double- hung wooden sashes on the first story and five six-over-six double-hung wooden sash windows on the second. Each window is surrounded by green-painted wooden shutters and white-painted wooden lintels and sills. The front entrance is covered by a small Greek Revival portico measuring about , topped with a pediment supported by wooden Doric columns and engaged columns at the wall. The front porch is flanked by modest wooden handrails and balusters on its left and right sides. The front entrance is post and lintel (trabeated) construction, with a six-pane transom and two three-pane sidelight windows around the doorway. Zimmerman suggests that \\"Big Jim\\" Parsons embellished his home's front entrance to assert his \\"wealth and status\\" and provide \\"an honored welcome to visitors\\". Valley View's rear elevation has a double wooden porch. The rear façade of the house faces northeast, across the South Branch Potomac River valley toward Mill Creek Mountain. A two-story (double) wooden porch about deep extends across the rear of the house, topped by a shed roof extending from the main gabled roof at a shallower pitch. The first-story porch supports are brown wooden turned posts with no handrail or balusters, and the porch's second story has white painted square wood posts and vertical railings. Like the front façade, the rear façade is five bays wide; access to the double porch is through a door in the central bay on both levels. The other four bays have nine-over-six double-hung wooden sash windows on the first story and six-over-six double-hung wooden sash windows on the second story. The northwestern and southeastern sides of the house have one small square window at attic level, between each pair of inside chimneys. = Interior = The interior of the Valley View house has a two-room-deep, central-hallway floor plan. Its wide central hallway contains a staircase from the first floor to the attic, with a wooden handrail supported with square balusters and a modest wooden turned newel post. The ceilings are high. Although the house's foundation is low, the height of the interior walls and the full-sized attic make the house appear tall from the outside. The original house has eight large rooms, each with a fireplace framed by a wooden geometric trabeated mantelpiece with classical elements. The four large rooms on the first floor open from either side of the center hallway. They contain simple wide wood trim, including skirting boards and door frame moldings with \\"subtly demarcated corners\\". The house's living and dining rooms have wide, wooden dado rails. Most of the wooden decorative trim is painted white, and the walls are plaster. The lone exception is the room serving as an office and den, which has dark stained wooden trim and interior brick structural walls (exposed by the removal of its plaster during the 1960s). All rooms have the original wide plank wooden floors. The second floor has four bedrooms, with closets on either side of a fireplace and simple wood skirting boards and door frames. Parsons family members painted signatures and graffiti in the attic around 1856, which remain visible on the stairwell wall. = Kitchen addition = A one-story kitchen addition, built in 1961–1962 and measuring about , extends from the northwest side of the original 1855 house. The addition has a gabled standing seam metal roof, and its exterior is covered in white-painted board-and-batten siding. It has a vinyl bay window on the southwest side, a one-over-one double-hung vinyl window on the northeast side and a door (adjoining the wall of the 1855 house) on the southeast side. An enclosed board-and-batten porch, measuring about , and a shed roof extend from the front (southwest) of the kitchen addition. The original basement under the 1855 house is accessible through this porch extension. A ghost building outline on the northwest side of the 1855 house indicates an earlier structure where the present kitchen addition stands. = Ancillary structures = There are several ancillary structures near the house at Valley View, including a smokehouse and a water well, and the foundations of an ice house and a summer kitchen. Although the smokehouse, the summer kitchen and the ice house are believed to have been built by the Collinses before Big Jim Parsons built Valley View, the dates of construction are uncertain. The smokehouse, measuring about , is adjacent to the kitchen addition. It is set into a hillside, allowing at-grade entry to its two levels. Built of square-cut logs with white chinking atop a rubble masonry foundation, the smokehouse is topped with a standing seam metal gabled roof. South of the smokehouse is the brick foundation of an ice house measuring about and topped by modern wooden pergola and patio structures. The brick foundation of Valley View's summer kitchen is north of the smokehouse and topped by a contemporary wooden pavilion with a gabled roof. In the rear yard of the house is a water well, enclosed by a brick building about in area and in height. In the center of the well cap is a metal hand pump. Although the well cap's bricks are similar to those used in the construction of the main house, the well may date from an earlier residence on the site.

Donizo (also Domnizo, Donizone) of Canossa, was an Italian monk and author in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries. His work is an important source on Matilda of Tuscany and her dynasty, and also on Gregorian Reform and the Investiture Controversy more generally. Life Donizo was born c.1071/2, perhaps at Canossa or at Parma. He became a monk at the Benedictine monastery of Sant’Apollonio of Canossa c.1086/7. By 1136 he was abbot of the monastery. Works He composed several works in Latin, including the Enarratio Genesis, a fragmentary commentary on the Book of Genesis, of which 378 leonine verses remain. His most famous work is the Vita Mathildis (Life of Matilda), written in leonine hexameters. The Life is divided into two books, the first of which entitled, De Principibus Canusinis (‘'On the princes of Canossa’'), concentrates on the ancestors of Matilda of Tuscany, and their possession of the castle of Canossa; the second book focuses on Matilda herself. The Vita Mathildis was written between 1111 and 1115. It was completed shortly after Matilda died in July 1115 and was thus hastily re-dedicated to Empress Matilda.

Sree, the debutant director, began working on the script after apprenticing under Shankar during the production of Enthiran, and noted that the film would star Vaibhav and Remya Nambeesan. He revealed that it would be a dark comedy thriller film, with Vaibhav portraying a software engineer. The director reported in November 2013 that 85 percent of the film was complete, with only songs left to be shot. Thaman recorded a song with the lead actress Remya Nambeesan for the soundtrack.

Credible performances from its leads and a nail-biting screenplay makes it an engaging trip. Damaal Dumeel is an enjoyable and racy fun ride\\". M Suganth of The Times of India, giving the film 3 stars out of 5, termed the film \\"a worthy attempt\\" and further wrote, \\"Right in the opening shot [sic] we realize that we are in the hands of a competent filmmaker and Sree keeps things moving at a brisk pace till the end. Even the romantic track is used only in small doses and the director doesn't allow a possible melancholic moment to linger\\". IANS also gave 3 stars out of 5 and called it \\"a reasonably good dark comedy that you seldom see from an industry that has an urge for predominantly making masala entertainers\\". Behindwoods gave 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Unlike the usual commercial masala that we get to watch every second Friday, Damaal Dumeel slips into the crux of the story right after the public service advertisement on smoking is played and clutches onto it right till the end.

Baradwaj Rangan wrote, \\"This is ...one of those films that you need to keep watching keeping this caveat in mind: “For a first-time filmmaker...” Sree has some clever ideas...The problem, as with a lot of Tamil cinema, is the distance between intent and execution. On the face of it — if we look at just the plot summaries — we seem to be doing wonderfully fresh and exciting work. But the ideas in the filmmakers’ heads lose steam when put on paper and, thereon, are translated to screen\\". Deccan Chronicle wrote, \\"The film is good in parts. Right from the start there’s pace – something that is refreshing. The build up to the climax, interspersed with some laughs thanks to Charlie are notable\\". Rediff gave 2 stars out of 5 and wrote, Damaal Dumeel captures the attention of the viewer at the start and also maintains a healthy pace, but one feels let down. The film doesn't convey a sense of the desperation of the situation and of all hell breaking lose. Despite its faults, the film is engaging in parts\\".

Based in Germany, the company opened its first store in Berlin Prenzlauer Berg, in the summer of 2011, with 250 square metres of space. Since July 2017, Veganz has four branches, three in Berlin and one in Prague.\\"Stores\\" veganz.com The group turnover increased by 28 % to 26.6 million Euros in the whole of 2019.https://www.presseportal.de/pm/137749/4504558 Veganz employs around 64 people.https://veganz.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/prospekt-veganz- group-ag-approval-version-20191220.pdf The company motto is \\"Gut für dich, besser für alle\\" (Good for you, better for everyone).https://veganz.de/  Development and History  Veganz was founded in 2011 by Jan Bredack, a former senior manager at Mercedes Benz. Wanting to simplify vegan food shopping by bundling vegan products in one sales point, he started to build a chain of vegan supermarkets. When the company opened its first store in Berlin, Bredack told the Berliner Zeitung that he had anticipated 100 customers a day, but instead averaged 400. More supermarkets were opened across Europe, but the sales volume declined and the concept proved ineffective. The imminent extinction of this business branch caused a change in strategy and Veganz began to transition into a wholesaler, starting its own production in 2015. The supermarket branch was declared bankrupt. Since 2016, Veganz’ main business consists of distribution and wholesale, with a small remaining side business of three supermarkets in Berlin and one in Prague. In 2019, the GmbH turned into an AG and issued bonds in 2020 with an initial interest rate of 7,5%. This step enabled the raise of funds for further growth and international expansion. Products and customers Veganz, Warschauer Straße, Berlin Veganz supermarkets sell only vegan goods. In their own Veganz outlets the company offers a balanced, full-range assortment of over 4,500 products from more than 30 countries to their customers, including 45 different kinds of plant milk and cream, vegan ice-creams, mayonnaise and other dressings, mock meats, fish substitutes such as veggie fish steaks, breads, pastries, and 80 vegan cheeses. There is vegan chocolate, biscuits, sweets, food for companion animals, coffee, toiletries and cosmetics. The company's goal is to establish the brand Veganz as a synonym for fair trade, ethical and sustainable business and for products that are devoid of animal suffering. They place the utmost importance on natural and organic foods choices. 85 percent of the sold products are certified organic.\\"Ueber Veganz\\", veganz.de In the spring of 2015, the company launched their own brand for vegan products. By the end of the year, a product range of around 50 plant-based products was available, with about 100 more to follow in 2016. Today, Veganz is one of the few companies worldwide that offer a full range of vegan products. Their assortment includes sweets, meat-, fish- and cheese alternatives, protein products, breakfast items, chilled goods and frozen food. All products are strictly plant-based and a large part is certified organic. Veganz regularly introduces innovative plant-based alternatives, such as ‘The Gourmet’, a mock-cheese based on cashews that won the PETA vegan food award in 2020.https://www.peta.de/vegan-food-award-2019 Veganz further launched a vegan smoked salmon alternative based on Atlantic seaweed. This global novelty is low in CO2 in production, protecting the world’s fish stocks and at the same time outperforming conventional salmon in its omega-3 share. According to Bredack, most of his customers are between 18 and 34 years old, although the over-55 age group is increasing. About 60 percent of the store customers are vegan and 10 percent of them are tourists.  Partners and availability  Veganz products are internationally listed in the UK, Belgium, Slowenia, Switzerland, Denmark, Austria, Czech Republic, Portugal, Singapore and South Africa. They are marketed in the following drug stores and discounters (amongst others): dm, Müller, REWE, Lidl, Globus, Kaufland, Spar, COOP, Vegasme, Wholefoods and Planet Organic.  Corporate philosophy and objectives  Veganz strives to facilitate a plant-based, environmentally conscious lifestyle for everyone by making vegan products more accessible.https://veganz.com/about-us/ This aim is expressed in the company motto is “Good for you, better for everyone”. Transparency is a major aspect of Veganz’ corporate culture. To make the environmental and ethical impact of each good more comprehensible for consumers, in 2019, the company introduced a sustainability score in cooperation with the Swiss institute ‘eaternity’.

After listening to the script and liking the concept, Anirudh turned down the offer on making his acting debut and agreed to compose the film's music. The director then cast newcomer Geethan Britto, Arjunan and Swaminathan to play significant roles in the film, noting that the title \\"Aakko\\" is slang for the term \\"Aarva Kolaaru\\", which translates into \\"enthusiastic youngster\\". Anirudh revealed that he accepted to compose the music to test his star status in the market.

It was not intended to be a permanent feature of the social security system. It was abolished by the Social Security Act 1986 and replaced by Family Credit. Half of the amount by which the claimant's income fell below £15/week was paid, plus £2 for each additional child, to a maximum of £3/week (revised to £4/week). In addition, those in receipt were given entitlement to free school meals, and passported to the NHS Low Income Scheme. Claimants were required to provide payslips, to prove they were in remunerative full-time work, for a minimum of 30 hours per week, or 24 hours for single parents. In 1985, differential rates for children under 11, from 11–15 and over 16 were introduced. There was a maximum payment in order to prevent abuse by claimants or employers deliberately reducing or understating earnings. Once entitlement was established, it continued for 52 weeks regardless of changes in circumstances. Entitlement was calculated with respect to gross income, which exacerbated the poverty trap. Each extra £1 a week in gross earnings would reduce weekly Family Income Supplement by 50p, on top of which most claimants would be subject to income tax and National Insurance Contributions of at least 30p, producing a very high marginal withdrawal rate. Additionally loss of entitlement took with it entitlement to health and education benefits.

Barkwell, Lawrence. http://www.metismuseum.ca/resource.php/13798 The Métis were victorious. It was the last major battle between the two groups. The buffalo hunt was a yearly event for the Métis of the Red River Colony. After sowing their fields in the spring they set out with their wives and children leaving the aged and infirm to take care of the crop. Their principal settlement was situated on the banks of the Red River of the North in what is now the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Made up largely of French Métis they would leave for the summer buffalo hunt around the middle of June and returned in the middle of August with their pemmican and dried meat. Often harassed by the Sioux the Métis from the various settlements of Red River traveled in large groups for defence. The battle Paul Kane's oil painting depicting a Métis buffalo hunt on the prairies of Dakota in June 1846 Map showing the general locations of the tribes and subtribes of the Sioux by the late 18th century; current reservations are shown in orange. Chief Medicine Bear in 1872 The 1851 buffalo hunt initially proceeded as follows. The St. Boniface group made rendezvous with the Pembina group on June 16 then traveled west to meet the St. François Xavier group (June 19). There were 1,300 people, 1,100 carts and 318 hunters in the combined groups. The groups hunted separately but planned to unite against any threat from the Sioux. They divided into 3 groups about from each other moving in the same direction. The St. François Xavier (White Horse Plain) group led by Jean Baptiste Falcon, son of Pierre Falcon, and accompanied by its missionary, Father Louis-François Richer Laflèche numbered 200 carts and 67 hunters plus women and children. In North Dakota on the Grand Coteau of the Missouri on July 12 the scouts of St. François Xavier spotted a large band of Sioux. The five scouts riding back to warn the camp met with a party of 20 Sioux who surrounded them. Two made a run for it under fire but 3 were kept as captives. Two would escape the next day and one killed. On Sunday July 13 the camp was attacked by the Sioux. Lafleche dressed in a black cassock, white surplice, and stole, directed with the camp commander Jean Baptiste Falcon a miraculous defense against 2,000 Sioux combatants, holding up a crucifix during the battle. After a siege of two days (July 13 and 14), the Sioux withdrew, convinced that the Great Spirit protected the Métis. According to subsequent accounts the Sioux leaders are supposed to have said, before they gave up their attacks, \\"They have a Shaman,\\" meaning Fr. Lafleche. \\"We cannot overpower them.\\" The Coteau du Missouri, or Missouri Plateau, is a plateau that stretches along the eastern side of the valley of the Missouri River in central North Dakota and north-central South Dakota in the United States and extends into Saskatchewan and Alberta in Canada. The Coteau du Missouri can also refer to a line of rolling hills on the eastern edge of the Missouri Plateau.

The Leader is currently owned by Tribune Publishing, and operates as a subsidiary of The Baltimore Sun.  History = Paper ownership = In 1897, James Curley founded The Leader in Laurel. Between 1897 and 1980, the ownership passed from Curley to G. Bowie McCeney to Gertrude Poe. In July 1980, Patuxent Publishing Company bought the newspaper. In September 1997, Patuxent Publishing was sold to The Baltimore Sun which was a subsidiary of Times Mirror. In June 2000, Tribune Publishing purchased Times Mirror and thus the Baltimore Sun, Patuxent Publishing, and the Laurel Leader. = James Curley era (1897–1938) = In 1897 attorney James Curley founded The Leader, a weekly newspaper serving the approximately 2,600 residents of the city of Laurel, MD.1900 U.S. Census It replaced the Free Quill, one of at least six newspapers which existed in the city in the second half of the nineteenth century. Curley created the Leader to \\"further his business interests and rally local Republicans,\\" and the paper focused on national and sensational news rather than local news. Of the eight pages published each week, six consisted of national and international news while the only two were devoted to local news as well as advertisements. Curley was the paper's editor until 1938, when he gave up a half-interest in the paper as partial repayment of a mortgage debt, and sold the other half to the debt collector, G. Bowie McCeney. = Gertrude Poe era (1938–1980) = After James Curley sold the paper to G. Bowie McCeney, McCeney served as editor for six months before appointing Gertrude Poe editor in 1939. Poe had previously worked in McCeney's office and had recently graduated from American University's law school when she was hired as the Leader's editor rather than joining McCeney's firm as an attorney. \\"He [McCeney] hands me a copy [of the Leader] with a grin and says, 'My career as an editor just ended. Yours is just beginning.\\" Poe served as the Leader's editor until 1980, while McCeney remained the paper's publisher until 1978. In 1946 the paper's name was changed to The News Leader, after merging with the Bowie Register and The College Park News, two other papers owned by McCeney. From 1939 until the late 1950s, the Leader was a \\"one woman show,\\" with Poe serving as advertising salesperson, graphic designer, copywriter, proofreader, and distributor as well as editor.Louis Peddicord, \\"Gertude Poe, Lady Editor,\\" Maryland Magazine, Summer 1975, p. 42 Under Poe's leadership the focus of the paper shifted from national to local news, and increasingly catered to the local military population based at nearby Fort Meade. In addition, the paper made a strong effort to focus on positive news in the city. In 1992 Poe was quoted in an interview stating: \\"Maybe I was a little lopsided...I still think the media in general focuses too much on the bad news...There are so many good people. That exposure in the paper means so much to them and their stories can inspire others.\\" During Poe's tenure as editor the Leader covered major national news stories related to Laurel, including the attempted assassination of presidential candidate George Wallace and the destruction of the 9th Street Bridge and several parts of downtown Laurel during Hurricane Agnes. For her work, Poe received a number of major awards and honors. In 1958 she was the first woman elected president of the Maryland Press Association, the first woman elected to that position, and in 1967 was the second ever winner of the Emma C. McKinney Award given by the National Newspaper Association. In 1987 she was the first ever living person elected into the Maryland–Delaware–D.C. Press Association Hall of Fame, and in 2011 she was elected to the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame. = Karen Yengich era (1980–1990) = In 1980, Poe retired as editor and sold the paper to newspaper chain Patuxent Publishing Company, who renamed it The Laurel Leader and appointed Assistant Editor Karen Yengich as editor. Yengich had worked for the Leader for eight years; her first assignment was to cover George Wallace's speech at Laurel Shopping Center on May 18, 1972, where Arthur Bremer attempted to assassinate Wallace. Yengich oversaw an increased focus in the paper on photography and feature articles, with a strong interest in the city's growth. She was awarded the John Hay Whitney Award in 1988, which included a year spent working at the International Herald Tribune in Paris. = Joe Murchison era (1990–2007) = When Yengich left the Leader in 1990 she was replaced by Joe Murchison, a longtime professional journalist who had previously worked for the Fauquier Democrat, Richmond News Leader, and Columbia Flier, and who had been a reporter at the Leader since 1985, serving as acting editor in 1988–89 while Yengich was taking a year of absence. Under Murchison's guidance, the paper shifted from a broadsheet format to tabloid in January 1994, and changed from a paid to free circulation model. While Murchison was editor of the paper, major stories which appeared in the Leader included its local coverage of the 9/11 terror attacks. Hijacker Hani Hanjour had stayed at the Valencia Motel in Laurel prior to the attack. In 2007 Murchison retired as editor of the Leader. He currently serves as Executive Director of Side by Side, a non-profit organization based in Laurel. = Melanie Dzwonchyk era (2008–present) = From 2007 to 2008, the editor of the Laurel Leader was Pete Pichaske. In August 2008 he was replaced by Melanie Dzwonchyk, who began working at the Leader as a freelance writer in 1993 and joined the paper's staff in 1995, serving as features editor under Joe Murchison. Several months later, in December 2008, the Leader's offices moved to the Patuxent Publishing Co. headquarters in Columbia, Maryland, and in December 2013 the Leader moved again, this time to the Baltimore Sun building in Baltimore, Maryland. In January 2014, Dzwonchyk was appointed news editor of the Howard County Times and the Columbia Flier, while continuing as editor of the Leader. = In popular culture = The Leader was the focus of a \\"Ripped from the Headlines: Laurel in the News\\" exhibit which opened at the Laurel Museum in February 2015 and explored the paper's coverage of local and national news throughout its existence.

The film was released in Telugu as Mande Suryudu (English: Burning Sun). Plot The story begins in Goa, where six dead bodies are washed ashore. The Goa drug lord, Jothi (Ashutosh Rana), is responsible for this. The Police Department of India is unable to capture him for nearly a decade because not a single person has seen him in person as he is constantly on the move and has no permanent aides or accomplices. Chitti (Mahadevan) is in charge for the drug trafficking in and around Goa. One day, he receives a call from Jothi about a missing drug consignment. Chitti and his men are unable to hunt down the culprit. It is revealed that Shiva (Arya) is the mastermind behind the drug theft and is working for Chitti as his most trusted henchman. Chitti, along with Shiva and his nephew Guru (Harish Uthaman), runs an underworld drug empire in Goa. In a turn of events, we see that Shiva is actually Arul, an undercover police officer who is assigned to expose Jothi and his entire drug cartel. He receives instructions from his higher officers Bharathi (Anupama Kumar) and Benjamin Vas (O. A. K. Sundar) and informs them about all the activities of his gang from time to time. Arul is into this mission along with his best friend and colleague, Karthik (Ramana), who also takes a stage name as Maanik and works for Sharma (Ashish Vidyarthi), another drug lord from Mumbai, who is in possession of 1000 kg of pure heroin and is looking for a buyer. The plan of Bharathi, Benjamin, and their team is to make Sharma and Jothi meet each other for the transaction of the 1000 kg of heroin and then arrest them. Arul informs Bharathi that Sharma and Jothi are planning for a trial with just 100 kg of heroin, and if all goes well, they will deal with the remaining 900 kg. Bharathi and her team wisely plan to capture the huge bulk of 900 kg of drugs, along with Sharma and Jothi, so they have to leave the first trial transaction unmonitored. However, all plans go awry when Bharathi's jealous boss does not agree to her plan and conducts a raid for the trial transaction in the last moment. This exposes Karthik, and he is taken to Chitti's place and gets tortured by Guru and his gang to reveal the identity of any other man working with him. Unable to bear the pain, Karthik reveals that Arul is the other undercover officer. Guru informs Chitti about Arul's true identity, and when they attempt to kill him, Arul guns down Chitti and starts eliminating all the gang members, including Guru. Soon, Arul finds Karthik, but within moments, Karthik dies. Jothi is now aware of the death of Chitti and his entire crew and uses his influence to the police officers to bring Arul into his custody. So the police force and Jothi's men join hands and hunt for Arul. Arul, all alone on this mission, still continues his own plan to expose Jothi and gets himself captured on purpose. Now that he has nothing to lose, he plans to play a final game of chance to meet Jothi face to face, earn his trust, and join as henchman again. Arul is the only survivor of the shootout at Chitti's place, and so only his account to Jothi will earn his trust. Arul is brought to Jothi for the first time and is also able to cleverly convince him, but only up to an extent. He tells Jothi that his former partner-turned-archenemy Rane (Sudhanshu Pandey) is responsible for the drug theft (mentioned at the beginning) and shootout at Chitti's place. Jothi had been thinking Rane was dead, but now Rane is actually alive and is plotting his revenge. Jothi is still skeptical, so Arul is given two days to prove that Rane is alive and has done all these things. Arul succeeds by getting help from a prostitute (Sanjana Singh) whom he helped earlier. He places all the stolen drugs at Rane's house and leads Jothi's men there, and they find the lost drugs. Jothi asks his men to kill Rane and his gang. Shiva cleverly does certain manipulations, kills Rane and his men, and places his own guns in Rane's hands. This leads Jothi and his men to believe that Rane's gun and the one used in the shootout at Chitti's place are the same. The gun is also sent for ballistic testing to check on Shiva's story, and they all believe Shiva's story is true. Soon, Jothi asks Arul to join his gang and meet him at a secluded place. When Arul waits for the opportunity to gun down Jothi, he gets beaten up by his men. It is then revealed that Usha (Hansika Motwani), his neighbor who has a huge crush on him, had been secretly recording videos of him on her phone for her to admire, but her phone falls into the hands of Jothi's men. They find whom Arul has been meeting and dealing with so far and come to know he is also an undercover cop. As a result, Bharathi and Benjamin are assassinated by Jothi's men. Jothi and his men beat Arul savagely, keep him bound in a harbor, and ask him the whereabouts of Sharma's remaining 900 kg of heroin. Arul whispers the location, and as Jothi comes closer to hear him, Arul spits out a blade at his eye. When all of Jothi's men are distracted, Arul escapes from his captors and kills them, leaving Jothi alone, and arrests him. Since nobody alive has seen Jothi in person, his arrest is unavoidable, and no political influence will work out. As the credits roll, Arul rejects Usha's proposal and asks her to focus on her life. He then moves on to his next mission and kills Sharma and seizes the remaining 900 kg of heroin.

More than fifty were built. Design and development The Specht was designed by Rudolph Kaiser, who around 1952 was dividing his time between Scheibe in Dachau and Schleicher in Poppenhausen. Hence the Specht and its contemporary Schleicher Ka-4 Rhönlerche, also designed by Kaiser, have much in common. The Specht has a wooden, two spar, high wing, braced on each side by V-struts from the spars to the lower fuselage, jury struts and mounted with 2° of dihedral. There is plywood skinning from the leading edge to the rear spar on the upper surface and to the forward spar below. The leading edge of the wing is straight and unswept and the trailing edge is parallel to it over its inner section, becoming tapered outboard. Ailerons, with inset hinges, fill these sections. Spoilers are mounted in the mid-inner wing panels at 11% chord. Scheibe used their usual fabric covered, steel tube and wooden stringer construction for the fuselage. Pupil and instructor sit in tandem in an enclosed cockpit, with the rear seat accessed by an under wing door. The fuselage, flat sided and hexagonal in section, narrows to the conventional tail. The horizontal tail, mounted on top of the fuselage, is roughly rectangular in plan and of low aspect ratio and the fin and rudder together are straight tapered and flat topped. The rudder is hinged behind the elevators and extends down to the keel. The Specht lands on a fixed monowheel under the rear seat, assisted by a central skid. The Specht prototype first flew in March 1953. Just three years (7 March 1956) later Scheibe flew the Sperber (), a side by side seat version. Necessarily wider in the cockpit area, the two types differed little, though the Sperber's span was greater and it was slightly () heavier. Their performances were also very similar; the Sperber's minimum sink rate was 7% greater. Operational history Fifty-five Spechts were produced. These were used by gliding clubs for pilot training in place of the earlier, open, single-seat primary gliders like the Zögling and its descendants. A few remained on the European civil aircraft registers in 2010. In 2009 at least two of these were flight worthy, each with historic aircraft groups in Denmark and Norway; in Sweden a third Specht, with a certificate of airworthiness valid into 2015, is owned by a similar group. Only five Sperbers were built, one of which remained on the German civil aircraft register in 2010. Variants ;Specht: 1953 tandem-seat trainer, 55 built. ;Sperber: 1956 side- by-side-seat version, slightly wider and with a slightly greater span, otherwise almost identical; 5 built.

The families travelled in three parties from Port Elizabeth, the last arriving at the Salem site on July 23rd. The name is of biblical origin () and, proclaimed the Sunday after their arrival by the Reverend Shaw, means 'peace'; the local application refers to a reconciliation between sects. A church built from mud blocks and thatch was consecrated in 1824, and replaced by a stone structure in 1832. The church often served as a refuge for women and children during the Frontier Wars. Several settler houses, built in the Georgian style, have been preserved. In December 2017 the Constitutional Court upheld a land claim lodged in respect of the Salem Commonage by descendants of the black community that previously occupied the land.

The name of the label Go Get Organized comes from a song by the Redskins; it enhances the commitment of this generation’s independent labels. It was founded in 1988 by a group of artists and musicians. The label explored a surprisingly large panel of genres at the time, going through garage rock, hardcore, stoner rock, grunge, noise music, no wave, jazz-core and industrial music. The label soon stands out from other French labels and the alternative music stage by looking for on unusual artists, taking a particular interest in grunge music, American noise rock, experimental and minimalist music such as the work of the very controversial Patrick Dorobisz, Moodie Black, Dookoom, Genghis Khan or Schlaasss. In 1992, the label signs a licensing agreement for Monster Magnet’s first album Spine Of GodSpine Of God - Monster Magnet (album) - Volumeet with Primo Scree. In 1993, the label changes its name and becomes Agony (Agony and the Ecstasy). Agony (1993 – 2012) then became GGO, turning more toward noise rock with bands such as Enablers, Davy Jones Locker, Heliogabale or Kill the Thrill before becoming Atypeek Music in 2013. It is also during this year that its previous productions and new artists are shared on digital platforms. Atypeek Music stays under the artistic direction of Christophe Féray. Atypeek Music has taken in artists from partner labels like Disques Futura et Marge (Futura Marge),Futura Marge Noise Product, Dokidoki, Solar Flare, Permis de Construire Deutschland (PDCD), micr0lab and RecRec Music.RecRec Music Atypeek Music's distributed on iTunes and all the major digital music distribution stores.

As its support base amongst academic institutions grew and as more institutions and people came to know about and champion the scientific approach to animal problems that ULAWS stood for, the name of the society was changed, in 1938, to the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare (UFAW). UFAW's aims were: * To enlist the influence of university men and women on behalf of animals, wild and domestic; * To promote, by educational and other methods, interest in the welfare of animals in Great Britain and abroad; * To lessen, by methods appropriate to the special character of a university organisation, the pain and fear inflicted on animals by man; * To obtain and disseminate accurate information relating to animal welfare; * To further and promote legislation for the protection of animals. Since its foundation, UFAW has initiated many advances in animal welfare including the first handbook aimed at improving the care and management of laboratory animals (now on its 7th edition),Worden AN (1947) The UFAW handbook on the care and management of laboratory animals; with an appendix on statistical analysis.

Wiley-Blackwell the first programme of research on environmental enrichment (in zoo animals) and involvement in the Brambell Committee whose report into the welfare of animals kept under intensive livestock husbandry systems led to the formation of the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Committee (later Farm Animal Welfare Council – FAWC) and the concept of the Five Freedoms. Examples of more recent activities include funding of the work, at the University of Bristol, investigating the use of the concept of cognitive bias to assess the subjective emotional state of an animal – pessimistic or optimistic – and hence their welfare. UFAW has also supported work on genetic welfare problems of companion animals and produced a web resource that describes a range of genetic conditions that affect companion animals and which explains their welfare consequences – the impacts on the animals' quality of life. UFAW established the Garden Bird Health Initiative (GBHi) to develop and publish guidelines about garden birds aimed at maximizing their welfare and conservation. A new strain of avian pox, for example, is an area of developing concern within the UK. As part of its remit to educate and inform on animal welfare, UFAW has also produced a series of books, in collaboration with Wiley-Blackwell Science, that seek to provide an authoritative source of information on worldwide developments, current thinking and best practice in the field of animal welfare science and technology.List of books in the UFAW Animal Welfare Series published by Wiley-Blackwell In 1987, the Council Members became also the Trustees of the Humane Slaughter Association (HSA). The HSA and UFAW are financially independent but have worked closely together for many years to advance farm animal welfare. The HSA works to improve farm animal welfare 'beyond the farm gate' – during transport, at markets and at slaughter. The Three Rs UFAW originated and supports the principle of the 'Three R's' in the use of animals in scientific procedures. In 1954 UFAW's founder, Charles Hume, together with other members of UFAW's Council, wished to see laboratory techniques become more humane for the animals concerned and appointed an Oxford zoologist Dr William Russell to undertake a programme of research into this subject. UFAW Research Fellow Dr Russell, along with his laboratory assistant and co-author Rex Burch, published the results of their work in 1959 as The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique (reprinted in 1992).Russell WMS and Burch RL (1959. Reprinted 1992). The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique. Universities Federation for Animal Welfare: Wheathampstead, UK This publication introduced the concept of the 'Three Rs' – of Replacement, Reduction and Refinement – which in due course came to be adopted as the guiding principle for the welfare of research animals worldwide and is now required by regulatory authorities in many countries.Fenwick NP and D Fraser (2005) The Three Rs in the pharmaceutical industry: perspectives of scientists and regulators. Animal Welfare 14:367-377 The Three Rs are: * Replacement – the use of non-animal subjects wherever possible, and research into development and validation of new non-animal research and testing models; * Reduction – where replacement is not currently possible, the minimising of the number of animals used by, for example, better research design, appropriate statistical methods and use of information databases; * Refinement – improvement of experimental procedures and aspects of housing and husbandry so as to minimise risks to welfare. A good deal of UFAW's work, including the Hume Animal Welfare Research Fellowship, the Animal Welfare Research Training Scholarship and other research grants, the UFAW 3Rs Liaison Group, and participation in working groups, has been focused in areas directly related to promoting the Three Rs. A special edition of UFAW's Animal Welfare journal devoted to the Three Rs, and including an article by Professor Russell entitled The Three Rs: past, present and future,Russell WMS (2005) The Three Rs: past, present and future. Animal Welfare 14:279-286 was published in 2005 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the project leading to the publication of the book. The science journal Animal Welfare Animal Welfare is a scientific and technical journal, first produced by UFAW in 1992. It publishes the results of peer-reviewed scientific research, technical studies and reviews relating to the welfare of kept animals (e.g. on farms, in laboratories, zoos and as companions) and of those in the wild whose welfare is compromised by human activities. Papers on related ethical and legal issues are also considered for publication.

The first thorough study was carried out in 1977–1979 by UFAW.Hunting With Dogs HANSARD, 18 March 2002. The UFAW Handbook on the Care and Management of Farm Animals was first published in 1971 and in 2013 reached its fourth edition. The UFAW Handbook on the Care and Management of Laboratory and other Research Animals was first published in 1947 and reached its eight edition in 2010.

Fountain commemorating Wertheim in the Wertheimpark in Amsterdam Abraham Carel Wertheim, also known as A.C. Wertheim (Amsterdam, 12 December 1832 – Amsterdam, 30 November 1897) was a banker, politician, and philanthropist from Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Born into a family of emancipated and enlightened Dutch Jews, he developed his banking and investment skills at Wertheim & Gompertz, an investment firm founded by his uncle Johannes Wertheim. He was subsequently apprentice at prominent banker Julius Königswärter, who introduced him into cultural salons in Amsterdam. Upon his marriage to his cousin Rosalie Marie Wertheim he became a partner in Wertheim & Gompertz. This bank, together with a number of other firms, played a significant role in financing the building of new railroads in the United States. He was a patron of amateur drama in Amsterdam, and stimulated the development of the (later Royal) Dutch National Theatre Company (Vereeniging Het Nederlandsch Tooneel), soon the only major theatre company in the city. It played at the Municipal Theatre and the Grand Théatre. Wertheim was intimately involved in the rebuilding of the Municipal Theatre on the Leidseplein square after it burnt down in 1890. He was a mason. He was involved in a large number of Jewish communal organisations in Amsterdam, including being the president of the Jewish community. While he was not observant himself, he did not advocate reform and considered Orthodoxy the only representative movement within Judaism. As a liberal politician he was a member of the States- Provincial for North Holland (1866-1886) and from 1886 until his death of the Senate. He was a Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion. He is commemorated in the Wertheimpark in Amsterdam East, which contains a monument dedicated to him. He had eight children, of whom three died in childhood. His brother-in-law was Barend Joseph Stokvis. His nephew was pedagogist Philip Kohnstamm, and his grandchildren were composer Rosy Wertheim and sculptor Jobs Wertheim.

The Commission then sifts those complaints and determines if they are service-related (in which case the SLCC has jurisdiction) or conduct- related. If complaints are related to the conduct of a solicitor the complaints are referred to the Law Society of Scotland, whose Council can determine if the complaint relates to unsatisfactory conduct (which the Law Society deals with internally) or professional misconduct which is then prosecuted before the Tribunal. Should the Tribunal determine that a case relates to unsatisfactory conduct then the case is referred to the Law Society. = Section 53(1)(b) Complaint = A Section 53(1)(b) complaint is a complaint that a solicitor has been convicted by a court in an act involving dishonesty, fined in amount equivalent to level 4 on the standard scale, or sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 12 months or more. = Appellate jurisdiction = The Tribunal deals with the following appeals: * Applications for restoration to the Roll of Solicitors and Applications for Removal of a Restriction on a practising certificate * Appeals by solicitors / lay complainers against findings / failure to make findings of unsatisfactory professional conduct. In relation to Section 42ZA Appeal, the Tribunal can: # Quash or Confirm the Determination of the Law Society. # Quash the Censure accompanying the Determination. # Quash/Confirm/Vary the Direction being appealed against. # Order retraining of the solicitor. # Impose a Fine not exceeding £2,000. # Order compensation to be paid to the lay complainer not exceeding £5,000. = Penalties = In relation to professional misconduct complaints, the Tribunal can: # Censure. # Impose a Fine of up to £10,000. # Impose a Restriction on a Solicitor’s practising certificate. # Suspend the Solicitor for a period of time. # Strike the Solicitor’s name from the Roll of Solicitors in Scotland. # If the Tribunal considers that the Secondary Complainer has been directly affected by the misconduct, the Tribunal has power to direct the solicitor to pay compensation of such amount not exceeding £5,000 as the Tribunal may specify for any loss, inconvenience or distress resulting from the misconduct.

It is known today primarily from a sixteenth-century cast now held at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (Inventory # VI 1), which until 1986 was mistakenly regarded as the original. Until the twentieth century, the statue was also known as the Youth of HelenenbergWerner Fantur, Kärnten im Mosaik der Erde. Verlag Carinthia, Klagenfurt 1974, pp. 47–52 Chapter \\"Der Jüngling vom Helenenberg\\" from the old name for Magdalensberg.Gernot Piccottini, Die besten Skulpturen der Austria Romana, in Wolbert Ebner (Ed.), Das ist Kärnten, 5. Aufl. Klagenfurt 2003, pp. 18–19. The youth is the only ancient full-size bronze statue known from the Eastern Alpine region and therefore is of great significance in Austria.  Description  The bronze statue shows a naked youth standing still, of about life size (1.85 metres high, 6'1\\"). In its contrapposto stance, the right leg is load-bearing, while the left is free, barely touching the ground with its toes. The left arm hangs free, the right hand is held out at shoulder height. The head is turned slightly to the right, following the gesture of the right hand. An inscription is incised on the right thigh:. :A[ulus] Poblicius D[ecimi] l[ibertus] Antio[cus] :Ti[berius] Barbius Q[uinti] P[ublii] l[ibertus] Tiber[inus or -ianus] :(A[ulus] Poblicus Antio[chus], fr[eedman] of D[ecimus]; Ti[berius] Barbius Tiber[inus or ianus], fr[eedman] of Q[uintus] P[ublius].) This is the dedication of two freedmen, who were probably active in the City on the Magdalensberg as merchants. A gilt round shield found together with the Youth, which is now lost, bore this inscription: :M. Gallicinus Vindili f[ilius] L[ucius] Barb[ius] L[ucii] l[ibertus] Philoterus pr[ocurator] / Craxsantus / Barbi[i] P[ublii] s[ervus]. :(M[arcus] Gallicinus, son of Vindilus; L[ucius] Barb[ius] Philoterus, fr[eedman] of L[ucius]; Craxsantus, s[lave] of Barbi[us] P[ublius]) The donors of the shield, therefore were a free Celt, a freedman of the North Italian Gens Barbia and local Celtic slave of the same family. One of the two donors of the Youth itself was also from this family.  Significance  An identification as the image of a god cannot be made on the basis of the statue itself or the inscription. Therefore, there are a variety of interpretations. These range from athlete, through torchbearer (Lychnophoros), to various divinites. The round shield offers no further help. Recent interpretations see the statue as the cult statue of a Celtic Mars from the sanctuary on the mountaintop, or as a priest of Noreia, or as part of a statue group dedicated to Noreia, or as a statue of Mercury which stood in the town's forum.  Classification  The statue is an eclectic work of Roman idealised sculpture and was made in the first half of the first century BC. Its model was the Greek sculptures of the fifth and fourth centuries BC. Probably it is a copy of a work from the school of Polykleitos.Otto H. Urban: Der lange Weg zur Geschichte. Die Urgeschichte Österreichs. (= Österreichische Geschichte bis 15. v. Chr.). Ueberreuter Verlag, Wien 2003, p. 364,  Provenance  The statue was found in 1502 by a farmer beside the river on a terrace south of the mountaintop. It came into the possession of Matthäus Lang von Wellenburg, the Bishop of Gurk and a humanist soon afterward. He took it with him to Salzburg in 1519 when he became Archbishop of Salzburg. Until the 1980s it was assumed that the statue had come from Salzburg to Vienna in 1806 following the Peace of Pressburg. However, investigations of the casting technique and scientific analysis of the metal in 1986 led to the realisation that the statue in Vienna is a cast made in the sixteenth century. The fate of the original is not known with certainty. As documents of the Salzburg cathedral chapter reveal, it came into the possession of Emperor Ferdinand I in 1551, after which a cast had been made, which remained in Salzburg and came to Vienna in 1806. The original was moved to Spain, where it is attested in the gardens of the Royal Palace of Aranjuez in 1662 and 1786. From the beginning of the nineteenth century, the location of the original statue is unknown. Two illustrations of the original are known. The first comes from Peter Apian and Bartholemew Amand's Inscriptiones Sacrosanctae Vetustatis of 1534, the other from a fresco of Hans Bocksberger der Ältere in the chapel aisle of the Landshut Residence from 1542.

It replaced Family Income Supplement. The benefit was designed for families with children where at least one person is working more than 24 hours a week, on average. This represented an exclusion with entitlement to Income Support. The work should be intended to last at least five weeks. Calculation These figures are using the rates current in 1997. There was a maximum credit for each family. To calculate it take one adult credit (it doesn’t matter whether there are one or two adults) of £47.65, plus an amount for each child: Under 11 £12.05 11-15 £19.95 16 or 17 £24.80 18 £34.70 If the family’s net income, not including Child Benefit, Maternity Allowance or One Parent Benefit is £77.15 or less than they got the maximum. Income was calculated using the same principles as for Housing Benefit, but without a disregard for earnings. Up to £60 was deductible for the cost of childcare providing neither claimant nor partner can care for the children while working. If income is higher than this then deduct 70% of the difference from the maximum to work out entitlement. Add an extra £10.55 if the claimant works for 30 or more hours a week. The benefit was paid by an order book, which will lasted for six months, no matter how circumstances change, unless someone else claims benefit for one of the children. If desired the money could be paid directly into a bank account. If the claimant had capital of more than £8000 they couldn't get Family Credit. Capital of between £3000 and £8000 reduced benefit. If a child had capital of more than £3000 it was excluded from the calculation, but didn’t affect benefit otherwise. In two parent families the woman was expected to claim. The claimant had to be actually working when they claim. Five weekly, or two monthly pay slips, or a statement from the employer were required. Self- employed people had to provide accounts or estimates of earnings. Claimants were required to be present and “ordinarily resident” in Great Britain when they claim. The remunerative work had all to be in Great Britain. Effect on other benefits The amount paid through Family Creit was taken into account in full for calculating Income Support, Council Tax Rebate and Housing Benefit payments. People who got Family Credit were also passported to the NHS Low Income Scheme, cheap dried milk for babies, travel to hospital for treatment, and possible Social Fund grants for babies or funerals. Poverty Trap: A person who got Family Credit and paid Income Tax as well would not see more than 19p a week for each £1 a week pay rise. If they got Housing Benefit as well they could be on a marginal tax rate of 96%.

Towards the end of her service she was transferred to the Harwich - Dunkerque route. 19 March 1982. Retrieved 1 January 2014 Essex Ferry was withdrawn from service in 1981 and laid up at Harwich. In 1983, Essex Ferry was sold to Medway Secondary Metals for breaking, departing under tow for Rainham, Kent on 27 April 1983 and arriving two days later. She was initially reduced to deck level and renamed Essex Ferry Pontoon. She was used in the salvage of the Norwegian semi-submersible drilling rig which had capsized in March 1980. Following this work, she was scrapped.

The Mitcheldean Road and Forest of Dean Junction Railway was an independent railway company incorporated in 1871, to provide a northerly outlet for iron ore and coal products from the Cinderford and Whimsey area in the Forest of Dean, to the Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway line; mineral traffic to industrial centres in South Wales and the Midlands was foreseen. The company ran out of money during construction, and the Great Western Railway purchased it and completed the line about 1882. By then the intended mineral flows were being adequately handled on other routes, and the GWR did not open the line to traffic, although in 1885 a short length at the southern end was opened to connect mineral workings. The line remained dormant until in 1907 the Great Western Railway introduced a service of railmotor passenger trains, opening several low-cost stopping places on the line as far north as Drybrook Halt. The service was successful at first but declined later, closing in 1930. Ammunition was stored in the disused tunnel on the line during World War II, but later use was confined to a bitumen plant near Whimsey, and the line closed completely in 1967. Background System map of the former Mitcheldean Road and Forest of Dean Railway in 1908The considerable iron and coal wealth of the Forest of Dean, coupled with exceptionally poor road facilities, had encouraged the promotion of tramways to convey the heavy minerals to market. At first this was locally focussed, and then conveyance to waterway transport became important. In the early 1840s the Great Western Railway was sponsoring the Monmouth and Hereford Railway, to build a line from Standish, south-east of Gloucester, to Hereford via Ross-on-Wye, with a southward branch line from Lea, near Mitcheldean, to Whimsey, near Cinderford. At the time Whimsey was an important centre of the mineral extraction industry in the Forest of Dean. The Monmouth and Hereford Railway was incorporated in 1845, but limited in scope by Parliament, and the powers were not exercised. However, in 1851 the Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway received its authorising Act of Parliament, and it opened a line on a similar alignment from Hereford to Grange Court on 1 June 1855. The GWR itself built the connecting section from Grange Court to Gloucester, and the South Wales Railway opened its line progressively from Grange Court to Chepstow. The South Wales Railway took over the Forest of Dean Railway, successor to the Bullo Pill Railway, which had been built as a tramway. The South Wales Railway converted part of the FoDR network to a broad gauge railway branch, and this was completed to Whimsey in 1854. It was realised that Whimsey was close to the Mitcheldean Road station of the Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway, and a branch connection would give a useful northward and westward outlet to South Wales industrial sites and to the West Midlands for the minerals of Whimsey, and on 29 November 1856 details were published of a proposed Forest of Dean Central, Lydbrook & Hereford, Ross & Gloucester Junction Railway. This was to extend the Forest of Dean Central Railway northwards to Mitcheldean Road and later to Ledbury; but in fact nothing came of the idea. A viable scheme at last The plan was dormant for several years until 1870 when a bill was deposited in for the \\"Mitcheldean Road and Whimsey Railway\\". The terrain was extremely difficult, and the line would climb from Mitcheldean Road at 1 in 30 and 1 in 34 to a summit near Drybrook, and then descend at 1 in 40 towards Whimsey. At first the line was opposed by the Great Western Railway and the Severn and Wye Railway, both of which regarded it as a threat to their traffic. On 22 May 1871 a meeting was held at Paddington between GWR directors, an S&WR; deputation and Alfred and Thomas Goold, representing the Mitcheldean Road concern. The Goolds claimed that the line was necessary for the development of the iron ore at Drybrook, Westbury Brook and Wigpool, and said that if the S&WR; had given any assurance that it would be constructing its Lydbrook Valley line in the near future, the bill would never have been promoted. The GWR offered to accommodate the traffic and to reimburse the expenses of the bill, but the promoters declined. The GWR then declared its implacable opposition to the scheme, but a select committee of the House of Lords gave the GWR and S&WR; short shrift, finding that they had no proper grounds for opposition, and the Bill went forward smoothly. The name of the incorporated company was changed slightly, and the Mitcheldean Road & Forest of Dean Junction Railway Act was passed on 13 July 1871. The company had powers to build a railway 4 miles 5 furlongs in length from Mitcheldean Road station to the Forest of Dean Railway branch at Whimsey. The capital was £30,000 in £10 shares, and there were borrowing powers for £10,000. The GWR was authorised to subscribe up to half the capital. Five years were allowed for completion of the line; there was no mention of carrying passengers. The engineer's estimate for construction was £28,268, no stations being envisaged. The company was authorised to enter into agreements with the GWR for working and maintaining the line. By the time of the Act, the Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway line was standard gauge but the Forest of Dean Railway branch was still broad gauge, giving the Mitcheldean Road company a significant, but temporary, commercial advantage, in that onward transit of loaded wagons did not require transshipment. Construction difficulties The first ordinary meeting of the company on 13 January 1872 was abortive as only the Goolds were present and there was no quorum, so that no business could be transacted. At a shareholders’ meeting on 8 May it was decided to ask the GWR to work the line for 55% instead of the agreed 60% of the receipts, if the ruling gradient was reduced by substituting a tunnel at the summit for the cutting originally proposed. A ruling gradient of 1 in 35 was now to be achieved, by construction of a 638-yard Euroclydon tunnel, as well as another tunnel 97 yards in length and a very deep cutting at Drybrook.The business calculation was therefore that a moderately long tunnel would be paid for by a 5% margin on forward expenses. At a meeting on 6 June 1873 the proposed working agreement with the GWR was adopted. The tender for construction of the line by Miller & Roberts in the sum of £30,000 was accepted. G Wells Owen was the company's engineer. Construction began in 1874 and in May the secretary, Thomas Goold, and Alfred Goold, having walked over the line, suggested that the tunnel should be lengthened and a deviation made at Drybrook. This was agreed, and Crown sanction was received for the changes on 2 July 1874. Relations between the company and the contractor were unhappy, and there were complaints about slow progress and counter-claims about obstruction. The company engineer's assistant Coulthard had \\"ordered the North heading of the tunnel to be stopped in consequence of an error in his engineering by which the tunnel had been driven out of its proper course past the No. 1 shaft without touching it\\". The outcome of all this was the contractor's abandonment of the work. The company took over the work, and on 10 December Coulthard reported that a shaft, abandoned because the contractor could not complete its sinking, had been finished by him within three days and had struck the tunnel only 3 inches out of line instead of 7 feet off as the contractor had forecast. By 29 February 1876 considerable progress had been made and work was expected to be finished by July or August. This proved considerably optimistic, but in August 1876 it was reported that \\"The Mitcheldean Road and Whimsey Railroad is so far progressing that it is expected that the line will be completed by December next, when it is proposed to open it; it is intended to carry passengers as well as mineral traffic\\". This forecast too proved unreliable, and on 20 July 1877 the directors decided to dispense with Coulthard's services, as he had misled them as to the time of completion and cost. W G Owen estimated that well over £5,000 was needed to complete the line. A new contractor, Griffiths of Lydney was approached to take over the work, but he declined. A Mr Harris then took over supervision of the works but, owing to some misunderstanding, dismissed all the workmen so that work had stopped entirely by mid-September except in the tunnel. On 9 October 1877 W G Owen reported that £12,000 would still be required to complete it. Taken over by the Great Western Railway By now the £10,000 from the GWR had been swallowed up, with little to show for it, and the GWR demanded an inspection of the accounts. On 18 October, Hadingham, the company clerk, travelled to London with the books, and GWR officials began to reaudit the accounts. When they wrote to Thomas Goold for various documents and bills to help them in their task he decided to call a halt. He pointed out that the GWR had two seats on the board, but that their nominees had never attended a meeting, and if they were to allow the GWR to audit their accounts they might have to extend the same facility to all other shareholders. Nevertheless, the company itself was incapable of progressing the construction, and by early 1878 the GWR had made traffic and working agreements with the company, and the GWR Act of 22 July 1878 enabled the GWR to subscribe a further £20,000 to the undertaking. Daniel Gooch of the GWR became the company chairman and board meetings were held at Paddington instead of at Newnham. Still the line lay moribund for some two years until the GWR took over completely. An Act of 6 August 1880 authorised the GWR to absorb the undertaking and to complete the line, which it did at a further cost of £21,626, making a total cost to the GWR of £60,626. Still with the line completed, the GWR made no attempt to open it to traffic: economic depression dominated the Forest economy; moreover the completion of the S&WR; Lydbrook extension provided a much more direct outlet for traffic from the northern part of the Forest to South Wales. By now the GWR was well established in the southern and eastern part of the Forest, and a northern outlet was less important. Workings in the southern part of the originally planned route could conveniently be given a southerly connection, and about a mile at that end was opened for mineral traffic in July 1885, from Speedwell Siding down to Whimsey. Passenger trains at the southern end In 1906 the Great Western Railway had achieved much success in introducing rail-motors, sometimes known as auto-trains, on existing lines. The system was to provide low-cost stopping places at hitherto unserved points on existing lines. The railmotors were either a combined passenger carriage and small integrated steam engine power unit, or later, a small separate locomotive. In either case control of the engine from the remote end of the vehicle was possible, avoiding the necessity of running round the train at terminals. The population of the more remote areas around Drybrook, families of miners mostly, agitated for such a service on their mineral line: > The success of rail motor services on many hitherto unremunerative branch > lines has brought to the front the possibility of re-opening abandoned lines > to be worked on the new method. The Great Western Railway have been asked to > establish a motor service on the Whimsey branch, between Mitcheldean Road > and Cinderford. The Whimsey line was constructed some years ago by a > company, which, finding they had not enough capital to work it successfully, > sold it to the Great Western Railway in expectation that they would work it, > but they decided to keep it closed. The Great Western Railway have replied > to the petitioners that they are afraid that the possibility of getting a > reasonable return for such service is not such as would justify the heavy > capital expense that would be involved, and as the population served only > numbers about 9,000, the caution of the railway in the matter appears > perfectly justifiable. In fact in 1907 the system was introduced on the old Bullo Pill line from Newnham and on the lower part of the Whimsey line as far as Steam Mills Crossing on 3 August 1907. 20,824 passengers were carried in the first six weeks, including 3,319 on the August Bank Holiday. A further 41 chains of the Mitcheldean Road route was opened on 4 November 1907, from Speedwell to Drybrook. The GWR had been asked to establish a passenger service between Mitcheldean Road and Cinderford, over the whole of the Mitcheldean Road route, but the GWR saw that the financial return would not justify the heavy capital expense as the population to be served was very limited. The 1922 Bradshaw public timetable shows \\"Auto-cars -- one class only\\" between Newnham and Drybrook Halt. There are departures at 08:25, 11:30, 14:40 (not continuing beyond Cinderford except on Saturdays), 17:36, 19:50 (not continuing beyond Cinderford on Thursdays and Saturday), and 21:18 (Thursdays and Saturdays only). Intermediate stations between Newnham and Drybrook Halt were Cinderford and Whimsey Halt, and there were halts at Steam Mills Crossing and Nailbridge between Whimsey and Drybrook. There was no direct route from Cinderford station northwards, and the northbound trains must have run to Bilson Junction (that is, towards Newnham), reversing there to continue northwards. The publicly advertised journey time from Cinderford to Whimsey Halt was 8 minutes; the distance is less than a mile. The passenger service from Cinderford to Drybrook was withdrawn from 7 July 1930. Abandonment of the north end The running track had been laid throughout the route to Mitcheldean Road, and was maintained for many years by the GWR. At Mitcheldean Road the line terminated in the goods yard; to enter it from the station required two reversals and the short terminal neck would have prevented a long train from using the line, as well as precluding any possibility of a run at the 1 in 38 bank. The rails between Drybrook Quarry and Mitcheldean Road were taken up between 8 and 17 February 1917, in common with those on many disused and lightly used branches, the track being in demand in France during World War I. During World War II, Euroclydon tunnel (so named by Paar; Cooke calls it Drybrook Tunnel; Maggs calls it Hawthorns Tunnel) was used by the Admiralty for storing ammunition. An ammunition train was sent to the location by the Admiralty without prior arrangement with the GWR; the GWR informed the Admiralty that the track into the tunnel was not usable, and proper arrangements had to be made hastily. In due course narrow gauge track was laid from what became Admiralty Siding into the tunnel. Daily train movements took place for a time. The ammunition usage ceased after the cessation of hostilities; in 1957 the tunnel was used briefly for the cultivation of mushrooms. In 1959 Berry Wiggins established a bitumen plant at Whimsey, immediately south of Steam Mills Crossing. Bitumen was loaded away from the depot. The last such consignment was on 1 May 1967 and the stub of the branch closed on 1 August 1967. Description of the route Writing originally in 1965, Paar said \\"The whole route can still be followed. Beginning in Mitcheldean Road station yard the line immediately began to climb at 1 in 38, curving south-west and crossing two lanes, the first by an underbridge and the second on the level. It continued to climb along a wooded hillside, crossed over a track by a wooden bridge now dismantled, and under a road by a stone arch bridge. After just over two miles the line entered Euroclydon tunnel, which took its name from Euroclydon House on the hill above. The steep gradient continued through the tunnel to the summit where, in 2 miles, the line had climbed 321 feet. Thence it fell at 1 in 42 and 1 in 54 through the short Drybrook tunnel, and continued south to Whimsey where it made an end-on junction with the Forest of Dean Branch.\\" Paar described the line from Whimsey to Drybrook in the reverse direction: Whimsey was the terminus of the branch (from Bullo Pill) from 1854 until the Mitcheldean Road line was built. After lying unused for some years, the section from Whimsey to Speedwell sidings was opened by the GWR in July 1885. Steam Mills halt was on the up side beyond a level crossing, after which came a shallow embankment, a bridge across the tramroad, an unusual joint bridge taking the Trafalgar tramway and the railway under a road, a skew girder bridge across the tramway, and Nailbridge halt (up side). Immediately beyond the halt was a bridge carrying the Drybrook road, followed by Speedwell siding, a loop to the running line, serving the Speedwell Newbridge level. Though officially closed in 1897, activity continued thereafter and the siding connections were not finally taken out of use until 6 January 1938. Subsequently, the product of quarry operations was the commercial traffic of the line. After the Second World War rail traffic to and from the quarries dwindled, and ceased in February 1953. The line was severed north of Whimsey as there was no other traffic. Early in 1957 track lifting was completed from Drybrook to Steam Mills. In 1924, the development of Harrow Hill colliery, on the up side, led to the provision of two new sidings, with connections at both ends. North of Speedwell, the Mitcheldean line remained out of use until opened in 1907 for rail-motor services to Drybrook halt (up side), preceding which bridges carried the line over the Trafalgar tramway and a lane. Yet a further mile fragment of the line was opened as late as 18 October 1928, from Drybrook halt to Drybrook quarries. Two over-bridges and a short tunnel were traversed on this section, and as the gradient fell towards Bilson at 1 in 46, catch-points were provided north of the halt to protect the auto-train from runaways. At the quarries, two sidings were provided on the down side, looped to the running line.

He had no links with the constituency but his candidacy was officially endorsed by both the Unionist and Labour parties, due to the wartime electoral truce. Campaign The campaign took place against a national backdrop of a war that was not going well for Britain. The Coalition Government led by H. H. Asquith was being criticised by the Northcliffe Press. Its newspapers got behind the Independent candidate Tommy Bowles who campaigned on the issue of married men who had attested under the Derby Scheme. Advertising hoardings in the constituency were bought up by Northcliffe and carried slogans like \\"Buy the Daily Mail and vote for Bowles\\". A special pro-Bowles local edition of the Daily Mirror was produced and delivered free to homes in the constituency. Although the local Unionist association formally supported Harris, in line with the national all-party agreement, a number of local Unionists chose to support and actively campaign for Bowles. Result Despite the activities of the Northcliffe papers and local Unionists, the Liberals held the seat with an increased share of the vote. Aftermath In 1918, Harris's Unionist opponent was endorsed by the Coalition Government and gained the seat.

The army was formed by Moulay Ismail out of Berber tribesmen from the eastern Rif. Their rise coincided with the formation of the Black Guard, also by Moulay Ismail. They came to play an important role in the 17th century Moroccan wars against Spanish colonization. Cities like Tangier, Ksar el- Kebir, Mehdya, Asilah were reconquered by the Jaysh al-Rifi. One of its generals was Ahmad al-Rifi, a native of Temsamane, who became governor of Tangier, Asilah and Tetouan. His descendants, the Hamami al-Rifi family, would govern these towns, and most of the Gharb, with a large degree of autonomy until 1912. Background The Moroccan ruling Alaouite dynasty had no strong tribal base, as their legitimacy was based on them being descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, not on a particular ethnic or tribal nationalism. This meant that they had to incorporate a diverse range of tribes across Morocco, given that their original base was not particularly strong. In the earliest years of Alaouite rule the state relied on Arab bedouin tribes from Morocco's deep south, as well as Arabs and Zenata recruited from the Atlantic plains. Berber tribes from the Sous as well as those from the southern river valleys were also incorporated. These different components were not always reliable though, often rebelling and showing no particular allegiance to the state. In the late 17th century, the famous Moroccan sultan Moulay Ismail created a new elite army, consisting of over 100,000 black African slaves. This Black Guard would come to dominate the Alaouite military and overall politics. Besides this strong standing army, the sultan made use of the jaysh. These consisted of soldiery recruited from tribal groups. These jaysh' were decentralized, and leadership was often tribal in nature. In the south en center of the country, these jaysh' were formed from rural Arabs, as well as Berber tribes of the plains of the Middle Atlas and the High Atlas. In the north, Berber Riffian jaysh came to dominate, with Riffian armies used against the Spanish-governed cities on the Moroccan coast. Riffian jaysh' came to be stationed across northern Morocco, from Tangiers to the Moulouya river. To strengthen his hold on the north-west, Ismail had appointed a general of the Jaysh to the position of governor of Tangier and its outskirts. Pashas of Tangiers With the death of Moulay Ismail, the Black Army generals became the effective rulers of the state. Unlike Ismail, the new sultans were weak and incompetent, with different groups supporting different princes. In the north, the Jaysh al-Rifi generals consolidated their power and successfully fought an attempt by the Black Army to weaken their hold on Tangiers, which led to a situation where Tangiers (and neighbouring cities like Tetouan and Ksar el-Kebir) became virtually autonomous under Riffian governors. Even though these Riffians had led the struggle against British Tangiers in 1680s, from the late 1690s onwards the Hamamis developed strong economic and diplomatic ties to British Gibraltar. In the 1740s, the family broke out in rebellion against the sultan, but they were decisively beaten in battle. By that time the family had such a strong power base in the north-west, that the Makhzen was forced to appoint another member of the family to the position of governor. The last of these Riffian gouvernors of Tangier, a descendant of Ahmad al-Rifi, was deposed in 1912. References * James Brown (2001).

Grade II listed, it was constructed as part of the Bristol Harbour Railway, and now carries a guided busway and a local access cycle path. Background The Great Western Railway (GWR) was a business proposal by Isambard Kingdom Brunel to shorten the travel time between London and the new world of North America, accessed via New York City. Able to gain finance from the City of Bristol, the first Act of Parliament allowed for the construction of the GWR from London to Bristol via Reading, Swindon and Bath, Somerset. The original Bristol Harbour Railway (BHR) was a joint venture by the GWR and sister company the Bristol and Exeter Railway. It opened in 1872 between and the Floating Harbour. Its route included a tunnel under St Mary Redcliffe church, and a steam-powered bascule bridge over the entrance locks at Bathurst Basin. In 1876 the railway was extended by west to Wapping Wharf. Construction By Act of Parliament of 1897, the GWR was authorised to make an eastwards connection between the BHR and the Portishead Railway, and then create the West Loop at which would face south towards and . This connection would allow a doubling of BHR rail access capacity to the Great Western main line.E T MacDermot, The Great Western Railway, volume 2, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1931 In 1905, it was proposed to undertake the authorised extension of the BHR from Wapping Wharf across Spike Island. It would then junction into two branches: a western branch to Wapping via a line alongside the New Cut; and to Canons Marsh on the northside of the River Avon, which would then merge with the Portishead Railway (Butterfly Junction). Under a joint agreement, Bristol Corporation and the GWR engaged as their Chief Engineer J.C. lnglis. The building contractor was John Lysaght and Co., while Armstrong Whitworth were engaged to design the hydraulic movement system. Construction of the span-bridge started in 1905, with two squared rock-faced limestone piers, the southern one of which would pivot the swinging span. This supported a moveable Whipple Murphy truss span, weighing , with total metal work of the entire bridge weighing in at . With the bridge able to operate both ways, each opening/closing cycle consumed of water from the Floating Harbour. The bridge control cabin, road and railway signal boxes, and the reversible hydraulic motor were all housed in a single structure perched on stilts above the upper road deck. The original estimate for the bridge was £36,500, with the GWR agreeing to pay half. The final cost was £70,389, to which Bristol Corporation asked the GWR to increase its contribution. After further negotiation the GWR contributed £22,000. Operations Designed and opened as the freight-only Wapping Wharf Branch, the bridge was opened on 3 October 1906 by the Lady Mayoress, Mrs A.J.Smith. With both railway and road operations and bridge maintenance undertaken by the GWR, it opened on average ten times a day until February 1934. The controlling railway signals were interlocked with the signal boxes on either side of the river, making it impossible for signals to be cleared unless the bridge span was locked in the closed position. =Decommissioning= Bristol Corporation rescinded the GWR's obligation to maintain the swing apparatus in 1951, after which it was welded shut. After the completion of a new A370 road dual carriageway system in the docks area, and the opening of the replacement Plimsoll Bridge to the west in 1965, the road deck and signal cabin were removed. View across the rail trail section of the bridge The BHR's connection with Temple Meads was closed and the track lifted in 1964, and the Canons Marsh branch closed the following year. The Western Fuel Company continued to use the line from the Portishead branch over the swing bridge and Wapping marshalling yard for commercial coal traffic. The rail line over the bridge was singled in 1976, and shut operationally after Western Fuel ceased railway operations in 1987. The bridge was revisited by GWR Pannier Tank No.1369 in 1996, prior to the re-opening of the residual BHR as a visitor attraction. Present Bristol (UK) M2 Metrobus enters Ashton Avenue Bridge from south, 27 Dec 2018Grade II listed in May 2000, The single track rail line remained in place over the bridge, but was highly overgrown. Network Rail later lifted the track from the bridge to . The other side of the railway level has been converted into rail trail foot and cycle path, part of the Pill pathway. It is listed on the Heritage at Risk Register. In 2015 it was announced that the bridge would close for a period of 12 months from the autumn for a complete renovation in connection with the MetroBus project. The bridge now carries a separate single bus lane and a wider cycle and pedestrian path.

The parents who have lost their only child are known as shidu fumu (), or simply as shidu parents or shiduers. Impact=Trends= As a result of the one- child policy, the number of shidu parents is expected to increase in China over the coming years. According to official figures, there have been at least one million families who lost their only child since the implementation of the one-child policy to the end of 2010 and it is expected to rise with 76,000 per year. =Issues= In a society where parents rely on their children for looking after them in old age, this phenomenon may have devastating effects to many shidu parents. Many shidu parents suffer from psychological problems and financial difficulties after losing their only child. In 2013, the China National Committee on Ageing reported that between 70 and 80 percent of shidu parents have suffered psychological trauma, in which half of these people are also experiencing depression. Comparing bereaved parents and nonbereaved parents, it is observed that bereaved parents are significantly more vulnerable in physical well-being (in terms of chronic diseases and health status self-assessment) and psychological well-being (in terms of depression and satisfaction with life). Furthermore, bereaved parents tend to have less social support (in terms of practical support, emotional support, and social interaction). This is consistent with the reported social isolation of these parents, driven by both withdrawal and exclusion from society. Looking at the characteristics of bereaved parents, it's been observed that parents of a younger age, lower education level, and lower income level, and with chronic diseases are significantly more vulnerable in terms of well-being. Investigating shidu in mainland China, with reduced family members due to population control, there are indications that the death of a loved one has become more devastating and traumatic for other family members as well. Investigating shidu parents (with parents of a living child as control) in the Yangpu district of Shanghai, research show that shidu parents have an increased vulnerability for PTSD, depressive symptoms, and mental illness symptoms. Compared to males, females were especially susceptible to develop PTSD. In shidu parents, a significantly higher overall morbidity of coronary heart disease, tumors, mental diseases, and other unclassified diseases was also observed. Shidu parents also had more visits to the hospital. Government policies=Programs= In 2002, the National People's Congress put into law that local governments must \\"provide necessary assistance\\" to shidu parents if they do not adopt or give birth to another child. In 2007, the central government set a monthly compensation of minimum $16 per parent in ten provinces and cities. On 31 August 2007, National Population and Family Planning Commission (NPFPC) and the Ministry of Finance stated that the national compensation level is 100 yuan or above per person per month. Since a 2012 policy, families were entitled to a monthly compensation of minimum 135 yuan ($22) per parent. On 26 December 2013, the NHFPC increased the monthly compensation to a minimum of 340 yuan ($56) per parent for urban households and to a minimum of 170 yuan ($28) per parent for rural households, applicable if the woman is at least 49 years old. The actual amount of compensation may increase depending on provincial and local policies. =Criticism= The governmental financial assistance has been characterized as relatively low. Furthermore, the program's strict focus on providing structural support (such as cash allowances and prioritized access to nursing homes) has been criticized, because it heavily lacks on issues that goes beyond structural support (such as psychological well-being and social support). Secondly, the structural interventions itself are considered inadequate, because there's a strong emphasis attached to filial obligation in old-age security and well- being in Chinese society, and nursing homes are inadequate in coverage and quality. Professor Qiao Xiaochun (of the Population Research Centre at Peking University and former consultant for the Family Planning Committee) states that government assistance remains very poor, as the government did not fully expect all the possible consequences of the one-child policy at the very beginning, such as the problems associated with shidu parents. He also notes that the psychological issues are more pressing than poverty for most shidu parents. Public response Notable people, such as Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Mo Yan, have spoken out for more support to those who have lost their only child. On 5 June 2012, around 80 shidu fumu (on behalf of 2000 shidu fumu who had signed a petition) assembled at the National Population and Family Planning Commission (NPFPC) and proposed the provision of economic compensation for their loss, the establishment of shidu fumu-oriented communities with low rent, and the designation of a department where shidu fumu can turn to for help when needed. There was no formal reply for almost two years. On 21 April 2014, over 240 shidu fumu assembled at the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC; having superseded the NPFPC in 2013) for an official discussion. Even though the NHFPC acknowledged their contributions to the family planning policies, they refused their request as they stated that there is no legal basis to support their requirement for administrative compensation. Incidents like the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Boston Marathon bombings or the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappearance have highlighted the tremendous impact that this phenomenon has. In May 2010, the 60-year-old shidu parent Sheng Hailin became China's oldest person to give birth, namely to twin girls through IVF. She said that it helped her out of the despair after her daughter's death, but she also raised concerns about her health and other obstacles with raising the twins.

Her mother was the second wife of Hokusai. Ōi was an accomplished painter who also worked as a production assistant to her father. Biography Ōi's birth and death dates are not known. She was a daughter of the ukiyo-e artist Katsushika Hokusai (1760—1849). Hokusai was married twice; the first marriage produced a son and two daughters, and the second, to a woman named Koto (), resulted in a son and one or two daughters. It is said that Ōi was born in Hokusai's 37th year: Kansei 12 (). Ōi married the artist Minamisawa Tōmei in . They did not get along, and she found him a comically poor artist. They divorced about 1827; she returned to her father's home and never remarried. Ōi thereafter assisted Hokusai in his artwork and took to producing her own. Of her bijin-ga portraits of beauties Hokusai is said to have told people, \\"The bijin-ga I paint myself are no match for Oei's.\\" Ōi's mother died in . Ōi's whereabouts and status become unknown within a few years of her father's death in 1849. Ōi not only shared the artistic talent of her father, but also his characteristic of a free spirit. Both of them did not care about material wealth and keeping up with housework. Ōi and her father painted all day, and as neither one cooked they would go to a nearby market and buy prepared food. After a while when it became too unsuitable to live, they would go and find another place to live. Of the testimony that remains about Ōi, Tsuyuki Iitsu, a pupil of Hokusai's in the master's later years, described her as having an eccentric personality like her father and a charitable disposition—she had ambitions to become a female xian sage.

If you saw it in a second-hand goods shop you > wouldn't give 5/- for it. Yet it represents the ambition and the dreams of > every football club in Group 9, where Rugby League is a religion, and the > Maher Cup its idol. Weekly tens of thousands follow the grim battles that > are waged for its possession. Interest in the matches is State-wide, but in > the South, even the kindergarten kids are gripped with its mysterious > fascination. ''  Introduction  Matches were usually rugged affairs with protests and disputes common. Games were played during floods, snow and other adverse weather conditions. Gambling was an essential element of Maher Cup culture. The winning team would have the right to contest all subsequent challenges on their home ground and (in the early years) would retain the gate takings. When the Cup was newly captured celebrations would normally commence as the team returned home. In the 1920s and 1930s these trips were usually by special train, returning with horn sounding, and carriages full of noisy supporters. Typically the town band would leading a cavalcade of revellers carrying the cup and players to an impromptu civic reception. Often hastily organised entertainments, such as dances, followed late into the evening. Substantial financial gifts may be placed in the Cup for the benefit of these local heroes To be a Maher Cup player was to be somebody of note in the community. About 15 to 20 challenges were usually played each year, the peak being 24 in 1953. Initially games were on Wednesday afternoons, changing in 1946 to Saturdays. From then on teams would back up, often with little enthusiasm for Sunday regular competition games. Interest in Maher Cup football probably peaked in the early 1950s, falling away quickly in the mid-1960s. The Maher Cup produced colourful stories - such as the Cup being placed in jail for its safekeeping, being stolen, vandalised and dumped. There were stories of referees being bribed, knocked out, attacked by women, and refusing to adjudicate due to general player mayhem. Games were often extremely violent with injuries and dismissals routine. Pitch invasions were a perpetual problem for officials. There were claims of teams being unfairly stacked with short-term imports, footballers bribed to lose, and even \\"ring-ins\\". Games were played on \\"ploughed paddocks\\" infested with rabbits, in heavy snow, and on grounds covered with six inches of water. At Gundagai in 1952 thousands of spectators needed to be rescued from rising Murrumbidgee floodwaters. Also in Gundagai, nuns needed to fight a house blaze due to the brigade, as well as almost everyone else in town, attending the Maher Cup. Passionate Maher Cup poetry, penned by supporters, was printed in local newspapers, songs composed and fiction published. It was recorded on film by Karl Bounarder of Gundagai as early as 1923. Local newspapers swept up feelings of injustice and foul play. Radio station 2LF of Young broadcast games live into rural homes from 1938. The railways made good profits from supporters crammed into special trains for a day (and night) out.  History  The Maher Cup was donated by Edward John (Ted) Maher in May 1920 to the Tumut Rugby Union. Maher had just arrived in Tumut, from Young, as the new licensee of the Wynyard Hotel. The Cup was rather plain and looked as though it should have a lid. It became known as 'The Old Tin Pot'. Although only Tumut and Gundagai competed in the first two years, it was an instant success. After just three challenges under union rules, it was decided to change to rugby league, a newer, faster, more entertaining form of the game which had swept through the region from 1910. By 1922 crowds of 3,000 were common. In 1923 rugby league was formally organised in the region with 'Group 9' being established at a meeting at the Grand Hotel, Harden. Group 9 towns became synonymous with Maher Cup towns. As well as the winning club taking all the proceeds from the gate, the spending spectators contributed to the prosperity of local pubs, cafes and other businesses. Labourers, tradesmen, shop-owners, clerks, farmers and farm workers all took pride in a successful team. Cootamundra became the first club to maximise the economic value of the Cup. They signed a well known Sydney player as captain-coach, Phil Regan from Glebe. Regan created a disciplined, fit and co-ordinated team which featured talented locals such as Eric Weissel, Bill Lesberg, and Jack Kingston. It was not designed to be a perpetual cup and 'Coota' fulfilled the conditions to win the Cup outright by end of the 1923 season. However, it had become so popular and valuable that Cootamundra put it back into play, but with new rules designed to favour the Cootamundra team, including rights to the first and last challenges of each year and control of disputes and the challenge draws. The Cup remained popular during the Great Depression. Although crowds declined, protests increased in frequency and mendacity. Many clubs made considerable investments building teams of professional imports, with mixed results. In 1932 and 1935 Cootamundra invested heavily in imports. When they failed to wrest the \\"Win, Tug and Wrangle Cup\\" back to Fisher Park they were all sacked. Tumut bucked the trend in 1935 producing one of the most successful Maher Cup teams of all time, composed solely of young unpaid locals. In the late thirties Tumut, Temora, Young and Cowra dominated the competition. Across New South Wales in the 1920s and 1930s teams played for a number of local and regional challenge cups. Southwest examples include the Alley and Prowse, Bancroft, Batsos, Farrar, O'Farrell, Garden of Roses, Jack Hore Memorial, Motor, Tulk and Weissel Gold cups. A successful team may hold half a dozen such cups at a time. The rise of reliable road transportation to nearby places lead to the demise of challenge cups and their replacement by regular competition schedules. The excellent rail system in the region, the large distances between towns, and the popularity of the Maher Cup, delayed the establishment of such competitions in the Southwest. When cars and buses became commonplace and roads sealed, people became less dependent on rail and regular competitions easier to arrange. Although permanent competition football was established in 1938 it still played second fiddle to the Maher Cup until the 1960s. Play went into recess from 1942 to 1944, seemingly due to economic reasons rather than wartime sacrifice. Petrol rationing, loss of players to the forces, and less promotion of sport in local newspapers, resulted in poor gates. Recommencing in June 1945, Cup football maintained, and possibly exceeded its attraction into the 1950s. The Gundagai Tigers which through the influential Gundagai Independent newspaper had long pushed for the end of the Maher Cup, developed a formidable team, winning 24 matches straight from August 1951 to September 1952. This record was bettered by Harden-Murrumburrah with 29 games in a row from September 1958 to June 1960. During the 1950s many Maher Cup teams imported top ranking international footballers, often to the detriment of local talent development. Young, Cootamundra and Gundagai were particularly active importers. Rugby Union clubs, which had been completely absent from the Maher Cup towns since 1920, began to become re-established in the late 1950s, perhaps partially due to the over-professionalisation of local Rugby League. Maher Cup passion started to subside in the early 1960s due to a variety of factors, including the increasing emphasis on Group competition matches; the weakening of Group 9 with the breakaway of the Murrumbidgee Rugby League (of which Tumut, Gundagai and Junee were initiators); population drift, falling standards of play with the introduction of transfer fees; the expansion of Australian Rules football in the area and, likely, television producing greater interest in the Sydney Rugby League competition. Whereas once crack city players could be lured by Maher Cup money, the trend was now firmly in the reverse direction. The final match on 5 June 1971 at Young was won by the club to which it was originally donated - Tumut. In 2013 the 'Old Tin Pot' was polished up and placed in the NSW Rugby League Museum at Moore Park, Sydney, but in 2018 it returned to Tumut where it is housed at the Tumut Bowling and Recreation Club.  Players  Some significant Maher Cup players included: Ray Beavan (Tumut), Bill Brogan (West Wyalong), Doug Cameron (Young), Len Cooper (Barmedman & West Wyalong), Ron 'Dookie' Crowe (West Wyalong and Barmedman), Mick Crowe (Grenfell), Fred de Belin (Cootamundra), Peter Diversi (Gundagai), Cec Fifield (West Wyalong & Junee); Charles 'Chook' Fraser (Gundagai), Viv 'Bluey' Freestone (Gundagai), John Graves (Cootamundra), Abe and Sid Hall (Young), Nevyl Hand (Gundagai), John 'Bronc' Jones, (Gundagai and Tumut), Joe Jorgenson (Junee), Bill Kearney (Young), John Kelly (Temora), Jack Kingston (Cootamundra & Young), Bill Kinnane (Young & Harden), Tom Kirk, (Tumut & Barmedman), Eric Kuhn (Barmedman & Harden), Bill and Jim Lawrence (Barmedman), Bill Lesberg (Cootamunda), Bill Maizey (Cowra), Reg Maker (Temora), Herb Narvo (Cootamundra), Kevin Negus (Cowra, Cootamundra & Harden), Bernie Nevin (Harden), Peter O'Connor (Harden & Young), Col Ratcliff (West Wyalong), Phil Regan (Cootamundra), Norm 'Latchem' Robinson (Cootamundra & Tumut), Wally 'Bull' Tozer (Harden), Dick Vest (West Wyalong & Barmedman), and Eric Weissel (Cootamundra & Temora)  Clubs  729 Maher Cup matches were played.

Tennant Jr. is an American physician, writer, businessman, consultant, and former mayor of West Covina, California. Tennant has earned recognition as an expert in pain management and substance dependence and has also been involved in some controversies. Currently, the physician's focus is on researching and developing new treatment protocols for Adhesive Arachnoiditis, an incurable inflammatory condition that is one of the toughest to treat in the pain management field. Education and early career Tennant was born into a farm family in Dodge City, Kansas. He was graduated from the University of Missouri and, in 1966, the University of Kansas School of Medicine. He served in Vietnam as a Major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps and was an Army surgeon in Germany, where he first came into contact with patients with drug problems. In 1972 Tennant earned a Doctorate of Public Health at the UCLA School of Public Health of the University of California, Los Angeles. His doctoral thesis was informed by his experience treating service personnel. As a post-doctorate fellow, Tennant was appointed director of UCLA's methadone program, and was an associate professor at the school. Physician and writer Tennant specializes in pain management and drug addiction. He is a strong advocate for intractable pain patients, arguing that opioids can be safe and effective even applied over long durations, and helped push the \\"Pain Patient's Bill of Rights\\" law through the California legislature. Tennant has authored over 200 articles and books, including many to help intractable pain patients, and is editor-in-chief of the journal Practical Pain Management. Zig Ziglar described Tennant as \\"perhaps the number one drug authority in the world\\". Businesses and consultancies Tennant operates a pain management clinic, Veract Intractable Pain Clinic in West Covina, California. The clinic, opened in 1975, originally focused primarily on cancer patients and post-polio pain. Tennant has been a substance abuse consultant for the California Department of Justice, the California Highway Patrol (where he taught officers how to recognize symptoms of drug use) and hundreds of private companies, including Texaco and the Southern Pacific Railroad. He operated a drug testing and drug education consultancy, with clients including the National Football League (NFL), the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR), and the Los Angeles Dodgers. With the Dodgers, Tennant worked with players including Steve Howe, a promising left-hander whose career was ultimately derailed by substance abuse. Tennant terminated his relationship with the NFL in April 1989, and Tennant's handling of some matters while working for the NFL, particularly in the Clarence Kay case, were later criticized. Tennant was accused of being involved with reporting a false result of a drug test of NASCAR driver Tim Richmond; the resulting lawsuit was settled out of court, and NASCAR terminated its relationship with Tennant in 1990. Tennant became involved with methadone clinics in 1972 when he became director of UCLA's methadone treatment program, later creating the nonprofit Community Health Projects, Inc. which operated 29 methadone facilities in California. His clinics were repeatedly cited by California and federal authorities for serious and continuous deficiencies and on several occasions had to reimburse the state for overcharges. In March 1997, following a Drug Enforcement Administration investigation, Tennant and Community Health Projects paid $625,000 to settle allegations that many of his clinics violated record- keeping requirements. According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Lori Richardson Pelliccioni, record-keeping was so poor at the clinics that methadone supplies could not be tracked adequately. Federal prosecutors said it was the long history of uncorrected violations that forced Tennant and his chain to pay the U.S. government $625,000 and avoid a civil lawsuit. Tennant and Community Health Projects denied wrongdoing and said they were victims of federal rules that were vague, bewildering, inconsistent, unevenly enforced, and contradictory to California law, and that no clinic could withstand the special scrutiny that Community Health Projects received as the state's largest and most visible provider of methadone treatment. Tennant called for new state legislation to clarify methadone regulations. Tennant developed methods of examining eyes to detect presence of drugs in the system. His \\"rapid-eye exam\\" won praise from law enforcement authorities as an effective field drug sobriety test. A home-use version, the \\"Rapid Eye Check Kit\\", was developed by Tennant and marketed by an Irvine non-profit group as an aid for parents in detecting teen drug use. Colleges, school districts and businesses in several states adopted the test. This test drew criticism for inaccuracy (including both false positives and false negatives) and intrusiveness. In a civil rights lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the University of Colorado's student drug-testing program, which included the test, U.S. District Judge Joseph Bellipanni concluded that the test was extremely inaccurate. It was announced on March 26, 2018 that Tennant would be retiring and therefore closing his pain clinic in the Los Angeles suburb of West Covina. It has been speculated that his retirement was partly due to an ongoing DEA investigation of his opioid prescribing practices. Politics and civic involvement Tennant has been active in local Republican politics. He founded the San Gabriel Valley Chapter of the Lincoln Club, a California Republican organization. He has been active in civic charities, is the recipient of an NAACP Service Award, and was West Covina Citizen of the Year. Tennant served two terms on the West Covina, California city council in 1980–1988 and was also mayor of the city. Tennant was active in efforts to block expansion of landfills in the San Gabriel Valley and was opposed to County Supervisor Pete Schabarum's efforts to block the BKK Corporation landfill in West Covina from accepting trash from Los Angeles and clashed with Schabarum over plans to build a waste-to-energy incinerator in Irwindale. Tennant also worked to block commercial development in Frank C. Bonelli Regional Park. Tennant sponsored a bill, which became law in 1997, to make highly restricted narcotics more available to patients with severe and intractable pain. The law, which includes a \\"Pain Patient's Bill of Rights\\", requires doctors to advise patients who suffer from severe, chronic, and intractable pain that narcotics such as Percodan, Demerol and Dilaudid could be prescribed. According to Tennant and bill author Leroy Greene, doctors were failing to prescribe these drugs in the large quantities needed for severe pain relief because they feared prosecution for overprescribing a controlled substance, or because they are philosophically opposed to narcotics because they can create dependency.

Biography Born Eva Augenblick in Warsaw, came to New York at age eight with her parents and grew up in Queens and Scarsdale. Eva's family fled Nazi- occupied Warsaw in 1939, emigrated first to Brazil, and soon after to the U.S.. Her parents held academic posts in Poland which they were unable to pursue in the US, but somehow inspired in Eva her love for scholarly endeavors. She graduated with honors from Bronxville High School in 1955, being awarded a Regent’s college scholarship by the State Education Department. Eva Augenblick attended Radcliffe and graduated from Barnard College in 1959. A list of student acquaintances of hers at college would include notable achievers such as economist Fischer Black, psychologist Robert L. Helmreich , and cardiologist Robert M. Neer whom she married. Eva graduated as a physician at Columbia University in 1963. Three years later she joined Harvard University where she worked continuously for more than three decades. Eva Neer has been singled out for her \\"efforts to help women advance up the academic ladder\\". She died of complications from breast cancer in 2001, survived by her husband and two sons, Robert and Richard. A personal account of Eva Neer´s professional life was given by her close colleague David E. Clapham in an obituary note. Academic career Eva joined Harvard research staff in 1966. She was appointed Assistant Professor in Biochemistry in 1976, and full professor in 1991. She was ascribed to the Cardiology Division at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Neer served on the Board of Tutors in Biochemical Sciences at Harvard, as well as on the Harvard Students Research Committee at the Harvard Medical School. She combined the tools of chemistry, biology, physics and molecular biology to explain how cells interpret the messages they get from light, hormones and neurotransmitters. The author of numerous papers, she was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences and earned membership in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She was honored with the FASEB prize for basic research in 1987 and the American Heart Association’s basic research prize in 1996. She was also an adviser to the National Institutes of Health. Research Eva Neer's early research, performed under the guidance of Professor Guido Guidotti, was devoted to study aspects of hemoglobin chemistry. These included the role of sulfhydril groups of alpha and beta chains on the quaternary conformation of the molecule. She showed their importance in subunit interface interaction and functional cooperativity for oxygen binding. This binding is an essential property for oxygen transport in blood and is often referred as Bohr effect. While still at Guidotti's lab Eva undertook independent research on the biochemical mechanisms of vasopressin's action on kidney's distal tubules. She described the purification and kinetic properties of vasopressin-sensitive adenylate cyclase from rat renal medulla. It would be later shown that vasopressin acts through a G protein-coupled receptor. This was the topic of Eva's work for most of her research career. In order to dissect out different aspects of G protein messaging complexities Eva studied a variety of tissues including brain cortex, rat testis, pigeon erythrocytes, heart, brain, retina- rods. Some of her most cited research findings include: *Purification and properties of free and membrane-bound adenylate cyclase (1978) *Size and detergent binding of adenylate cyclase from bovine cerebral cortex (1978) *The site of alpha-chymotryptic activation of pigeon erythrocyte adenylate cyclase (1978) *Calmodulin activates the isolated catalytic unit of brain adenylate cyclase (1981) *Location and function of reactive sulfhydryl groups of alpha subunit 39 (1987) *Action of G protein subunits on the cardiac muscarinic K+ channel (1987, 1988) *Cloning and differential expression of alpha-subunit types in human tissues and cell types (1988) *alpha-s and alpha-o synthesis in GH3 cells (1996) *Structure-function aspects of activation of PLC by G protein subunits: site mutation studies. (1998) Along her career, Professor Neer authored a number of highly cited review articles on structural and functional aspects of G protein and its subunits.

Budhanilkantha Temple is situated below the Shivapuri Hill at the northern end of the Kathmandu valley. and can be identified by a large reclining statue of Lord Vishnu. The temple's main statue of Budhanilkantha is considered the largest stone carving in Nepal. thumb Budhanilkantha Temple Entrance  Location  Budhanilkantha temple, also known as the Narayanthan Temple, is situated in Kathmandu. Though the temple is named Budhanilkantha, its name does not come from the Buddha; Budhanilkantha stands instead for “Old Blue Throat”. The statue symbolizes Lord Vishnu, who is regarded as one of the 'Trimurtis', along with Brahma and Shiva. Deity The main statue is a black stone structure carved from a single block of black basalt. The statue stands 5 meters tall (around 16.4 feet) and is positioned in the middle of a recessed pool of water, which is 13 meters (42.65 feet) long. It depicts the deity reclining on the coils of the cosmic serpent Shesha. He holds the Sudarshana Chakra, Club, a Conch Shell and a gem in his four hands. He is well adorned with a crown engraved with multiple Kirtimukha images which can often be seen being overlapped by a silver crown. This temple is regarded as a sacred place for Hindus but equally well venerated by Buddhists which is an excellent example of religious harmony in Nepal.  Origin of the statue  According to one story, a farmer and his wife once struck a figure while plowing the field, which caused it to start soaking blood into the ground. This turned out to be the figure of the lost deity of Budhanilkantha, which was recovered and placed in its present position. Another legend states that the statue was sculpted and brought to its current location in Kathmandu during the reign of the seventh-century monarch Vishnu Gupta, who controlled the Kathmandu Valley under the Lichchhavi king Bhimarjuna Dev. Budhanilkantha Temple Compound It was suggested for many years that the statue floats in the pool. Indeed, limited access to scientific rigour in 1957 failed to confirm or refute the claim but a small chip of the statue did confirm it to be silica-based stone but with a remarkably low density similar to lava rock. The Floating statue continues to fascinate and the number of subsequent requests for access to study its physical nature have been declined. Festivals The Budhanilkantha Temple has become the site where Haribondhini Ekadashi Mela takes place on the 11th day of the Hindu month of Kartika (October–November). Attended by thousands of pilgrims, it is the temple's principal festival in celebration of the awakening of Lord Vishnu from his long sleep. The Legend of the Nepal Monarchy A legend states that King Pratap Malla (1641–1674) had a prophetic vision. This vision resulted in him believing that the kings of Nepal would die if they visited the Budhanilkantha Temple. Nepali monarchs after King Pratap Malla have never visited the Temple in fear of the prophecy.

It is not relieved by ordinary medical, surgical, nursing, or pharmaceutical measures. Unlike the more common chronic pain, it causes adverse biologic effects on the body's cardiovascular, hormone, and neurologic systems. Patients experience changes in testosterone, estrogen, cortisol, thyroid hormones, and/or pituitary hormones. Both men and women require testosterone, however many doctors neglect to test women for low testosterone. Untreated Intractable Pain can cause death. Legal Definitions The exact definition of intractable pain varies based on the source and is not generally agreed upon. Several states (California, Colorado, Florida, New Jersey, Texas, Virginia, Minnesota and Washington) have passed intractable pain laws or guidelines. Texas, under their Intractable Pain Treatment Act, defines Intractable Pain as a state of pain for which the cause of the pain cannot be removed or otherwise treated and in the generally accepted course of medical practice, relief or cure of the cause of the pain is not possible or has not been found after reasonable efforts.http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/OC/htm/OC.107.htm Florida's Intractable Pain statute defines “intractable pain” as pain for which, in the generally accepted course of medical practice, the cause cannot be removed and otherwise treated.http://www.flsenate.gov/laws/statutes/2011/458.326 Treatments Although Intractable Pain is not curable, there are treatments. The aim of IP treatment is to appreciate the pain caused by the root condition in order to minimize or reverse the neurological, endocrine, and cardiac changes. The specific treatments depend on the cause of the pain, the physician's preference, and the patient's health and preferences. These treatments can be used on their own, but are commonly combined with one another. Not every patient will respond to every treatment, but some more common treatments include: * Surgical repair, such as spinal fusion for scoliosis * Opioid medications * Medical cannabis and/or cannabinoid therapy * TENS Unit * Spinal cord stimulator (SCS) - utilizes the gate control theory to block painful signals by sending benign electrical signals along the nerve roots.http://TameThePain.com * Intrathecal Pain Pump - delivers a very small amount of the chosen medication directly to the thecal space (next to the spinal cord, even closer than an epidural)http://TameThePain.com * Epidural, nerve root, and/or trigger point corticosteroid injections * mu-Opioids - Depending on the specific drug, opioids can be oral, transdermal, IV, intramuscular, subcutaneous, transmucosal, sublingual, intranasal, epidural, or intrathecal. Examples include morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone, oxycodone, codeine, buprenorphine * methadone - methadone is a mu-opioid, kappa-opioid, and NMDA receptor antagonist. It is used for neuropathic pain, however it is also useful for other types of pain, such as bone pain, and musculoskeletal pain. Some medications can be used to potentiate the primary treatment, this is most commonly done to boost the efficacy of opioids and minimize the dose of the opioid needed to alleviate the pain. Some of these treatments are also used on their own, examples include: * Muscle Relaxants * Stimulants * Mood Stabilizers (anti-epileptics and antipsychotics), such as gabapentin (Neurontin/Gralise/Horizant), pregabalin (Lyrica), topiramate (Topamax), quetiapine (Seroquel), risperidone (Risperdal), aripiprazole (Abilify), paliperidone (Invega), iloperidone (Fanapt), ziprasidone (Geodon), lamotrigine (Lamictal), or valproic acid (Depakote). * SSRI antidepressants, such as fluoxetine (Prozac/Sarafem), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa), or escitalopram (Lexapro) * SNRI antidepressants, such as duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq, or milnacipran (Savella) * NSAIDs - Ibuprofen (Advil/Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn/Aleve), celecoxib (Celebrex), diclofenac (Voltaren/Flector), or ketorolac (Toradol) * Physical Therapy Causes There are many painful conditions that can cause intractable pain disease. Not every patient with these conditions will develop intractable pain, but the following conditions are known to cause Intractable Pain in some patients: * Failed Back Syndrome * Scoliosis, Kyphosis, kyphoscoliosis * Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) * Degenerative Disk Disease * Rheumatoid Arthritis * Central Pain Syndrome (CPS) * Migraine * Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes Notable Figures Although not recognized during their lifetimes, John F Kennedyhttp://foresttennant.com/foresttennant/wp- content/uploads/2016/12/905-Feature-JFK-Tennant.pdf and Howard Hughes are both believe to have suffered from Intractable Pain.

The series centers on a family of immortal witches known as the Beauchamps: Joanna by Julia Ormond and her daughters Freya by Jenna Dewan-Tatum and Ingrid by Rachel Boston, as well as her sister Wendy by Mädchen Amick. Main characters=Joanna Beauchamp= Joanna Beauchamp is portrayed by Julia Ormond. Julia Ormond portrays Joanna Beauchamp, Ingrid and Freya's mother. She is an immortal witch who has lived for thousands of years, and has the powers of healing, telekinesis and limited weather control. Joanna and her sister Wendy (Mädchen Amick) originate from the magical world of Asgard, but they were banished by their father who became corrupt after coming into power. She also has a son named Frederick, who was left behind in Asgard. Joanna is cursed to watch her daughters Ingrid (Rachel Boston) and Freya (Jenna Dewan- Tatum) die young over and over again, but only to fall spontaneously pregnant again so the endless cycle can begin anew. After their thirteenth incarnation, Joanna decided to keep her daughters in the dark about their magical abilities in an attempt to protect them from the curse. At the beginning of season one, evil shape shifter Penelope Gardiner (Virginia Madsen) disguises herself as Joanna and kills local elderly man Bill Thatcher. When Joanna gets arrested for the murder, she tells Ingrid that she and Freya are witches. After Bill's wife Maura (Gillian Barber) says she saw Joanna kill him, Wendy uses a memory spell to erase Maura's memory of the murderer. She is then discredited as a witness in her husband's murder and Joanna is exonerated. Her ex-husband and the father of her children, Victor (Joel Gretsch) returns to East End and they sleep together. In the season finale, she falls into Penelope Gardiner's trap. The woman reveals herself as Athena Browning, the daughter of Archibald Browning, the man Joanna killed in 1906, and injects her body with poisonous argentium. With Wendy's help, Joanna manages to kill Penelope and later witnesses Ingrid open the portal to Asgard. In season two, Joanna is severely weakened by argentium. Her long-lost son, Frederick, appears on her doorstep and cures her, effectively winning back her trust and love. She introduces Frederick to her daughters and is happy to once again have her family back together, though Wendy is very distrustful of Frederick. Joanna later finds out that Freya and Victor have been kidnapped by two evil witches and goes to find them. Though she finds them, she finds Freya tied to deadly explosives and is forced to sacrifice one of her loved ones to save the other. In the end, Victor sacrifices himself, breaking Joanna's heart. When Ingrid and Freya die - again - she attempts to commit suicide, forcing Wendy to bring their father, Nikolaus, to their world to resurrect her daughters. Though he holds his end of the bargain, Joanna and the others are still distrustful of the man and travel back in time to collect a weapon to kill him. Her father sends Mason Tarkoff after them and she ends up only escaping with her life intact. However, by combining her powers with Freya's, Ingrid's and Wendy's, they manage to kill Nikolaus once and for all. =Wendy Beauchamp= Wendy Beauchamp is portrayed by Mädchen Amick. Mädchen Amick portrays Wendy Beauchamp, Joanna's long-estranged sister. Wendy is a witch and is cursed with the ability to change into a black cat. She has died several times but comes back to life in a matter of hours, due to her having nine lives. Her powers are healing, telekinesis and limited weather control. Wendy and her sister Joanna (Julia Ormond) originate from the magical world of Asgard, but they were banished by their father who became corrupt after coming into power. When she accidentally kills Joanna's daughter Ingrid (Rachel Boston) in 1906, Joanna tells Wendy to leave East End and never come back. At the beginning of season one, Wendy returns to East End to warn Joanna that her life is in danger, and that she will need help from Ingrid and Freya (Jenna Dewan-Tatum) to save her. After Joanna's daughters discover that they are witches, Wendy teaches them how to use their powers. Wendy later begins a romantic fling with an entomologist named Leo Wingate (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), after she steals his prized Himalayan Stamped Crown butterfly to use for a spell. When evil shape shifter Penelope Gardiner (Virginia Madsen) reanimates the corpse of Ingrid from 1906, she sends past Ingrid after Wendy and kills her. Although Wendy was eventually revived, Joanna notices that her necklace has turned red, which means she is now on her ninth and final life. In the beginning of season two, Wendy meets a paramedic named Tommy Cole and instantly form a liking to one another. When her nephew appears, she is incredibly suspicious of his motives, which are further encouraged by mysterious murders that started around the time Frederick arrived. She eventually comes to trust him when he saves her from the Mandragora, but loses her trust again when she finds out he was still in alliance with her father - the man who cursed her and her family. When Joanna attempts to commit suicide after facing Ingrid and Freya's death, she reluctantly agrees to bring Nikolaus to Earth in hopes of resurrecting the girls. She gives up her last life to save her boyfriend, and her spirit was taken to the Underworld where she is greeted by her \\"other sister\\". The character of Wendy does not appear in the book version like the other main characters. In an interview with Collider.com, Mädchen Amick revealed that Wendy was originally brought into the show as a guest for the pilot episode, but after it was filmed, Lifetime decided to make Wendy a permanent character. Amick described her as a troublemaker who is \\"very loyal to her family\\". Amick said that during the first week filming Witches of East East, she noticed that Wendy is quite similar to the character Serena from Bewitched, and thinks that Serena \\"is an inspiration for Wendy\\". =Ingrid Beauchamp= Ingrid Beauchamp is portrayed by Rachel Boston. Rachel Boston portrays Ingrid Beauchamp, Freya's older sister. Ingrid works as a librarian. She did a dissertation on witchcraft and historical occult practices in post-colonial New York towns, but she never believed in magic before finding out she was a witch. Ingrid has lived many past lives, and in each one she dies young, only to be reborn again. She has the powers of healing, telekinesis and limited weather control, and has the ability to write new spells. At the beginning of season one, when Joanna (Julia Ormond) gets arrested for murder she tells Ingrid that she and her sister are witches. Ingrid finds the family's grimoire to look for a spell to save Freya (Jenna Dewan-Tatum) who is trapped inside a painting, and a resurrection spell to revive Wendy (Mädchen Amick) who was killed by the evil shape shifter Penelope Gardiner (Virginia Madsen). However, when she comes back to life, Wendy tells Ingrid that the spell comes with a price - \\"If you resurrect someone you love, someone you love has to die\\". She dates detective Adam Noble (Jason Winston George) but their relationship ends when Adam dies as a result of Ingrid's resurrection spell. Ingrid later meets a novel writer named Mike (Enver Gjokaj), who believes that witches exist in East End and that they came from the magical world of Asgard. In the season one finale, Mike holds Ingrid at gunpoint to make her open the portal to Asgard, but the light within kills him instantly. In season two, Ingrid starts working as a curator for documentary preservation of witchcraft. She finds herself blacking out repeatedly and unable to remember that she has been visiting a creature known as the Mandragora. Meanwhile, Ingrid confesses to Dash that she is a witch and he is a warlock after witnessing him kill a man and chooses to help him hide the secret. At the end of the series, she finds out she is pregnant, though unsure who the father is; Dash or the Mandragora. In an interview with TV Wise, Rachel Boston revealed that before filming the pilot episode, she read many books on witchcraft to prepare for the role of Ingrid. Boston described Ingrid as smart and sensitive, and said that she \\"is ruled by her mind, intellect, and invention\\". When Boston was asked if there were any similarities between her and Ingrid, she said that there was because she relate to being out of her \\"comfort zone and in an unfamiliar land figuring it out step by step\\". =Freya Beauchamp= Freya Beauchamp is portrayed by Jenna Dewan-Tatum.

However, when the local post office was established the authorities named it Viljoenshof in honour of DJ Viljoen, the Dutch Reformed (NGK) minister of Bredasdorp from 1904 to 1934; this name was then extended to the village. The original name Wolvengat was officially restored in 1991. In the early 1900s the village had a school with 100 children, but by the early 21st century there was neither a church nor a school. The fertile soil, and the potential of using land for vineyards, explains the high property prices.

Her wreck site was discovered in 1982 and received statutory protection as a historic shipwreck in 1983. The wreck site was the subject of an underwater survey in March 1984. She is notable for being the first European vessel to enter the River Murray via its mouth, her role in the charting of the lower reaches of the River Murray including Lake Alexandrina whilst under the command of William Pullen and her association with Edward John Eyre. Origins Water Witch was built at Hobart Town, Van Diemen's Land by John Gray during 1835. Career The vessel was originally built for George Watson and James Smith. She was subsequently owned by Richard Griffiths (1836), William Parcell (1837) and Thomas Strangways (1839). In 1839, she was purchased by the South Australian Government to replace the brig Rapid. After short career in Tasmania, she was brought to South Australia by Parcell where her duties involved voyages to Thistle Island in Spencer Gulf, Sydney Portland, Port Phillip and King George Sound where she was abandoned by the master and crew. Under the ownership of Strangways, she worked in Encounter Bay. As a South Australian government vessel, she was initially engaged with the charting the lower channels of the River Murray and Lake Alexandrina under the command of William Pullen. During April 1840, she accompanied the brig Porter which was conveying Governor Gawler to Port Lincoln, where he explored the east coast of Eyre Peninsula in the company of John Hill. In May 1840 she conveyed Hill to Point Riley, from where he reportedly made the first European crossing, on horseback, of Northern Yorke Peninsula.Roslyn M. Paterson and Eyvonne L. Price, From Stumps to Stubble : A history of the District of Bute (Adelaide, 1984), , page pp.49–52. From June 1840 to January 1841, she supplied Eyre’s expedition at locations such as the head of Spencer Gulf, Streaky Bay and Fowlers Bay. In 1841, her range was restricted to Gulf St Vincent due to her leaky condition. On Pullen's suggestion, she was sent to Encounter Bay where on 8 May 1841, she became the first European vessel to successfully enter the River Murray mouth. E. B. Scott, a friend of Eyre, who had assisted Pullen in his task of surveying Lake Albert acted as mate, and negotiated her from Wellington to Moorundie (some 5 km downstream from present-day Blanchetown).Mudie, Ian Riverboats Sun Books Melbourne 1965 p. 200 This journey helped establish Moorundie (often spelled \\"Moorundee\\") as the first European settlement on the River Murray in South Australia. On 3 July 1841, Water Witch was offered for sale at Goolwa. By March 1842, she was located at Moorundie, where Eyre (who had explored the area in 1839) was serving as the Protector of Aborigines and the Resident Magistrate. Sinking  She sunk at her mooring at Moorundie during a storm on 5 December 1842. The loss was attributed to the vessel being in \\"poor repair\\". Her loss was reported by Eyre. Discovery and survey of wreck site During 1970, a group of recreational divers under the direction of Robert Sexton, an amateur maritime historian, unsuccessfully searched for the wreck site at Moorundie. In 1981, the Society for Underwater Historical Research (SUHR) conducted desktop research followed by underwater searches also without any success. Later in 1982, the SUHR revisited the problem after the discovery of a drawing prepared by Edward Charles Frome in March 1842 showing a vessel moored at Moorundie. The depicted vessel was considered to Water Witch on the basis of research showing that she was the only vessel known to have sailed on the River Murray at the time. In August 1982, the location of the scene drawn by Frome was confirmed on site and a subsequent underwater search of the mooring location revealed a mound of ballast, loose timber and other artefacts.Drew, Terry; 1983, 'Waterwitch' (sic), Annual Report 1983, Society for Underwater Historical Research, North Adelaide, SA, page 7. In March 1984, a project to survey and partially excavate the wreck site was carried out by the Department of Environment and Planning and the SUHR with assistance from the SA Police STAR Force Dive Section. The underwater survey work was carried in total darkness using diver communications system incorporated in full face diving masks. The project received grant funding as part of the celebration of the sesquicentenary (150th anniversary) of European settlement in South Australia in 1986.‘Team to dive on River Murray Mouth wreck’ (sic), The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA), 14 July 1983.Drew, Terry; 1984, 'Waterwitch' (sic), Annual Report 1984, Society for Underwater Historical Research, North Adelaide, SA, pages 9-12. A subsequent analysis of materials recovered from the wreck site positively identified the site as being the remains of Water Witch. The present day The majority of the wreckage remains on the river bed covered with sand bags and the vessel’s ballast. The site was declared a historic shipwreck under the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1981 (SA) during April 1983. The wreck site is officially located at . Water Witch is also remembered in the naming of two features in the coastal waters of South Australia - the Water Witch Channel located in Smoky Bay west of the town of Smoky Bay and Water Witch Bay located near Port Pirie.

History Mountain View Hospital opened in 1967 as the lone hospital of the Mountain View Hospital District. Land for the facility was donated by the Bean Foundation. The St. Charles Health System began providing administrative services to the hospital in 1998.

Plans called for a new main building of to house patient beds, the emergency department, radiology, and other care facilities, while the existing space would be converted to administrative and office facilities. However, the expansion never materialized due to a lack of finances. Instead, the hospital district sought to merge with the larger St. Charles Health System in July 2012. A deal was reached in October 2012 to merge the hospital, and the merger was completed in January 2013 with the hospital becoming St. Charles – Madras. Operations St. Charles – Madras has 36 licensed beds, but only has 25 available, and is the only hospital in Jefferson County. The acute care facility is a level four trauma center and serves the entire county, plus portions of neighboring Wasco County and the Warm Springs Indian Reservation. The state of Oregon classifies the hospital as a Type B Rural hospital and as a critical access facility. Services at the facility include maternity, surgery, radiology, an intensive care unit, and emergency services, among others. For 2012, the hospital had a total of 814 discharges, with 3,113 patient days, and 10,737 emergency department visits. Also that year were 155 births and 172 inpatient surgeries.

When the Rizaiqāt chief Madībbū Bey ʿAlī refused a summons, his forces were attacked near Sẖaqqa. They lost the ensuing battle and Madībbū fled north.

Since the death of Stefan Germer in 1998, Graw has acted as publication's sole publisher.  Contents  Texte zur Kunst is published in the small journal format of 166 x 230 mm and contains approximately 300 pages. Issues are thematic and feature essays, interviews, and round-table discussions that address culture-sector questions relating to contemporary art, socio-political theory, and cultural policy from an art historical and sociological perspective. Themes focus on areas of art, institutional critique, feminism, media criticism and theory of subjectivity. In an interview with Ingo Arend for the Die Tageszeitung, Isabelle Graw positioned the magazine as left-wing. Artist and curator Wolfgang Müller describes it as individualistic neoliberal and hermetic. The magazine is influenced by the journal October, but differentiates itself by also covering pop-culture. Unlike other art magazines, it aims to critically examine rather than promote art and demystify the production conditions of art.  Editions  With each issue, Texte zur Kunst offers artist's editions by contemporary artists, which help support the journal's publication.

She hosted a literary salon in Uppsala 1812-1835 and has been described as the center of the salon in Uppsala during the Romantic era. She is known as the patron of Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom, who greatly admired her, and as one of the earliest supporters of the Fosforisterna, a group of romantic poets in Uppsala. Life Eleonora Charlotta d'Albedyhll was the daughter of riksråd count Anders Reinhold Wrangel and Eleonora Mariana Barnekow. In 1795, she married baron Gustaf d'Albedyhll and moved to Nyköping. Her marriage was described as happy. Already during her early years, she was known to be intelligent, educated and a talented intellectual, and she was also described as a beauty. In 1812, Eleonora Charlotta d'Albedyhll and her spouse moved to Uppsala. In Uppsala, she founded a literary salon and became a center of the cultural life in the city, rivaling Malla Silfverstolpe. Originally a believer of academic sense, she became the patron of the circle of Romantic poets known as Fosforisterna, which is described as the breakthrough of the Romantic style in the contemporary high society. She was the benefactor of Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom, who was also her personal admirer and describes her: :\\"She is about forty, strongly built, with a proud composure, a majestic profile, who resembles that of Queen Louisa Ulrika; big, dark and shining eyes and black hair, which falls in many curls from her forehead. The larger part of the day she spends on reading or painting; when she is resting, she normally walks around in her cabinet with her zither hanging from her shoulder, and when her fingers travels across the strings, she truly looks like a song goddess...Among other things, she can perform almost ever part and mimic all people; in particular, she impersonates Gustav III excellently. The women in this city greatly fear her much and complains about her satirical tongue, though she does in fact judge them much more lightly than they her.\\"Eleonora Charlotta d'Albedyhll (f.

In 1807, she is known to have completed the novel Ludvig von Mansfeldt, though it was not published. From 1810 onward, d'Albedyhll had her poems published in publications such as the Lunds Veckoblad, Journal för Litteraturen och Theatern and Poetiska kalender.

It was established under the National Insurance Act 1946 and abolished and replaced by Widowed Parent's Allowance in 2001. William Beveridge's view was: \\"There is no reason why a childless widow should get a pension for life; if she is able to work, she should work. On the other hand, provision much better than at present should be made for those who, because they have the care of children, cannot work for gain or cannot work regularly\\". Main conditions The widow had to be receiving Child Benefit for a child who was either hers and her late husband's, or a child the husband was entitled to Child Benefit for before his death, or a child of hers by an earlier marriage which ended by her being widowed, if she was living with her late husband when he died, or she was expecting a child of her late husband's (a child conceived by artificial insemination counts if she was living with her husband after that), Or a person under 19 lives with her who would fit into the previous category, but didn't get Child Benefit at the time because he or she was abroad when the husband died. The amount was £77.45 a week in 2004 if the husband's contribution record was sufficient. It was possible to get a reduced rate of benefit and an earnings-related component. The benefit lasted as long as the children qualified her for it. The main benefit was taxable but the increase for children wasn't. The husband must have paid at least 52 times the minimum National Insurance contributions in any tax year before he died, and he must have paid contributions for sufficient years out of his working life. It was taken into account in full for all benefits. There was an addition of £11.35 a week for each child after the first, for whom £9.55 was payable.

Her maternal grandmother was from Goa. Her parents met in Hong Kong. She spent the early portion of her life learning how to cook, sew, knit, and crochet.Into the Gloss (February 2014) After World War II, her family traveled to Argentina, Peru and Spain. At the age of 19, she met the Spanish bullfighter, Luis Miguel Dominguín. When the relationship ended, Machado moved to Paris and found work modelling for Hubert de Givenchy. According to Machado, she was asked to model for Balenciaga, but he was out of town, so they sent her to Givenchy instead. > They thought I was filling-in for a sick girl, so they grabbed me, put me in > clothes, and threw me into the room where they were showing the collection. > I barely knew anything about walking like a model, so I just copied the girl > in front of me. At the end of the show, gorgeous Givenchy comes up to me and > says, \\"Would you like to be in the cabine?\\" — that's what they called the > group of models who worked for the house. That’s how it all started. She later worked for Oleg Cassini and Balenciaga. She worked for Givenchy for three years and during this time, she became the highest-paid runway model in Europe, earning $1,000 a day. In 1957, she married the actor Martin LaSalle, the son of a diplomat, and a student of political science at the Sorbonne, whom she met in Paris. Nonetheless, for a year during their courtship, she left him for the Oscar-winning actor William Holden, returning to LaSalle to marry him. The couple eventually settled in New York City where Machado met Diana Vreeland and through Vreeland, Richard Avedon, with whom she developed a very close friendship and called a \\"great mentor in her life\\". Machado and LaSalle had two daughters, Blanche and Emmanuelle. They divorced in 1965, after Machado had an affair with a friend of her husband's. Avedon declared that she was \\"probably the most beautiful woman in the world.\\" His photographs of her were the ones used in the February 1959 issue of Harper's Bazaar. > It was 1958, and the publishers were saying, \\"We can't put this girl in the > magazine.

In 1989, she was added to the International Best Dressed List. In 1991 she opened a gallery in Watermill, New York, when she left the fashion industry. Among the photographers who exhibited in the gallery were Hiro, Avedon, Lillian Bassman, Mary Ellen Mark, and Barbara Bordnick. The gallery closed in 1998, when she retired.

Mapping South: Journeys in South-South Cultural Relations. Melbourne: South Project. Origins The idea for the South Project emerged in the aftermath of the 1999 Melbourne Visual Arts Biennial. While the biennial was designed to be an ongoing feature of Melbourne's visual arts calendar, lack of support from participating countries meant it was unable to continue. Consideration was given to the model of Brisbane's Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art, which used a regional focus to gain profile. The concept of a southern focus emerged through a series of meetings held over 2001–2002 at the Australian Centre, University of Melbourne. The Director of Craft Victoria, Kevin Murray, developed the South Project in 2003 with support of the Australia Council's Visual Arts Craft Strategy and Myer Foundation. The idea was first introduced with the \\"Between You and Me\\" symposium on 18 March 2003, which featured stories about Australian craft practitioners working with traditional communities in Ernabella, Tiwi Islands, East Timor and Gujarat. On 2 April 2003, the Myer Foundation hosted a meeting of the directors of Victorian visual arts organisations at Cranlana to discuss the possibility of a major international festival focusing on the South. By late 2003, project officers Hannah Matthews and Christobel Harvey were appointed. Magdalena Morena became general manager in 2004. Major elements=Melbourne Gathering 2004= South 1: A New Conversation (1–4 July 2004, University of Melbourne) was a unique gathering of artists from more than 16 countries brought together to discuss what it means to live in the south. The opening keynote was given by Mbulelo Mzamane.Mbulelo, Mzamane. 2004. \\"Beyond Mythification: Constituting a Southern Identity.” Southern Perspectives. http://www.southernperspectives.net/beyond-mythification-constituting-a- southern-identity-by-mbulelo-vizikhungo There were 48 presentations designed to cover the breadth of southern cultural activity, including shared histories of struggle and displacement, current programs of cultural development and ideas for future collaborations across the latitude. These presentations were complemented by workshops, project clusters, performances, readings, walks and a welcoming bonfire hosted by members of the local Indigenous community. To complement the event, at Craft Victoria the exhibition of Cross Pollination, curated by Anna Davern and Vicki Mason, displayed works by Australian and New Zealand jewellers inspired by botany. =Wellington Gathering 2005= 'Between Earth and Sky' in Wellington was hosted by Te Papa Museum 19–21 October 2005. It began with a traditional Pōwhiri followed by talks and workshops featuring Maori, Pakeha, Australian Aboriginal and foreign speakers. \\"With the theme 'between sky and earth' – ways of making a place in a placeless world- the content of the gathering included a heady mix of indigenous, environmental and socially oriented art production.\\"Clarke, Jacquie. 2006. \\"The South Project 2 in Wellington  The Big Idea  Te Aria Nui.\\" The Big Idea – Te Aria Nui. 27 October. http://www.thebigidea.co.nz/node/28008. =Santiago Gathering 2006= The South American gathering 'Crossing Horizons' was held in Chile 1 – 4 October 2006 and hosted by the Centro Cultural Estacion Mapocho. It included talks at the Universidad de Chile, workshop at the Consejo Nacional de la Cultura in Valparaiso, residencies at Galeria Metropolitana and a performance by Domenico de Clario at the Pablo Neruda house La Sebastina. The two exhibitions were Trans Versa curated by Zara Stanhope and Danae Mossman, involving thirteen artists at three venues. And Make the Common Precious curated by Kevin Murray that make the link between 'poor craft' in Australia and the celebration of the ordinary in the poetry of Pablo Neruda. =Johannesburg Gathering 2007= The African gathering was held in Johannesburg 18–21 October 2007 at the Hector Pieterson Museum in Soweto. It was opened by William Kentridge. A Festival of the South was presented by the Mbuisa Makhubu Primary School (previously Belle Primary) in Orlando West, featuring results of residencies by Australian artists Sara Thorn, Maree Clarke and Emma Davies. There were also workshops at the Crafts Council of South Africa and African Theatre. =Common Goods: Cultures Meet through Craft= Common Goods was an exhibition for the 2006 Commonwealth Games at the Melbourne Museum involving residencies in host institutions around Victoria. Artisans were invited from Commonwealth countries, including Ahmed Nimad (Maldives) Audrey Boyle (New Zealand), Lewis Dick (Mauritius), Hlengiwe Dube (South Africa), Mary Farrugia (Malta), Niki Hastings-McFall (New Zealand), Zakir Hussain (India), Te Atiwei Ririnui (New Zealand), Margarita Sampson (Norfolk Island), Chandraguptha Thenuwara (Sri Lanka) and Julie Tipene-O'Toole (New Zealand). Each was partnered with a local host artists including Kerri Ann Abbott, Jennifer Bartholomew, Lorraine Connelly-Northey, Lucy Irvine, Wendy Lugg, Mark McDean and David Ray. Their collaborations were then exhibited at Melbourne Museum. According to Wulan Dirgantoro, \\"As many of these artists are no longer entirely dependent on traditional materials to produce their objects, this exhibition presents a challenge for viewers to see the complexity and breadth of 'world craft' outside the notion of exoticism and 'fourth world' façade.\\"Dirgantoro, Wulan. 2006. \\"Common Goods: Cultures meet through craft' Craft Australia. =South Artists in Residence= Institutions in Australia, Brazil, Fiji New Zealand and South Africa hosted artists as part of a residency program designed to facilitate exchange.

This included the story of Susu, an emu that wanted to fly like an eagle. This story was designed as an allegory of the way people of the South often wish they lived in the North. Children were encouraged to come up with solutions for the emu, as well as provide information about the flightless birds in their own country. Participating schools included: * Pembroke Primary School, Victoria * Collingwood College, Victoria * Abbotsford Primary School, Victoria * Carlton Primary School, Victoria * Taupo Primary School, New Zealand * Achao Primary School, Chiloe, Chile * Sculpture Academy, Port Luis, Mauritius * Mbuisa Makhubu Primary School in Soweto Legacy The South Project continued as a Craft Victoria project until December 2007, when it became an independent association under Director Magdalena Moreno. As an independent organisation, South Project hosted further gatherings in Melbourne and Yogyakarta. It closed down in 2013.

Built in 1926 to provide exhibit space for the Government of Ontario during the annual Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), that function later moved to the Ontario Place complex. After a period of disuse, Toronto City Council approved a long-term lease with the Liberty Entertainment Group to use the building for private events. Description The one-storey building has a triangular layout, fronting on Lake Shore Boulevard on the southwest, British Columbia Road on the north and Alberta Circle on the east. The building has a central open triangular courtyard with the three wings surrounding it. Along the property facing Lake Shore Boulevard is a large concrete plaza leading down to the road, originally to the lake. Beside the steps leading down are two carved stone lions. Each lion's pedestal bears a historical plaque. The reinforced concrete Beaux-Arts building was designed by the architectural firm of Chapman and Oxley, which designed several other public buildings in the area. The structure was built between November 1925 and August 1926 by contractors Sullivan and Fried Limited of Toronto. It was originally called the \\"New Ontario Government Buildings\\". The exterior was very ornate, but the interior (used for exhibit space) was originally not decorated, much like a warehouse. File:Ontario Government Building Aerial View 1929.jpg Aerial view of the building in 1929 File:Ontario Govt Building Lions 1936.jpg View of the stone lions on the grounds File:Liberty Grand.JPG Entrance to the building in 2005 History The building was built to display Government of Ontario exhibits during the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE). In 1971, the Government of Ontario opened Ontario Place on new artificial islands on Lake Ontario, just south of the site as a permanent exhibit of Ontario. Ontario discontinued its use of the building, which then became the site of general exhibits during the CNE. In 2000, the City of Toronto released a \\"Request for Proposals\\" for long-term development of the building. Of five proposals, Toronto City Council approved the Liberty Grand Proposal for a 20-year lease of the building. Liberty Entertainment Group agreed to spend 4.95 million on renovations and pay $3.76 million in rent for the 20 years to use the building as a private ballroom venue. The company refinished the interior with decorations and furnishings to match the exterior, and the building re-opened in 2001. The building now houses multiple ballrooms and can accommodate up to 3,000 guests. Liberty Grand The Liberty Grand Entertainment Complex has several areas for banquets and balls, including three grand ballrooms decorated in a traditional style, and one contemporary open-concept room =Governors Room= This is the largest ballroom of the complex, with a capacity of up to 1500 people. With a spacious entrance and foyer, this room incorporates a grand oak staircase to the upper mezzanine level, which overlooks the courtyard and main room. Traditional French doors open the main ballroom onto the courtyard with a view of the building's duomo. =Renaissance Room and Centennial Room= These two banquet rooms are a mirror image of one another. Each has a private entrance reception area with polished Italian marble floors, Renaissance-style columns and French doors into each ballroom. Floor-to-ceiling arched windows line the south wall of each room to exhibit a lakefront view from all angles.

Although castigated by the Russian government for the defeat of Russia in that war, he subsequently served on the Board of Admiralty and was member of the State Council (1914). Biography Avellan was born in Loviisa in the Grand Duchy of Finland. He graduated from the Sea Cadets Corps in 1855, and was promoted to lieutenant in 1857, and was assigned to the Baltic Fleet, and was promoted to lieutenant in 1872. In 1878, he took part in a naval expedition to the coasts of North America and was subsequently given command of the cruiser . Between 1879-1889 he made two world tours, commanding a number of different vessels. In 1889 he was promoted to Chief-of-Staff of Kronstadt naval base. He was promoted to rear admiral in 1891. From 1893–1894, Avellan commanded the Russian squadron in the Mediterranean, and visited the French Navy in Toulon (October 1893) to reinforce the Franco-Russian Alliance.L'Illustration, n° 2642 , October 14, 1893 From 1895-1897 he served as Deputy Chief-of-Staff of the Imperial Russian Navy. He then became Chief-of-Staff and was raised in rank the Adjutant-General in 1903. He served as Minister of the Navy from 10 March 1903 to 29 June 1905.

Befuddled as to how he is supposed to find anyone to act as godparent for his newly-born child, he withdraws to his chamber for the night. While fast asleep, he has a dream that tells him to leave his house and ask the first person he encounters to be his child's godparent. As soon as he awakens, he proceeds to do this. The man he meets and makes godparent of his newly-born child hands the impoverished man a small bottle containing water that the man claims the impoverished man can use to heal the sick, so long as the sickness stems from the head and not the feet. The impoverished man subsequently becomes both well-known and wealthy by cause of the magical water. He has a certain bout with treating the child of the King, in which he is able to use the magical water on two successive occasions, but is unable to do so on a third occasion, announcing thus to the King that his child will die. Not too long after the death of the King's child, the man decides to visit the Godfather (so as to tell him of his undertakings with the magical water). When he arrives at the Godfather's house, however, he notices that everything there is in disarray. On the first stair, a dustpan and brush quarrel with each other. On the second stair, many fingers lie. On the third stair is a stack of bowls. On the fourth stair are fish that are cooking themselves. On the fifth stair is the Godfather's room, and (when the man looks through the keyhole on the door to the room) he sees the Godfather, donning very long horns. The man opens the door, and (as soon as he does so) the Godfather retreats to a bed and cloaks himself. The man asks the Godfather about the odd happenings that are occurring in the house, to which the Godfather brushes off most of and counter-claims that the man was seeing things. Once the man brings up the self-cooking fish, however, the fish enter the room and present themselves (on a dish) to the Godfather. Finally, the man brings up how, when peeking through the keyhole on the door to the room, he saw the Godfather with long horns. At this, the Godfather bellows at the man that he is telling falsehoods. Frightened by the bellowing, the man bolts from the house.

The generations before had left a deep and abiding affinity for the land from which came not only their livelihood, but their legacy. For the Baldacci’s, family is everything. When they purchased the Stags Leap property, over 18 years ago, Thomas and Brenda knew that they had found a place for their clan to stay connected through the generations. As each new vintage unfolds, they look forward to sharing their wines and their story, with you. Second generation vintner Michael Baldacci, along with winemaker Ricardo Herrera, create limited production wines from three distinct estate vineyards located in the nested AVA’s of Calistoga, Stags Leap District and Los Carneros.

It is developed by the South Korean game developer Com2Us. The English language Windows version is published by Hamburg-based game publisher gamigo AG. An alternate version for IOS and Android also exists, self-published by Com2Us. Although there is no subscription fee or cost to download and play the game, the game offers \\"Star\\" and \\"Star Premium\\" membership plans for a monthly fee. Additional in-game items may also be purchased with real currency. On January 14, 2014, gamigo AG announced that Com2Us was discontinuing support for the English language PC version of GolfStar. The English PC version was shut down on February 24, 2014 (while mobile versions and the Korean language PC version still remain active). Publishing The US and European PC version of GolfStar is published by gamigo AG, and has support for English and German languages. The US and European IOS/Android version is self-published by Com2Us.  Gameplay (PC version)  The game allows players to compete together on several fictional and non-fictional courses in various modes of play. Modes vary from golf simulator staples such as stroke and match play, as well as more original modes such as skins match (in which players bet on each hole) and competition or team competition modes (which allow up to 30 players to compete on a course in real time, in order to speed up the gameplay). For each hole completed, the player earns both experience points and in-game currency called GP (\\"gamigo Points\\"). When the player accumulates enough experience points, their character will advance to the next level. By advancing levels, players receive AP (Ability Points) to improve their characters' stats (power, impact, control, and stamina), and eventually gain access to new items (clubs, clothing etc.). Players also accumulate Skill Points, which are used to learn new special skills and shots that allow players to fine-tune their stroke in various situations (such as the \\"Draw Shot\\", which adds more left sidespin to a shot, or the \\"Fried Egg Shot\\", which reliably hits a ball out of a bunker). GP can be used to purchase items such as clubs and clothing, as well as support items - such as \\"capsules\\" which are used during a round to replenish stamina points (HP) or intelligence points (MP, which depletes when skills are used). Clubs and clothing can also be \\"fitted\\" (which improves their overall stats) or \\"cloned\\" (which transfers the stat points from one item of clothing to another), A premium currency called Star Points also exists (purchasable with real currency), which can be used to purchase a much wider selection of fashion, clubs, and miscellaneous items and features. The game uses an \\"item rental\\" system - in which most items that are acquired or purchased (with in- game or real world currency) expire after a period of time (30, 60, 90 days, etc.), but can be renewed by purchasing \\"Renewal Tickets\\" (or \\"Star Renewal Tickets\\" for premium items). GolfStar classifies players as Beginner, Junior, Amateur, Semi-Pro, Pro, or National. After achieving the required level, players are allowed to take a qualifying test which allows them to rank-up upon passing, granting them access to higher-tiered items and clubs. Seasonal tournaments are also available each with specific rank and level limitations (the Rookie-Tour, AMA-Tour, SEMI-Tour, and the gPGU-Tour); with the top players in each tour being awarded prizes upon the tours' completion. 6 base characters are available. (2 character types are only able to purchased with Star Points). The basic character types are Patrick, Althea, Bert, and Zoe. The two Premium characters are David and Eve. (Premium characters have advantages, such as additional starting ability (stat) points, and faster XP gain rate). =Courses= There are a wide variety of courses based on real- world locations (such as TPC Sawgrass) and fictional designs (such as Sands Ocean and Safari). Playing them provides varying bonuses and experience points depending on the difficulty. The course feature variable weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind, rain, and even snow. Each course also has an \\"easy\\" and a \\"hard\\" mode available (playing on hard mode causes more unpredictable and extreme weather conditions) Gameplay (Mobile version)See also * Shot Online * Pangya ReferencesExternal links * Official site (PC) * Official site (mobile) Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:2011 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Golf video games Category:IOS games Category:Windows games Category:Video games developed in South Korea ","title":"GolfStar"},{"id":"41524853","text":"Dmitry Sinkovsky () is a Russian virtuoso violinist, concertmaster, countertenor and conductor.

It is produced by the Stanley brothers in Colorado. It does not induce the psychoactive \\"high\\" typically associated with recreational marijuana strains that are high in THC. In September 2014, the Stanleys announced that they would ensure that the product consistently contained less than 0.3% THC. Charlotte's Web is named after Charlotte Figi whose story had led to her being described as \\"the girl who is changing medical marijuana laws across America.\\" Her parents and physicians say she experienced a reduction of her epileptic seizures brought on by Dravet syndrome after her first dose of medical marijuana at five years of age. Her usage of Charlotte's Web was first featured in the 2013 CNN documentary \\"Weed\\". Media coverage increased demand for Charlotte's Web and similar products high in CBD, which has been used to treat epilepsy in toddlers and children. It was originally called \\"Hippie's Disappointment\\" as it was a strain that had high CBD and could not induce a \\"high\\". While initially anecdotal reports sparked interest in treatment with cannabinoids, there was not enough evidence to draw conclusions with certainty about their safety or efficacy. In 2018, Epidiolex (cannabidiol as the therapeutic ingredient) oral solution was approved by the FDA for two types of epilepsy.  Medical uses = Evidence = In 2014, there was little evidence about the safety or efficacy of cannabinoids in the treatment of epilepsy. A 2014 Cochrane review did not find enough evidence to draw conclusions about its use. A 2014 review by the American Academy of Neurology similarly concluded that \\"data are insufficient to support or refute the efficacy of cannabinoids for reducing seizure frequency.\\" The Cochrane review suggests cannabinoids be reserved for people with symptoms that are not controllable by other means, who have been evaluated by EEG-video monitoring to confirm diagnosis, and are not eligible for better-established treatments such as surgery and neurostimulation. A second review described four placebo- controlled trials of cannabidiol including 48 people with a disease that was not manageable by other means. Three out of four trials reported some reduction in seizures, but no comparison with placebo was possible due to the small number of people in the trials. The drugs were well tolerated. A third review found that no reliable conclusions about the effect of cannabis on epilepsy could be drawn due to the poor quality of available data, but further research may be warranted because of the good safety profile observed in small clinical trials. A 2017 study in children with drug-resistant Dravet syndrome, using a comparatively high dose of 20 mg/kg, found cannabidiol reduced convulsive seizures, but not non-convulsive seizures, and resulted in more side effects compared with placebo. Three phase 3 clinical trials completed in 2017 demonstrated the efficacy of cannabidiol in reducing convulsive seizure activity at doses of 10–20 mg/kg per day in children with treatment-resistant Dravet syndrome and treatment-resistant Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. = Statements = Due to the anecdotal nature of the health claims being made medical bodies have published statements of concern. A 2014 position statement by the American Epilepsy Society stated: > The recent anecdotal reports of positive effects of the marijuana derivative > cannabidiol for some individuals with treatment-resistant epilepsy give > reason for hope. However, we must remember that these are only anecdotal > reports, and robust scientific evidence for the use of marijuana is > lacking... at present, the epilepsy community does not know if marijuana is > a safe and effective treatment, nor do they know the long-term effects that > marijuana will have on learning, memory, and behavior, especially in infants > and young children. Cannabis-derived products were not mentioned in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence epilepsy treatment guidelines in 2012. = FDA approval = In June 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Epidiolex (cannabidiol as the therapeutic ingredient) oral solution for the treatment of seizures in two forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, for children two years of age and older.  History  Cannabis oil Charlotte's Web was developed in 2011 by the Stanley brothers (Joel, Jesse, Jon, Jordan, Jared and Josh) through crossbreeding a strain of marijuana with industrial hemp. This process created a variety with less tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and more cannabidiol (CBD) than typical varieties of marijuana. The variety shows potential for medical usage, especially for those who do not wish to experience the typical high of recreational marijuana use. As it is so low in THC, the variety was originally called \\"Hippie's Disappointment\\", and also has been labeled \\"boring\\". It is a less profitable plant with \\"close to no value to traditional marijuana consumers.\\" The Stanley brothers grow the plants at their farm and greenhouses. A CBD rich oil is extracted from the harvested plants and concentrated through rotary evaporation. To make it easier to perform clinical trials, they are planning to move the Charlotte's Web part of their operation to Uruguay. By doing so, they will also be able to import it into any U.S. state as hemp. The Realm of Caring Foundation (RoC), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, was set up by the Stanley brothers to help patients \\"who can't afford the treatment.\\" They have also started \\"Stanley Brothers Social Enterprises, Inc.\\", which has registered the trademark \\"Charlotte's Web Hemp Products\\". Some products are marketed through CW Hemp (formerly CW Botanicals).  Society and culture = Legal status = With the main ingredient being classified as \\"industrial hemp\\", (Agriculture Improvement act of 2018) Charlotte's Web Oil and other CBD products are legal in all 50 states, as long as the THC content is less than 0.3%. The publicity associated with Charlotte's Web has inspired a number of legislative bills, some of which are in the planning stages, and others that have been proposed or actually passed. Children, as \\"uniquely powerful advocates for medicinal pot across the country,\\" have inspired \\"the movement to legalize medicinal marijuana,\\" a movement which \\"has a face like Charlotte’s–and it’s a young one that’s hard to ignore. Lawmakers across the country are pushing legislation to legalize marijuana oil as a treatment for children with epilepsy.\\" Colorado law permits the use of medical cannabis for eight conditions: cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, muscle spasms, seizures, severe pain, severe nausea and dramatic weight loss, and muscle atrophy. The publicity surrounding anecdotal reports of successful treatment of intractable epilepsy with cannabinoids is likely to lead to a surge in interest. In 2013, the parents of a two-year-old with Dravet syndrome confronted New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who signed a bill allowing access for sick children to medical marijuana in a controversy dubbed \\"pot for tots\\". In 2014, legislative proposals in Utah, Arizona, New York, Washington state, Minnesota, and Florida were considered, where \\"even some staunch opponents of medical marijuana now are willing to make an exception\\" to allow the marijuana extract for medical treatment. In Utah, Rep. Gage Froerer, R-Huntsville, said in October 2013: \\"Nothing in federal or state law prohibits the sale or use of hemp products.\\" He pledged to consult with the Utah Substance Abuse Authority, saying: \\"We need to take a strong look at this and make sure that we as a legislature and we as citizens understand really what this is and what it's not.\\" In November 2013, he said he would address \\"three components in sponsoring legislation: access, quality control and research. He said the Utah Department of Health would probably be involved in quality-control efforts...\\" Annette Maughan, President of the Epilepsy Association of Utah, said: \\"The current Utah law doesn't exclude its use but also doesn't allow for its use. We are in limbo until Utah lawmakers decide what to call it.\\" On March 21, 2014, Gary Herbert, the governor of Utah, signed a bill giving \\"families access to the marijuana extract for treating epilepsy.\\" The state bill, HB0105, allows import of Charlotte's Web extract across state lines from Colorado to Utah, and covers only use for intractable epilepsy with the consent of a neurologist. Also on March 21, 2014, an Arizona court found \\"that Arizona's medical marijuana law allows consumption of the plant in extract form.\\" On March 20, 2014, the Florida House of Representatives Budget Committee passed the \\"so-called Charlotte's Web measure (CS/HB 843)\\" designed to limit prosecutors' ability to prosecute those in possession of low THC/high CBD marijuana (\\"0.5 percent or less of tetrahydrocannabinol and more than 15 percent of cannabidiol\\") used for treating seizures. The law took effect July 1, 2014. Since then, Florida legislators have passed a bill with bipartisan support legalizing the use of Charlotte's Web, and Governor Rick Scott signed the \\"Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act of 2014\\" (SB 1030) into law on June 6, 2014. The law is also referred to as the \\"Charlotte's Web\\" law. The law specifies the number of distribution centers, which types of nurseries can grow the plants, requires various other controls, and provides funding for research. * Federal legislation was introduced in 2014 (U.S. 113th Congress 2013-2014) but was never brought to a vote and died in committee. * Rep. Perry, Scott (R-PA-4) introduced to the U.S. 114th Congress (2015-2016) H.R.1635 - Charlotte's Web Medical Access Act of 2015 with 62 bipartisan co- sponsors. It has not been voted on yet, but it has made progress and been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the House Committee on the Judiciary, the Subcommittee on Health and the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations. * The Therapeutic Hemp Medical Access Act of 2015 (Senate 1333) was introduced (not passed yet) with 11 co-sponsors to amend the Controlled Substances Act to exclude cannabidiol and cannabidiol-rich plants from the definition of marijuana. It was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. On October 31, 2017, the FDA sent warning letters to four CBD marketers, including Stanley Brothers Social Enterprises, LLC (d/b/a CW Hemp), the producer of Charlotte's Web. They were warned \\"against making medical claims about cannabidiol (CBD). The agency also took issue with the businesses marketing CBD products as dietary supplements\\". = Reactions to CBD-only laws = The federal Schedule 1 drug classification blocks broad scientific research on cannabis. However, in late 2015, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) eased some regulatory requirements imposed by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) for those who are conducting FDA-approved clinical trials on cannabidiol (CBD). These modifications will streamline the research process regarding CBD’s possible medicinal value and help foster ongoing scientific studies. But the Marijuana Policy Project has expressed frustration over the fact that many legislative efforts inspired by Charlotte's Web are aimed at only legalizing low or no THC, high CBD medical marijuana products. They believe that such legislation is too restrictive and ignores claimed benefits of THC, leaving \\"behind around 98% of the individuals who can benefit from it.\\" Referring to the \\"Charlotte’s Web Medical Hemp Act of 2014\\", an editorial in Ladybud Magazine expressed concern that the law \\"leaves thousands of patients out in the cold without safe, legal access to medical cannabis. It also ignores science that seems to indicate that whole plant medicine is optimal.\\" = Etymology = Charlotte's Web is named after an American girl, Charlotte Figi, who developed Dravet syndrome (also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy or SMEI) as a baby. By age three, Figi was severely disabled and having 300 grand mal seizures a week despite treatment. Her parents learned about another child with Dravet Syndrome, who had been using a different type of medical marijuana since June 2011, and decided to try marijuana. Her parents and physicians said that she improved immediately. She followed a regular regimen that used a solution of the high- CBD marijuana extract in olive oil. She was given the oil under her tongue or in her food. Her parents said in 2013 that her epilepsy had improved so that she had only about four seizures per month, and she was able to engage in normal childhood activities. The type now named after Figi was not the first type her parents tried. As their original supply, a type called R4 that is also high in CBD and low in THC, was running out, they contacted the Stanley brothers. From the Stanleys' stock, they chose the high-CBD variety that has since been renamed to Charlotte's Web. The phrase is a reference to the children's novel of the same name. Charlotte's story has been featured on two CNN documentaries, The Doctors TV show, 60 Minutes Australia, and Dateline NBC, among many other sources. An article in the National Journal detailing the role of several children as \\"uniquely powerful advocates for medicinal pot across the country\\" described Charlotte as the \\"first poster child for the issue....\\" Her story has led to her being described as \\"the girl who is changing medical marijuana laws across America,\\" as well as the \\"most famous example of medicinal hemp use\\". On November 13, 2019, Charlottte was the first child featured on the cover of High Times magazine in her \\"Namesake\\" role as a \\"High Times Female 50\\" award nominee. Charlotte Figi died on April 7, 2020. = Publicity and demand = When Charlotte was five years old, her story was featured in the August 11, 2013, CNN documentary \\"Weed\\", hosted by Sanjay Gupta. On November 24, 2013, Paige Figi was a guest on The Doctors TV show, where Charlotte's story was told. She was also featured in Gupta's March 11, 2014, CNN documentary \\"Weed 2: Cannabis Madness\\". The extract received more publicity on October 6, 2014, when The Doctors TV show again featured a story about usage of Charlotte's Web. The physicians called for a change of the Federal classification. Sanjay Gupta has also expressed his support for Charlotte's Web on The Doctors TV show. On the October 17, 2014 episode of the ABC TV series The View, Paige Figi and Joel Stanley were interviewed by Whoopi Goldberg and Nicolle Wallace. The CNN documentaries received widespread publicity and popularized Charlotte's Web as a possible treatment for epilepsy and other conditions. Colorado has legalized both the medicinal and recreational use of marijuana, and many parents have flocked there with their suffering children in search of Charlotte's Web and other forms of medical marijuana. In November 2013, CBS Denver reported that \\"[t]here is now a growing community of 93 families with epileptic children using marijuana daily. Hundreds are on a waiting list and thousands are calling.\\" In October 2014, Time noted the Stanley brothers had a waiting list of \\"more than 12,000 families.\\" They have been termed \\"marijuana refugees\\", \\"part of a migration of families uprooting their lives and moving to Colorado, where the medicinal use of marijuana is permitted...forced to flee states where cannabis is off limits.\\" In November 2014, David Nutt mentioned Charlotte's Web in the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's Pharmaceutical Journal, where he appealed for \\"the UK government [to] acts on evidence, allowing the use of medicinal cannabis and reducing barriers to its research.\\" Families who say they have run out of pharmaceutical options have moved to Colorado to access Charlotte's Web. The demand has spurred calls for more research to determine whether these products actually do what is claimed. Amy Brooks-Kayal, vice president of the American Epilepsy Society, stated that epileptic seizures may come and go without any obvious explanation, and that Charlotte's web could cause developmental harm. She recommended that parents relocate so that their affected children could have access to one of the nation's top pediatric epilepsy centers rather than move to Colorado. The product has been described as the \\"country's most famous brand of CBD oil\\", the \\"largest selling CBD oil in the country\\", and the \\"number one brand\\", with 7% of the market. = Distribution = In November 2013, Josh Stanley said that Charlotte's web was 0.5% THC and 17% CBD, and that it \\"is as legal as other hemp products already sold in stores across Utah, including other oils, clothing, and hand creams, but is illegal, federally, to take across state lines.\\" The legalities of selling the product to people who transport it across state lines are complicated, with difficulties for both the sellers and transporters. Regardless of state laws in Colorado and Utah which would allow the practice, it is still a Federal offense to transport hemp products across state lines. In September 2014, the content was measured at 0.3% THC. = Initial public offering = On August 30, 2018, Charlotte's Web Holdings, Inc. (formerly Stanley Brothers Holdings Inc.) began its launch into the stock market with an initial public offering in Canada: \\"The offering included a treasury issuance by the company of common shares…moreover, a secondary offering of Common Shares…for total gross proceeds of C$115,115,000 (USD 87,598,872).\\"  Research  The relationship between the Schedule I status of cannabis in the United States and the lack of scientific research on cannabis has been claimed by some to be directly related. The situation has been described as a \\"catch-22\\" paradox: \\"Marijuana is restricted in large part because there is little research to support medical uses; research is difficult to conduct because of tight restrictions.\\" Sanjay Gupta has described the complex interaction between restrictive laws and lack of scientific research: > Gupta repeated throughout the evening that the \\"policy has outpaced the > science.\\" The states, he said, \\"are moving forward without waiting for the > science, and the issue is only compounded by the fact that the 'policies and > the laws we have in [the US] make it challenging for the science to get > done.\\" Even though the Florida \\"Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act of 2014\\" (SB 1030) provides funding for research, the status of all cannabis products as illegal Schedule I drugs has limited the amount of research, with the University of Florida refusing to do such research for fear of losing federal funding. The interest created by the documentary highlighted a need for increased scientific research, as well as caution against \\"bad medicine\\" and raising false hopes: Ed Maa, a specialist in epilepsy, stated: \\"This is not going away. ...I think it needs to be studied vigorously and very quickly.\\" He hopes to \\"launch a clinical trial to study the pot and its potential.\\" Physicians have called for more research to better understand the potential benefits of controlled use of medical marijuana; Sharon Levy, director of the Adolescent Substance Abuse Program at Children's Hospital Boston said: > \\"The AAP strongly supports more cannabinoid research to better understand > both how these substances can be used therapeutically as well as their > potential side effects—which we may well be underestimating...[But] the AAP > does not support 'medical marijuana' laws as they circumvent regulations put > in place to protect patients, and children are a particularly vulnerable > population.\\" Physicians have expressed both positive interest and worry about the sudden explosion of interest in the legalization of medical marijuana and its research, admitting legalization is both \\"a scientist's dream or a doctor's nightmare.\\" They fear that some parents are too open to trying anything before proper research has been conducted, and that they may be disappointed. They are \\"alarmed by parallels to past miracle-cure manias later proved false...\\" and \\"...wary of the heightened placebo effect in treatments involving children, when reports of progress depend on the view of parents.\\" There is also danger that \\"the [legalization] movement also opens the way for bad medicine...through treatments at best giving hope to the hysterical and at worst delivering damaging side effects.\\" According to Alan Shackelford, Charlotte Figi's physician: \\"We really don't know how it works... The cannabidiol seems to act as a neuro-stabilizer, but how? The research is minuscule on this.\\" Orrin Devinsky, a neurologist at New York University's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, where he will conduct clinical trials on Epidiolex, a high-CBD drug from GW Pharmaceuticals, expressed his sympathy for those who do not want to wait for research results: > I had a child who had failed 15 medications and drug treatments and there > was nothing else to do, and they were having many seizures a day that were > terribly disabling, I think it would be a very reasonable thing to do to try > a high-CBD cannabis product. He also expressed concern that the number of parents using the Charlotte's Web extract will make it harder to find children for the clinical trials, and that: > There are many more unknowns than knowns...the focus of the community—lay > and scientific and governmental—should be on getting good information. That > should be the real focus of what we need right now. The Epilepsy Foundation and Devinsky issued a joint statement calling for increased research and immediate access to medical marijuana, specifically naming Charlotte Figi's case. Devinsky said: > We need to make a balanced decision about compassionate use. If I were > Charlotte Figi's parents and lived in Colorado I would have done exactly > what they did. And as a doctor, I would gladly prescribe marijuana products > for many of my patients who failed existing therapies if it were legal in my > state. ... Until we have the scientific data, we should make medical > marijuana available to physicians who care for people with treatment- > resistant epilepsy and their patients. Due to reports that some people with Dravet syndrome seem to benefit from treatment with Charlotte's Web, an observational clinical trial was launched in September 2014 at the University of Colorado. The study will run until February 2016, will focus on genetic differences between people who respond and do not respond, and attempt to determine if such genetic factors may be related to the success or failure of treatment. Veterinary researchers at Colorado State University are researching a number of factors and illnesses relevant to both humans and animals: pharmacokinetics, safety, different methods of CBD dosing, idiopathic epilepsy, osteoarthritis, and certain types of cancers.

She starred in a number of successful comic operas, Edwardian musical comedies, and comic plays in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and London during the 1880s and 1890s. After gaining notice for her role in the American production of Olivette (1880), she became known for her performances in the title role of the original American production of Iolanthe (1882), in the long-running comic opera Erminie (1886), the title roles in Featherbrain (1884) and Nadjy (1888), and her role in The Oolah (1889). Later in her career, she performed in vaudeville and formed her own touring theatre company. Jansen ran into financial difficulties, by the late 1890s, partly due to losses as a producer, that left her in reduced circumstances for the remainder of her life.

Jansen next played Angelina, a circus equestrian, opposite Wilson, in The Lion Tamer, opening in December 1891, with book and lyrics by Goodwin, music by Richard Stahl and orchestrations by John Philip Sousa. In 1892, she left Wilson's company and appeared in Rosedale, by Lester Wallack, in Boston.\\"Fleeting Fame\\", The Junior Munsey, Volume 11, October 1901 to March 1902, p. 877. In 1893 Jansen began a several-years-long tour at Boston's Howard Athenaeum as Trixie Hazelmere the Queen of the Vaudevilles in Delmonico's at Six, a comic play written specifically for her by Glen MacDonough. Over the season of 1897–98 she played Pearl Dodo in a musical farce by Frank Tannehill, Jr., entitled The Nancy Hanks, a success in which she and Tannehill \\"succeeded in bringing down the house on several occasions.\\"\\"At Gotham's Playhouses\\", The Opera Glass: A Musical and Dramatic Magazine, Vol. 5, No. 1, January 1898, p. 5 Later years A subsequent venture into vaudeville with her own company failed due to Jansen's unsophisticated approach towards finances, and by 1904 Jansen was forced into bankruptcy. Jansen was thought to have earned over her career an estimated $500,000, but by the time of her bankruptcy she was unable to pay a $7 a-week bill for lodging while working as seamstress and occasionally appearing on stage in minor roles. Reportedly because of her drinking, Jansen's relationship with her twice widowed father\\"Marie Jansen's Loss\\", Boston Daily Globe, March 20, 1894, p. 11 and Lulu, his third wife, soured around 1901. As a result, after Benjamin Johnson's death in January 1906, Jansen received only $500 from his $30,000 estate, with the bulk of the funds going to his widow. Jansen sued but eventually failed to convince a Boston court that her stepmother had an undue influence over her father in drafting his final will.\\"Marie Jansen\\", Lowell Sun, September 22, 1906, p. 4 Jansen's last known stage appearance came in the fall of 1908 at New York's Olympic Theatre as a principal performer in comedian Edmond \\"The Wise Guy\\" Hayes' vaudeville show, Mardi Gras Beauties.\\"Vaudeville\\", The New York Times, October 11, 1908, p.

He was born deaf and was orphaned. He was a creative child, and at age eleven he was taken to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by a William P. Davis who pretended to be deaf, and made money off of Newsam's talents. In 1820, Newsam was placed in the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf, where he attended school. Mid-life and career He started an engraving apprenticeship in 1827. He worked for Cephas G. Childs. Newsam trained under George Catlin, and other engravers. Newsam's work was published by Childs starting in 1829. After working for Childs, he became principal artist for Peter S. Duval. Newsam specialized in portraits, which he painted and also etched on stone to make lithographs. He also worked off of the work of photographers and artists, such as Henry Inman and Gilbert Stuart, among others. Newsam created portraits of politicians, religious figures, and wealthy people. He also created landscapes, medical illustrations, and sheet music. Later life, death, and legacy His eyesight started to decline in 1857. In 1859, Newsam suffered a stroke. This affected his ability to work, and ended his career. He lived at the Living Home for the Sick and Well in Delaware until his death. His stay at the home was financially sponsored by his friends.

It is known as the first Japanese plastic model manufacturer and also famous for selling PVC kaiju (monster) character toys during the 1960s. Its headquarters were located in Taitō, Tokyo.  History  Marusan was founded in 1947 by three relatives, Haruyasu Ishida, his brother Minoru Ishida and brother-in-law Yasuo Arai. Its business was mainly selling tin toys and optical toys. In 1950, the company was formally incorporated as . Its logo was \\"SAN\\" in a circle since \\"maru\\" means circle, in Japanese. Initially, their business was a wholesale, but they eventually began to design and produce their own toys such as celluloid dolls and tin toys. In 1953, they released the elaborate tin toy \\"1951 Cadillac \\". It was a huge success also in the US market. In 1954 they launched the tin toy SSN submarine series and a vinyl \\"Mammy doll\\". Submarine toy could run underwater over 10m by friction motor. In 1958, Marusan released their first plastic model kit, based on the submarine USS Nautilus. This model was recognized as the first Japanese domestic plastic model kit, though it was actually a copy of Revell's product. The following year, they started to sponsor Japanese TV program focused on promoting plastic model kits into the Japanese market. They called their plastic model kits and registered it as a trademark in 1959. Marusan also tied up with Revell in 1960 and sold many Revell plastic models in Japan. In 1966, they introduced \\"Ultra-kaiju\\" PVC figures. These tough toys won children's hearts and were very successful in business. In 1967 Marusan changed their name to \\"Maruzan Co., Ltd.\\"(K.K.マルザン). New logo was \\"san\\", not \\"zan\\", in a red circle. Although the reason for change of the name was for wishing development of the company, Maruzan was unexpectedly bankrupted in 1968. After the bankruptcy of Marusan three companies were established: In 1969 Minoru Ishida rebuilt Marusan as \\"Marusan Co., Ltd\\". New logo was again \\"SAN\\" with white band in a red circle. At the same time, Koutaro Ishida, a nephew of Minoru Ishida, built a new company named \\"Bullmark\\" along with two other ex-employees of Marusan, Saburo Ishizuki and Yutaka Shibata. Bullmark produced PVC monster character toys and monster- related plastic models. And some ex-employees of Marusan built a new company named \\"Fuji Hobby\\". It took over the military plastic model kit production. Newborn Marusan was also active in PVC toys. They created their own original monster series in 1970 and released Ultraman Ace series mini toys in 1972. Also in plastic model kits, they released small models such as 1:100 scale Japanese fighter series in the early 1970s. In the mid 1970s, Marusan eventually moved primarily into the OEM business of producing toys and parts for others and stopped producing original brand toys and models. In 1981, they developed small elaborate gearboxes suitable for pullback motor, which were used for many companies' products. Under the nostalgia boom, Marusan reproduced their original PVC monster series in 1997. Since then Marusan is continuing production of the old style toys under their own brand.  Products = Plastic models = Marusan products included original molds, molds from other companies such as Pyro and Snap, copies of molds by other companies such as Revell, Monogram, ITC, Aurora and Lindberg. In turn, several other companies used Marusan molds. Marusan also served as the first Revell/Japan in the early 1960s, issuing many Revell kits in the regular Revell box-art with Marusan logo and Japanese language instruction added. After bankruptcy in 1968, molds were acquired by several companies such as Bullmark, Fuji Hobby, Nichimo and Doyusha. US company UPC reboxed and re-issued various Marusan kits in the late 1960s, including copy kits from Monogram, Lindberg etc. Eldon Industries also re-issued Marusan kits as \\"Match Kit\\" in the late 1960s. *1/100 scale aircraft series - mainly WW II era fighters, some large bombers such as B-29, and some post WW-II jet fighters such as F-86 and F-104. *1/50 scale aircraft series - including some fine original models such as F-86D along with copies of 1/48 scale kits of the US companies. *Matchbox series - very small size aircraft models for children. *Various scale aircraft - almost all were copies of other company models. *1/700 scale IJN Combined Fleet series - Japanese battleships, aircraft carriers and heavy cruisers. *1/400 scale IJN Combined Fleet series - Battleship Yamato, Musashi and carrier Shinano. *Tallship series - Nippon Maru, Kaiwo Maru etc. *Torpedo boat series *Various scale boat and ship - ex-Pyro *HO scale armored division series - copies of Roco Minitanks. *1/40 scale military vehicle series - ex-Snap *Movie series - Orion from 2001: A Space Odyssey, Proteus from Fantastic Voyage, Jupiter II from Lost in Space etc. *Figure series - Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Tarzan, Visible Man etc. *Godzilla series - walking Godzilla, Baragon etc. *Ultra Q series - walking Gomess, Peguila etc. *Ultraman series - Jet VTOL, walking Ultraman, Redking etc. *Ultra Seven series - Pointer, Ultra Hawk 1, Ultra Seven etc. *Captain Ultra series = PVC monster toy = *Godzilla series *Ultra Q series *Ultraman series *Ultra Seven series *Captain Ultra series *Kaiju Booska series = Tin Toys = Various type tin toys were produced and exported to the US and Europe in the 1950s.

Mangku Muriati, born in 1967, paints in traditional Balinese form, known as Kamasan- style, where the aesthetic form and most stories relate to the wayang kulit puppet theatre. This form of painting has a very old tradition, associated with the East Javanese kingdom of Majapahit, which flourished in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and helped to propagate Hindu faith across the region – now largely retained in Bali.[Adrian Vickers, Balinese Art: Paintings and Drawings of Bali 1800 - 2010, Tuttle Publishing 2012] It was from the Kamasan village where artists were traditionally recruited to produce classical-style paintings on cloth (or bark cloth) for religious and ceremonial use as well as to decorate the palaces and temples. Mangku Muriati is a daughter of Mangku Mura (1920-1999), who is considered one of the prominent artists of his generation in Kamasan-style painting [1].[Anthony Forge, Balinese Traditional Paintings, Australian Museum, Sydney 1978] As was common practice in artist families, Muriati used to help her father in colouring paintings from an early age, learning the craft of painting. She studied art at the Udayana University in Denpasar, Bali, but after graduating, returned to the traditional style of painting.Adrian Vickers, Balinese Art: Paintings and Drawings of Bali 1800 - 2010, Tuttle Publishing 2012Siobhan Campbell, Kamasan painting at the Australian Museum and beyond, Art Monthly Australia 2011) No. 244 (Oct): 51-54 Working as a Kamasan artist, she joined a small number of Balinese women who work in this style, customarily dominated by men.^ Siobhan Campbell, Collecting Balinese Art: The Forge Collection of the Balinese Paintings at the Australian Museum in Sydney, Unpublished PhD thesis, University of Sydney 2013 In the 1990s, at the age of 32, Muriati became a priestess at her local clan temple in the ward of Banjar Siku. She considers painting and priestly duties as complementary, comparing the role of an artist to a dhalang or puppeteer, who needs an extensive knowledge of characters and stories, ultimately derived from what is considered the sacred scripture - the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. The subjects of her paintings and related commentaries frequently refer to social and political issues in contemporary Bali.

Like the similarly sized D class, they were an attempt to produce a passenger version of the already highly successful F class. Origin and design The G class were ordered by the Canterbury Provincial Council. They were derived from the F class, replacing the first of the three driving axles with a four-wheel bogie. It was hoped that the reduced rigid wheelbase would allow the locomotive to provide higher speed passenger services. The type suffered from lack of weight on the driving axles, a driver stating that \\"it took the 'G' all its time to push its front bogie along, let alone pull a load\\". They were followed by the L Class which were a more successful attempt to produce a faster F Class. Service In the early 1890s the locomotives were progressively transferred to the Picton section, where it was felt that they had been relegated to get rid of them from the busy Hurunui-Bluff section. Their maximum load on the 1 in 37 gradient from Picton was six 4-wheel wagons. Withdrawal and disposal All of the locomotives were withdrawn between 1915 and 1919 and were sold for further service in industry.  References = Bibliography = *Lloyd, W.G.

He specializes in medieval studies, and is President of the International Society for the Study of Medievalism. Biography Richard Utz was born in Amberg, Germany in 1961. He was educated at the University of Regensburg, Germany, and Williams College, USA, where he studied English and German literature and linguistics with Karl Heinz Göller, Maureen Fries, Otto Hietsch, Gerhard Hahn, Sherron Knopp, Ernst von Reusner, and Hans Dieter Schäfer. He received his PhD at Regensburg in 1990 and then garnered a German Academic Exchange Service Teaching Grant to help reestablish English Studies in Dresden, East Germany, after the fall of the Berlin Wall. He has worked as educator and administrator at the University of Northern Iowa (1991–1996; 1998–2007), the University of Tübingen (1996–1998), Western Michigan University (2007–2012), and the University of Bamberg (Johann von Spix International Professorship). Utz was also affiliated with the Medieval Institute at Western Michigan University (2007–2012), and Centre for the Study of the Heritage of Medieval Rituals, an international research center located at the University of Copenhagen and funded by the Danish National Research Foundation (2002-2010), and he founded and co-edited the book series Disputatio (Northwestern UP; later Brepols) and the online journals Medievally Speaking, Prolepsis: The Heidelberg Review of English Studies, and UNIversitas. Utz has been honored with a number of awards for teaching and scholarship, among them the University of Northern Iowa \\"Distinguished Scholar Award\\"David Keiser, “Utz Named 2003 Scholar,” Northern Iowan (18 Feb., 2003), and Gwenne Culpepper, “A Man for the Middle Ages,” University of Northern Iowa Magazine 89.1 (Winter 2005), 14. and the Iowa Board or Regents award for faculty excellence.\\"Katie Hammit, “UNI Professors Receive Regents’ Top Recognition,” Northern Iowan (23 Oct., 2001). Since 2012, he has served as Chair of the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Scholarly work=Literary Nominalism= One of Utz's major contributions to scholarship is the introduction of the paradigm of Literary Nominalism to the study of medieval literature, specifically the works of Geoffrey Chaucer. Grover Furr called Utz \\"perhaps the foremost exponent of the 'paradigm' of Nominalist influence upon late Medieval English literature. His own book and the collection of essays which he edited in 1995, are among the leading causes of the revival of interest by literary scholars in the influence of Nominalism.\\"Grover Furr, \\"Review of H. Keiper, C. Bode, and R. Utz, eds., Nominalism and Literary Discourse,\\" for The Medieval Review, 1999 https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/handle/2022/4672 Utz's posits the possibility of correspondences between late medieval philosophy/religion and literature. More specifically, he finds in certain features of Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde and Canterbury Tales echoes of late medieval nominalist mentalities, a strand of thought cultural historians such as Rosario Assunto, Friedrich Heer, Erwin Panofsky, and Hans Blumenberg count among the decisive factors ushering in the formation of modern Europe. He claims that the author's literary nominalism led him to: construct narratives that center on the ontological status of universals and particulars (with a preference for the latter); focus on the radical contingency of language; challenge allegorical (hence: Neoplatonic ‘realist’) forms of narrative, character, and argument; experiment with non-conclusive, contingent, indeterminate, and fragmentary poetic structures; see a relationship between the God's absolute and ordinate powers on the one hand, and God and humanity, rulers, subjects, and authors on the other. These late medieval nominalist features, Utz proposes, may well be responsible for modern readers' pronounced preference for Chaucer over other, more typically medieval writers. Scholars beholden to more traditional readings of late medieval poetry have been critical of Utz's perhaps too broad application of the paradigm.See, for example, H. R. Andretta, Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde: A Poet's Response to Ockhamism (1998). =Medievalism studies= Utz's second area of specialization is Medievalism Studies, the reception of medieval literature, language, and culture in postmedieval times. One of his additions to this research area is his 2002 study, Chaucer and the Discourse of German Philology, which surveys the reception of Geoffrey Chaucer among German scholars and which the reviewer for Germany's daily, Süddeutsche Zeitung, called an \\"academic thriller.\\"Frank- Rutger Hausmann, Süddeutsche Zeitung (April 23, 2003). \\"Simply for its overview of German scholarship on Chaucer,\\" John M. Hill stated, \\"this book is invaluable, a mother-lode of information and a reminder to many of us that Old and Middle English scholarship as we learned it forty or more years ago is deeply indebted to nineteenth-century German academics and school teachers (even for the first categorizations of language history into old, middle, and modern).\\"\\"Review of Chaucer and the Discourse of German Philology,\\" Medieval Forum (2003) However, perhaps more important than the bio-bibliographic detail, the study demonstrates how (German) philology, rather than being sine ira et studio, was intimately involved with the goals of Germany as an increasingly aggressive nation state. In fact, Utz demonstrates how Germany's actual territorial incursions into Africa, China, and Alsace-Lorraine could be seen as quite similar to German philologists' colonization of academic space via rather bellicose research agendas and methodologies. Finally, Utz provides hitherto unknown information about the scholarship and relationships among some of the most productive medievalists in the German-speaking and Anglo- American world: A.C. Baugh, Henry Bradshaw, Alois Brandl, Ernst Robert Curtius, Ewald Flügel, Frederick James Furnivall, Eugen Kölbing, Wilhelm Hertzberg, Johann August Hermann (John) Koch, Hugo Lange, Victor Langhans, Arnold Schröer, Walter W. Skeat, Bernhard Ten Brink, and Julius Zupitza. More recently, Utz's work has focused on questions of the semantic history of \\"medievalism\\" as well as issues of temporality and technology.See, for example: \\"The Good Corporation? Google's Medievalism and Why It Matters,\\" Studies in Medievalism 23 (2013): 21-28; \\"Coming to Terms with Medievalism: Toward a Conceptual History,\\" European Journal of English Studies 15.2 (2011): 101-13, and \\"Negotiating Heritage: Observations on Semantic Concepts, Temporality, and the Centre of the Study of the Cultural Heritage of Medieval Rituals,\\" Philologie im Netz 58 (2011): 70-87. Collaborating first with Leslie J. Workman and Kathleen Verduin, later with Tom Shippey, Elizabeth Emery, Gwendolyn Morgan, Ed Risden, and Karl Fugelso, Utz shaped the work of the International Society for the Study of Medievalism, as whose President he has served since 2009. =The Manifesto= In 2017, Utz published Medievalism: A Manifesto as the inaugural volume in the ARC Humanities Press book series \\"Past Imperfect\\". Looking back at his career in medieval studies and medievalism, Utz set out to reform the way he and his colleagues think about and practice their academic engagement with medieval culture. His goal is to convince medievalists to abandon their academic habit of communicating exclusively with each other and rather to reconnect with the general public. Paul Sturtevant welcomed the volume as a \\"much-needed call-to-arms to those medievalists still on the fence about working for, among, and with the public\\" and recommends it become \\"required reading for every medieval studies Ph.D., and taped to the door of many a public history professor.\\"Paul Sturtevant, \\"A Public Medievalist’s Little Red Book.\\" The Public Medievalist, 25 April 2017. Jan Alexander von Nahl, similarly, finds value in Utz' \\"holding up a mirror to his own discipline\\" by harnessing the \\"productive uncertainty\\" of the field of medievalism studies.Jan Alexander von Nahl, \\"Zur produktiven Unschärfe des Mediävalismus,\\" literaturkritik.de, 22 June 2017.

Elliot, Arthuriana 27/3 (2017): 83-85; James T. Palmer, \\"On Utz' Medievalism Manifesto.\\" merowingianworld, 4 May 2017. describes the value of the volume more critically, claiming that \\"some of the more pointed comments about the nature of the profession (particularly those about the “protection of tenure” and the “protective ivory tower walls”) seem to have been written by someone occupying a very comfortable chair\\" and that the arguments made suffer from too much \\"brevity and concision\\". =Bruce Chatwin= Utz is an expert on British essayist, journalist, art connoisseur, globetrotter, and novelist Bruce Chatwin (1940–1989), publishing entries in the Literary Encyclopediahttp://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID;=837 on all of Chatwin's books, including (in what Peter McLachlin called \\"a Borgesian coincidence\\"\\"The Psychopathology of Collecting: Bruce Chatwin's Utz) on Chatwin's 1989 novella, Utz, and reading On the Black Hill (1982) as an example of Utopian autobiografiction.“Das Zwillingspaar aus Chatwinshire: Bruce Chatwins antibinäre Utopie.” In: Paare und Paarungen. Festschrift für Werner Wunderlich. Ed. Ulrich Müller (Stuttgart: Heinz, 2004), 343-53. =Academic leadership= Utz has published articles on academic leadership issues, discussing nepotism during faculty hires, diversity and inclusion in administrative hires, tenure and promotion, traditional notions of English departments and the humanities, isolationist tendencies in the German academy, jargon in Strategic Planning, and open access to scholarship.See his \\"Fit for Germany?,\\" Inside Higher Ed, 16 September 2013; \\"The Diversity Question and the Administrative-Job Interview,\\" Chronicle of Higher Education, 18 January 2017; \\"The English Prof as Entrepreneur,\\" Inside Higher Ed, 4 March 2013; \\"The Trouble with English,\\" The Chronicle of Higher Education, 3 January 2013; \\"Quo vadis, English Studies?\\" Philologie im Netz 69 (2014): 93-100; \\"Anatomy of an Academic Genre: Advice for Chairs on How to Write a Tenure and Promotion Letter,\\" Inside Higher Ed 13 October, 2020; \\"Against Adminspeak,\\" Chronicle of Higher Education, 24 June, 2020; and \\"Beyond Consanguinity,\\" Inside Higher Ed, 24 March 2010; \\"Open Access in the Academy\\" https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/52790 (accessed November 12, 2014); and \\"The Diversity Question and the Administrative-Job Interview,\\" Chronicle of Higher Education, 18 January 2017. He is critical of disciplinary silos, finds synergies between the humanities and social sciences on the one hand, and engineering, computing, and the natural sciences on the other, and favors the public humanities.See Piotr Toczyski, \\"Co studiować, aby być mądrym i bogatym.

The route begins at an intersection with VT 118 (Main Street) in the town of Montgomery and runs through the Green Mountains of Vermont past Jay Peak to a junction with VT 101 in the town of Troy. The route was first designated by the state of Vermont in 1959 from the town of Jay to Troy, with the piece in the town of Montgomery being added five years later. In 1972, the segment in Westfield and Jay that connected the two segments was added to the state highway system.  Route description  VT 242 approaching the junction with VT 118 in Montgomery Center VT 242 begins at an intersection with VT 118 (Main Street) in the hamlet of Montgomery Center (in the town of Montgomery just north of the western terminus of VT 58\\\\. Running northeast through Montgomery Center, VT 242 runs along Mountain Road, a two- lane residential street through the eastern side of the hamlet. The route soon bends east and leaves the hamlet, turning east through the town of Montgomery, into a mix of dense woods and residences. The route winds east for a distance, reaching a junction with Minglewood Road, where VT 242 turns northeast running along the base of Big Jay Mountain. At the junction with Christmas Road, VT 242 turns northeast and crosses into Orleans County and into the town of Westfield. VT 242 continues northeast through Westfield, dropping the Mountain Road moniker as it runs along Jay Peak. The route passes through dense woods along Jay Peak, running up the mountainside. After making a northwestern jog, VT 242 turns northeast, passing Access Road, which connects drivers to Jay Peak Ski Resort. Winding northeast, the route parallels Access Road, which soon meets Shortcut, which connects back to VT 242\\\\. Now in the town of Jay, VT 242 runs northeast past some residences before bending east to Graham Hill Road. At that junction, the route turns northeast again, reaching the hamlet of Jay. Through Jay, VT 242 passes a local restaurant and store at Cross Road. Leaving Jay, the route soon turns southeast into the town of Troy. In Troy, VT 242 goes east and reaches a junction with VT 101\\\\. This junction marks the eastern terminus of VT 242.  History  VT 242 was first designated as two state-maintained highways, known as the Jay-Troy State Highway (which was long) and the Montgomery State Highway ( and consisted only of the route in the town of Montgomery). By petition, the state of Vermont re-designated the section between Jay and Troy as VT 242 in 1959. The section through the town of Montgomery was added on May 1, 1964. The remaining segment, located in the towns of Westfield and Jay, was added to the state highway system by executive order in 1972.

The river mouth is at the Catumbela Estuary on the Atlantic Ocean at Catumbela, between Lobito and Benguela, and from where it rises in the hills of Cassoco. The Catumbela supplies water to the city of Lobito. The mouth of the Catumbela was noted as a green vegetated region surrounded by barren land along the coast and a couple miles inland where it cuts a gorge through bare mountains.

Findlay, Richard Holmes Laurie, 1883, p. 767 Its main tributaries are the Cuíva River on the right bank, and Cubal River on the left bank. The Catumbela was a center of the slave trade to the New World until it was banned in 1836. Portugal then built a fort at the river mouth and a small community grew up in the area. Exports of palm oil, rubber, serviçais (indentured servants), rum, sugar and other goods traded from further inland supported a small town with several hundred Portuguese colonists. The Cassaquel sugar company, founded in 1913, and later called Primeiro de Maio operated on the banks of the river and would become the largest sugar producer in Angola. It closed in 1990 but at its peak employed over 5,000 who lived in dozens of company towns.Company Towns: Labor, Space, and Power Relations Across Time and Continents, Marcelo J. Borges, Susana B.

History The current campus was previously the Haberdashers' Aske's School for Girls The school, operated by the Japanese Ministry of Education, was established with the financial involvement of Japanese companies.White, p. 89. It first opened as a supplementary school, with four teachers and 20 students, in the Convent of Our Lady Sion in September 1965. It was upgraded to an official supplementary school in 1974 when the Japanese Ministry of Education sent its first teacher; it had done so due to an increase in the student body. The day school was established on 18 June 1976. The Japanese Ministry of Education had sent Katsuya Tanaka, the first headmaster, to London the previous April.\\"School Outline\\" (). Japanese School in London. June 24, 2001. Retrieved on April 24, 2016. In October 1976 the school had 79 students, with 54 in primary school and 25 in junior high school. That month it moved to several buildings on the property of the Japan Club and the Japan Embassy Information Service Centre. In April 1977 the school moved to a new location, the current North Bridge House School in Camden,\\"Which School?\\" Truman & Knightley Educational Trust, 1989. p.

In 1987 the day school had 657 students. In 1991 the school had 980 students.\\"Britain: Japanese Spoken Here.\\" The Economist. 14 September 1991. Volume 320, Issue 7724, p. 67. . CODEN ECSTA3.

It caters for 980 pupils--up from 657 in 1987--and is staffed by Japanese teachers on three-year secondments from the Ministry of Education in Tokyo.\\" In 1999 the Saturday school had 1,602 students and 82 teachers at three sites, making made it the largest of the eight Japanese Saturday schools in the United Kingdom. At the time the Saturday school had three sites: Acton, Camden, and Croydon. It was a site of filming for the 2009 film An Education. Academic Standards The most recent 2014 Ofsted report graded the day school as 'a school that requires improvement'. While the behaviour and safety of pupils was rated as 'good', leadership and management, quality of teaching and achievement of pupils were all cited as requiring improvement. Student demographics In 2001 the day school had 583 students. In 2012 most Japanese living in London sent their children to either the Japanese school or to local schools. In 2003 Paul White, author of \\"The Japanese in London: From transience to settlement?\\", wrote that \\"even company movers do not necessarily put their children through the Japanese schooling system in London\\" and several British and international schools in London cater to Japanese students. =Saturday school demographics= In 1999 the Saturday school had 1,602 students, including 1,152 students in 48 elementary school classes, 258 students in 12 junior high school slasses, and 93 senior high school students in four classes. That year, the average Saturday school class sizes were 24 pupils per class in elementary school, 21.5 pupils per class in junior high school, and 23.25 pupils per class in the senior high school. In 1999 within the Saturday school there were 98 children of mixed British and Japanese heritage who came from mostly Anglophone homes. The Saturday school provided \\"basic\\" classes for these pupils, with those students divided into five classes. Teachers In 1991 teachers of the day school were sent by the Ministry of Education of Japan for secondments (terms of temporary transfer) of three years. In 1999 the Saturday school had 82 teachers, the majority of whom were women.Aizawa, p. 28. In regards to the Saturday school the head teacher and senior teachers originate from Japan while the school recruited other teachers locally, including postgraduate students studying in the United Kingdom and housewives. Curriculum The Saturday school uses approved textbooks from the Japanese Ministry of Education. Transport The school has a system of buses that picks up and drops off Japanese students living in various areas in London. Funding The school is primarily funded by tuition fees, though it also receives a subsidy from the Japanese Ministry of Education and donations from Japanese companies. The school, like other British independent schools, has a charitable status.

Plot  Tamy is a dreamy girl, who has \\"Poetic Schizophrenia,\\" a rare personality disorder which makes her imagine that her life is a film plot and that she is the star. In real life, she is an ordinary girl, who lives with her cousin Ayala. They both fall in love with Johney Rocker, a hit rock star, who prefers Ayala, and Tamy finds it difficult to get over him. At some point, when Ayala makes Tamy very angry, the director of the film suddenly enters, fires Ayala and casts a new Ayala instead. The story continues as if nothing happened, but the crisis between the girls aggravates, and from time to time, when daily events are hard for Tamy to handle, she \\"stops the film\\" and enters her imaginary world in the shape of the director, the actors behind the characters, sound equipment etc. And so it seems that we are watching a film inside a film, but as the story continues we realize that what seems real, the backstage of the movie, is in fact the wild imagination and schizophrenic mind of Tamy.

Song controversy In the early '60s, the BBC banned the song and wouldn't allow British radio stations to play it. The controversy arose not from the fact that it was a religious song, but because the censors interpreted the song as suggesting women were created simply to be sexual beings, and the BBC felt something that was considered blasphemous should not air to avoid controversy.

The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was responsible for the defence of the northern perimeter of the ANZAC beach-head, holding a sector from the position known as Walker's Top down the ridge line to the sea. Part of this defence line was formed by No.1 and No.2 Posts, isolated positions in the far north that could only be approached in safety during the hours of darkness. Near the end of May 1915, the Turks started constructing a new position just inland from No.2 Post, that if left to be completed would cause problems for the New Zealanders. Therefore, it was decided to assault and capture the post. After the position was captured, it was named No.3 Post, and the New Zealanders settled in and attempted to improve its defences. The same night, the Turks counter-attacked. Surrounded and cut off from the rest of the brigade, running short of ammunition and supplies, the defending 9th (Wellington East Coast) Squadron held out for twenty-eight hours until relieved, and beat off several attempts to break through their lines. When the squadron was eventually relieved it was decided the post was untenable, and it was abandoned the same night. The New Zealand Mounted Brigade's casualties during the battle were forty-two dead and 109 wounded. The exact number of Turkish casualties is not known but was around two hundred men. The New Zealand brigade went on to fight in the Battle of Chunuk Bair and the Battle of Hill 60, and was then evacuated from the peninsula before the campaign ended in December 1915. Background Anzac Cove in 2004, showing the North Beach, The Sphinx, and on the left rear Walker's Ridge stretching down to the sea. This is where the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade were deployed. =ANZAC landings= On 25 April, at the start of the Gallipoli Campaign, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) landed at what later became known as Anzac Cove. Included in the landings was the New Zealand and Australian Division, but the division had been forced to leave part of its strength, including the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, behind in Egypt. The commanders believed there would be no requirement or opportunities for mounted troops on the peninsula. However, heavy casualties, and the lack of any other reinforcements, forced them to reconsider the decision, and the mounted troops were later dispatched to Gallipoli to serve in a dismounted role.Powles 1928, p.22 =New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade= Under the command of Brigadier-General Andrew Russell,Kinloch 2005, p.32 the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was raised in August 1914 and consisted of three regiments of mounted infantry.Kinloch 2005, p.29 While the brigade had an establishment of 1,940 men,Kinloch 2005, p.30 when dismounted its rifle strength was only the equivalent of an infantry battalion. Each of the brigade's regiments was formed from three squadrons, each of 158 men organised into a headquarters and four troops.Wilkie 1924, p.3 When the brigade arrived in Egypt, it came under the command of the newly formed New Zealand and Australian Division.Powles 1928, p.12 In April 1915, the division's infantry units left Egypt for an undisclosed destination, and it was not until 1 May that the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade learned about the Gallipoli landings. Four days later the brigade received news that it would also deploy, as reinforcements, to Gallipoli, but in a dismounted role without their horses. They arrived off the Gallipoli peninsula on 12 May, and disembarked at Anzac Cove.Waite 1919, p.134 The next day, the brigade moved into the front line on the northern left flank, relieving the Royal Naval Brigade. Their trenches stretched from the Aegean Sea to Walker's Ridge, and included two outposts, No.1 Post and No.2 Post.Powles 1928, p.27 The latter position was the beach-head's most northern position, situated only from Chatham's Post, which was the southernmost point.Waite 1919, p.136 The outlying position of the two posts meant that movement between them and the main lines could only be undertaken safely at night.Powles 1928, p.29 The brigade deployed with the Canterbury Mounted Rifles on the left, the Auckland Mounted Rifles in the centre, and the Wellington Mounted Rifles on the right.Wilkie 1924, pp.15–18Nicol 1921, p.33 Turkish machine-gunners with German officers at Gallipoli =Turkish forces= The First World War Ottoman Turkish Army was badly underestimated by the Allies. During the war it would defeat forces from the British, French and Russian armies.Erickson 2007, p.1 Before the landings Gallipoli was defended by several divisions, based on infantry battalion strong-points overlooking potential landing beaches.Erickson 2007, p.16 By April 1915, the Turks had 82 fixed and 230 mobile artillery pieces on the peninsula.Erickson 2007, p.18 In May 1915, the Turkish force that would confront the New Zealanders was provided by the 19th Division,Erickson 2007, pp.21–23 comprising the 57th, 72nd and 77th Infantry Regiments,Carver 2004, p.23 all under the command of Colonel Mustafa Kemal.Kinloch 2005, p.149 Kemal was noted as \\"the most imaginative, most successful officer to fight on either side\\" during the Gallipoli Campaign.Fewster, Basarin, Basarin 2003, p.2 How the Turks viewed the invasion can be judged by Kemal's orders to his troops following the initial landings; \\"Men, I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die. In the time that it takes us to die, other forces and commanders can come and take our place.\\"Klees 2002, p.313 Virtually all the Turkish Army commanders, down to company commander level, were very experienced, being veterans of the Balkan Wars. But their command structure was weaker at the non-commissioned officer (NCO) level, with only one NCO in each company.Erickson 2007, p.26 One advantage that the Turkish Army had over the New Zealanders, at the time, was their hand grenades, which were not used by the British forces.Waite 1919, p.149 No.3 Post=Capture= The ANZAC beach-head After an abortive Turkish attack in early May, from the middle of the month the New Zealanders observed their opponents improving their defensive positions. One position in particular was started overnight on 26/27 May, at the foot of the ridge that led down to No.2 Post and only from it. It gave the New Zealanders cause for concern, and therefore it was decided that the position must be captured and denied to the Turks.Powles 1928, p.36 Plans for the assault were formed, and the task was given to the 1st (Canterbury Yeomanry Cavalry) Squadron of the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, commanded by Major Percy Acton-Adams. On 28 May, the squadron was concentrated at No.2 Post and at 22:00 left the post to capture the Turkish position. By 23:30, after advancing along the ridge, they arrived and with only slight opposition drove off the twenty Turkish defenders at a cost of one dead and five wounded. They were followed up by the 6th (Manawatu) Squadron from the Wellington Mounted Rifles, who carried entrenching tools to improve the defences and would then garrison the position, now named No.3 Post.Wilkie 1924, p.27Kinloch 2005, p.148 The 6th Squadron, who had orders to \\"hold the post until relieved\\", started constructing defences against a Turkish counter-attack, which would not be easy as the post was surrounded on three sides by the Turks. After sunrise on 29 May the squadron was in full view of the Turks and they were engaged by small arms and artillery fire. They were forced to take cover and stop building defences. That night at 21:00 the 6th Squadron was relieved by three troops (nine officers and ninety-three other ranks) of the 9th (Wellington East Coast) Squadron, Wellington Mounted Rifles, commanded by Major Selwyn Chambers.Powles 1928, p.28 =Defence= Chambers and his second in command, Captain Charles Spragg, immediately set about constructing a defensive trench across the post, and strengthening its other defences. But by now the Turks, from the 72nd Infantry Regiment,Bean 1941, p.195 about 1,000-strong, had managed to use the terrain and darkness to close in on the position. At 22:00 Chambers reported that the position was under attack and surrounded, and at 23:35 the telephone line to headquarters was cut by the Turks. The area in front of No.3 Post was in a gully and out of sight to the defenders, so they had to climb on the trench parapet to engage the Turks. This tactic worked well, and they broke up the Turkish assault, causing the attackers some casualties. The Turks did not withdraw far, and crept up to the edge of the New Zealanders' trench during the night. They then threw hand grenades into the New Zealanders' position. At the same time, small arms fire from the surrounding Turkish positions pinned the New Zealanders down.Wikie 1919, pp.27–29Powles 1928, p.40 The open coastal terrain where No.1 and No.2 Posts were located Just after midnight the New Zealanders sent the 2nd (Wellington West Coast) Squadron, commanded by Major James McGregor Elmslie, forward to reinforce the 9th Squadron. But by itself the 2nd Squadron was not strong enough to break through the Turkish lines and reach the post, and at times they had to engage in close quarter fighting in the thick scrub. Eventually the 2nd Squadron had to form their own defensive position in the ground between No.2 and No.3 Posts.Wilkie 1919, p.29 At 03:00, just before dawn, Spragg took command of the trench in the southern sector of No.3 Post, opposite where the Turks appeared to be gathering their forces to assault the post. He successfully deployed his men so that when the attack began, it was met and broken up by the New Zealanders' small arms fire. But by 03:30 the post was under sustained Turkish rifle and grenade attack and the relieving 2nd Squadron was still held up on a ridge to the south of the post. Between them and No.3 Post was a strong Turkish force which had dug in and were in communication with the Turkish attackers in the gully to the north of the post. However, the 2nd Squadron could now bring their own small arms fire onto the Turks attacking No.3 Post, making them keep their heads down. At daylight Elmslie led a troop in an attack which captured a Turkish trench to the left of the post. At 06:30 communications were re-established with No.3 Post by using signal flags, and Allied artillery were able to bring harassing fire onto the Turkish communications trenches. But by now the defenders were running short of supplies, especially ammunition, and no one could be spared to look after the wounded, who had to see to themselves.Wilkie 1919, p.30 The 6th Squadron, commanded by Major Charles Dick, were also sent forward to support the 2nd Squadron's attempt to break through to the post. Advancing along the ridge from No.2 Post, they reached a position on the open plateau to the north of No.3 Post, but neither of the relieving squadrons could break through the Turkish lines, and were confronted by heavy Turkish fire from the surrounding higher ground. They were blocked by the sheer number of Turkish troops. Around noon the Turks undermined and blew up part of the trench at No.3 Post, which they then occupied. Turkish attacks continued all day, and they brought into action a mountain artillery gun from a nearby position. It was now estimated that around 3,000 Turkish troops were involved in the assault on No.3 Post. Men of the Wellington Mounted Rifles at Gallipoli Unable to break through to No.3 Post during the day, the New Zealanders decided to wait for nightfall to make another attempt. At the same time the Canterbury Mounted Rifles were warned they would have to provide two squadrons to take over the defence, once the 9th Squadron had been relieved. During this time the Turks had not given up their attempts to recapture the post. At 19:00 Chambers signalled that the \\"repeated bombing of the trenches on the northern side of the post had resulted in a portion of the trenches being damaged, to such an extent that he could no longer prevent the enemy from getting in.\\"Wilkie 1919, pp.31–32 This was followed ten minutes later with a message that the Turks had occupied the trenches in the north of the post. Around the same time the 6th Squadron, advancing from the south, had managed to get to within of the post before being pinned down. Even though they now had fire support from a mountain artillery battery and a British destroyer, HMS Rattlesnake, they were unable to advance any further. As darkness approached the Turkish attacks lessened, and at 22:30, covered by the 2nd and 6th Squadrons, the 10th (Nelson) Squadron and two troops from the 8th (South Canterbury) Squadron from the Canterbury Mounted Rifles managed to break through to No.3 Post.Waite 1919, p.150 By 23:00 the 9th Squadron's survivors had been evacuated and the Canterbury Regiment had taken over the defence of the post. An hour later the 2nd and 6th Squadrons were withdrawn back to the brigade lines.Wilkie 1919, p.32 Shortly after the relief, it was decided that the post was untenable and it was abandoned.Powles 1928, p.37 While the Canterburys were withdrawing south towards No.1 Post they were attacked by the Turks. The New Zealanders turned and opened fire, then counter-attacked in a bayonet charge, forcing the Turks to withdraw before re-occupying No.3 Post. The 9th Squadron had held out for twenty-eight hours, during which the brigade had lost forty-two men killed and 109 wounded, the vast majority from 9th Squadron. Turkish casualties were around two hundred men.Waite 1924, pp.32–33Wilkie 1919, p.33 Aftermath The battle for No.3 Post seemed a major event to those involved, but in General Ian Hamilton's dispatches the fight only received a brief mention: \\"On 28 May, at 9 p.m., a raid was made on a Turkish post overlooking the beach 1,200 yards north of Kaba Tepe, H.M.S. \\"Rattlesnake\\" co-operating. A party of 50 rifles rushed the post, killing or capturing the occupants. A similar raid was made against an enemy trench to the left of our line which cost the Turks 200 casualties, as was afterwards ascertained.\\" The battle for No.3 Post cost the New Zealanders forty-two dead and 109 wounded. The brigade fought another two battles at Gallipoli: the Battle of Chunuk Bair, and the Battle of Hill 60. Their involvement in these battles proved costly, and in September 1915, with a strength of only 249 men, they left the peninsula for the rest camp on the island of Lemnos.Waite 1919, p.261 During the campaign, 4,000 men served in the brigade; 727 of those were killed and 1,239 wounded, which equates to a casualty rate of almost fifty per cent.Kinloch 2005, p.15 Amongst the dead were Chambers – the commander of the 9th Squadron – and Elmslie of the 6th Squadron. Both survived the battle for No.3 Post, but not the campaign, and were killed in action in August 1915 during the Battle of Chunuk Bair. Like many other New Zealanders, neither have a known grave, and they are therefore commemorated on the Chunuk Bair Memorial. The adjacent Commonwealth War Graves Commission Chunuk Bair Cemetery has 632 graves of which only ten men have been identified. During the 260 days of the Gallipoli Campaign, a total of 2,721 New Zealand soldiers were killed and another 4,852 wounded, out of the total 8,556 New Zealanders who took part. The exact number of Turkish casualties at Gallipoli is not known, but has been estimated at 87,000 dead, from a total of around 250,000 casualties.Fewster, Basarin, Basarin 2003, p.6 The war between the British and Ottoman Turkish Empires ended on 31 October 1918, following the signing of the Armistice of Mudros.Waite 1919, p.295 In November, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles were selected to be part of the Allied force of occupation for the Dardanelles peninsula. During their time there they took the opportunity to look for and bury the brigade's war dead.Waite 1919, p.298Powles 1928, p.245 Kemal, the commander of the Turkish 19th Division, survived the war.

Sarat Chandra was intimately connected with the Ramakrishna Order throughout his life and even before the return of Swami Vivekananda from West in 1897 he had been associated with the old monastery in Alambazar and with the direct disciples of Sri Ramakrishna. He was also a Sanskrit scholar and was a postmaster by profession in the British Government service.  Early life  Sarat Chandra was born to Ramkamal Chakravarty and Vidhumukhi Devi in the village Kotapada in the district Faridpur in erstwhile Bengal province (now Bangladesh) on the Hindu holy day of Sivaratri on 21 February 1868. The parents were humble but pious and educated. Sarat Chandra was the eldest son of the family. His mother was well versed in scripture and from his parents he got his interest in spirituality. He grew up as an orthodox Brahmin owing to the prevalent customs of the society. However he was known to be kind and of charitable disposition at an early age. = Education = In 1873 he passed school final examination. He loved Sanskrit most. In 1882 he passed Entrance examination and earned a scholarship of Rs 10/-. He joined Jagannath College in Dhaka. His penned his first poem about this time, called Kavya Kusumanjali, in 1882-83. He passed First Arts (F.A) in 1883 and joined Metropolitan Insititution run by Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar in Calcutta. Mahendranath Gupta, better known as \\"M\\", the author of The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna was a teacher in this institute. However, there is no recorded history as to whether Sarat Chandra met \\"M\\" or any of the students of \\"M\\" who later became the direct disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, at this time. He passed Bachelor of Arts (B.A) with honours in Sanskrit. He was the first graduate from his village. = Marriage and Career = Sarat Chandra, according to the prevalent norms and culture, was married to Mokshadayini, at an early age, and had a son and three daughters from the marriage. In order to support his family, he, side by side along with his pursuing of his education, became a private tutor of a local landlord. He bore the educational expenses of his brother Ramesh Chandra who was also a brilliant student. Subsequently, after graduation he joined the Government service under the then British rule, as a Deputy Post Master and continued with the same profession for the rest of his life. His biographer states that he was unjustly denied promotion throughout his career by the British officials owing to his uprightness and dignity in not acceding to their whims. He began his career as Deputy Post Master at Barrackpore Post Office page 24. During his service he had to work in many places in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. = Introduction to Ramakrishna Vivekananda ideology = Sarat Chandra came in contact with Durga Charan Nag, also called Nag Mahasaya, a foremost householder disciple of Sri Ramakrishna in the early stage of his career. The latter introduced him to the ideology of Sri Ramakrishna and took him to Dakshineswar temple and to Alambazar Math where he met many direct monastic disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, like Swami Brahmananda, Swami Turiyananda, Swami Ramakrishnananda, Swami Niranjanananda and Swami Premananda. He, being already well versed with Vedanta philosophy, was attracted by the holy life led by the monks, their erudition and their sincere aspiration after realization or direct perception of the Truth. He joined in the celebrations of the birth anniversaries of Sri Ramakrishna by the monks of the monastery and composed a hymn called Sri Ramakrishna Stavamala.  Swami Vivekananda and his influence  Sarat Chandra met Swami Vivekananda in Priyanath Mukherjee's house in Baghbazar three or four days after the Swami set foot on Calcutta in 20 February 1897.Diary of a Disciple Sarat was introduced to the Swami by Swami Turiyananda. Swami Vivekananda conversed with him in Sanskrit on Nag Mahasaya. After that he met Swami Vivekananda many times, initially in the Garden House of Gopal Lal Seal and Alambazar Math, and later in the newly established Belur Math, and became intimate with him who would affectionately call him as \\"Bangal\\", an epithet used for people from East Bengal. In May 1897 he was formally initiated by Swami Vivekananda. The Swami discoursed him on many topics of Vedanta. During the initial days of the Belur Math, Sarat Chandra attended many critical functions like the consecration of the Math premises with the urn containing the ashes of Sri Ramakrishna and the birthday celebration of Sri Ramakrishna in 1898. He was also well acquainted with the famous poet, playwright and a disciple of Sri Ramakrishna, Girish Chandra Ghosh.Swami Vivekananda, The Friend of All, Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, 1991, page 55 He composed a book of hymns in Sanskrit on Sri Ramakrishna during one of the birth day celebrations. He met Swami Vivekananda for the last time in June 1902, a week before the latter died. During this period he often cooked and discussed on many spiritual topics. Most of the conversations which are of interest to people interested in Vedanta philosophy and its interpretation by Swami Vivekananda, are captured in the Diary of a Disciple. He was also present when Ramakrishna Mission was formally founded in the house of Balaram Bose on 1 May 1897.  Influence of Nag Mahasaya  The person who influenced Sarat Chandra most after Swami Vivekananda was Durga Charan Nag, a saint and a householder disciple of Sri Ramakrishna. Sarat Chandra also wrote the only biography on Nag Mahasaya, called Life of Nag Mahasaya. He was present by the bedside of Nag Mahasaya when the latter died.Life of Nag Mahasaya  Later years  In the course of his service Sarat had to travel throughout the province of Bengal and he spread the ideals of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda in the places that he visited. He retired in 1933 from Head Post Office in Cuttack, Orissa. Sarat Chandra composed Sri Ramakrishna Panchali based on the life of Sri Ramakrishna. The revolutionaries of Bengal, most famous among them being Subhas Chandra Bose had read Swami Vivekananda's conversations with his disciple on spiritual matters and drew their inspiration from the book. The bard of Bengal Mukunda Das, a famous poet, ballad singer, patriot and lyricist, was a friend of Sarat Chandra and sang the songs composed by the latter during theatrical performances in the villages. Sarat also started many devotees' association, study circles, societies in Ramakrishna Vivekananda ideology, wherever he was posted during his service. He maintained close contact with the monks of the Belur Math. Sri Sarada Devi, the spiritual consort of Ramakrishna had stayed in his house in Burdwan. He also established the Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama in Midnapore, Bengal, in the house of the local landlord or Zamindar, during his stay in Midnapore as the chief executive of the Post Office there. Between 1914 and 1921 many direct disciples of Sri Ramakrishna visited his house. among them were Golap Ma, Yogin Ma, Swami Subodhananda, Swami Adbhutananda, Swami Saradananda and Gauri Ma. After retirement in 1933 he spent several years in Calcutta and he suffered from poor eyesight. He wrote a commentary on Brahma Sutrasas he was directed by Swami Vivekananda to do so. The work was edited by Swami Shuddhananda, another direct disciple of Swami Vivekananda. The last four years of his life, from 1939 to 1942 were spent in Baharampur in Murshidabad district of Bengal and also in his native village. Many dignitaries and monks of Ramakrishna Order used to visit his house. His last few years were spent in silent contemplation and devotion to a marble plaque of Sri Ramakrishna presented to him by Swami Vivekananda. In spite of his ailments he did not miss an opportunity to spread the message of Sri Ramakrishna and Vivekananda whenever he received an invitation to do so on special occasions like birth anniversaries. He suffered from asthma and died on 23 August 1942.

The charismatic Armenian conductor’s reputation with fellow musicians and critics alike flows from the fluidity of his technical skills, the intensity with which he shapes and communicates musical ideas, the intelligence of his programming, and the spiritual richness and depth of his interpretations. Acclaimed for his achievements at home and increasingly in demand on the international stage, he continues to serve as Artistic Director and Principal Conductor of the Armenian State Symphony Orchestra and has been Principal Conductor of the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra since September 2019. Sergey Smbatyan’s development as man and musician owes much to the Armenian State Symphony Orchestra, which he founded in 2006 as an eighteen-year-old student. He has overseen its transformation since from youth ensemble into a fully-fledged professional orchestra, ranked among Armenia’s best. At the start of 2020 conductor and orchestra undertook a landmark eight-concert European tour, complete with debut appearances at Vienna’s Musikverein, the Berlin Philharmonie, Salzburg’s Großes Festspielhaus, the Barbican Hall in London, Moscow’s Zaryadye Concert Hall, the Gasteig Munich, Stuttgart’s Beethoven Hall and Prague’s Rudolfinum. SeenandHeard International.com hailed the orchestra’s Barbican concert as ‘a fabulous evening’ and praised Smbatyan’s orchestra as ‘a fine ensemble with no weak sections’. Orchestra and conductor, in company with solo violinist Nemanja Radulovic, make their first full tour of the UK in January and February 2021. During recent seasons Sergey Smbatyan has extended his career, working as guest conductor with the Russian Philharmonic Orchestra, Sinfonia Varsovia, the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, the Dresden Philharmonic, Prague Radio Symphony Orchestra and, among others, the Orchestra of the Komische Oper Berlin. He made his debut with the Malta Philharmonic in the summer of 2017, led the orchestra on tour to prestigious venues in Germany and Austria the following year and was invited soon after to become its Principal Conductor. During the 2020-21 season he is set to join the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra for a European tour, including concerts at the Kurhaus in Wiesbaden and the Musikverein in Vienna. His schedule also includes dates with the Malta Philharmonic, the Russian National Orchestra, the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, the Deutsche Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfaltz and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the 2021 Malta International Music Festival. Smbatyan will conduct the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra on its first UK tour in September 2021, presenting ten concerts at leading venues in company with Maxim Vengerov as soloist, and make his debut with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra soon after. Sergey Smbatyan’s approach to programming recognises the importance of creating harmonious combinations of works by different composers as well as the vital need to refresh the repertoire with attractive new music. “I am led by an impulse to share great music with audiences and keep our wonderful collective arts culture thriving,” he observes. Over the past two decades, he has explored a vast range of repertoire, embracing everything from masterworks of the western symphonic literature and neglected treasures to compelling scores by Armenian and other Eastern European composers, many of them commissioned by or specially written for him. “I’ve always sought to combine the eastern and western musical traditions together when programming concerts for the Armenian State Symphony Orchestra, whilst also presenting new music to audiences. I want to introduce other orchestras and their audiences to works from eastern musical traditions and show how we are all connected by the common emotions and feelings that music inspires.” In addition to his work as conductor, Smbatyan has also made significant contributions to the arts in Armenia as founder of four music festivals and creator of the annual Khachaturian International Competition’s conducting category. The remit of his festivals, represented in the titles of the Armenian Composing Art Festival, the Khachaturian International Festival, the “Armenia” International Music Festival and the Contemporary Classics Composers’ Festival, reflects the high value Smbatyan places on new work, encouraging young composers and performers and building on the great legacy of classical music’s past. Since his appointment as Artistic Director of the Aram Khachaturian International Competition in 2016, he has incorporated artificial intelligence (AI) into the annual event’s third and final round and overseen a virtual edition of the competition in 2020. Armed with the experience of building a symphony orchestra from scratch, Sergey Smbatyan has created four other orchestras in recent years. In 2017 he founded the 24/04 Orchestra to commemorate the centenary of the Armenian Genocide and the “Generation of Independence” All- Armenian Choir and Orchestra to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of Armenia’s independence from the Soviet Union. He also founded the UNICEF Children’s Chamber Orchestra, dedicated to the twentieth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Pan-Armenian Symphony Orchestra, an initiative intended to unite Armenians around the world. The remit of his work as educator and innovator extends to DasA, a high school- based project that offers students hands-on experience of making classical music. Smbatyan’s determination to engage with young people and win new audiences for classical music attracted international attention in October 2019 when he conducted the WCIT World Orchestra in the first ever concert of music written by AI. The project, presented in Yerevan by the Armenian State Symphony Orchestra and the World Congress of Information Technology (WCIT), united musicians from the ASSO and fellow players from the fourteen other countries that had previously hosted the Congress. Born in Yerevan into a family of musicians in 1987, Sergey Smbatyan showed exceptional musical promise at an early age. He received his first violin lessons from his grandmother, the violinist and renowned pedagogue Tatiana Hayrapetyan, continued his studies at the Komitas State Conservatory of Yerevan and Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory and received advanced lessons from Bagrat Vardanyan and Zakhar Bron. His innate leadership skills and entrepreneurial spirit were already apparent in 2005 when he established the State Youth Orchestra of Armenia; following his graduation four years later, he worked tirelessly to build his ensemble of young musicians into the Armenian State Symphony Orchestra. In addition to his training in the great Russian tradition of violin playing, Smbatyan flourished as a conductor with his Yerevan-based orchestra. He developed his skills and experience while studying for a PhD in fine arts at the Institute of Arts of the Armenian National Academy of Sciences and as a postgraduate student at London’s Royal Academy of Music, where he gained invaluable insights into the art and craft of conducting from Sir Colin Davis. During his student years in the UK, he conducted the Philharmonia Orchestra and Maxim Vengerov in fundraising concerts for the Prince’s Trust at Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace and made his debut with the London Symphony Orchestra at LSO St Luke’s. Sergey Smbatyan’s list of awards and prizes includes the title of Honoured Artist of the Republic of Armenia, presented by the President of the Republic of Armenia in recognition for his promotion of Armenian music and culture, and first prize in the conducting category of the inaugural Debut Berlin competition at the Berlin Philharmonie. In 2014 he became the youngest ever worker in the field of the arts and the first Armenian to be appointed Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Ministry of Culture.

Nash, (September 9, 1869 – July 5, 1902), known informally as Harry Nash, was an Arizona pioneer who served as a Sergeant in Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders during the Spanish–American War. Later, he was one of the first Thomasites sent by the U.S. government to establish an English language-based public education system in the Philippines in the early 1900s. Early life Henry W. Nash was born in Mount Sterling, Indiana, the son of Louise Walden Nash and disgraced Civil War veteran George W. Nash.Switzerland, IN 1880 Federal Census His father had been a Lieutenant in Company E of the First Missouri Cavalry, but was arrested for murder in 1862 and escaped during his trial. A few months after his escape, he enlisted in the \\"California Hundred\\" of the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry under an assumed name. After attempting to seek a pardon for his murder charge, he was re-arrested and dishonorably discharged in July 1863. After his discharge, George Nash moved to Mount Sterling, married Louise Walden on December 30, 1863, had two children, Carrie (born November 15, 1864) and Henry, and resumed his pre-war occupation as a school teacher.George W.

Nash, and was under the jurisdiction of Yavapai County school superintendent Buckey O'Neill.Strawberry Schoolhouse Historic Site Harry Nash would become friends with O'Neill, who served as Sheriff and then Mayor of Prescott, Arizona in the 1890s.

In 1896, the National Direct Legislation League (\\"N.D.L.L.\\") was founded, and both Nash and O'Neill became active in local efforts to reduce public corruption by establishing an initiative and referendum system that allowed direct legislation by the territory's citizens. In 1897, Nash was appointed the N.D.L.L. Vice-President and Organizer for the Arizona Territory, and wrote a weekly column in the Prescott Pick and Drill promoting the cause.Holy Joe: Joseph W. Folk and the Missouri Idea, p. 142. With the aid of O'Neill, Nash secured the passage of several minor direct legislation laws in the territorial legislature.Direct Legislation Record, Volumes 1–10 The Rough Riders In 1898, war broke out between the United States and Spain. On May 2, Nash enlisted as a Corporal to serve in Troop A of the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry. His enlistment papers noted that he had a fair complexion, dark brown eyes, dark brown hair, and was 5' 6 ¾\\" tall. Nash gave his occupation as \\"Cow Boy\\".Compiled military service record of Henry W. Nash, documenting service in the 1st U. S. Volunteer Cavalry (Rough Riders) during the Spanish–American War., 05/01/1898 - 09/30/1898 The 1st Volunteer Cavalry would soon be widely known as the \\"Rough Riders\\" under the command of Colonel Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt had previously pushed for American support of Cuban independence in his role as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Roosevelt's Rough Riders included many college athletes, cowboys, and ranchers. In April, Buckey O'Neill had also joined the Regiment as Captain of Troop A, and thus was Nash's Troop commander. O'Neill tried to establish an entire Cavalry Regiment made up of Arizona cowboys, but only Troop A and Troop B, with 107 men each, eventually fought in Cuba.Arizona in the Spanish–American War Nash and the other men mustered in at Fort Whipple Barracks near Prescott, Arizona. On May 4, Arizona's Troops marched down to the Prescott town plaza for a grand send-off before they boarded a train headed to San Antonio for difficult and intensive training with \\"half broken range horses\\". Nash apparently did well, as he was promoted to Sergeant on May 14.Compiled military service record of Henry W. Nash, documenting service in the 1st U. S.

On June 13, eight Troops, including A and B, boarded the transport Yucatan No. 8 for Cuba. Four Troops from the Regiment and almost all the men's horses were left behind.Arizona in the Spanish–American War The Rough Riders landed at Daiquirí, Cuba, on June 22, 1898. Nash, by then, had been made Troop A's Second Duty Sergeant, the third highest ranking non-commissioned officer in the Troop after the First Sergeant and the First Duty Sergeant. The next afternoon, the Regiment hiked twelve miles through a jungle to Siboney. On June 24, Nash and the Rough Riders saw their first action at the Battle of Las Guasimas, as 940 Americans advanced steadily against 4000 Spaniards. Nash also participated in the decisive Battle of San Juan Hill on July 1, 1898, where the Rough Riders, led by Colonel Roosevelt, charged and took Kettle Hill, driving the Spanish forces from their trenches. But the victory was not without cost as Captain Buckey O'Neill was killed in action while fighting that day. The Regiment kept the pressure on through the Siege of Santiago that ultimately ended the war in Cuba within a few more weeks.Arizona in the Spanish–American War The camps of the Rough Riders were infested with malaria, and the men were more affected by the mosquito-borne disease than they had been by Spanish bullets. On August 8, the weary Regiment shipped out of Santiago, headed for Camp Wikoff at Montauk Point, New York on Long Island. Upon reaching Camp Wikoff on August 25, Nash was hospitalized with \\"malarial fever\\" contracted while in Cuba.Compiled military service record of Henry W. Nash, documenting service in the 1st U.

Nash is portrayed as a poorly educated stagecoach robber who enlists in the unit when he encounters a recruiting train while outrunning a posse. A clash of personalities immediately develops between Buckey O'Neill and Nash, as Nash considers deserting while being alternately recalcitrant and lazy. O'Neill has a \\"sixth sense\\" that Nash is a criminal, and hounds him to become a real soldier. Later in Cuba, Nash panics at his first experience in battle and is wounded by Spanish soldiers. He then redeems himself by leaving the hospital in spite of his injuries to rejoin the fighting. By doing so, Nash finally gains O'Neill's respect shortly before O'Neill is killed. The film ends with Nash, now a millionaire with a son at Harvard, paying his respects at the grave of Buckey O'Neill around 1920.Rough Riders TV movie at IMDB The \\"Henry Nash\\" character was based largely on William Sterin, who, in fact, did encounter O'Neill in 1889 when Sterin and a gang of three other masked cowboys committed the \\"Canyon Diablo train robbery\\", stealing $1,500 from a Santa Fe Railway train. O'Neill led a posse in pursuit of the gang for weeks, finally capturing them just over the Utah border. The story of the robbery and capture was picked up by newspapers across the country, and O'Neill became famous nationwide as a result. Sterin was sent to Yuma Territorial Prison and supposedly pardoned in 1897.\\"Canyon Diablo Train Robbery\\" Various articles have made unfounded assertions that Sterin joined the Rough Riders posing as \\"Henry Nash\\" and that his former nemesis O'Neill did not recognize him,\\"Canyon Diablo Train Robbery\\"Rough Riders stamp completely ignoring or discounting the fact that Nash and O'Neill knew each other very well.

The word, Daridra (Sanskrit: दरिद्र) means poor, needy or deprived, and the word, Nirdhanta (Sanskrit: निर्धनता) means poverty, poorness or indigence. Overview Ava-yogas indicating poverty basically involve an affliction to the 2nd house or bhava and/or its lord, and to Jupiter and the lord of the 11th. Kemadruma yoga is also caused when the Moon is in the 2nd or in the 12th house and no planet occupies the bhavas either side the Moon; the Shakat yoga is caused when Jupiter occupies the 6th or the 8th house from the Moon, in which both events there will be lack of wealth and much difficulty in making a living or gaining in prosperity. The good bad effects of Daridra yogas are felt during the adverse dashas or planetary periods of the afflicted lords of wealth and gains, and certain Daridra yogas operate from birth till death. There is an ancient dictum that reads – If the Moon occupies either the 6th or the 8th from the lagna and Saturn occupies the 7th house then all that one possesses will soon be lost. Rationale The association of the bhava- lord and the bhava-karaka is essential in any yoga-formation for the sake of bringing out the best results signified by that bhava, both should be vested with requisite strength and be unafflicted. The 2nd house counted from the lagna is the Dhanabhava, the house of wealth and Jupiter is the Dhanakaraka. Affliction caused by cruel planets, by the designated or functional malefics and the Marakas (death inflicting planets) to the 2nd house and its lord and to Jupiter results in poverty of varying degree. Jatakalankara states that if the lord of the Dhanabhava is combined with Jupiter in the 2nd house or in a kendrasthana there will be acquisition of much wealth but if they conjoin in a trikathana then acute poverty and misfortune will result. The location of cruel planets in the kendras from the Moon portends bad results if not evil results. If Saturn is in a kendra from the lagna occupied by the Moon and Jupiter is in the 12th house a person begs for alms and in frustration abandons his or her place or country of birth. Ava-yogas involving inauspicious bhavas and their lords affect the outcome of efforts and undertakings. The Sun owns the 12th house for Virgo lagna, it should not join Venus in the 2nd house or the Moon in the 12th in which case there may not be easy earnings, inflow and retention of wealth, and the person becomes bereft of wealth and suffers from loss of wealth; the Sun, the Moon and Venus conjoining make one clever in grabbing others’ wealth. Natural malefic tenanting evil bhavas do tend to cause worry, pain and suffering more so when they are the lords of auspicious bhavas; for Taurus lagna Saturn, the functional benefic, the yoga-karaka and friend of the lagna-lord, situated in the 8th or the 12th house from the lagna does not promote domestic peace and causes loss of wealth. The respective lords of the 2nd and the 11th house both associating with Jupiter make one very wealthy; they should also preferably be influenced by the lord of a trikonabhava which bhavas are the significators of good fortune, prosperity and great wealth. Any association of the lords of the 2nd, the 11th, the 5th and the 9th bhavas, strong and mutually inclined, indicates gain of wealth. According to Jataka Parijata any exalted planet or a planet occupying its exaltation navamsa if aspecting the Moon makes a person neither covet nor possess wealth even though Saravali states that the Moon aspected by the exalted lord of the lagna gives rise to Raja yoga. The lord of the 8th occupying the 2nd house from the lagna will make a person witness his or her wealth decline or get squandered. Parasara tells Maitreya that a person blessed with benefic yogas remains unfortunate if the birth is on an Amavasya, Krishnapaksha Chaturthi, Surya-sankranti, Mahapata, Solar or Lunar eclipse, Vyatipata, Ashubha yoga, Gandanta, Yamaghanta, Dagdha yoga, Tithikshaya, the Sun is debilitated or with same Janam nakshatra of father or mother or as the 4th issue after the birth of three sisters or three brothers. Persons thus born lead a poor life and also make their parents poor. Constitution When the lords of the lagna, the 2nd and the 11th house are combined with or aspected by malefic planets or have connection with the trikabhavas or their lords then one invariably experiences acute shortage of funds, loss of wealth and incurrence of debts. If the 2nd house from the lagna is occupied by a malefic and the lord of the 2nd house is combined with or aspected by malefic one speaks rudely and earns livelihood with much difficulty. If the 2nd house is occupied by malefic, the lord of the 2nd house is devoid of strength and the lord of the lagna is in a trikabhava conjoined with malefic one knows no comforts in life. The lord of the 11th house relegated to the 3rd, the 6th, the 8th or the 12th indicates loss of wealth and poverty. The lord of the 11th or the 12th occupying the 8th house uninfluenced by benefics indicates poverty. If the lord of the 4th or the 9th house or both combine with the lord of the 8th in any bhava and the lord of the 2nd house is debilitated, if the lord of the lagna is debilitated and the lagna and the 2nd house are occupied by malefic, if the lord of the lagna is in the 6th house and the lords of the 2nd, the 6th or the 8th are natural malefics, if the 2nd house is heavily afflicted and is not aspected by any benefic or if the lords of the 9th and the 10th occupy the 8th house either conjoined with or aspected by the lord of the 8th in all such cases one is bound to suffer the pangs of poverty. If the lords of the lagna and the 12th or the lords of the lagna and the 6th are in mutual exchange of signs and aspected by either the 2nd or the 7th house lord, if Ketu is in the lagna or with the Moon and the lord of the lagna is in the 8th house aspected by a maraka, if the lord of the lagna owns a trikabhava and is aspected by malefic or conjoined with Saturn and is devoid of benefic associations, if the lagna is occupied by a malefic aspected by a maraka or a maraka combined with a malefic occupies the lagna, if the lords of the trikabhavas occupy their own bhavas afflicted by a cruel planet, if the planet associating with a trika-lord is not aspected by the lord of the lagna, the 5th or the 9th, or if the Atmakaraka or the lord of the lagna aspect the Atmakaraka then one certainly remains or becomes poor. If the 2nd house is occupied by a malefic and malefics also tenant the kendrasthanas or if Mars is in the 8th house and the Sun is in Libra sign in a trikonabhava then one ekes out a living as a beggar. Phaladeepika states that if the lagna and its karaka is afflicted by malefics and its lord occupies a trikasthana the person leads an ordinary life, is very poor and insulted by others, if the 2nd house and its karaka is afflicted by malefics and its lord occupies a trikasthana one does not possess anything and remains poor, and his wealth if any is taken away by his enemies, if the 4th house and its karaka is afflicted by malefics and its lord occupies a trikasthana one leads a life devoid of happiness and old age is troublesome, and if the 9th house and its karaka is afflicted by malefics and its lord occupies a trikasthana the one is sloven and sad and the property that is inherited is destroyed. Role of Marakas Planets associated with the lord of the 6th, the 8th the 12th or a marakasthana causes suffering, misery and financial strain. Planets associated with the lord of a trikabhava and simultaneously with marakas bereft of influence of the lords of the 5th and 9th bhavas or the lagna-lord occupying the 12th house and the lord of the 12th situated in the lagna influenced by marakas or the lord of the lagna in the 6th house and the lord of the 6th in the lagna influenced by marakas or the lagna or the Moon afflicted by maracas or the lagna occupied by Ketu and the lord of the lagna situated in the 8th or the lord of the 5th in the 6th and the lord of the 9th situated in the 12th house influenced by marakas or malefics other than the lords of the 9th and the 10th house situated in the lagna influenced by marakas or the lord of the navamsa occupied by Moon or the lagna-lord located in a trikabhava associated with a maraka produce poverty and intense misery, and indicate loss or destruction of wealth, and troublesome period during the course of their antra-dasa or dasa. Cancellation The general perception is that the bhava occupied by a malefic becomes defective, and thus, a malefic situated in the 11th, the house of gains, causes Daridra yoga. But, Saravali states that all planets whether benefic or malefic endow one with wealth and fortunes. Therefore, a planet situated in the 11th house cancels the adversities indicated by Daridra yogas. The same result also applies to aspect on the 11th house but only a strong Moon, Mars or Saturn aspecting the 11th house gives wealth, if they are weak their aspect will result in poverty.

The event was characterized by the company as a strike and by the union as a lockout. It surpassed the steel strike of 1959 as the longest steel industry work stoppage in US history. The stoppage resulted in most USX facilities becoming idle until February 1, 1987, seriously degrading the steel division's market share. A compromise was brokered and accepted by the union membership on January 31, 1987. Background The United States steel industry had been in decline since the late 1970s. Unions blamed management for underinvestment in capital improvements, and management blamed unions for demanding exorbitant pay, benefits, and strict limits on non-union subcontracting. A previous collective bargaining agreement expired at the end of July 1986. The union and management were unable to agree on terms, and over 99% of the USWA membership voted to go on strike when the current contract expired. Work stoppage The USW delivered a letter to USX on July 31, one day before the contract expired, offering to continue work under the terms of the previous contract until a deal could be reached if the union maintained the right to go on strike at any time with 48 hours' notice. USX rejected the offer, as it had already begun lengthy and expensive plant shutdown procedures in anticipation of a strike; furthermore, the ability to stop work on two days' notice would have given the union the ability to cost USX even more money, by disrupting deliveries and requiring another expensive and unplanned plant-idling operation. USX maintained that the offer was never meant to be taken seriously and was a \\"legal fiction,\\" designed to permit striking workers to collect unemployment benefits, as most US states allowed payment of unemployment during a management lockout but not a worker-initiated strike. Negotiations were at an impasse, and most USX facilities remained idle for months. Management-level employees began loading trucks and trains with previously-produced steel kept in inventory themselves and shipping it to customers, which led to violent clashes with striking workers. Corporate raider Carl Icahn announced his intention to take over USX on October 6, 1986 by friendly means if possible or by hostile means if necessary. He began separate negotiations with both the union and management, increasing the pressure on both sides to come to an agreement. Ichan discussed various potential concessions that he might agree to with union leadership. Management feared that an Ichan deal with the union would leads losing control of the company. The union remained publicly neutral but internally came to believe that Ichan merely wanted to extract short-term cash from USX and was not really interested in the long-term health of the steel industry. Management and the union resumed direct negotiations on October 21, 1986, but talks had broken down by November 21. Return to work By January 1987, USX was about to miss major orders for car manufacturers, and union members had reached the end of their unemployment benefits. The sides agreed to a compromise in which unions received their desired restrictions on subcontracting and expanded early retirement benefits, and management received wage concessions and the elimination of about 1,300 union jobs. The union members voted to accept the proposed agreement on January 31, 1987. Both sides claimed victory. On February 4, 1987, three days after the agreement had been reached to end the work stoppage, USX announced that four USX plants would remain closed permanently, eliminating about 3,500 union jobs. At a press conference, USX declared that the plants had been closed since December 31 and were not included in the agreement. However, union members were unaware of that fact when they had voted to accept the deal and would surely have voted otherwise if they had known.

It opened on 4 May 2013 and replaced the previous Eureka Stockade Centre. MADE's launch in 2013 was hampered by budget overruns and long delays. The Museum focused on the Eureka Stockade as the place of origin of Australia's democracy. The Museum housed the original Eureka Flag, upon which the rebels swore an oath to the flag as a symbol of defiance against the ruling colonial government. The flag was on loan from the Art Gallery of Ballarat.  Governance  The Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka was established as an independent not-for-profit organisation with a board of directors and with tax deductible charity status. Its sole member was the City of Ballarat. During its five-year existence, the Museum had two Chairs of the board: Professor David Battersby AM and Kaaren Koomen AM. MADE's was supported by three notable patrons: Lucy Turnbull AO, Rob Knowles AO and former Victorian Premier Steve Bracks AC. Peter FitzSimons AM was an Ambassador for the Museum. The Museum received an annual grant from the City of Ballarat of approximately $1 million. The Museum also received triennial funding from Creative Victoria's OIP grant program and the Department of Education and Training, as well as other donors. The Museum's annual turnover was approximately $2 million and in each year of operation it posted a financial a surplus. The displays at MADE used digital technology to tell stories and discuss democracy.  Closure  At its February 2018 Ordinary Council Meeting, the City of Ballarat Council made the decision to take over management responsibility of the centre. The decision came after lengthy consideration of a feasibility study prepared for Council on the future of the museum. The Museum of Australian Democracy ceased trading on 31 March 2018, only two months before its fifth anniversary. The Council took over the centre, continuing to exhibit the flag, and engaged the Ballarat community to determine the next steps for a community centre based on the site. The Museum of Australian Democracy voluntarily deregistered with ASIC in May 2018, after transferring its assets to the City of Ballarat and de-accessioning its collection, returning borrowed and donated objects to donors.  History of the Eureka site  In 1854 a period of civil disobedience by gold miners over the actions of the government culminated in a rebellion at Eureka, Victoria, during which at least 27 people, mostly rebels, died. It was the most prominent rebellion in Australia's history. It is held to be the birthplace of Australian democracy. The Eureka Flag Various memorials have been erected at the site since the rebellion, with the former Eureka Centre being refurbished to become the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka between 2011 and 2013. This development was funded by $5 million from both the Australian and Victorian governments and $1.1 million from the City of Ballarat. The Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka redevelopment project was managed by Katherine Armstrong from Lateral Projects. The building was designed by architects Beveridge Williams and included a 114-seat theatre, and a cafe. The original business case for the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka anticipated that annual visitation would reach 125,000. In 2017, the Museum reached a record 68,000 visitors. Following MADE's closure, a public lobby group called for the return of the flag to the Art Gallery of Ballarat. The public debate over the MADE site and the Eureka story also continued. The displays at MADE used digital technology to tell stories and discuss democracy.  Exhibitions and awards  MADE explored the powerful story of the Eureka Stockade and life on the Gold Fields in the 1850s as a significant part of the struggle for peoples’ rights in Australia and around the world. MADE commemorated the pivotal role of the Stockade in shaping Australia’s democracy. This is where a group of largely young people fought injustice, and won some of the first democratic rights in the world. The key feature of the exhibition was the original Eureka Flag that was first flown at the site of the Centre during the Eureka Rebellion in 1854.Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka  M.A.D.E MADE’s permanent exhibition used innovative digital immersion to engage visitors with the questions: What is democracy and why do we care? Why has it been fought for, yesterday and today? What does it feel like to be without power? Combining contemporary technology with historic objects, the role of the people as the centre of democracy was explored. How are decisions made? Who are they made for? What influence do you have in our contemporary democracy today? The Museum used digital technology and touch screens to tell the stories of the Eureka Stockade. Through a series of public programs and temporary exhibitions, visitors were inspired to explore diversity, creativity and the hidden stories of the past and present. As a centre of discussion on contemporary democracy, MADE hosted some of Australia’s most creative thinkers through partnerships with The Wheeler Centre and Melbourne Writers Festival. In its time, the Museum welcomed Anne Summers, Yassmin Abdel-Magied, Clare Wright, Deng Adut, Gail Kelly and many more. Students learn about the Eureka flag and the Eureka Stockade. The Museum also housed the Quilt of Hope, a community art project created by the Moving Towards Justice group which commemorated the lives of victims of institutional sexual abuse in Ballarat. After the Museum was closed, the Quilt of Hope was donated to the Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House in Canberra. Quilt made to commemorate the victims of institutional sexual abuse in Ballarat. The Museum's regular exhibitions brought wide praise, including * The Campaign for Disability Rights: Grassroots Democracy * Bling which brought together Gold Fields jewellery for the first time in 2016 * Chinese Fortunes which examined the migration experience from China. Chinese Fortunes travelled to The Immigration Museum in Melbourne and the Kyenton Museum, in regional Victoria. * Our Wonderful World * Roses from the Heart * Historyonics: the Monster Petition * Eureka Day anniversary celebrations, particularly the 160th anniversary and the recreation of the Eureka Flag by descendants. Anniversary of the Eureka Stockade at MADE Brooch from the MADE exhibition Bling, examining jewellery from the Gold Fields. Between its opening in 2013 and closure in 2018, the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka had more than 262,000 visitors, with almost 40,000 visits from students attending the highly regarded primary and secondary schools program. During its five years of operation, MADE won a number of awards: * 2017 Commerce Ballarat's Visit Ballarat Business Excellence Awards for Special Events and Attractions * 2015 Winner for Innovation in the MAGNA Awards run by Museum and Galleries National for the Eureka Day 160th Anniversary Program * 2013 Achievement Award for Excellence in category of Partner, VCAL promotion from the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority * 2013 Eureka Democracy Award from Eureka's Children.  Controversies  The Museum was subject to a number of controversies in its short life. Many people in Ballarat remember fondly the Eureka Centre, a tourism and visitor centre which at its peak attracted 25,000 people each year. The Eureka Centre was home to a diorama which explained the Eureka Stockade. The diorama disappeared in the development of the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka and has become a local Ballarat mystery. The Museum's initial development ran over budget and caused ongoing political ramifications in the media and in public discourse. In November 2017, cafe owner Saltbush Kitchen decided to discontinue its presence at MADE after months of uncertainty over the Museum's future. In early 2018, Federal MP, Catherine King (politician) gave a speech in federal parliament accusing the City of Ballarat of changing its priorities in relation to MADE's funding arrangement. Three weeks prior to the City of Ballarat's vote on the future of the Museum, Deputy Mayor Daniel Moloney resigned from the board of MADE, citing conflicts of interest.

Crohmălniceanu (c.1957) Ovid S. Crohmălniceanu (born Moise Cahn or Cohn; 16 August 1921, in Galați, Romania - 27 April or 28 April 2000, in Berlin, Germany) was a Romanian literary critic and science fiction writer. Biography After graduating from high school in his home town, he began to study, in 1939, at the Politehnica University of Bucharest, but had to interrupt his studies in 1940. In 1944, he resumed his studies, and got a diploma in construction engineering in 1947. After World War II, he had a series of jobs in the magazines (Contemporanul, Viața Românească, Gazeta literară) and in a publishing house (Editura Didactică și Pedagogică) before beginning to work as an academic, eventually becoming a professor at the Department of Romanian Language and Literature of the University of Bucharest. During the first two decades after World War II, at least, Crohmălniceanu was known as a promoter of socialist realism, branding any kind of freedom writers dared take as being \\"reminiscences of bourgeois thinking\\" and \\"influenced by reactionary circles in the West.\\" But, at the same time, he is one of those who played a major role in bringing Tudor Arghezi and Lucian Blaga back into the limelight, after they had been marginalized. In his last decade in Romania, before emigrating to Germany in 1992, he supported many young writers, encouraging them to follow another path than that of communist nationalism. He died during the night of 27 to 28 April 2000.

Rates are a tax on property. Domestic rates consist of two components, a regional rate set by the Northern Ireland Assembly and a district rate set by local councils. Rate levels are set annually. Valuation and rating of property is handled by Land and Property Services. Domestic rates are unique to Northern Ireland, in the rest of the United Kingdom the local taxation is Council Tax. Valuation Land and Property Services is the authority responsible for registering and valuing property. The domestic rates are based on the capital value of the residential property on 1 January 2005. This is in contrast to non-domestic rates on businesses which are based on rental value. District rate The district rate is set by local authorities, the eleven district councils. It is for services such as refuse collections and disposal, leisure, parks and street cleaning. District rates in 2015/2016 range from 0.006764 set by Lisburn and Castlereagh District Council to 0.008374 set by Derry and Strabane District Council. Regional rate The regional rate is set by the Northern Ireland Assembly. It is used for services such as education, health and roads. Rate Rebate Working age customers living in Northern Ireland and claiming Universal Credit can now claim Rate Rebate for help with domestic rates. Housing benefit Another rebate existed for domestic rates. Confusingly, this was named Housing Benefit & Rate Relief, despite another Housing Benefit also existing to assist with rent payments. This benefit is now restricted to pensioners, and benefit claimants receiving a Severe Disability Premium. Administration of Housing Benefit was split between two organisations depending on whether the claimant was renting or was an owner- occupier; tenants could claim both kinds of Housing Benefit, while owner- occupiers could only get Housing Benefit for rates. * Tenants had to apply to the Northern Ireland Housing Executive regardless of whether they rented from a private landlord, from the NIHE itself, or from a housing association. * Owner-occupiers had to apply to the Land and Property Services agency.

One of many private medical schools of the period, it had popular lecturers on its staff, and proved a serious rival to St. Bartholomew's Hospital as a teaching institution. Foundation The Aldersgate School was set up in 1825 by Frederick Tyrrell; the founding group included William Lawrence, William Coulson and others. At that point the shared medical school of Guy's Hospital and St. Thomas's Hospital was divided. Tyrrell lectured at the Aldersgate School, but later took a position at St. Thomas's, and was no longer involved with the Aldersgate school. Lawrence was also an early supporter of the school, lecturing on surgery in 1826–7; but he withdrew after taking a position at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Lawrence was a reformer, and the background was his opposition to an 1824 regulation of the Royal College of Surgeons aiming to limit the number of medical schools that a surgical student could attend. He saw this measure as intended to force students into the hospital medical schools. Jones Quain taught anatomy alongside Lawrence; but he had to drop out following a dissection wound. Henry Clutterbuck of the nearby Aldersgate Dispensary moved his lectures to the school in 1826. In the same year Peter Roget was brought in to lecture on physiology. Staff James Wardrop, one of the founders, lectured on surgery alongside Lawrence, and provided some continuity. The school retained a reputation for radicalism, and sympathy with French theories. In the 1830s prominent replacement lecturers were found for the initial ones. Frederic Carpenter Skey was in dispute with Lawrence at St. Bartholomew's, and taught surgery for a decade. The physician James Hope from the mid-1830s combined lecturing at the Aldersgate School with other positions. The pharmacologist Jonathan Pereira came in to lecture on materia medica. Robert Edmond Grant lectured on anatomy, and Thomas Hodgkin on pathology. With the eventual decline of the school in the 1840s, some of its staff moved to St. Bartholomew's medical school. They included James Paget.

In games journalism, he is known for his association with mid-2000s New Games Journalism, his verbose writing style, and his video game reviews website ActionButton.net. The Guardian cited his 2005 opinion piece \\"Dreaming in an empty room: a defense of Metal Gear Solid 2\\" as a core example of New Games Journalism, a style of video game journalism that emphasizes the author's subjective and personal experiences in relation to the game world. Rogers has also written for Next Generation, GamesTM, Play, Game Developer, and Kotaku. In game development, he is a co-founder of Action Button Entertainment, where he designed games including Ziggurat and Videoball. The four-person studio specializes in simple aesthetics and controls, following from Rogers's own video game aesthetic and minimalist eSports interests. He compared the studio's design philosophy to the spartan menu selections of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares. Rogers translated the 1997 PlayStation game Moon: Remix RPG Adventure into English for its 2020 rerelease on the Nintendo Switch.  Early and personal life  \\"Gentlemen, Start Your Clown Shoes\\" by Rogers's rock band, Large Prime Numbers William Timothy Rogers Jr. was born on June 7, 1979. He graduated from Indiana University Bloomington in 2001 with a degree in East Asian languages and cultures. He is a \\"self-avowed messy guitar player\\" in his rock band, Large Prime Numbers. He has written that Mother 2 made him a vegetarian.  Video games journalism  Rogers is a video games journalist known for his verbosity. Danny Cowan of IndieGames.com described him as \\"infamous\\" in New Games Journalism, a style of subjective video game journalism in which authors emphasize their personal experiences in relation to the game world. The Guardian cited Rogers as one of the \\"unmissable examples of New Games Journalism\\" in 2005 for his Insert Credit piece on Metal Gear Solid 2, \\"Dreaming in an empty room: a defense of Metal Gear Solid 2\\". Gaming journalist Kieron Gillen called the article \\"highly discussed and fairly brilliant\\". In 2006, Simon Carless of GameSetWatch remarked that online communities were fascinated with Rogers as an originator of New Games Journalism, which Carless found at odds with their mistreatment of him, citing a Something Awful mock review of Sonic Riders. The next year, the same author cited Rogers' 80,000-word article, \\"the insertcredit.com fukubukuro 2006: GAME OF THE YEAR EDITION\\", in calling Rogers \\"the Lester Bangs of video games\\" for being the only person \\"disruptive and iconoclastic enough\\" for the title. In 2011, Jim Rossignol of Rock, Paper, Shotgun recommended \\"Who Killed Videogames?\\", a new Rogers essay, as a standout work. Rogers started ActionButton.net, a video games reviews website, in early 2007 as an outgrowth from Insert Credit and its forums, SelectButton. At the time of its launch, Simon Carless of GameSetWatch called the site \\"great writing\\" in a signature \\"self-conscious metacommentary\\" style. GamesRadar called Tim Rogers \\"loquacious\\" and \\"a character\\" as profiled in Cara Ellison's \\"Embed With...\\" profile series, where they discussed \\"sticktion\\" as the role of \\"sticky friction\\" in Super Mario Bros. 3 and how it was used in Rogers' own Ziggurat and Videoball. Edge described Rogers as a \\"polarising author of so much 'publish-now-edit-never' brain spew\\". In 2013, Rogers was selected to publish in the first round of digital books on games criticism published by Press Select. Rogers has also written for Insert Credit, Next Generation, GamesTM, Play, N-Revolution, Kotaku, Atomix, and Game Developer magazine. As of June 2016, Rock, Paper, Shotgun reported ActionButton.net to be \\"dormant\\".  Action Button Entertainment  Rogers is a co-founder of Action Button Entertainment, a four-person studio that consists of Rogers, Brent Porter, Michael Kerwin, and Nicholas Wasilewski, who together have built all of the studio's four games from Ziggurat through Videoball. Their games are consistently simple in their aesthetics and controls, following from Rogers's own video game aesthetic interests. His interest in minimalist eSports and simple games parlays into his design philosophy, which he compared to Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, a show in which Ramsay advises failing restaurants to improve by trimming their menus to a spartan few great dishes. Rogers also felt simple games were \\"less work\\". Rogers has said that he aspires for Action Button Entertainment to make games that share his preferred gaming styles and his hobbies. In finding that the common link between his top 25 video games (including Panzer Dragoon, Cave Story, Canabalt, and his favorite, Out of This World) was minimalist aesthetics with no overt story to tell other than through game mechanics, Rogers wanted Ziggurat and future games to live up to those expectations and used his gut to fine-tune design decisions. The games also reflect aspects of Rogers's personality, such as in the \\"scream sound effect\\" on Ziggurat made and distorted from his guitar and based on sounds made by eccentric Japanese musicians whose records he owned. He also called Ziggurat a descendant of his hobbies: the video game Ibara: Black Label and the Rubik's Cube. Rogers also became known for producing promotional \\"infomercial-style trailers\\". = Ziggurat = Ziggurat is a retro-style arcade shooter video game where the player fights off incoming aliens as the world's last human from atop a ziggurat. The player uses simple touch controls to charge and shoot the enemies away, and dies if hit by an enemy. The game has 16-bit graphics style and an 8-bit chiptune soundtrack. Rogers co-founded Action Button Entertainment while working on Ziggurat, which began with an idea Rogers had while playing Angry Birds about pushing back a swarm of bats by shooting projectiles at them. He decided that he could not make the game alone. Rogers put out a call for artists on Twitter with a submissions request of \\"fan art of the Japanese box art of Phantasy Star II\\", and Action Button artist Brent Porter replied in under an hour with an entry Rogers called \\"incredible\\". In mid 2011, Rogers decided to work on an iPhone game for a few weeks as a break from a larger project. Rogers said the team was convinced by his design documentthis game would become Ziggurat. Rogers contacted an Internet acquaintance who had previously mocked up a design idea from Rogers's Kotaku column, programmer Michael Kerwin, who came through with a rough draft within a week. Andrew Toups converted a soundtrack created by Rogers's rock band into an 8-bit soundtrack. After six months of hiatus and working at a social games company, Rogers rekindled development and the team finished the Ziggurat, which was released in February 2012 for iOS platforms. Edge related the \\"unexpectedly poignant\\" red screen and sound effect that flashes upon the player's death to Rogers's personal interest in noise rock. They called it a \\"beguiling personal signature\\". = TNNS = TNNS, pronounced \\"tennis\\", is a brick-breaking action game where players use a paddle along the screen's left side to bounce a ball towards breakable objects on the right side of the screen, and to avoid getting the ball in their goal. It was released with little advanced notice in November 2012 for iOS as a universal app playable on iPhones, iPads, and iPods. Danny Cowan of IndieGames.com compared it with Sidhe Interactive's Shatter and VG247 called it a rendition of Breakout. Pocket Gamer likened it to both and further compared it with Alleyway, Arkanoid, and Super Hexagon with a \\"telekinetic power\\" to alter the ball's direction apart from the panel (as in Shatter). = 10×8 = Ten by Eight, stylized as 10×8, is a puzzle video game where players match tiles. Players align similarly colored blocks and trace the path they create when aligned. Star blocks act as power-ups that extend combos. Rogers produced an \\"infomercial-style trailer\\" for the game, which VG247 called one of his signature moves and that IndieGames.com called \\"glorious\\". It was released on July 31, 2013 in North America for PlayStation Mobilethe PlayStation Vita and compatible devices. Around the same time, Rogers presented at the GDC 2013 Indie Soapbox, where he told the story of how he \\"went indie\\". = Videoball = In Videoball, players use solely one analog stick and one button to control triangles that shoot projectiles to knock a circular ball into the opposing team's endzone. The triangle shoots a projectile, which charges the longer the button is held, such that a charged \\"slam\\" shot can sail across the full screen. Rogers, the game's designer, describes the game as \\"an abstract minimalist electronic sport\\". Its development began as a dare from QWOP developer Bennett Foddy, Rogers's friend, to make a \\"one-button StarCraft\\". Rogers compared the game's design process to Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, where Ramsay convinces failing restaurants to provide fewer menu options and to make those dishes well. Rogers noted the role of noted basketball-like strategy in its playtests, and the difficulty in crafting a minimalist game with a high importance on nuanced detail. He livestreams prerelease sessions of Videoball via Twitch and broadcast gameplay from Twitch's booth at PAX East 2014 with indie publisher Midnight City. The game was released in 2016.

Entitlement It replaced Widowed Mother's Allowance in 2001 as part of the process of removing sex discrimination from the Social Security system. It is available to anyone with a child whose husband, wife or civil partner has died. The claimant must get Child Benefit for at least one child and the late husband, wife or civil partner was their parent. It is not available if the partners were divorced at the time of death, if the claimant is in prison, if they remarry or are cohabitating with another person by means of living together as a married couple. Amount of benefit In 2013 the maximum payment is £108.30 a week. It is taxable, but it is not affected by the receipt of other income. It is counted in full for all means-tested benefits. The amount payable is dependent on the National Insurance contributions paid by the deceased. It could be affected by the benefit cap. It continues while Child Benefit continues. Proposed changes In July 2013 it was reported that the government was planning changes in the Pensions Bill 2012 going through parliament, which would limit this benefit to a maximum of £400 a month paid out for just 12 months, with a lump sum of £5,000 following bereavement. The 43,500 families already in receipt of the allowance would be unaffected by the reforms. The Department of Work and Pensions estimated that in 2016 the government expects to pay £590m a year to bereaved couples and families. With the changes, payments would drop to £530m by 2020.

The character shares a similarity with Sara Crewe from Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel A Little Princess as her fondness, friendliness and love for storytelling makes her popular with her fellow chiquititas. Mili is also decided to uncover the truth about her family and her unknown past. Her only clue, and closest memory of them is a small, golden brooch supposed left by her parents, with the word \\"Volveré\\" (\\"I will be back\\") inscribed, a promise in which Mili faithfully believes. Storyline=Years at the manor= Mili was the first orphan to join the Rincón de Luz institution, which received nine other girls over the course of the years. Every night before sleeping, she entertains them with stories and tales she creates. The girls are supervised by the rigorous janitor of the manor, Ernestina, and the adorable chef of the house, Saverio. The nine chiquititas are also frequently visited by Belén, Saverio's sweet-hearted and dedicated goddaughter. Emilia administrates the manor, which was founded by Ramiro Morán, an important entrepreneur. After things go wrong at the orphanages anniversary party, and Carmen Morán (Ramiro's authoritarian sister) has decided to fire Saverio, Mili is the one who convinces Ramiro to let Saverio stay. While visiting the Moráns' mansion, she meets Ramiro's younger son Martín, and his sister Gabriela. Gabriela supposedly lost her son and became mentally ill, which embittered Martín. Mili eases their situation by becoming Martín and Gabriela's young friend. Martín reciprocates by helping Mili in her search for her family, and Belén joins them. The orphans later receive a new intern, a tiny but aggressive girl named Jime. Jime had a difficult background and had lost her trust on people. She initially does not get along with her new family, and Mili later softens her conduct, becoming her newest, greatest best friend. Mili and Jime's friendship, as well as Jime's apparent change, comes into question after Cinthia, one of the girls, makes everyone suspect that Jime stole Mili's brooch. Carmen's unscrupulous acts lead to Emilia's removal from the position as the house's admin. Mili insists to Martín to have the woman back, but she travels before things can be made clear. However, she's not replaced by Carmen, as Ramiro nominates his girlfriend Ginette on Emilia's place. =Adulthood= Mili returns to the manor as a young adult after her mother dies. She is shocked for discovering that the current orphans are deprived from their dreams and happiness, after an ambitious woman named Lidia takes over the house. She starts working on a nearby bar, where she falls in love for a handsome young man named Ramiro. Mili is decided to change the orphans' situation starting from the inside, following Belén's lessons. She joins the house as Greta, a supposedly rigorous janitor newly hired by Lidia. Mili then discovers Lidia's true plans for the children, as the woman intends to send the group back to the horrible child prison they had to escape years before, the Hogar de las Sombras. Mili reveals her true identity for them, but the orphans do not believe her. The only exception is Maria, who recognizes Mili from the Book of Life, which was written by Belén in the past. Lidia ties Mili and Ramiro in the Attic after discovering the truth and lies to the orphans about a tour promoted by her. The group then find out that the van actually belongs to the Hogar, and manage to escape. Mili and Ramiro also gets rid from the strings and Lidia is caught by the police. Lidia, however, reveals she had installed a time bomb inside the manor, since the house won't belong to her. The group desperately leaves the house and, after Agustín is left behind, Mili gets back to save him. As Lidia delights with her destruction, Mili states that nothing will destroy their home, as long as the chiquititas stand united. A light gleam appears in the sky and the group witness as Belén makes magically rebuilds the manor. Mili's fellow interns, who lived in the orphanage with her in the past (Such as Sol, Jime, Guille and Corcho) also appear among them. The ending of Chiquititas indicates that Mili, Ramiro and the orphans have started a definitive family altogether. Other versions=Chiquititas Brasil= Mili as portrayed by Fernanda Souza in Chiquititas Brasil. Fernanda Souza portrays Mili in the Brazilian series. Her storyline is similar with the key difference that, in this version, Mili gets to known her father. He is Miguel, who is hidden inside the manor and seeks to know who his lost daughter is. After a disfiguring aerial accident, Miguel was forced to use a mask to hide the scars left on his face. Miguel went to live inside the manor and was unsure of which girl was his lost daughter. After he finds out that she is actually Mili, he kidnaps she and Carol, taking them to his airplane. Mili witness as Miguel falls from the airplane, without revealing the truth to anyone. With the help of Fernando (Carol's boyfriend and Miguel's friend from), Carol manages to land the airplane. While attempting to hide the truth from everyone, Carmem \\"hires\\" Marian, an ambitious and compulsive liar intern of the manor. Marian often targets Mili with her envy and causes her to become temporarily blind, making her life as difficult as possible. In one occasion, Marian makes Mili to be run over by a boy with his bike, Luca. Noticing they are falling for each other, Marian shatters their relationship and manages to take Luca from Mili. She also makes Gabriela do become fond for her, until Matilde, the house's former janitor who discovered the truth, returned and told Carol that Mili was actually Gabriela's daughter. Sometime before Christmas, Carol reunites the orphans and tells them the truth about Mili. Desperate, she remembers Miguel and her grandfather José Ricardo, both of them having tragic deaths. Carmem attempts to kidnap Mili but fails, and the girl is rescued by Luca, Mosca and her fellows, and Marian herself, after she redeems herself. Now aware of everything, Mili forgives Marian, stating that she would not ruin that happy moment of hers. At the Raio de Luz's Christmas party, Mili leaves Carol and her fellow orphans with Gabriela and Luca (Mili's boyfriend). Carol later recalls her by tenderly keeping a photograph of Mili. =2013 version= Giovanna Grigio as Mili at the series' press conference. In this version, she tells a fairy tale to her fellows, unaware the story is her own background. Giovanna Grigio portrays Mili in the Brazilian 2013 telenovela. Mili is considerably older than her fellow chiquititas in this version, and aspires to become a professional writer. Apart from her unknown origin, Mili's aging worries her and brings her adoption into question among herself and the others. Mili tells to the other girls the fairy tale of a princess who is separated from her lover, a commoner man, by her cold-hearted father, the King, who sends his daughter to a faraway land of cold, sadness and darkness. The Princess and the Commoner's love is symbolized by a white rose, which falls and grows nearby the manor of a witch. Later, six other flowers grow around the White Rose, and they become a family. Mili is unaware that she is telling her own story, which was modified and adapted by Sofia, their orphanage's fond admin. The Princess is actually Gabriela, Mili's mother who fell in deep depression and was left traumatized after her father José Ricardo Almeida Campos (the King) lied about the deaths of Miguel (the Commoner) and their newborn child. José Ricardo persuaded Sofia to hide the truth, and Sofia named the baby Milena, gave her a rose-shaped necklace in which is inscribed \\"Voltarei\\" (\\"Volveré\\"), and sent her to the manor which eventually became the Raio de Luz insituition, sheltering other six girls (the flowers). Sofia told Mili the tale and she repassed to the other chiquititas every night. Mili is often targeted by the envy of Bia and befriends and changes the aggressive newcomer Pata, a girl who is taken off the streets and sent to the orphanage through a sweet-hearted young woman, Carol. Aware that Pata had a brother and friends, all of them boys, Mili convinces José Ricardo to allow males in the manor, against the will of José Ricardo's ambitious sister Carmen the witch. Carol advised Mili when the young girl experienced her first period. For the first time in a Chiquititas production, Pata's brother Mosca falls for Mili and gives her an old book of fairy tales. Mili asks Sofia to write the tale's ending in the book, and Sofia only writes that is up to her to discover the end. Sofia asks Carol to take care of the orphans and passes away. Despite attracted to him as well, Mili is insecure about Mosca and becomes fond for Duda, a spoiled boy who gradually changes after meeting her, and later for JP, an aspiring singer, causing jealousy in Mosca and JP's girlfriend Renata. Mili's father Miguel returns from after several years recluse in the Amazon forest, with half of his face covered with scars, hidden under a mask. Searching for his daughter, Miguel is hidden by his mother Valentina (the Almeida Campos family's housekeeper) in the manor's basement, from where he is able to lurk and watch throughout the house and its inhabitants. Miguel briefly reunites with Gabriela (who shortly regains consciousness), but her father's henchmen separate the couple once again. As Gabriela ran from them, she fell on a rock and lost her memory. When José Ricardo succumbs to a heart failure, Mili decides to visit him in the hospital with some other chiquititas (and Carol, who was blackmailed by him in order to break up with his son Júnior). From the bed, José Ricardo asks forgiveness to Mili, leaving her confused, and later passes away as well. Carmen sees in this her chance to become the only heiress of her family's wealth, sending Gabriela to France and lying to her brother Júnior that Gabriela died in a helicopter crash. Valentina, aware that Mili is her lost granddaughter, is run over by a car and falls into a coma, leaving Miguel desperate. Júnior, however, is resolute to uncover the truth. Matilde, who is posing as her twin sister Ernestina (the manor's janitor), discovers the truth about Mili and blackmails Carmen. The two come into agreement and Carmen allows Matilde to have a percent of \\"her\\" inheritance. They confuse Miguel, making him think that Bia is his lost daughter, but the masked man, while lurking them, also discovers that Matilde is not who she claims to be and threatens her. Instructed by Carmen, Matilde lies and tells him his daughter is named Marian. After Carmem's several attempts of placing Marian as Gabriela's daughter, Carol and Júnior eventually discover the truth, and Carol reunites Mili and the chiquititas to tell them Mili's story. The girl is kidnapped by Carmem, and saved by Mosca and her friends. In the end, Gabriela and Miguel are reunited with Mili. The series ends with a celebration of Mili's fifteenth birthday at the Raio de Luz manor, as the fairy tale she told the chiquititas at the beginning also comes to an end. Mexican version Ixchel del Paso portrayed Mili in the Mexican series.

They were a member of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and are a co-founder of the Amy Winehouse Foundation. In recognition of their intersex activism, The Independent on Sunday called them an LGBT \\"national treasure\\" and ranked them second in its 2015 \\"Rainbow List\\" of the most influential LGBT people in the UK. In 2017 they wrote and performed in a solo play called Angels are Intersex, and in 2018 they executive produced the short film Ponyboi.  Life  Graham was born in the United Kingdom in 1969 with the first name Sarah. They have XY chromosomes, but due to having complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), they were identified and raised as a girl. Doctors lied to them and their parents about their diagnosis, subjected them to repeated medical investigations, and removed their internal testes (which the doctors claimed were ovaries) at age seven or eight \\"to protect them from cancer and imminent death\\", resulting in them needing otherwise-unnecessary hormone replacement therapy from age 12. Graham was not given their CAIS diagnosis until they were 25. They were offered no support and, already a regular drug user, the diagnosis led to a period of self-destruction including alcohol and drug addiction. After several months of treatment, Graham recovered. They later became an addiction counsellor, saying \\"I have turned my pain into my work\\".  Career and activism  Graham worked as an addiction counsellor and therapist, running their own drug rehabilitation company which included a weekly LGBTI addiction and recovery therapy group. They have written articles on drug addiction for a variety of newspapers and magazines including The Sun, The Times, and Diva, and appeared on radio and television programmes including The Today Programme, BBC News and This Morning. Graham was on the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs from 2011 to 2017. They were an expert communicator for the government drug education service FRANK, and co-founded the Amy Winehouse Foundation. Because of their activism, The Independent on Sunday listed them as a \\"national treasure\\" in its 2011 \\"Pink List\\", and in the renamed 2015 \\"Rainbow List\\" called them the second most influential LGBT person in the UK. Graham has advocated for intersex human rights, including speaking out against surgery to \\"normalise\\" intersex children's bodies. They have also investigated legal recognition of intersex as a distinct gender, and praised Germany for allowing babies to be registered as neither male nor female. In 2017, Graham wrote and performed a solo play titled Angels are Intersex. After Angels are Intersex they began using the name Seven Graham and they/them pronouns. Graham was an executive producer of the 2018 short film Ponyboi, along with executive producers Stephen Fry, Johan Sorenson, Elizabeth Sorenson, and DJ Rutherford, and co-producers Emma Thompson, Rachel Singer, and Jamison Monroe. It was the first film to feature an intersex actor playing the role of an intersex person.

She was the mother of Citra Award-winning musician Idris Sardi. Biography Hadidjah was born in South Sulawesi, Dutch East Indies, on 13 June 1923. By 1939 she had married Mas Sardi (1910–1953) and had a son, Idris (born 7 June 1938). When The Teng Chun signed Mas Sardi to handle music for his company, Java Industrial Film, Hadidjah joined him. While Mas Sardi was music director, Hadidjah became an actress. Her debut was in Roesia si Pengkor (Secret of the Clubfoot; 1939), in which she portrayed a young woman who was protected against an unwanted suitor by her lover and her father. After Roekiah and Rd Mochtar of Tan's Film became the colony's first on-screen couple, appearing in box-office hits such as Fatima (1938), Java Industrial Film decided to pair Hadidjah with Moh Mochtar, a football player skilled at silat, and cast them in romantic roles. In their first film together, Alang-Alang (Grass; 1939), Hadidjah portrayed a villager named Surati who is kidnapped by a spurned suitor and shipwrecked on a jungle island. This film was a massive commercial hit in the Indies and nearby British Malaya, and the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits it as one of the causes of the revival the domestic film industry underwent in 1940. The success of this film led Hadidjah and Moh Mochtar to be cast in romantic roles together for another five films for Java Industrial Film. In 1940, Hadidjah appeared in Matjan Berbisik (Whispering Tiger) as a young woman whom two brothers fight over, then in Rentjong Atjeh (Rencong of Aceh) as a young woman who survives in the jungle with her brother before falling in love with a soldier. In 1941 the pair appeared in another three films: Srigala Item (Black Wolf), Si Gomar, and Singa Laoet. The Japanese occupied the Indies in March 1942, closing Java Industrial Film. Afterwards Hadidjah rarely acted. She returned to the silver screen for the first time in 1954, taking a small role in Kembali ke Masjarakat. She later took small roles in several further films, as if she was not keen to regain stardom. In 1976 she received an award from Governor of Jakarta Ali Sadikin in recognition of her contributions to the cinema of Indonesia. Hadidjah died in Jakarta on 10 October 2013.

They are offered special food of rice and vegetables. Sacrifice is offered to deity Gaurea(Spirit of cowshed). Sohrai is day to express gratitude and affection for livestocks. The harvest festival is the time of the year when they exhibit their artistic skills and expressions. Every year, after the festival is over, the drawings and patterns created during this time are erased. This festival usually takes place in the month October or November for three days. The festival coincide with Diwali. Sohrai is the chief festival of Santhal tribe held in after the chief rice crop of the year has been got in.  Arts  In Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand, an indigenous art form is practised by the women. Ritualistic art is done on mud walls to welcome the harvest and to celebrate the cattle. The women clean their houses and decorate their walls with murals of Sohrai arts. This art form has continued since 10,000-4,000 BC. It was prevalent mostly in caves, but shifted to houses with mud walls. Bhelwara Sohrai This Sohrai art form can be monochromatic or colorful. The people coat the wall with a layer of white mud, and while the layer is still wet, they draw with their fingertips on it. Their designs range from flowers and fruits to various other nature-inspired designs. The cow dung that was earlier used to cake the walls of the house is used to add colour. The dark outline is visible due to the previously applied contrasting white mud coat. Sohrai artists are spontaneous in their drawing. Little pre-planning is evident. The canvases range up to 12 x 18 feet..The designs are usually drawn from the artist's memory. The personal experience of the artist and their interaction with nature are the biggest influence.

Business rates are collected throughout the United Kingdom. Domestic rates are collected in Northern Ireland and were collected in England and Wales before 1990 and in Scotland before 1989. Domestic rates=England and Wales= Rates had their origin in the Act for the Relief of the Poor 1601, for parishes to levy a poor rate to fund the Poor Law, although parishes often adopted property rates to fund earlier poor law measures. Indeed, the Court of Appeal in 2001 called the rating an \\"ancient system\\", suggesting that it had medieval origins. As local government developed, separate rates were collected by parish authorities, borough corporations and county authorities. The County Rates Act 1739 ended the practice of separate rates being levied for individual purposes, such a highway rate and provided for a unified county rate. Rates on residential property were based on the nominal rental value, reassessed periodically in revaluations. By the Rating and Valuation Act 1925, revaluations were supposed to take place every five years but in practice they were frequently delayed or suspended. Revaluations took place in 1928/1929, 1934, 1956 (but based on 1939 values), 1963, and 1973. A revaluation due in the early 1980s was scrapped by the Secretary of State for the Environment Michael Heseltine in June 1979, with Heseltine urging householders to tear up the forms already sent out by the Valuation Office.Alan Day, \\"Heseltine's hassle over the Rates\\", The Observer, 1 July 1979, p. 10. Rates were abolished in England and Wales in 1990 and replaced with the Community Charge (so called \\"poll tax\\"), a fixed tax per head that was the same for everyone within a council area, a figure that could differ greatly per local authority. This was soon replaced with the Council Tax, a system based on the estimated market value of property assessed in bands of value, with a discount for people living alone. The Crown Estate Paving Commission still levies rates on residential property within its jurisdiction, in the area around Regent's Park, London, under the provisions of the Crown Estate Paving Act 1851. =Northern Ireland= Domestic rates are the current local government taxation in Northern Ireland. Domestic rates consist of two components, the Regional rate set by the Northern Ireland Assembly and the District rate set by 26 district councils. Rate levels are set annually. The domestic rates are based on the capital value of the residential property on 1 January 2005. Valuation and rating of property is handled by Land and Property Services. Domestic rates are now unique to Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. =Scotland= As in England, the individual domestic rates bill was calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation of a property by the domestic poundage rate set by the local Council. Before the 1995 reform of local government, domestic rates were set by Regional Councils, and prior to the 1975 reorganisation, rates were set by County Councils. The rateable value of domestic properties was recorded in valuation rolls, which provide an important historical source, as they record the name of the head of the household for every home in Scotland on set years; usually at five yearly intervals.See National Records of Scotland All transfers of property ownership in Scotland are recorded in the Register of Sasines or the Scottish Land Registry https://scotlandsearch.org.uk/faq/9-what-are-the-land-register-and- the-sasine-register. Domestic rates were a more stable income source for local government as they are based entirely on property values which provide greater financial certainty to councils - reducing their cost of borrowing. Evasion of domestic rates was also more difficult in Scotland than in England as property ownership in Scotland can be more easily proven as Scots' Law has required public registration for a transfer of property to be effective since 1694http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aosp/1617/16/contents, whereas HM Land Registry is incomplete https://hmlandregistry.blog.gov.uk/2018/02/05/search- owner-unregistered-land/ and a compulsory public declaration is a more recent requirement. Council Tax is slightly easier to evade than domestic rates as liability for Council Tax falls on the occupants rather than the property owner - the UK does not have a complete identity register therefore Councils must rely on other forms of identification - such as the electoral roll to identify, locate and pursue Council Tax evaders. Rates were abolished in Scotland in 1989 and replaced with the Community Charge which was in turn replaced by the Council Tax as in England and Wales. Since devolution, there have been attempts to replace Council Tax in Scotland with a Local income tax and a Land Value Tax. Business rates Rates on non-residential property (business rates) are still charged, at a uniform rate set by central government. Rates are collected by local councils, and were, until recently distributed nationally. Each Local Authority now keeps the money they collect meaning that some Local Authorities collect a disproportionate amount when compared to number of residents Rating assessments (rateable values) are made on all non-domestic properties. As well as business, this includes village halls and other non-business occupations. The exception to this is where a hereditament is exempt by virtue of Schedule 6 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 which specifies exempt classes. The rateable value should represent the reasonable rental value of the occupation according to the circumstances at the \\"Material Day\\" and according to rental values at the \\"Antecedent Valuation Date\\". (For the compiled 2005 Rating List the \\"Material Day\\" is 1 April 2005 and the \\"Antecedent Valuation Date\\" is 1 April 2003). Later physical changes will have a later Material Day but the Antecedent Valuation Date will still be 1 April 2003 for the currency of the 2005 Rating List. The Rating List is a public document. Other rates Taxes raised for other purposes are also called rates in the United Kingdom. A specific example is the drainage rate charged to fund drainage work which protects low-lying areas from flooding. The first Act of Parliament to authorise the collection of drainage rates was the Statute of Sewers, passed by King Henry VIII in 1531, which established a principle of no benefit, no rates. This hampered the work of drainage authorities for four centuries, since the number of people who already received direct benefit from initial, new network works would be nil or very few and unconnected people with non-mobile homes could object to contributing to new schemes, citing the principle. The concept was finally overturned by the Land Drainage Act 1930, which repealed 20 Acts from Henry's Act of 1531 to the Land Drainage Act of 1929, and created Catchment Boards, who were responsible for complete river systems, and could charge drainage rates to people living throughout the catchment. Whereas agricultural land is normally excluded from rating, drainage rates are collected from all occupiers of agricultural land and buildings within a drainage district. This principle was enshrined in the Land Drainage Act 1991.

The device attempted to mimic the rhythm of uterine contractions, which were thought to have a role in stimulating fetal breathing. The device was developed by Dr. Allan Bloxsom, a pediatrician at St. Joseph Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. At its peak, the device was utilized in more than 700 hospitals. In 1956, six years after its introduction, the Bloxsom air lock produced unfavorable results in a clinical trial. By that time physicians had also become leery of the link between high-concentration oxygen and eye disease in premature babies, and the device fell out of favor. The Bloxsom air lock is sometimes cited as an example of technology that gained wide acceptance following inadequate evaluation. Development and acceptance Allan Bloxsom was a pediatrician at St. Joseph Hospital and a faculty member at Baylor College of Medicine. In the early 1940s, he noted that babies born by cesarean section required resuscitation at birth more often than those born by vaginal delivery. Writing a 1942 article for The Journal of Pediatrics, Bloxsom hypothesized that the uterus played an important role in the initiation of breathing at birth. He thought that contractions of the uterus stimulated the fetal respiratory center, possibly by \\"the alternate forcing and drawing of blood from the fetal circulation by compressing the placenta.\\" He also noted that uterine compression of the fetus, followed by the release of that pressure, might promote breathing in the baby born by vaginal delivery. Bloxsom developed the air lock device based on his assumptions about the role of uterine contractions in establishing effective breathing at birth. The air lock was a sealed steel cylinder that delivered warmed and humidified 60% oxygen to newly born babies. The device has been compared to an iron lung, but it did not utilize negative pressure. The pressure inside the chamber alternated between 0.07 and 0.2 atmospheres above sea level. Rather than alternating the pressures at the rate of normal respirations as other devices did, the Bloxsom air lock cycled the pressure once per minute to mimic the rate of uterine contractions in late labor. Babies in distress were placed in the chamber immediately after delivery. The device was rolled out in 1950. That year, Bloxsom presented a talk on the device at an American Medical Association conference. That led to the air lock being featured in Newsweek, which referred to the device as the \\"Plexiglass Mother\\". A Houston company developed a Plexiglass model. In 1952, U.S. Army physicians shared their experience with the device, writing that the air lock was a valuable resuscitation device and that on occasion it appeared to be lifesaving. Though the apparatus was large and loud, one pediatrician pointed out that the infant was protected from \\"meddlesome and unintelligent treatment\\" while locked inside the chamber. The air lock, which sold for about $1,000 per unit, was used in more than 700 hospitals by the fall of 1952. Decline Dr. Virginia Apgar co-authored a 1953 study that was critical of the device. In a 1951 article in The Medical Journal of Australia, pediatrician Kate Isabel Campbell advanced a theory that there was a link between oxygen administration and the occurrence of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in preterm infants. ROP had become an increasingly common cause of blindness among newborns. The next year, trials in Europe and the United States linked excessive oxygen and ROP more definitively, though an ideal level of oxygen administration was not clear and there was still no way to monitor an infant's arterial oxygen levels. In 1953, Virginia Apgar and Joseph Kreiselman conducted a study in which they placed anesthesized dogs inside the chamber. They found that the device did not improve the exchange of carbon dioxide or oxygen in these dogs. Dr. Bloxsom and Sister Mary Angelique published a response to the criticism, pointing out that the device was never intended to help apneic dogs. The next year, Bloxsom and Angelique published an article in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology on the 48-hour mortality rate among newborns at St. Joseph. Between 1949 and 1952, this rate had decreased from 63 per 10,000 infants to 37 per 10,000 infants. Bloxsom and Angelique cited the air lock device as a contributor to the improvement in outcomes. However, a 1956 study from Johns Hopkins Hospital failed to show a significant difference in outcomes between infants treated in the Bloxsom air lock versus those cared for in the Isolette brand of incubator. Following the publication of the study at Johns Hopkins, and as physicians became aware of the link between high- concentration oxygen and eye disease in newborns, the device fell out of favor in the late 1950s. A small number of hospitals continued to utilize the device into the early 1970s. In 2001, Kending et al. wrote, \\"The Bloxsom AL device experienced a precipitous birth, a rapid acceptance and proliferation of usage, a rapid death, and now extinction.\\" The authors noted that the device was seen as a status symbol by many hospitals, which led these centers to utilize it before it had undergone enough evaluation.

U.S. officials later clarify that the strike was carried out via both drone and manned aircraft, with U.S. special operations forces destroying a vehicle and training camp using laser-guided munitions and Hellfire missiles. According to a U.S. government source, a Twitter account that was linked by American authorities to Al-Shabaab also declared that Godane had died during the raid. While the Arabic tweet's authenticity is being analyzed, Godane does not appear in any social media or other public outlet to confirm that he is still alive.

President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud states that all of Godane's companions were also killed during the operation, which he indicates was conducted with the full knowledge and consent of the Somali federal government. He also reiterates his administration's 45-day offer of amnesty to all moderate Al-Shabaab members who choose to renounce violence and disavow links with the insurgent group and its Al-Qaeda affiliate. Additionally, Prime Minister of Somalia Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed announces that the attack was targeting Godane's convoy near the town of Haawaay, and was an official joint operation between U.S. and Somali forces. He likewise asserts that the insurgent commander's death will help the reconstruction efforts in Somalia to proceed unimpeded.

However, a Western diplomat within the compound states that its walls were not penetrated. Mohamed Abdi, a policeman at the adjacent airport, also reports hearing explosions. Total casualties are uncertain. According to Houmed, five of the attackers were killed, with three gunned down and two blowing themselves up beside a fuel depot; the remaining three militants may have escaped. UN spokesman Aleem Siddique likewise states that all UN personnel are safe. Additionally, roads leading to the airport have been sealed. According to AMISOM, five of its troops as well as one foreign contractor were killed during the attack. Ambassador Maman Sidikou adds that the attackers were wearing military fatigues, and that access to the facility will hereafter be tightened. AMISOM spokesman Houmed later clarifies that only two of the militants had absconded, but they were eventually besieged within the compound's underground holes that they had fled to. He likewise indicates that AMISOM troops are now in full control of the base, and that the authorities have launched a probe into the attack. Ministry of National Security spokesman Mohamed Yusuf announces a few hours later that government forces and AMISOM have captured the four surviving Al-Shabaab militants who attacked the base. =December 27= *A Somali intelligence officer indicates that senior Al- Shabaab commander Zakariya Ismail Ahmed Hersi has surrendered to local police in the southwestern Gedo province. According to the official, Hersi may have turned himself in after having fallen out earlier in the year with other Al- Shabaab members loyal to the group's late leader Godane. =December 29= *Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops capture a series of towns in the central Hiran province from Al-Shabaab. Among the liberated areas are Mirgab, Anfac, Burweyn, Hero Lugole, Rahale, Jar and Janbiley. According to Col. Mohamud Mohamed Qafow, the joint forces are also aiming to deliver a supply convoy to Bulo Barde. Additionally, national army soldiers are dispatched to Jalalaqsi in the Middle Shabelle province to help the AU garrison. *The U.S. Pentagon announces that its jets have conducted an airstrike targeting a senior Al-Shabaab commander in Somalia. Military spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby does not specify the identity of the targeted insurgent leader, but indicates that the raid was carried out in the southern town of Saakow. He adds that U.S. security personnel have not discerned any civilian casualties, and that they are still gauging the strike's relative impact. Somalia's National Intelligence and Security Agency announces a few hours later that the raid killed the Al-Shabaab intelligence chief Abdishakur (Tahlil). According to security officials, the slain militant leader was part of a unit that was tasked with carrying out suicide attacks. He had reportedly been assigned the position only a couple of days prior, after his predecessor Zakariya Ahmed Ismail Hersi turned himself in to police in the southwestern Gedo region. The spy agency also indicates that two other Al-Shabaab insurgents were killed during the airstrike. Pentagon press secretary Kirby later confirms that Tahliil Abdishakur was killed by Hellfire missiles that were fired by an unmanned U.S. aircraft. Given the fact that Tahliil served as the head of Al-Shabaab's elite Amniyat unit, Kirby suggests that the militant's death will substantially impact Al-Shabaab's ability to effectively carry out attacks against government, civilian and international targets.
