He is best known for \\"Taking a Chance on Love\\" with lyrics by Ted Fetter and John Latouche (1940), \\"I Can't Get Started\\" with lyrics by Ira Gershwin (1936), \\"April in Paris\\" with lyrics by E. Y. (\\"Yip\\") Harburg (1932), and \\"What Is There To Say\\" for the Ziegfeld Follies of 1934, also with Harburg. He wrote the words and music for \\"Autumn in New York\\" (1934) for the revue Thumbs Up! Vernon collaborated with lyricists such as Johnny Mercer, Ira Gershwin, Ogden Nash and Sammy Cahn. Early life Vladimir Aleksandrovich Dukelsky (Russian: –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –î—É–∫–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏–π) was born in 1903 into a noble family of mixed Georgian-Austrian-Spanish-Russian descent, in Parafianovo, Vilna Governorate, Russian Empire (in present-day Belarus). The 1954 Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians referred to \\"one of his grandparents\\" (Princess Tumanishvili) as having been \\"directly descended from the kings of Georgia\\". His birthplace was a small railroad station in Minsk Governorate. At that time his mother \\"happened to be traveling by train\\".Vernon Duke. Passport to Paris, Boston- Toronto: Little, Brown and Co., 1955, pg. 6. The Dukelskys resided in Kiev, and Vladimir's only visit to Saint Petersburg and Moscow occurred in the summer of 1915. The impressions of that remarkable summer were later echoed in Dukelsky's most daring classical composition, the Russian oratorio The End of St. Petersburg (1931‚Äì37). The title is a reference to the film The End of St. Petersburg directed by Vsevolod Pudovkin. At the age of 11, Dukelsky was admitted to the Kiev Conservatory where he studied composition with Reinhold Gli√®re and musical theory with Boleslav Yavorsky. In 1919, his family escaped from the turmoil of civil war in Russia and spent a year and a half with other refugees in Constantinople. In 1921, they obtained American visas and sailed steerage class on the SS King Alexander to New York. He underwent his immigrant inspection at Ellis Island; on the passenger list, the purser of the King Alexander recorded his name as Vladimir Doukelsky in the French fashion. It was in 1922 in New York that George Gershwin befriended the young immigrant; Gershwin (himself born Jacob Gershowitz) suggested Dukelsky truncate and Americanize his name. Dukelsky's first songs published under his nom de plume were conceived that year, but he continued to write classical music and Russian poetry under his given name until 1955. Career In 1924, the restless young man left hospitable America for the Old World. In Paris, he received a commission from Serge Diaghilev to compose a ballet. Dukelsky's first theatrical production, Zephyr and Flora, was staged in the 1925 season of Ballets Russes, with choreography by L√©onide Massine and scenography by Georges Braque, to great critical acclaim. In a review of musical novelties of the season, Sergei Prokofiev described it as full of \\"superior melodies, very well designed, harmonically beautiful and not too 'modernist'.\\" Prokofiev was as impressed with the young talent as Diaghilev was, and soon the composers became close friends. They frequently saw each other until the end of the 1930s and corresponded until 1946, when the attacks of Soviet officialdom on Prokofiev (who returned to Russia in 1938 although Duke urged him not to go) made the further exchange of letters too dangerous for Prokofiev. Dukelsky's First Symphony was premiered by Serge Koussevitzky and his orchestra in 1928 in Paris on the same bill as the excerpts from Prokofiev's The Fiery Angel. Some of Dukelsky's and Prokofiev's compositions of the 1930s bear evidence of the sustaining musical dialogue. In the late 1920s, Dukelsky shared his time between Paris, where his more classical works were performed, and London where he composed numbers for musical comedies under the pen name of Vernon Duke. In 1929, he returned to the United States with an intention of settling in the country permanently. He composed and published much serious music, but devoted even greater efforts to establishing himself on Broadway. Duke's songs \\"April in Paris\\" (1932), \\"Autumn in New York\\" (1934), \\"I Like the Likes of You\\" (1934), \\"Water Under the Bridge\\" (1934), \\"I Can't Get Started\\" (1936) were 1930s hits. The support and devotion of Serge Koussevitzky, who published Dukelsky's chamber music and conducted his orchestral scores, helped him develop his more classical works. Dukelsky's concerto for piano, orchestra and soprano obbligato titled D√©dicaces (1935‚Äì1937), was premi√®red by Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra in January 1939 in New York. His oratorio, The End of St. Petersburg, was premiered a year earlier by Schola Cantorum and the New York Philharmonic under Hugh Ross. In 1937, the composer was asked to complete Gershwin's last score, a soundtrack to a Technicolor extravaganza The Goldwyn Follies, for which he contributed two parody ballets, choreographed by George Balanchine, and a song \\"Spring Again\\". In 1939, Dukelsky became an American citizen and took Vernon Duke as his legal name. Duke's greatest success came a year later, with the Broadway musical Cabin in the Sky (1940), choreographed by George Balanchine and performed by an all-black cast at the Martin Beck Theater in New York. =Military service= Between 1942 and 1944, he joined the Coast Guard and, while in service he discovered Sid Caesar, a saxophone player in the Coast Guard Band, and wrote a touring show for the Coast Guard called Tars & Spars. He also conceived some of his finest music in the classical tradition, including a Cello Concerto (commissioned by Gregor Piatigorsky) and a Violin Concerto. =Third Symphony= His pensive Third Symphony (1946) was dedicated to the memory of Koussevitzky's wife, Natalie. With years, both Serge and Natalie Koussevitzky, Dukelsky's devoted supporters, had become a sort of surrogate family to him. When Dukelsky's own mother died in 1942, the composer took the conductor's refusal to officially commission this work with great bitterness. The dedication was revoked and the relationship soured. In 1946, Duke left the United States for France, where he continued his double career of being a classical composer and a songwriter (now setting to music the texts of French lyricists). By 1948, the composer was back in America. He moved from New York to California where he spent his last decades, writing songs, film and theater scores, chamber music, poetry in Russian and polemical articles and memoirs in English. On October 30, 1957, he married singer Kay McCracken. His final appearance on Broadway came less than two weeks later with the two songs and incidental music he wrote for the Helen Hayes show, Jean Anouilh's Time Remembered (1940) (French title: L√©ocadia) which ran for 247 performances. He continued to try to mount Broadway musicals during the last decade of his life, including two shows that closed during tryouts, and one was never produced. =Later works= As a classical composer, Dukelsky used the same musical language as his modernist contemporaries Sergei Prokofiev, Arthur Louri√©, and, to a lesser extent, Igor Stravinsky. His harmonies, however, were highly original. As a songwriter and author of theatrical and film music, he was close to George Gershwin and Harold Arlen, but developed an idiosyncratic voice of his own. Death Duke died in Santa Monica, California on 16 January 1969, during surgery for lung cancer. His numerous papers ‚Äî musical and literary manuscripts and correspondence in English, French, and Russian ‚Äî are now stored in the Musical Division of the Library of Congress.

The cemetery is a site of legends and night tours. It opened in 1848 and was formally closed in 1896.History of Santa Paula Cemetery (see page 4)  History  Egyptian Chapel in the Bel√©n Cemetery of Guadalajara Until the construction of the Rotonda de los Jaliscienses Ilustres the cemetery housed the memorial for major historical figures from Jalisco. Its original name was Santa Paula Cemetery and it was a project by Fray Antonio Alcalde. Guadalajara suffered of a large number of epidemics and the conventional hospitals were unable to support the demand for medical attention. In 1737, the Spanish crown requested to the Oidor Marqu√©s de Altamira Don Juan Rodr√≠guez de Albuerne, information about the number of patients at the Betlemitas Hospital. On March 8, 1751, the crown granted permission to relocate the Hospital. King Ferdinand VI requested the blueprints and granted funds to build a new Hospital. Guadalajara faced a large famine in 1786 (A√±o del hambre). The old Hospital was not large enough to treat the number of patients. On May 3, 1793 the Hospital of Bel√©n was inaugurated. After the Independence War, Guadalajara faced a large number of famines and epidemic diseases like in 1833. Cholera killed a large percentage of the population. Guadalajara required a new Cemetery outside the populated areas. The gardens closer to the Hospital were used to build the cemetery, that's why it is known as \\"Panteon de Belen\\". Guadalajara, Pante√≥n de Bel√©n, North Area The cemetery was projected by the architect Manuel G√≥mez Ibarra in 1848. The Panteon de Belen was divided in 2 areas. The common area and the section reserved to the wealthy. Santa Paula Cemetery received this name because the chapel in the middle of the high-class part of the cemetery was dedicated to her. Under the chapel there's a mausoleum where the remains of the most important figures in the city's history were kept until 1957, when all the remains interred there were transferred to a new area known as the Rotonda de los Jaliscienses Ilustres. The common area has disappeared and was turned into the Tower of Medical Specialities for the Hospital (Now Called The \\"Old\\" Civilian Hospital and owned by the University of Guadalajara); but the wealthy part was re-opened and many legends were created to draw attention to it as some sort of \\"museum of the macabre\\".  Legends  Legends of: The Vampire, The Pirate, The Lovers, The Monk, The Child afraid of the Dark, The Story of Jos√© Cuervo, The Nun and many more, have surfaced and are part of the local folklore. Many ghost sightings have been recorded but some think is just some form of mass-hysteria, still the Mexican cultural attraction to the dead draws dozens of people to the daytime and nighttime tours, especially on November 2. Fen-om, a non-profit organization dedicated to haring facts of Mexican culture, focuses on the Pante√≥n de Bel√©n as part of quarterly tours of the city of Guadalajara. Many of the traditional tales of the graveyard can be found as part of the itinerary of its 7-day-a-week tours.

Suleiman was one of five sons of Mohammed III who fought a civil war for control of the kingdom. Slimane emerged victorious in 1795, and the country remained largely passive for the subsequent decades of his rule. He was a member of the Alaouite dynasty. Suleiman continued his father's centralization and expansion of the kingdom, and most notably ended the piracy that had long operated from Morocco's coast. As part of Morocco's long running conflict with Spain and Portugal, Suleiman halted all trade with Europe. However, he continued his father's policies of close relations with the United States. Sultan Suleiman presented the United States with a two- storey mud and stone building in Tangier, the country's first acquired property. It would house the American Legation and Consulate for 140 years. Mulay Suleiman is also the author of some works. Most famous his Inayat Ula li al-Majd. It is dedicated to one of his teachers, Mohammed ibn Abd al-Salam al- Fasi and discusses the origins of the Fasi al-Fihris. Another famous essay is his Hawashi 'ala Sharh al-Kharshi a work on religion.

Descendants of Ofo (Siouan- speakers), Avoyel (a Natchez people), and Choctaw (Muskogean) are also enrolled in the tribe. In the 21st century, the people speak mostly English and French. Many live on the Tunica-Biloxi Indian Reservation () in central Avoyelles Parish, just south of the city of Marksville, Louisiana, and overlapping its boundaries. The Reservation is . The 2010 census lists 951 persons self-identified as at least partly of Tunica-Biloxi, with 669 of those identifying as solely of Tunica-Biloxi ancestry. History By the Middle Mississippian period, local Late Woodland peoples in the Central Mississippi Valley had developed or adopted a Mississippian lifestyle, with maize agriculture, hierarchical political structures, mussel shell-tempered pottery, and participation in the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC). The archaeological evidence suggests that the valley was home to several competing paramount chiefdoms, with supporting vassal states. The groups in the area have been defined by archaeologists by archaeological phases; these include the Menard, Tipton, Belle Meade-Walls, Parkin and Nodena phases. In the spring of 1541 Hernando de Soto and his army approached the eastern bank of the Mississippi River, coming upon the Province of Quizquiz (pronounced \\"keys- key\\"). These people spoke a dialect of the Tunica language, which is a language isolate. At that time, these related groups covered a large region extending along both sides of the Mississippi River in present-day Mississippi and Arkansas, as the expedition would soon learn. Parkin Site, circa 1539. (also known as province of Casqui.) Illustration by Herb Roe Based on evaluations of the three surviving de Soto narratives for topography, linguistics and cultural traits, combined with archaeological excavations and analysis, most archaeologists and ethnohistorians have agreed to identify the Menard, Walls, Belle Meade, Parkin and Nodena phases as the de Soto-named provinces of Anilco, Quizquiz, Aquixo, Casqui and Pacaha, respectively. It was 150 years before another European group recorded the Tunica. In 1699 the LaSource expedition (coming downriver from French Canada) encountered the Tunica, describing them as a modestly sized tribe numbering only a few hundred warriors. They and other peoples had suffered from smallpox epidemics, which had high mortality rates as they had no natural immunity to this new disease carried by Europeans. By the time the French arrived, the Central Mississippi Valley was sparsely occupied by the Quapaw. They became significant allies to the French and aided their successful settlement. The French established a mission among the Tunica around 1700, on the Yazoo River. Father Antoine Davion was assigned to the Tunica, as well as to the smaller tribes of the Koroa, Yazoo, and Housp√© tribes. The Tunica were skilled traders and entrepreneurs, especially in the manufacture and distribution of salt, a valuable item to both native and Europeans. Salt was extremely important in the trade between the French and the various Caddoan groups in what are now northwestern Louisiana and southwestern Arkansas. The Tunica were believed to be the middlemen in the trade of salt from the Caddoan areas to the French. By the early 18th century, the tribes along the lower Mississippi River were a target of Chickasaw raids for the English slave trade in South Carolina. By 1706 the Tunica decided to move. As their enemies the Natchez were to their immediate south, they moved to the Mississippi side of the Mississippi and Red River confluence. This allowed them to keep control of their salt trade, as the Red River also connected to their salt source in the Caddoan areas. They established a loose collection of hamlets and villages at present-day Angola, Louisiana. The archeological remains of a small hamlet from this time period were discovered in 1976 by an inmate of Angola Prison. It is known as the Bloodhound Site. During the 1710s and 1720s, war periodically broke out between the French and the Natchez. The last uprising in 1729, the Natchez Massacre, was the largest; the Natchez killed most of the French at the village of Natchez and Fort Rosalie. French colonists gained the aid of Indian allies and returned to the villages, killing or capturing most of the Natchez. The survivors were sold into slavery. In 1729 the chiefs of the village sent emissaries to potential allies, including the Yazoo, Koroa, Illinois, Chickasaw, and Choctaw. The Natchez Rebellion or Natchez War expanded into a larger regional conflict with many repercussions. The Tunica were initially reluctant to fight on either side. In June 1730 the Head Chief of the Tunica, Cahura-Joligo, agreed to let a small party of Natchez refugees settle near his village (present-day Angola), provided they were unarmed. A few days later, the chief of the Natchez arrived at the Tunica village with a hundred men, and an unknown number of women and children. They concealed Chickasaw and Koroa warriors in the canebrake around the village. Cahura-Joligo informed the Natchez party that he could not receive them unless they gave up their arms. They said they intended to do so, but asked to keep their arms a while longer. He consented and had food distributed to his new guests. A dance was held that night. After the dance and when the village had gone to sleep, the Natchez, Chicasaw and Koroa attacked their hosts. Cahura-Joligo killed four Natchez during the fighting, but was killed along with 12 of his warriors. His war- chief Brides les Boeufs (Buffalo Tamer) repulsed the attack. He rallied the warriors, and after fighting for five days and nights, regained control of the village. Twenty Tunica were killed and as many wounded in the fighting. They killed 33 of the Natchez warriors. After the attack at Angola, in 1731 the Tunica moved a few miles away to the Trudeau site. Over the years, they buried as grave goods large amounts of European trade goods, including beads, porcelain, muskets, kettles and other items, as well as locally produced pottery in the Tunica tribal style. When discovered in the 20th century, these artifacts attested to their extensive trade with Europeans, as well as the wealth of the Tunica. They stayed at this location into the 1760s, when the French ceded control west of the Mississippi to the Spanish following the French defeat by the British in the Seven Years' War.The Treaty of Paris in Tunica Trail from the Central Mississippi valley to Marksville, LA In 1764 the Tunica moved south of the Trudeau Landing site to just outside the French settlement at Pointe Coup√©e, Louisiana. Other tribes had also settled in the area, including the Offagoula, Pascagoula and Biloxi. The latter came to have a close relationship with the Tunica people. During this time, numerous Anglo- American settlers migrated into the region, as the British had taken over former French territories east of the Mississippi River. The Tunica had become acculturated to European ways, although they still tattooed themselves and practiced some of their native religious customs. With the British in charge of the Western Florida colony at this time, and the Spanish in control of Louisiana, politics were volatile in the area. In 1779 Governor Galvez led a force, which included Tunica and other tribal warriors, to take the British- held town of Baton Rouge. This was the last military campaign for which the Tunica were recorded. By sometime in the late 1780s or 1790s, the Tunica moved again, probably because of the large influx of Anglo-Americans moving into the area. They moved west to a site on the Red River named Avoyelles. In 1794 Marco Litche (recorded by the French as Marc Eliche), a Sephardic Jewish trader from Venice, established a trading post in the area. A European- American settlement developed around the post and became known as Marksville. It was noted on Louisiana maps as of 1809. After acquisition by US Marksville was a good location for a trading post, as the Red River was still an important avenue of trade. But rapid changes took place. Under Napoleon Bonaparte, France reacquired the area in 1800. After failing to regain power in its colony of Saint-Domingue, France sold the large territory known as the Louisiana Purchase to the fledgling United States in 1803. Anglo-Americans migrated to Louisiana in great numbers, mostly from the southern United States, eventually changing its culture to one dominated by the English language and Protestant Christianity, especially in the northern parts of the area. In the late 19th century, railroads surpassed the rivers as main avenues of trade and transportation, and the Marksville area became a quiet backwater. The only U.S. government mention of the Tunica from 1803 to 1938 was made in 1806 by an Indian Commissioner for Louisiana. He noted that the Tunica numbered only about 25 men, lived in Avoyelles Parish, and made their livings by occasionally hiring out as boatmen. Although the Tunica were prosperous at this time, eventually problems with their white neighbors would take its toll. The whites imposed the binary social system based on slavery as a racial caste, recognizing only whites and blacks (in which they classified all people of color). They also tended to discount Indian identity among mixed-race people, failing to understand that they identified culturally and socially as Tunica. By the late 19th century, the dominant white conservative Democrats imposed legal racial segregation after disenfranchising blacks and other minorities of color. The Tunica became subsistence farmers, with some hunting and fishing to support themselves. Others turned to sharecropping on their white neighbors' land. As the 20th century dawned, the Tunica came together around their ancient heritage. They had managed to retain possession of the majority of their communal land, some still spoke the Tunica language, and they still practiced traditional tribal ceremonies. 20th century to present Gradually the remnant descendants of other local tribes (the Ofo, Avoyel, Choctaw, and Biloxi) merged into the Tunica. They have preserved much of their ethnic identity, maintaining their tribal government and the hereditary chieftainship up to the mid-1970s. The modern Tunica-Biloxi tribe, which has a written constitution and elected government, was recognized by the federal government in 1981. They live in Mississippi and east central Louisiana. The modern tribe is composed of Tunica, Biloxi (a Siouan-speaking people from the Gulf coast), Ofo (also a Siouan people), Avoyel (a Natchezan people), and Mississippi Choctaw. Many live on the Tunica-Biloxi Indian Reservation in central Avoyelles Parish, just south of the city of Marksville, Louisiana. A part of the city extends onto reservation land. The reservation has a land area of . Currently, they operate Louisiana's first land based casino, Paragon Casino Resort, opened in Marksville in June 1994. The casino is known for its contributions back to its members. The 2000 census lists 648 persons identified as Tunica. Tribal government currently consists of an elected tribal council and tribal chairman. The tribe maintains its own police force, health services, education department, housing authority, and court system. Former tribal chairman Earl J. Barbry, Sr., was widely noted as one of the longest-serving chairmen in Indian Country, serving from 1978 until his death in July 2013. Barbry was succeeded as chairman by Marshall Pierite, formerly vice chairman of the tribe, from August 2013 through April 2014. Barbry's son, Joey Barbry, served as chairman from April 2014. Marshall Pierite again became chairman upon his election in April 2018. =Tunica treasure= In the 1960s a treasure hunter named Leonard Charrier began searching for artifacts at the Trudeau Landing site in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana. The Tunica, who felt he had stolen tribal heirlooms and desecrated the graves of their ancestors, were outraged. In the 1970s the site was excavated by archaeologists, uncovering large amounts of pottery, European trade goods and other artifacts deposited as grave goods by the Tunica from 1731 to 1764 when they occupied the site. With help from the State of Louisiana, the tribe filed suit to gain title to the artifacts, which has subsequently become known as the \\"Tunica treasure\\". The case took a decade to be decided in the courts, but the ruling became a landmark in American Indian history. It helped to lay the groundwork for new federal legislation, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), passed in 1990. Because the artifacts had been separated from the original burials and connections were lost, the tribe decided to build a museum to house these items. Members of the tribe were trained as conservators in order to repair damage done to the artifacts by the centuries underground and handling during the ten-year court battle. The museum was built in the shape of the ancient temple mounds of their people, with the earthen structure to take the symbolic place of the original burial underground. It opened in 1989 as The Tunica- Biloxi Regional Indian Center and Museum. Due to structural problems, it was closed in 1999, with plans for a new larger facility underway. Today the Tunica Treasure collection is housed in the Tunica-Biloxi Cultural and Educational Resources Center, a state-of-the-art facility that includes a library, conservation center, distance-learning center, conference facilities, tribal offices, and museum on the tribal reservation in Marksville. Eighty percent of the artifacts of the Tunica Treasure have been restored.Dana Bowker Lee, \\"Louisiana Indians in the 21st Century\\", Louisiana Folklife, 18 October 2013 =Federal recognition= Formal efforts to be recognized by the federal government were begun in the 1940s when Chief Eli Barbry, Horace Pierite, Clarence Jackson, and Sam Barbry traveled to Washington, D.C. to consult with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Federal recognition would have entitled the tribe to benefit from social programs under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. A succession of chiefs, including Chief Horace Pierite Sr, would work at the task. With the Tunica treasure proving their ancient tribal identity, the tribe was able to gain state and federal recognition. They were recognized by the United States government in 1981 as the Tunica Biloxi Indians of Louisiana, later taking the name of Tunica-Biloxi Indian Tribe. = Economic development = The Tunica-Biloxi Tribe operates Louisiana's first land-based casino, Paragon Casino Resort. It opened in Marksville in June 1994. It is now the largest employer in Avoyelles Parish. The Tribe also owns and operates a Tribal Lending Enterprise‚Äîthe online installment loan company, Mobiloans‚Äîand a finance and production company, Acacia Entertainment. Mobiloans works with Think Finance on underwriting, loan servicing, and other technology processes related to running the business. Acacia Entertainment is a joint venture between the Tribe's Economic Development Corporation and film producer Matthew George. According to the Tribe, Acacia aims to produce two to three films per year. Tunica and Biloxi languages Tunica languageBiloxi language The Tunica (or Tonica, or less common form Yuron) language is a language isolate. The Tunica tribe historically lived close to the Ofo and Avoyeles tribes, but communication among the three depended on their use of the Mobilian Jargon or French.Haas, Mary R. Tunica. New York: J.J. Augustin Publisher, 1940. The last known native speaker of the Tunica language, Sesostrie Youchigant, died in 1948. Linguist Mary Haas had worked with Youchigant in the 1930s to describe what he remembered of the language. She published the description in A Grammar of the Tunica Language in 1941, followed by Tunica Texts in 1950, and Tunica Dictionary in 1953. Tunica is a reawakening language, with immersion programs and youth summer camps teaching second-language learners. The Biloxi language is a Siouan language which was at one time spoken by the Biloxi people in Louisiana and southeast Texas. The Biloxi were first noted in European records as living along the Biloxi Bay in the mid-17th century, but by the mid-18th century, they had migrated into Louisiana to avoid European encroachment. Some were also noted in Texas in the early 19th century.\\"Biloxi Indian Tribe History.\\" Access Genealogy. Retrieved 22 Feb 2009. By the early 19th century their numbers had dwindled.

It is part of the Waimakariri District and is a linear town, approximately long. Originally, it was served by the Oxford Branch railway, and had two stations, East Oxford and West Oxford. The line closed in 1959 and was dismantled. Some railway signs and the remnants of railway platforms can still be seen along Oxford Road on the way to Rangiora. It was originally a logging town: trees were felled from forests in the area, and hauled by beast to Christchurch.

Naming It is unclear whether the town is named after Oxford in England or after its university, but it is more probable that it was named after Samuel Wilberforce, who was the Bishop of Oxford from 1845 to 1870. It was named by the chief surveyor of the Canterbury Association, Joseph Thomas, in 1849. The town of Tƒ´rau in the North Island was originally also named Oxford, in a name pairing with Cambridge 30 km to the west. Owing to confusion between the two towns, the North Island town was later renamed Oxford North before adopting its current name in 1895. Education The town has one school, Oxford Area School. It is a state composite (Year 1‚Äì13) school with a role of The principal is Mike Hart.  Demographics  In 2006, Oxford had a population of 1728, growing to 1929 in 2013 and 2214 in 2018. The median age of the residents in 2018 was 45.1 years old. In terms of ethnicity, 95.3% of residents identified as European, 6.6% identified as Maori and 9.3% identified as of Maori descent. The majority of residents were born in New Zealand (80%). The majority of residents identified with no religion (52.6%) while a sizeable minority (36.2%) identified as Christian. Some residents (41.5%) were in full time employment. The median income was $26,900 with 13% earning over $70,000. In 2018, there were 867 occupied private dwellings and a further 60 unoccupied private dwellings.  Community  Looking east The Town Hall before earthquake renovations The community saved hard during 2005 and 2006 to raise funds for projects such as the Oxford Community Pool, a community-based swimming pool in Burnett Street, and a first-response ambulance. The town prides itself on its ability to self- fund community projects through organizations such as the Lions. Oxford has several Churches and organisations: > Oxford Union Church (Presbyterian) > Oxford Baptist Church > Sacred Heart Catholic Church > Seventh Day Adventist Church > Anglican Church > Tawera Masonic Lodge > Oxford Working Men‚Äôs Club > West Oxford Hotel (Public House - The West) > Transport Oxford was linked to Christchurch in 1878 by the narrow-gauge Oxford Branch from Oxford West to Rangiora to meet the broad gauge from Christchurch. With the gauge conversion of 1878, it became easier to transfer passengers and freight from the branch line to Christchurch, though passengers still had to change at Rangiora from the Waipara train to the branch train. The branch stretched from Rangiora through Bennetts Junction (where the Eyreton Branch joined), Oxford and Sheffield. This necessitated a high road- rail bridge across the Waimakariri Gorge. From Oxford to Sheffield closed in 1931 along with the Eyreton Branch, leaving the Oxford branch as a rural branch line. It lost its passenger service in the 1940s. Due to declining revenue, the branch closed on 31 May 1959 and the track was sold to Scotts Engineering of Christchurch, which used the rails from several branch lines to build farm sheds. The line was latterly worked by the A and AB class 4-6-2 and C class 2-6-2 tender locomotives. No diesel locomotives or railcars are known to have used the branch, although thought was given in the 1940s to running a small railcar.  Oxford Benevolent and Improvement League  The OB&I; was formed during World War I to provide charitable support to war widows. To raise money, it showed films in the old Oxford Town Hall. It provides charitable support to the citizens of Oxford. Movies are screened in the Town Hall approximately every other Saturday during the winter. The heyday of the OB&I; movies was the middle of the 20th century, when three or four films would be shown every week and queues often extended around the building. This was before private car ownership became popular, as the nearest cinema was in Christchurch, some 50 km distant. The Oxford Town hall, where movies were shown, was closed, along with several other Council operated buildings, in late 2011, as the building was determined to be earthquake prone.http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch- earthquake-2011/6151119/Quake-damage-closes-six-buildings The Oxford Town hall was reopened on 19 February 2015.http://www.waimakariri.govt.nz/leisure-and- recreation/facilities/halls-and-meeting-venues/oxford-town-hall  Renovation of Main Street  Oxford town hall after earthquake renovations New Township Entry Sign During 2009, Main Street underwent a major renovation with the road resurfaced, pedestrian refuges in strategic locations and new footpaths with garden beds. The old welcome signs were replaced with new \\"Experience Oxford\\" signs at east and west entries. This project was a joint undertaking by the Waimakariri District Council and the Oxford Promotions and Action Committee (OPAC), but they ran out of money and did not finish both sides of the street. Books about Oxford There are a number of books about Oxford. Littledene: a New Zealand rural community https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/littledene published in 1938 is perhaps the most comprehensive; the book is a \\"sociological study of a typical New Zealand small town\\", with the fictional name of Littledene, but the research and details of the book all relate to Oxford.

Arms of Frederick the Fair as King of the Romans. Frederick the Handsome () or the Fair (c. 1289 ‚Äì 13 January 1330), from the House of Habsburg, was Duke of Austria and Styria from 1308 as Frederick I as well as King of Germany (King of the Romans) from 1314 (anti-king until 1325) as Frederick III until his death. Biography He was born in Vienna, the second son of King Albert I of Germany by his wife Elisabeth of Gorizia-Tyrol, a scion of the Meinhardiner dynasty, and thereby a grandson of the first Habsburg king of Germany Rudolph I. =Duke of Austria= Still a minor, he and his elder brother Rudolph III had been vested with the duchies of Austria and Styria by their father in 1298. Upon Rudolph's early death in 1307 and the assassination of his father in 1308, he became the ruler of the Austrian and Styrian duchies on behalf of himself and his younger brothers. The royal title held by his father and grandfather however passed to Count Henry VII of Luxembourg, who was elected by six of seven votes, contrived by the mighty Archchancellor Peter von Aspelt, Elector and Prince- Archbishop of Mainz, a fierce opponent of late King Albert. Frederick had to abjure all claims to the German crown and in turn received the official affirmation of his fiefs by King Henry. Originally, he was a friend of his cousin Louis IV of Bavaria, who also had been raised at the Austrian court in Vienna. However, armed conflict arose between them when tutelage over the young sons of Louis' cousin, late Duke Stephen I of Lower Bavaria was entrusted to Frederick by local nobles in 1313. Frederick took the occasion to enlarge his reach of power, invaded the Bavarian lands, but was beaten by Louis at the Battle of Gammelsdorf on 9 November 1313, and had to renounce the tutelage. =Double election of 1314= Meanwhile, Henry VII had been crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Clement V on 29 June 1312, but he nevertheless died in the following year. As his son John the Blind, King of Bohemia since 1310, seemed too powerful to the prince-electors, Frederick again became a candidate for the crown, while King John withdrew and backed Louis IV of Wittelsbach. On 19 October 1314 at Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen, Frederick received four out of seven votes, however two of them being contested, by Archbishop Henry II of Cologne, by Louis' brother Elector Palatine Rudolph I of Wittelsbach who did not want to support his younger brother, by the deposed King Henry of Bohemia (the Luxemburgs had deposed him as King of Bohemia, the late Emperor Henry VII having confirmed the kingdom as fief to his own son whose wife was Elizabeth of Bohemia, and besides, the 1313 death of Henry's wife Anna, eldest surviving daughter of king Venceslas II of Bohemia, had taken from Henry all other legitimacy except the tenuous thought that once recognized as king by being consort of the heiress, the recognition suffices for the entire lifetime of the man) and Duke Rudolph I of Saxe-Wittenberg (whose right was contested by his Lauenburg cousin, head of the senior branch). The next day however (because the Luxemburg party did not accept this election), a second election was held upon the instigation of Archbishop Peter von Aspelt, where Louis IV of Wittelsbach was elected with the five votes by the Mainz archbishop himself, by Archbishop Baldwin of Trier, Margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg as well as by Duke John II of Saxe-Lauenburg (he contested his Wittenberg cousin's claim to the electoral vote) and - again - the King of Bohemia, John from the House of Luxemburg (his wife was Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia, next sister of the deceased queen Anna and at that time, the eldest then-surviving daughter of king Venceslas II). It is clear that at least three of the voters of Louis were uncontested electors. Frederick's capture at M√ºhldorf (19th century depiction) Louis made use of the conflict around the Bohemian throne and the rivalry over the Saxon electoral dignity between the Ascanian duchies of Saxe-Wittenberg and Saxe-Lauenburg. King Henry of Bohemia voting for Frederick actually only claimed the electoral power, as he had already been deposed in 1310 by late King Henry's son John the Blind voting for Louis. Duke John II of Saxe-Lauenburg in turn sought to prevail against his cousin Duke Rudolph I of Saxe-Wittenberg - which ultimately failed as the 1338 Declaration of Rhense and the Golden Bull of 1356 conclusively named the dukes of Saxe- Wittenberg as electors. Louis then was quickly crowned at Aachen Cathedral by Archbishop Peter von Aspelt, while Frederick was forced to proceed to Bonn Minster for his coronation on 25 November 1314 by the Cologne archbishop Heinrich von Virneburg. Both tried for the support by the Imperial States; Frederick was enfeebled by the fact that he had been crowned at the wrong place and moreover struggled with the rebellious Swiss Confederacy in the Swabian home territories of the Habsburgs, suffering a crushing defeat at the 1315 Battle of Morgarten. He nevertheless was able to hold his ground against the Wittelsbach rival and after several years of bloody war, victory finally seemed to be within Frederick's grasp, as he was strongly supported by the forces of his younger brother Leopold I. However, Frederick's army was in the end completely beaten near M√ºhldorf on Ampfing Heath on 28 September 1322, and Frederick and 1,300 nobles from Austria and the allied Archbishopric of Salzburg were captured. =Reconciliation= Louis held Frederick captive at Trausnitz Castle in the Upper Palatinate for three years, but the persistent resistance by Frederick's brother Leopold, the retreat of King John of Bohemia from his alliance and a ban by Pope John XXII induced Louis to release him under the Treaty of Trausnitz of 13 March 1325. In this agreement, Frederick finally recognized Louis as legitimate ruler and undertook to return to captivity if he did not succeed in convincing his younger brothers to submit to Louis. As he did not manage to overcome Leopold's obstinacy, Frederick returned to Munich as a prisoner, even though the Pope had released him from his oath. Impressed by Frederick's noble gesture, Louis renewed the old friendship with Frederick and they agreed to rule the Empire jointly. Since the Pope and the prince-electors strongly objected to this agreement, another treaty was signed at Ulm on 7 January 1326, according to which Frederick would govern Germany as King of the Romans, while Louis would be crowned Emperor by the \\"people of Rome\\" under Sciarra Colonna in 1328. After Leopold's death in 1326, Frederick actually withdrew from the regency of Germany and returned to rule only in Austria and Styria. He died on 13 January 1330, at Gutenstein Castle in the Wienerwald range, and was buried at Mauerbach Charterhouse, which he had founded. After the charterhouse was closed down in 1782, his remains were brought to the Ducal Crypt at St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna. Frederick's gracious return to captivity inspired Friedrich Schiller to write his poem Deutsche Treue (\\"German Loyalty\\") and Uhland to his tragedy Ludwig der Bayer (\\"Louis the Bavarian\\"). Marriage and issue On 11 May 1315 Frederick had married Isabella of Aragon, daughter of King James II of Aragon with Blanche of Anjou, an ambitious woman with an immense dowry. They had one son, who was born in 1316 but he died in 1322. Their daughters: * Elizabeth was born in 1317 and she died in 1336. * Anna was born in 1318, and married the Wittelsbach duke Henry XV of Bavaria in 1328. The marriage was childless. Henry died in 1333. Her second husband was Count John Henry IV of Gorizia. This marriage was also childless and John died in 1338. Anne died in 1343. Frederick was succeeded in Austria and Styria by his younger brothers Albert II and Otto. It took the Habsburgs more than a century to regain the royal crown, when Albert's II great-grandson Albert V of Austria ascended to the German throne in 1438.

Leeston is home to a variety of different sporting clubs and has a weekly running club each Wednesday evening. Sporting clubs in Leeston include: Rugby, Netball, Tennis, Lawn Bowls, Soccer, Cricket and Running. Leeston also has a fully equipped gym, which is open seven days a week from 4 a.m. to 11 p.m.  Schools  Its primary school was opened in 1865 and consolidated during the early 20th century. It was located on the west side of Leeston, with school residences being built in 1868. Its peak roll was 275, with classes in woodwork and metalwork for the males and cookery and sewing for the females being introduced in 1897. A side school for younger pupils was opened in Doyleston, and named Leeston Side School. Its peak roll was 131. There were many other schools in the Ellesmere area, including Doyleston School, Irwell School, Lakeside School, Brookside School, Killinchy School, and Little Rakaia School. These schools had very small rolls, and as early as 1898 there was a proposal that they should be closed and their pupils moved to the schools in the larger townships of Leeston and Southbridge. The Board replied that while the advantages that might accumulate from such a move were recognized, no funds were available for the purpose and no power existed to make attendance compulsory. The matter then was left alone for quarter of a century. In early 1923, the Chair of Education at Canterbury University College, Professor James Shelley, gave a public address in the Leeston Town Hall. He promoted the idea of closing a number of small schools and moving their pupils to Leeston Primary. The Ellesmere Guardian followed this up with an article supporting the idea. Some months later, at a meeting of the Leeston own Board, Dr. B. Volckman moved that Leeston was a suitable trying out ground for such consolidated. The clerk was instructed to send this resolution to the Canterbury Education Board after a unanimous vote of the members. For the next ten years the theoretical advantages and disadvantages of consolidation were discussed on and off. In December 1936, the party favourable to the consolidation gained a victory when a meeting of householders in Irwell voted in favour of consolidating Irwell School with Leeston. A week later, similar victories were achieved at Lakeside and Doyleston, with resolutions also being passed despite some opposition. Irwell and Doyleston pupils became foundation pupils of Leeston Consolidated School by April 1938. Lakeside opposition managed to hold out for slightly longer, but after a household meeting in August 1939, the motion carried in 1936 was confirmed, and in February 1940 the Lakeside pupils were conveyed to Leeston. In 1945 Brookside School also consolidated with Leeston after falling roll numbers made it apparent that the school would soon only be entitled to one teacher. Killinchy School remained open until 1959, when its pupils were then distributed between Leeston and Southbridge. Leeston Consolidated School is still in existence today, with approximately 200 families with children enrolled. It now has 7 Scale A teachers and 11 classrooms, as well as a library, a computer lab and a Reading Recovery room. Most children who attend the primary school then go on to attend Ellesmere College.

For many years he held a post in the custom house.

Kunitz and Howard Haycraft, New York, The H. W. Wilson Company, 1952. He died unmarried at his lodging in Nag's Head Court, Gracechurch Street, London, in 1737. His Grotto, a poem on Queen Caroline's grotto at Richmond was printed in 1732; and his chief poem, The Spleen, in 1737 with a preface by his friend Richard Glover. These and some other short poems were printed in Robert Dodsley's collection (1748), and subsequently in various editions of the British poets. They were edited in 1796 with a preface by John Aikin and in 1854 by Robert Aris Willmott with the poems of Thomas Gray and others. The Spleen, which was not originally intended for publication, is an epistle to Cuthbert Jackson, advocating cheerfulness, exercise and a quiet content as remedies. It is full of witty sayings. Thomas Gray said of it: \\"There is a profusion of wit everywhere; reading would have formed his judgment, and harmonized his verse, for even his wood-notes often break out into strains of real poetry and music\\". Despite this praise, Green is thought of as a \\"one-poem\\" poet, to the point that he became known as \\"Spleen-Green.\\" In an age of orthodoxy, Green had an original turn of mind.

David Reyne soon left and was replaced by Bill McDonough (drums, percussion). They were later joined by his brother Guy McDonough (vocals, rhythm guitar). The band was named after the front crawl swimming style also known as the Australian crawl. Australian Crawl were associated with surf music and sponsored a surfing competition in 1984. However, they also handled broader social issues such as shallow materialism, alcoholism, car accidents, and cautionary tales of romance. After their 1980 debut album, The Boys Light Up, reached No. 4, Australian Crawl had two No. 1 albums; 1981's Sirocco and 1982's Sons of Beaches. Their early singles reached the top 25 but none broke into the Top Ten; their best performing single was No. 1 hit \\"Reckless\\" which showed a more mature approach than earlier hits, and came from their 1983 Semantics EP. Upheaval within the band occurred from 1983 onwards. First Bill McDonough left, then his brother Guy McDonough died in 1984, then various other members left. Their 1985 release Between a Rock and a Hard Place was expensive but sales were disappointing and they disbanded early in 1986. The band's status as an icon on the Australian music scene was acknowledged by induction into the 1996 Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame. Founding guitarist Brad Robinson was unable to attend the Hall of Fame induction in person, as he was hospitalised with lymphoma and died two weeks later. Biography =1975‚Äì1979: formation and \\"Beautiful People\\"= The band Spiff Rouch formed in 1976 in the Mornington Peninsula suburb of Mount Eliza on the outskirts of Melbourne. The group lineup featured James Reyne, brothers Bill and Guy McDonough, Paul Williams, Robert Walker and Simon Binks. Reyne had previously played drums for Archie Slammit and the Doors. By early 1978 Spiff Rouch had separated into two groups: The Flatheads (including the McDonough brothers and Walker, along with Sean Higgins and Nigel Spencer) and Australian Crawl. The original lineup for the latter was Reyne as vocalist, Binks on lead guitar, Williams on bass guitar, along with Reyne's younger brother David Reyne on drums and schoolmate Brad Robinson on rhythm guitar. Australian Crawl performed their first live gig in October 1978 and toured the pub circuit. David Reyne left the group in 1979 to finish his acting course, later becoming an actor and TV presenter as well as drumming for Cats Under Pressure and the Chantoozies (1986‚Äì1990). He was replaced in Australian Crawl by Bill McDonough. The group's popularity in the Mornington Peninsula area increased with further pub gigs, then they gained audiences with university students and inner city residents. Once the band's escalating popularity brought them into Melbourne they caught the attention of Little River Band's guitarist David Briggs, who helped them gain a recording contract with EMI and he produced their first single. \\"Beautiful People\\" (1979) reached No. 22 on the National charts. Reyne had co-written the song with guitarist Mark Hudson in 1975. The track included references to the shallow materialism of residents of Toorak and to the Bombay Rock night club in Brunswick. Just days before recording \\"Beautiful People\\" Reyne had been hit by a car in Swanston Street, Melbourne, breaking bones in both wrists, an episode later chronicled in the track \\"Indisposed\\". Australian Crawl made one of the most memorable debuts on Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) TV series Countdown performing \\"Beautiful People\\" as Reyne still had both arms encased in plaster. \\"Beautiful People\\" remains one of their most popular songs according to listeners of Triple M in 2007. =1980 The Boys Light Up= Australian Crawl's debut album, The Boys Light Up (1980), also produced by Briggs for EMI, had a number of hit singles with songwriting shared around the group and beyond. Tracks from this album included the previously released single \\"Beautiful People\\", the title track (written by Reyne and Mark Hudson); \\"Indisposed\\" (Brad Robinson, James Robinson, Reyne, Bill McDonough) and \\"Downhearted\\" (Sean Higgins, Guy McDonough, Bill McDonough) (from The Flatheads). Brad Robinson's father James Robinson was a Federal Arbitration Court Justice. \\"The Boys Light Up\\", their second single, was almost banned from radio play due to its explicit lyrics. Many listeners believed the chorus lyrics were about smoking marijuana but Reyne has stated that it was about smoking tobacco cigarettes at school. It also reached No. 22 on the National charts and became their signature song and their most popular track especially live. Their third single \\"Downhearted\\" charted higher at #12 and was a cautionary tale of romance gone wrong. The Boys Light Up reached No. 4 on the Australian album charts and remained in the charts for an unbroken 101 weeks. It sold five times platinum: over 280,000 copies, and became one of the biggest Australian albums of the 1980s. Singer/guitarist/songwriter Guy McDonough (ex-The Flatheads and Bill's younger brother) joined the group in October 1980. Rock journalist and commentator Glenn A. Baker compared Australian Crawl with various fellow Australian bands: However, according to James Reyne some people accused them of being demonic.Wilmoth, Peter ‚Äì Glad All Over ‚Äì The Countdown Years 1974‚Äì1987, pp: 151‚Äì2 McPhee Gribble/Penguin Books 1993.

Named for Errol Flynn's yacht, the album peaked at No. 1 on the Australian album chart on 3 August and remained there for six weeks. At about this time Robinson was married to actress Kerry Armstrong, later an Australian Film Institute Award winner, who co-wrote a track \\"Easy on Your Own\\" for the album. Sirocco spawned the hit singles \\"Things Don't Seem\\" (May, No. 11 National charts) and \\"Errol\\" (August, #18). It also included \\"Oh No Not You Again\\" (November).Who's Who of Australia Rock Chris Spencer, Zbig Nowara, Phil McHenry Of these, \\"Errol\\" about womanising Tasmanian-born actor Flynn is the band's third most popular song of all. Another track from the album, \\"Lakeside\\", became a popular radio inclusion. 1981 Australian End of Year Album Charts has Sirocco at No. 2 behind Double Fantasy by John Lennon and ahead of AC/DC's Back in Black making it the best charting album by an Australian act. Another track on this album, Unpublished Critics has been compared several times to the later song \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\" by US band Guns N' Roses as acknowledged, by its writer, James Reyne. He was responding to media comments in May 2015 about the possibility of plagiarism by the American band. On the wave of this popularity the band toured extensively playing to huge crowds at Melbourne's Myer Music Bowl (10,000), Sydney's Domain (90,000), the Narara Rock festival (70,000), smashing attendance records at indoor venues in Brisbane and Perth. They were voted Countdown 1981 Most Popular Group, and James Reyne was voted 1980 and 1981 Most Popular Male Performer. Sons of Beaches (1982) was recorded in Hawaii with expatriate Australian Mike Chapman producing. The album had a rougher, rock 'n' roll edge than its glossy pop rock predecessors and featured the No. 17 hit \\"Shut Down\\" (June). It also included a re-recorded version of \\"Downhearted\\" and became their second album to reach No. 1 on the Australian albums chart and remained there for five weeks. EMI issued the album in the USA. Two further singles, \\"Daughters of the Northern Coast\\" (August) and \\"Runaway Girls\\" (November) failed to reach the Australian Top 40. Over 1982 and 1983, Reyne was filmed with Australian actresses Rebecca Gilling and Wendy Hughes in the television miniseries Return to Eden, which was screened in September 1983. For Reyne's role of playboy tennis professional Greg Marsden, he was given the 1984 \\"Most Popular New Talent Award\\" at the TV Week Logie Awards. Reyne later declared he was not very good in the part, declining many acting offers since. During breaks in filming, the singer accepted an offer from Paul Christie (Mondo Rock) and Kevin Borich to join their part-time band The Party Boys with Harvey James from Sherbet and Graham Bidstrup from The Angels. The group played a short run of shows around Sydney venues and played covers exclusively. The resultant album, Live at Several 21sts, peaked at No. 9 on the national chart. =1983‚Äì1984: \\"Reckless\\", Semantics and Phalanx= Soon after Reyne finished acting for Return to Eden, Bill McDonough left due to tensions within the band. The remaining members then recorded the EP Semantics (1983) with Bidstrup (from The Party Boys, later a founder of GANGgajang) on drums. The four track EP contained their best-known song, \\"Reckless\\" (aka \\"Don't Be So Reckless\\", \\"She Don't Like That\\") which was written by Reyne, and went to No. 1 on the Australian singles chart on 28 November. John Watson (Kevin Borich Express) then came in as a permanent replacement for McDonough. The live album Phalanx was something of a stop-gap measure between studio albums, nevertheless it reached No. 4 during December. The band's biggest overseas break came when Duran Duran took the band as support on certain legs of their \\"Sing Blue Silver\\" tour of the UK. US label Geffen Records signed Australian Crawl and issued Semantics (1984) as an album (with the four songs from the EP and re-recordings of tracks from past Australian records) for the American market. In April 1984 Australian Crawl became the first Australian band to sponsor an ASP surfing competition. The Rip Curl/Australian Crawl Bell's Beach Surfing Festival was won by Australian surfer, Cheyne Horan. In June 1984 the band was forced off the road when Guy McDonough was admitted to hospital in Melbourne; he died soon after of viral pneumonia. Australian Crawl regrouped with Mark Greig on guitar (ex-Runners) for a series of live performances in late 1984. Prior to Guy's death, he had recorded demos with his brother Bill McDonough (drums, percussion), Sean Higgins (synthesisers) and Nigel Spencer (bass, synthesisers), (all former The Flatheads); and Mick Hauser (saxophone) and Michael Bright (guitar). Bill McDonough assembled the tapes and produced Guy McDonough's posthumous album My Place on Wheatley Records in April 1985. Singles \\"My Place\\" / \\"Things Don't Seem\\" and \\"What's in it For Me\\" / \\"Hook, Line and Sinker\\" were also released. \\"Things Don't Seem\\" written by Guy McDonough and Sean Higgins, had been released as an Australian Crawl single in 1981 off Sirocco. Tracks from these sessions were re-mastered and released on Lost & Found in 1996. =1985‚Äì1986: Between a Rock and a Hard Place, The Final Wave and split= By 1985 the group recorded their last studio album, Between a Rock and a Hard Place, with English producer Adam Kidron. It was released in Australia on Australian Crawl's own label Freestyle Records. The album, which allegedly cost $400,000 to record, was a mishmash of styles and a commercial disaster (it peaked at No. 12 in August 1985 but slipped out of the Top 40 two weeks later). None of the singles had any Top 40 chart success. Harry Brus (Kevin Borich Express) replaced long-standing bass player Paul Williams in May 1985. The band performed three songs for the July 1985 Oz for Africa concert‚Äîpart of the global Live Aid program‚Äî\\"Reckless (Don't Be So)\\", \\"Two Can Play\\" and \\"The Boys Light Up\\". It was broadcast in Australia (on both Seven Network and Nine Network) and on MTV in the US. When the album virtually failed to chart, the band was ready to split but had to go out on tour to pay off its debts. On 27 January 1986, their final Melbourne concert was recorded and released as the live album The Final Wave in October. The band performed its final concert on 1 February at the Perth Entertainment Centre. In seven years, Australian Crawl had sold over a million records in Australia, with five of its albums and an EP reaching the Australian Top 5 Album Charts, two of which had been No. 1 hits. A cumulative total of eleven weeks at Number 1 on the Albums Charts places them equal fourth for Australian groups behind Skyhooks, The Seekers and Midnight Oil. =1986‚Äì1995: Solo careers= In 1985, Lin Buckfield (Electric Pandas) and Reyne released a duet single \\"R.O.C.K.\\" / \\"Under My Thumb\\". After Australian Crawl disbanded, Reyne went on to a solo career. His first few singles failed to chart but 1987's \\"Fall of Rome\\" and the self-titled album that followed were the beginning of a string of hits that lasted until the early 1990s. In 1992 he and James Blundell had a hit with a cover of The Dingoes' \\"Way Out West\\" (#2, May 1992). Reyne also formed Company of Strangers that year with former Sherbet lead singer Daryl Braithwaite, Simon Hussey and Jef Scott. Company of Strangers only released one self-titled album, Company of Strangers in 1992, which produced the hits \\"Motor City (I Get Lost)\\" (#26, September 1992), \\"Sweet Love\\" (#21, January 1993) and \\"Daddy's Gonna Make You a Star\\" (#35, March 1993). In 1993 Reyne appeared as Tina Turner's manager Roger Davies in What's Love Got to do With It?. He featured in twelve episodes of State Coroner during 1998 and in 2003's The Postcard Bandit. Reyne lives on the Mornington Peninsula with his partner, Tina, and a daughter. He has released his eighth solo studio album, Every Man a King (2007) and still performs occasionally. Almost immediately after the split Robinson became manager of Chantoozies (with early Crawl drummer David Reyne). Their first single, \\"The Witch Queen of New Orleans\\" (1986), a cover of Redbone's song, reached No. 4 on the National charts. Robinson then moved into a career in television (with Network Ten's Page One) and as a co-producer of documentaries. In the 1990s he became the manager for the Reyne brothers and worked as an agent for the Advantage Sports Management Group. This included managing Australian tennis player Mark Philippoussis. Three years after being diagnosed with lymphoma, Robinson died on 13 October 1996. Binks played in the Broderick Smith Band in 1988. He was injured in a 1995 car crash at a council roadworks that left him slightly brain-damaged. A court in 2006 awarded him $330,253 in damages, down from an estimated $750,000 because he was said to be over the legal limit. Binks later disputed the alcohol reading as belonging to another driver and stated the remuneration mostly went to his lawyers. A 2007 appeal by the council, saw amount awarded further reduced to $304,750. Williams who had left the band in 1985, was working in music-related retail. =1996‚Äìpresent: ARIA Hall of Fame and compilations= In 1996, a compilation titled Lost & Found was released. It contained seven of the tracks from Guy McDonough's solo album My Place which were remastered. Compilers and producers of Lost & Found were Bill McDonough and Peter Blyton. Lost & Found tracks from My Place include \\"Too Many People\\" a duet sung by Guy McDonough with Colin Hay of Men at Work. Some My Place tracks used on Lost & Found have Reyne singing backing vocals. As of 2001, Bill McDonough left the music industry and began working in the construction industry and continues to own and operate his building and demolition companies in 2017. The band was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in September 1996. Three weeks later, Robinson died. Additional compilation albums were released; More Wharf in 1998, Reckless: 1979‚Äì1995 in 2000 and The Definitive Collection in 2002. The Definitive Collection contained songs from the band and from James Reyne's solo career. In 2001, as part of its 75th Anniversary celebrations, the Australian Performing Right Association (APRA) compiled a list of the Top 30 Australian songs, with \\"Reckless (Don't Be So)\\" coming in at number nineteen. In October 2007, eleven Australian Crawl tracks were featured in the Triple M Essential 2007 Countdown of songs (positions are voted by listeners out of the best 2007 songs of all time). They were \\"Hoochie Gucci Fioruci Mama\\" #1673; \\"Lakeside\\" #1354; \\"Indisposed\\" #956; \\"Downhearted\\" #728; \\"Oh No Not You Again\\" #587; \\"Shut Down\\" #415; \\"Things Don't Seem\\" #371; \\"Boys Light Up\\" #305; \\"Errol\\" #227; \\"Beautiful People\\" #153; and \\"Reckless\\" #39. In January 2014, Universal Music Australia celebrated the 35th anniversary of the release of \\"Beautiful People\\" by releasing The Greatest Hits, which peaked at number 4 and was the 40th best selling album in Australian in 2014. In October 2016, Australian Crawl released a seven album vinyl collection, titled The Album Collection. The collection included the band's four studio albums, two live albums and the US-expanded version of the Semantics album which had previously been unavailable to Australian audiences.

We are informed by the narrator that the novel is about \\"goodness\\". Plot summary Nana, an attractive young \\"non-talker\\" in her mid-twenties--\\"tall, thin, pale, blonde, breasty\\"--who is working on her M.A. thesis, lives with her \\"Papa\\", the \\"benevolent angel\\" of the story, in Edgware, a suburb of London. She gets to know Moshe, a young Jewish actor from Finsbury, and they start a relationship. As time goes by, Anjali, a friend of Moshe's, joins them more and more in their sparetime activities until Nana, for whom sex is not necessarily a top priority, suggests a \\"threesome\\" because she wants Moshe to be happy. Accordingly, due to Nana's altruism, for some months Nana and Moshe are joined in their lovemaking by Anjali, who is bisexual. The narrator, who defines a threesome as \\"the socialist utopia of sex\\", describes not only the sociology, psychology and ethics of their m√©nage √† trois (for example by comparing it to the love triangle depicted in the film Cabaret) but also, in some detail, the technicalities and what he calls \\"sexual etiquette\\". However, he also frequently ponders philosophical questions and occasionally redefines old concepts such as that of infidelity (\\"the selfish desire to be helpful to more than one person\\"). In the summer Nana goes on holiday with her Papa, leaving behind two thirds of the m√©nage √† trois. In Venice, Italy, Papa complains of a splitting headache, and shortly after their return to England he suffers a stroke--a good excuse for Nana to break up with both Moshe and Anjali, although her father is saddened by the thought of his daughter giving up her boyfriend on his account. Characters *Nana - protagonist *Papa - Nana's father *Moshe - a Jewish actor *Anjali - a bisexual Allusions/references to actual history, geography and current science The ramblings of the narrator and Nana's interest in architecture lead to an impressive list of famous people being mentioned in the pages of Politics. Some are just briefly referred to, others are presented by means of an anecdote proving a point the narrator is trying to make. They include, in alphabetical order, Guillaume Apollinaire, Nikolai Bukharin, Mikhail Bulgakov, Antonio Gramsci, V√°clav Havel, Rem Koolhaas, Milan Kundera, Osip Mandelstam, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Issey Miyake, J√≥zef Rotblat, Jonathan Sacks, Elsa Schiaparelli, Oscar Wilde, and Mao Zedong. When rendering spoken language (see Estuary English), Thirlwell time and again uses pronunciation respelling. Accordingly, he has the protagonists say things like akshully, arkitetcha, fra bit, frages (= for ages), I dint say, I spose, internaschnal, keemo (= chemo[therapy]), Le mgo, Not tonigh, refyoose, restron, snot (= it is not), and therpy.

It had a very long and slender body, usually one to two metres in length (some were reported to have been at least six feet in length) that tapered toward the end into a slightly flared bell. It is commonly seen in paintings being played by angels and often also bearing the banner of a nobleman. The term descends from Buccina, a Roman military horn. The term is first found in the c1100 Chanson de Roland, and it was probably a general term for horns and trumpets rather than referring to a specific instrument. Early trumpets were slightly curved, but the term was applied c1300 to straight trumpets imported from the Middle East during the Crusades.

It is one of the New Zealand Great Walks. Hikers often take three days to walk it, but it can be done in one or two days. One end is at Lee Bay, 5 km north of Oban (Stewart Island's only settlement), and the other end is at Fern Gully, 2 km west of Oban. It can be walked either way, but is most often walked anticlockwise, starting at Lee Bay. Hikers can arrange transport from Oban over the roads to and from the ends of the track, or can walk along the roads. The track generally follows the coastline for a large part of its length, passing small inlets, large bays and mudflats, and crosses steep hills covered in bush (dense forest) in its middle section. Large sections of the track have been gravelled. Without this, much of the track would degrade into mud, due to the peaty soil, and the rain that falls frequently throughout the year. In general, the track is well-maintained, and of easy to medium difficulty. Walking the track offers the unusual opportunity to see kiwi in the wild. The species on Stewart Island is the southern brown kiwi (Apteryx australis). There are two huts on the track, at Port William and the North Arm of Paterson Inlet, and many hikers sleep overnight at each. There are also campsites at Maori Beach, Port William and North Arm. The huts and campsites have toilets and water supply, and the huts have bunks and mattresses. Toilet paper is not provided and hikers must bring their own. There are no cooking facilities, so trampers are advised to carry their own stoves and cooking equipment. Gas canisters and other supplies can be purchased at a store in Oban before setting out. The huts are supplied with firewood, which is flown in by helicopter, as there are no roads to the huts, and trampers are not allowed to cut firewood. The huts and campsites must be booked in advance. Rakiura Track has been covered by Google Street View since November 2015.

It is located at the centre of a rich sheep and dairy farming region, for which it is a service town. It lies on the north bank of the Temuka River, just above its confluence with the Opihi River. Demographics With a population of 4,047 people in 2013, it is the second largest town in South Canterbury after Timaru. Temuka is home to three schools, two primary schools and one secondary school. Temuka is accessed by New Zealand's State Highway Number 1 and the Main South Line railway allowing for major cargo handling. Temuka is north of the Opihi and Temuka rivers. The local secondary school, Opihi College, takes its name from the Opihi River. Both rivers are popular with locals and tourists. Almost all traffic passing north or south goes through or around Temuka. Temuka has recently had the redevelopment of the local Domain by incorporating a skate park to join the other facilities which include a swimming pool, mini golf, golf, netball, outdoor bowls and tennis. There are also rugby and football fields, a stadium complex and a holiday park. History and culture alt= The name Te umu kaha (original spelling) means long-lasting ovens, from the earth ovens that MƒÅori used to cook the plentifully-growing cabbage trees. Temuka was a stop on the Main South Line until passenger services were discontinued. At one time Temuka supported wool scouring plants, it had a flour mill and manufactured electric power transmission insulators. Temuka previously had its own council system in place, but has been under the administration of Timaru District Council since 1989. Recently, the council has been redeveloping Temuka in the form of cleaning waterways, new walkways, redeveloping of existing walkways, new gardens, domains, new tennis courts, complete skate park and general modernisation of the large service town. =Marae= Arowhenua marae, a marae (tribal meeting ground) of NgƒÅi Tahu and its Te R≈´nanga o Arowhenua branch, is located south of Temuka.

It was designed by aerospace engineer Burt Rutan for the Rutan Aircraft Factory. Rutan Defiant N57KS. An updated Defiant instrument panel with Dynon Avionics Skyview Efis Defiant Taxi Development The prototype Defiant, N78RA, was first flown on 30 June 1978. It had been intended as a proof-of-concept of a very safe light twin design, requiring little trim change and no pilot action in case of engine failure, and with good single engine performance. A comparison of the Defiant single engine climb rate with a Gulfstream Cougar had shown about vs per minute at low altitude with both aircraft cleaned up. The prototype is now owned by the Hiller Aviation Museum. In 1979 the Rutan Aircraft Factory announced they would proceed with certification of a Defiant-based light twin. Adequate financing was not secured for this project, and the design was modified for homebuilt construction as the Model 74, with the second aircraft (built by Fred Keller) appearing at Oshkosh 1983. Plans were offered in mid-1984. 176 sets of plans were purchased before RAF discontinued selling plans in 1985. Nine examples were known to be flying as of mid-1987. Nineteen are registered with the FAA as of 2005. Design The Defiant is built using fiberglass layup over Styrofoam core shapes in the same manner as the Rutan VariEze. The main gear is fixed, and there are no flaps. The Propellers are fixed-pitch non-feathering, which is unusual in a twin-engine design. Cockpit entry is through a side hinged canopy. The winglets provide yaw stability. Unusually, the Defiant has a ventral, port offset, forward mounted rudder, as can be seen in pictures of the plane taxiing.

Lake Tekapo (often known simply as Tekapo to avoid confusion with the lake itself) is a small town (township) located at the southern end of the lake of the same name in the inland South Island of New Zealand. It had 369 residents according to the 2013 census, being one of five settlements in the sparsely populated Mackenzie Basin. SH 8 runs directly through the township ‚Äì 227 km from Christchurch and 256 km from Queenstown. Daily shuttle services link Lake Tekapo to Christchurch and Queenstown. The lake is a popular tourist destination, and several resort hotels are located at the township. Lake Tekapo Airport is located 5 km west of the town. Chartered flights are available at locally based Air Safaris. Twizel lies 60km (39 minutes drive) south of Lake Tekapo via Lake Pukaki and Burkes Pass lies 21km (15 minutes drive) west along state highway 8. History The MƒÅori were the first people to discover the Mackenzie Basin. The name Tekapo derives from the te reo MƒÅori words taka (sleeping mat) and po (night). The Mackenzie Basin became known to Europeans in 1855 when, in order to find a less conspicuous route, James Mackenzie, a Scottish sheep thief, ventured inland and discovered the high country that now bears his name. In 1857, John and Barbara Hay established the first sheep farm in Mackenzie on the shore of Lake Tekapo. Church of the Good Shepherd, Taken from the YHA at Lake Tekapo Township Lake Tekapo township started to grow after the construction of hydropower stations in the 1930s. The project was delayed due to World War II, but it was eventually completed and commissioned in 1951. The Church of the Good Shepherd was built in 1935. Now, it opens to the public from 9am to 5pm during summer (Oct to Apr) and 10am to 4pm in winter (May to Sept). Dog Statue, which is dedicated to the working collies of Mackenzie, was commissioned on 7 March 1968. Tekapo is expected to grow significantly over the next 30 years. The MacKenzie District Council expects the district‚Äôs population will jump from 4950 to 9050, dwellings 3872 to 6120, jobs 1876 to 4618, and peak day visitors 17,378 to 61,253. Climate Lake Tekapo has an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Cfb) with mild, sunny summers and cool winters, sometimes snowing in the township once or twice a year. On average, Lake Tekapo has 2180 sunshine hours (200 hours more than the New Zealand average) and 78 rain days producing 600 mm rainfall annually. Temperature is generally warm in summer and extremely cold in winter, by New Zealand standards.  Demographics  The Tekapo settlement had a usual resident population of 558 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 195 people (53.7%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 240 people (75.5%) since the 2006 census. There were 273 males and 285 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.96 males per female. Of the total population, 57 people (10.2%) were aged up to 15 years, 180 (32.3%) were 15 to 29, 270 (48.4%) were 30 to 64, and 51 (9.1%) were 65 or older. In terms of ethnicity, 60.2% were European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 3.8% were MƒÅori, 1.1% were Pacific peoples, 32.3% were Asian, and 8.1% were other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities).  Attractions  =Mount John University Observatory= Lake Tekapo township as seen from the nearby Mount John University Observatory Selected for its very clear atmosphere, large number of clear sky nights, and relative freedom from light pollution, Mount John University Observatory is located on a small hill to the north of the town, and south of the small Lake Alexandrina. Originally set up by the University of Pennsylvania (looking for a southern hemisphere location), it is now operated by the University of Canterbury. From 1969 to 1982, the United States Air Force had a satellite tracking station adjacent to the observatory. In June 2012, an area of around Tekapo was declared the Aoraki Mackenzie International Dark Sky Reserve by the International Dark-Sky Association, one of only four such reserves around the world. = Tekapo Hot Springs = Tekapo Hot Springs is a major tourist attraction. It has three hot pools designed for soaking in, which range in temperature from 36.5 to 38.5 degrees Celsius. These are designed in the shape of Lake Ohau, Lake Pukaki and Lake Tekapo. A further two cooler pools are designed for children and a splash pad is also present. Tekapo Hot Springs also has an ice skating rink and a snow tubing park. = Skiing = Roundhill Ski Area is located on the Two Thumb Range overlooking Lake Tekapo. It is approximately 32 kilometers from Lake Tekapo Village. Roundhill's base is at 1350 meters above sea level and the highest poin the lifts rise to is 2133 meters above sea level. It comprises 550 hectares of terrain. Military base The New Zealand Army has a large training range located at Tekapo. It is used for general military exercises and for pre-deployment training of forces being sent to Afghanistan.  Government  Tekapo is part of the Waitaki electorate.

The Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas is a Grade II Listed building in Toxteth, Liverpool, situated at the junction of Berkley Street and Princes Road. Built in the Neo-Byzantine architecture style, it was completed in 1870. The architects were W. & J. Hay and the church was built by Henry Sumners. It is an enlarged version of St Theodore's church in Constantinople (now converted into the Vefa Kilise Mosque). St. Nicholas' was built in the Liverpool neighbourhood of Toxteth in a period when Liverpool's magnates were filling Toxteth with opulent mansions. The church stands in a neighbourhood of substantial homes and in a cluster of houses of worship designed to advertise the wealth and status of a group of captains of industry that was remarkably ethnically diverse, by the standards of Victorian England. Immediately adjacent to St. Nicholas are the Princes Road Synagogue and an early French gothic, Welsh Presbyterian Church. The exterior is extremely ornate, featuring arches within arches, done in alternating bands of white stone and red brick. There is a row of three domes on the portico, and a fourth dome over the nave, all raised on drums.

Fundamentally a development of the robust and successful Yak-7B fighter based in turn on a tandem-seat advanced trainer Yak-7UTI, the Yak-9 started arriving in Soviet fighter aviation regiments in late 1942 and played a major role in taking air superiority over Luftwaffe aces on the new Focke-Wulf Fw 190 and Messerschmitt Bf 109G fighters during the grand Battle of Kursk in summer 1943. The Yak-9 had a lowered rear fuselage decking and all-around vision canopy. Its lighter metal longerons gave the new fighter a potential to increase fuel load and armament that previous models with wooden airframe had lacked.Gustin 2003, p. 120. The maneuverable, high-speed at low/medium altitudes and easy to control Yak-9 was one of the best and the most mass- produced Soviet fighter of World War II. It was produced in different variants including the Yak-9T with the and the \\"large-calibre\\" Yak-9K with the cannon firing through propeller hub to be effectively used against enemy tanks and aircraft, the fighter-bomber Yak-9B with the inner bomb bay behind cockpit of up to bombs, the long-range Yak-9D and the Yak-9DD with additional wing fuel tanks to escort Allied bombers over Eastern Europe, the Yak-9U with the more powerful engine and improved aerodynamics. The Yak-9 remained in production from 1942 to 1948, with 16,769 built (14,579 during the war).Drabkin 2007, p. 146.. Following World War II, the Yak-9 was used also by the North Korean Air Force during the Korean War.Angelucci and Matricardi 1978, p. 246. Design and development The Yak-9 represented further development of the successful Yakovlev Yak-7 fighter, a production version of the lightened Yak-7DI, taking full advantage of the combat experience with its predecessor. Greater availability of duralumin allowed for lighter construction which in turn permitted a number of modifications to the basic design. Yak-9 variants carried two different wings, five different engines, six different fuel tank combinations and seven types of armament configurations. = Yak-9U = During December 1943, the creation of a new airframe (Yak-9U) allowed the installation of the M-107A engine, which was more powerful than the previous VK-105PF. The engine mount was brand new and included individual faired exhaust pipes, wings, and fuselage structure that was made of metal while the whole aircraft received a covering of Bakelite skin. The horizontal tail surfaces were slightly reduced in order to afford the aircraft improved pitch control. The oil cooler intake was moved from beneath the nose to the port wing root as well as an enlarged radiator bath being moved further aft under the fuselage. A supercharger intake was centered on the top decking of the engine cowling. The rear antenna cable was moved inside a lengthened rear canopy which featured a more aerodynamically refined shape with a modified fuselage deck contour. The typical armament of the Yak-9U was a ShVAK cannon with 120 rounds that was fired through the aircraft's hollow propeller shaft, and two Berenzin UB machine guns with 340 rounds. January to April 1944 marked the commencement of State trials and revealed that the Yak-9U had a superior top-speed compared to all fighters in service on the Eastern front at . Unlike the I-185 the Yak-9U was a much simpler to fly and stable aircraft. Ultimately the M-107A engine inherited all the problems of the VK-105PF engine. The engine was prone to overheating, oil leaks, loss of engine pressure during climbs, spark plugs constantly burning out, and intense vibrations which would fatigue assembly bolts leading to a short engine life. These defects forced the first production batches starting during April 1944 to be powered by the reliable M-105 PF-3 engine. Further changes would include the fuel capacity of the Yak-9U being upgraded to and in order to re-balance the aircraft, the wings were moved forward and the aircraft's Vlsh-107LO propeller being replaced with the older VISH-105S. A total production of 1,134 aircraft were constructed by December 1944. Operational history =Second World War= The first Yak-9 entered service in October 1942 and first saw combat in late 1942. The versatile Yak-9 operated with a wide variety of armament for use in anti-tank, light bomber and long-range escort roles. At low altitude, in which it operated predominantly, the Yak-9 was more maneuverable than its main foe, the Bf 109, but was far less well armed. A series of improvements in performance and armament did not hamper the superb handling characteristics that allowed its pilots to excel at dog-fighting. Soviet pilots regarded the Yak-9's performance as on the same level as the Bf 109G and Fw 190A-3/A-4.Morgan 1999, p. 52. After the Battle of Smolensk, in the second half of 1943, the famed Free French Normandie-Ni√©men unit became a Groupe and was equipped with the Yak-9.Morgan 1999, p. 24. The first unit to use the Yak-9U, between 25 October and 25 December 1944, was 163.IAP. Pilots were ordered not to use the engine at combat speed since this reduced its life to two or three flights only. Nevertheless, in the course of 398 sorties, the unit claimed 27 Focke-Wulf Fw 190As and one Bf 109G-2, for the loss of two Yaks in dogfights, one to flak and four in accidents. The Yak-9U contributed greatly to Soviet air superiority, and the Germans avoided the Yaks ‚Äúwithout antenna mast‚Äù.Leonard 2005, p. 125. A large formation of the Yak-9DD version was transferred to Bari (the capital of Apulia, in Italy) to help Yugoslav partisans in the Balkans.Gunston 1984, p. 256. One of the top-scoring Yak-9 pilots was First Lieutenant A.I. Vybornov. Flying a type-T (equipped with a 37mm NS-37 cannon in the nose) he achieved 19 air victories, plus nine shared. He was awarded the Gold Star Medal of the Hero of the Soviet Union in June 1945.Morgan 1999, p. 33. At the end of the war, on 22 March 1945, Lieutenant L.I. Sivko from 812th IAP achieved the air victory against a Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, but he was killed soon afterward by another Me 262, probably piloted by Franz Schall, a top-scoring Me 262 pilot.Morgan 1999, p. 53. Fighter units with this aircraft suffered lower losses than average. Of 2,550 Yak-9s manufactured up the end of 1943, only 383 were lost in combat. Bergstrom 2008, p. 32. =Post-war era= During 1949, the Soviet Union provided surplus Yak-9P (VK-107) aircraft to some satellite states in the Soviet bloc in order to help them rebuild their air forces in the wake of the West Berlin blockade. A section of the aircraft's operating manual was accidentally omitted from the translation from Russian into some languages: before starting the Yak-9, it was necessary to hand-crank a small cockpit- mounted oil pump 25 times to provide initial lubrication to the Klimov V12 engine, unlike World War II German and Western fighters equipped with forced closed-cycle lubrication systems. Skipping this unusual but vital step resulted in frequent engine seizures during the takeoff roll and initial climb, causing several fatalities during 1950. Variants Modern reproduction Yak-9 on takeoff at a World War II Air Show in Reading, Pennsylvania in 2002 Yak-9 with Polish markings Yakovlev OKB created 22 modifications of the Yak-9, of which 15 saw mass production. The most notable of these include: ;Yak-9 First production version, Klimov M-105PF engine with , 1 √ó ShVAK cannon with 120 rounds and 1 √ó UBS machine gun with 200 rounds. ;Yak-9 (M-106) Prototype with Klimov M-106-1SK engine with , did not advance to production because of problems with the engine. ;Yak-9T Yak-9 armed with a Nudelman-Suranov NS-37 cannon with 30 rounds instead of the ShVAK, cockpit moved back to compensate for the heavier nose. Initially poor quality control led to multiple oil and coolant leaks from cannon recoil.(It was a problem only during the prototype tests:Yakovlev‚Äôs Piston-Engined Fighters (Red Star ‚Ññ5) by Yefim Gordon and Dmitriy Khazanov page 65. )Recoil and limited supply of ammunition required accurate aiming and two-three round bursts. Yak-9T was widely used against enemy shipping on the Black Sea and against tanks (the cannon could penetrate up to armor from , but was also successful against aircraft with a single cannon hit usually sufficient to tear apart the target. Virage (constant altitude and velocity turn) time: 18‚Äì19 seconds. 2748 were produced. Yak-9T silhouette compared to an early variant ;Yak-9K Yak-9T modified with a 45 mm NS-45 cannon with 29 rounds and a distinctive muzzle brake to deal with the massive recoil. Firing the cannon at speeds below caused dramatic loss of control and tossed the pilot back and forth in the cockpit; however, accurate shooting was possible at higher speeds and in 2‚Äì3 round bursts. The recoil also caused numerous oil and coolant leaks. The heavy cannon installation degraded performance, even more so at high altitudes, sufficiently to relegating the Yak-9K to be used as a heavy fighter and resulting in the need for a fighter escort of Yak-3s. The Yak-9K saw only limited use due to unreliability of the NS-45, airframe performance issues caused by both the NS-45 and larger fuel tanks used on the Yak-9K, as well as a reduction of bombers used by the Germans. Yak-9 Racer ;Yak-9D Long-range version of Yak-9, fuel capacity increased from to giving a maximum range of . Combat usefulness at full range was limited by lack of radio navigation equipment, and a number of aircraft were used as short-range fighters with fuel carried only in inner wing tanks. Circle time: 19‚Äì20 sec. Weight of fire: . ;Yak-9TD Yak-9D with NS-37 cannon and provision for 4 √ó FAB-50 bombs under the wings. ;Yak-9B Fighter-bomber version of Yak-9D (factory designation Yak-9L) with four vertical tube bomb bays aft of the cockpit with capacity for up to 4 √ó FAB-100 bombs or 4 PTAB cassettes with 32 √ó bomblets each, although normally only of weapons were carried in the front bomb bays. Poor handling with a full bomb and fuel load and lack of special aiming equipment limited combat usefulness. ;Yak-9DD Yak-9D and Yak-9T modified to further increase the range, fuel capacity increased to giving a maximum range of , radio navigation equipment for night and poor weather flying. Yak-9DD were used primarily to escort Petlyakov Pe-2 and Tupolev Tu-2 bombers although they proved less than ideal for this role due to insufficient speed advantage over the bombers. In 1944, several Yak-9DD were used to escort B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator bombers attacking targets in Romania using the Ukraine-Romania-Italy routes. ;Yak-9M Yak-9D with the cockpit moved 0.4 m (1 ft 4 in) to the rear like on Yak-9T, numerous fixes and improvements based on experience with previous versions. ;Yak-9M PVO Yak-9M with slightly reduced fuel capacity, Klimov VK-105PF2 engine with , and radio and navigational equipment for night and adverse weather flying for PVO Strany. HB-RYA flying next to Pierre Avois, VS, Switzerland ;Yak-9 MPVO Single-seat night fighter aircraft, equipped with a searchlight and an RPK-10 radio compass. ;Yak-9S Yak-9M with Klimov VK-105PF engine, new propeller, and armament consisting of 1 √ó Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 cannon with 60 rounds, and 2 √ó Berezin B-20 cannons with 120 rounds. Did not enter production due to poor performance compared to Yak-3 and Yak-9U. ;Yak-9R Single-seat tactical reconnaissance aircraft. ;Yak-9P 300px This aircraft was the last and the most advanced version of the Yak-9 fighter, which became the pinnacle of development among A. S. Yakovlev's piston-engined fighters. The Yak-9P (Product P) that appeared in 1946 was a modification of the Yak-9U fighter of composite construction. Unlike its predecessor, it had all-metal wings with elliptical tips. By this time, the manufacture of high-strength aluminum alloys was established in the Soviet Union, simplifying aircraft operation and increasing aircraft service life. ;Yak-9P (VK-107) Yak-9U with an all-metal wing, Yak-9P in this case was a factory designation different from Yak-9P with two ShVAKs (see above). ;Yak-9PD High-altitude interceptor (unrelated to the two other Yak-9P above) with Klimov M-105PD engine designed specifically to intercept Luftwaffe Junkers Ju 86P high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft overflying Moscow in 1942‚Äì1943. Initially poor performance due to unreliable engine dramatically improved with adoption of Klimov M-106PV with water injection, with the aircraft reaching during testing. Armament reduced to the ShVAK cannon only to save weight. ;Yak-9U (VK-105) Yak-9T with Klimov VK-105PF2 engine and numerous aerodynamic and structural improvements introduced on Yak-3. Main visual difference from Yak-9T was in the oil coolers in the wing roots like on Yak-3 and in plywood covering of the fuselage instead of fabric. Visually differed from Yak-3 only by main landing gear covers. Armament increased to 1 √ó VYa with 60 rounds and 2 √ó UBSs with 170 rpg. The VYa cannon could be replaced by a ShVAK, B-20, or NS-37, the latter requiring removal of the starboard UBS machine gun. Did not enter production because the VYa cannon was considered unsatisfactory and because the one cannon, one machine gun armament seen on previous models offered a significant increase in range. ;Yak-9U (VK-107) The definitive Yak-9 variant, Yak-9U (VK-105) equipped with the new Klimov VK-107A engine with , and the ShVAK with 120 rounds replacing the VYa. Weight of fire: . Early test flights in 1943 indicated that the only comparable Soviet fighter was Polikarpov I-185 prototype which was more difficult to fly and less agile due to higher weight. The prototype's top speed of at was faster than any other production fighter aircraft in the world at the time, other than the P-51B that could reach up to on military power. Early problems with overheating were fixed by enlarging the radiators and production aircraft had further improved aerodynamics. Turning ability to complete a circle: 23 sec, best Soviet fighter at altitude. ;Yak-9UV Two-seat trainer version of Yak-9U (VK-107), armament reduced to a single Berezin B-20 cannon with 100 rounds. Did not enter production due to introduction of jet aircraft. ;Yak-9UT Yak-9U (VK-107) armed with 1 √ó Nudelman N-37 cannon with 30 rounds and 2 x Berezin B-20 cannons with 120 rpg, giving a one-second burst mass of . Similarly to Yak-9TK could be converted to replace the N-37 with a B-20, NS-23, or N-45. Production aircraft carried NS-23 instead of the N-37 cannon as the default armament. ;Yak-9V Two-seat trainer version of Yak-9M and Yak-9T, Klimov VK-105PF2 engine, armament reduced to 1 √ó ShVAK with 90 rounds. ;Modern replicas In the early 1990s, Yakovlev started limited production for the warbird market of Yak-9 and Yak-3 replica aircraft using original World War II equipment and Allison V-1710 engines. These modern-built replicas using the Allison engines, have counterclockwise-rotation props, unlike the originals which strictly used clockwise-rotation Soviet V12 powerplants.

History  In 1956, P&G; researcher Victor Mills disliked changing the cloth diapers of his newborn grandchild. He assigned fellow researchers in P&G;'s Exploratory Division in Miami Valley, Ohio to look into making a better disposable diaper. Pampers were introduced in 1961. They were created by researchers at P&G; including Vic Mills and Norma Lueders Baker. The name \\"Pampers\\" was coined by Alfred Goldman, Creative Director at Benton & Bowles, the first ad agency for the account. These early diapers were bulky, heavy products composed of fluff pulp with a rayon topsheet, polyethylene backsheet. In 1966, Pampers launched a 'wingfold' design and by 1969 started a \\"third size\\". By this time, Pampers had become a national brand in the United States. Procter and Gamble replaced the pin-on design with tapes in 1971. Toddler and Premature Infant sizes were also introduced. In 1973, P&G; developed elasticized single and double gussets around the leg and waist areas to aid in fitting and in containing urine or stool which had not been absorbed. In fact, the first patent for the use of double gussets in a diaper was in 1973 by P&G.;Mario S Marsan. \\"Disposable Diaper \\", US Patent 3710797, Issued January 16, 1973. In 1982, Pampers introduced an elasticized wingfold diaper with elastic leg gathers and refastenable tapes which was a cross between the early 1960s design and the modern hourglass shape, a feature that was first introduced on Luvs in 1976 and evolved into an industry standard in 1985. In 1986, thin diapers made with absorbent gelling material were released. This made the average weight of a typical medium size diaper decrease by 50%.Mya Min Cho \\"\\", Page 8- History of Procter & Gamble In 1987, Pampers and Huggies both introduced frontal tape systems which allow repositioning of the lateral tape without tearing the diaper. In the 1990s Pampers introduced a thinner diaper known as Ultra Dry Thins. The early 1990s also saw the introduction of gender-specific diapers in the Pampers brand; the product returned to unisex diapers towards the end of the decade. In 1993, Pampers introduced training pants, but the Pampers Trainers were a short lived product. Pampers did not sell training pants again until the introduction of Easy Up. In 1996, P&G; acquired Baby Fresh wipes from Kimberly-Clark; Kimberly-Clark had recently acquired Baby Fresh owner Scott Paper Company and was ordered to sell the wipes business.Procter Wipes Up Towelette Brands In 1998, Procter & Gamble introduced its largest diaper at the time, Pampers Baby-Dry Size 6. It was promoted in an advertising campaign featuring pediatrician and child development expert Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, who said to let the child decide when the time is right to potty train. The size 6 diapers were billed for growing toddlers. Huggies also introduced a size 6 diaper at this time. In 2018 the company launched its newest diaper line called Pampers Pure which was designed without chlorine bleaching, fragrance, lotion, parabens, natural rubber latex and 26 allergens identified by the European Union. The wipes launched with the new collection contain 99% water and premium cotton. Pampers announced that the goal was to give parents an option for an affordable natural diaper brand. Feedback In March 2010, Pampers announced a change to their popular Cruisers and Swaddlers diapers with the addition of the new Dry-Max technology.

In May 2010, a lawsuit was filed against Procter & Gamble based on the injuries allegedly caused by the diapers.First Lawsuit Filed Against P&G; Over New Pampers, WLWT.com, 2010-05-13. In September 2010, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission issued the results of its investigation into the matter, finding no evidence that these diapers cause diaper rash.  Advertising  Pampers is marketed in various ways, such as print ads and television commercials. Print ads often appear in magazines and other periodicals. Television commercials appear during soap operas co-produced by Procter and Gamble, such as Bold and the Beautiful & Young and the Restless, and during the airing of parenting shows. Another way Pampers is promoted is through product placement. Pampers paid $50,000 to be featured in the film Three Men and a Baby. P&G; has also sponsored the program Make Room for Baby on the Discovery Health Channel. Pampers has been promoted in some countries on billboards. Another method that has been used to promote the product is direct marketing program where relevant content is mailed to mothers with babies. These mailings can include Pampers samples or Pampers Coupons. P&G; contributes to flood relief efforts in Pakistan in part through its Pampers brand and \\"Spread a Smile\\" campaign, which provides free health check-ups, medicines, and oral rehydration therapy to babies and children living in the flood affected areas.P&G; steps up to touch & improve the lives of flood affected families.

Biography Dundas was born in Oxford, the second son of Lawrence Dundas, 3rd Marquess of Zetland, and his wife Penelope Pike. As a younger son of a marquess, he is entitled to the courtesy title 'Lord'. He was educated at Harrow and the Central School of Speech and Drama. While at the Central School, Dundas shared a Camden Town house with actor Vivian MacKerrell and film director Bruce Robinson. The house on Albert Street had been bought by his parents for him to live in, eventually according to Dundas himself \\"15 people were living there - there were three bedrooms\\". Those years served as the basis for Robinson's unpublished memoir and the film Withnail & I (1987). Dundas co-wrote the score for the film, considered \\"one of Britain's biggest cult films\\". On 17 December 1971, Dundas married Corinna Maeve Wolfe Scott, and they had two children: *Daisy Star (born 1975) *Thomas Harry Django (born 1981) They divorced in 1995. Dundas then married Taina Bettina Breuckmann on 21 November 1997, and they have one son: *Eben Finn (born 2000) Musical career His 1976 single \\"Jeans On\\" reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart, No. 17 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and No. 1 in the German Singles Chart, where the song remained 19 weeks in the Top Ten.G√ºnter Ehnert: Hit Bilanz.

The single was later sampled by Fatboy Slim for his track \\"Sho Nuff\\" which was also used in an advertisement in 2006 for SEAT Ibiza. Dundas's follow-up single, \\"Another Funny Honeymoon\\" was a medium-sized hit, reaching No. 29 in the UK. Dundas performed the song live on the BBC Television show, Top of the Pops, in 1977. A later single, \\"Where Were You Today\\", based on a C&A; radio commercial (\\"Come and C and A\\" being replaced by the song title) was less successful. Jingles made by Dundas for Capital Radio were played daily on the station in the 1970s: \\"Grab a little piece of heaven, with Roger Scott from 3 to 7\\" and \\"Get a little soft rock, country, blues, with Tony Myatt from 11 to 2\\".

L. barbarum and L. chinense fruits are similar but can be distinguished by differences in taste and sugar content. Both species are native to Asia, and have been long used in traditional Asian cuisine. The fruit has also been an ingredient in traditional Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese medicine, since at least the 3rd century AD.Nobuo Kawahara, ed. (2011): \\"Comparative Studies on Pharmacopoeial Definitions, Requirements and Information for Crude Drugs among FHH Member Countries in 2007\\". Western Pacific Regional Forum for the Harmonization of Herbal Medicines (FHH). Online document, accessed on 2018-06-12. The plant parts are called by the Latin names lycii fructus (fruit), herba lycii (leaves), etc., in modern official pharmacopeias.\\"Lycii fructus\\", European Pharmacopoea 9.3, page 4812Ray Upton et al., editors (2010): \\"Lycium chinense Mill, L. barbarum L., Lycium fruit, Lycii fructus\\". In American Herbal Pharmacopoeia Botanical Pharmacognosy: Microscopic Characterization Of Botanical Medicines, page 468. Published by CRC Press. Since about 2000, goji berry and derived products became common in developed countries as health foods or alternative medicine remedies, extending from exaggerated and unproven claims about their health benefits.  Etymology and naming The genus name Lycium was assigned by Linnaeus in 1753. The Latin name lycium is derived from the Greek word ŒªœÖŒ∫ŒπŒøŒΩ (lykion), used by Pliny the Elder (23-79) and Pedanius Dioscorides (ca. 40-90) for a plant known as dyer's buckthorn, which was probably a Rhamnus species. The Greek word refers to the ancient region of Lycia (ŒõœÖŒ∫ŒØŒ±) in Anatolia, where that plant grew.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan . The common English name, \\"wolfberry\\", has unknown origin. It may have arisen from the mistaken assumption that the Latin name Lycium was derived from Greek ŒªœçŒ∫ŒøœÇ (lycos) meaning \\"wolf\\". In the English-speaking world, the name \\"goji berry\\" has been used since around 2000. The word \\"goji\\" is an approximation of the pronunciation of g«íuq«ê (pinyin for Êû∏Êùû), the name for the berry producing plant L. chinense in several Chinese dialects. In technical botanical nomenclature, L. barbarum is called matrimony vine while L. chinense is Chinese desert-thorn.  Uses  =Traditional Asian cuisine= Young wolfberry shoots and leaves are harvested commercially as a leaf vegetable. =Food= Fresh goji berries (The wrinkling is due to postharvest dehydration.) Dried goji berriesSince the early 21st century, the dried fruit has been marketed as a health food, with unsupported health claims about its benefits.McNally A. Superfoods market set to double by 2011, NutraIngredients.com-Europe, October 8, 2007Runestad T. Functional Ingredients market overview, Functional Ingredients, October 2007 In the wake of those claims, dried and fresh goji berries were included in many snack foods and food supplements, such as granola bars. There are products of whole and ground wolfberry seeds and seed oil. Marketing controversies Among the extreme claims used to market the product, often referred to as a \\"superfruit\\", is the unsupported story that a Chinese man named Li Qing Yuen, who was said to have consumed wolfberries daily, lived to the age of 256 years (1677‚Äì1933). This claim apparently originated in a 2003 booklet by Earl Mindell, who claimed also that goji had anti-cancer properties.Earl Mindell and Rick Handel (2003), \\"Goji: The Himalyan Health Secret\\". Momentum Media, 58 pages. The booklet contained false and unverified claims. Such exaggerated claims about the health benefits of goji berry and derived products triggered strong reactions, including from government regulatory agencies. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed two goji juice distributors on notice with warning letters about unproven therapeutic benefits.US FDA Letter to Dynamic Health Laboratories, Inc.US FDA, Letter to Healthsuperstore.com These statements were in violation of the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act [21 USC/321 (g)(1)] because they \\"establish[ed] the product as a drug intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease\\" when wolfberries or juice have had no such scientific evaluation. Additionally stated by the FDA, the goji juice was \\"not generally recognized as safe and effective for the referenced conditions\\" and therefore must be treated as a \\"new drug\\" under Section 21(p) of the Act. New drugs may not be legally marketed in the United States without prior approval of the FDA. In January 2007, marketing statements for a goji juice product were the subject of an investigative report by consumer advocacy program Marketplace produced by the Canadian television network, CBC. In the interview, Earl Mindell (then working for direct-marketing company FreeLife International, Inc.) falsely claimed the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York had completed clinical studies showing that use of wolfberry juice would prevent 75% of human breast cancer cases. On May 29, 2009, a class action lawsuit was filed against FreeLife in the United States District Court of Arizona. This lawsuit alleged false claims, misrepresentations, false and deceptive advertising and other issues regarding FreeLife‚Äôs Himalayan Goji Juice, GoChi, and TaiSlim products. This lawsuit sought remedies for consumers who had purchased the products over years.Class-Action Suit Filed against FreeLife and Earl Mindell A settlement agreement was reached on April 28, 2010, where FreeLife took steps to ensure that its goji products were not marketed as \\"unheated\\" or \\"raw\\", and made a contribution to an educational organization. As with many other novel \\"health\\" foods and supplements, the lack of clinical evidence and poor quality control in the manufacture of consumer products prevent goji from being clinically recommended or applied. Scientific research Wolfberry seed oil from Lycium barbarum in a clear glass vialBecause of the numerous effects claimed by traditional medicine, there has been considerable basic research to investigate possible medicinal uses of substances contained in the fruit. The composition of the fruits, seeds, roots, and other parts have been analyzed in detail, and extracts are under study in vitro and in vivo. However, no clinical effectiveness of such extracts has been confirmed . Safety =Interaction with drugs= In vitro testing suggests that unidentified wolfberry phytochemicals in goji tea may inhibit metabolism of other medications, such as those processed by the cytochrome P450 liver enzymes. Such drugs include warfarin, or drugs for diabetes or hypertension. =Pesticide and fungicide residues= Organochlorine pesticides are conventionally used in commercial wolfberry cultivation to mitigate infestation by insects. China's Green Food Standard, administered by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture's China Green Food Development Center, does permit some amount of pesticide and herbicide use.Pathbreaking Newsletter Promotes Development of Organic Sector in China Lila Buckley.

Since the early 21st century, high levels of insecticide residues (including fenvalerate, cypermethrin, and acetamiprid) and fungicide residues (such as triadimenol and isoprothiolane), have been detected by the United States Food and Drug Administration in some imported wolfberries and wolfberry products of Chinese origin, leading to the seizure of these products.  Cultivation and commercialization Dried goji berries on sale in a market in France Defrosted goji berries Wolfberries are most often sold in dried form. When ripe, the oblong, red berries are tender and must be picked carefully or shaken from the vine into trays to avoid spoiling. The fruits are preserved by drying them in full sun on open trays or by mechanical dehydration, employing a progressively increasing series of heat exposure over 48 hours. = China = China is the main supplier of wolfberry products in the world, with total exports generating US$120 million in 2004. This production derived from 82,000 hectares farmed nationwide, yielding 95,000 tons of wolfberries. The majority of commercially produced wolfberry (50,000 tons in 2013, accounting for 45% of China's total yield) comes from L. barbarum plantations in the Ningxia and Xinjiang in Northwestern China, totaling 200,000 acres as of 2005.. The cultivation is centered in Zhongning County, Ningxia, where wolfberry plantations typically range between 40 and 400 hectares (100‚Äì1000 acres or 500‚Äì6000 mu) in area. Ningxia goji has been cultivated along the fertile floodplains of the Yellow River for more than 700 years. They are sometimes described commercially as \\"red diamonds\\". The region has developed an industrial association of growers, processors, marketers, and scholars of wolfberry cultivation to promote the berry's commercial and export potential. Ningxia goji is the variety used by practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine. Wolfberries are celebrated each August in Ningxia with an annual festival coinciding with the berry harvest. Xinhua News Agency, Opening ceremonies of Ningxia wolfberry festival, August 3, 2005. Originally held in Ningxia's capital, Yinchuan, the festival has been based since 2000 in Zhongning County. Besides Ningxia, commercial volumes of wolfberries grow in the Chinese regions of Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Hebei. = United Kingdom = Lycium barbarum had been introduced in the United Kingdom in the 1730s by The Duke of Argyll, but the plant was mostly used for hedges and decorative gardening. The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) had initially placed goji berry in the Novel Foods list.The Novel Foods and Novel Food Ingredients Regulations 1997 That classification would have required authorisation from the European Council and Parliament for marketing. However, on June 18, 2007, the FSA concluded that there was a significant history of consumption of the fruit before 1997, indicating its safety, and thus removed it from the list.Responses on goji berries reviewed, UK Food Standards Agency, June 2007 = Canada and United States = In the first decade of the 21st century, farmers in Canada and the United States began cultivating goji on a commercial scale to meet potential markets for fresh berries, juice, and processed products. = Australia = Australia imports the majority of its goji berries from China, due to how expensive the Australian labour force is in comparison with the countries that have the largest share of the current market.

It took place in both the Americas and Europe, including the United States (1765‚Äì1783), Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (1788‚Äì1792), France and French-controlled Europe (1789‚Äì1814), Haiti (1791‚Äì1804), Ireland (1798) and Spanish America (1810‚Äì1825).Wim Klooster, Revolutions in the Atlantic World: A Comparative History (2009) There were smaller upheavals in Switzerland, Russia, and Brazil.

Revolution!: The Atlantic World Reborn (2011) Independence movements in the New World began with the American Revolution, 1765-1783, in which France, the Netherlands and Spain assisted the new United States of America as it secured independence from Britain. In the 1790s the Haitian Revolution broke out. With Spain tied down in European wars, the mainland Spanish colonies secured independence around 1820.Jaime E. Rodr√≠guez O., The Independence of Spanish America (1998) In long-term perspective, the revolutions were mostly successful. They spread widely the ideals of liberalism, republicanism, the overthrow of aristocracies, kings and established churches. They emphasized the universal ideals of the Enlightenment, such as the equality of all men, including equal justice under law by disinterested courts as opposed to particular justice handed down at the whim of a local noble. They showed that the modern notion of revolution, of starting fresh with a radically new government, could actually work in practice. Revolutionary mentalities were born and continue to flourish to the present day.Robert R. Palmer, The Age of the Democratic Revolution: A Political History of Europe and America, 1760‚Äì1800. (2 vol, 1959‚Äì1964) The common Atlantic theme breaks down to some extent from reading the works of Edmund Burke. Burke firstly supported the American colonists in 1774 in \\"On American Taxation\\", and took the view that their property and other rights were being infringed by the crown without their consent. In apparent contrast, Burke distinguished and deplored the process of the French revolution in Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), as in this case property, customary and religious rights were being removed summarily by the revolutionaries and not by the crown. In both cases he was following Montesquieu's theory that the right to own property is an essential element of personal freedom.

It was founded in the late 1860s, designed by William James Audsley and George Ashdown Audsley and consecrated on 2 September 1874. It is widely regarded as the finest example of the Moorish Revival style of synagogue architecture in Great Britain.Sharples, Joseph (2004). Pevsner Architectural guide to Liverpool, Yale University Press, p. 249 Synagogues emulating its design are to be found as far afield as Sydney. History Princes Road Synagogue came into existence when the Jewish community in Liverpool in the late 1860s decided to build itself a new synagogue, reflecting the status and wealth of the community. The Toxteth area was rapidly expanding as Liverpool's magnates built opulent mansions. The synagogue stands in a cluster of houses of worship designed to advertise the wealth and status of the local captains of industry, a group that was remarkably ethnically diverse, by the standards of Victorian England. Immediately adjacent to Princes Road are the magnificent Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas, the Anglican parish of St Margaret of Antioch, and a handsome, early French Gothic, Welsh Presbyterian Church. The synagogue was designed by William James Audsley and George Ashdown Audsley, architect brothers from Edinburgh, and built at a cost of ¬£14,975 8s 11d. It was consecrated on 2 September 1874. Meek describes the building as \\"eclectic\\" and states that the Princes Road Synagogue exemplifies the characteristic eclectic architecture in harmoniously blending features drawn from different styles. The ladies of the Liverpool Old Hebrew Congregation held a bazaar and luncheon in February 1874. They invited the important dignitaries and arranged for the band of the Coldstream Guards to play. The event raised the then massive sum of ¬£3,000 with some change. The ¬£3,000 was donated to the synagogue for the decoration of the interior. In today's (2005's) terms it was something in the region of ¬£750,000. The synagogue is a testament to the wealth and social position of Liverpool's nineteenth-century Jewish magnates, a group with the wealth and taste also to commission Max Bruch to compose the Kol Nidre variations for cello and orchestra. The synagogue today is attended only on Sabbath mornings and holidays, though it remains popular for weddings and bar mitzvah celebrations. Description The synagogue is of brick construction, with bright terracotta bricks being used extensively for decoration. The facade reveals the plan of the building, a basilica with nave and aisles. The central section juts forward from the aisles. It has a large \\"Moorish\\" portal divided by a central column, above which is a large wheel window in the Romanesque style, both deeply recessed in arches. The synagogue has a central nave with aisles on either side, separated by an arcade carried on slender octagonal columns, which also support galleries over the aisles. The nave has a barrel vault lit by clerestory windows. The interior is notable for its lavish decoration, including gilding and unstinting use of the finest woods and marbles. H. A. Meek says, \\"He who has not seen the interior of Princes Road synagogue in Liverpool has not beheld the glory of Israel.\\"Meek, H. A. (1995).

Goldberg has won fourteen Emmy Awards and was a producer, reporter and correspondent for CBS News for twenty-eight years (1972-2000) and a paid contributor for Fox News for ten years (2009-2018). He is best-known for his on-going critiques of journalism practices in the United States - as described in his first book published in 2001, Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News. He is a correspondent for Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel on HBO. Personal background Goldberg was born in New York City, New York in 1945 and graduated from Rutgers University in 1967. Personal politics Though frequently described as a conservative, Goldberg previously rejected the label, describing himself as a life-long liberal modeled after the 1960s ideals of the U.S. Democratic Party. In a February 22, 2012 interview, Goldberg said: \\"The reason (people claim I'm conservative) is so I'll be automatically marginalized. I wrote in 'Bias' that I would make racial discrimination a criminal offense, not just a civil offense. On gay rights, I don‚Äôt know anyone more Libertarian than me. I don‚Äôt want the government getting involved in it. I‚Äôm pro-abortion with reservations. I‚Äôve never set foot in a country club in my life. I consider myself to be an old- fashioned liberal. I‚Äôm a liberal the way liberals used to be when they were like John F. Kennedy and when they were like Hubert Humphrey, when they were upbeat and enthusiastic and mainstream. I am not a liberal the way liberals are today, at least as exemplified by Al Franken and Michael Moore, where they‚Äôre angry, nasty, closed minded, and not mainstream, but fringe. I think this is what really irks the media (about me). That this is coming from one of them. I was one of them for 28 years.\\" Goldberg has since accepted the label of \\"conservative,\\" saying in 2020, \\"I see myself as a conservative with live and let live principles‚Ä¶ a conservative libertarian I guess. Now, even when I agree with liberals on this issue or that, I no longer want to be on their team. I not only don‚Äôt accept their new left wing politics, it‚Äôs also their holier than thou elitism that annoys me. I no longer see myself as a liberal. They left me, not the other way around. Now, I‚Äôm a conservative. Not a right- wing nut, just a conservative with libertarian tendencies.\\" Career From 1972 to 1974 he worked for CBS News as a producer in Atlanta; he became a reporter in 1974 and correspondent in 1976. Goldberg frequently contributed to the CBS Evening News and CBS newsmagazines Eye to Eye with Connie Chung and 48 Hours. For CBS, he hosted two primetime documentaries, Don't Blame Me and In Your Face, America. Don't Blame Me was broadcast on May 26, 1994 and explored alleged irresponsibility of Americans. In Your Face, America, which aired on April 7, 1998, said that American culture suffers from a \\"coarsening\\" instigated by entertainment such as The Jerry Springer Show, South Park, and gangsta rap music. In 2001, his first book, Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News was published and became a number one New York Times bestseller. Goldberg followed Bias with two books ‚Äì Arrogance: Rescuing America from the Media Elite in 2003 and 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America in 2005. Boston Globe journalist Cathy Young‚Äîpraised by Goldberg in 100 People‚Äîcriticized the book for listing mostly liberal or liberal-leaning individuals and only \\"a Few Token Right-Wingers\\". There were also many favorable comments about the book including one from Jonah Goldberg (no relation) who said, \\"100 People Who Are Screwing Up America is a rollicking and revealing look at 100 of the most egregious obstacles on the path of our nation's return to glory\\" and Brent Bozell, who commented: \\"100 People Who Are Screwing Up America is out, and it's a wonderful read for anyone not on that list.\\"The Book on One-Sidedness The Boston Globe, August 15, 2005 Crazies to the Left of Me, Wimps to the Right: How One Side Lost Its Mind and the Other Lost Its Nerve followed in 2007, then came A Slobbering Love Affair: The True (And Pathetic) Story of the Torrid Romance Between Barack Obama and the Mainstream Media in 2009. Both books were also national bestsellers with A Slobbering Love Affair hitting number two on the New York Times list. Awards Goldberg has been awarded an Emmy for journalism 14 times (six at CBS News, eight at HBO). For his June 2000 segment \\"Dominican Free For All\\", in which he investigated corrupt Major League Baseball recruiting practices in the Dominican Republic, Goldberg won a Sports Emmy for \\"Outstanding Sports Journalism\\". He won that award again in 2005 for his story exposing Saudi Arabia's illegal use of young boys as camel jockeys, in 2008 for a story about post-concussion syndrome suffered by some former NFL players, and in 2009 for a story on Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel about the slaughter of racehorses that were no longer making money for their owners.\\"Winners of 30th Annual Sports Emmy Awards announced\\" . EmmyOnline.tv. National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, April 27, 2009. (Press release). In May, 2011 Goldberg won another sports Emmy, this one for his story on the connection between head trauma suffered by athletes and a disease similar to ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.\\"Fang's Bites\\" May 3, 2011. In April 2012, Goldberg won his 12th Emmy, this one for a report on the College Bowl Money Trail.\\"TV by the Numbers\\" And in May 2017, he won yet another Emmy, his 13th for an investigation into the International Olympic Committee. May 1, 2012. And in May 2017, he won his 13th Emmy for an investigation of the International Olympic Committee. Later that year, in October 2017, Goldberg won another Emmy, a News Emmy in the Investigative Reporting category, for his story on head injuries in youth football. Goldberg received the Alfred I. duPont- Columbia University Award in 2006 for a story on the exploitation of children in the United Arab Emirates. It marked the first time that a sports program had won a duPont award.Realsports Awards HBO.com. December 14, 2005. In 2012, Goldberg won his second duPont for a body of work on concussions in the NFL, the duPont committee saying that, \\"Correspondent Bernard Goldberg's interviews are sensitive and probing, moving the story forward. Goldberg and his team investigate the historical precedent of Lou Gehrig bringing to light new information about concussions he suffered as a baseball player at Columbia University and as a Yankee. The reporting raised awareness for the public, the NFL and Congress about this important health issue.\\"Columbia Journalism School\\" Journalism Awards, 2012. In 2018, Bernie and a team of Real Sports journalists won another duPont-Columbia Award for a story about the Olympics entitled ‚ÄúLord of the Rings.‚Äù As the duPont committee described it: \\"This ambitions investigative report ‚Äî filmed in nine countries ‚Äî exposed graft and corruption in the IOC and detailed how its members pursue wealth, privilege, and self-glory at the expense of the Games.

Description It rises in the Southern Alps, travelling in a generally easterly or southeasterly direction before entering the Pacific Ocean south of Christchurch. It forms a hapua as it reaches the ocean. For much of its journey, the river is braided, running through a wide shingle bed. Close to Mount Hutt, however, it is briefly confined to a narrow canyon known as the Rakaia Gorge. The Rakaia River is bridged in two places. The busiest crossing is at the small town of Rakaia, from the river mouth, where State Highway 1 and the South Island Main Trunk Railway cross the river using separate bridges.

Nicholas G. Carr (born 1959) is an American writer who has published books and articles on technology, business, and culture. His book The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains was a finalist for the 2011 Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction. Career Nicholas Carr originally came to prominence with the 2003 Harvard Business Review article \\"IT Doesn't Matter\\" and the 2004 book Does IT Matter? Information Technology and the Corrosion of Competitive Advantage (Harvard Business School Press). In these widely discussed works, he argued that the strategic importance of information technology in business has diminished as IT has become more commonplace, standardized and cheaper. His ideas roiled the information technology industry,Twilight Of The Pc Era? December 8, 2003 spurring heated outcries from executives of Microsoft, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and other leading technology companies, although the ideas got mixed responses from other commentators.IT Doesn't Matter--response to critics 2004Why IT Does Matter August 25, 2003Does IT Matter? An HBR Debate June 2003 In 2005, Carr published the controversial article \\"The End of Corporate Computing\\" in the MIT Sloan Management Review, in which he argued that in the future companies will purchase information technology as a utility service from outside suppliers. Carr's second book, The Big Switch: Rewiring the World, From Edison to Google, was published in January 2008 by W. W. Norton. It examines the economic and social consequences of the rise of Internet-based \\"cloud computing\\" comparing the consequences to those that occurred with the rise of electric utilities in the early 20th century.An eye-opening look at the new computer revolution and the coming transformation of our economy, society, and culture December 2007 In the summer of 2008, The Atlantic published Carr's article \\"Is Google Making Us Stupid?\\" as the cover story of its annual Ideas issue. Highly critical of the Internet's effect on cognition, the article has been read and debated widely in both the media and the blogosphere. Carr's main argument is that the Internet may have detrimental effects on cognition that diminish the capacity for concentration and contemplation. Carr's 2010 book, The Shallows, develops this argument further. Discussing various examples ranging from Nietzsche's typewriter to London cab drivers' GPS navigators, Carr shows how newly introduced technologies change the way people think, act and live.Very long excerpt from \\"The Shallows\\", by Nicholas Carr Jared Nielsen The book focuses on the detrimental influence of the Internet‚Äîalthough it does recognize its beneficial aspects‚Äîby investigating how hypertext has contributed to the fragmentation of knowledge. When users search the Web, for instance, the context of information can be easily ignored. \\"We don't see the trees,\\" Carr writes. \\"We see twigs and leaves.\\"Lehrer, Jonah \\"Our Cluttered Minds\\" New York Times, June 3, 2010 One of Carr's major points is that the change caused by the Internet involves the physical restructuring of the human brain, which he explains using the neuroscientific notion of \\"neuroplasticity.\\" In addition to being a Pulitzer Prize nominee, the book appeared on the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list and has been translated into 17 languages. In January 2008 Carr became a member of the Editorial Board of Advisors of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.Nicholas Carr, David Gelernter & Michael Wesch: New Britannica Advisors ‚Äì Britannica Blog, January 25, 2008 Earlier in his career, Carr served as executive editor of the Harvard Business Review. He was educated at Dartmouth College and Harvard University.Profile at Carr's blog In 2014, Carr published his fourth book, \\"The Glass Cage: Automation and Us\\", which presents a critical examination of the role of computer automation in contemporary life. Spanning historical, technical, economic, and philosophical viewpoints, the book has been widely acclaimed by reviewers, with the New York Times Sunday Book Review terming it \\"essential.\\" In 2016, Carr published \\"Utopia Is Creepy: and Other Provocations\\", a collection of blog posts, essays, and reviews from 2005 to 2016. The book provides a critique of modern American techno-utopianism, which TIME magazine said \\"punches a hole in Silicon Valley cultural hubris.\\" Blog Through his blog \\"Rough Type,\\" Carr has been a critic of technological utopianism and in particular the populist claims made for online social production. In his 2005 blog essay titled \\"The Amorality of Web 2.0,\\" he criticized the quality of volunteer Web 2.0 information projects such as Wikipedia and the blogosphere and argued that they may have a net negative effect on society by displacing more expensive professional alternatives.The Amorality of Web 2.0 October 2005 In a response to Carr's criticism, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales admitted that the Wikipedia articles quoted by Carr \\"are, quite frankly, a horrific embarrassment\\" and solicited recommendations for improving Wikipedia's quality.A valid criticism October 6, 2005 In May 2007, Carr argued that the dominance of Wikipedia pages in many search results represents a dangerous consolidation of Internet traffic and authority, which may be leading to the creation of what he called \\"information plantations\\".The net is being carved up into information plantations May 17, 2007 Carr coined the term \\"wikicrats\\" (a pejorative description of Wikipedia administrators) in August 2007, as part of a more general critique of what he sees as Wikipedia's tendency to develop ever more elaborate and complex systems of rules and bureaucratic rank or caste over time.Rise of the wikicrats August 23, 2007 Nicholas Carr speaking at the 12th Annual Gilder/Forbes Telecosm Conference at The Sagamore Resort in Lake George, New York on May 28, 2008.

He is known for his intellectual approach to rabbinic literature, which he juxtaposed with contemporary Spanish Kabbalah.  Biography  Probably born in Aragon, his father Rav Abraham Aboab, had a close relationship with the Crown of Aragon, being gifted land and a heraldic achievement by James I of Aragon in 1263. In his early years Rabbi Isaac worked as a merchants, later moving to Toledo, Castile around 1300. In Toledo, he headed his own yeshiva, and amongst his pupils was Jacob Berab. He mostly taught Jewish ethics, later serving in the rabbinate in Toledo. Towards the end of his life, he devoted much of his time to literary work and to preaching, as he found that great Talmudic scholars and important seats of learning of his time to be antiquated. In his time, the Jews for whom he wrote still understood and spoke Arabic and he belonged to a period of intellectual decline when men took naturally to eclecticism. He combined extensive rabbinical knowledge with philosophical erudition, and was fond of mystic interpretation of the Mosaic laws and ceremonies. He often quoted Aristotle and Plato, though only from secondary sources, and endeavored to illustrate passages from the Talmud and the midrashic literature, with which he was especially familiar. He is sometimes confused with his great-great-grandson Isaac Aboab II, who was a bible commentator in Castile in the late 15th century. Works Aboab wrote three books: #Aron Ha-Edut (◊ê◊®◊ï◊ü ◊î◊¢◊ì◊ï◊™) (\\"The Ark of the Testimony\\") - The work traces various ritual laws to their Talmudic sources, as well as the decisions of the Geonim and later interpretations. It is divided (following the Ten Commandments) into ten sections, each subdivided into chapters and paragraphs. #Shul·∏•an Ha-Panim (◊©◊ú◊ó◊ü ◊î◊§◊†◊ô◊ù) (\\"Table of the Showbread\\") - The work relates to the prayers and benedictions. It is divided into twelve sections, symbolizing the twelve loaves of the showbread in the Tabernacle. Both works unfortunately are lost. #Menorat Ha-Maor (◊û◊†◊ï◊®◊™ ◊î◊û◊ê◊ï◊®) (\\"The Menorah of Light\\") - The work is a collection of midrashic sermons. =Menorat haMaor= Menorat haMaor has survived and won considerable fame for the author, though in his humility he assures his readers that he composed it chiefly for his own use as a public speaker. But besides this it has contributed probably more than any other medieval book to the popularization of rabbinical lore and to the religious edification and elevation of the masses. It belongs to that class of ethical works which sprang up in the 13th century in a time of reaction against the one-sided manner in which Talmudic studies had been previously pursued. Aboab says in the preface of this work, \\"These Talmudists consider it their duty to propose difficult questions and answer them in a witty and subtle manner, but leave unnoticed the precious pearls that lie upon the bed of the Talmudic ocean, the aggadic passages (similar to Midrash) so rich in beauty and sweetness.\\" He conceived, therefore, the plan of grouping together the rich material stored up in the vast treasure-house of Aggadah from the religious and ethical point of view, and of presenting it in a book, intending by it to illumine the minds and the hearts of his coreligionists. Alluding to the seven-armed Menorah in the Tabernacle, he divided the book into seven sections, each of which bears the title of Ner or \\"Lamp\\" subdivided into separate parts and chapters. The seven \\"Nerim\\" or sections are: # \\"Do not to chase after luxuries\\" - Divided into three sections about jealousy, lust, and respect. # \\"Do not speak sinfully\\" - Divided into ten sections about frivolousness speech, lying, flattery, slander, humiliation of others, keeping secrets, fighting with others, tiredness, life purpose, and the sin of insulting others. # \\"Keep the commandments\\" - Divided into ten sections about circumcision, the duty of the father to his son, prayer, honouring Shabbat and Yom Kippur, honouring one's father and mother, marriage, charity, volunteering, honesty in court, and the pursuance of mitzvoth. # \\"Matters of Talmud Torah\\" - Divided into four sections about the importance of setting time to learn Torah, the reward of learning Torah, Torah wisdom, and the importance of respecting Torah sages. # \\"Repentance\\" - Divided into three sections about matters of repentance, the days of repentance, and the torment of sin. # \\"Living in peace\\" - Divided into two sections about respecting others and advice on how to live peacefully. # \\"Humility\\" - Divided into two sections about the importance of humility and the sin of humiliation. Aboab supplied to the average reader a great need of the time. Its skillful arrangement of the various Biblical and rabbinical topics and its warm tone of deep earnestness and sincerity could not fail to appeal to the popular heart. The work was translated into Spanish and read to attentive assemblies of the people, particularly to those not versed in the Law. It thus became the household book of the medieval Jews. The Abuhav synagogue in Safed, said to be designed by AboabIt was published with a Spanish translation (Leghorn, 1657), with a Hebrew commentary and a Jud√¶o- German translation by Moses Frankfurter (Amsterdam, 1701), with a modern German translation by Jacob Raphael F√ºrstenthal and Benzion Behrend (Krotoschin, 1844‚Äì46). It was translated also into modern Yiddish, in Wilna, 1880. The book should not be confused with a work of the same name by Israel Alnaqua.  Abuhav synagogue  It is said that after their expulsion from Spain in 1492, Jewish exiles arrived in the Land of Israel carrying a Torah scroll scribed by Rabbi Isaac. Tradition claims that he designed a synagogue while in Spain, incorporating kabbalistic symbols into the design, which served as the building plan for the synagogue named for him in Tsfat, known as the Abuhav Synagogues.

It flows southeast for from the Southern Alps, entering the Pacific Ocean northeast of Timaru. The river has a catchment area of , and a mean annual flow of at Klondyke. The MƒÅori name \\"Rangitata\\" (Rakitata) has been variously translated as \\"day of lowering clouds\\", \\"close sky\\", and \\"the side of the sky\\". The river formed the Rangitata Valley, in the center of the Southern Alps, and the on-location photography of the Edoras set from The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and The Return of the King was filmed in this valley, on and around Mount Sunday. Several remote sheep stations are located near Mount Sunday. These include Mesopotamia, Mt Potts, and Erewhon. Erewhon was named by Samuel Butler who was the first white settler to live at the Mesopotamia sheep station. Erewhon is also the name of a novel written by Butler anonymously in 1872. In 1932 an outdoor ice skating rink was established by the river beneath Mount Harper. Before the river enters the Canterbury Plains, the river flows through the Rangitata Gorge where part of it is diverted to the Rangitata Diversion Race (RDR) for irrigation and hydroelectric generation. The RDR was built between 2 April 1937 and 1944, and supplies water to the Montalto and Highbank schemes before joining the Rakaia River. The entry point has New Zealand's first acoustic fish fence, keeping salmon smolt in the river and preventing them ending up on farmland. There is a second irrigation system which has its off take below and on the opposite river bank from the RDR. This system is called the Rangitata South Irrigation Scheme. This system rums through a static fish screen on its way into 7 man made dams, holding a total of 18,000,000 m3 of water to distribute across 16,000ha of formerly dry land farming area. This system has a fish spawning section to help bolster the number of sport fish available for recreational fishermen. Towards its mouth, the river originally split into two streams, forming a large delta island (Rangitata Island). This island was crossed by State Highway 1 and the Main South Line railway between Ealing and Rangitata and thus was an island connected directly by New Zealand's main state highway and one of its primary railway lines. However, the south branch of this split has since been blocked, and the riverbed developed for agricultural purposes. Its course remains as a flood plain, but water does not normally flow here any longer. The Rangitata is the most fished river in the Central South Island Region, having a self-sustaining Chinook salmon fishery.McDowall, R. M. (1990) New Zealand freshwater fishes: a natural history and guide. Heinemann-Reed, Auckland, 553 p. The salmon account for about 75 percent of angler activity on the river, other species fished are brown trout, rainbow trout and brook char. On 23 December 1999, Fish and Game New Zealand lodged an application for a water conservation order on the Rangitata River. In June 2006, the water conservation order was gazetted. A locomotive, DC 4686, ended up completely submerged in the river on 4 January 2002, after floodwater undermined a stopbank supporting the railway line, causing a derailment.

The Nokia 3100 was developed from the Nokia 6100 as a successor to the Nokia 3510. The phone was Nokia's first in the youth-oriented 3000-series to be equipped with a 128√ó128 pixel passive colour display (4096 colors/12-bit), and included Java MIDP 1.0, XHTML and WAP browser, GPRS, Pop-Port connectivity and Lithium-ion battery. It is also capable of playing polyphonic MIDI files, which can be used as ringtones. It is compact in size and lightweight, and also features special lighting effects.https://yenra.com/nokia-3100-phone/ Features Side view The Nokia 3100 uses Nokia's Series 40 platform firmware that has large static icons rather than the animated icons of some other Nokia phones. The phone can send and receive text and multimedia messages with ringtones and images in BMP, JPEG, PNG and GIF formats. The basic 3100 does not have a voice recorder, radio receiver, MP3 player, or camera, while the 3100b variant has voice recording. A camera can be added to the phone via its Pop-Port. The Nokia 3200 builds on the Nokia 3100, adding things like a built-in CIF-resolution camera from the Nokia 7250i. Despite the 3200 being designated as the successor to the 3100, the 3200 was less popular than the 3100; this kept the 3100 (and its redesign, the 3120) in production while the 3200 was discontinued and replaced by the Nokia 3220.  Variants  = Nokia 3100 (RH-19) = The basic version, intended to be used in European GSM networks.

The Nokia 3105 was used in Australia on the Hutchison Orange network until the closure of the CDMA network in Australia in late 2006. All customers on the Orange network were then moved to Hutchison's 3G network \\"3\\". = Nokia 3120 = Nokia 3120 Announced in 2004, the Nokia 3120 is a redesigned variant of the 3100.

Products Stratfor bills itself as a geopolitical intelligence platform, with revenues derived from individual and enterprise subscriptions to Stratfor Worldview, its online publication, and from custom advisory work for corporate clients. Stratfor has published a daily intelligence briefing since its inception in 1996. Its rise to prominence occurred with the release of its Kosovo Crisis Center during the 1999 NATO airstrikes over Kosovo, which led to publicity in Time magazine, Texas Monthly, and other publications.\\"Spies Like Us\\", Time, January 25, 1999 Before the end of 1999, however, Stratfor had introduced a subscription service through which it offered the majority of its analyses. At the time of the September 11, 2001 attacks, Stratfor made its \\"breaking news\\" paragraphs, as well as some notable analyses predicting likely actions to be taken by al-Qaeda and the Bush administration, available freely to the public. Stratfor's publishing business includes written and multimedia analysis available online or through an API, as well as iPhone and Android mobile applications.Stratfor products Stratfor Threat Lens, an enterprise level product launched in September 2016, offers specific insight and analysis to support corporate security leaders. In April 2017, the company launched its core online publication under the name Stratfor Worldview. Some of Stratfor's work remains available free to the public. Books and media Stratfor has published collections of analysis in paperback and as e-books on a variety of topics. Topics include user guides to personal security, the \\"devolution of jihadism,\\" and the U.S. war in Afghanistan, according to a series of promotional videos on the company's YouTube channel. Apparently, at one point, the books were sold through a storefront on the company's website. Stratfor e-books and long form analyses are now available through a dedicated, on-site store. A number of the company's top analysts have published books in their own name. Notable among these are founder George Friedman and vice president for intelligence Fred Burton. Kamran Bokhari, Stratfor's former vice president for Middle East and South Asian affairs, is the author (with Farid Senzai) of Political Islam in the Age of Democratization (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013). Reviewer Amani el Sehrawey called the book \\"an invaluable tool for those seeking to gain knowledge of the nuances of the political systems of the Muslim world from a historical perspective, as well as to understand the contemporary changes happening in the region.\\" Barron's once referred to Stratfor as \\"The Shadow CIA\\". (read complete article ) Barrons' Jonathan Laing has called Friedman \\"one of our favorite experts on geopolitics,\\" saying, \\"His judgments tend to be more nuanced and long-term than those of the press or Wall Street.\\" More recently, The Atlantic's James Fallows referenced a Stratfor article on U.S. strategy in Iraq and Ukraine, following outbreaks of turmoil in those regions. Friedman resigned from the company in 2015 to launch a new company, Geopolitical Futures.Pope, Colin (December 3, 2015). \\"Stratfor Founder George Friedman Starts Media Business,\\" Austin Business Journal. https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2015/12/03/stratfor-founder-george- friedman-forms.html Subscribers The member and client list for Stratfor is confidential, but the company says it includes Fortune 500 companies, universities and international government agencies as well as professionals who purchase an individual membership. Funding In October 2015, Stratfor raised $12 million in funding through a growth equity investment by Dallas- based Teakwood Capital. Stratfor's plan for the funding includes expanding its intelligence networks, enhancing operational infrastructure and moving into frontier markets. Structure and operations Stratfor clients have included academic institutions, investment firms and large corporations such as Lockheed Martin, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Coca-Cola and Dow Chemical Company. In 2008 the company was reported to have 40 full time employees in Austin. It selects interns from the nearby University of Texas. Stratfor analysts pay for information but also use open source information to predict where global crises will arise. Stratfor also obtains information by way of personal networks. Fred Burton indicated in leaked emails that he maintained contact with his \\"trusted former CIA cronies\\" as a source of information and that he was aware of the sealed indictment against Julian Assange in 2011.  Events  In October 2017, Stratfor sponsored the 2017 Texas National Security Forum organized by Clements Center for National Security, the Robert Strauss Center for International Security and Law, and the Intelligence Studies Project at The University of Texas at Austin. The theme was \\"Alliances and Partnerships in American National Security.\\" The event included a keynote address by Michael Pompeo, then director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and later U.S. Secretary of State. Stratfor Chief Security Officer Fred Burton moderated a panel that included former Acting Director of Central Intelligence John McLaughlin and former Acting Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency David Shedd.

He is the founder and chairman of Geopolitical Futures, an online publication that analyzes and forecasts the course of global events. Prior to founding Geopolitical Futures, he was chairman of its predecessor Stratfor, the private intelligence publishing and consulting firm he founded in 1996. Early life and education Friedman was born in Budapest, Hungary to Jewish parents who survived the Holocaust. His family fled Hungary when he was a child to escape the Communist regime as refugees, settling first in a camp for displaced persons in Austria and then emigrating to the United States. Friedman describes his family's story as \\"a very classic story of refugees making a new life in [North] America.\\" He received a B.A. at the City College of New York, where he majored in political science, and a Ph.D. in government at Cornell University.. Career Prior to joining the private sector, Friedman regularly briefed senior commanders in the armed services as well as the Office of Net Assessments, SHAPE Technical Center, the U.S. Army War College, National Defense University and the RAND Corporation, on security and national defense matters. Friedman pursued political philosophy with his early work focusing on Marxism, as well as international conflict, including examination of the Soviet-U.S. relationship from a military perspective. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he studied potential for a Japan-U.S. conflict and co-authored The Coming War with Japan in 1991. In 1996, Friedman founded Stratfor, a private intelligence and forecasting company, and served as the company's CEO and Chief Intelligence Officer. Stratfor's head office is in Austin, Texas. He resigned from Stratfor in May 2015. Friedman's reputation as a forecaster of geopolitical events led The New York Times magazine to comment, in a profile, \\"There is a temptation, when you are around George Friedman, to treat him like a Magic 8-Ball.\\" In The Next Decade, Friedman argues how the U.S. administrations of the 2010s will need to create regional power balances, some of which have been disturbed. Friedman conceptualizes successful U.S. management of world affairs not by directly enforcing countries, but by creating competing relationships, which offset one another, in the world's different regions. For example, in the past, Iraq balanced Iran, and currently Japan balances China. Friedman asserts this is the decade where the U.S. as a power must mature to manage its power and balance as an unintended empire and republic. Friedman's latest book, was released in 2020 by Doubleday. While originally scheduled to be released in January 2018, it was delayed six times before being released in 2020. The working title was The New American Century: Crisis, Endurance, and the Future of the United States, but has subsequently been changed to The Storm Before the Calm: America's Discord, the Coming Crisis of the 2020s, and the Triumph Beyond. Personal life Friedman is married to Meredith Friedman (n√©e LeBard), has four children, and lives in Austin, Texas.

History and archaeology =Neolithic= At Mikveh Cave archaeologists found Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) flint tools and an arrowhead. =Chalcolithic= A Chalcolithic temple (ca. mid-fourth millennium BCE) belonging to the Ghassulian culture was excavated on the slope between two springs, Ein Shulamit and Ein Gedi. More Chalcolithic finds were made at the Moringa and Mikveh Caves. =Bronze Age= No traces of Bronze Age settlement have been found at Ein Gedi. =Iron Age= The remains of the Iron Age settlement at Ein Gedi are located at a tell on the north bank of Wadi Arugot, known in Arabic as Tell el-Jurn and in Hebrew as Tel Goren. The first permanent Iron Age settlement was Judean and was established around 630 BCE. The site was destroyed or abandoned after the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem in 587/86 BCE. Hebrew Bible In , Ein Gedi is enumerated among the wilderness cities of the Tribe of Judah in the desert of Betharaba, and in , it is prophesied that one day, its coastal location will make it into a fishing village, after the water of the Dead Sea has been made sweet: :Fishing nets will be spread from En-gedi to En-eglaim.Jerusalem Bible: Ezekiel 47:10 Fleeing from King Saul, David hides in the strongholds at Ein Gedi ( and ) and Saul seeks him \\"even upon the most craggy rocks, which are accessible only to wild goats\\" (). Psalm 63, subtitled a Psalm of David when he was in the wilderness of Judah, has been associated with David's sojourn in the desert of En-gedi.Joseph Lightfoot, Works, vol. 1. p. 58, referenced by Gill, J. in Gill's Exposition of the Bible on 1 Samuel 23, accessed 24 May 2017 In Ein Gedi is identified with Hazazon-tamar,e.g. ASV, NRSV and CEB Hazezon Tamar,e.g. NKJV Hatzatzon-Tamar e.g. CJB or Hazezontamar (◊ó÷∑◊¶÷∞◊¶◊ï÷π◊ü ◊™÷∏÷º◊û÷∏◊® ·∏•a·π£·π£≈çn tƒÅmƒÅr, \\"portion [of land] of date palms\\"), on account of the palm groves which surrounded it,A Smaller Dictionary of The Bible, Sir William Smith, 1914, John Murrey, London. page 169. where the Moabites and Ammonites gathered in order to fight Josaphat, king of Judah. In Hazazon-tamar is mentioned as being an Amorite city, smitten by Chedorlaomer in his war against the cities of the plain. The Song of Songs () speaks of the \\"vineyards of En Gedi\\". The words of Ecclesiasticus 24:18, \\"I was exalted like a palm tree in Cades\\" (‚Äôen a√≠gialo√Æs), may perhaps be understood as the palm trees of Ein Gedi. =Persian period= The settlement at Tel Goren is a rare example of a town which reached its zenith during the Persian period, probably during the late 5th century BCE. =Hellenistic period= Ein Gedi receives a fortress and becomes a royal Hasmonean estate. =Herodian and Roman period= According to the Jewish-Roman historian Josephus Flavius, the Sicarii, who fought the Romans until their defeat and mass suicide at Masada, plundered local villages including En Gedi. At En Gedi, they drove out the defenders, and killed over seven hundred women and children who could not run away.The Wars of the Jews, or History of the Destruction of Jerusalem, by Flavius Josephus, translated by William Whiston, Project Gutenberg, Book IV, Chapter 7, Paragraph 2.Flavius Josephus, De bello Judaico libri vii, B.

Nature reserve and national park Two Nubian Ibexes at Ein Gedi nature reserve Ein Gedi nature reserve was declared in 1971 and is one of the most important reserves in Israel. The park is situated on the eastern border of the Judean Desert, on the Dead Sea coast, and covers an area of 14000 dunams ( or ). The elevation of the land ranges from the level of the Dead Sea at 423 meters (1,388 ft) below sea level to the plateau of the Judean Desert at 200 meters above sea level. Ein Gedi nature reserve includes two spring-fed streams with flowing water year-round: Nahal David and Nahal Arugot (German article at: :de:Nachal Arugot). Two other springs, the Shulamit and Ein Gedi springs, also flow in the reserve. Together, the springs generate approximately three million cubic meters of water per year. Much of the water is used for agriculture or is bottled for consumption. The reserve is a sanctuary for many types of plant, bird and animal species. The vegetation includes plants and trees from the tropical, desert, Mediterranean, and steppian regions, such as Sodom apple, acacia, jujube, and poplar. The many species of resident birds are supplemented by over 200 additional species during the migration periods in the spring and fall. Mammal species include the Nubian ibex and the rock hyrax. The Ein Gedi national park features several archaeological sites including the Chalcolithic Temple of Ein Gedi and a first-century CE village. The park was declared in 2002 and covers an area of 8 dunams ( or ). Kibbutz kibbutz Ein Gedi. Kibbutz Ein Gedi, founded in 1956, is located about a kilometer from the oasis. It offers various tourist attractions and takes advantage of the local weather patterns and the abundance of natural water to cultivate out-of-season produce. The kibbutz area contains an internationally acclaimed botanical garden covering an area of 100 dunams (10 ha, 24.7 acres). There one can find more than 900 species of plants from all over the world. The kibbutz is also home to the Ein Gedi Eco Park, which functions as both a zoo and an environmental education center, demonstrating sustainable technologies such as solar cookers, greywater systems, mud buildings, and compost toilets. Shalom Marathon ‚Äì Dead Sea Half Marathon The Ein Gedi race, also known as the Shalom Marathon ‚Äì Dead Sea Half Marathon is a popular road running event over several distances that has been held by the Tamar Regional Council since 1983. The starting point for all races is the Ein Gedi Spa, southeast of Jerusalem and 4 kilometers south of Kibbutz Ein Gedi.\\"Ein-Gedi Race\\" See also * Archaeology of Israel * Tourism in Israel * Wildlife of Israel * Hiking in Israel * En-Gedi Scroll References Bibliography * (pp. 384-386)  (Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 116) * * (pp. 143-150) External links * Virtual Tour of Ein Gedi - View from the Ein Gedi Promenade * Ein Gedi in the Dead Sea Map - Bird's-eye view in Flash * The Israel Nature and Parks Authority - Site page * Ein Gedi Travel Guide * Pictures of Ein Gedi synagogue * Ein Gedi mill, 1893 *Survey of Western Palestine, Map 22: IAA, Wikimedia commons Category:Nature reserves in Israel Category:National parks of Israel Category:Oases of Israel Category:Springs of Israel Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1972 Category:Botanical gardens in Israel Category:Protected areas of Southern District (Israel) Category:Tells (archaeology) Category:Canaanite cities Category:Ancient Jewish settlements of Judaea Category:Hebrew Bible places Category:Israeli mosaics Category:Dead Sea basin ","title":"Ein Gedi"},{"id":"1147410","text":"Satchel Ronan O'Sullivan Farrow (born December 19, 1987) is an American journalist. The son of actress Mia Farrow and filmmaker Woody Allen, he is known for his investigative reporting of allegations of sexual abuse against film producer Harvey Weinstein, which was published in the magazine The New Yorker. For this work, the magazine won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, sharing the award with The New York Times. Farrow's subsequent investigations exposed other allegations against politician Eric Schneiderman, media executive Les Moonves, and lawyer and jurist Brett Kavanaugh. He also makes regular appearances on the NBC morning program Today. Early life Farrow was born on December 19, 1987, in New York City to actress Mia Farrow and filmmaker Woody Allen. His father's family is Jewish, and his mother's family is Catholic. His given names honor National Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Satchel Paige and actress Maureen O'Sullivan, his maternal grandmother. Now known as Ronan, he was given the surname \\"Farrow\\" to avoid confusion in a family with one child named Allen amid Farrows and Previns. p.182 As a child, Farrow skipped grades in school and took courses with the Center for Talented Youth. He attended Bard College at Simon's Rock, later transferring to Bard College for a B.A. in philosophy, where he became the youngest graduate of that institution at age 15. In 2009, he received a J.D. from Yale Law School, and he later passed the New York State Bar examination.  Career  =Public service= From 2001 to 2009, he was a UNICEF Spokesperson for Youth, advocating for children and women caught up in the ongoing crisis in Sudan's Darfur region and assisting in fundraising and addressing United Nations affiliated groups in the United States. During this time, he also made joint trips to the Darfur region of Sudan with his mother, actress Mia Farrow, who is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. He subsequently advocated for the protection of Darfuri refugees. Following on his experiences in Sudan, Farrow was affiliated with the Genocide Intervention Network. During his time at Yale Law School, Farrow interned at the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell and in the office of the chief counsel at the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, focusing on international human rights law. In 2009, Farrow joined the Obama administration as Special Adviser for Humanitarian and NGO Affairs in the Office of the Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. He was part of a team of officials recruited by the diplomat Richard Holbrooke, for whom Farrow had previously worked as a speechwriter. For the next two years, Farrow was responsible for \\"overseeing the U.S. Government's relationships with civil society and nongovernmental actors\\" in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 2011, Farrow was appointed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as her Special Adviser for Global Youth Issues and Director of the State Department's Office of Global Youth Issues. The office's creation was the outcome of a multi-year task-force appointed by Clinton to review the United States' economic and social policies on youth, for which Farrow co-chaired the working group with senior United States Agency for International Development staff member David Barth beginning in 2010. Farrow's appointment and the creation of the office were announced by Clinton as part of a refocusing on youth following the Arab Spring revolutions. Farrow was responsible for U.S. youth policy and programming with an aim toward \\"empower[ing] young people as economic and civic actors.\\" Farrow concluded his term as Special Adviser in 2012, with his policies and programs continuing under his successor. =Journalism= Farrow in 2012. After leaving government, Farrow began a Rhodes Scholarship at Magdalen College, Oxford. He studied toward a PhD, researching the exploitation of the poor in developing countries and submitted his thesis in October 2018. He has written essays, op- eds, and other pieces for The Guardian, Foreign Policy magazine, The Atlantic, The Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times and other periodicals. In October 2013, Penguin Press acquired Farrow's book, Pandora's Box: How American Military Aid Creates America's Enemies, scheduling it for 2015 publication. From February 2014 through February 2015, Farrow hosted Ronan Farrow Daily, a television news program that aired on MSNBC. Farrow hosted the investigative segment \\"Undercover with Ronan Farrow\\" on NBC's Today. Launched in June 2015, the series was billed as providing Farrow's look at the stories \\"you don't see in the headlines every day\\", often featuring crowd-sourced story selection and covering topics from the labor rights of nail salon workers to mental healthcare issues to sexual assault on campus. On May 11, 2016, The Hollywood Reporter published a guest column by Farrow in which he drew comparisons between the long-term absence of journalistic inquiry into the rape allegations leveled against Bill Cosby and the sexual abuse allegations levied against Woody Allen by Farrow's sister, Dylan Farrow (who was 7 years old at the time of the alleged abuse). Farrow detailed first-hand accounts of journalists, biographers, and major publications purposefully omitting from their work decades of rape allegations targeting Cosby. Similarly, Farrow recounts the efforts of Allen's publicist, Leslee Dart, to mount a media campaign focused on countering Dylan Farrow's allegations, while at the same time vindicating Allen: > Every day, colleagues at news organizations forwarded me the emails blasted > out by Allen's powerful publicist, who had years earlier orchestrated a > robust publicity campaign to validate my father's sexual relationship with > another one of my siblings. Those emails featured talking points ready-made > to be converted into stories, complete with validators on offer‚Äîtherapists, > lawyers, friends, anyone willing to label a young woman confronting a > powerful man as crazy, coached, vindictive. At first, they linked to blogs, > then to high-profile outlets repeating the talking points‚Äîa self- > perpetuating spin machine. Farrow continues, by reiterating his support for Dylan Farrow and expressing his unwavering belief in her allegations: > I believe my sister. This was always true as a brother who trusted her and, > even at 5 years old, was troubled by our father's strange behavior around > her: climbing into her bed in the middle of the night, forcing her to suck > his thumb‚Äîbehavior that had prompted him to enter into therapy focused on > his inappropriate conduct with children prior to the allegations. In closing his guest column, Farrow expresses his view of media culture as one that actively discourages victims of abuse from coming forward. Farrow states that victims are pressured to remain silent by threat of \\"having those tough newsroom conversations, making the case for burning bridges with powerful public figures\\" as well as \\"going up against angry fans and angry publicists\\". Farrow's regard for Hollywood (and media in general), as represented in his 2016 The Hollywood Reporter guest column, foreshadows his investigation into the alleged misconduct of Harvey Weinstein which would be published the following year. On October 10, 2017, The New Yorker published an investigative article by Farrow detailing allegations of sexual misconduct against film producer Harvey Weinstein five days after The New York Times published the findings of its own investigation into Weinstein. It was subsequently revealed that Farrow originally worked on the story for NBC and that the network decided against airing his initial findings in 2016. The New Yorker won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for Farrow's reporting, sharing the award with Jodi Kantor and Meghan Twohey at The New York Times. Farrow was included in the Time \\"100 Most Influential People in the World\\" list in 2018. On May 7, 2018, The New Yorker published an article by Farrow and fellow reporter Jane Mayer stating that, during his term in office, the New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman had physically abused at least four women with whom he had been romantically involved, and that he had habitually abused alcohol and prescription drugs. Schneiderman resigned within hours of the publication of the article on the following day. Mayer and Farrow reported that they had confirmed the women's allegations with photographs of contusions and with statements from friends with whom the alleged victims had confided subsequent to the claimed assaults. Though he denied the allegations, Schneiderman stated that he resigned because they \\"effectively prevent me from leading the office's work\\". Governor Andrew Cuomo assigned a special prosecutor to investigate the filing of possible criminal charges against Schneiderman. On July 27, 2018, The New Yorker published an article by Farrow stating that six women had accused media executive and CBS CEO Leslie Moonves of harassment and intimidation, and that dozens more described abuse at his company.Ronan Farrow (July 27, 2018). Allegations of Sexual Misconduct. The New Yorker. (This article appears in the print edition of the August 6 & 13, 2018, issue, with the headline \\"Trouble at the Top\\".) On August 23, The New Yorker published an article by Adam Entous and Farrow stating that top aides of the Trump White House circulated a conspiracy memo entitled \\"The Echo Chamber\\" about Obama aides. On September 14, Farrow and Jane Mayer published information pertaining to an allegation of sexual assault by United States Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. The woman making the allegation was revealed to be professor Christine Blasey Ford, who would go on to testify against Kavanaugh before his successful confirmation. In early 2019, Farrow said he and another journalist received demands from American Media, Inc. that sought to extort or blackmail him. He also investigated the concealment by the MIT Media Lab of its involvement with Jeffrey Epstein, leading to the resignation of the director of the Media Lab, Joi Ito, and an internal investigation by MIT. =Film and television work= Farrow voiced minor characters in the English-language versions of two Japanese animated films, From Up on Poppy Hill (2011) and The Wind Rises (2013). He also guest starred as himself on the Netflix comedy series Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Farrow also made an appearance on the ABC talk show The View as a guest co-host on December 3, 2019. Recognition In 2008, Farrow was awarded Refugees International's McCall-Pierpaoli Humanitarian Award for \\"extraordinary service to refugees and displaced people\\". In 2009, Farrow was named New York magazine's \\"New Activist\\" of the year and included on its list of individuals \\"on the verge of changing their worlds\\". In 2011, Harper's Bazaar listed him as an \\"up-and-coming politician\\". In 2012, he was ranked number one in \\"Law and Policy\\" on Forbes magazine's \\"30 Under 30\\" Most Influential People. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate by Dominican University of California in 2012. In its 2013 retrospective of men born in its 80 years of publication, Esquire magazine named him the man of the year of his birth. In February 2014, Farrow received the third annual Cronkite Award for \\"Excellence in Exploration and Journalism\\" from Reach the World, in recognition of his work since 2001, including his being a UNICEF Spokesperson for Youth in 2001. Some media outlets noted that the award came three days after Ronan Farrow Daily began airing and suggested that the award was therefore not justified. Farrow is the recipient of the Stonewall Community Foundation's 2016 Vision Award for his reporting on transgender issues. He was also recognized by the Point Foundation in 2018, receiving the Point Courage Award for his in-depth reporting on #MeToo. In July 2018, Farrow won the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association‚Äôs Journalist of the Year award. In 2019, he was listed among the 40 Under 40 List put out by Connecticut Magazine.\\"40 Under 40: The Class of 2019.\\" (Connecticut Magazine) (January 23, 2019) Retrieved March 5, 2019. He was also named the Out100 Journalist of the Year. On May 17, 2020, New York Times reporter Ben Smith published an article titled \\"Is Ronan Farrow Too Good to Be True?\\", asserting that some of Farrow's journalism did not hold up to scrutiny. In response, Farrow said that he stood by his reporting. Personal life As of August 2019, Farrow resided on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. He publicly identified as part of the LGBT community in 2018. Farrow began dating podcast host and former presidential speech writer Jon Lovett in 2011. The two became engaged in 2019 after Farrow wrote a proposal to Lovett in the draft for his book Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators. The couple bought a $1.87 million home in Los Angeles in August 2019. =Relationship to Woody Allen and paternity= Farrow is estranged from his father, Woody Allen. After Allen married Soon-Yi Previn, the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow and Andr√© Previn, Farrow commented, \\"He's my father married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression.\\" In a 2013 interview with Vanity Fair, Mia Farrow stated that Ronan could \\"possibly\\" be the biological child of singer Frank Sinatra, with whom she said she \\"never really split up.\\" Ronan Farrow tweeted, \\"Listen, we're all *possibly* Frank Sinatra's son.\\" In a 2015 CBS Sunday Morning interview, Sinatra's daughter Nancy dismissed the idea that her father is the biological father of Ronan Farrow, calling it \\"nonsense\\", and said her father had a vasectomy years before Ronan's birth.Ronan Farrow Is Frank Sinatra's Son? Nancy Sinatra Says That's 'Nonsense'. Billboard. April 2, 2015. Farrow has refused to discuss DNA, and stated that despite their estrangement, \\"Woody Allen, legally, ethically, personally was absolutely a father in our family.\\" In a 2018 New York magazine article, Woody Allen said that Farrow may indeed be Sinatra's son: \\"In my opinion, he's my child ‚Ä¶ I think he is, but I wouldn't bet my life on it.

It was created in 1949 as the Canadian subsidiary of the Electro Motive Division of General Motors (EMD) located in the United States. In 1969 it was re-organized as the Diesel Division of General Motors of Canada, Ltd. The plant was re-purposed to include manufacture of other diesel-powered General Motors vehicles such as buses. Following the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement in 1989, all of EMD's locomotives were built at the London facility. In 2005 new owners of EMD renamed the Canadian subsidiary Electro-Motive Canada. The plant was closed by EMD's new owner Progress Rail Services in 2012, with EMD's production remaining in LaGrange, Illinois and Muncie, Indiana. History =Early diesel locomotive manufacturing in Canada= Diesel-electric locomotives were built in Canada beginning in 1928. The earliest diesels were custom built one-of-a-kind designs such as Canadian National Railways numbers 9000 and 9001 and Canadian Pacific Railway number 7000. After these unique locomotives, steam remained in favor for road service owing to the higher initial costs and lower reliability of early diesel locomotives. The benefit of diesels was largely their reduced operating costs compared to steam, but they had to be kept going to pay for themselves. Increased utilization was key to their cost benefits. The greatest savings were to be had in yard service, where switching often meant idling that maximized the efficiency advantages of diesel over steam. Through the 1930s into the 1940s the largest market for diesel-electric locomotives was for switchers such as the ALCO S-2 and the EMD NW2. Tariffs protected Canadian manufacturers against imported goods, thus many companies wanting to do business in Canada set up controlled or wholly owned subsidiaries in Canada. General Motors Diesel, Ltd., was EMD's subsidiary organized for that purpose. Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) in Montreal, Quebec served a similar purpose for the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) and the Canadian Locomotive Company (CLC) in Kingston, Ontario served a similar purpose for Baldwin Locomotive Works. MLW and CLC also produced steam and diesel engines of their own designs. The growing market for diesels in Canada meant it became worthwhile to build facilities in Canada to avoid import duties. While MLW and CLC both utilized existing steam locomotive erecting shops in Montreal and Kingston, respectively; General Motors, never having built steam locomotives, required a new facility. =GMD operations= General Motors Diesel selected a site on the outskirts of London, Ontario, for this plant. It opened in 1950, eventually expanding several times to 208 acres (842,000 m2) and branching out into building transit buses, earth movers (Terex 1965-1980) and military vehicles built at adjacent facilities. Originally designed to produce one unit per day, it was some time before that volume of orders were received. It was later expanded to one and one half units per day. La Grange, as the US plant was referred to, eventually could produce six units per day. The first diesel locomotive built was Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway (TH&B;) number 71, one of four model GP7 1,500 hp (1100 kW) road switchers. It was however, not the first order (C-100) received, which was from Canadian Pacific for ten model FP7A 1,500 hp (1100 kW) A units of the \\"covered wagon\\" style of carbody. The two orders were on the shop floor under construction at the same time and it was TH&B; 71 which was completed first and delivered on August 25 along with 72. Pairs of A units were delivered commencing with CP numbers 4028 and 4029 on September 14 and continuing until November 11. TH&B; 71 cost $191,712 at the time. For comparison, Alco 1,000 hp (750 kW) yard switchers built in Schenectady, New York cost $115,000 including import duty. GMD built units for export, a significant amount of business supported by government grants to foreign countries. GMD also built some experimental diesel-hydraulic locomotives and straight electric units as well, although neither were more than a tiny percentage of production. General Motors Diesel Ltd. became the Diesel Division of General Motors of Canada Ltd. on February 1, 1969, in a consolidation of all Canadian properties. Once dominant in North American diesel locomotive production having seen Baldwin, Fairbanks-Morse, Lima, Hamilton, Alco, MLW and CLC all fall by the wayside, General Motors fell under intense competition from General Electric (GE). During the 1950s GE expanded beyond its early production of small locomotives, much of it for small and medium size industries, into large mainline road locomotives for Class I railroads. With excess capacity at the London operation following the peak demand years of the 1950s, GMC Truck and Coach Division used it for production of heavy road vehicles such as buses. The plant was also used for production of construction equipment and light armored vehicles under contract. EMD moved all locomotive construction to London in 1991, after which the London plant supplied US customers under the Free Trade agreement between Canada and the United States. Some primary equipment manufacturing, such as engines generators, and traction motors, remained in EMD's LaGrange, Illinois facility. =Ownership changes= On April 4, 2005, GM sold its EMD subsidiary with its London and LaGrange operations to a partnership between Greenbriar Equity Group LLC and Berkshire Partners LLC. The company was renamed Electro- Motive Diesel, Inc, thus retaining the EMD initials. EMD's Canadian subsidiary was renamed Electro-Motive Canada. In 2010 EMD and its Canadian subsidiary were acquired by Caterpillar, Inc.'s subsidiary Progress Rail Services. =The end= The plant was closed in 2012, after a labor dispute and construction of a new plant in Muncie, Indiana.https://lfpress.com/2015/07/14/electro-motive- era-finally-ends Clients * BC Rail * BNSF Railway * Canadian National Railway * Canadian Pacific Railway * CSX * Direct Rail Services * ERS * EWS * Fastline * Freightliner * GB Railfreight * GO Transit * New Zealand Government Railways * NMBS * Norfolk Southern * Sri Lanka Railways * Union Pacific * Via Rail See also * General Motors Diesel Division * List of GMD Locomotives References External links * History of General Motors Diesel (Archive) GMD Category:Locomotive manufacturers of Canada Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of Canada Category:General Motors subsidiaries Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1949 Category:1949 establishments in Canada ","title":"General Motors Diesel"},{"id":"1147421","text":"A funeral march (Marche fun√®bre in French, Marcia funebre in Italian, Trauermarsch in German), as a musical genre, is a march, usually in a minor key, in a slow \\"simple duple\\" metre, imitating the solemn pace of a funeral procession.

Some common types of table are the dining room table, which is used for seated persons to eat meals; the coffee table, which is a low table used in living rooms to display items or serve refreshments; and the bedside table, which is used to place an alarm clock and a lamp. There are also a range of specialized types of tables, such as drafting tables, used for doing architectural drawings, and sewing tables. Common design elements include: * top surfaces of various shapes, including rectangular, square, rounded, semi-circular or oval * legs arranged in two or more similar pairs. It usually has four legs. However, some tables have three legs, use a single heavy pedestal, or are attached to a wall. * several geometries of folding table that can be collapsed into a smaller volume (e.g., a TV tray, which is a portable, folding table on a stand) * heights ranging up and down from the most common range, often reflecting the height of chairs or bar stools used as seating for people making use of a table, as for eating or performing various manipulations of objects resting on a table * a huge range of sizes, from small bedside tables to large dining room tables and huge conference room tables * presence or absence of drawers, shelves or other areas for storing items * expansion of the table surface by insertion of leaves or locking hinged drop leaf sections into a horizontal position (this is particularly common for dining tables) Etymology The word table is derived from Old English tabele, derived from the Latin word tabula (\\"a board, plank, flat top piece\\"), which replaced OE bord Etymonline; its current spelling reflects the influence of the French table. History Roman dining table: mensa lunata Large 17th-century English folding tables Some very early tables were made and used by the Ancient Egyptians around 2500 BC, using wood and alabaster. They were often little more than stone platforms used to keep objects off the floor, though a few examples of wooden tables have been found in tombs. Food and drinks were usually put on large plates deposed on a pedestal for eating. The Egyptians made use of various small tables and elevated playing boards. The Chinese also created very early tables in order to pursue the arts of writing and painting, as did people in Mesopotamia, where various metals were used. The Greeks and Romans made more frequent use of tables, notably for eating, although Greek tables were pushed under a bed after use. The Greeks invented a piece of furniture very similar to the gu√©ridon. Tables were made of marble or wood and metal (typically bronze or silver alloys), sometimes with richly ornate legs. Later, the larger rectangular tables were made of separate platforms and pillars. The Romans also introduced a large, semicircular table to Italy, the mensa lunata. Furniture during the Middle Ages is not as well known as that of earlier or later periods, and most sources show the types used by the nobility. In the Eastern Roman Empire, tables were made of metal or wood, usually with four feet and frequently linked by x-shaped stretchers. Tables for eating were large and often round or semicircular. A combination of a small round table and a lectern seemed very popular as a writing table.Heyward, p20 In western Europe, the invasions and internecine wars caused most of the knowledge inherited from the classical era to be lost. As a result of the necessary movability, most tables were simple trestle tables, although small round tables made from joinery reappeared during the 15th century and onward. In the Gothic era, the chest became widespread and was often used as a table. Refectory tables first appeared at least as early as the 17th century, as an advancement of the trestle table; these tables were typically quite long and wide and capable of supporting a sizeable banquet in the great hall or other reception room of a castle. Shape, height, and function Tables come in a wide variety of materials, shapes, and heights dependent upon their origin, style, intended use and cost. Many tables are made of wood or wood-based products; some are made of other materials including metal and glass. Most tables are composed of a flat surface and one or more supports (legs). A table with a single, central foot is a pedestal table. Long tables often have extra legs for support.Dinner table and chairs Table tops can be in virtually any shape, although rectangular, square, round (e.g. the round table), and oval tops are the most frequent. Others have higher surfaces for personal use while either standing or sitting on a tall stool. Many tables have tops that can be adjusted to change their height, position, shape, or size, either with foldable, sliding or extensions parts that can alter the shape of the top. Some tables are entirely foldable for easy transportation, e.g. camping or storage, e.g., TV trays. Small tables in trains and aircraft may be fixed or foldable, although they are sometimes considered as simply convenient shelves rather than tables. Tables can be freestanding or designed for placement against a wall. Tables designed to be placed against a wall are known as Pier tables or s (, \\"support bracket\\") and may be bracket-mounted (traditionally), like a shelf, or have legs, which sometimes imitate the look of a bracket- mounted table. Types A combination of a table with two benches (picnic table) as often seen at camping sites and other outdoor facilities A formally laid table, set with a dinner service Tables of various shapes, heights, and sizes are designed for specific uses: *Dining room tables are designed to be used for formal dining. *Bedside tables, nightstands, or night tables are small tables used in a bedroom. They are often used for convenient placement of a small lamp, alarm clock, glasses, or other personal items. *Gateleg tables have one or two hinged leaves supported by hinged legs. *Coffee tables are low tables designed for use in a living room, in front of a sofa, for convenient placement of drinks, books, or other personal items. *Refectory tables are long tables designed to seat many people for meals. *Drafting tables usually have a top that can be tilted for making a large or technical drawing. They may also have a ruler or similar element integrated. *Workbenches are sturdy tables, often elevated for use with a high stool or while standing, which are used for assembly, repairs, or other precision handwork. *Nested tables are a set of small tables of graduated size that can be stacked together, each fitting within the one immediately larger. They are for occasional use (such as a tea party), hence the stackable design. Specialized types Historically, various types of tables have been popular for other uses: *Loo tables were very popular in the 18th and 19th centuries as candlestands, tea tables, or small dining tables, although they were originally made for the popular card game called loo or lanterloo. Their typically round or oval tops have a tilting mechanism, which enables them to be stored out of the way (e.g. in room corners) when not in use. A further development in this direction was the \\"birdcage\\" table, the top of which could both revolve and tilt. Chess table *Pembroke tables were first introduced during the 18th century and were popular throughout the 19th century. Their main characteristic was a rectangular or oval top with folding or drop leaves on each side. Most examples have one or more drawers and four legs sometimes connected by stretchers. Their design meant they could easily be stored or moved about and conveniently opened for serving tea, dining, writing, or other occasional uses.Competitive table tennis *Sofa tables are similar to Pembroke tables and usually have longer and narrower tops. They were specifically designed for placement directly in front of sofas for serving tea, writing, dining, or other convenient uses. Generally speaking, a sofa table is a tall, narrow table used behind a sofa to hold lamps or decorative objects. *Work tables were small tables designed to hold sewing materials and implements, providing a convenient work place for women who sewed. They appeared during the 18th century and were popular throughout the 19th century. Most examples have rectangular tops, sometimes with folding leaves, and usually one or more drawers fitted with partitions. Early examples typically have four legs, often standing on casters, while later examples sometimes have turned columns or other forms of support.Poker table *Drum tables are round tables introduced for writing, with drawers around the platform. *End tables are small tables typically placed beside couches or armchairs. Often lamps will be placed on an end table. *Overbed tables are narrow rectangular tables whose top is designed for use above the bed, especially for hospital patients.n. overbed table. Merriam-Webster.. Retrieved 2020-10-20 *Billiards tables are bounded tables on which billiards-type games are played. All provide a flat surface, usually composed of slate and covered with cloth, elevated above the ground. *Chess tables are a type of games table that integrates a chessboard. *Table tennis tables are usually masonite or a similar wood, layered with a smooth low- friction coating. they are divided into two halves by a low net, which separates opposing players. *Poker tables or card tables are used to play poker or other card games.

She is known to many as the \\"Queen of Rockabilly\\" or the \\"First Lady of Rockabilly\\".Jurgensen, John. \\"The Queen of Rockabilly Returns\\". Wall Street Journal, January 21, 2011. p. D8. Jackson mixed country music with fast-moving rockabilly, often recording them on opposite sides of a record. As rockabilly declined in popularity in the 1960s, she moved to a successful career in mainstream country music with a string of hits between 1961 and 1973, including \\"Right or Wrong\\", \\"Tears Will Be the Chaser for Your Wine\\", \\"A Woman Lives for Love\\" and \\"Fancy Satin Pillows\\". She had a resurgence in popularity in the 1980s among rockabilly revivalists in Europe and younger Americana fans. In 2009, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the category Early Influence. On March 27, 2019, Jackson announced her official retirement from performing. Early life Jackson was born to Tom Robert Jackson (March 24, 1915 ‚Äì October 1985) and Nellie Vera Jackson (December 19, 1913 ‚Äì January 14, 2011) in Maud, Oklahoma, in 1937. She has lived much of her life in Oklahoma City. Her father, a musician, moved the family to Bakersfield, California, during the 1940s in hopes of a better life. Two years later, he bought Jackson a guitar and encouraged her to play. He also took her to see performances by Spade Cooley, Tex Williams and Bob Wills, which left a lasting impression. In 1948, when she was 11, the family moved back to Oklahoma. In 1956, she won a talent contest which led to her own radio program, soon extended by 30 minutes. Jackson began her professional career while still attending Capitol Hill High School in Oklahoma City after being discovered by Hank Thompson in 1954, who heard her singing on a local radio station, KLPR-AM, and invited her to perform with his band, the Brazos Valley Boys. She recorded a few songs on their label, Capitol Records, including \\"You Can't Have My Love\\", a duet with Thompson's bandleader, Billy Gray. The song was released as a single in 1954 and reached number 8 on the country chart. Jackson asked Capitol to sign her but was turned down by producer Ken Nelson, who told her, \\"Girls don't sell records.\\" She signed with Decca Records instead. Career =1955‚Äì1959= After graduating from high school, Jackson began to tour with her father as manager and chaperon. She often shared the bill with Elvis Presley, who encouraged her to sing rockabilly. She briefly dated Presley while touring. She was a cast member of ABC-TV's Ozark Jubilee in Springfield, Missouri, from 1955 to 1960. In 1956 she signed with Capitol, recording a number of singles mixing country with rock and roll. \\"I Gotta Know\\", released in 1956, peaked at number 15. Jackson's stage outfits in these years were often designed by her mother. Unlike the traditional clothing worn by female country music singers of the time, she wore fringed dresses, high heels and long earrings. She has claimed she was the first woman to put \\"glamour into country music.\\" She continued to record more rockabilly singles through the decade with the producer Ken Nelson. Jackson insisted that Nelson make her records sound like those of label mates Gene Vincent and the Blue Caps. Nelson brought in many experienced and popular session players, including the rock-and-roll pianist Merill Moore and the then-unknown Buck Owens. With a unique vocal style and upbeat material, Jackson created some of the most influential rock and roll of the time. In the late 1950s, Jackson recorded and released a number of rockabilly songs, including \\"Hot Dog! That Made Him Mad\\", \\"Mean, Mean Man\\", \\"Fujiyama Mama\\" (which hit number 1 in Japan) and \\"Honey Bop\\". The songs were only regional hits. She toured Japan in February and March 1959. =1960‚Äì1964: The Queen of Rockabilly= In 1960, Jackson had a Top 40 pop hit with \\"Let's Have a Party\\", a song Presley had recorded three years earlier. She was headlining concerts with her own band, which she dubbed the Party Timers. Prominently featured were the pianist Big Al Downing and the guitarist Roy Clark, who was virtually unknown at the time. Her country music career also began to take off with the self-penned \\"Right or Wrong\\", a number 9 hit, and \\"In the Middle of a Heartache\\", which peaked at number 6\\\\. Both records also had Top 40 success. The unexpected success of her records led Capitol to release a number of albums composed of her 1950s material, including Rockin' with Wanda (1960) and There's a Party Goin' On, which included \\"Tongue Tied\\" and \\"Hard-Headed Woman\\". Her 1961 and 1962 albums, Right or Wrong and Wonderful Wanda, featured her two top-ten country hits from 1961. In 1963, Jackson recorded another album, Two Sides of Wanda, which included both rock and roll and country music, including a cover of Jerry Lee Lewis's \\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\\". The album earned Jackson her first Grammy nomination, for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. =1965‚Äì1979: Country, gospel, and foreign language hits= By 1965, Jackson was focusing more exclusively on traditional country music as rockabilly declined in popularity, and had a string of Top 40 hits during the next ten years. In 1966, she released two singles that peaked in the country top 20, \\"Tears Will Be the Chaser for Your Wine\\" and \\"The Box It Came In\\". In early 1965, Jackson was invited by the German distribution partner of Capitol Records, Electrola, to record in German. Jackson's German-language debut single, \\"Santo Domingo\\" (backed with \\"Morgen, ja morgen\\"), recorded at Electrola's studios in Cologne, peaked at number 5 on the official German charts and at number 1 on the charts of Germany's most influential teen magazine, Bravo. In the first months following the chart success of Santo Domingo, Jackson also re-recorded some of her German songs in Dutch and Japanese. The success of Santo Domingo prompted the recording of eight further German-language singles until 1968, which were also released on an album, Made in Germany. Her last German single was recorded in 1970. In 1967, she recorded two albums, and released a string of singles during the next few years that often asserted a fiery and violent persona, including 1969's \\"My Big Iron Skillet\\", a top 20 hit, which threatened death or assault for cheating on a spouse. In 1970 and 1971, she had her final top 20 country hits with \\"A Woman Lives for Love\\" (her second Grammy nomination) and \\"Fancy Satin Pillows\\". Jackson was a premier attraction in Las Vegas. She followed Kitty Wells's lead as only the second country female vocalist to have her own syndicated television show, Music Village, from 1967 to 1968. In the early 1970s, at her children's request, Jackson and her husband began to regularly attend church and became Christians. She began recording gospel songs and albums, including Praise the Lord for Capitol in 1972. After Capitol dropped her, she recorded a number of albums for small religious labels and set up evangelical church tours across the country with her husband. Jackson wanted to record a mix of country and gospel music for her albums; however, religious labels were not interested. =1980‚Äì1999: Return to rockabilly= In the early 1980s, Jackson was invited to Europe to play and record rockabilly material when revivalists sought her out. She regularly toured Scandinavia, England, and Germany during the decade. Now embracing her rock-and-roll history, Jackson released the album Rockabilly Fever in 1984 (later issued by Rounder Records as Rock N' Roll Your Blues Away in 1986), her first secular album in a decade and her first recording of rock music in over twenty years. Cyndi Lauper acknowledged Jackson's classic rockabilly records were a major influence and inspiration for her during this period, and Jackson's fans also included a new generation of country music female vocalists, among them Rosanne Cash, Pam Tillis, Jann Browne and Rosie Flores. Jackson recorded a duet with Browne on a 1987 album by Browne, and in 1995 she sang two duets with Flores on her 1995 album, Rockabilly Filly, and then embarked on a United States tour with her, her first American tour since the 1970s. =2000‚Äìpresent= She played at the Rockabilly Festival in Jackson, Tennessee, in 2001 with The Cadillac Angels. Jackson, then in her early 60s, continued touring. She again played Jackson's International Rockabilly Hall of Fame show in August 2013, a show which also featured new inductee Terry Manning. Jackson released her first studio album since 1987, Heart Trouble (2003) on CMH Records. The sixteen-track album included guest appearances by Elvis Costello, the Cramps and Rosie Flores. The singer Amy LaVere portrayed a young Jackson in the Johnny Cash biopic, Walk the Line (2005). Jackson was interviewed about the origins of rockabilly in the award-winning Canadian documentary Rockabilly 514 (2008), directed by Patricia Chica and Mike Wafer. She returned to England on October 28, 2008, for an appearance at the London Rock 'n' Roll Festival with Jerry Lee Lewis and Linda Gail Lewis at the London Forum. In 2009, she teamed up with Jack White to record The Party Ain't Over. The album, released in 2011, marked Jackson's first charting on the Billboard Hot 200 LP chart, peaking at number 58. The album also broke Mae West's long-standing record for being the oldest female vocalist to make the chart with her 1966 album Way Out West. Jackson was 73, being a year older than West, at the time. To promote The Party Ain't Over, she performed with White on both the Late Show with David Letterman and Conan. Wanda's song \\"Funnel of Love\\" appeared in Guy Ritchie's film RocknRolla in 2008 and was included on the film's soundtrack. An episode of the HBO program Entourage in 2010 featured the same song as the music to the ending credits. Jackson appeared on the BBC's Hootenanny at the end of 2010, performing her version of \\"Let's Have a Party\\" and a cover of the Amy Winehouse song \\"You Know I'm No Good\\" with Jools Holland and his orchestra. The following year, after Winehouse's death, she took part in an Amy Winehouse tribute performance with Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings at the VH1 Divas Live 2011. Jackson released her thirty-first studio album Unfinished Business in 2012 for Sugar Hill Records. The album goes back to her rockabilly and country roots and was produced by Americana singer-songwriter Justin Townes Earle. The album became Jackson's first in 39 years to make the Billboard Hot Country LP chart. Following the announcement of her retirement, Jackson revealed in an interview with Rolling Stone that a previously undisclosed stroke that occurred in August 2018 was partially to blame for the decision. She did, however, reiterate that she is in the process of recording a new album produced by Joan Jett which she hopes to complete in 2019. Personal life In 1955, Jackson briefly dated Elvis Presley while on tour with him. She married former IBM programmer Wendell Goodman in 1961, who served as her manager. He died on May 21, 2017. The couple had two children. As of the 2000s she lives in Oklahoma City. Awards and recognition At the 7th Annual Grammy Awards in 1964, Jackson was nominated in the category of Best Country & Western Vocal Performance ‚Äì Female for her album Two Sides of Wanda. At the 13th Annual Grammy Awards in 1970, she was nominated in the Best Country Vocal Performance, Female category for the song \\"A Woman Lives for Love\\". Jackson is a member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, The International Rockabilly Hall of Fame, and the Oklahoma Music and Oklahoma Country Music halls of fame, as well as the International Gospel and the German Music halls of fame. Jackson ranked number 35 on CMT's 2002 special, \\"The 40 Greatest Women of Country Music\\". She is a recipient of a 2005 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States' highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. She was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005 but was not elected. In September 2008, she was nominated for a second time; and was inducted on April 4, 2009 as an Early Influence. She was the first addition to the category in nine years. In 2006 Alfred Publishing acknowledged her influence on young musicians by publishing The Best of Wanda Jackson: Let's Have a Party, a songbook with music and lyrics to thirteen songs associated with Jackson. It was the first songbook ever published on Jackson. In 2009, Oklahoma City named an alley for her in the Bricktown entertainment district. \\"Wanda Jackson Way\\" was officially christened with a live performance by Jackson in her \\"Way\\" on September 30, 2009. Besides this street in Oklahoma City, the city of Maud, Oklahoma, where she was born, has named one of its streets, Wanda Jackson Boulevard. On September 9, 2010, she was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award for Performance at the Americana Music Honors & Awards by Jack White on behalf of the Americana Music Association. In 2013, she was inducted into the Iowa Rock and Roll Music Association (IRRMA) Hall of Fame in the category \\"Women Who Rock\\". In 2016, Jackson received the \\"Founder of the Sound\\" award at the Ameripolitan Music Awards. Covers In 1964, Ronnie Dove took Wanda's \\"Right or Wrong\\" to No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100. Haruomi Hosono on his 1978 album Paraiso covered the song \\"Fujiyama Mama.\\" Jackson's \\"Funnel of Love\\" is a popular song amongst rock bands, being covered by the English rock band the Fall on their 2010 album Your Future Our Clutter, by the band The Young Veins for their 2010 album Take a Vacation! as a bonus MP3 track when bought on Amazon.com, by Social Distortion lead singer Mike Ness on his 1999 album Under the Influences, by the Welsh psychobilly band Demented Are Go on their 1999 album Hellucifernation, by American indie folk band Mutual Benefit on the compilation album Mad Love in Crazy Times, as well as by Southern Culture on the Skids on the 2007 album Countrypolitan Favorites. It was later recorded by Cyndi Lauper on her 2016 classic country covers album Detour. Discography Bibliography Jackson's autobiography titled Every Night is Saturday Night: A Country Girl's Journey to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was published on November 14, 2017.

There are four sizes of rackett, in a family ranging from descant (soprano), tenor-alto, bass to great bass. Relative to their pitch, racketts are quite small (the descant rackett is only 4¬Ω inches long, yet its lowest note is G2. This is achieved through its ingenious construction; the body consists of a solid wooden cylinder into which nine parallel bores are drilled. These are connected alternately at the top and bottom, resulting in a long, cylindrical wind passage within a compact body so that one can carry in one's pocket an instrument that will descend as low in pitch as a modern bassoon. Rackett: outside (left) and inside (right) However, its unusual construction requires its fingering to be somewhat different from other period woodwinds; it is similar to the front seven holes of the crumhorn and blends well with recorders and krumhorns, but with the hands placed side by side. Additional holes are covered by the thumbs and second joint of the index finger in order to extend the range a perfect fourth below the nominal scale, like the curtal. Thus the descant rackett is considered to be in C, but its range covers a perfect twelfth from d' to G. The ranges for the rest of the family as given by Praetorius are: tenor alt: g to C; bass: c to FF; great bass: A to DD or G to CC. The range could be extended upward by several more notes since the renaissance rackett overblows at the twelfth like a clarinet. Praetorius writes in Syntagma Musicum II: \\"if a rackett is well drilled and is played by a good musician, it then can be made to produce a few more tones.\\" The three extant renaissance racketts are housed in two European collections; one is in the Musikinstrumenten Museum in Leipzig, and two are in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The baroque rackett (developed by the Nuremberg maker J. C. Denner, 1655‚Äì1707) combined the folded bore concept with a conical (or pseudo-conical) bore profile; in essence, it is a bassoon in rackett form. It has ten parallel cylindrical bores whose diameters increase in succession to function as a true conical bore and allow overblowing at the octave. A number of tetines were added, which are tubular metal extensions covered by the middle joint of the index fingers as well as the pinkies. Condensation usually remains in the coil of the removable brass crook, thus it is fairly simple to expel during pauses. Despite its idiosyncrasies, the baroque rackett is a versatile instrument with a wide range of notes and dynamics. With an appropriate reed, the baroque rackett has a similar chromatic range to the baroque bassoon (g' to BB), and with its agility, can perform most bass-instrument repertoire from the time in which it was in vogue. Extant specimens of the baroque rackett can be found in the Musikinstrumenten-Museum Berlin and the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum in Munich.  Origin  Reproduction of a baroque rackett, manufactured by Moeck Musikinstrumente + Verlag The inventor of the rackett is unknown. The first historical mention can be found in German sources Wurttemberg inventories of 1576 (listed as a Raggett) and the Graz inventory of 1590 (listed as Rogetten).Sybil Marcuse, Musical Instruments: A Comprehensive Dictionary (New York 1964), p. 433 Early paintings of the Munich Court band and a carved cabinet by Christof Angermair depict a single rackett being played in a mixed consort of other instruments. Prior to the late seventeenth century, the rackett had a cylindrical bore and the reed was surrounded by a pirouette. The later baroque rackett had an expanding pseudo-conical bore and was blown through a coiled crook inserted into the top of the instrument. A separate bell joint is added to extend the sounding length.  Sound  Praetorius noted: \\"In sound Renaissance racketts are quite soft, almost as if one were blowing through a comb. They have no particular distinction when a whole set of them is used together, but when violas da gamba are used with them, or when a single rackett is used together with other wind or stringed instruments and a harpsichord or the like, and is played by a good musician, it is indeed a lovely instrument. It is particularly pleasing and fine to hear on bass parts.\\"Syntagma Musicum II. De Organographia (Wolfenb√ºttel 1619), 40 The baroque rackett, sometimes called a \\"pocket bassoon\\" or \\"sausage bassoon\\", conversely, sounds much like a dulcian or baroque bassoon, and can easily blend with the same kind of ensemble instruments‚Äîviolas da gamba, cornetti, historical keyboards, baroque recorders and small baroque orchestras.

It is widely considered to be one of his most obscure works and has led to many conflicting interpretations.Oxford Anthology of Literature of Renaissance England, J. Holander, F. Kermode (eds), OUP, 1973, p. 424. It has also been called \\"the first great published metaphysical poem\\".James P. Bednarz in Cheney, Patrick Gerard The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare's Poetry, Cambridge University Press, 2007, p117 The title \\"The Phoenix and the Turtle\\" is a conventional label. As published, the poem was untitled. The \\"turtle\\" is the turtle dove, not the shelled reptile. The poem describes a funeral arranged for the deceased Phoenix and Turtledove, respectively emblems of perfection and of devoted love. Some birds are invited, but others excluded. It goes on to state that the love of the birds created a perfect unity which transcended all logic and material fact. It concludes with a prayer for the dead lovers. Context A dying-and-reborn phoenix, depicted in the Aberdeen Bestiary It was first published in 1601 as a supplement to a long poem by Robert Chester, entitled Love's Martyr. The full title of Chester's book explains the content: :Love's Martyr: or Rosalins Complaint. Allegorically shadowing the truth of Loue, in the constant Fate of the Phoenix and Turtle. A Poeme enterlaced with much varietie and raritie; now first translated out of the venerable Italian Torquato Caeliano, by Robert Chester. With the true legend of famous King Arthur the last of the nine Worthies, being the first Essay of a new Brytish Poet: collected out of diuerse Authenticall Records. To these are added some new compositions of seuerall moderne Writers whose names are subscribed to their seuerall workes, vpon the first subiect viz. the Phoenix and Turtle. Chester prefaced his poem with a short dedication addressed to the Phoenix and Turtledove. The Phoenix is envisaged as female and the dove as male: :Phoenix of beautie, beauteous, Bird of any :To thee I do entitle all my labour, :More precious in mine eye by far then many :That feedst all earthly sences with thy savour: :Accept my home-writ praises of thy love, :And kind acceptance of thy Turtle-dove Chester's main poem is a long allegory in which the relationship between the birds is explored, and its symbolism articulated. It incorporates the story of King Arthur, and a history of ancient Britain, emphasising Welsh etymologies for British towns. It culminates with the joint immolation of the Phoenix and Turtledove, giving birth to a new and more beautiful bird from the ashes. It also includes several allegorical love poems within it, supposed to have been written by the Turtledove to the Phoenix. It is followed by a brief collection of \\"Diverse Poeticall Essaies\\" by the \\"best and chiefest of our moderne writers, with their names sub-scribed to their particular workes\\". These include, in addition to Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, George Chapman, John Marston and the anonymous \\"Vatum Chorus\\" and \\"Ignoto\\". All use the same imagery. The poems are introduced by Vatum Chorus and Ignoto, followed by The Phoenix and the Turtle, which ends with mourning for the death of the perfect lovers, \\"leaving no posterity\\". Marston then seems to reply to Shakespeare's \\"moving epicedium\\", by referring to the couple's \\"glorious issue\\": the being born from the flames. Chapman adds more detail on the relationship, saying that the Phoenix provided every variety of life to the Turtle, \\"She was to him the Analysed World of pleasure, / Her firmness cloth'd him in variety\\". Jonson ends with an idealisation of the Phoenix, whose judgement shines as \\"Clear as a naked Vestal, / Closed in an orb of Crystal.\\"  Interpretations  The Phoenix portrait of Queen Elizabeth, in which she wears her personal badge of the phoenix. In addition to an allegory of an ideal marriage, the poem can be seen as an elucidation of the relationship between truth and beauty, or of fulfilled love, in the context of Renaissance Neoplatonism.Zezmer, D.M., Guide to Shakespeare, 1976, New York, p. 88 It also seems that the roots of this conception of perfect love lie not only in scholastic sources regarding the union of persons in the Trinity, but also in the confluence of three other lines of medieval Catholic tradition: the literary traditions of mystical union, spiritual friendship, and spiritual marriage Shakespeare introduces a number of other birds, drawing on earlier literature about the \\"parliament of birds\\", to portray the death of the lovers as the loss of an ideal that can only be lamented. Several attempts have been made to link the lovers of the poem to historical individuals, though others have argued that the poem should not be interpreted with \\"appliqu√© literalism\\", in the words of James P. Bednarz. Indeed, exponents of the New Criticism such as I. A. Richards and William Empson emphasised the unresolvable nature of the text's ambiguities. Helen Hackett argues that the poem \\"invites deciphering, but at the same time firmly rebuff it.\\" Some of the more prominent attempted decodings of the allegory with reference to real individuals are listed below: =John and Ursula Salusbury= Because Chester dedicated the main poem to the Welsh statesman Sir John Salusbury and his wife Ursula Stanley, it has been argued that all the poems in the collection, including Shakespeare's, also celebrate the couple. Salusbury was a courtier at the court of Elizabeth I, and was a member of the powerful Salusbury Family of Wales. His wife Ursula was the illegitimate daughter of Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby. A difficulty with this view is the fact that the couple are known to have had ten children, but the poem refers to the relationship as a childless \\"married chastity\\". This is commented on elsewhere in the collection by John Marston, and all the poems in the collection emphasise the chaste and spiritual nature of the relationship, the couple's only child being the mysterious being born from their bodily deaths. The identification of the Salusburys as the subject was first argued in detail by Carleton Brown in 1913.Poems by Sir John Salusbury and Robert Chester by Carleton Brown. Brown tried to resolve the problem by arguing that it was written after the birth of the couple's first child, but not published until many years later. Later writers have sometimes argued that while Chester's Love's Martyr may be intended to celebrate the couple, Shakespeare's own poem does not. John Klause suggests that the \\"death\\" implied in Chester's work is symbolic of marriage and \\"sexual surrender\\", but in Shakespeare's poem death is literal.John Klause, \\"The Phoenix and the Turtle in its Time\\", in Gwynne Blakemore Evans (ed), In the Company of Shakespeare: Essays on English Renaissance Literature, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 2002, pp. 206‚Äì227. G. Wilson Knight suggested that the poem celebrates chaste love because it is about Salusbury's devotion to his sister, for whom Salusbury himself had written a poem.William Empson, Essays on Shakespeare, Cambridge University Press, 1986, p. 20. =Queen Elizabeth= Elizabeth's Phoenix jewel from the Phoenix portraitAn alternative is to interpret the Turtle as John Salusbury and the Phoenix as Queen Elizabeth I, which would explain the chastity of the relationship and the implication that their \\"child\\" is something mystical rather than physical. Elizabeth was often connected to the phoenix, and she is referred to as the \\"maiden phoenix\\" in the play Henry VIII, partly written by Shakespeare (though the \\"maiden phoenix\\" passage is typically attributed to John Fletcher). Two panel portraits attributed to Nicholas Hilliard are known as the \\"Phoenix\\" and \\"Pelican\\" portraits because of jewels the queen wears: her personal badges of the pelican and the phoenix. Both birds appear in Chester's main poem. An objection is that the intimacy between the lovers seems rather too strong for Salusbury and the queen.James P. Bednarz, Shakespeare and the Truth of Love: The Mystery of 'The Phoenix and Turtle', Palgrave Macmillan, 2012. Katherine Duncan-Jones and Henry Woudhuysen adopt a variation of the view that the poem refers to Salusbury and the queen, arguing that the \\"session\\" mentioned in the poem is the 1601 parliament, in which Elizabeth made a famous speech about the symbolic relationship between herself and her people, sometimes referred to as her Farewell Speech.Duncan-Jones and Woudhuyson, Shakespeare's Poems, Arden Shakespeare, Cengage Learning EMEA, 2007, p.421ff. They draw on the earlier work of Marie Axton, who argued that Elizabeth herself is both birds, in her monarchical and human aspects, but that the human aspect (the Turtle) also includes the body of the people as a whole. Duncan-Jones and Woudhuysen suggest that Salusbury represents the people. Some scholars interpret the child of the phoenix as a reference to Elizabeth's heir, James VI of Scotland. This imagery was used in 1604, when James arrived in London, but this would have been problematic in 1601, when Elizabeth was still alive. The theory that both Chester's and Shakespeare's poems were intended to refer to the relationship between Elizabeth and Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex was first proposed by A.B. Grosart in 1878, and was revived by William Matchett in 1965. Many authors who reject the identification of the lovers as Essex and Elizabeth nevertheless argue that the events of Essex's rebellion and execution in early 1601 may lie behind some of the more obscure symbolism in the poem and the others in the collection.John Finnis and Patrick Martin, \\"Another turn for the Turtle\\", The Times Literary Supplement, 18 April 2003 Sir John Salusbury had been knighted for helping to suppress the rebellion, while his cousin Owen Salusbury was killed while participating in it. Sir John's brother, Thomas Salusbury, had been executed after the earlier Babington Plot against Elizabeth. Duncan-Jones and Woudhuysen argue that Salusbury was \\"love's martyr\\" for putting devotion to his queen above his family.Helen Hackett, Shakespeare and Elizabeth: The Meeting of Two Myths, Princeton University Press, 2009, p. 136. Peter Ackroyd and James P. Bednarz both argue that Shakespeare may have written the poem to dissociate himself from Essex, with whom he was implicated because of his links to Essex's main ally the Earl of Southampton, and because his play about the overthrow of a monarch, Richard II, had been performed at the request of the rebels. For Bednarz \\"Shakespeare's name, subscribed to his poem in Love's Martyr shows his accommodation to the political order without endorsing any specific political position.\\"James P. Bednarz, p. 72. =Catholic martyrs= Another interpretation, first proffered in the 1930s by Clara Longworth in the novel My Shakespeare, Rise! is that the poem is a cryptic Roman Catholic eulogy and is part of the contention that Shakespeare was a secret Catholic sympathiser.Longworth, Clara, My Shakespeare, Rise!, London: 1935. The advocacy of prayers for the dead (\\"these dead birds\\") in the final line of the poem corroborates this interpretation.David Beauregard, pp. 141‚Äì144. Several critics, including Clare Asquith and David Beauregard, have noted that the poem ostensibly references Catholic liturgy and possibly the writings of the Catholic priest and poet Rev. Robert Southwell, SJ, who translated the Latin hymn Lauda Sion and also authored a poem praising the married chastity of St. Mary and St. Joseph. John Klause argued that the poem has various parallels to the Dies Irae of the Liturgy for the Dead, but suggests that its Catholic imagery satirises conventional Protestant attitudes expressed in Chester's poem, and that it is a subtle protest against the lauding of Sir John Salusbury, whose imagined death he supposes the poem celebrates. Proponents of the Catholic interpretation have suggested various identities for the poem's birds, but the interpretation that has the most traction is that the phoenix commemorates St. Anne Line, a Roman Catholic executed at Tyburn in 1601 and subsequently canonised by the Roman Catholic Church as a martyr.See the discussion in Shakespeare's Poems in Arden Shakespeare Series, 93‚Äì94. St. Anne Line and her young husband Roger were separated when he was imprisoned and then exiled after being arrested at a prohibited Catholic Mass. He died on the European continent a few years later and St. Anne began working for the Jesuits in London. She was arrested at a Candlemas liturgy and convicted of harbouring a Catholic priest, which led to her execution. Her body was retrieved from the common grave in the road and one of the Jesuits who knew her hinted that a secret requiem Mass was later offered for her.Martin Dodwell, Anne Line: Shakespeare's Tragic Muse (Brighton: The Book Guild, 2013). It was suggested that this requiem Mass provided the setting for Shakespeare's poem. The identification was corroborated by the belief that, like Shakespeare's couple, the Lines had no children. However, it has been proven since that they had a son named \\"John\\", whom relatives adopted.Christine J. Kelly, ‚ÄúAnne Line [St Anne Line] (d. 1601)‚Äù, ODNB, online edition, January 2009, http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/69035, accessed 3 November 2013. Clara Longworth first suggested that St. Anne Line is Shakespeare's phoenix and Mark Barkworth, a Catholic priest who reportedly embraced her body as it hung on the scaffold before he was also executed, is the turtle. John Finnis and Patrick Martin argued more recently that St. Anne Line is the phoenix and her husband Roger is the turtle.Times Literary Supplement, 18 April 2003, pp. 12‚Äì14. They concur with Clare Asquith that the \\"bird of loudest lay\\" represents the composer William Byrd, who was a Roman Catholic convert, and that the crow is the Catholic priest Rev. Henry Garnet, SJ.Asquith, Clare, Shakespeare Newsletter, 50, 2001. Martin Dodwell argued further that Shakespeare used St. Anne and Roger Line to symbolise the Catholic Church itself, as disinherited and rejected by England.  Text of the poem  The Phoenix and the Turtle Let the bird of loudest lay, On the sole Arabian tree, Herald sad and trumpet be, To whose sound chaste wings obey. But thou, shrieking harbinger, Foul pre-currer of the fiend, Augur of the fever's end, To this troop come thou not near. From this session interdict Every fowl of tyrant wing, Save the eagle, feather'd king: Keep the obsequy so strict. Let the priest in surplice white, That defunctive music can, Be the death-divining swan, Lest the requiem lack his right. And thou, treble-dated crow, That thy sable gender mak'st With the breath thou giv'st and tak'st, 'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go. Here the anthem doth commence: Love and constancy is dead; Phoenix and the turtle fled In a mutual flame from hence. So they lov'd, as love in twain Had the essence but in one; Two distincts, division none: Number there in love was slain. Hearts remote, yet not asunder; Distance, and no space was seen 'Twixt the turtle and his queen; But in them it were a wonder. So between them love did shine, That the turtle saw his right Flaming in the phoenix' sight: Either was the other's mine. Property was thus appall'd, That the self was not the same; Single nature's double name Neither two nor one was call'd. Reason, in itself confounded, Saw division grow together; To themselves yet either-neither, Simple were so well compounded That it cried how true a twain Seemeth this concordant one! Love hath reason, reason none If what parts can so remain. Whereupon it made this threne To the phoenix and the dove, Co-supreme and stars of love; As chorus to their tragic scene. THRENOS. Beauty, truth, and rarity. Grace in all simplicity, Here enclos'd in cinders lie. Death is now the phoenix' nest; And the turtle's loyal breast To eternity doth rest, Leaving no posterity:-- 'Twas not their infirmity, It was married chastity. Truth may seem, but cannot be: Beauty brag, but 'tis not she; Truth and beauty buried be. To this urn let those repair That are either true or fair; For these dead birds sigh a prayer.

Cassones, also called marriage chests or hope chests, were often used to carry the dowry goods in a marriage ceremony. A simple chest, called a wakis (wagon-kist) was commonly used in the Cape Colony as a seat on a wagon. To make it more usable, it often had a wooden support along the centre of the top so that the seated driver would not slide off so easily. In addition to this use, they were also used for storage at home; keeping clothes, food and other commodities safe. They were frequently made with one or more sides sloping downwards, although the top was always horizontal. Many are made of very good woods, like yellowwood and survived well.

In Medieval and early Renaissance times in Europe low chests were often used as benches while taller chests were used as side tables. By placing a chest on the side on any kind of rough table, the inner surface of its lid could be used as a proper writing surface while the interior could house writing implements and related materials, as was the case with the Bargue√±o desk of Spain. Many early Portable desks were stacked chests, with the top one having its lid on the side, to serve as a writing surface when opened. Many European chests did use the standard band of iron over the lid and the body of the chest to close it or lock it. There were a few different styles of the chest like square box or domed lid chests, which were so different that there wasn‚Äôt an effective way to categorize them.Pickvance, C.

He is notable for winning every engagement he participated in as the admiral of the Russian fleet present.  Life and naval career  Ushakov was born in the village of Burnakovo in the Yaroslavl gubernia, to a modest family of the minor nobility. His father, Fyodor Ignatyevich Ushakov, was a retired sergeant of the Preobrazhensky regiment of the Russian Imperial guards–û–≤—á–∏–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ –í.–î. –ê–¥–º–∏—Ä–∞–ª –§.–§. –£—à–∞–∫–æ–≤: –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤–Ω—ã–µ –¥–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤ –ª–µ–≥–µ–Ω–¥//–í–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤–∏—Å—Ç–∞. ‚Ññ2, 2012. . By the time Fyodor Ushakov submitted his statement of background (skaska) to the military, his family had not been officially confirmed in the so-called 'dvoryanstvo', yet they surely belonged to serving gentry. In the submission Ushakov stated that he neither had a coat-of-arms, nor a royal patent for a landed estate, and had no way to prove nobility. In 1798, Fyodor Ushakov, as a vice-admiral of the Black Sea Navy, submitted a request for official nobility and an arms providing a genealogical record. In 1807 his coat-of-arms was added to the General all-Russian book heraldry. In 1815 Fyodor Ushakov and his family were added to the part 6 (ancient nobility) of the Yaroslavl genealogical book. On 15 February 1761, he signed up for the Russian Navy in Saint Petersburg. After training, he served on a galley in the Baltic Fleet. In 1768 he was transferred to the Don Flotilla (Azov Sea Navy) in Taganrog, and served in the Russo-Turkish War (1768‚Äì74). He commanded Catherine II's own yacht, and was active in protecting Russian merchant ships in the Mediterranean during the First League of Armed Neutrality. After the Russian Empire conquered Crimean Khanate in 1783, Ushakov personally supervised the construction of a naval base in Sevastopol and the building of docks in Kherson. During the Russo-Turkish War (1787‚Äì92), he defeated the Ottomans at Fidonisi (1788), Kerch Strait (1790), Tendra (1790), and Cape Kaliakra (1791). In these battles, he demonstrated the ingenuity of his innovative doctrines in the art of naval warfare. In 1798 Ushakov was promoted to full admiral and given command of a squadron which sailed to the Mediterranean via Constantinople, where it joined with a Ottoman squadron. The combined Russian- Ottoman fleet then operated under Ushakov's command in the War of the Second Coalition against the French Republic. The expedition started by conquering the Ionian islands, acquired by France the year before from the defunct Republic of Venice in the Treaty of Campo Formio. This action culminated in the Siege of Corfu (1798‚Äì1799), and led to the subsequent creation of the Septinsular Republic. Ushakov's squadron then blockaded French bases in Italy, notably Genoa and Ancona, and successfully assaulted Naples and Rome. Tsar Paul, in his capacity as the Grand Master of the Order of St. John, ordered Ushakov to proceed to Malta, which a British fleet under Nelson was assisting in besieging. Grave of Ushakov in Sanaksar Abbey However, after rendezvousing with the Coalition forces on Malta, Ushakov was almost immediately recalled back home to Russia in 1800 (along with his fleet), where the new Emperor, Alexander I, failed to appreciate his victories. Ushakov resigned command in 1807 and withdrew into the Sanaksar Monastery in modern-day Mordovia. He was asked to command the local militia during the Patriotic War of 1812 but declined. In the course of 43 naval battles under his command he did not lose a single ship and never lost a battle.  Tactics  Distinguishing features of Ushakov's tactics were: use of unified marching and fighting orders; resolute closing to close quarters with the enemy forces without evolution of a fighting order; concentration of effort against enemy flagships; maintaining a reserve (Kaiser-flag squadrons); combination of aimed artillery fire and maneuvering; and chasing the enemy to its total destruction or capture. Giving great value to sea and fire training of his staff, Ushakov was a supporter of generalissimo Suvorov's principles of training for sailors and officers. Ushakov's innovations were among the first successful developments of naval tactics, from its \\"line\\" to maneuvering concepts.  Legacy  The statue of Ushakov in Saransk Several warships have been named after Admiral Ushakov. On 3 March 1944 the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR established the Order of Ushakov for Navy officers who showed outstanding achievement leading to victory over a numerically superior enemy. This medal was one of several which was preserved in Russia upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union, thus remaining one of the highest military awards in the Russian Federation. The Ushakov Medal was established simultaneously for servicemen who had risked their life in naval theatres defending the Soviet Union. In May 2014, the medal was presented to 19 surviving British sailors who had served on the Arctic convoys during World War II in a ceremony aboard HMS Belfast. The Baltic Naval Institute in Kaliningrad also carries his name. The minor planet 3010 Ushakov, discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Ivanovna Chernykh in 1978, is named after him.Dictionary of Minor Planet Names - p.247 In 1953 two Soviet films were released portraying his career Attack from the Sea and Admiral Ushakov. In both films he was played by Ivan Pereverzev. Ushakov is one of the eight patrons depicted in the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ at Patriot Park, Moscow  Canonization  The Russian Orthodox Church glorified Ushakov as a patron saint of the Russian Navy in 2000. His relics are preserved in Sanaksar Monastery. In 2005, in the Cathedral of St. Theodore Ushakov in Saransk (Mordovia), Patriarch Alexius II declared Saint Feodor Ushakov the patron saint of Russian nuclear-armed strategic bombers.

Macomber, 252 U.S. 189 (1920), was a tax case before the United States Supreme Court that is notable for the following holdings: *A pro rata stock dividend where a shareholder received no actual cash or other property and retained the same proportionate share of ownership of the corporation as was held prior to the dividend by the shareholder was not income to the shareholder under the Sixteenth Amendment. *An income tax that was imposed by the Revenue Act of 1916 on such a dividend was unconstitutional even if the dividend indirectly represented accrued earnings of the corporation.. Prior cases In 1895, the Supreme Court held in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. that a tax from income on property, unlike a tax on income from employment or vocations, had to be proportionate to the states' congressional representation. In 1913, the United States ratified the Sixteenth Amendment, which allowed taxation of income without regard to source (income from either property or vocations and employment) and without regard to a state's Congressional representation. In 1918, the Court, in Towne v. Eisner , had addressed a nearly-identical situation to one in Eisner v. Macomber. (Eisner was responsible for Internal Revenue Collection in both cases). However, in the aftermath of Towne v. Eisner, the US Congress passed a revenue collection statute that specifically stated that stock dividends were to be considered as income. Facts Mrs. Macomber owned 2,200 shares in Standard Oil, which declared a 50% stock dividend. She received 1,100 additional shares, about $20,000 in par value of which represented earnings accumulated by the company, recapitalized rather than distributed, since the effective date of the original tax law. The current statute expressly included stock dividends in income, and the government contended that the certificates should be taxed as income to Mrs. Macomber as if the corporation had distributed money to her. She sued Mark Eisner, the Collector of Internal Revenue, for a refund. =Economic substance of a stock dividend= The stock dividend in this case was the economic equivalent of a stock split, a transaction in which the corporation multiplies the total number of shares outstanding but gives the new shares to shareholders in proportion to the number that they had held. For example, if a corporation declares a \\"two for one\\" stock split and distributes no money or other property to any stockholder, a stockholder who held 100 shares at $4 per share will now hold 200 shares with a value of $2 each, both of which with $400 in value. =Stock dividends vs. cash dividends= A shareholder's assets do not grow after this sort of stock dividend. Metaphorically, the \\"pie\\" is still the same size, but it has been sliced into more pieces, each piece being proportionately smaller. Of course, the same is true of a cash dividend: the shareholder gains cash, but the corporation that is represented by his shares has also lost cash. The shares thus implicitly decline in value by an equal amount. A shareholder also makes no \\"sale or other disposition\\" of stock after this sort of stock dividend. The taxpayer still owns the same proportionate percentage of the corporation that was owned before the stock dividend. Again, that is true of a cash dividend as well. However, several important factors distinguish a stock and cash dividend. \\"Overall, the aim of the tax law is to impose a tax on \\"dividends\\" when assets representing corporate earnings are transferred to the shareholders. Stock dividends, however, merely give the shareholders additional pieces of paper to represent the same equitable interest; they do not transfer assets or create new priorities among the security-holders. The total value of the common shares, though now spread out over a larger number of units, is left unchanged from its previous level. In effect, nothing of substance has occurred.\\" The issue in the case was the following: Decision In the majority opinion, Justice Mahlon Pitney ruled that the stock dividend was not a realization of income by the taxpayer-shareholder for the purposes of the Sixteenth Amendment: ::We are clear that not only does a stock dividend really take nothing from the property of the corporation and add nothing to that of the shareholder, but that the antecedent accumulation of profits evidenced thereby, while indicating that the shareholder is richer because of an increase of his capital, at the same time shows he has not realized or received any income in the transaction. The Court noted that in Towne v. Eisner, it had clearly stated that stock dividends were not income, as nothing of value was received by Towne; the company was not worth any less than it was when the dividend was declared, and the total value of Towne's stock had not changed. Although the Court acknowledged the power of the Federal Government to tax income under the Sixteenth Amendment, it essentially said that Congress was not given the power to tax as income anything other than income. In others words, Congress did not have the power to redefine \\"income\\" as it appeared in the Constitution: ::Throughout the argument of the Government, in a variety of forms, runs the fundamental error already mentioned--a failure to appraise correctly the force of the term \\"income\\" as used in the Sixteenth Amendment, or at least to give practical effect to it. Thus, the Government contends that the tax \\"is levied on income derived from corporate earnings,\\" when in truth the stockholder has \\"derived\\" nothing except paper certificates which, so far as they have any effect, deny him [or \\"her\\" -- in this case, Mrs. Macomber] present participation in such earnings. It [the government] contends that the tax may be laid when earnings \\"are received by the stockholder,\\" whereas [s]he has received none; that the profits are \\"distributed by means of a stock dividend,\\" although a stock dividend distributes no profits; that under the Act of 1916 \\"the tax is on the stockholder's share in corporate earnings,\\" when in truth a stockholder has no such share, and receives none in a stock dividend; that \\"the profits are segregated from his [her] former capital, and [s]he has a separate certificate representing his [her] invested profits or gains,\\" whereas there has been no segregation of profits, nor has [s]he any separate certificate representing a personal gain, since the certificates, new and old, are alike in what they represent--a capital interest in the entire concerns of the corporation. The Court ordered that Macomber be refunded the tax she overpaid. =Dissents= In the dissent, Justice Louis Brandeis took issue with the majority's interpretation of income. He argued that the Sixteenth Amendment authorized Congress to tax \\"incomes, from whatever source derived\\" and that the authors of the amendment \\"intended to include thereby everything which by reasonable understanding can fairly be regarded as income.\\" Also, \\"Congress possesses the power which it exercised to make dividends representing profits, taxable as income, whether the medium in which the dividend is paid be cash or stock, and that it may define, as it has done, what dividends representing profits shall be deemed income.\\" He noted that in business circles, cash dividends and stock dividends were treated identically. In effect, he argued that a stock dividend is really a cash dividend since it is really two-step affair, with a cash distribution that is then used to purchase additional shares bu the exercise of stock subscription rights. Brandeis saw no reason for two essentially-identical transactions to be treated differently for tax purposes: Aftermath In any event, the success of investors in avoiding tax was short lived. The following year, the Court ruled that capital gains were income and that they should be recognized as income when the stock was sold. In addition, the exception for stock dividends was narrowed by the Court in such cases as United States v. Phellis, (shares in a subsidiary corporation that were issued to stockholders in the parent corporation were taxable as income); Rockefeller v. United States and Cullinan v. Walker (increases in capital accumulated by corporations over time were taxable when shares were distributed to stockholders in a successor corporation). In 1940, the Supreme Court departed from the realization concept described in Eisner v. Macomber when it held in Helvering v. Bruun, that \\"severance\\" is not an element of realization. In Bruun, a taxpayer-landlord repossessed a property from a tenant‚Äîproperty that had been subject to a 99-year lease after the tenant failed to pay rent and taxes. The lease had allowed for the tenant to construct a new building or other improvements. The tenant had removed the existing building and built a new one. The value of the new building, as of the date of repossession, was $64,245.68. The government contended that the landlord realized a gain of $51,434.25, the difference between the value of the building at the date of repossession and the landlord's basis in the old building of $12,811.43. The landlord argued that there was no realization of the property because no transaction had occurred, and that the improvement of the property that created the gain was unseverable from the landlord's original capital. The Court ruled against the landlord and decided that the landlord had realized a gain upon repossession of the property. The Court also said that \\"severance\\" was no longer an element of realization. Use by tax protesters Eisner v. Macomber is a key case in US income tax law. Its rather narrow but important application has been used by tax protesters who argue that wages from labor cannot be taxed as income. The Macomber decision was not about wages, but stock dividends. Here is a typical quote from the case used as evidence: > In order, therefore, that the clauses cited from Article I of the > Constitution may have proper force and effect save only as modified by the > Amendment, and that the latter also may have proper effect, it is essential > to distinguish between what is and what is not 'income' as the term is there > used; and to apply the distinction as cases arise according to truth and > substance without regard to form. Congress by any definition it may adopt > cannot conclude the matter, since it cannot by legislation alter the > Constitution, from which it derives its power to legislate, and within whose > limitations alone that power can be lawfully exercised [emphasis added] The Supreme Court in the case discussed what was income, and quoted from Towne v. Eisner: > Just as we deem the legislative intent manifest to tax the stockholder with > respect to such accumulations only if and when, and to the extent that, his > interest in them comes to fruition as income, that is, in dividends > declared, so we can perceive no constitutional obstacle that stands in the > way of carrying out this intent when dividends are declared out of a pre- > existing surplus.... Congress was at liberty under the amendment to tax as > income, without apportionment, everything that became income, in the > ordinary sense of the word, after the adoption of the amendment, including > dividends received in the ordinary course by a stockholder from a > corporation, even though they were extraordinary in amount and might appear > upon analysis to be a mere realization in possession of an inchoate and > contingent interest that the stockholder had in a surplus of corporate > assets previously existing. [emphasis added] Important principles in Eisner v. Macomber are that the word \\"income\\" in the Sixteenth Amendment is generally given its ordinary plain English meaning and that wealth and property that are not income may not be taxed as income by the Federal Government.

He is best known for his frequent collaborations with actor Burt Reynolds, usually in films involving fast cars, such as Smokey and the Bandit, Hooper, The Cannonball Run and Stroker Ace. In his later years, Needham moved out of stunt work, and focused his energy on the World Land Speed Record project. In 2001, Needham received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Taurus World Stunt Awards, and in 2012, he was awarded a Governors Award by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences.  Early years  Needham was born in Memphis, Tennessee, the son of Edith May (n√©e Robinson) and Howard Needham. He was raised in Arkansas and Missouri. Needham served in the United States Army as a paratrooper during the Korean War, worked as a treetopper (an arborist who performs tree topping services), and was a billboard model for Viceroy Cigarettes while beginning a career in Hollywood as a motion picture stuntman. Career Needham's first break was as the stunt double for actor Richard Boone on the popular TV western Have Gun, Will Travel. Needham trained under John Wayne's stunt double Chuck Roberson and quickly became one of the top stuntmen of the 1960s on such films as How the West Was Won, The Bridge at Remagen, McLintock!, The War Lord, and Little Big Man. He doubled regularly for Clint Walker and Burt Reynolds. Needham moved into stunt coordinating and directing second unit action, while designing and introducing air bags and other innovative equipment to the industry. Needham at one time lived in Reynolds' guesthouse for the better part of 12 years. In 1971, he and fellow stuntmen Glenn Wilder and Ronnie Rondell formed Stunts Unlimited. Needham had written a screenplay titled Smokey and the Bandit and his friend Reynolds offered him the chance to direct. The film was a huge hit, and the two followed it with Hooper, The Cannonball Run, and Stroker Ace. Needham also directed the TV pilots Stunts Unlimited (1980) and Stockers (1981), neither of which was picked up as a series. His final theatrical release as director was the 1986 BMX film Rad. In 1977, Gabriel Toys introduced the \\"Hal Needham Western Movie Stunt Set\\" complete with a cardboard old west saloon movie set, lights and props, a toy movie camera and a spring-launched Hal Needham action figure that would break through a balcony railing, land on breakaway table and chairs and crash through a window. They were only manufactured for a short time and have since become highly collectible. Needham moved out of stunt work, focusing his energy on the World Land Speed Record project that eventually became the Budweiser Rocket, driven most notably by stuntman Stan Barrett. The team failed to set an officially sanctioned World land speed record with the vehicle, and their claims to have broken the sound barrier in 1979 have been heavily disputed. In the 1980s, he and Reynolds co-owned the Mach 1 Racing team, which fielded the Skoal Bandit No. 33 car in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series for Harry Gant. In 2001, Needham received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Taurus World Stunt Awards. In 2012, he was awarded a Governors Award by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, where he was introduced by Quentin Tarantino. He died in 2013 at the age of 82 shortly after being diagnosed with cancer. Needham and his relationship with Reynolds inspired the Cliff Booth/Rick Dalton friendship in Tarantino's 2019 film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.

He began learning violin as a child, and continued his studies at the conservatory in St. Petersburg, Russia, where he was a classmate of Jascha Heifetz, Nathan Milstein and Mischa Elman. He left Russia in 1920 and traveled throughout Europe, until he arrived in Montreal in 1924. He quickly found work there at His Majesty's Theatre, in silent film houses, and other venues. He was one of the founders of the Traymore Quartet in 1925, which later became the Traymore Salon Orchestra. He was one of the first Canadians to specialize in Roma music and performed and conducted for a radio show that ran on the station CKAC for 40 years. Zbriger became a partner in, and eventually the sole owner of, the Montreal Hebrew Delicatessen. Better known as \\"Schwartz's\\", this restaurant is famous for its distinctive Montreal-style smoked meat. With the profits from this business, Zbriger spent many thousands of dollars organizing free concerts of his music. Zbriger was unable to pursue a career as a concert violinist because his wife was in poor health. Mrs. Zbriger was a pianist and co-composed music with Maurice, until her death after 65 years of marriage. Many of Zbriger's compositions were dedicated to famous people. He wrote The Vincent Massey March (1952) for the Canadian statesman of the same name, while \\"Mother's Lullaby\\" (1948) was dedicated to Charles, Prince of Wales upon his birth. The individuals honored by Zbriger frequently received copies of the music with letters he commissioned. In his later years, arthritis in his hands prevented Zbriger from performing publicly, though he continued to compose and conduct until his death.  Sources  * * Ianzelo, T.

It is located on the shores of Burley Lagoon and Henderson Bay, Washington of the Carr Inlet. The two bodies of water are separated by a sandspit and the Purdy Bridge, all within the Puget Sound. The Washington Corrections Center for Women, originally named the Purdy Treatment Center, is colloquially referred to as \\"Purdy\\", though it has a Gig Harbor address. As of the 2010 US Census, Purdy had a population of 1544. History Prior to white settlement, the area was inhabited by Native Americans, who fished and clammed on Henderson Bay. In 1884, one Isaac Hawk sold of land for $23.75 (). The purchaser was logger and Civil War veteran Horace Knapp (born March 23, 1845, in Titusville, Pennsylvania; died February 1, 1913, in Gig Harbor, Washington), who subdivided the land into lots and blocks to form the town of Purdy. The town's naming rights were taken by Joseph W. Purdy, a grocer from Tacoma, Washington, who had donated the materials to construct the community's first schoolhouse; the schoolhouse's land was donated by Knapp. On February 8, 1885, Knapp married Josephine Fuller, after which they moved to the Purdy area, making her Purdy's first white female settler.The Tacoma Times, March 19, 1939, \\"First White Woman to Live at Henderson Bay Expires\\" Knapp owned a floating logging camp on Burley LagoonThe Tacoma Times, June 11, 1948, \\"Old Purdy School Building Recalls Early Settlement\\" which included a cookhouse and bunks for the loggers. A mill was built in 1885 by James Ashton, Joseph Purdy, William Rowland, and a Mr. Sherman on a small inlet of Burley Lagoon just down the hill from present day Peninsula High School. In 1886, the Purdy mill secured its first contract to provide huge lumber with one edge beveled for the construction of a wooden dry dock at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in nearby Bremerton. The mill could underbid their competitors because they used an extra saw to cut the bevel, which allowed them to use only four trips of the saw carriage instead of five. Purdy became known as a \\"brawling mill town\\". The mill's success brought such conveniences as a grocery store and a post office to the area,Peninsula Historical Society the latter sited on Knapp's floating camp from 1886 to 1895 after which the function transferred to Springfield (Wauna, Washington). A long chute along present-day 144th Street brought logs down the hill to the water. The area's first Oyster factory was opened circa 1900 by a Mr Ouellette, known as \\"the Frenchman\\", to can oysters gathered from his land on the Purdy spit. Japanese oysters are still cultivated on Purdy's sandbars and in Burley Lagoon, as are clams. The original schoolhouse was abandoned in the 1890s. In 1900, the second Purdy Schoolhouse was built to replace it on land (also donated by Knapp) located on Sherman Avenue (present-day 68th Avenue). Students spent every other semester at either the Purdy Schoolhouse, or the Wauna Schoolhouse to keep both schools active. The modern-day Peninsula High School now sits on the hill where one of the original schoolhouses was built. The Second schoolhouse stood until 2015, when it was demolished to build a new home.

Early life He was born in Ostrava and has played guitar since he was 13. He began studies at the Technical University of Ostrava but eventually left the school. He tried various jobs, including as a freelance lyricist. He gained fame with his first song for Marie Rottrov√°, L√°sko, von√≠≈° de≈°tƒõm (You Smell of Rain, My Love; actually a cover version of the song She's Gone by Black Sabbath). He lives in Ostrava with his wife and two children.  Career  In 1982, he started performing in public, and his songs gained popularity. His first album, Darmodƒõj (The Wastrel), released in 1988, sold out immediately. A mythical aura arose around Nohavica which survived even the crisis period of his treatment for alcoholism. He released the somewhat pessimistic Mikymauzoleum (Mickey Mausoleum), an album containing mainly melancholic songs. In 1994, he recorded a live album, T≈ôi ƒçun√≠ci (Three Piglets), intended for children, with humorous songs. In 1996, Nohavica released Divn√© stolet√≠ (Strange Century). He and his producer employed new instruments and voices for the new songs on the album, which became a huge success. Two years later the Jaromir Nohavica and Kapela (i.e. the Band) came out with Koncert (Concert), a record featuring Nohavica playing with a band, which recognizably changed his music. The album contains mainly older material, but his treatment gave it a new appeal. His studio album from 2000, Moje smutn√© srdce (My Sad Heart), contained mostly sad songs about love. Nohavica also starred in Petr Zelenka's movie Rok ƒé√°bla (Year of the Devil), which was awarded the main prize at the 37th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in 2002 and several other international film festivals. He translated the Polish musical Painted on Glass for Divadlo Na Fidlovaƒçce and poeticized Mozart's opera Cos√¨ fan tutte for the National Moravian-Silesian Theatre. He enjoys popularity in neighbouring Poland and Slovakia, as well as Czech Republic. In 2007, Czech singer-songwriter Jaroslav Hutka accused Nohavica of having collaborated with the StB (the Communist-era Czechoslovak secret police). Documents released the previous year indicated that in the 1980s, Nohavica had met in Austria with the noted dissidents Karel Kryl and Pavel Kohout, and had then reported to the police on their activities.\\"Best-Selling Singer Called ‚ÄòSnitch‚Äô by Dissident Colleague,\\" Radio Praha, http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/best-selling-singer-called-snitch-by- dissident-colleague  Discography  = Extended play records = * Cesty (Roads) (EP, Panton 1985) * P√≠snƒõ pro V.

After being outnumbered and surrendering to Mexican forces at the Battle of Coleto Creek, Colonel Fannin and nearly all his 344 men were executed soon afterward at Goliad, Texas, under Santa Anna's orders for all rebels to be executed. He was memorialized in several place names, including a military training camp and a major city street of Houston. Early life and family Different sources say his year of birth as either 1804 or 1805. He was born in Georgia to Isham Fannin, a veteran of the War of 1812. His mother's last name was Walker. Although she was not married to his father, the Walker family raised him. His ancestors, who spelled the family name Fanning, lived in America during the Revolutionary War, a family with divided loyalties during the conflict. Isham's father James W. Fannin dropped the \\"g\\" from the family name and settled in Georgia.Brown (2000) pp.3-5 Fannin enrolled in the United States Military Academy at West Point on July 1, 1819.Brown (2000) p. 5 He resigned November 20, 1821, from the school. Although he seems to have been academically deficient, and was often tardy or absent from classes, he had received a letter from a cousin urging his immediate return to Georgia to attend to ailing grandparents.Brown (2000) p. 6 He married Minerva Fort. Their daughter, Missouri Pinckney, was born on July 17, 1829.Brown (2000) p. 10 A second daughter, Minerva, nicknamed Eliza, was born mentally ill in 1832.Brown (2000) pp. 12-16 While living in Columbus, Georgia, he enlisted in the militia and worked as a merchant.Brown (2000) p.8 In Muscogee County, he was a member of the Temperance Society and served for a short time as a judge.Brown (2000) pp.8-9 By 1832, Fannin was involved in the (illegal) business of transporting slaves. Texas Revolution In 1834, Fannin settled his family at Velasco, in colonial Tejas (now Texas), where he owned a plantation and was a managing partner in a slave-trading syndicate.Brown (2000) pp. 21,23-26 By 1835, Fannin was involved in the growing Anglo-American resistance to the Mexican government in Texas. He wrote letters seeking financial assistance and volunteers to help Texas. By September, Fannin was an active volunteer in the Texas Army.Brown (2000) p. 2 He took part in the Battle of Gonzales on October 2 and urged Stephen F. Austin to send aid to Gonzales. Fannin later worked with James Bowie, First Battalion, First Division, under Austin's orders to secure supplies and determine the conditions in and around Gonzales and San Antonio de Bexar. Under the command of Bowie,Brown (2000) p. 42 Fannin fought in the Battle of Concepci√≥n on October 28, 1835. In November 1835, Austin ordered Fannin and William B. Travis and about 150 men to cut off any Mexican supply party. On November 13, Houston offered Fannin the post of inspector general to the regular army. Fannin wrote back requesting a field appointment of brigadier general and a \\"post of danger\\". On November 22, 1835, Fannin was honorably discharged from the volunteer army by Austin and began campaigning for a larger regular army for Texas. He also went home to spend time with his family. Sam Houston, supported by Governor Henry Smith, commissioned Fannin as a colonel in the regular army on December 7, 1835. By January 7, 1836, the provisional government had appointed Fannin \\"military agent\\", to answer only to the council and not Houston. He began recruiting forces and supplies for the forthcoming and confusing Matamoros campaign against the Mexican city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Fannin had difficulty leading the volunteers in his charge. He tried to institute regular Army discipline, but his irregular volunteers would not accept it. Many of his men thought he was aloof, and several historians believe that he was an ineffective commander because of it. The majority of the men serving under Fannin had been in Texas only a short time; he was frustrated by this, writing to Lt. Governor James W. Robinson \\"... among the rise of 400 men at, and near this post, I doubt if 25 citizens of Texas can be mustered in the ranks...\\".Bradle (2007), pg. 135 In early February, Fannin sailed from Velasco and landed at Copano with four companies of the Georgia Battalion, moving to join a small band of Texians at Refugio. Mexican reinforcements under General Jose Urrea arrived at Matamoros, complicating the Texian plans to attack that city. Fannin withdrew 25 miles north to Goliad. Failed expedition to support the Alamo and aftermath Appeals from Travis at the Alamo (via James Bonham) prompted Fannin to launch a relief march of more than 300 men and four pieces of artillery on February 25, 1836. After some delay, Fannin and his men moved out on the 28th for the journey to San Antonio, a distance of more than 90 miles. The relief mission was a failure. The troops barely had crossed the San Antonio River when wagons broke down, prompting the men to camp within sight of Goliad.Moore (2004) p.28 They had little or no food, some men were barefooted, and the oxen teams wandered off during the night. On March 6, 1836, the Battle of the Alamo was fought, with all the Alamo's defenders (about 187 men) being killed by Mexican forces. The Mexican forces under General Jos√© de Urrea were now rapidly approaching the Texan stronghold in Goliad. They defeated Texian forces at the Battle of San Patricio on February 27, where 20 were killed and prisoners were taken. Frank W. Johnson and four other Texians were captured, but later managed to escape and rejoin James Fannin's command at Goliad.Todish,.Todish,Spring (1998) p.128 The Battle of Agua Dulce was fought on March 2. Dr. James Grant, Robert C. Morris and 12 others were killed, with prisoners taken. Pl√°cido Benavides and six others escaped to notify Fannin of the situation. On March 12, Fannin sent Captain Amon B. King and about 28 men to take wagons to Refugio to help evacuate the remaining families.Moore (2004) p.67 King and his men confronted an advance party of General Urrea's cavalry in the Battle of Refugio; his defense failed and he withdrew to the old mission.Todish,.Todish,Spring (1998) p.129 A local boy managed to get away and alerted Fannin to the skirmish. Fannin sent Lieutenant Colonel William Ward and about 120 men to King's aid. Ward managed to drive the small Mexican force away and decided to stay the night to rest his men. On March 14, 1836, Ward and King were attacked by Urrea and more than 200 Mexican soldiers as they were about to leave. This detachment was part of Urrea's larger force of nearly 1,200 men. The same day, General Houston ordered Fannin to retreat to Victoria. Fannin sent word to the men at Refugio to rendezvous with his command at Victoria. Other dispatches were intercepted by the Centralista forces, informing them of Fannin's plans. Fannin needed means of transport and had sent Albert C. Horton and his men to Victoria, to bring carts and 20 yokes of oxen from Army quartermaster John J. Linn, who did return around March 16. Horton's men would later form Fannin's advance guard during the retreat to Victoria. Fannin finally received the news of King and Ward's defeat from Hugh McDonald Frazer on March 17. Battle of Coleto Creek On March 19, 1836, Fannin led the Texians on a retreat from Presidio La Bahia (which Fannin had renamed Fort Defiance) and destroyed everything which they could not take with them. Transporting nine cannons and more than 500 spare muskets, Fannin's forces were also heavily laden with supplies and baggage. The column had traveled about 6 miles when Fannin ordered a halt to rest his animals. At about 3 pm, Mexican cavalry appeared. The Texians immediately formed a hollow square with their wagons and cannon placed in each corner for defense as Gen. Urrea's forces attacked. After a fierce battle, the Mexicans lost about 100 to 200 killed and wounded; Texian losses were seven to nine killed and 60 wounded. Facing overwhelming odds, though, Fannin and his troops surrendered the next day, at the Battle of Coleto.Hardin (1994), p. 173 The Goliad massacre The Mexicans took the Texans back to Goliad, where they were held as prisoners at Fort Defiance. The Texans thought they would likely be set free in a few weeks. General Urrea left Goliad, leaving command to Colonel Jose Nicolas de la Portilla. Urrea wrote to Santa Anna to ask for clemency for the Texans. Urrea wrote in his diary that he \\"... wished to elude these orders as far as possible without compromising my personal responsibility.\\" On March 26, 1836, 19:00, Santa Anna ordered Portilla to execute the prisoners. The next day, Palm Sunday, March 27, 1836, Colonel Portilla had 400 Texans marched out of Fort Defiance into three columns on the Bexar Road, San Patricio Road, and Victoria Road. They were shot point blank, between two rows of Mexican soldiers, and any survivors were clubbed or knifed to death. The 40 wounded men who could not walk were executed inside the fort compound. Fannin was the last to be executed, after seeing his men killed. He was taken by Mexican soldiers to the courtyard in front of the chapel, blindfolded, and seated in a chair (due to his leg wound from the battle). He made three requests: he asked for his personal possessions to be sent to his family, to be shot in his heart and not his face, and to be given a Christian burial. The soldiers took his belongings, shot him in the face, and burned Fannin's body along with the other Texans who died that day.Hardin (1994), p. 174\\"Frequently Asked Questions\\" , Presidio La Bahia Twenty-eight Texans escaped by feigning death and other means. Three known survivors escaped to Houston's army, where they fought in the Battle of San Jacinto. In numerous accounts of the Goliad Massacre, a Mexican woman, Francita Alavez, rescued about 20 Texan soldiers; she became known as \\"The Angel of Goliad\\". Other people were known to have rescued prisoners. At Victoria, the German-Mexican officer Juan Jos√© Holzinger saved two German Texans captured among King's men and 26 of Ward's troops by claiming to need them to build boats and transport cannon across the San Antonio River. In addition, Colonel Garay, Father Maloney (also referred as Molloy), Urrea's wife, and an unnamed girl were credited with rescuing prisoners during the Goliad Campaign. Legacy and honors James W.

For urban planning purposes, it is classified under the Toa Payoh area. Potong Pasir is particularly notable for being the longest-held opposition ward in one-party dominant Singapore. Its Opposition Member of Parliament Chiam See Tong held the ward from 1984 to 2011. Potong Pasir is easily accessible by the MRT station on the North East line. In 2011, the ward, led by Mrs. Lina Chiam, was lost to 3-time challenger Sitoh Yih Pin in what was the slimmest of margins of 114 votes; with 242 votes rejected. Mr. Chiam See Tong led a team of 5 to contest in the Bishan-Toa Payoh Group Representation Constituency (GRC) during that General Elections. History From 1910 to 1937, it was dominated by sand-quarries, hence giving it its present name, which means 'cut sand' in Malay. These mining activities created four ponds linked to the Kallang River, although they were reduced to two due to massive flooding in 1968. The ponds provided a good source of food for the local village folk, until pollution set in later. In the mid 1950s, Potong Pasir was one of the most important vegetable growing areas in Singapore. The land here had been cultivated since the 1830s. The farmers there were almost all Cantonese and they used traditional methods with great success. Leafy vegetables were grown on farms located in lowland areas such as Potong Pasir, Changi, Ponggol, and Sembawang. Watercress was the most important type of vegetable grown in Potong Pasir. A small portion of farmland was used for planting coconut palms. Vegetable farming in Singapore was a family business. Farmers of Potong Pasir lived in attap houses, in zinc roof and semi-concrete houses. The general condition of the rural roads was poor. Most farmers in the area leased their land from the Government. During the early years, Potong Pasir was also a site of regular flooding. Villagers would take refuge in nearby St Andrew's School, which was on Woodsville Hill. Rapid change took place for the past five decades, with the building of a bridge across the ponds in the 1950s, a venue for education introduced in the form of a village community centre in 1952, piped water and electricity in the 1960s, and by the 1970s, most of the villagers had already started to move out as the land was acquired by the government for massive redevelopment. Hence, a public housing estate, Potong Pasir Estate, began to take shape in the 1980s, with construction commencing in 1982, and the first blocks completed two years later. The sloping roof of some blocks became the most recognisable icon of Potong Pasir. From then till now, the ward has managed to retain its idyllic feel even as the pace of urbanisation has caught up with other areas. Historically, a road called \\"Jalan Potong Pasir\\" used to cut through the area. This historic road has since ceased to exist, but it defined the lines of the Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency as it started the current Lorong 8 Toa Payoh at Braddell Road and ending at Potong Pasir Avenue 1 at Upper Serangoon Road. Political history Potong Pasir is currently managed by Sitoh Yih Pin of the People's Action Party as of the recent 2020 General Elections. Before the 2011 General Elections, Singapore's then-longest serving opposition Member of Parliament (MP) and Secretary-General of the Singapore People's Party (SPP) (previously Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) until 1994, and part of Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) between 2001 and 2010), Chiam See Tong, served this constituency from 1984 to 2011. Elections in Potong Pasir have always been hotly contested as the ruling People's Action Party attempted to win the constituency. The current People's Action Party candidate, Sitoh Yih Pin (who made his debut in 2001), has much support from the party, despite the last candidate, Andy Gan (who later went to serve Marine Parade GRC in 2001), was defeated Potong Pasir from Chiam in the 1997 elections, even with the support the party gave him. In the 2006 elections, the People's Action Party promised extensive upgrading for Potong Pasir estate if Sitoh Yih Pin got elected as MP for the seat of Potong Pasir. Despite that, Chiam won for the sixth consecutive term, by a larger margin compared to 2001. In the 2011 elections, Lina Chiam, who took over the reins from incumbent Chiam See Tong (who contested and later defeated in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC), lost to twice- unsuccessful challenger Sitoh Yih Pin of the People's Action Party by a mere 114 votes in a close 7973‚Äì7859 vote count. Chiam was however eligible for a seat in a non-constituency Member of Parliament, by virtue she was the best performer among the losing candidates in this election; becoming the sole non- Workers' Party opposition member representing in the Parliament following the election. In the 2015 General Elections, Sitoh Yih Pin successfully defended this ward to Lina Chiam, this time with 66.41% of the votes. Chiam was not given an NCMP and thus ending a 31-year streak where SPP represented an opposition ward since 1984. In the 2020 elections, Sitoh again re-elected for a third term defeating new candidate Jose Raymond in a 60.7%-39.3% vote. Schools Potong Pasir estate is home to St Andrew's Village, a mega cluster of schools part of The Saints Family. It comprises St Andrew's Junior School, St Andrew's Secondary School and St Andrew's Junior College; together forming St. Andrew's School. The name of the school is usually abbreviated as SA or SAS. Its students and alumni ('Old Boys' and 'Old Girls') are referred to as Saints. In the 2000s, as part of the St Andrew's Village project, all three schools were planned to reunite in Potong Pasir. Renovation and expansion of the Junior School started in 2003, and the new buildings opened in December 2004. Construction of a new Secondary School started in 2003, opposite the Junior School along Francis Thomas Drive, and opened in December 2004. Construction of the Junior College started in June 2003 after the Secondary School vacated the site and shifted to its holding location. The Junior College opened in December 2005 and a ceremony was held to mark its return to Potong Pasir. The Village was officially opened on 26 August 2006, with the ceremony being held at the 1000-seater Cultural Centre in the Junior College.

Until 1972, Ceylon was a Commonwealth realm with Queen Elizabeth II as the head of state and Queen of Ceylon. He served as Governor-General during the tenure of different governments headed by Sirimavo Bandaranaike of the SLFP and Dudley Senanayake of the UNP.  Early life and education William Gopallawa was born on 17 September 1896 at the Dullewe Maha Walauwa, Dullewe, Aluvihare, a suburb of Matale. He is related to Dullewe Dissava, a signatory on behalf of the Sinhalese to the Kandiyan Convention of 1815, by his mother Tikiri Kumarihamy Dullewe. His father, Tikiri Bandara Gopallawa died when he was three years old. He received his primary education at the Dullewe village school and at St. John's College, Kandy. He continued his secondary education at Dharmaraja College, Kandy where he was a Scout and later moved to St. Anthony's College, Kandy. After having sat the Cambridge Senior Certificate Examination in 1917 he returned to Matale and joined as one of the tutorial staff of the Buddhist English School and was also instrumental in setting up a library and a Scout troop for the benefit of the students there.  Legal career  In 1920 William joined the Ceylon Law College, Colombo and was enrolled as a Proctor and Notary Public in 1924. He started his legal practice as a junior to Bernard Aluvihare in the unofficial bar of Kandy and went on to develop a practice in Matale, Dumbara and Kandy from 1924 until he took up duties as Municipal Commissioner, Kandy in 1939. He continued his practice on and off until he became the Municipal Commissioner of Colombo Municipal Council. Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne at the Sri Dalada Maligawa, Kandy  Political career  In 1926 Gopallawa contested and won in the Matale Urban Council Elections and served continuously in the council for a period of 13 years from 1926 to 1939. He served as the chairman of the Matale Urban Council for 5 years, at his office he was the youngest Urban Council Chairman in Ceylon at that time. In 1936 Gopallawa unsuccessfully contested for the Matale seat at the State Council Elections in 1936. In 1939 the Kandy Municipal Council was established and Gopallawa was appointed as the first Municipal Commissioner of Kandy. He served in that capacity throughout World War II and acquitted himself for efficiency during the great floods in 1950. In 1951 he was appointment as Municipal Commissioner of Colombo Municipal Council and served until 1957 when he stepped down from the post. Diplomatic role On 18 June 1958 when S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike's government started diplomatic relations with People's Republic of China Gopallawa was posted as the second Ambassador to China in 1960. On 7 September 1961, while he was serving in China, he was recalled and posted as the Ambassador to the United States; he served there until 1962. Governor-General of Ceylon and President of Sri Lanka In 1962, he was called back to Ceylon, after his son in law's sister, the then prime minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike nominated Gopallawa as Governor- General of Ceylon following Sir Oliver Goonetilleke's implication in the attempted military coup earlier that year. He was the second Ceylonese Governor-General and the first Buddhist to hold the post as the representative of Queen Elizabeth II who was the Head of State. Gopallawa served in this capacity until 1972. His constitutional decision to invite the UNP which won the majority of Parliamentary seats in the 1965 general election, (but not enough for an absolute majority) is heralded as a landmark moment where he respected the nation's constitution and its people's wishes more than the wishes of the defeated SLFP government (that appointed him as GG) which wanted him to delay inviting the winning party to form the government. It averted a major crisis of leadership. When Ceylon became the Republic of Sri Lanka on 2 March 1972, Gopallawa became the first President. He stepped down from office in February 1978 when then Prime Minister Junius Richard Jayewardene became President following constitutional changes that effected the creation of an executive Presidency. Faith While he was a devout Buddhist, he respected all faiths and never failed to attend the annual Vel Hindu ceremony and never failed to host Christmas carols and also attended various Muslim ceremonies in his role as titular head of state; he was acutely cognizant of his role as a unifier of all Sri Lankans during his tenure. He was the first to establish a spartan Buddhist Shrine room at the Queen's House. Family On 8 March 1928, Gopallawa married Seelawathie Rambukwella;they had 5 children. He was survived by 4 children out of 5. One died early on while he was still working in Matale. His eldest daughter Chandrika Iranganie married Dr. Mackie Ratwatte, the private secretary and a brother of Sirimavo Bandaranaike. His oldest son Asoka is a entrepreneur businessman, His Second daughter Chinthamani, was a teacher and landed proprietor and his youngest son Monty Gopallawa who died in 2005 was a member of parliament and an affable cabinet minister in the government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga (daughter of Sirimavo Bandaranaike).

This latter act, which also included the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act of 2000 (AGOA), was intended to advance U.S. economic and security interests by strengthening American relationships with other regions of the world then viewed to be making significant strides in terms of economic development and political reform. The 23 independent countries of the Caribbean basin region together form the sixth largest export market for U.S. goods, totaling $19 billion and absorbing 2.7 percent of U.S. exports in 1999. However, the devastation of hurricanes Mitch and Georges in 1998 set the regional economy back. In addition, the U.S.'s signing of the NAFTA with Mexico in 1994 had caused Caribbean basin countries to lose the preferential treatment they had previously enjoyed. The CBTPA, an expansion of the 1983 Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), sought to address those issues. In particular, the CBTPA extended preferential tariff treatment to textile and apparel products assembled from U.S. fabric that were previously excluded from the program. American policy makers hoped that this would encourage additional U.S. exports of cotton and yarn and U.S. investment in the region, thereby improving the global competitive position of the U.S. textile industry. The CBTPA was also intended to encourage the diversification of CBI countries‚Äô economies, viewed by American policymakers as a key step towards economic development that would decrease the region's dependence on aid and reduce illegal immigration into the United States as well as the trafficking of illegal drugs. American lawmakers also hoped that CBTPA would send a signal to the other countries of the Caribbean basin and elsewhere of American commitment to promoting trade-expanding policies.

In the early days of his career, while still unknown, his contributed comics to a magazine that won him a prize, an event that led him deeper into the world of comics. In 1976 he moved to Tokyo and began to study under the famous Japanese manga artist, Osamu Tezuka. During the period he worked with the Manga Department of Tezuka Productions, his illustration work entitled \\"Mother Earth, Turn Green Again\\" was awarded the Tezuka Award. In 1977, he began drawing for Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump, a popular Japanese manga magazine. From around the beginning of the 1980s, he began to see the personal computer as a tool for the creative purposes. In 1985, he kicked off an eight-color comic book series called BAT. In the ensuing years, in parallel with advances in the personal computer, he created TAKERU (1992), the world's first computer graphics comic book series. Next came Cobra, Bat and Gundragon Sigma (in this latter series, only the main character is drawn by hand) and several other works. His works include original works, scenarios and works he has directed. Representative works include a CD-ROM format work for use with a PC, COBRA II: A Man of Legend and original animation videos such as GOKU, GOKU II, Raven Tengu Kabuto and others.

In the early-morning hours of October 9, 1835, Texas settlers attacked the Mexican Army soldiers garrisoned at Presidio La Bah√≠a, a fort near the Mexican Texas settlement of Goliad. La Bah√≠a lay halfway between the only other large garrison of Mexican soldiers (at Presidio San Antonio de Bexar) and the then-important Texas port of Copano. In September, Texians began plotting to kidnap Mexican General Mart√≠n Perfecto de Cos, who was en route to Goliad to attempt to quell the unrest in Texas. The plan was initially dismissed by the central committee coordinating the rebellion. However, within days of the Texian victory at the Battle of Gonzales, Captain George Collinsworth and members of the Texian militia in Matagorda began marching towards Goliad. The Texians soon learned that Cos and his men had already departed for San Antonio de B√©xar but continued their march. The garrison at La Bah√≠a was understaffed and could not mount an effective defense of the fort's perimeter. Using axes borrowed from townspeople, Texians were able to chop through a door and enter the complex before the bulk of the soldiers were aware of their presence. After a 30-minute battle, the Mexican garrison, under Colonel Juan L√≥pez Sandoval, surrendered. One Mexican soldier had been killed and three others wounded, while only one Texian had been injured. The majority of the Mexican soldiers were instructed to leave Texas, and the Texians confiscated $10,000 worth of provisions and several cannons, which they soon transported to the Texian Army for use in the Siege of B√©xar. The victory isolated Cos's men in B√©xar from the coast, forcing them to rely on a long overland march to request or receive reinforcements or supplies. Background In 1835, Mexico operated two major garrisons within its Texas territory, the Alamo at San Antonio de B√©xar and Presidio La Bah√≠a near Goliad. B√©xar was the political center of Texas, and Goliad laid halfway between it and the major Texas port of Copano. Military and civilian supplies and military personnel were usually sent by sea from the Mexican interior to Copano Bay and then could be transported overland to the Texas settlements. General Mart√≠n Perfecto de Cos In early 1835, as the Mexican government transitioned from a federalist model to centralism, wary colonists in Texas began forming Committees of Correspondence and Safety. A central committee in San Felipe de Austin coordinated their activities.Huson (1974), p. 4. The Texians staged a minor revolt against customs duties in June; these Anahuac Disturbances prompted Mexican President Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna to send additional troops to Texas.Roell (1994), p. 36. In July, Colonel Nicolas Condelle, led 200 men to reinforce Presidio La Bah√≠a. The following month, a contingent of soldiers arrived in B√©xar with Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea.Huson (1974), p. 5. Fearing that stronger measures were needed to quell the unrest, Santa Anna ordered his brother-in-law, General Mart√≠n Perfecto de Cos to \\"repress with strong arm all those who, forgetting their duties to the nation which has adopted them as her children, are pushing forward with a desire to live at their own option without subjection to the laws\\". Cos landed at Copano Bay on September 20 with approximately 500 soldiers. Cos briefly toured the port at Copano Bay and the small garrison at nearby Refugio and left small groups of soldiers to reinforce each of these locations.Huson (1974), p. 7. The main body of soldiers arrived in Goliad on October 2. Unbeknownst to Cos, as early as September 18, several Texians, including James Fannin, Philip Dimmitt, and John Lin, had independently begun advocating a plan to seize Cos at either Copano or Goliad. As soon as Cos's warships were spotted approaching Copano Bay, Refugio colonists sent messengers to San Felipe de Austin and Matagorda to inform the other settlements of Cos's imminent arrival. Concerned that a lack of artillery would make the presidio at Goliad impossible to capture, the central committee chose not to order an assault.Huson (1974), p. 8. Although Fannin, Dimmitt, and Linn continued to push for an attack on Goliad, Texian attention soon shifted towards Gonzales, where a small group of Texians were refusing to obey orders from Ugartechea. Colonists eagerly rushed to assist, and on October 2 the Battle of Gonzales officially opened the Texas Revolution. After learning of the Texian victory, Cos made haste for B√©xar. He left with the bulk of his soldiers on October 5, but because he was unable to find adequate transportation most of his supplies remained at La Bah√≠a. Prelude This map marks the location of Goliad in Texas. The battle took place near the town. On October 6, members of the Texian militia in Matagorda convened at the home of Sylvanus Hatch. As their first order of business they elected George Collinsworth as their captain; Dr. William Carleton was then named first lieutenant and D.C. Collinsworth became the unit's second lieutenant. After appointing their leaders, the men decided to march on La Bah√≠a. They intended to kidnap Cos and, if possible, steal the estimated $50,000 that was rumored to accompany him.Hardin (1994), p. 14. The Texians sent messengers to alert nearby settlements of their quest. By afternoon, 50 Texians were ready to march from Matagorda.Scott (2000), p. 18. During the march, for unknown reasons the men fired Carleton and appointed James W. Moore as the new first lieutenant. The following day the expedition stopped at Victoria, where they were soon joined by English-speaking settlers from other settlements and 30 Tejanos led by Pl√°cido Benavides. Although no accurate muster rolls were kept, historian Stephen Hardin estimated that the Texian ranks swelled to 125 men. Forty-nine of them signed a \\"Compact of Volunteers under Collinsworth\\" on October 9. These men pledged that they were loyal to the Mexican federal government and would harm no one who remained loyal to the federalist cause.Hardin (1994), p. 15. One of the new arrivals, merchant Philip Dimmitt, received a missive from the Goliad customs agent with news that Cos and his war chest had already departed La Bah√≠a to travel to San Antonio de B√©xar.Huson (1974), p. 11. Undeterred, the group marched out on October 9. Ira Ingram led the vanguard, which halted outside Goliad.Huson (1974), p. 14. The events that follow are not very clear. According to the memoirs of Mexican General Vicente Filisola, who was not in Texas in 1835, the Texians plotted to draw the presidio commander, Colonel Juan L√≥pez Sandoval, and his officers from the fort. The Texians allegedly planned a dance in Goliad on October 9 and invited the Mexican officers. Although Sandoval, Captain Manuel Sabriego, and Lieutenant Jesus de la Garza briefly attended the dance, they suspected mischief and returned to the fort.Huson (1994), p. 15. No Texian source mentions such a plot. Several of the Texians, including Dimmitt, did enter the town that evening to try to find guides and support for the effort. Dimmitt's efforts were successful, and several of the Tejanos who lived near Goliad joined the Texian force. They reported that Sandoval commanded only 50 men-- far fewer than the number necessary to defend the entire perimeter of the fort --and provided directions to the fort.Scott (2000), p. 19.Hardin (1994), p. 16. The main body of Texian soldiers, under Collinsworth, became disoriented in the dark and wandered from the road. They were soon tangled in a mesquite thicket. While working their way back towards the road, the Texians met Ben Milam, a Texas colonist who had recently escaped from prison in Monterrey. Milam joined the militia as a private, and the group soon rejoined the vanguard. Battle As the combined Texian force prepared for battle, they sent a messenger to instruct the alcaldeAn alcalde is roughly equivalent to a mayor. of the city to surrender. At 11 pm, the alcade responded that the town would remain neutral, neither surrendering nor fighting. Several of the locals did, however, supply axes to the Texian militia. The Texians divided themselves into four groups, each assigned a different approach to the presidio.Huson (1974), p. 16. In the pre-dawn hours of October 10, the Texians attacked. The lone sentinel managed to give the alarm but was immediately shot dead. The Texians quickly hacked through a door on the north wall of the fortress and ran to the interior courtyard. Hearing the commotion, the Mexican soldiers had lined the walls to defend the fort.Scott (2000), p. 20. The Mexican soldiers opened fire, hitting Samuel McCulloch, a former slave whom George Collinsworth had freed, in the shoulder. Texians returned fire for approximately 30 minutes. During a pause in the fighting, a Texian spokesman yelled out that they would \\"massacre everyone of you, unless you come out immediately and surrender\\". The Mexican garrison immediately surrendered.Hardin (1994), p. 17. Aftermath McCulloch was the only Texian soldier to be wounded, and he later claimed to be the \\"first whose blood was shed in the Texas War for Independence\\".Scott (2000), p. 21. This distinction earned him a permanent home; a later law prohibited any freed slave from residing in the Republic of Texas, but in 1840 the Texas legislature specifically excluded McCulloch, his family, and his descendants from its enforcement. The exclusion was reward for McCulloch's service and his injury.Huson (1974), p. 13. Estimates of Mexican casualties range from one to three soldiers killed and from three to seven wounded. Approximately 20 soldiers escaped. They warned the garrisons at Copano and Refugio of the advancing Texians; those garrisons abandoned their posts and joined the soldiers at Fort Lipantitl√°n. Milam escorted the remaining Mexican soldiers to Gonzales, where the newly formed Texian Army was located.Roell (1994), p. 40. The Texian Army commander, Stephen F. Austin, later released all of the men, on the condition that they leave Texas and vow to stop fighting Texas residents. One wounded Mexican soldier was allowed to remain in Goliad, as was Captain Manuel Sabriego, who was married to a local woman. In secret, Sabriego began organizing a group of settlers in the Goliad area who sympathized with Mexico. Texian troops confiscated the provisions they found at the fort. Although they found 300 muskets, most of them were broken and unable to be repaired. Dimmitt hired two gunsmiths who were able to bring the remaining weapons into service.Huson (1974), p. 18. The food, clothing, blankets, and other provisions were valued at US$10,000. The new quartermaster at the fort, John J. Linn, reported that 175 barrels of flour were confiscated, along with a large supply of sugar, coffee, whiskey, and rum. For the next three months, the provisions were parceled out among companies in the Texian Army. The Texians also gained control of several cannons. Over the next several days, more Texian settlers joined the group at La Bah√≠a. Many of them were from Refugio, a sprawling settlement that was furthest from Matagorda. Historian Hobart Huson speculates that these men were the last to receive word of the planned attack.Huson (1974), p. 17. Austin ordered that 100 men remain at Goliad, under the command of Dimmitt, while the rest should join the Texian Army in marching on Cos's troops in B√©xar. Collinsworth returned to Matagorda to recruit additional soldiers, but on October 14 the remaining Texians at Goliad began the march towards B√©xar. The loss of Goliad meant that Cos lost his means of communicating with Copano Bay, the closest port to B√©xar. The Mexican troops garrisoned at B√©xar would now need to get supplies and reinforcements overland.Hardin (1994), p. 19.

While the NHL had established working relationships with teams in leagues such as the AHL and WHL, these leagues and their teams were not fully under the control of the NHL, and in this era they operated more independently than is the case today. The Eastern Professional Hockey League was created in 1959 as the first farm league fully run and controlled by the NHL. While the league proved to be a success on the ice, it largely failed off the ice. Attendance in these smaller cities could not support professional hockey, and by 1962, the league was reduced to just four teams. While the intent was for the EPHL to be the primary development league for the NHL, the Detroit Red Wings did not participate until the final season, and the Toronto Maple Leafs never had an affiliate. During its final season the league played an interlocking schedule with the International Hockey League. Following the demise of the EPHL, the NHL created the new Central Hockey League of minor-pro farm teams in larger, midwestern U.S. cities. Four of the CHL's initial five franchises were relocations of the previous season's EPHL teams.

In combat, a body count is often based on the number of confirmed kills, but occasionally only an estimate. Often used in reference to military combat, the term can also refer to any situation involving multiple killings, such as the actions of death squads or serial killers. The military gathers such figures for a variety of reasons, such as determining the need for continuing operations, estimating efficiency of new and old weapons systems, and planning follow-up operations. Military use Body count figures have a long history in military planning and propaganda. =Sassanian Empire= According to Procopius, when the Persians are about to march to a war, the king sits on the throne and many baskets are set before him. The men of the army pass along the baskets one by one, each throwing one arrow in the baskets, which are then sealed with the king's seal. When the army returns to Persia, each man takes an arrow, and the number of casualties will be determined by the number of remaining arrows.Prokopios, The Wars of Justinian, translated by H. B. Dewing, Hackett Publishing, 2014, , page =The Holocaust= During the Holocaust in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and other eastern areas, killing was done by Nazi Germany's military police forces, including Einsatzgruppen, the SD, and Wehrmacht police battalions, in massacres by shooting the victims. Such units measured their progress by counting the number of people killed. These murder operations took place under the guise of anti-partisan warfare, but in reality few of those killed were actually partisans. =Vietnam War= Since the goal of the United States in the Vietnam War was not to conquer North Vietnam but rather to ensure the survival of the South Vietnamese government, measuring progress was difficult. All the contested territory was theoretically \\"held\\" already. Instead, the U.S. Army used body counts to show that the U.S. was winning the war. The Army's theory was that eventually, the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army would lose after the attrition warfare. According to historian Christian Appy, \\"search and destroy was the principal tactic; and the enemy body count was the primary measure of progress\\" in General Westmoreland‚Äôs war of attrition. Search and destroy was coined as a phrase in 1965 to describe missions aimed at flushing the Viet Cong out of hiding, while the body count was the measuring stick for the success of any operation. This method was controversial, due to two issues. The first is regarding the counting of unarmed civilians killed in actions as enemy combatants in free-fire zone as it was estimated that around 220,000 civilians killed by US/ARVN battle operations were miscounted as \\"enemy KIA\\". Another issue is inflationhttps://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-31/news/mn-442_1_body-countand fabrication of body count in after-action reports, which is reported to have given false and inaccurate casualty figures for enemy dead. =Iraq War= In the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the US military adopted an official policy of not counting deaths. General Tommy Franks' statement that \\"we don't do body counts\\" was widely reported. Critics claimed that Franks was only attempting to evade bad publicity, while supporters pointed to the failure of body counts to give an accurate impression of the state of the war in Vietnam. At the end of October 2005, it became public that the US military had been counting Iraqi fatalities since January 2004 but only those killed by insurgents and not those killed by the US forces.\\"U.S. Quietly Issues Estimate of Iraqi Civilian Casualties\\", The New York Times See also * Casualty estimation * Casualty prediction * Loss exchange ratio References Bibliography *U.S. Army War College, Study on Military Professionalism, 1970 Category:Military terminology Category:Euphemisms Category:Attrition warfare Category:Military science ","title":"Body count"},{"id":"1147674","text":"London Police may refer to: ;Current *City of London Police, the police force for the square-mile sized district known as the City of London *Metropolitan Police Service, the police force for Greater London, excluding the City of London *London Police Service, the police force for London, Ontario, Canada ;Historical *Bow Street Runners (1749-1839), called London's first professional police force *Marine Police Force (1798-1839), said to be England's first police force, merged into the Metropolitan Police Service  See also  *List of law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom#National forces and agencies ","title":"London Police"},{"id":"1147677","text":"Apparat can mean: * The bureaucratic apparatus, staffed by Apparatchiki, in the Soviet Union * Apparat (musician), Sascha Ring, a German electronic musician * Apparat Organ Quartet, an Icelandic band * Apparat Singles Group, a fictional comic book publisher See also * Aparat, an Iranian video sharing service ","title":"Apparat"},{"id":"1147680","title":"Little Creatures"},{"id":"1147681","text":"Topanga is a census-designated place (CDP) in western Los Angeles County, California, United States. Located in the Santa Monica Mountains, the community exists in Topanga Canyon and the surrounding hills. The narrow southern portion of Topanga at the coast is between the city of Malibu and the Los Angeles neighborhood of Pacific Palisades. As of the 2010 census the population of the Topanga CDP was 8,289. The ZIP code is 90290 and the area code is primarily 310, with 818 only at the north end of the canyon. It is in the 3rd County Supervisorial district. History Topanga is the name given to the area by the Native American indigenous Tongva tribe,Bright, W. (1998). 1500 California Place Names 3rd Ed.

It was the western border of their territory, abutting the Chumash tribe that occupied the coast from Malibu northwards. Bedrock mortars can be found carved into rock outcroppings in many locations. Topanga was first settled by Europeans in 1839.\\"Topanga\\". California State University Northridge. In the 1920s, Topanga Canyon became a weekend getaway for Hollywood stars with several cottages built for that purpose. The rolling hills and ample vegetation served to provide both privacy and attractive surroundings for the rich and famous. During the 1960s, Topanga Canyon became a magnet to many new artists. In 1965 Wallace Berman settled in the area. For a time, Neil Young lived in Topanga, first living with producer David Briggs then later buying his own house. He recorded most of his After the Gold Rush album in his basement studio in 1970. Charles Manson had previously been living in Topanga, where he had briefly befriended both Neil Young and Dennis Wilson of The Beach Boys. Members of the Manson Family began their campaign of murder on July 31, 1969, with the murder of Topanga resident Gary Hinman, a music teacher who had opened his home to anyone needing shelter. Geography =Topanga Canyon= Topanga Creek drains Topanga Canyon and is the third largest watershed entering the Santa Monica Bay. The creek is one of the few remaining undammed waterways in the area, and is a spawning ground for steelhead trout. The area typically receives about of rain annually. Topanga Beach lies on the coast at the outlet of Topanga Creek. Topanga Canyon Boulevard, State Route 27, is the principal thoroughfare, connecting the Ventura Freeway (US 101) to the north with Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1) on the south. The southern portion of the boulevard largely follows Topanga Creek. North of the Old Topanga Canyon Road intersection, the boulevard traverses the Santa Monica Mountains. Topanga Canyon contains lands of Topanga State Park, the largest park in the Santa Monica Mountains and one of the largest open space preserves surrounded by a city in the world, as well as the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. It is part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. It primarily represents a California coastal sage and chaparral ecoregion, with large areas of the California oak woodland plant community, and a wide variety of native plants. =Climate= This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above . According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Topanga has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \\"Csb\\" on climate maps.

Topanga, California, as viewed from the Topanga Overlook Lower Topanga Canyon The bottom of Topanga Canyon, where it meets Pacific Coast Highway and the ocean, was owned for many years by the Los Angeles Athletic Club, a wealthy private club in downtown Los Angeles. The parcel was rented out to a variety of businesses and residents for decades at remarkably low rents, considering that it borders the city of Malibu. Thus Lower Topanga became unique as one of the last outposts of the classic Topanga Canyon bohemian hippie lifestyle. The Chumash people considered Lower Topanga a sacred, economic, and cultural meeting place for tribes all along the coast. One of the main neighborhoods, the \\"Rodeo Grounds\\", takes its name from an actual rodeo arena that existed there on a Mexican ranch in the 1800s. (Another neighborhood, \\"The Snake Pit\\", was named both for its abundance of rattlesnakes and for the shifty characters who passed through like Charles Manson.) In the early 1900s, Lower Topanga was a Japanese fishing village. William Randolph Hearst owned the property for a time and turned it into a weekend getaway spot with beach shacks for his and Marion Davies' guests. In the '60s, a lively community of artists and surfers sprang up in Lower Topanga. They maintained their houses without assistance, sometimes digging them out of the mud after floods or setting backfires to prevent a spreading wildfire from burning down their neighborhood. The roads remained unpaved.Capra, Pablo. Idlers of the Bamboo Grove: Poetry from Lower Topanga Canyon. Brass Tacks Press, 2002. In 2001, Lower Topanga was sold to California State Parks. Even though the Lower Topanga community occupied less than 2% of the total purchased land, State Parks had an aggressive policy to relocate everyone and bulldoze all of the houses. (State Parks had already evicted residents who lived directly on Topanga Beach in the late '70s.Lovas, Paul. Topanga Beach Experience. Brass Tacks Press, 2011.) A group of 10 Lower Topanga poets calling themselves the \\"Idlers of the Bamboo Grove\\" published a book of the same name in 2002, celebrating their community and lamenting the prospect of having to leave. Their publisher, Brass Tacks Press, continued publishing works about Lower Topanga, including The Snake Pit by Baretta (2006), Tool's Snake Pit by Tool (2007), Rohloff's Snake Pit by Chris Rohloff (2009), and Topanga Beach Experience: 1960s‚Äì70s by Paul Lovas and Pablo Capra (2011) ‚Äì as well as maintaining an online Lower Topanga Photo Archive. Even though Lower Topanga residents were given money to leave, some fought bitterly against their relocation in court. However, the last holdouts were forced off the land in March 2006. Currently there are active efforts by TreePeople and Mountains Restoration Trust to restore the area to its pristine condition as it was prior to development. Culture Topanga is known as a bohemian enclave attracting artists, musicians, filmmakers, and others. Numerous music festivals have been organized in the canyon, including the Topanga Days Festival and Topanga Earth Day. The Topanga Film Institute hosts the annual Topanga Film Festival. In the 1950s, blacklisted actor Will Geer had to sell his large Santa Monica home and move his family to a small plot in the canyon where they could grow their own produce. Geer's friend Woody Guthrie had a small shack on the property. They unintentionally founded what became an artists' colony. Since its founding in 1973, the Geer family has continued to operate the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum. It has grown into an Equity theater, and occupies a natural outdoor amphitheater. It features Shakespearean plays, modern classics, and original productions, as well as musical concerts. Performers have included Pete Seeger, Arlo Guthrie, Della Reese, and Burl Ives. Odetta was part of the early music scene in the 1960s. A famous venue in the canyon was the Elysium Institute, also known as Elysium Fields, a nudist club started by Ed Lange in 1967. After surviving extended battles with county officials the property was sold in 2002 by its founder's heirs. Every Memorial Day weekend on the grounds of the Topanga Community House, Topanga has an annual fair and parade, called Topanga Days. Topanga Days Country Fair features music, belly dancing, over 80 unique craft vendors and a variety of food from Cajun to Mexican to vegan. A parade is held on Memorial Day. The parade is said to have inspired the more famous Doo-Dah Parade in Pasadena. Topanga canyon also sees and annual reggae festival \\"Reggae on the Mountain\\" that has grown to be one of the largest events in the area. The event serves as a fundraiser for the Topanga Community Club in a similar fashion as Topanga Days. The Topanga Film Institute presents the annual Topanga Film Festival each July. The festival endeavors to bridge cultures, create and expand community, provide cultural exchange and networking opportunities. Two outdoor shopping centers featuring local businesses form the hub of local commerce. There are no hotels, motels or gas stations in Topanga, nor are there any chain or big box stores. The location of Topanga in the Santa Monica Mountains also makes the natural surroundings an important part of the culture. Streams, waterfalls, cliffs of exposed bedrock, landmark rock outcroppings, and overlooks with panoramic views of the mountains, Pacific Ocean and Los Angeles are common attractions.

They were required to assimilate and renounce tribal Cherokee citizenship.\\"Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.\\" (retrieved July 25, 2011) The history of the Eastern Band closely follows that of the Qualla Boundary, a land trust made up of an area of their original territory. When they reorganized as a tribe, they had to buy back the land from the US government. The EBCI also own, hold, or maintain additional lands in the vicinity, and as far away as from the Qualla Boundary. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians are primarily the descendants of those persons listed on the Baker Rolls of Cherokee Indians. They gained federal recognition as a tribe in the 20th century. The Qualla Boundary is not a reservation per se because the land is owned by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians is one of three federally recognized Cherokee tribes, the others being the Cherokee Nation and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians, both based in Oklahoma. Its headquarters is in the namesake town of Cherokee, North Carolina in the Qualla Boundary, south of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. History, language and religion Joel Queen, award- winning Eastern Band sculptor and ceramic artist The Eastern Band members are primarily descended from about 800 Cherokee living along the remote Oconaluftee River who did not participate in the Trail of Tears to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). Principal Chief Yonaguska, with the help of his adopted European-American son, William Holland Thomas, managed to avoid removal. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians have maintained many traditional tribal practices. Many prominent Cherokee historians are affiliated with, or are members of the Eastern Band. Tsali (pronounced ) opposed the removal. He remained in the traditional Cherokee lands with a small group who resisted the U.S. Army and tried to thwart the removal. Tsali was eventually captured. He was executed by the United States in exchange for the lives of the small band he protected. They were allowed to remain in the Cherokee homeland, with the condition that they give up Cherokee tribal citizenship and assimilate as US citizens. Their descendants reorganized in the 20th century and gained federal recognition as a tribe known as the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (named in reference to the majority of the tribe who moved west to Indian Territory in 1839.) They bought back land in what is known as Qualla Boundary, part of their traditional territory that had been ceded to the US government by other Cherokee leaders prior to removal. Their Museum of the Cherokee Indian in Cherokee, North Carolina exhibits an extensive collection of artifacts and items of historical and cultural interest, from the early Mississippian Period, of which there are remains in the area, to the Cherokee Culture brought by their migrants in the 16th and 17th centuries. They are an Iroquoian-speaking people related to those nations in the Iroquois Confederacy and other Iroquoian-speaking groups traditionally occupying territory around the Great Lakes. The Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual, located near the museum, sells traditional crafts made by its members. Founded in 1946, the Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual is country's oldest and foremost Native American crafts cooperative.Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual, Inc., Smoky Mountain Host of North Carolina (retrieved July 1, 2014) Contemporary language and religion A stickball dance on the Qualla Boundary. 1897. More than two dozen Christian churches of various denominations are located within the Qualla Boundary. Many of the traditional religious practices of the Eastern Band have, over time, blended with new age views and customs according to Cherokee traditionalists. They have diverged as the result of cultural isolation of the various factions of Cherokee society. Many traditional dances and ceremonies are still practiced by the Eastern Band. The Eastern Band has begun a language immersion program requiring all graduating high school seniors to speak the tribal language beginning 2007. Of the total population in the Qualla Boundary, there are approximately 900 speakers, 72% of whom are over the age of 50.Comprehensive Cherokee Language Survey, EBCI Dept. of Cultural Resources. Cherokee, NC. 2005. Eastern Cherokee Indian Land Trust (Qualla Boundary) Blowgun demonstration in Oconaluftee Indian Village, Cherokee, North Carolina The Eastern Cherokee Indian Nation Land, officially known as the Qualla Boundary, is located at in western North Carolina, just south of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The main part of the reserve lies in eastern Swain County and northern Jackson County, but smaller non-contiguous sections are located to the southwest in Cherokee County (Cheoah community) and Graham County (the Snowbird community). A small part of the main reservation extends eastward into Haywood County. The total land area of these parts is 213.934 km¬≤ (82.600 sq mi), with a 2000 census resident population of 8,092 persons.United States Census Bureau, Eastern Cherokee Reservation, North Carolina The Qualla Boundary is not strictly a reservation, but rather a \\"land trust\\" supervised by the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs. The land is a mere fragment of the extensive original homeland of the Cherokee Nation, which once stretched from Virginia to South Carolina and west to present-day Tennessee and Alabama. The people had to purchase their land to regain it after it was taken over by the US government through treaty cessions, which had all been negotiated by a very small percentage of assimilated Cherokees. Today the tribe earns most of its revenue from a combination of Federal/State funds, tourism, and the Harrah's Cherokee Casino, established in the early 1990s. Tourism includes many campgrounds, trails and river adventures, mountain biking, fishing, golfing, spas, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the Blue Ridge Parkway, Unto These Hills Outdoor Historical Drama, Oconaluftee Indian Village, Cherokee Botanical Garden and Nature Trail, the award-winning Museum of the Cherokee Indian, zoos, restaurants and a collection of galleries and shops representing gifted, traditional artists, such as Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual. =Gaming relations with North Carolina= In 1988, the United States Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), which allowed federally recognized tribes to establish casinos on tribal property. Under the act, tribes are limited to offer casino games that correspond to the existing level of gaming allowed under state law. North Carolina was unique in permitting the Cherokee to establish a casino offering Class III gaming in 1994, well before the state allowed a lottery. The typical pattern has been for states to offer a lottery, followed by an agreement between the state and the Indian tribe to allow establishment of a casino or other form of gambling operation.Sedgwick, Jessica. \\"This Month in North Carolina History: November 1997 ‚Äì Cherokee Casino Opens.\\" Southern Historical Collection, Wilson Library. University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. November 1997 (retrieved December 18, 2009) The first major casino in North Carolina, Harrah's Cherokee Casino (in partnership with Caesars Entertainment Corporation), was opened on Qualla Boundary, land of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in the western part of the state on November 13, 1997.North Carolina Education Lottery. \\"About Us, Introduction and Timeline.\\" Cited October 1, 2008. The casino was the result of nearly ten years of negotiations among tribal, state, and federal officials. Tribal Chief Jonathan \\"Ed\\" Taylor, North Carolina Lead Liaison and Chief Negotiator David T. McCoy, and Governor Jim Hunt developed a plan for a casino that would meet state laws and satisfy local and tribal concerns. Tribal leaders wanted to be able to offer more than bingo and other Class I forms of gambling, to attract larger crowds and generate greater revenue. The tribe had previously opened a small casino offering forms of video poker and electronic bingo. This had been challenged by the Asheville, North Carolina U.S Attorney on the grounds that the tribe was offering a form of gambling that was not legal elsewhere in North Carolina. The tribe wanted to ensure agreements with the state to prevent such problems. Since the inception of the North Carolina lottery in August 2005, Harrah‚Äôs Cherokee casino has been permitted to extend its offered games to include Class II and III gambling. As thousands of people visit Harrah‚Äôs each year and the casino‚Äôs popularity continues to increase, the economic benefits of the casino have become evident. Annually, at least $5 million of casino profits is given to the Cherokee Preservation Fund; this institution pays for projects that promote non-gambling economic development, protect the environment, and preserve Cherokee heritage and culture.\\"Cherokee casino should be granted the option other tribal casinos enjoy,\\" Asheville Citizen-Times, Asheville, North Carolina. December 12, 2005. Another portion of casino profits goes to improving tribal health-care, education, housing, etc. Part of the revenue goes to the state of North Carolina, as provided by the agreement drafted by Taylor and Hunt. In 1996, the first amendment to the compact was entered into the Federal Register, establishing the appointments of the Gaming Commission, staggered five-year terms for commissioners, and the ability to hire independent legal council upon Tribe approval. In 2001, the second amendment to the compact was entered, it raised gambling age from 18 to 21, make-up and appointments to the Gambling Commission between the Tribe and the North Carolina Governor, creation of the Cherokee Preservation Foundation, and clarification on games, prizes and gifts awarded. In 2002, an agreement of authorization was reached that allowed the Tribe to hold electronic Bingo and Raffle games. In 2011, Governor Bev Perdue and Principal Chief Michell Hicks came to an agreement on a new 30-year gaming compact. The agreement allowed live table games and grants the Tribe sole rights to provide those games west of Interstate 26. Granting the exclusivity, the Tribe had agreed to a revenue sharing agreement with the State, which will only be used for public education purposes. On September 28, 2015, the Tribe opened their second casino, Harrah's Cherokee Valley River, in Murphy, North Carolina. On July 26, 2019, Governor Roy Cooper signed Senate Bill 154 into law that permitted wagering on sports and horse racing on tribal lands.

History =Genesis= Thalamus Ltd was created in 1986 as an in-house software publishing label of British magazine publisher Newsfield Publications Ltd, to take advantage of their leading position publishing computer game magazines, such as Crash and Zzap!64, during the mid-1980s. Ex-Activision PR Manager Andrew Wright was assigned the position of Company Director and Newsfield staff writer Gary Liddon was appointed Technical Executive. The company was initially based in Canonbury, North London, in an office shared with staff of Newsfield's newly launched lifestyle magazine LM. =First titles= Thalamus capitalised on the success of the Commodore 64 gaming scene by releasing their first batch of titles on this platform. Having established numerous contacts within the C64 development scene through the popularity of their Zzap!64 gaming magazine, Thalamus were able to sign up Finnish programmer Stavros Fasoulas to develop their first three titles, Sanxion, Delta and Quedex. Sanxion was the first release to bear the Thalamus name, and it garnered a Sizzler rating from Zzap!64 - this led to accusations of favouritism from rival publication Commodore User. Rob Hubbard provided the music for the first two titles, while Matt Gray provided the music for Quedex. \\"Thalamusik\\", the loading tune that accompanied the C64 version of Sanxion proved to be so popular amongst fans that Zzap!64 later included a full synthesised version on one of their cover cassettes. The C64 version of Delta popularised the concept of the Mix-E-Load loading system. Provided as standard on the cassette versions of each game (and as a bonus on the floppy disk versions), the Mix-E-Load system allowed players to remix the loading music of the game, in real time, as the main program loaded in the background.http://www.gamesradar.com/a-celebration-of-c64-loading-screens/4/ Mix-E-Load was created by Gary Liddon in conjunction with Rob Hubbardhttp://www.gamesradar.com/a-celebration-of-c64-loading-screens/3/ and derived from an idea by Nick Pelling, author of well known BBC Micro games Frak! and Firetrack. =The staff changes= During the development of Delta, Liddon and Wright both left Thalamus, with Wright returning to Activision and Liddon pursuing a career in games programming. Ex-Electric Dreams development manager Paul Cooper was brought on board to head up the company. Stavros Fasoulas returned to Finland for National Service, so for their next release Thalamus turned to upcoming C64 programmer Martin Walker. Having already programmed the well-received C64 titles Rupert and the Toymaker's Party, Chameleon and Back to the Future, Martin Walker delivered an innovative puzzle/shooter hybrid named Hunter's Moon. Despite a favourable response from critics, the game didn't sell as well as previous Thalamus titles. In the second half of 1988, Thalamus returned from a period of relative silence with two new titles. Hawkeye marked the commercial debut of The Boys Without Brains, a Dutch collective who had already made a name for themselves within the C64 demo scene. The game was a side-scroller with colourful graphics and a soundtrack from Jeroen Tel. Armalyte was a shoot-'em-up in the spirit of R-Type, originally conceived as its own unique identity but publicised as a sequel to Delta. As the 1980s drew to a close, Thalamus continued to release C64 games, including the surreal puzzle/shooter Snare, the horizontal scroller Retrograde, from the Rowlands brothers and Heatseeker, a platform game with an environmental theme by Paul O'Malley. A brief experimentation with the ZX Spectrum format saw conversions of Sanxion and Delta being released, but by this time the Spectrum market was in decline and Thalamus decided to halt development of a number of Spectrum projects. =Final titles and dissolution= Thalamus entered the 1990s with a few more C64 titles, including Creatures and Creatures II: Torture Trouble from the Rowlands brothers, which have been lauded by several computer magazines for the strength of their gameplay and graphics on the aging machine. Cartoon-style platformers Summer Camp and Winter Camp were also released. In 1991, Newsfield ran into serious financial trouble. Newsfield were forced to halt publication of their popular gaming magazines. Europress stepped in to save the magazines, but they slowly died out over the next year or two as their respective markets dwindled. Thalamus managed to survive the liquidation of Newsfield, but funds were running low. With 8-bit gaming being superseded by 16-bit gaming, production costs were rising, forcing hundreds of independent publishers, such as Thalamus, to either close down or allow themselves to be consumed by a publishing giant. Thalamus released their final C64 game, Nobby the Aardvark in 1993.

It is large enough to contain several starships of that fictional universe, and in real life the Spacedock consisted of a series of sets, miniatures, and designs that were used for various films and television shows in the 1980s and 1990s. Written spacedock (one word), it is first seen in the 1984 theater film Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, and subsequently in the fourth, fifth, and sixth Star Trek movies. The spacedock also makes appearances in The Next Generation-era trilogy of seven season shows (TNG, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager) of the 1980s and 1990s. Space stations of this class in orbit around other places are shown many times in TNG, In this era before computer generated spacecraft, models were expensive so they were often re-used to increase efficiency of the budget. In 2015 a set of artwork printings and miniature model of the Spacedock design went to auction for over . One filming model for the interior (for spacecraft shots inside the dock) was across and was built by Industrial Light and Magic special effect makers for motion pictures and TV. This was an advanced model in an era before computer generated images became common, and it had various neon lights and doors which could open for the special effects shots. The design contained miles/kilometers of fiberoptics for lighting.Shay, 10. Earth Spacedock has a cameo of sorts, shown being under construction in Earth orbit in the season one finale of Star Trek: Discovery, a show set a decade before the original Star Trek (1966‚Äì69) in its primary science fiction universe.TrekMovie.com 10 Easter Eggs From The Season One Finale Of ‚ÄòStar Trek: Discovery‚Äô Concept and design The design was to be done away with after Search for Spock, and ILM dismantled it after that film. When it was desired to be used again for the next movie, Star Trek IV, it had to be re- assembled. The re-use of the model from the previous movie and also the re-use of interior sets depicting the station helped economize on the budget for Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, which debuted in 1986. It is one of franchise's \\"enduring spacecraft designs\\".

A virtual memorial to the real-life actors that played the cast of the original series was placed in Earth Spacedock in that computer game by the year 2015, including for actor Leonard Nimoy. Earth Spacedock is used as a starting point for missions in Star Trek: Online, as noted by the book Star Worlds: Freedom Versus Control in Online Gameworlds. In the Star Trek universe, the space docks are equipped for repairing and re-supplying, or changing personnel aboard visiting spacecraft, such as the Enterprise. The space station was designed by Industrial Light & Magic (known for Star Wars), who employed David Carson and Nilo Rodis on the project. One feature of the Spacedock design was its interior set, which included an area with large windows, outside which the Enterprise could be seen, thus allowing the Enterprise to be seen in scale compared to people, all inside the Spacedock space station. Spacedock has also been used as a plot device in Star Trek franchise novels, such as in The Star Trek: The Original Series: The Case of the Colonist's Corpse by Tony Isabella, Bob Ingersoll in which a starship returns to spacedock for repairs. Earth Spacedock is the starting point for Picard's Next Generation Enterprise journey in that series. In that narrative, the Enterprise-D leaves Earth Spacedock in the year 2364 to travel to the planet Deneb IV, where it will pick up crew including Commander Riker and host an inspection by McCoy from the original series, now a Federation Admiral. Enterprise-D was the third Galaxy class starship to leave Spacedock, the previous two were the Galaxy and the Yamato in 2357 and 2363 respectively. The Yamato is Enterprise-D sister ship, but is destroyed in the TNG episode \\"Contagion\\" (S2E11), which debuted in March 1989. The space station is often noted in encyclopedias of Star Trek Universe lore, which note the station's name as Spacedock written as one word.

For an ethnos to become a titular nation, it had to satisfy certain criteria in terms of the amount of population and compactness of its settlement. The language of a titular nation was declared an additional (after Russian) official language of the corresponding administrative unit. The notion worked well for the cases of well established, homogeneous and relatively developed nations. In a number of cases, in certain highly multiethnic regions, such as North Caucasus, the notion of a titular nation introduced intrinsic inequality between titular and non-titular nations, especially since the introduction of the \\"korenizatsiya\\" politics, according to which representatives of a titular nation were promoted to management positions.

On May 14, 1970, city and state police confronted a group of students. Shortly after midnight, the police opened fire, killing two students and injuring twelve.Review of Lynch Street: The May 1970 Slayings at Jackson State College (Tim Spofford), Review author: William M. Simpson, The Journal of Southern History, Vol. 56, No. 1. (Feb., 1990), pp. 159‚Äì160. The event happened only 11 days after the Kent State shootings, in which National Guardsmen killed four students at Kent State University in Ohio, which had first captured national attention.  Timeline  On the evening of Thursday, May 14, a group of around 100 black students had gathered on Lynch Street (named after the black Reconstruction era US Representative John R. Lynch), which bisected the campus. The students \\"were reportedly pelting rocks at white motorists driving down the main road through campus ‚Äî frequently the site of confrontations between white and black Jackson residents.\\" By 9:30 p.m. the students had started fires, thrown rocks at motorists and overturned vehicles including a large truck after a false rumor had spread of the death of Charles Evers. Firefighters who were dispatched to the scene quickly requested police support. The police responded in force. At least 75 Jackson police units from the city of Jackson and the Mississippi Highway PatrolThe Report of the President's Commission on Campus Unrest, William W.

After the firefighters had left the scene shortly before midnight, the police moved to disperse the crowd that had gathered in front of Alexander Hall, a women's dormitory. Advancing to within 50 to 100 feet (15 to 30 m) of the crowd, officers at roughly 12:05 a.m opened fire on the dormitory. The exact cause of the shooting and the moments leading up to it are unclear. Authorities say they saw a sniper on one of the building's upper floors and were being sniped at from all directions. Later, two city policemen and one state patrolman reported minor injuries from flying glass, and an FBI search for evidence of sniper fire was negative.President's Commission on Campus Unrest, pp. 442‚Äì444 The students said that they had not provoked the officers. The gunfire lasted for 30 seconds and more than 460 shots were fired by a reported 40 state highway patrolmen, who used shotguns from 30 to 50 feet. Every window on the narrow side of the building facing Lynch Street was shattered. The crowd scattered, and a number of people were trampled or cut by falling glass. Phillip Lafayette Gibbs, 21, a junior, and James Earl Green, 17, a senior and miler at nearby Jim Hill High School, were killed, and twelve others were wounded. Gibbs was killed near Alexander Hall by buckshot, and Green was killed behind the police line in front of B. F. Roberts Hall, also with a shotgun.  Aftermath  The President's Commission on Campus Unrest investigated the event and also held public hearings in Los Angeles and Washington, DC, and at Kent State. There were no arrests in connection with the deaths at Jackson State, but the Commission concluded \\"that the 28-second fusillade from police officers was an unreasonable, unjustified overreaction.... A broad barrage of gunfire in response to reported and unconfirmed sniper fire is never warranted.\\"Presidents Commission on Campus Unrest, p. 450 The university has memorialized the occurrence by naming the area of the shootings Gibbs-Green Plaza.Gibbs-Green Plaza, Jackson State, Retrieved August 15, 2009 The plaza is a large, multi-level brick and concrete patio and mall on the eastern side of the school's campus that borders J. R. Lynch Street and links Alexander Hall to the University Green. A large stone monument in front of Alexander Hall near the plaza also honors the two victims. Damage to the fa√ßade of Alexander Hall caused by the rounds fired by the police is still visible. In December 1970, a federal grand jury was discharged after it had failed to produce an indictment or written findings in a five-month recess. It had summoned about 40 state patrol men and 26 city police officers.

He was Commissioner of Police of the City of London from 1950 to 1971 and was also the first head of the Royal Ulster Constabulary to be styled Chief Constable. Young was instrumental in the creation of the post of Chief Inspector of Constabulary. In the early 1950s, he played a crucial role in policing decolonisation in the British Empire. During the 1960s, he led the way in modernising British police recruitment and in improving the training of senior officers. Early life and education Young was born at 55 Chamberlayne Road, Eastleigh, Hampshire, the third of four children of Edwin Young (1878-1936), a builder and contractor, and his wife Gertrude Mary (n√©e Brown; 1880-1945); both of his elder siblings died in childhood. He attended Mayville Preparatory School, Southsea from 1912 to 1915 and then Portsmouth Grammar School from 1915 to 1924, where he showed no particular academic aptitude but very much enjoyed the Officers' Training Corps; when in later life he returned to present prizes, he told the pupils that his parents would have been very surprised to see him in the hall on speech day because he had never come close to winning any school award. Aged sixteen, he left to join the Portsmouth Borough Police, against his family's wishes. His mother and grandmother never approved of his career choice, seeing the police as unsuitable for a young man from an aspiring middle-class family; indeed, when his maternal aunt Emma Brown married Superintendent Samuel Bowles of the Hampshire Constabulary, she made him resign. Career =Portsmouth Borough/City Police= Young's father's business partner Alderman Sir John Henry Corke (1850-1927), who served as Mayor of Portsmouth from 1912 to 1915, helped to smooth the way for Young by securing him an initial placement in the Chief Constable's office (the post of Cadet Clerk was specially created for him) in December 1924. On the advice of Thomas Davies, the Chief Constable, he first took a course in business and accountancy. Appointed a Constable in May 1925, he became the Coroner's Officer in April 1932. In June 1932, aged 25, he became the youngest Detective Sergeant in the United Kingdom, serving with the Northern Division CID. During his time there, he led investigations into murder, blackmail, fraud and arson. He headed the enquiries into the UK's first case of manslaughter arising from the use of an aeroplane. Simultaneously, he began to take an ever more prominent involvement in the many royal visits to Portsmouth; when Haile Selassie visited the dockyard in September 1937, he acted as his personal escort and French interpreter. During these years, Young was also entrusted with what he later cryptically termed \\"enquiries concerning the activities of subversive persons and propaganda, and also with other matters affecting state security\\". It was also during these years that he acquired his passion for ever better police equipment and his personal love of new gadgets. Young was promoted to Inspector in June 1937 and appointed to Portsmouth's Southern Division. In Eastney and Southsea, he gained his first taste of the complexity of the problems created by traffic, of measures to be taken for its efficient control and of the need to promote road safety. A keen motorist (who progressed from a motorcycle to a series of fast cars), he took a pragmatic approach. =Leamington Spa Borough Police= Young had risen moderately quickly and he was marked out for further advancement. His energy, tact and ability made that obvious. Nevertheless, as a non-Hendon graduate and a non-public schoolboy, his promotion over the next dozen years was meteoric for the 1930s and 1940s. Young wanted to head his own force and after one unsuccessful attempt (for the chief constableship of the Isle of Wight Constabulary), he became Acting Chief Constable of Leamington Spa Borough Police in September 1938, aged 31, at a salary of ¬£500 per annum. One year later, he was appointed to the permanent post of Chief Constable. As such, he was one of the youngest men ever to become a Chief Constable. In his first nine months in Leamington he secured an increase of twelve in the force's tiny establishment of forty-five, the first increase since 1915. He reorganised the borough's fire brigade, and, among other police innovations, set up twelve of the then new \\"police pillars\\", a network of two-way microphone handsets across the borough enabling the public to contact police stations and civil defence posts directly. The base of the pillar contained first aid equipment while, a Leamington innovation, a flashing red light on the top called up policemen on patrol. From Leamington onwards, Young possessed a marked capacity to persuade his police authority to increase its capital spending and a marked inclination to find technological help for the policeman. Seconded under the aegis of the Home Office for six months in November 1940 to Coventry after its blitz to run the city's police because the Chief Constable was fully occupied as Civil Defence Controller, he introduced there the \\"good neighbour scheme\\" for bombed out civilians that he had trialled in Leamington and which was later adopted nationally by the Home Office. =Birmingham City Police= Leamington's was a very small force and for a year his command was only \\"acting\\" so, from the start, Young was looking for a permanent as well as a larger command. After several unsuccessful applications (the East Riding of Yorkshire Constabulary in 1939, Portsmouth City Police in 1940, Oxford City Police in 1940), in September 1941 he was selected from a short-list of six as Senior Assistant Chief Constable of Birmingham City Police, then the second-largest police force in the UK; the salary was ¬£1,000 p.a. His particular responsibilities - training and communications - played to his strengths. It was in Birmingham that he began to experiment with police training. Learning by example and by demonstration is common now, but in 1941 it raised eyebrows and caught the approving eye of the Home Office. He also made Birmingham the foremost British force in the use of police wireless by establishing in 1942 a \\"duplex\\" ultra high-frequency two-way radio telephone system linking every police station and every police car. =Wartime service= The war overtook Young's career again in February 1943 when he was one of a number of chief constables seconded to the War Office's Civil Affairs Training Centre and attended the first course for senior officers. Before the course was finished, he was transferred to the instructing staff and in June 1943 he was appointed the first commandant of the new Police Civil Affairs Training Centre at Peel House in London (gazetted with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel) and charged with the task of setting up the training school for policemen and provost officers who would maintain law and order in Axis territory as it was liberated by advancing Allied forces. Barely was that centre up and running and its first students through their course when Young found himself a Colonel and moved from the classroom in July 1943 to be Senior British Police Officer in the Mediterranean Theatre, stationed in North Africa awaiting the invasion of Sicily. Ashore on day two of the invasion, Young became Director of Public Safety in the first functioning Allied military government - the Allied Control Commission for Italy. In December 1943 he was given the additional role of Director of Security, responsible directly to the Commander-in-Chief for hunting saboteurs and enemy agents as well as the removal of fascist officials from public offices. In Italy, Young now commanded not just British officers but the 120,000 men of the entire Italian police and had responsibility for all Italian prisons, fire brigades and civil defence. The models Young developed in Italy were later applied across Allied occupied Europe in 1944-1945, but his proudest achievement was the restoration and reorganisation of the Carabinieri, with whom he maintained an association for the rest of his life. He fell in love with Italy, returning regularly and frequently holidaying in Positano and visiting his wartime friend Colonel Alfredo \\"Freddy\\" Zanchino of the Carabinieri. =Hertfordshire Constabulary= Appointed Chief Constable of Hertfordshire Constabulary in 1944 (but released from the army only in April 1945), Young now commanded an establishment of 515 at a salary of ¬£1,290. Still aged only 38, he had twenty-one years of experience of small, medium and large city and borough forces. From Hertfordshire, he set the pace in revitalising long-debilitated county police forces, pushing his police authority to fund major expenditure on officers' pay and conditions. Police housing was one of the outstanding issues of the time. Young persuaded his police authority to fund a building programme that in six years would provide a police house for every married man in the county force; the design and equipping of these houses was agreed between the county architects and a \\"housing committee\\", recruited through the county Police Federation, not only of men of all ranks but, at Young's insistence, of officers' wives. In 1946, he wrote: :\\"I hold the view that the police organisation is not a police force but a police service, which offers to the right individual not merely a job but all the advantages of a professional career. I believe in doing everything reasonably possible by way of improving the conditions and amenities for all ranks of the service, and in particular in delegating both authority and responsibility to officers according to their rank. Having done this I am prepared to accept nothing but the highest standard of service by way of return.\\" At the same time, he persuaded his authority to fund major capital spending to sustain modern police efficiency. The Home Office authorised Hertfordshire to be the first force after the war to introduce a wireless system, one which Young adapted for rural circumstance from his Birmingham model. To make it as effective as possible, the Home Office accepted his proposal that the wireless network needed to be set up for a larger area than one county so the neighbouring county force of Bedfordshire was added. Almost simultaneously, Young was appointed by the Home Office to a committee chaired by Sir Percy Sillitoe, Chief Constable of Kent, to consider the wireless needs of all forces. Young's action plan for the co-ordination and standardisation of all inter-force communications was rapidly accepted. His Hertfordshire years also saw the beginnings of a professional relationship with James Callaghan. They already knew each other from Portsmouth, where their mothers had both worked at Agnes Weston's Sailors Rest; Callaghan had tried unsuccessfully to court his sister, Eileen. Callaghan was now a junior minister at the Ministry of Transport. They met up with each other again on a road safety committee and became working allies to extend speed restrictions and improve road markings; cat's eyes were perhaps the most significant fruit of their labours. They worked together again when Callaghan was Home Secretary and it was Callaghan who selected Young to go to Ulster in 1969 to implement the Hunt Report. =Metropolitan Police= Hertfordshire showed that Young wanted to be a chief police officer who made things happen. Ever ambitious, he applied unsuccessfully to be chief constable of Kent in 1946, but his next job was offered to him. So impressed was Home Secretary James Chuter Ede with the young Chief Constable of Hertfordshire that in 1947 he appointed Young to the vacant post of Assistant Commissioner \\"D\\" of the Metropolitan Police in London, in charge of organisation, recruitment, training and communications. To bring in an outsider to such a rank in the Met was unprecedented. The Home Secretary realised that the nation's police forces were wedded to obsolete methods and needed the invigorating shake-up that the young chief constable had already delivered in Hertfordshire; Scotland Yard must not be left out. Things, however, did not go well. The Commissioner, Sir Harold Scott, tolerated him (although he was an outsider too), but senior colleagues cold- shouldered him. Within \\"D\\" Department, Young delivered all the Home Secretary had hoped for, a success that only alienated the hierarchy even further. =City of London Police= The first former constable to be appointed Commissioner of Police of the City of London, in March 1950, Young entrenched there his reputation as \\"the policeman's policeman\\". Improved pay and conditions and professional standards remained his constant pre-occupations. The police under his command found him forceful but gracious, intolerant of failings in himself as well as others. In all his forces, he was renowned for his popularity with all ranks under his command. Young came to love the City of London. He relished command of a force small enough to know every constable well. He enjoyed the City's rich social life too, and he much valued the invitation to join the Goldsmiths Company. The police needed to recruit and with considerable success he set about making service more attractive. Pay and allowances were increased, housing modernised, and catering improved. Uniforms were made more comfortable and practical. At another level, he pushed through changes in career structures. He engineered a national recruitment revolution in the British police, running command courses and seeing through a fast-track entry scheme to attract graduates - and for many years he was director of extended interviews for the Senior Command Course that he had founded. These and other changes were designed to facilitate the promotion of talent. Young realised that the police could no longer rely on habits little changed for a century. He fought for the recruitment and promotion of women. He resisted the well-ingrained tradition of parachuting senior officers from the armed forces into police commands; and only with great reluctance did he give in to the demand from the Hertfordshire police committee that he use his wartime military rank. He sternly opposed Lord Trenchard's officer-class philosophy as wholly inappropriate for the British police service. Rather, he was wedded to Sir Robert Peel's intention that the police be \\"filled from the bottom up\\". The young man whose own family had thought that being a policeman was far from suitable dedicated his own long career to making the police a respected and attractive profession. Young's lobby of the 1960 Royal Commission on the Police overcame Home Office objections to a strengthened police inspectorate, although Sir Charles Cunningham blocked Young's selection as inaugural Chief Inspector of Constabulary. =Royal Ulster Constabulary= In November 1969 (until 1970) Young was seconded to be the last Inspector-General and the first Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. James Callaghan, then Home Secretary, sent him to implement the Hunt Report, which introduced the standard British rank system for police officers in Northern Ireland and disbanded the controversial Ulster Special Constabulary. =Other positions= He chaired the Police Council for the UK, the Association of Chief Police Officers training centres committee and the education committee of the National Police Fund. He was a governor of the Police College and of Atlantic College, and a member of the committees of the Police Advisory Board, the National Police Fund, the Royal Humane Society, the National Rifle Association, the National Scout Council, and the Thames Group Hospitals. He was President of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) in 1962. =Colonial police reforms= One distinctive feature of Young's career was as a police reformer in colonial hotspots. Young was sent on four such missions. First came a short period in the Gold Coast in 1950 preparing the blueprint for the role of the police as the colony was being prepared to become the first British territory in Africa to be granted independence. Then in 1952-1953, Young was seconded to the Federation of Malaya to be Commissioner of Police during the Emergency. In 1954, Young was asked to undertake a second secondment in the UK's troubled colonies - this time in Kenya as Commissioner of Police during Mau Mau. However he resigned after less than eight months, allegedly because he disapproved of the way in which some of the rebels were mistreated. Personal life Brought up in a household with strong Anglican evangelical beliefs (the family attended St Jude's, Southsea for matins and evensong every Sunday as well as week-day meetings), experiencing Portsmouth's slums and docks as a young constable had an effect on Young. Guided by his curate, the Reverend Frederick Dillistone, later Dean of Liverpool, he decided that he must seek ordination. The Bishop of Portsmouth, Neville Lovett, however, rejected his application to attend theological college, telling him at interview that \\"policemen do not become priests\\". Although later in life Young would drift away from regular worship, the impact of Portsmouth on his world-view never shifted. Shocked by the poverty and injustice which he discovered, Young became a staunch Christian socialist and, very rare for a chief constable, a lifelong Labour Party voter. Throughout his career, he sought out contact with clergymen and in the later 1960s, encouraged by the Bishop of London, again considered Anglican ordination. Young married three times. On 11 April 1939, at Boarhunt parish church, Hampshire, he married Ivy Ada May Hammond (born 20 December 1909), a nurse from the Royal Portsmouth Hospital whom he had courted for years - custom then dictated lengthy engagements and police pay then was very low. She died of cancer on 14 September 1956. They had one son, Christopher John Young, born in 1941. Young married Mrs Margaret Furnival Homan, n√©e Dolphin, in 1957. The marriage fell apart quickly and they separated. She committed suicide in Malta in 1966. On 16 April 1970, he married Mrs Ileen Fryer Turner (n√©e Rayner, born 19 April 1914), whom he had known since she was his police driver in Birmingham during the war and who at one time had been the mistress of his great friend Sir Edward Dodd, Chief Constable of Birmingham and later Chief Inspector of Constabulary. She died on 31 December 2002. Thrice widowed, Young died at St Thomas's Hospital, London, on 20 January 1979. After cremation his ashes were scattered at Beachy Head. Honours Young's career made him the most decorated policeman of his era. Young was awarded the King's Police Medal (KPM) in the 1952 New Year Honours. The following year, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1953 Coronation Honours \\"for services as Commissioner of Police, Federation of Malaya.\\" and was further appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in the 1962 Birthday Honours. He was knighted in the 1965 Birthday Honours, and was formally conferred with his knighthood by the Queen at Buckingham Palace on 16 November of that year. For his work in Northern Ireland he was again knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1971 New Year Honours. 100px 100px 100px 100px 100px 100px 100px 100px 100px 100px 100px 100px 100px 100px 100px =British= *1937 King George VI Coronation Medal *1939-45 1939-1945 Star *1939-45 Italy Star *1939-45 Defence Medal *1939-45 War Medal *1951 Officer of the Order of St John (OStJ) *1952 King's Police Medal for Distinguished Service *1953 General Service Medal (bar for Malaya) *1953 Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) *1953 Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal *1954 Africa General Service Medal (bar for Kenya & oak palm for mention in despatches) *1962 Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) *1965 Knight Bachelor *1971 Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (Civil Division) (KBE) * Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal =Foreign= *Argentina: Commander, Order of Merit *Austria: Commander, Honour Badge for Merit of the Republic (Silbernes Ehrenzeichen) *Belgium: Commander, Order of the Crown. *Cameroons: Officer, Order of Valour *Chile: Commander, Order of Merit *Denmark: Commander, Order of the Dannebrog. *Finland: Commander, Order of the White Rose;

It is one of the museums within National Museums Scotland. The museum is housed in the original wartime buildings of RAF East Fortune which is a well preserved World War II airfield. As a result of this the entire site is a scheduled ancient monument with no permanent structures added by the museum. The hangars, control tower and stores were designated as Category B listed buildings by Historic Scotland, but this designation was removed in 2013 as they were already covered by the stricter scheduling. Museum history RAF- era buildings at the museum airfield The collections date back to 1909 when the Royal Scottish Museum acquired Percy Pilcher's Hawk glider. This was the first aircraft collected by any museum in the United Kingdom. The same year the museum acquired models of the Wright Model A and Bl√©riot XI. During the early 1920s several aero engines were added to the collection, including a 1910 33 hp Wright engine donated by Orville Wright. In 1968 a Slingsby Gull sailplane was acquired. In 1971 the museum was given a Supermarine Spitfire XVI by the Ministry of Defence. This could not be displayed in Edinburgh and was stored in a hangar at East Fortune. The following year a Hawker Sea Hawk, de Havilland Sea Vampire and de Havilland Sea Venom were received from RNAS Lossiemouth. The growth in the aircraft collection led to the decision to open a Museum of Flight at East Fortune, with the public admitted for the first time on 7 July 1975.Storer, JD (1983). \\"The Founding of the Museum of Flight\\", in Bunyan, IT, Storer, JD and Thompson, CL (1983). East Fortune: Museum of Flight and History of the Airfield, Royal Scottish Museum. The displays included several aircraft on loan, including de Havilland Dragon Rapide (G-ADAH), BA Swallow (G-AEVZ) and Fairey Delta 2 WG774.Benzies, AR (1975). Scotland Scanned 75, Central Scotland Aviation Group. In 1979 a temporary exhibition about the R34 airship was mounted, followed by Fighters of the RFC and RAF, 1914 to 1940 the following year. The 1981 temporary exhibition was The Flight of Rudolf Hess 1941.Storer, (1983). Boeing 707 cockpit The museum expanded significantly in 1981 as a result of the sale by auction of much of the Strathallan Collection of aircraft. The museum purchased five aircraft (Bristol Fairchild Bolingbroke, de Havilland Dragon, de Havilland Puss Moth, General Aircraft Cygnet and Percival Provost). Of these, the Cygnet and Provost were the first aircraft to make their final flights to join the museum. That same year, the de Havilland Comet also flew in to the museum, as did the Avro Vulcan in 1984. Another significant expansion took place with the donation of much of the British Airways Collection of aircraft in 2006. This collection was previously displayed at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford. The museum acquired the BAC 1-11, Vickers Viscount, Boeing 707 forward fuselage and Hawker Siddeley Trident cockpit. Visitors are able to walk through the 1-11 and 707 and look into the flight deck of the Trident. This is in addition to walking through the de Havilland Comet and Jetstream 31 fuselage which were already in the museum collections. A ¬£3.6million project, completed in 2016, installed heating and insulation for the first time to two hangars that were built in 1940. Collections The museum collections have expanded into one of the most important in the UK, covering all aspects of aviation including military, civil and recreational. The museum is significant in that it is the only UK national museum still collecting the history of commercial aviation. This resulted in the museum putting their Boeing 707 fuselage section on display from April 2010, with a collection of BOAC crew and passenger artefacts, including a 1960s stewardess uniform. A list of the aircraft in the collection is given on the museum website. The aircraft on display are: * Aero S-103 (613677), Czechoslovakian licence-built version of the MiG-15 * A√©rospatiale-BAC Concorde G-BOAA.

It was the first experiment to make large, high-fidelity images of the CMB temperature anisotropies, and is best known for the discovery in 2000 that the geometry of the universe is close to flat, with similar results from the competing MAXIMA experiment. By using a telescope which flew at over 42,000 meters high, it was possible to reduce the atmospheric absorption of microwaves to a minimum. This allowed massive cost reduction compared to a satellite probe, though only a tiny part of the sky could be scanned. The first was a test flight over North America in 1997. In the two subsequent flights in 1998 and 2003 the balloon was launched from McMurdo Station in the Antarctic. It was carried by the Polar vortex winds in a circle around the South Pole, returning after two weeks. From this phenomenon the telescope took its name. The BOOMERanG team was led by Andrew E. Lange of Caltech and Paolo de Bernardis of the University of Rome La Sapienza. Instrumentation The experiment uses bolometers for radiation detection. These bolometers are kept at a temperature of 0.27 kelvin. At this temperature the material has a very low heat capacity according to the Debye law, thus incoming microwave light will cause a large temperature change, proportional to the intensity of the incoming waves, which is measured with sensitive thermometers. An off-axis 1.3-meter primary mirror focuses the microwaves onto the focal plane, which consist of 16 horns. These horns, operating at 145 GHz, 245 GHz and 345 GHz, are arranged into 8 pixels. Only a tiny fraction of the sky can be seen concurrently, so the telescope must rotate to scan the whole field of view. Results CMB Anisotropy measured by BOOMERanG Together with experiments like the Saskatoon experiment, TOCO, MAXIMA, and others, the BOOMERanG data from 1997 and 1998 determined the angular diameter distance to the surface of last scattering with high precision. When combined with complementary data regarding the value of Hubble's constant, the Boomerang data determined the geometry of the Universe to be flat, supporting the supernova evidence for the existence of dark energy. The 2003 flight of Boomerang resulted in extremely high signal-to-noise ratio maps of the CMB temperature anisotropy, and a measurement of the polarization of the CMB.

In solution, the process proceeds with intra- and intermolecular energy transfer. The excess energy of the excited vibrational mode is transferred to the kinetic modes in the same molecule or to the surrounding molecules. Through this process, the initially excited vibrational mode moves to a vibrational state of a lower energy. The relaxation is called the longitudinal relaxation, and the time constant of the relaxation is called the longitudinal relaxation time, or T1. Vibrational energy relaxation has been studied with time-resolved spectroscopy. By the excitation of the pump pulse, the population distribution of the vibrationally excited state is made by infrared absorption or a Raman process when the molecule is in the electronic ground state. In addition, by the electronic transition, the molecule often moves to the vibrationally excited state of the electronic excited state. The process of the energy relaxation from these vibrationally excited states can be observed with the probe pulse, which is delayed from the pump pulse.

In 1958 it became Nelson's first US No. 1 and the Billboard Hot 100's first No. 1. At age 18, Sheeley was the youngest woman to write an American number-one hit. Jerry Capehart, the manager and songwriting partner of Eddie Cochran, then agreed to look after Sheeley's interests, and she and Cochran began a relationship. She wrote \\"Love Again\\" and \\"Cherished Memories\\" for Cochran, and the 1959 hit \\"Somethin' Else\\" with Eddie's brother Bob Cochran. Her other songwriting credits included \\"Hurry Up\\", recorded by Ritchie Valens. In April 1960 she traveled to England to join Cochran and Gene Vincent, who were touring there. She and Cochran were reported as being \\"unofficially engaged\\". She recorded a song, \\"Homework\\", with producer Jack Good. On the night of April 16, 1960, Sheeley, Vincent, and Cochran were traveling in a private hire taxi from a concert in Bristol to London Heathrow Airport when it slammed into a lamp post near Chippenham, Wiltshire. All three were rushed to hospital. Cochran, who had been thrown from the vehicle, suffered fatal brain injuries and died the next day, at the age of 21. Sheeley suffered a broken pelvis, and Vincent broke his ribs and collarbone and added further damage to his already weak leg. It was later determined that the accident was due to the driver's excessive speed. Following the accident she returned to the USA, where she collaborated with musician-songwriter Jackie DeShannon on a string of hits, including Brenda Lee's \\"Dum Dum\\" and \\"Heart in Hand\\", The Fleetwoods' \\"He's The Great Imposter\\", and Irma Thomas's \\"Breakaway\\". She also co-wrote songs with Chris Curtis of The Searchers, including \\"Night Time\\" recorded by Paul and Barry Ryan. In 1961 she married Los Angeles disc jockey Jimmy O'Neill. They created the ABC-TV series Shindig! (1964‚Äì1966). They divorced five years later, but remained friends. After her divorce, she moved away from the music scene, apart from some public appearances at Cochran conventions in the 1990s. In August 2000, RPM Records released a collection of her songs that were recorded in the early 1960s by session musicians, including Glen Campbell, Delaney Bramlett, Leon Russell, David Gates, Hal Blaine and Herb Alpert. Death Five days after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage, Sheeley died on May 17, 2002, at Sherman Oaks Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles at the age of 62. Media In 1988, Levi Strauss & Co. promoted their Levi's 501 range with a television commercial called \\"Eddie Cochran\\", directed by Syd Macartney. It told the story of how Sheeley (played by actress Sharon Devlin) attracted Cochran at a party by wearing said product. It was seemingly narrated by Sheeley and the background song, \\"C'mon Everybody\\", was released as a promotional single, followed by a compilation album of Cochran's hits. Sheeley was depicted by Rosanna Locke in the 1987 film La Bamba.

He was the Official Secretary to the Governor-General of Australia between 1973 and 1990, in which capacity he served Sir Paul Hasluck, Sir John Kerr, Sir Zelman Cowen, Sir Ninian Stephen and Bill Hayden.Vice-Regal secretary appointed Early life Smith was born in Melbourne to Polish immigrant parents named Szmitkowski, and was educated at Princes Hill State School, Scotch College, the University of Melbourne, and the Australian National University, where he gained a Bachelor of Arts. Smith began his career in the Australian Public Service in 1953, and was later appointed as Private Secretary to the Minister for Interior and Works from 1958 until 1963. He was then appointed Secretary to the Federal Executive Council and head of the Government Branch, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, from 1971 to 1973. Secretary to the Governor-General In January 1973, Smith was appointed Acting Official Secretary to Sir Paul Hasluck, and on 20 July was made permanent. He later became the first Secretary of the Order of Australia on its establishment in 1975. After Hasluck's retirement, Smith then served Sir John Kerr and was present at the time of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis. Following the dismissal of the Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, on 11 November 1975, Smith read out the proclamation of the dissolution of parliament on the steps of the then Parliament House in Canberra: After Smith read the proclamation, Whitlam spoke to the large crowd that had gathered and indirectly referred to David Smith: Smith served as Official Secretary until 1990, serving Sir Zelman Cowen, Sir Ninian Stephen and Bill Hayden. He was later appointed a Visiting Fellow in the Faculty of Law at the Australian National University for 1998 and 1999, and was a member of the 1998 Constitutional Convention. Views on the monarchy and Whitlam's dismissal In a lecture on \\"An Australian Head of State: An Historical and Contemporary Perspective\\", published as Papers on Parliament No. 27, March 1996,Sir David Smith \\"An Australian Head of State: An Historical and Contemporary Perspective [1]\\" Papers on Parliament No. 27, March 1996 Smith mentioned that, in a previous lecture, Senator Baden Teague had spoken of the Queen as Australians' head of state and argued for her replacement by an Australian head of state, and that in his replies to questions after the lecture Teague had spoken of the Governor-General as \\"our head of state\\". Smith remarked that the switch from Queen to Governor‚ÄëGeneral was \\"entirely automatic and unselfconscious\\", and that Teague was \\"not alone in his ambivalence\\". After mentioning other public references made to the governor -general as head of state, Smith opined \\"The fact is that under our Constitution we have two heads of state‚Äîa symbolic head of state in the Sovereign, and a constitutional head of state in the Governor-General\\", and said that in his lecture he would discuss the roles of the Sovereign and of the Governor-General under the Australian Constitution, including some of the changes which had occurred in each of those roles since Federation. To conclude the lecture Smith quoted the remarks of Gerard Brennan, Chief Justice of Australia, on the oaths of allegiance and office: : \\"The first promise is a commitment of loyalty to Her Majesty the Queen, her heirs and successors according to law. It is a commitment to the head of State under the Constitution. It is from the Constitution that the Oath of Allegiance, which has its origins in feudal England, takes its significance in the present day. As the Constitution can now be abrogated or amended only by the Australian people in whom, therefore, the ultimate sovereignty of the nation resides, the Oath of Allegiance and the undertaking to serve the head of State as Chief Justice are a promise of fidelity and service to the Australian people. The duties which the oath imposes sit lightly on a citizen of the nation which the Constitution summoned into being and which it sustains. Allegiance to a young, free and confident nation, governed by the rule of law, is not a burden but a privilege.\\" (Spoken at a ceremonial sitting of the High Court on 21 April 1995) After retiring from public service, Sir David became a member of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy and frequently gives addresses on constitutional matters. He is an ardent defender of Sir John Kerr, and highly critical of Gough Whitlam. In 2005 Smith published an account of the events of 1975 and the other constitutional debates, Head of State, which was launched by former Governor-General Bill Hayden. Smith later published his opinion that the dismissal had been the culmination of a political and not a constitutional crisis.David Flint, Dispelling the myths in News Weekly, 18 February 2006 Governor-general as head of state Smith has, since his retirement in 1992, argued publicly in books and lectures that the governor-general carries out the duties of head of state in his own right and not as the Queen's representative or surrogate.Speech by Sir David Smith at a Luncheon for Australians for Constitutional Monarchy Parliament House, Sydney 19 March 2001. He notes that between 1992 and 1999, in part of Bill Hayden's time as Governor-General, the Commonwealth Government Directory listed the function of that office in these terms: \\"Under the Constitution the Governor-General is the Head of State in whom the Executive Power of the Commonwealth is vested.\\" Smith noted that in 2009, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd described the Governor- General as the Australian head of state, by saying, \\"A visit to Africa of this scale by Australia's Head of State will express the seriousness of Australia's commitment\\". Life in retirement Smith lives in Canberra and can often be found at Old Parliament House leading guided tours. He is father to three sons, Michael (financial services, Sydney), Richard (Commonwealth public servant, Canberra), Phillip (strategic architect, ICT, Oslo, Norway). Honours *On 29 April 1977, Smith was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) for his continuing service as Official Secretary. *On 9 June 1986, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for \\"service to the Crown, as Official Secretary to the Governor-General and as Secretary of the Order of Australia\\". *On 19 August 1990, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) at a private investiture at Balmoral Castle. *On 1 January 2001 he was awarded the Centenary Medal for \\"services to Australian society through the Office of the Governor-General\\". Smith has also been appointed a Knight of the Order of St John and awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal. See also *Australian head of state References Further reading * Smith, David.

It is the sequel to Rival Schools: United By Fate and was first released as an arcade game in 2000 and ported to the Dreamcast in 2001. Gameplay Project Justice's fighting system is lifted from the original Rival Schools, with some notable changes. The game continues to be a team fighter, but has teams of three characters instead of two. This allows another Team-Up attack to be used in a fight, but also adds a new type of attack, the Party-Up, initiated by pressing any three attack buttons. The Party-Up is a three-person attack that varies based on what school the character initiating the attack is from. The additional partner also allows players to cancel an opponent's Team-Up Special by inputting a Team-Up command of their own. This initiates a short fighting sequence between one character from each team. If the person initiating the sequence gets the first successful hit in during the sequence before time runs out, the Team-Up they are caught in will be canceled, and the game switches back to the main fight; if the opposing player gets the first hit or time runs out, the Team-Up continues as usual. Additionally, the 'vigor' meter in Project Justice is limited to 5 levels (down from 9 in Rival Schools), with Party-Ups requiring all 5 levels, Team-Ups continuing to cost two levels, and any attempts (successful or not) to cancel a Team-Up costing one level. Also carrying over from the first game, the Dreamcast port of Project Justice in Japan includes a character creation mode that allows a player to create their own fighters who can be used in all modes except for single-player. However, the character creation in Project Justice is packaged as a board game, taking place during an inter-school festival, rather than a date sim game like in Rival Schools. As with School Life Mode in the original Rival Schools, though, this boardgame is not included in non-Japanese ports of Project Justice due to the amount of time it would take to translate the mode. Instead, several unlockable sub- characters were included in these ports, built from the character creation parts in the Japanese version. =Style= As in the original game many of the characters use their chosen field of academic or sporting excellence as a fighting style. As a result, special moves - in particular the Two-Person team up moves - tend to have a surreal edge, with methods to injure your opponent ranging from: forcing them to take part in an impromptu bout of synchronised swimming (on dry land) (if Nagare is in your team); confusing them by taking photographs of them in rapid succession during an interview for the school newspaper (if Ran is in your team), or even berating them so severely that they fall unconscious out of shame. Project Justice's single player mode was structured differently from its predecessor. While Rival Schools only plays a story if characters from the same school were selected, the game instead has separate Story and Free modes. *In Story Mode, players select a portion of story grouped by school and play through a rigid storyline with a limited group of 2 to 6 characters that the player can choose from for each fight. Like the original game, each fight in story mode is accompanied with 2D cut scenes that advance the story. In some stories, the plot will branch out depending on the results of certain fights or decisions made by the player, changing the fights that the player faces. After fighting the boss of the game, an ending for the school's story is shown. *In Free Mode, players select a team of three characters and fight random teams of opponents until getting to fight the boss, similar to selecting two characters from different schools in Rival Schools. After defeating the boss, the player is shown a screen where the game rates the performance of player, and gives them a ranking named after a character from the game. Plot One year has passed since the events of Rival Schools: United By Fate and that things have gone back to normal in Aoharu City. Batsu Ichimonji, Hinata Wakaba, Kyosuke Kagami, and the rest of the fighters had resumed their normal school lives and that all of them had enjoyed the calm peace that came after their last adventure, but the peace itself doesn't last for long and that the fighters would soon find themselves getting involved in a new struggle. Kurow Kirishima: a cold-hearted and ruthless ninja assassin from a mysterious group known only as the \\"Reverse Society\\" has his sight set on the Imawano family and plans to eliminate them and their allies so that he can prepare for the advancement of his own ambition to rule Japan. To this end, he attacks Raizo Imawano: the principal of Justice High and father to Batsu, so that he can easily put him out of commission and not have any interference come from him.

Lastly, Kurow himself plans to destroy Batsu's reputation by disguising himself as Batsu's doppelganger (named Vatsu) so that he can attack the fighters and make them believe that Batsu is behind it. Batsu and his friends must fight back against the evil plot of Kurow and attempt to not let their friendship get destroyed by the conspiracy of a deadly ninja assassin. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Project Justice on their January 15, 2001 issue as being the most-successful arcade game of the year. The Dreamcast version received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 33 out of 40. Game Informer gave the Japanese version an average review, while GamePro gave it universal acclaim, both of them a few months before its U.S. release date. Chester Barber of Next Generation said of the same Japanese version, \\"Unless you're hard-up for a new fighter, you may want to rent it before making a purchase.\\" References External links  Category:2000 video games Category:3D fighting games Category:Arcade games Category:Capcom games Category:Dreamcast games Category:Fighting games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games about ninja Category:Rival Schools Category:Versus fighting games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games with AI-versus-AI modes ja:„Ç∏„É£„Çπ„ÉÜ„Ç£„ÇπÂ≠¶Âúí ","title":"Project Justice"},{"id":"1147872","text":"Stavros S Niarchos.

It is also known as a gallant or garrant sail. Later full rigged ships split the topsail (and often the topgallant sail) for easier handling. They thus fly two topsails (and possibly two topgallant sails) per mast. The lower topgallant sail is immediately above the upper topsail. The upper or only topgallant sail is set from the top of the topgallant mast, if there is a lower topgallant it is set from midway down the topgallant mast.

History Vedomosti was founded as a joint venture between Dow Jones, who publishes The Wall Street Journal; Pearson, who previously published the Financial Times; and Independent Media, who publishes The Moscow Times. Independent Media was acquired by Finnish media company Sanoma in 2005. Sanoma sold its stake in the paper to , former chief executive of Kommersant, in April 2015. Ahead of a new Russian media ownership law prohibiting foreign enterprises from owning more than 20% of Russian media companies, Dow Jones and Pearson also divested their stakes in 2015 to Kudryavtsev, who held the right of first refusal. In March 2020, Kudryavtsev and his partners, Boris Berezovsky associate Vladimir Voronov and former News Corp executive Martin Pompadour, announced their intention to sell Vedomosti to two buyers: publisher of Nasha Versiya Konstantin Zyatkov and managing director of Arbat Capital Alexei Golubovich. Former editor-in-chief Tatiana Lysova criticized the sale, saying that the buyers were \\"alien to Vedomosti‚Äôs rules and ideals.\\" The following month, the sale was put on hold amid accusations of censorship under editor-in-chief Andrey Shmarov. Shmarov reportedly deleted articles critical of Rosneft's head, Igor Sechin, and banned articles critical of Putin's proposed constitutional changes. According to an investigation by Meduza, Arkan Investment, Vedomostis parent company, had taken out a loan of from Rosneft's subsidiary the Russian Regional Development Bank (RRDB) to pay off a previous loan from the Russian state-owned bank Gazprombank which was used to buy Vedomosti in 2015. The investigation also alleged that Rosneft spokesperson Mikhail Leontyev was involved in both the selection of Shmarov as editor-in-chief and in negotiating the sale of the paper. Kudryavtsev confirmed the loan, but claims the loan was not used to buy Vedomosti. On 29 May 2020, Vedomosti was sold to businessman Ivan Yeremin via his holding company Sapport. On 15 June 2020, five senior editors resigned from Vedomosti in protest to Shmarov's confirmation to editor-in-chief by the paper's board of directors.

History =1960s= The first regional television stations were launched five years after the rollout of television to metropolitan Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. GLV-10 in Traralgon opened on 9 December 1961 and was followed 14 days later by GMV-6 in Shepparton and BCV-8 Bendigo. Television continued to expand throughout Victoria and the rest of the country throughout the 1960s with no fewer than twenty five stations making their first transmissions between 1962 and 1968. 1962 station openings *4 March: NBN-3 Newcastle *17 March: CBN-8 Orange *18 March: WIN-4 Wollongong *27 April: BTV-6 Ballarat *12 May: RTN-8 Lismore *26 May: TNT-9 Launceston *2 June: CTC-7 Canberra *13 July: DDQ-10 Toowoomba *1 November: TNQ-7 Townsville 1963 station opening *7 September: RTQ-7 Rockhampton 1964 station openings *19 June: RVN-2 Wagga Wagga *7 September: AMV-4 Wodonga/Albury 1965 station openings *23 January: NRN-11 Coffs Harbour *10 April: WBQ-8 Wide Bay/Maryborough (later SEQ-8) *10 April: NEN-9 Tamworth *27 November: STV-8 Mildura *1 December: CWN-6 Dubbo (a relay of CBN-8 Orange) *15 December: MTN-9 Griffith 1966 station openings *25 March: SES-8 Mount Gambier *27 May: ECN-8 Taree *7 September: FNQ-10 Cairns 1967 station opening *10 March: BTW-3 Bunbury 1968 station openings *1 March: GTS-4 Port Pirie *9 August: MVQ-6 Mackay *16 August: BKN-7 Broken Hill Many of the first stations produced their own local programming, supplemented to content from the capital city stations such as GTV-9 Melbourne's In Melbourne Tonight. GLV-10 Traralgon was amongst the first to make use of live 'off-air' relays of programmes from metropolitan stations without the use of video recording equipment. =1970s= VEW-8 Kalgoorlie opened on 18 June 1971 and ITQ-8 Mount Isa commenced on 11 September 1971 before television reached the Northern Territory on 11 November 1971 with the launch of NTD-8 Darwin. The last regional stations to launch were GSW-9 Albany (a relay of BTW-3 Bunbury) on 29 August 1974, RTS-5A Loxton on 26 November 1976 and GTW-11 Geraldton on 21 January 1977. Similar to their metropolitan counterparts, various stations began to form programming and operational partnerships in order to reduce operating costs and share the cost of imported programming.

ECN later went into partnership with NEN-9 Tamworth. All television stations in Australia, including regional stations, were required to convert to colour transmission in 1975. =1980s= Stations continued to form various partnerships and networks throughout the 1980s. North Queensland Television (later QTV) * TNQ-7 Townsville * FNQ-10 Cairns SIX Network Victoria (later Television Victoria) * GMV-6 Shepparton * BTV-6 Ballarat * STV-8 Mildura (joined network after purchase by Ent Ltd.)

These included GLV-10 in Gippsland, who moved to channel 8 in order to allow ATV-0 Melbourne to move to channel 10 in 1980. DDQ-10 and TVQ-0 switched channels to become DDQ-0 and TVQ-10, and SEQ10 became SEQ55 in 1988. The last regional station to launch before aggregation launched unofficially on 2 January 1988 ‚Äì IMP-9, Imparja Television in Alice Springs, began transmission via the AUSSAT satellites, as well as a number of terrestrial transmitters. Aggregation The Hawke Labor government of the 1980s introduced a system of regional equalisation, known as aggregation, which would provide regional viewers with the same viewing choice as their metropolitan counterparts. Local stations protested at this proposal, arguing that their profits would fall, and that local output would also decrease. They offered their own proposal, whereby the existing operator would be allowed to operate relays of the other two networks, allowing a combination of both viewer choice and local programming. If NBN were to take the Nine affiliation, for example, their two relays would offer programs from the Seven and Ten networks, direct from Sydney. This proposal was, however, rejected. The new system would allow stations to transmit into neighbouring markets, as an affiliate of one of the three metropolitan networks. For instance, before aggregation, there were three separate licence areas in northern New South Wales ‚Äì Newcastle, New England, and the Mid North Coast, each served by a single commercial station. After aggregation, these three licence areas merged, with the three stations in direct competition for viewers. Soon after realising they had lost their battle with the government, the stations began to organise affiliations with metro networks. Stations that hadn't joined forces beforehand began to merge and form new networks: Vision TV (later Star Television) * RTQ-7 Rockhampton * DDQ-0 Toowoomba Prime Television (later Prime7) * CWN-6 Dubbo (previously part of MidState Television) * CBN-8 Orange (previously part of MidState Television) * MTN-9 Griffith (previously part of MidState Television, split from network in 1989 to affiliate with WIN Television) * RVN-2 Wagga Wagga (previously part of RVN-AMV) * AMV-4 Albury-Wodonga (previously part of RVN-AMV) Sunshine Television Network (callsign STQ) * SEQ-8 Maryborough * MVQ-6 Mackay Southern New South Wales was the first area to be formed, in two phases (as a result of problems in Orange and Wagga), starting on 31 March 1989. WIN Television Wollongong (WIN-4) became an affiliate of the Nine Network, The Prime Network became a Seven affiliate, and Capital Television in Canberra became a Network Ten affiliate. The next area to be aggregated was Queensland, which took place on 31 December 1990. QTV was to become a Nine affiliate, Star Television a Network Ten affiliate, and the Sunshine Television Network a Seven affiliate. However, in the week before aggregation was due to take place, WIN Television bought Star Television and gave them the Nine affiliation ‚Äì meaning that QTV was forced to change its affiliation to Network Ten. The next year, northern New South Wales was aggregated. NBN Television became the Nine Network affiliate, while the Seven Network would be carried by Prime7, formerly carried by 9-8 Television. Northern Rivers Television (NRTV) became the Network Ten affiliate. At one stage, WIN made its first attempt in setting up a northern New South Wales outlet by replicating the steal it had made in Regional Queensland. WIN tried to buy NRTV through bidding to steal the Nine affiliation rights from NBN, and force the latter to pick up the Ten affiliation. However, nothing came out of the deal and the respective affiliations remained as is among stations until today. Aggregation in Victoria took place between 1992 and 1993. VIC TV (later WIN) became a Nine Network affiliate, Prime Television the Seven affiliate, and SCN the Ten affiliate. Tasmania was aggregated in 1994, albeit with only two stations ‚Äì Southern Cross is a dual Seven and Ten affiliate, while TAS TV took programming from the Nine Network. Remote and Central Australia was the final area to be aggregated ‚Äì one of the largest geographical licence areas, taking in parts of the Northern Territory, western Queensland, the north west of South Australia, and other areas in which terrestrial television signals cannot be received. Stations broadcast to this area mainly through satellite or re-transmission stations. Imparja Television, based in Alice Springs, became a dual Nine and Ten affiliate, while Seven Central, based in Mount Isa, became a Seven affiliate. A number of areas were not aggregated, due to their small size and relative inability to support more than one commercial station ‚Äì these included Griffith, Mildura, Darwin and regional Western Australia. =1990s= Throughout the 1990s, a number of changes relating to local programming and identity began to take place ‚Äì the first of which was to occur for NRTV, bought out by QTV's owners, Telecasters Australia in 1993. Soon after, both stations took on generic Network Ten branding with the name Ten Northern New South Wales and Ten Queensland. Local news services were also axed in most of these areas with the exception of Townsville and Cairns. Similarly, the Southern Cross Network in Victoria changed its name and logo to a pseudo-Ten SCN design. The same network later axed local news services and changed its name to Ten Victoria, in line with moves taken by the Telecasters Australia-owned stations in New South Wales and Queensland. NBN Television made similar moves in 1994, when it launched a new logo based on that of the Nine Network at the time. Sunshine Television was purchased by the Seven Network in 1995 and became nearly identical to the network's metropolitan stations under the name Seven Queensland. A second commercial licence was made available for single-licence areas such as Mildura, Griffith, and Darwin. Incumbent stations were permitted to apply for the new licence under Section 73 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, however only if the Australian Broadcasting Authority, at the time, felt that there was no other operator who would be interested or able to operate a new station in the area. The ABA initially denied all three stations the ability to operate the new licences. A joint complaint to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against the ABA and Imparja Television in 1996 found in favour of MTN-9 but against the other incumbent stations. In both the Darwin and Mildura cases, it was determined that Imparja satisfied the ABA's criteria of being in a position to run a second service in the area. Prime Television's applications in both Griffith and Mildura, for the purposes of the appeal, were rejected on the grounds of insufficient local coverage. When the auction process ended in late 1996, however, Prime was awarded the Mildura licence for $3.2 million, and commenced broadcasting with the callsign PTV-32 in 1997. Telecasters Australia launched Seven Darwin using TND-34 in the same year, followed a $2.1 million bid for the licence. In the same year, an amendment was made to the Broadcasting Services Act affirming the ability of existing broadcasters in one and two commercial station markets to apply for \\"supplementary licences\\". These new licences allowed either a single incumbent or group of incumbents working together to run an additional channel. In the then-single station markets, applying existing broadcasters gained both analog and digital licences for a new channel. In two station markets, the two existing broadcasters were allowed to form joint ventures to later bid for digital-only licences following the introduction of digital terrestrial television in Australia in 2001. The new licences were known as section 38A and 38B licences, respectively, after the relevant sections in the Broadcasting Services Act. Remote Central and Eastern Australia remains the only licence area without one of these stations either proposed or currently available. The name \\"Section 38A\\" refers to the applicable section of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 which grants such rights to solus operators.Broadcasting Services Act 1992: Sect 38A Additional commercial television licences in single markets. Retrieved from AustLII on 11 September 2007. Using its Section 38A licence, MTN-9 was able to begin their supplementary service in 1997 using the callsign AMN-31. The new station carried almost all of sister Prime7 station CBN-8's Prime programming with the exception of local news and major sporting events broadcast by Network Ten. This was allocated on 1996-07-18,Australian Communications and Media Authority.

Retrieved on 11 September 2007. and went to air in 1997, after being initially rejected by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. It is a feed of the Central West NSW station of Prime Television, and is licensed as AMN, broadcasting on UHF 31. A second licence for remote Western Australia, one of the last remaining solus markets, was put up for auction in 1998. WIN Television won the ability to broadcast to the entire regional Western Australia market (as opposed to GWN, which held separate licences in various areas), and subsequently launched its new station WOW in 1999. In the same year, WIN purchased Griffith affiliate MTN-9, as well as SES-8 Mount Gambier and RTS-5a Riverland. =2000s-2010= In 2000 Southern Cross Broadcasting bought out both Telecasters Australia and Central GTS/BKN, subsequently removing any remaining local references, and rebranding its new stations with the 'Southern Cross' name. Supplementary licences were also issued to SCB and WIN in parts of regional South Australia and Broken Hill, while at the same time, local programming was cut. The remote Eastern and remote Central licence areas were also merged at this time, amongst the last to be aggregated. The solus operators in the regional licence areas of South Australia have been granted an 38A licence, being allocated on 2002-04-24. * Spencer Gulf/Broken Hill: Central GTS/BKN, owned by Southern Cross Broadcasting was granted callsigns SGS and SCN, and branded as Southern Cross Ten, carrying Network Ten programming. * Renmark/Loxton and Mount Gambier: WIN Television South Australia, owners of existing stations SES-8 and RTS-5A, was granted callsigns LRS and MGS, branded as WIN Ten, carrying Ten Network programming. In more recent years, the premise has been extended to allow for two station markets where there are two different owners to apply, either separately or jointly, to operate a digital-only third station. These are known as \\"Section 38B\\" licences,Broadcasting Services Act 1992: Sect 38B Additional commercial television licences in 2-station markets. Retrieved from AustLII on 11 September 2007. and were created by the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Act 2000.Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Act 2000. Retrieved from AustLII on 11 September 2007. Section 38B allows current operators to apply for the additional licence either as a joint venture company, or separately; in the case where both operators apply separately to ACMA, the licence is to be allocated via auction. However, as of 2007 all of the licences so far granted under section 38B have been to joint ventures between existing operators. These licences were awarded to Tasmania (Tasmanian Digital Television, owned by WIN and Southern Cross), Mildura (Mildura Digital Television, owned by WIN and Prime), and Darwin (Darwin Digital Television, owned by PBL Media and Southern Cross). The axing of local news services by Prime7 and Southern Cross Broadcasting in Newcastle, Wollongong, Queensland, Darwin and remote Central & Eastern Australia triggered a review of local content regulations by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. The ABA later ruled, in 2003, that a minimum level of local content should be provided in the four largest regional licence areas. Prime and Southern Cross responded to this by launching two-minute bulletins for all affected regions from areas in which local news was already produced, as well as in Southern Cross Ten's case the current affairs program State Focus, and on Prime, a Saturday morning children's programme Saturday Club. In December 2003, the first digital-only commercial television station was launched, Tasmanian Digital Television, operating on a supplementary licence owned jointly by WIN Television and Southern Cross. Similarly, Mildura Digital Television (a similar joint venture between WIN and Prime) began broadcasting in 2006 to Mildura, offering exclusive Ten-based programming for the first time in the area. It is a direct feed of Ten Melbourne with local advertising. Darwin Digital Television opened transmission on 28 April 2008. During April 2007, SP Telemedia announced that it would consider selling NBN Television, and had received at least two bids, one each from WIN (in its second attempt of entering the northern NSW market) and Nine Network's owner PBL Media. On 9 May 2007, PBL Media's (now Nine Entertainment Co.) A$250 million bid became final, winning the sale. However, upon acquiring NBN, PBL continued to operate it as a regional independent station until it was folded into the main Nine Network in July 2016 as a result of the regional affiliation switch between WIN Corporation and Southern Cross Austereo. The purchase also secured permanent status of supplying Nine's content to the station's entire coverage area, sparing any future affiliation switches. =2010s-present= After Nine launched its new online catch-up video on demand and live streaming service 9Now on 27 January 2016, WIN filed a lawsuit against Nine, claiming that live streaming into regional areas breaches their affiliation agreement. Justice Hammerschlag of the NSW Supreme Court dismissed the case on 28 April 2016, citing that \\"live streaming is not broadcasting within the meaning of the PSA (program supply agreement), and that Nine is under no express or implied obligation not to do it.\\" Following WIN's defeat in the 9Now lawsuit, Nine announced it had signed a new $500 million affiliation deal with Network Ten affiliate Southern Cross Austereo, switching its primary Nine affiliation to stations currently affiliated with Ten in Southern NSW, ACT, and regional areas in Victoria and Queensland on 1 July 2016. As an affiliation fee to Nine, SCA will pay 50 percent of its revenue to the network. With that announcement, WIN was effectively stripped of its 27-year partnership with Nine. In response, WIN entered affiliation talks with Network Ten, reaching a final agreement on 23 May 2016. Under the new agreement, beginning 1 July 2016, WIN would carry Ten programming into regional Queensland, Southern NSW, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. Deals to supply Nine programming to South Australia, and Griffith were secured on 29 June 2016, a day later Tasmania were secured as well. A supply deal for Western Australia joint venture West Digital Television was not secured before the 1 July 2016 deadline, but a deal was later finalised on 2 July 2016 with programming resuming that night. In late January 2017, it was announced that Southern Cross had entered into negotiations with WIN Corporation, owners of regional Ten-affiliate WIN Television, over the sale of NRN in exchange for WIN's Wollongong radio station i98FM. This deal would have expanded WIN's television coverage across all regional markets in the eastern states and granted Southern Cross radio coverage in Wollongong. Southern Cross later withdrew from negotiations on 20 February 2017 with no explanation given. However, WIN and Southern Cross later finalised an agreement where they would sell NRN to WIN for a total of $55 million, with the sale taking effect on 31 May 2017. WIN, which had its third attempt for a NNSW outlet successful since 1991, maintained the station as Ten Northern NSW until playout and transmission were transferred to Mediahub on 1 September 2017, at which point the station adopted the WIN branding. Channel numbers were reshuffled to align with WIN's other stations; but as Nine owned NBN Television holds the 8 numbered digital channels, NRN's channels remained on the 5 numbered channels. Broadcasting =Three-station Markets= The majority of these licence areas are on the more densely populated east coast, in which three commercial stations are each affiliated to the Seven Network, Nine Network and Network Ten from their respective capital cities. In addition to these, digital television channels from ABC Television and SBS Television are also available. The majority of these areas were aggregated in the early 1990s. The following are current affiliates as of 1 July 2016. Northern New South Wales * Prime7 (Seven) * Nine Network (Nine) * WIN Television (Ten) Southern New South Wales & ACT * Prime7 (Seven) * Southern Cross Nine (Nine) * WIN Television (Ten) Regional Victoria * Prime7 (Seven) * Southern Cross Nine (Nine) * WIN Television (Ten) Regional Queensland * Seven Queensland (Seven) * Southern Cross Nine (Nine) * WIN Television (Ten) =Areas with supplementary licences= These licence areas are not as heavily populated as the main markets listed above. Consequently, only two broadcasters operate in these areas, with a jointly owned supplementary service that provides the services of the remaining network. These supplementary services are italicised. ABC Television and SBS Television services are also available regardless, throughout these areas. Tasmania * Southern Cross Tasmania (Seven) * Tasmanian Digital Television (Nine) * WIN Television (Ten) Mildura/Sunraysia, Victoria (includes surrounding border regions of New South Wales) * Prime7 (Seven) * Mildura Digital Television (Nine) * WIN Television (Ten) Darwin, Northern Territory * Southern Cross Darwin (Seven) * Nine Darwin (Nine owned and operated) * Darwin Digital Television (Ten) Regional and Remote Western Australia * GWN7 (Seven) * West Digital Television (Nine) * WIN Television (Ten) Remote Eastern and Central Australia * Southern Cross Central (Seven) * Imparja Television (Nine) * Central Digital Television (Ten) Monopoly areas Similarly to the jointly owned supplementary services provided in the above markets, in markets where only one broadcaster operates, the broadcaster will provide two regular network services, with the remaining network provided as a supplementary service. Griffith/MIA, New South Wales (WIN Corporation monopoly) * Seven Griffith (Seven) * Nine Griffith (Nine) * WIN Television (Ten) South-Eastern South Australia and the Riverland (WIN Corporation monopoly) * Seven SA (Seven) * Nine SA (Nine) * WIN Television (Ten) Spencer Gulf, South Australia/Broken Hill, New South Wales (Southern Cross Austereo monopoly) * Southern Cross GTS/BKN (Seven) * Nine GDS/BDN (Nine) * Ten SGS/SCN (Ten) Programming 1: Network feed. 2: State feed. 3: Local feed. 4: Programming aired on a television station Each commercial network (both regional and metropolitan) can be seen as being composed of three layers, with some exceptions. The first is the \\"national feed\\" ‚Äì content that is broadcast to the entire country, more-or-less at the same time (accounting for time zones and minor rescheduling). This category is composed of nearly all the non-news programs and sometimes station promotions and branding. The second is the \\"state feed\\", content that is broadcast to the entire state or territory. It comprises mainly state news, as well as current affairs programs and station promotions. This is usually the case in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. The third is the \\"local feed\\", content broadcast to a specific market, such as local news and advertising. =Original Programming= In order to fulfil regulations put in place by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, the majority of regional networks are required to provide original, locally targeted output such as news, current affairs, or children's programmes. WIN Television, Australia's largest regional network, produces a number of programs including sports magazine show Fishing Australia, cooking show Alive and Cooking, and travel shows Destinations and Postcards Australia. Southern Cross Television in Tasmania airs Hook, Line and Sinker alongside a range of other regional programs. Up until its full merger with Channel Seven, Both Prime and GWN produce their own versions of The Saturday Club. Prime also produces country music show A Little Bit of Country as well as an agricultural news program, On the Land. Prime 7/GWN7 currently show just Seven programming. Imparja Television also produce various local indigenous programs, as well as Yamba's Playtime, a daily show for pre-school children. Most Imparja-produced programming is also shown on National Indigenous Television. =News= ACMA regulations have, since 2003, required stations to provide minimum levels of local news and other content. * WIN Television produces half-hour WIN News bulletins for twelve regional markets, airing at 6pm on weeknights. The network also produces All Australian News, composed of stories from WIN's regional bulletins. In nine markets, short news updates are broadcast throughout the day, generally to fulfill local content quotas. * Nine-owned NBN produces an hour-long program, NBN News, containing local, national and international news, sport and weather for its entire coverage area, airing nightly at 6:00pm. NBN News is considered as the only mainland regional station to produce a one-hour news bulletin 365 days a year. As part of the nightly bulletin, the station produces local opt-outs for each of its six sub- regions. * Prime7 produces half-hour bulletins in five markets in New South Wales and Victoria; as well as in Western Australia under the GWN7 News banner. In other areas, Prime7 produces short updates to fulfill quota requirements. * Seven Queensland produces half-hour bulletins in each of its seven coverage areas (Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Central Queensland, Darling Downs, Wide Bay‚ÄìBurnett and the Sunshine Coast). *The Brisbane stations of Nine and Seven both produce half-hour bulletins for the Gold Coast at 5:30pm, airing as an opt-out on the respective station's Gold Coast transmitters. * Southern Cross Television in Tasmania produces Nightly News, a nightly hour- long bulletin incorporating local, national & international news, and a 30-minute local bulletin on weeknights for the Spencer Gulf/Broken Hill area of South Australia. For the remote central and eastern Australia licence area, Southern Cross Central and Imparja Television both air short news updates each weekday. * Southern Cross Nine airs hour-long state-based editions of Nine News in Queensland, Southern New South Wales, the ACT, Victoria and Darwin each weeknight, incorporating local, national and international stories. The three editions contain opt-outs for local news, sport and weather in fourteen markets. In most cases, newsroom staff including reporters, camera crews and producers are based in newsrooms within the coverage area though the news program itself may be presented and broadcast from studios outside the region. For example, news staff for Seven's Mackay bulletin is based in the city with the program presented from studios in Maroochydore. =Scheduling= The majority of programming in regional areas is shown at the same time as its metropolitan counterpart, with some exceptions, mainly for local news programs. Prior to the 2016 media shakeup, A Current Affair was shown at 7.30pm rather than 7.00pm in most WIN regions via then-HD multichannel GEM (Tasmania and markets without a WIN News bulletin received the programme in its original timeslot on the main channel). NBN had aired the program on delay at 7pm until the expansion of Nine's metropolitan local bulletins in January 2014, allowing the station to air ACA at the same time as in Sydney. Prime7 had aired Seven News on delay at 6.30pm in markets that receive full local bulletins at 6.00pm until the major expansion of Seven's metropolitan local bulletins in February 2014, allowing the stations to extend both the Prime7 bulletins at the same time as in Sydney and Melbourne. In its current format, full bulletin markets served by stations CBN and NEN receive the Prime7 News hour composed of the usual local news bulletin at 6.00pm, followed by Prime7 News at 6.30, a live statewide bulletin covering national stories that are shown on Seven News in metropolitan markets; AMV transmitters in the Albury and NSW/Victoria border areas receive a delayed shortened first segment of Seven News Melbourne at 6.30pm after Prime7 Local News at 6.00pm, then switches back to the live Melbourne feed for sport and weather. Prior to the development of digital television broadcasting, many dual-network affiliates, such as WIN WA, broadcast a mix of programming from two networks at differing times of the week. Prior to the full merge with Seven, Prime and GWN choose to replace nearly all Seven Network programs between midnight and 6am with infomercials, along with Southern Cross Ten, which also replaces some morning programs with infomercials. Prior to 2016, NBN Television opted to air classic programs (The Sullivans), its own Today Extra program until 2007 and infomercials in place of Nine's Morning News.

It took place on a peninsula alongside the Tigris River near Balad, Iraq. Conducted by members of Task Force Ironhorse, US forces sought to eliminate Ba'ath Party members, paramilitary, and other subversive units. Specifically, US Forces were to hit five objectives simultaneously, detain the targets and screen them for intelligence. The operation Attacking from helicopters, small boats and in armored vehicles, American forces set up road blocks and began a large raid that included over one thousand soldiers who quickly captured 397 suspects. Among those who were targeted for capture were two persons on the 'Most Wanted List': Major General Abul Ali Jasmin, the former Minister of Defense, and Brigadier General Abdullah Ali Jasmin, former head of the military academy. However, none of the targets were at the objectives. Of the 397 initially detained, most were released within days of the operation. On the last day of the operation, a force of Iraqi insurgents attacked a patrol from the 4th Infantry Division, which was involved in the operation. The insurgents fired rocket-propelled grenades at the 4th Infantry Division tank patrol. The tanks returned fire, killing four attackers and forcing the others to flee. Later, backed by Apache helicopters, the U.S. forces pursued the remaining attackers, killing another 23.

It is produced from Global's national news centre in Burnaby, British Columbia, with Dawna Friesen and Robin Gill anchoring the weekday and weekend editions respectively. From 2008 to 2010, the program was the only Canadian network newscast to be regularly anchored from the nation's capital, Ottawa. In addition to Global's owned-and-operated stations (O&Os;), Global National also airs on affiliate CHFD-DT in Thunder Bay, Ontario and independent station CJON-DT in St. John's, Newfoundland. Global also produced a Mandarin version of the newscast, titled Global National Mandarin from 2012-2016. It was anchored by Carol Wang. The newscast was seen on Shaw Multicultural Channel in Vancouver, British Columbia and Calgary, Alberta. History Global's first tentative steps towards a national news presence came in 1994 with the launch of First National, a regional newscast presented by Peter Kent which was aired in Manitoba, Ontario and (starting in 1997) Quebec. Around the same time, the rival WIC television station group launched Canada Tonight, a newscast produced at WIC's Vancouver station British Columbia Television (BCTV), and also aired on its stations in Alberta and Ontario. Following the purchase of WIC's Television stations by Global's then- parent company Canwest, Global announced in January 2001 its plans to launch a new network newscast in September of that year, with Kevin Newman returning to Canada from ABC News as the newscast's chief anchor. First National ended production in February, and the Global stations which had aired that program broadcast Canada Tonight in its place until the new newscast launched. The final broadcast of Canada Tonight aired on August 31, 2001, and the new newscast, titled Global National, debuted on September 3 from a renovated studio at CHAN, which became a Global O&O; two days earlier and produces its local newscasts from the same studio. As part of the deal in which Global bought CHAN, it became home to Global's national news centre; the station had wanted to do a national newscast for several years. Kevin Newman's name was added to the program's title from the start of its second season. The program initially only aired on weekdays; weekend broadcasts began on February 26, 2005, with Tara Nelson as the anchor.Alex Strachan, \\"Global National takes on a seven-day work week: Familiar faces will be on weekend broadcasts\\". National Post, February 22, 2005. The launch of the weekend editions precipitated the cancellation of the newsmagazine series Global Sunday. Global National initially aired in different time slots across the country: 5:30 pm in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba; 6:30 pm in Ontario and Quebec; and 11:15 pm in the Maritimes. In conjunction with the launch of Global's new visual identity in February 2006, the program began to be aired live at 6:30 pm in the Atlantic Time Zone.Global News Brings Canadian Audiences Enhanced National / Local Suppertime News Package , Global Television press release, February 1, 2006. This version of the program is then broadcast via satellite tape delay in time zones to the west (at 6:30 Eastern, 5:30 Central, Mountain, and Pacific, and 6:00 on CHBC Kelowna since 2009), with updates if news events warrant. This allows the newscast to air at a uniform time slot across most of the country, as well as to serve as a lead-in to local news in most markets. While strong in Western Canada from day one - particularly in British Columbia, where CHAN has dominated news ratings for four decades - the timeslot change allowed the program's ratings in Ontario to improve significantly as a result of having The Young and the Restless as its lead-in; that show had previously given a strong ratings bump to CIII's local newscast. (On October 11, 2011, CIII moved Global National back to 6:30 p.m. as part of a scheduling shift with its early evening newscast, News Hour.) Global National opening used from February 2006-September 2010. Despite having fewer reporters and being a latecomer to national news in Canada, Global National has come to rival its competitors at CTV National News and CBC's The National in both awards and ratings. During most weeks since the timeslot change in February 2006, Global National had ranked as Canada's most-watched national newscast according to the Bureau of Broadcast Measurement. This is with the caveat that only initial airings from Monday to Friday are compared; CTV still leads on a seven-day basis. In February 2008, Newman began presenting the weekday edition of Global National from a specially-built digital newsroom and studio facility in Ottawa. The Ottawa studio's cameras were controlled remotely from CHAN-TV in Vancouver, British Columbia where the newscast's main editorial and production staff remain. Similar remote-controlled greenscreen studios were introduced at a number of local Global newscasts. Tara Nelson was named Global's Europe bureau chief in September 2008; her position as the program's weekend anchor was then shared by Carolyn Jarvis on Saturdays and Robin Gill on Sundays. Nelson resigned in October 2010 to become the new 6:00 pm anchor at CTV Calgary, Alberta (CFCN-DT). Newman announced his departure from the network on April 30, 2010, and anchored the newscast for the last time on August 20, 2010. Dawna Friesen was named as his successor on July 13, 2010, and began anchoring Global National on September 20, 2010.L. Scrivener, Dawna Friesen: From shy prairie girl to Global News anchor, Toronto Star, September 20, 2010. Carolyn Jarvis was reassigned to Global's newsmagazine program 16:9 in 2011, with Robin Gill taking over as Saturday anchor alongside her pre-existing Sunday hosting duties. Global National Mandarin Global National Mandarin was a newscast aired on the Shaw Multicultural Channel in Vancouver and Calgary. On December 6, 2011, Global announced its plans to launch Global National Mandarin (Global National ÂõΩËØ≠Êñ∞Èóª). The 30-minute Mandarin newscast debuted on January 23, 2012, with Carol Wang as anchor. It was announced on June 29, 2016 that Global National Mandarin would air its final broadcast on June 30 as it did not garner the viewership necessary to continue airing. The investigative documentary series 16x9 was also cancelled at this time. Features Global National was the first mainstream Canadian newscast to be released as a podcast. In 2006, the download was expanded to include video for playback on a video iPod.

At age 17, he became the youngest nationally syndicated columnist in the United States. He writes columns for Creators Syndicate, Newsweek, and Ami Magazine, serves as editor emeritus for The Daily Wire, which he founded, and hosts The Ben Shapiro Show, a daily political podcast and live radio show. An editor-at-large of Breitbart News between 2012 and 2016, he has written eleven books, the first being Brainwashed: How Universities Indoctrinate America's Youth (2004) and the latest being How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps (2020).Shapiro, Ben (2020). How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps. Description & preview (via arrow keys or scrolling). Harper Collins ().  Early life  Shapiro was born in Los Angeles, California to an Orthodox Jewish family of Russian-Jewish and Lithuanian-Jewish ancestry. He developed a talent for violin at a young age, having performed at the Israel Bonds Banquet in 1996 at twelve years of age. His parents both worked in Hollywood. His mother was an executive of a TV company and his father worked as a composer. Skipping two grades (third and ninth), Shapiro went from Walter Reed Middle School to Yeshiva University High School of Los Angeles where he graduated in 2000 at age 16. He graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2004, at age 20, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and then cum laude from Harvard Law School in 2007. He then worked at the law offices of Goodwin Procter. , he ran an independent legal consultancy firm, Benjamin Shapiro Legal Consulting, in Los Angeles. Career =Author= Shapiro became interested in politics at a young age. He started a nationally syndicated column when he was 17 and had written two books by age 21. In his first book Brainwashed: How Universities Indoctrinate America's Youth (2004), Shapiro argues that students are not exposed to a variety of viewpoints at universities and that those who do not have strong opinions will be overwhelmed by an atmosphere dominated by liberal instructors even if discussion is encouraged in classrooms. In 2011, HarperCollins published Shapiro's fourth book, Primetime Propaganda: The True Hollywood Story of How the Left Took Over Your TV, in which Shapiro argues that Hollywood has a left- wing agenda that it actively promotes through prime-time entertainment programming. In the book, the producers of Happy Days and M*A*S*H say they pursued a pro-pacifist, anti-Vietnam-War agenda in those series. The same year Primetime Propaganda came out, Shapiro became a fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center. In 2013, Threshold Editions published Shapiro's fifth book, Bullies: How the Left's Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences Americans. In 2019, Shapiro published the book The Right Side of History: How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great which focuses on the importance of Judeo- Christian values and laments the decline of those values in modern America. In a May 2019 interview on BBC where Shapiro was promoting his book, the interviewer Andrew Neil suggested that Shapiro's history of remarks were inconsistent with the message of the book. Shapiro took offense to the questioning, accused Neil (a prominent British conservative journalist) of being a leftist, said Neil was trying to make a \\"quick buck...off of the fact that I'm popular and no one has ever heard of you\\", and stormed out of the interview. Shapiro later said that he had been \\"destroyed\\" by Neil, commenting on Twitter that he \\"[had broken his] own rule, and wasn't properly prepared\\". =Columnist= In 2012, Shapiro became editor-at-large of Breitbart News, a conservative website founded by Andrew Breitbart. In March 2016, Shapiro resigned from his position as editor-at-large of Breitbart News following what he characterized as the website's lack of support for reporter Michelle Fields in response to her alleged assault by Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump's former campaign manager in spite of video and eyewitness evidence of the assault. In his resignation statement, Shapiro stated that \\"Steve Bannon is a bully\\", Donald Trump is a bully, and that Bannon had \\"shaped the company into Trump's personal Pravda\\". After Shapiro's departure, Breitbart published a piece, falsely attributed to Shapiro's father's pseudonym, saying \\"Ben Shapiro betrays loyal Breitbart readers in pursuit of Fox News contributorship\\", which Breitbart later deleted. After leaving Breitbart News, Shapiro was a frequent target of antisemitic rhetoric from the alt-right. According to a 2016 analysis by the Anti-Defamation League, Shapiro was the most frequent target of antisemitic tweets against journalists. On February 7, 2013, Shapiro published an article citing unspecified Senate sources who said that a group named \\"Friends of Hamas\\" was among foreign contributors to the political campaign of Chuck Hagel, a former U.S. Senator awaiting confirmation as Secretary of Defense as a nominee of President Barack Obama, but weeks later Slate reporter David Weigel reported there was no evidence such a group existed. Shapiro told Weigel that the story he published was \\"the entirety of the information [he] had.\\" On October 7, 2013, Shapiro and business partner Jeremy Boreing co-founded TruthRevolt, a U.S. media watchdog and activism website, in association with the David Horowitz Freedom Center. TruthRevolt ceased operations in March 2018. = Host = In 2012, Shapiro joined KRLA-AM 870 as a host on their morning radio program alongside Heidi Harris and Brian Whitman. By 2016, he was one of the hosts for KRLA's The Morning Answer, a conservative radio show. Internal emails showed that Shapiro faced pressure from Salem Media executives, the syndicate that owned the show, to be more supportive of Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election. Shapiro however remained highly critical of Trump throughout the election. Shapiro and Boreing founded The Daily Wire on September 21, 2015. He serves as editor emeritus as well as the host of his online political podcast The Ben Shapiro Show, broadcast every weekday. , the podcast was ranked by Podtrac as the second most popular podcast in the U.S. Westwood One began syndicating The Ben Shapiro Show podcast to radio in April 2018. In 2018, Politico described the podcast as \\"massively popular\\". In January 2019, Westwood One expanded Shapiro's one-hour podcast-to-radio program, adding a nationally syndicated two-hour live radio show, for three hours of Ben Shapiro programming daily. As of March 2019, according to Westwood One, The Ben Shapiro Show is being carried by more than 200 stations, including in nine of the top ten markets. In June 2020, Shapiro stepped down from his role as editor-in-chief, which he had held since the site's founding, and took on the role of editor emeritus. In September 2018, Shapiro started hosting The Ben Shapiro Election Special on Fox News. The limited-run series covered news and issues relating to the 2018 midterm elections. Shapiro has made frequent appearances on PragerU with talks on intersectionality and Hollywood with 4,900,000 to 8,400,000 views . = Speaker = Shapiro speaks at college campuses across the United States. In his speeches, he often presents a conservative viewpoint on controversial subjects. He spoke at 37 campuses between early 2016 and late 2017. Some students and faculty members at California State University, Los Angeles objected to a speech that Shapiro, who was then an editor at Breitbart News, was scheduled to hold at the university on February 25, 2016, titled \\"When Diversity Becomes a Problem\\". University president William Covino canceled the speech three days before it was to take place, with the intention of rescheduling it so that the event could feature various viewpoints on the subject of campus diversity. Covino ultimately reversed his decision, allowing the speech to go on as planned. The day of the speech, student protesters formed human chains, blocking the doors to the event, and staging sit-in protests. When Shapiro began his speech, a protester pulled the fire alarm. After the speech ended, Shapiro was escorted out by campus police. Young America's Foundation announced it was filing a lawsuit against the university (with Shapiro as one of the plaintiffs), claiming that the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the students were violated by Covino's attempted cancellation of the event, as well as the physical barricading of students from entering or leaving the event. In August 2016, DePaul University revoked an invitation for Shapiro to address students at the school and barred him from entering the campus due to \\"security concerns.\\" On September 14, 2017, Shapiro gave a speech at the invitation of the University of California, Berkeley, student organization, Berkeley College Republicans, in which he criticized identity politics. The event involved a large police presence which had been promised by Berkeley Chancellor Carol T. Christ in her August letter that supported free speech. Together, the university and the city of Berkeley spent $600,000 on police and security for the event, which transpired with nine arrests but no major incidents.  Views  = 2016 presidential election = Shapiro supported Ted Cruz in the 2016 presidential election and opposed Donald Trump's candidacy. He called Steve Bannon a \\"bully\\" who \\"sold out Breitbart founder Andrew Breitbart's mission in order to back another bully, Donald Trump.\\" Not voting for Trump or Clinton in 2016, Shapiro has suggested that the election of Trump was more a vote against Hillary Clinton than a vote in favor of Trump. = 2020 presidential election = On October 19, 2020, Shapiro announced he was voting for Trump in the 2020 United States presidential election: \\"There are three reasons I'm going to vote for Donald Trump in 2020 when I didn't four years ago: First, I was simply wrong about Donald Trump on policy. Second, I wasn't really wrong about Donald Trump on character, but whatever damage he was going to do has already been done, and it's not going to help if I don't vote for him this time. And third, and most importantly: The Democrats have lost their fucking minds.\\" = Abortion = Shapiro speaking at the 2018 Young Women's Leadership Summit in Dallas, Texas. Shapiro supports a ban on abortion, including in cases of rape and incest, with one exception: when competent medical authority determines that the life of the mother is in jeopardy as a result of the pregnancy. He has further clarified that this includes extreme cases of mental illness where the life of the mother is at risk due to suicide. He also believes that doctors who perform abortions should be prosecuted. He has referred to women who have abortions as \\"baby killers\\". In 2019, Shapiro asserted that \\"the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade\\" was \\"not going to happen\\", and added that he had \\"serious doubts\\" about \\"whether the Supreme Court, as currently constituted, would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade\\". In 2019, Shapiro spoke at the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C., where he said abortion is a \\"violent act\\". =Alt-right= Shapiro is a critic of the alt-right movement, stating in 2017, \\"It is a garbage movement composed of garbage ideas. It has nothing to do with constitutional conservatism.\\" = Facebook = In 2018, Shapiro argued that Facebook was targeting conservative sites after the platform implemented an algorithm change, limiting their traffic, and that they are not transparent enough. = Gun ownership = Following the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Shapiro appeared on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight on January 10, 2013. On the issue of gun control, Shapiro called Piers Morgan a \\"bully\\" who \\"tends to demonize people who differ from you politically by standing on the graves of the children of Sandy Hook, saying they don't seem to care enough about the dead kids.\\" Videos of the encounter quickly received millions of views and went viral. Writing in October 2017, in the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, Shapiro argued that \\"banning all guns would be unwise as well as immoral,\\" but \\"we must balance the need and right to firearms with public policy concerns, including the risk that a machine gun will be used in public.\\" Shapiro suggested that policy makers \\"should look at ways of enforcing federal laws banning the sale of guns to the mentally ill.\\" =Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict= In 2003, Shapiro published a column demanding that Israel \\"transfer the Palestinians and the Israeli-Arabs from Judea, Samaria, Gaza and Israel proper.\\" Citing expulsion of Germans after World War II as a precedent, Shapiro insisted that \\"expelling a hostile population is a commonly-used and generally effective way of preventing violent entanglements.\\" In the same article, Shapiro said that \\"The ideology of the Palestinian population is indistinguishable from that of the terrorist leadership.\\" Jeffrey Goldberg was highly critical of these comments and cited them as an example of Shapiro's \\"fascist\\" behavior. Shapiro later reversed his view on the West Bank issue, saying it was \\"both inhumane and impractical\\". Vox describes Shapiro as a polarizing figure, in part due to tweets such as \\"Israelis like to build. Arabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage\\" (2010). Shapiro supported Israel's settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank. Shapiro is a longtime opponent of the two-state solution. In 2007, Shapiro wrote an article in which he described the \\"Palestinian Arab population\\" as \\"rotten to the core\\" and places the blame for the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict \\"with the Palestinian Arabs themselves\\". He further believes Israel and America will \\"continue to pay the price in blood and treasure\\" if they refuse to recognize the \\"simple truth\\" that the \\"Palestinian Arab population breeds terrorism, anti-Semitism and anti-Americanism\\". = LGBT rights = In 2010, Shapiro argued that homosexuality should not have been removed as a mental illness from the DSM because homosexuals have higher rates of depression than heterosexuals and do not reproduce. Shapiro opposed the Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court ruling that deemed bans of same-sex marriage unconstitutional. However, he opposes government involvement in marriage, saying, \\"I think the government stinks at this,\\" and expressing concern that because of the ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, at some point the government may try to force religious institutions to perform same-sex weddings against their will. According to Slate, Shapiro has described homosexuality as a sin. He has said that \\"a man and a woman do a better job of raising a child than two men or two women\\". He has stated he does not feel same-sex marriage should be taught to students in schools, saying, \\"In California, they've already passed laws that you have to teach same-sex marriage in public schools, for example... I went to public school for elementary school and junior high, I don't know why the government is teaching me anything about this stuff. This is for my parents to teach me. This is a values thing\\". He also states, \\"I'm very much anti gay-marriage in the social sense. As a religious person, I think homosexuality is a sin, I think that lots of things are sins that people engage in, I think they should be free to engage in them.\\" In 2014, Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center disputed Shapiro's assertion that the United States \\"is not a country that discriminates against homosexuals\\" and that \\"there is a vastly minute amount of discrimination against gays in this country.\\" Shapiro believes transgender people suffer from mental illness. Shapiro has commented, \\"You can't magically change your gender. You can't magically change your sex,\\" and has compared such changes to the notion of changing one's age. In July 2015, Shapiro and transgender rights activist Zoey Tur were on Dr. Drew On Call to discuss Caitlyn Jenner's receipt of the Arthur Ashe Courage Award. After Shapiro repeatedly referred to Tur, who is a trans woman, with male pronouns, she placed her hands around his neck and threatened on air to send him \\"home in an ambulance\\". Shapiro replied, \\"That seems mildly inappropriate for a political discussion.\\" He later filed a police report against Tur. In 2019, in response to 2020 Democratic Party presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke calling for the removal of the tax-exempt status of religious institutions opposed to same-sex marriage, Shapiro said that if O'Rourke was going to try to \\"indoctrinate\\" his children in religious schools he would be forced to either \\"leave the country\\" or \\"pick up a gun.\\" =Muslims= In a 2014 YouTube video entitled \\"The Myth of the Tiny Radical Muslim Minority\\", Shapiro said, \\"We're above 800 million Muslims who are radicalized ‚Äì more than half the Muslims on earth. That's not a minority... the myth of the tiny radical Muslim minority is just that: it's a myth\\". Fact-checks by PolitiFact and Channel 4 News in the UK rejected his methodology and concluded his claim was false. In a 2002 article, Shapiro wrote, \\"I am getting really sick of people who whine about 'civilian casualties'... when I see in the newspapers that civilians in Afghanistan or the West Bank were killed by American or Israeli troops, I don't really care\\". Shapiro declared that \\"One American soldier is worth far more than an Afghan civilian\\", accusing Afghan civilians of being \\"fundamentalist Muslims\\" who provide cover for terrorists or give them money. Shapiro later apologized for these assertions. He stated that the 2002 article was \\"just a bad piece, plain and simple, and something I wish I'd never written\\". He said that while he still partially agreed with his article's main point‚Äî\\"that we must calculate the risk to American services members when we design rules of engagement\\"‚Äîhe \\"expressed [that point] in the worst possible way, and simplifie[d] the issue beyond the bounds of morality (particularly by doubting the civilian status of some civilians)\\". An RCMP document presented at the sentencing hearing of Quebec mosque shooter Alexandre Bissonnette showed that the murderer checked in on Shapiro's Twitter feed 93 times in the month leading up to the shooting. Shapiro condemned the attack and called Bissonnette an \\"evil piece of human crap\\". In 2019, Shapiro said that American-Muslim congresswoman Ilhan Omar, whose comments about American support for Israel were accused of evoking antisemitic tropes, and the white supremacist San Diego shooter, hold \\"a lot of the same opinions about Jews.\\" He has argued that immigrants from Islamic countries degrade the United States. = Political ideology = Ben Shapiro speaking at Politicon in Pasadena, California in 2016 In 2016, Shapiro described himself as \\"basically a libertarian\\". The New Yorker, Haaretz and Vox have described Shapiro as \\"right-wing\\". Shapiro's views have been described by The New York Times as \\"extremely conservative\\". According to a 2020 study, The Ben Shapiro Show \\"offered a mainstream conservative perspective that favors President Donald Trump.\\" Shapiro accuses the political left of believing in an imaginary \\"hierarchy of victimhood\\" in which the opinions of members of persecuted groups like the LGBT community are afforded more credence. He has argued that the left has dominated American culture through popular entertainment, media, and academia in a way that has made conservatives feel disenfranchised, and helped lead to the election of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Shapiro supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq, arguing that \\"China is a dictatorship. North Korea is a dictatorship. Saudi Arabia, Libya, Syria, Pakistan and Egypt are all dictatorships. We can't overthrow all of those regimes simply to free their citizens. We have to focus on those regimes that endanger American security.\\" In 2006, Shapiro called for sedition laws to be reinstated. He cited speeches critical of the George W. Bush administration by Democrats Al Gore, John Kerry and Howard Dean as \\"disloyal\\" and seditious. Shapiro subsequently retracted these views in a 2018 column, stating that his 2006 column \\"absolutely blows. It's garbage\\" and adding that the idea of sedition laws was \\"inherently idiotic\\". Shapiro later described President Barack Obama's 2010 State of the Union Address as \\"philosophically fascist.\\" Shapiro has called for lowering taxes on the very wealthy. He has also backed privatizing Social Security and repealing the Affordable Care Act. Shapiro has acknowledged that climate change is occurring, but questioned \\"what percentage of global warming is attributable to human activity.\\" Regarding sea-level rise as a result of climate change which will result in coastal property being flooded, Shapiro said, \\"You think people aren't just going to sell their homes and move?\\" = Race = In a 2011 tweet, Shapiro noted that Jewish people are plagued by \\"Bad Jews\\", and that they \\"largely vote Democrat\\". The same year, he wrote an article titled \\"Jews in Name Only\\" in which he claimed \\"Jews who vote for Obama are, by and large, Jews In Name Only (JINOs)\\" and that such Jews \\"do not care about Israel\\" or that they \\"care about it less than abortion, gay marriage and global warming\\". During the 2016 presidential election, he wrote an article titled \\"No, It Doesn‚Äôt Matter That Bernie Sanders Is Ethnically Jewish. He‚Äôs a Jew In Name Only.\\" Shapiro has argued that African-Americans were historically victims of injustice in the United States, but that they are not victims of widespread systemic injustice today. Shapiro has dismissed the idea that the United States was founded on slavery and argued that America \\"was founded in spite of slavery.\\" In 2017, Shapiro argued that \\"The idea that black people in the United States are disproportionately poor because America is racist; that's just not true.\\" Shapiro was one of several conservative commentators condemning Representative Steve King (R-IA) after King's January 2019 comments in defense of the terms \\"white supremacy\\" and \\"white nationalism\\". Shapiro called for King to be censured, and supported King's 2020 primary challenger Randy Feenstra. = Safe spaces = Shapiro is an outspoken opponent of safe spaces. = Western civilization = Shapiro frequently praises \\"western culture\\" and \\"western civilization\\". In 2019, he said, \\"I believe Western civilization is superior to other civilizations.\\" = Music = In response to the Megan Thee Stallion and Cardi B song WAP, Shapiro questioned whether the song's lyrics were empowering for women. He later tweeted that his only real concern with the song was whether the \\"women involved get the medical care they require\\", stating he had been told by his \\"doctor wife\\" that the lyrics described potential symptoms of Bacterial vaginosis, Yeast infection, or Trichomonas vaginalis. Personal life Shapiro's sister is Abigail Shapiro, an opera singer; she has been subjected to online antisemitic trolling due to her brother's high public profile.Pink, Aiden (October 30, 2017) \\"Anti-Semitic Trolls Attack Conservative Commentator Ben Shapiro's Sister\\" The Forward Shapiro's maternal cousin is writer and former child actress Mara Wilson.

As of November 2017, they live in Los Angeles. In 2019, the FBI arrested a man from Washington for making death threats against Shapiro and his family. In September 2020, Shapiro announced that he and his family are in the process of moving out of California. Works * Brainwashed: How Universities Indoctrinate America's Youth ().

It has many names depending on the country and region. These drums are commonly used in the music of Middle East. These drums have both a deep bass sound and a thin treble sound due to their construction and playing style, where different heads and sticks are used to produce different sounds on the same drum. Names Some names of davuls include: *tupan (Goranian: Tupan) *dahol (Kurdish: dahol, Southern Kurdish: D√Æwe≈Ç) *davul (, literally meaning \\"drum\\") *davil (Tamil: davil) *davula (Sinhala) *daul, t«épan, tupan () *goƒç, tapan, tupan () *tapan () *tobƒÉ/dobƒÉ () *tabl ( or tabl baladi) *tof () *daouli (), literally meaning \\"drum\\" *lodra, tupana, daulle () *dohol () *doli () *dhol () *dawola/davola () *moldvai dob (Hungarian: moldvai dob) *Dawula (Sri Lankan ancient Drum) Other Greek names for this drum include Davouli, Argano, Toskani, Tsokani, Toubi, Toubaki, Kiossi, Tavouli, Pavouli, Toubano, and Toubaneli. Additionally, other names for the daouli, depending on the area, include toumpano, tymbano, or toumbi, which stem from the (); this word exists in English in the word tympani for the drum section in the modern classical orchestra and the tympanic membrane for the eardrum. Traditional uses In the southern Balkans, the rhythm of the tapan is complex and utilizes many accents in numerous traditional time signatures. In Macedonia, tapans are most often used to accompany other instruments such as the zurla and gaida, while in Bulgaria they usually accompany gaida and gadulka. They are also played solo in some Albanian, Bulgarian and Macedonian folk dances and songs. For centuries the tapan is irreplaceable at Bulgarian village festivities such as weddings and celebrations of patron saints of homes and villages. In Romania and Moldova the toba is sometimes used to accompany dances. In the regions of Moldavia, Maramures and Bihor there are also some varieties with a small cymbal mounted on top. They are generally struck with a wooden mallet on one skin and with a thinner stick on the rim or cymbal. In Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia, the davul is most commonly played with the zurna, although it can be played with other instruments and in ensembles as well. It has also traditionally been used for communication and for Turkish mehter, or janissary music. In Iraq and the Levant, it is predominantly used in Assyrian folk dance and Assyrian folk/pop music, among Assyrian people, which are mostly accompanied by a zurna, a wind instrument. In Armenia the dhol does not have as large of a circumference and is usually played with the hands, although a wooden, spoon-shaped drumstick is also used. It is frequently heard in Armenian folk music. Not only is it in folk music but also in modern music as well, even having solos in many prominent songs.Dauli - Davul of Turkey. Construction Karag√∂z is shown with his davul. The drum shell is made of hard wood, perhaps walnut or chestnut, though many woods may be in use depending on the region where the drum is made. To make the shell, the wood is boiled in water to make it bendable, and then it is bent into a cylindrical shape and fastened together. The heads are usually goat skin, and they are shaped into circles by wooden frames. However, one head may be goat skin to provide a higher tone, while the other head can be sheepskin, calfskin, or even donkey-skin to provide a lower tone. Some say that wolf skin and even dog skin are preferred. Rope threaded back and forth across the shell of the drum, from head to head in a zigzag pattern, holds the heads on the drum and provides tension for tuning the drum. Sometimes metal rings or leather straps join neighboring strands of the rope in order to allow for further tuning. Two rings are sometimes attached to the main rope where a belt-like rope is threaded through to hold the drum. In the former Yugoslavian republics and Bulgaria, the tapan is made in two dimensions, , at about 50 ‚Äì 55 cm diameter, and or tapanche, at about 30 ‚Äì 35 cm diameter. In Turkey, davuls typically range in size from 60 cm to 90 cm in diameter. Cow hide is used for the bass pitch drum head side, while goat skin is used for the thin, high pitched side. In Greece, daouli can be 12 to 14 inches for the toumbi up to 3 to 4 feet for daouli. Commonly the drum is about 20 to 30 inches. Playing style Players often use a rope hooked to the drum to hold the drum sideways, so that one head is accessible with the left hand and one with the right. Each hand is usually dedicated to playing one side of the drum exclusively, though this can vary by local style and tradition. Drummers of this drum typically uses two kinds of sticks. The drummer plays the accented beats with the dominant hand on the side of the drum with the thicker skin, using a special stick known as the , , or (daouli stick). This stick is a thick pipe-like stick about 440 mm long, which is often made with walnut. Its thick shape as well as the thickness of the head give the accented beats a low, full sound. Sometimes the drumhead played with the thick stick is also muted with a cloth to enhance the fundamental low note of the drum. Unaccented beats are played by the nondominant hand on the side of the drum having the thin skin, using a thin stick or switch called , , or (daouli switch). This thin stick is often held cross-grip, and the drummer can quickly hit thin accent strokes by gently twisting the wrist. These thin sticks are often made from soft wood such as willow or cornel. The Balkan school of tapan playing presumes the playing (not the accompaniment) of a melody, where the non- dominant hand is used to express all that the player wishes to say, while the dominant hand is only used to accentuate certain moments in the melody. The Macedonian Australian drummer Chris Mitrevski pioneered a hybrid style of playing, relying on multiple accented notes played by the non-dominant hand. This style is difficult to play but results in a very complex poly-rhythm, with the dominant hand accenting the down beat.

It was originally used as a traditional fishing boat from around 1870 until the 1930s, although it survived as a commercial fishing vessel until the 1950s. From the 1970s onwards a community of enthusiasts started restoring old couta boats to use recreationally.  History  = As a fishing vessel = The couta boat was developed for the coastal fishing industry over the later part of the 19th century. Fishermen chased fish often incorrectly identified as 'Barracouta'; a confusion with the larger ocean barracuda species. Couta boats caught the species \\"Thyrsites atun\\" but fishing cooperatives established quotas to control prices, and it was this that led to the added requirement of speed in a good fishing boat. The boats headed out to the fishing grounds before dawn, most often through the entrance to Port Phillip, the infamous and often treacherous Rip, where the couta boats‚Äô qualities of seaworthiness were proven. Once their quota of Barracouta was met, the fishermen turned their efforts to sailing back to port as fast as they could ‚Äî the first boat back got the best prices. Although load carrying capacity was important, the need for speed under sail was also a desired characteristic. The typical couta boat carried a gaff sail and jib set out on a long bowsprit, although the main sail developed into more of a gunter sail, as it had a very high peaked gaff or yard. A rig peculiar to the couta boat evolved, which allowed for sail to be carried much higher than previously, and included the distinctive curved down bowsprit. As efficient and competitive commercial fishing vessels, couta boats reached their peak around the 1920s and 1930s. After World War II, the development of engines and the public‚Äôs growing preference for shark started to push the couta boat from centre stage. = As a recreational sailing boat = The couta boat became a victim of the modernisation of the fishing industry after World War II, and survives due only to the efforts of a small group of individuals with a keen sense of history and admiration for working maritime traditions. Regretting the apparent inevitability that these distinctive boats would be relegated to the status of a footnote to Australia‚Äôs seafaring history and perhaps vanish into obscurity, from the late 1970s onwards, a few dedicated unsung heroes sought and restored the remaining original couta boats that were either still afloat or propped up in backyards along the coast. Whilst never receiving formal recognition, their heroic deeds are forever cemented in the Australian psyche. This working fishing craft‚Äôs compromise between seaworthiness, speed and capacity has made it a quintessential recreational sailing boat nowadays. Couta boats are highly sought after and keenly compete in races. Many are built new from scratch, as the supply of originals has been exhausted. There is a couta boat club in Sorrento and another in Queenscliff. Early Examples Thistle, one of the oldest surviving examples of a couta boat was designed and built around 1903 by JR Jones in Victoria. She was purchased in 1987 and restored by Tim Phillips for the Australian National Maritime Museum and went on display in 1990.

Life Born in Winnipeg, Barbara Weidman met Nathaniel Branden because of their mutual interest in Ayn Rand's works. They became personal friends of Rand in 1950, and when they married in 1953, Rand and her husband, Frank O'Connor, served as the matron of honor and best man. She earned her M.A. in philosophy, and authored a thesis on free will, under the direction of Sidney Hook at New York University. Nathaniel and Barbara Branden became founding members of an Objectivist movement that sought to advance Rand's ideas. In 1954, Nathaniel Branden began a secret romantic affair with Rand with the reluctant permission of both spouses. This relationship continued for three years. While their respective spouses, Barbara Branden and Frank O'Connor, had knowledge of the affair and nominally accepted it, Branden later said it led to \\"years of pain\\" and \\"enormous harm\\", describing it as a \\"sacrifice\\". Barbara and Nathaniel Branden co-wrote Who Is Ayn Rand? in 1962. Barbara Branden's essay in the book was the first biography of Rand. When it was written, Rand considered Barbara Branden to be one of the most important proponents of Objectivism. She served as the Executive Director of the Nathaniel Branden Institute, and gave a series of lectures on \\"Principles of Efficient Thinking.\\" In 1968, when Rand terminated her association with Nathaniel Branden after she discovered that he had become involved with actress Patrecia Scott more than four years earlier, she likewise disassociated herself from Barbara Branden for keeping this fact from her. The details of these events remain controversial. In 1986, Barbara Branden published another biography of Rand, The Passion of Ayn Rand. The book, written after Rand's death in 1982, caused a rift among Rand's followers because it not only stated that Rand and Nathaniel Branden had been lovers, but that Rand had broken with them when she learned of his affair with Scott. Rand had previously claimed that the friendship broke up over other matters, but letters in her estate confirmed Barbara Branden's version of the cause. The book was made into an Emmy Award-winning motion picture in 1999 starring Helen Mirren as Rand, Eric Stoltz as Branden and Julie Delpy playing Barbara.The Passion of Ayn Rand (1999). IMDb. Retrieved March 2, 2007. She contributed the lead essay \\"Ayn Rand: The Reluctant Feminist\\" to the anthology Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand, wherein she argued that the way Rand lived her life made it a feminist manifesto, even as Rand had disagreements with feminism. Barbara Branden was estranged from her cousin Leonard Peikoff, Rand's chosen intellectual and legal heir after Rand's break with Nathaniel Branden.

Edwin was the son of James Wilson Cheney (b. August 20, 1841) and Armilla Armanda (b. ca. 1846), daughter of Linus S. and Rebekah J. (Jaegger) Perkins. His father was born in Royalton, MA, and moved to Maine with his parents ca. 1850. James W. entered Oberlin College in 1860 before enlisting in the 7th Ohio Infantry in April 1861. After his marriage to Armilla Perkins on May 27, 1868, he moved from Shelbyville, IL, to Detroit, MI, in 1870 where he engaged in manufacturing tool-handles and other specialty items. Edwin's sister, Luella Emory Cheney, was born April 11, 1871 (adopted).Charles Henry Pope, The Cheney Genealogy (Boston, MA: Charles H. Pope, 1897), 195, https://archive.org/details/cheneygenealogy00pope Cheney became an electrical engineer. He commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to build his family a house in Oak Park. Wright engaged in a love affair with Edwin's wife Mamah, with whom he went to Europe in 1909. Upon their return, Mamah moved into Taliesin, the new house Wright was building for them, while it was still under construction. Mamah and Edwin were divorced in 1911, and a year later Edwin married Elizabeth Meller, a schoolteacher friend of Mamah's sister Lizzie. In 1914, Julian Carlton, a domestic servant at Taliesin, killed Mamah and her two children, John and Martha, who happened to be visiting (Edwin still had primary custody). Four others were also murdered during this event, and Carlton, following ingestion of acid in an apparent suicide attempt, died before being tried. Edwin Cheney and his second wife had 3 more children. They later moved to Webster Groves, Missouri, where he continued to work for Wagner Electric until his death. The Edwin H. Cheney House in Oak Park is now used as a bed & breakfast with two guest rooms. An opera, Shining Brow, covers the story of the Cheneys and Wrights, from when they meet in Wright's office, through the aftermath of Mamah's death. Music by Daron Hagen and lyrics by Paul Muldoon.

Categories =Indigenous music= Oklahoma is the traditional homeland of the Caddo, Wichita, and Tonkawa peoples. The US federal government's Indian Removal policy of the 19th century moved many other tribes into the area, and now the state is headquarters to 40 federally recognized tribes. Oklahoma is diverse crossroads of Native American musicians. This rich collection of traditional music is performed in powwows all over the state. Additionally, the music is enriched by Indian musicians' exposure to other tribe's songs through the many intertribal meetings in the state. The American Indian Exposition in Anadarko is a longstanding gathering of Southern Plains Tribes featuring many musicians. Among Eastern tribes, stomp dances feature male singers with accompaniment by women's turtle shell leg rattles. 49 songs, a 20th-century genre based on traditional war dance songs, originated in Oklahoma among the Kiowa tribe in southwestern Oklahoma and quickly spread to other tribes through the American Indian Exposition at Anadarko. The name comes from a burlesque show that toured the area in the 1920s called the \\"Girls of '49\\" for its California Gold Rush theme. A 49 (or forty-nine) is a gathering following a pow-wow and the songs are usually love songs, mostly in English, with repeated refrains of vocables.Velie, American Indian Literature, page 89 Kiowa \\"49\\" Songs. =Barbershop= The Barbershop Harmony Society's Southwestern District includes Oklahoma, with several barbershop chapters across the state. In 1999, the Music Central chorus from Oklahoma City competed internationally, ranking among the top twenty. Sweet Adelines International has several women's choruses across Oklahoma within its Heart of America region. Both of these international singing organizations were founded in Tulsa, Oklahoma. =Country= The traditional Appalachian folk ballads brought by new settlers from the South infused Oklahoma with a music about the lives of everyday people. Much of the music was overtly religious as the rural communities revolved around their churches. Another distinctive type of country music grew out of the dance halls and roadhouses, especially in the oil boom areas of eastern Oklahoma. This honky-tonk style music from Oklahoma and the surrounding states became a staple of American country music for years. =Gospel= Oklahoma has had a long tradition of Gospel music. \\"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\\" and \\"Steal Away To Jesus\\", standard Gospel tunes, were written by Wallis Willis, a former slave in the old Choctaw Nation of southeastern Oklahoma. Alexander Reid, a minister at a Choctaw boarding school after the Civil War, transcribed the words and melodies and sent the music to the Jubilee Singers of Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. The Jubilee Singers then popularized the songs during a tour of the United States and Europe.Savage, Singing Cowboys, page 5. Albert E. Brumley, a Spiro, Oklahoma native, wrote a number of Gospel classics that have become a standard in Gospel singer's repertoires. His best-known compositions include \\"I'll Fly Away,\\" \\"Jesus Hold My Hand,\\" and \\"Turn Your Radio On.\\" These songs are commonplace in many church hymnals today. =Jazz and swing= The territory bands of the 1920s and 30s brought a new style of music to Oklahoma. Many of the well-known swing musicians tuned their skills and styles touring with these regional bands. These bands brought the big-band orchestras to many communities never visited by the more popular groups from New York. Perhaps the most famous of the Oklahoma-based territory bands were the Oklahoma City Blue Devils. The Blue Devils were the foundation for Count Basie's orchestra. The Al Good Orchestra, also from Oklahoma City, began playing in the Oklahoma area in the 1940s and continue to play after Al Good's death in 2003. Bandleader Ada Leonard was born in Lawton. In addition, a number of prominent jazz musicians came from Oklahoma; these include Charlie Christian, Oscar Pettiford, Don Byas, Cecil McBee, Barney Kessel, Sam Rivers, Don Cherry, Chet Baker, Jimmy Rushing, Sunny Murray, and Jay McShann. Although most of these self-identified as African American, many (including Pettiford) were also partly of Native American ancestry. =R&B;= R&B; singer, drummer, and bandleader Roy Milton was born in Wynnewood. Guitarist and bandleader Jimmy Liggins was born in Newby. Pianist and vocalist Joe Liggins was born in Guthrie. =Rock and roll= One of the hot spots for rock and roll in Oklahoma during the 60's was Ronnie Kaye's \\"The Scene\\" in Oklahoma City. It featured local garage rock and psychedelic bands. Musicians such as songwriter J. J. Cale, Elvin Bishop, and Leon Russell have ties to Tulsa, Oklahoma (see The Tulsa Sound), and Tulsa's Cain's Ballroom has become a notable small-venue club for touring bands. After the success of cult icons The Flaming Lips, under-the-radar act Starlight Mints, and 90's alternative groups Chainsaw Kittens and The Nixons, Norman has become a hotspot for local and nationwide indie music. Pop-rock band Hanson, who had a string of hits in the mid-90s, hails from Tulsa; as do Admiral Twin, and Caroline's Spine. Alternative-rock band The All-American Rejects was formed in Stillwater; and post-grunge band Hinder, notable for their hit \\"Lips of an Angel\\" hails from Oklahoma City. The 1990s had a Hardcore Punk Rock scene in Edmond, Oklahoma which included bands such as The Lunch Bunch, Blaster, The Real Ones, Bi-Products, Aspects, Suburban Bitches, Dry Heave, The Takers, The Boxcar Children, and many more who played shows at the Edmond Legion Hall, the Edmond Armory, The Outback, Hafer Park and The Sheep Farm. =Western or cowboy= Prior to Oklahoma's opening for settlement, cowboys pushing cattle from Texas to the railheads developed a style and subject of music that became known as Cowboy or Western. As they settled on the ranches they continued their traditional style of singing. The romanticism of the cowboy in the popular culture brought a wider audience to the music. Although the writers of these traditional Western songs are mostly unknown, Dr. Brewster Highley, author of perhaps the most famous of the cowboy ballads, \\"Home on the Range\\", followed the frontier into Oklahoma where he died in 1911. Otto Gray and his Oklahoma Cowboys were the first nationally popular cowboy band. Formed in 1924 by William McGinty, Oklahoma pioneer and former Rough Rider, the band performed on radio and national vaudeville circuits from 1924 through 1936. Otto Gray, the first singing cowboy, and all of the band members were recruited from Oklahoma ranches.Savage, Singing Cowboys, page 34. =Western Swing= Oklahoma was a center for the development and spread of Western swing. Performers playing the traditional western music, influenced heavily by the territory bands, added fiddles and steel guitars to their orchestras to produce a new and very popular type of music. Bob Wills, and His Texas Playboys, based in Tulsa, influenced this music for more than a generation. One of the more distinctive early Western swing bands from Oklahoma was Big Chief Henry's Indian String Band, a family group of Choctaw Indians, who performed out of Wichita, Kansas, during the 1920s, and who were recorded by H. C. Speir of Victor Records in 1929. Bob Dunn was a pioneer steel guitarist born in Beggs.

Other stations followed and soon, anyone with a radio could hear music previously unavailable to them. Still, many radios broadcast local music. KVOO in Tulsa aired Western swing from Bob Wills for more than twenty years. In 1958, KOMA, a 50,000 watt radio station in Oklahoma City, began a format of playing Top 40 recordings and Rock & Roll. Its signal strength allowed many young people across the Great Plains and Western states to listen to music not available from their local stations and influenced many of their local music markets. Oklahoma currently supports many radio stations. Most play music that ranges from classical to hip-hop. Much of their content, however, is taped and the same programs broadcast over several stations throughout the U.S. Very little local music is aired.

Oklahoma Music Archives  Founded in 2019, the Oklahoma Music Archives is a not-for-profit cultural website whose mission is to preserve the past, present, and future of Oklahoma's music culture. The archive is a database of current and past artists who are from Oklahoma or have strong ties to the state as well as albums released by those artists and biographies for individual musicians. Its database spans all genres and all decades, including any known artists predating statehood. As a wiki, the website is dynamic and ever expanding with more articles of interest relating to the Oklahoma music scene, due in part to user input. It is the largest public database of musical artists and albums specific to Oklahoma and also has plans to expand to include venues and studios, historical and current, as well as provide resources to assist artists.

The site features news, articles, live coverage of cricket matches (including liveblogs and scorecards), and StatsGuru, a database of historical matches and players from the 18th century to the present. , Sambit Bal was the editor.Sambit Bal at ESPNcricinfo. Accessed 2 June 2016 The site, originally conceived in a pre-World Wide Web form in 1993 by Simon King, was acquired in 2002 by the Wisden Grouppublishers of several notable cricket magazines and the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. As part of an eventual breakup of the Wisden Group, it was sold to ESPN, jointly owned by The Walt Disney Company and Hearst Corporation, in 2007. History CricInfo was launched on 15 March 1993 by Simon King, a British researcher at the University of Minnesota and Badri Seshadri with help from students and researchers at universities around the world. The site was reliant on contributions from fans around the world who spent hours compiling electronic scorecards and contributing them to CricInfo's comprehensive archive, as well as keying in live scores from games around the world using CricInfo's scoring software, \\"dougie\\". In 2000, Cricinfo's estimated worth was $150 million; however it faced difficulties the following year as a result of the dotcom crash. Cricinfo's significant growth in the 1990s made it an attractive site for investors during the peak of the dotcom boom, and in 2000 it received $37 million worth of Satyam Infoway Ltd. shares in exchange for a 25% stake in the company (a valuation of around ¬£100 million). It used around $22m worth of the paper to pay off initial investors but only raised about ¬£6 million by selling the remaining stock. While the site continued to attract more and more users and operated on a very low cost base, its income was not enough to support a peak staff of 130 in nine countries, forcing redundancies. Cricinfo in 1995 By late 2002 the company was making a monthly operating profit and was one of very few independent sports sites to avoid collapse (such as Sports.com and Sportal). However, the business was still servicing a large loan. Cricinfo was eventually acquired by Paul Getty's Wisden Group, the publisher of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack and The Wisden Cricketer, and renamed Wisden Cricinfo. The Wisden brand (and its own wisden.com site) were eventually phased out in favor of Cricinfo for Wisden's online operations. In December 2005, Wisden re- launched its recently discontinued Wisden Asia Cricket magazine as Cricinfo Magazine, a magazine dedicated to coverage of Indian cricket. The magazine published its last issue in July 2007. In 2006, revenue was reported to be ¬£3m.Cricket: Cricinfo website makes plans for the future  Sport  The Guardian In 2007, the Wisden Group began to be broken up and sold to other companies; BSkyB acquired The Wisden Cricketer, while Sony Corporation acquired the Hawk-Eye ball tracking system. In June 2007, ESPN Inc. announced that it had acquired Cricinfo from the Wisden Group. The acquisition was intended to help further expand Cricinfo by combining the site with ESPN's other web properties, including ESPN.com and ESPN Soccernet. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. As of 2018, Sambit Bal is the Editor-in-Chief of ESPNcricinfo. In 2013, ESPNcricinfo.com celebrated its twentieth anniversary with a series of online features. The annual ESPNcricinfo Awards have also become an extremely popular event in the cricket calendar. Popularity ESPNcricinfo's popularity was further demonstrated on 24 February 2010, when the site could not handle the heavy traffic experienced after Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar broke the record for the highest individual male score in a One Day International match with 200*. Features ESPNcricinfo contains various news, columns, blogs, videos and fantasy sports games. Among its most popular feature are its liveblogs of cricket matches, which includes a bevy of scorecard options, allowing readers to track such aspects of the game as wagon wheels and partnership breakdowns. For each match, the live scores are accompanied by a bulletin, which details the turning points of the match and some of the off-field events. The site also used to offer Cricinfo 3D, a feature which utilizes a match's scoring data to generate a 3D animated simulation of a live match. Regular columns on ESPNcricinfo include \\"All Today's Yesterdays\\", an \\"On this day\\" column focusing on historical cricket events, and \\"Quote Unquote\\", which features notable quotes from cricketers and cricket administrators. \\"Ask Steven\\" is a weekly column, published on Tuesdays, in which Steven Lynch answers users' questions on all things cricket. Among its most extensive features is StatsGuru, a database originally created by Travis Basevi, containing statistics on players, officials, teams, information about cricket boards, details of future tournaments, individual teams, and records. In May 2014, ESPNcricinfo launched CricIQ, an online test to challenge every fan's cricket knowledge.

They were first derived by Alexander Friedmann in 1922 from Einstein's field equations of gravitation for the Friedmann‚ÄìLema√Ætre‚ÄìRobertson‚ÄìWalker metric and a perfect fluid with a given mass density \\\\rho and pressure p. (English translation: ). The original Russian manuscript of this paper is preserved in the Ehrenfest archive. The equations for negative spatial curvature were given by Friedmann in 1924. (English translation: )  Assumptions  The Friedmann equations start with the simplifying assumption that the universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic, i.e. the cosmological principle; empirically, this is justified on scales larger than ~100 Mpc. The cosmological principle implies that the metric of the universe must be of the form : ds^2 = a(t)^2 \\\\, ds_3^2 - c^2 \\\\, dt^2 where ds_3^2 is a three-dimensional metric that must be one of (a) flat space, (b) a sphere of constant positive curvature or (c) a hyperbolic space with constant negative curvature. This metric is called Friedmann‚ÄìLema√Ætre‚ÄìRobertson‚ÄìWalker (FLRW) metric. The parameter k discussed below takes the value 0, 1, ‚àí1, or the Gaussian curvature, in these three cases respectively. It is this fact that allows us to sensibly speak of a \\"scale factor\\" a(t). Einstein's equations now relate the evolution of this scale factor to the pressure and energy of the matter in the universe. From FLRW metric we compute Christoffel symbols, then the Ricci tensor. With the stress‚Äìenergy tensor for a perfect fluid, we substitute them into Einstein's field equations and the resulting equations are described below.  Equations  There are two independent Friedmann equations for modeling a homogeneous, isotropic universe. The first is: : \\\\frac{\\\\dot{a}^2 + kc^2}{a^2} = \\\\frac{8 \\\\pi G \\\\rho + \\\\Lambda c^2}{3} which is derived from the 00 component of Einstein's field equations. The second is: :\\\\frac{\\\\ddot{a}}{a} = -\\\\frac{4 \\\\pi G}{3}\\\\left(\\\\rho+\\\\frac{3p}{c^2}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{\\\\Lambda c^2}{3} which is derived from the first together with the trace of Einstein's field equations. a is the scale factor, G, Œõ, and c are universal constants (G is Newton's gravitational constant, Œõ is the cosmological constant, and c is the speed of light in vacuum). œÅ and p are the density and pressure, respectively. k is constant throughout a particular solution, but may vary from one solution to another. In previous equations, a, œÅ, and p are functions of time. k \\\\over a^2 is the spatial curvature in any time-slice of the universe; it is equal to one-sixth of the spatial Ricci curvature scalar R since R = \\\\frac{6}{c^2 a^2}(\\\\ddot{a} a + \\\\dot{a}^2 + kc^2) in the Friedmann model. H \\\\equiv \\\\frac{\\\\dot{a}}{a} is the Hubble parameter. We see that in the Friedmann equations, a(t) does not depend on which coordinate system we chose for spatial slices. There are two commonly used choices for a and k which describe the same physics: *k = +1, 0 or ‚àí1 depending on whether the shape of the universe is a closed 3-sphere, flat (i.e. Euclidean space) or an open 3-hyperboloid, respectively.Ray A d'Inverno, Introducing Einstein's Relativity, . If k = +1, then a is the radius of curvature of the universe. If k = 0, then a may be fixed to any arbitrary positive number at one particular time. If k = ‚àí1, then (loosely speaking) one can say that i¬∑a is the radius of curvature of the universe. *a is the scale factor which is taken to be 1 at the present time. k is the spatial curvature when a = 1 (i.e. today). If the shape of the universe is hyperspherical and R_t is the radius of curvature (R_0 in the present-day), then a = R_t/R_0. If k is positive, then the universe is hyperspherical. If k is zero, then the universe is flat. If k is negative, then the universe is hyperbolic. Using the first equation, the second equation can be re-expressed as :\\\\dot{\\\\rho} = -3 H \\\\left(\\\\rho + \\\\frac{p}{c^2}\\\\right), which eliminates \\\\Lambda and expresses the conservation of mass-energy T^{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}{}_{;\\\\beta} \\\\, = 0. These equations are sometimes simplified by replacing :\\\\rho \\\\rightarrow \\\\rho - \\\\frac{\\\\Lambda c^2}{8 \\\\pi G} :p \\\\rightarrow p + \\\\frac{\\\\Lambda c^4}{8 \\\\pi G} to give: :H^2 = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\dot{a}}{a}\\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{8 \\\\pi G}{3}\\\\rho - \\\\frac{kc^2}{a^2} :\\\\dot{H} + H^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\ddot{a}}{a} = - \\\\frac{4\\\\pi G}{3}\\\\left(\\\\rho + \\\\frac{3p}{c^2}\\\\right). The simplified form of the second equation is invariant under this transformation. The Hubble parameter can change over time if other parts of the equation are time dependent (in particular the mass density, the vacuum energy, or the spatial curvature). Evaluating the Hubble parameter at the present time yields Hubble's constant which is the proportionality constant of Hubble's law. Applied to a fluid with a given equation of state, the Friedmann equations yield the time evolution and geometry of the universe as a function of the fluid density. Some cosmologists call the second of these two equations the Friedmann acceleration equation and reserve the term Friedmann equation for only the first equation.  Density parameter  The density parameter \\\\Omega is defined as the ratio of the actual (or observed) density \\\\rho to the critical density \\\\rho_c of the Friedmann universe. The relation between the actual density and the critical density determines the overall geometry of the universe; when they are equal, the geometry of the universe is flat (Euclidean). In earlier models, which did not include a cosmological constant term, critical density was initially defined as the watershed point between an expanding and a contracting Universe. To date, the critical density is estimated to be approximately five atoms (of monatomic hydrogen) per cubic metre, whereas the average density of ordinary matter in the Universe is believed to be 0.2‚Äì0.25 atoms per cubic metre.Rees, M., Just Six Numbers, (2000) Orion Books, London, p. 81, p. 82 Estimated relative distribution for components of the energy density of the universe. Dark energy dominates the total energy (74%) while dark matter (22%) constitutes most of the mass. Of the remaining baryonic matter (4%), only one tenth is compact. In February 2015, the European-led research team behind the Planck cosmology probe released new data refining these values to 4.9% ordinary matter, 25.9% dark matter and 69.1% dark energy. A much greater density comes from the unidentified dark matter; both ordinary and dark matter contribute in favour of contraction of the universe. However, the largest part comes from so-called dark energy, which accounts for the cosmological constant term. Although the total density is equal to the critical density (exactly, up to measurement error), the dark energy does not lead to contraction of the universe but rather may accelerate its expansion. Therefore, the universe will likely expand forever. An expression for the critical density is found by assuming Œõ to be zero (as it is for all basic Friedmann universes) and setting the normalised spatial curvature, k, equal to zero. When the substitutions are applied to the first of the Friedmann equations we find: :\\\\rho_c = \\\\frac{3 H^2}{8 \\\\pi G}, :(with Ho = 67.4 km/s/Mpc = 2.2 √ó 10‚àí18 s‚àí1, œÅc = 8.5 √ó 10‚àí27 kg/m3) The density parameter (useful for comparing different cosmological models) is then defined as: :\\\\Omega \\\\equiv \\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\rho_c} = \\\\frac{8 \\\\pi G\\\\rho}{3 H^2}. This term originally was used as a means to determine the spatial geometry of the universe, where \\\\rho_c is the critical density for which the spatial geometry is flat (or Euclidean). Assuming a zero vacuum energy density, if \\\\Omega is larger than unity, the space sections of the universe are closed; the universe will eventually stop expanding, then collapse. If \\\\Omega is less than unity, they are open; and the universe expands forever. However, one can also subsume the spatial curvature and vacuum energy terms into a more general expression for \\\\Omega in which case this density parameter equals exactly unity. Then it is a matter of measuring the different components, usually designated by subscripts. According to the ŒõCDM model, there are important components of \\\\Omega due to baryons, cold dark matter and dark energy. The spatial geometry of the universe has been measured by the WMAP spacecraft to be nearly flat. This means that the universe can be well approximated by a model where the spatial curvature parameter k is zero; however, this does not necessarily imply that the universe is infinite: it might merely be that the universe is much larger than the part we see. (Similarly, the fact that Earth is approximately flat at the scale of the Netherlands does not imply that the Earth is flat: it only implies that it is much larger than the Netherlands.) The first Friedmann equation is often seen in terms of the present values of the density parameters, that is :\\\\frac{H^2}{H_0^2} = \\\\Omega_{0,R} a^{-4} + \\\\Omega_{0,M} a^{-3} + \\\\Omega_{0,k} a^{-2} + \\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda}. Here \\\\Omega_{0,R} is the radiation density today (i.e. when a=1), \\\\Omega_{0,M} is the matter (dark plus baryonic) density today, \\\\Omega_{0,k} = 1 - \\\\Omega_0 is the \\"spatial curvature density\\" today, and \\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda} is the cosmological constant or vacuum density today.  Useful solutions  The Friedmann equations can be solved exactly in presence of a perfect fluid with equation of state :p=w\\\\rho c^2, where p is the pressure, \\\\rho is the mass density of the fluid in the comoving frame and w is some constant. In spatially flat case (k = 0), the solution for the scale factor is : a(t)=a_0\\\\,t^{\\\\frac{2}{3(w+1)}} where a_0 is some integration constant to be fixed by the choice of initial conditions. This family of solutions labelled by w is extremely important for cosmology. E.g. w=0 describes a matter-dominated universe, where the pressure is negligible with respect to the mass density. From the generic solution one easily sees that in a matter-dominated universe the scale factor goes as :a(t)\\\\propto t^{2/3} matter-dominated Another important example is the case of a radiation- dominated universe, i.e., when w=1/3. This leads to :a(t)\\\\propto t^{1/2} radiation dominated Note that this solution is not valid for domination of the cosmological constant, which corresponds to an w=-1. In this case the energy density is constant and the scale factor grows exponentially. Solutions for other values of k can be found at . =Mixtures= If the matter is a mixture of two or more non-interacting fluids each with such an equation of state, then :\\\\dot{\\\\rho}_{f} = -3 H \\\\left( \\\\rho_{f} + \\\\frac{p_{f}}{c^2} \\\\right) \\\\, holds separately for each such fluid f. In each case, :\\\\dot{\\\\rho}_{f} = -3 H \\\\left( \\\\rho_{f} + w_{f} \\\\rho_{f} \\\\right) \\\\, from which we get :{\\\\rho}_{f} \\\\propto a^{-3 (1 + w_{f})} \\\\,. For example, one can form a linear combination of such terms :\\\\rho = A a^{-3} + B a^{-4} + C a^{0} \\\\, where: A is the density of \\"dust\\" (ordinary matter, w = 0) when a = 1; B is the density of radiation (w = 1/3) when a = 1; and C is the density of \\"dark energy\\" (w=‚àí1). One then substitutes this into :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\dot{a}}{a}\\\\right)^2 = \\\\frac{8 \\\\pi G}{3} \\\\rho - \\\\frac{kc^2}{a^2} \\\\, and solves for a as a function of time. =Detailed derivation= To make the solutions more explicit, we can derive the full relationships from the first Friedman equation: :\\\\frac{H^2}{H_0^2} = \\\\Omega_{0,R} a^{-4} + \\\\Omega_{0,M} a^{-3} + \\\\Omega_{0,k} a^{-2} + \\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda} with :H = \\\\frac{\\\\dot{a}}{a} :{H^2} = H_0^2 ( \\\\Omega_{0,R} a^{-4} + \\\\Omega_{0,M} a^{-3} + \\\\Omega_{0,k} a^{-2} + \\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda}) :H = H_0 \\\\sqrt{( \\\\Omega_{0,R} a^{-4} + \\\\Omega_{0,M} a^{-3} + \\\\Omega_{0,k} a^{-2} + \\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda}} :\\\\frac{\\\\dot{a}}{a} = H_0 \\\\sqrt{( \\\\Omega_{0,R} a^{-4} + \\\\Omega_{0,M} a^{-3} + \\\\Omega_{0,k} a^{-2} + \\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda})} :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}a }{\\\\mathrm{d} t} = H_0 \\\\sqrt{(\\\\Omega_{0,R} a^{-2} + \\\\Omega_{0,M} a^{-1} + \\\\Omega_{0,k} + \\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda} a^2)} :\\\\mathrm{d}a = \\\\mathrm{d} t H_0 \\\\sqrt{(\\\\Omega_{0,R} a^{-2} + \\\\Omega_{0,M} a^{-1} + \\\\Omega_{0,k} + \\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda} a^2)} Rearranging and changing to use variables a' and t' for the integration :t H_0 = \\\\int_{0}^{a} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}a'}{\\\\sqrt{(\\\\Omega_{0,R} a'^{-2} + \\\\Omega_{0,M} a'^{-1} + \\\\Omega_{0,k} + \\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda} a'^2)}} Solutions for the dependence of the scale factor with respect to time for universes dominated by each component can be found. In each we also have assumed that \\\\Omega_{0,k} \\\\approx 0, which is the same as assuming that the dominating source of energy density is \\\\approx 1. For Matter dominated universes, where \\\\Omega_{0,M} >> \\\\Omega_{0,R} and \\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda}, as well as \\\\Omega_{0,M} \\\\approx 1. :t H_0 = \\\\int_{0}^{a} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}a'}{\\\\sqrt{(\\\\Omega_{0,M} a'^{-1})}} :t H_0 \\\\sqrt{\\\\Omega_{0,M}} = ( \\\\frac{2}{3} a'^{\\\\frac{3}{2}} ) ^a_0 : ( \\\\frac{3}{2} t H_0 \\\\sqrt{\\\\Omega_{0,M}})^{\\\\frac{2}{3}} = a(t) which recovers the aforementioned a \\\\propto t^{\\\\frac{2}{3}} For Radiation dominated universes, where \\\\Omega_{0,R} >> \\\\Omega_{0,M} and \\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda}, as well as \\\\Omega_{0,R} \\\\approx 1 :t H_0 = \\\\int_{0}^{a} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}a'}{\\\\sqrt{(\\\\Omega_{0,R} a'^{-2})}} :t H_0 \\\\sqrt{\\\\Omega_{0,R}} = \\\\frac{a'^2}{2} ^a_0 : (2 t H_0 \\\\sqrt{\\\\Omega_{0,R}})^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} = a(t) For \\\\Lambda dominated universes, where \\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda} >> \\\\Omega_{0,R} and \\\\Omega_{0,M}, as well as \\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda} \\\\approx 1, and where we now will change our bounds of integration from t_i to t and likewise a_i to a. :(t-t_i) H_0 = \\\\int_{a_i}^{a} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}a'}{\\\\sqrt{(\\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda} a'^2)}} : (t - t_i) H_0 \\\\sqrt{\\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda}} = \\\\mathrm{ln}(a') ^a_{a_i} :a_i \\\\mathrm{e}^{(t - t_i) H_0 \\\\sqrt{\\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda}}} = a(t) The \\\\Lambda dominated universe solution is of particular interest because the second derivative with respect to time is positive, non-zero; in other words implying an accelerating expansion of the universe, making \\\\rho_{Lambda} a candidate for dark energy: :a(t) = a_i \\\\mathrm{e}^{(t - t_i) H_0 \\\\sqrt{\\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda}}} :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^2 a(t) }{\\\\mathrm{d} t^2} = a_i (H_0)^2 \\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda} \\\\mathrm{e}^{(t - t_i) H_0 \\\\sqrt{\\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda}}} Where by construction a_i > 0, our assumptions were \\\\Omega_{0,\\\\Lambda} \\\\approx 1, and H_0 has been measured to be positive, forcing the acceleration to be greater than zero.  Rescaled Friedmann equation  Set \\\\tilde{a}=\\\\frac{a}{a_0}, \\\\;\\\\rho_c=\\\\frac{3H_0^2}{8\\\\pi G},\\\\; \\\\Omega=\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{\\\\rho_c},\\\\; t=\\\\frac{\\\\tilde{t}}{H_0},\\\\; \\\\Omega_c=-\\\\frac{kc^2}{H_0^2 a_0^2}\\\\;, where a_0 and H_0 are separately the scale factor and the Hubble parameter today.

She was a founding member of Welsh rock band Catatonia and a leading figure in the \\"Cool Cymru\\" movement of the late 1990s. Matthews programmes and hosts a weekly music show on BBC Radio 6 Music, a weekly blues show on BBC Radio 2, and a monthly show on the BBC World Service, makes documentaries for television and radio and is a roving reporter for The One Show. She founded 'The Good Life Experience', a festival of culture and the great outdoors in Flintshire in 2014, with Charlie and Caroline Gladstone and is author of Hook, Line and Singer published by Penguin and children's stories Tales From The Deep and Gelert, A Man's Best Friend, Gomer. Early life Matthews was born in Cardiff, the second of four children. The family moved to Swansea when she was seven. She went to Bryn Y Mor Welsh language school until 11 years of age, then attended St Michael's School, Llanelli. She then attended Ysgol Bro Gwaun comprehensive school when she lived in the Pembrokeshire village of Trefin and Bryanston school, for ten months, a school in Dorset, England. She is fluent in English, Welsh, Spanish, and French. She has cited her childhood heroes as being Pippi Longstocking and writers William Butler Yeats and Dylan Thomas. She learned to play the guitar at the age of nine, sang Welsh folk songs and taught herself traditional songs from all over the globe including blues and Irish folk songs. She was a member of the West Glamorgan Youth Orchestra. She had a stint in Spain as a nanny, where she learned to speak Catalan. Career =Catatonia= Catatonia were formed in 1992, after Matthews met Mark Roberts. She subsequently sang lead vocals on, and co-wrote the music and lyrics for, the band's hits. Songs she co-wrote included \\"You've Got a Lot to Answer For\\", \\"Mulder and Scully\\", \\"Dead from the Waist Down\\", and \\"Road Rage\\". Matthews also played guitar on the earlier material before second guitarist Owen Powell joined the band. She also performed a single with the band Space named \\"The Ballad of Tom Jones\\", which tells the story of two lovers who want to kill each other, but then hear a Tom Jones song that defuses their homicidal feelings. Matthews later collaborated with Jones to record a version of Frank Loesser's \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" on Jones' 1999 album Reload. Matthews was voted the \\"Sexiest Female in Rock\\" in a 1999 readers' poll in the now defunct magazine Melody Maker. After Catatonia's rise to fame with their second album International Velvet, and subsequent success with Equally Cursed and Blessed, the band returned in 2001 with their fourth studio album Paper Scissors Stone. In September 2001 the band officially split. =2000s= Matthews joined The Pet Shop Boys on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury in June 2000, performing a duet of their hit \\"What Have I Done To Deserve This\\". In December 2001, she returned to the recording studio for the first time since Catatonia split up. She recorded a song in both English and Welsh for the pre-school cartoon series Sali Mali.Cartoon Sali Mali joins Channel 4, BBC News, 28 July 2009 Retrieved 23 November 2009 She provided guest vocals on the track \\"Cyclops Rock\\", from US alternative rock band They Might Be Giants 2001 album Mink Car.

Matthews moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 2001. On her arrival she began playing with Bucky Baxter, who had played lap steel guitar for Bob Dylan and Ryan Adams. She had already collected seventy-six traditional folk songs with the idea of making an album of folk covers. Her debut album, Cockahoop, ended up consisting mainly of her own songs. It was recorded in seven months and appeared on Blanco y Negro Records in the United Kingdom in May 2003. Whilst recording this album she met Seth Riddle, whom she married in Pembrokeshire on 22 February 2003.Cerys arrives for wedding on tractor, BBC Wales ‚Äì 22 February 2003 She toured the album around Britain with minimal promotion as she was several months pregnant at the time. The album's Stateside Records release followed in October 2004. In December 2005, Matthews recorded a new version of Len Barry's 1960s UK and US top 10 hit \\"1-2-3\\" in Nashville. She released it as a download-single with all profits going to a children's charity. In early 2006, Matthews introduced material from her then upcoming album at SXSW in Austin, Texas. In 2006, Matthews conducted a short tour of the UK to promote her new second solo album, Never Said Goodbye. The new album was preceded by the single \\"Open Roads\\". Band members included Kevin Teel on guitar, Ben Elkins playing keyboards, Mason Neely on drums, and Jeff Irwin playing bass. She headlined Cardiff's Big Weekend festival. During September and October 2006, Matthews embarked on a UK and Ireland tour, during which she played tracks from her first two solo albums as well as three Catatonia hits. She also embarked upon a short acoustic Welsh tour in November 2006 before returning to Nashville for Christmas. Matthews appeared on the 2007 series of ITV's I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, which aired from 12 to 30 November. She was voted off one day before the final episode, coming fourth behind Jason \\"J\\" Brown, Janice Dickinson and eventual winner Christopher Biggins. Matthews became involved with fellow contestant Marc Bannerman after the show, but they split four months later. Matthews appeared at the live Guilty Pleasures concert at the Hackney Empire, London in 2007. She performed the Bonnie Tyler hit \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\" and the Dolly Parton/Kenny Rogers duet \\"Islands in the Stream\\" along with Terry Hall and the BBC Concert Orchestra In an interview on the eve of the launch of her Welsh mini-album Awyren = Aeroplane, Matthews confirmed she had divorced from Riddle and temporarily moved back to her farm in Pembrokeshire.Divorced Cerys returns to Wales, BBC Wales ‚Äì 15 October 2007 Awyren = Aeroplane won her the 'Contemporary Composition' award in the National Eisteddfod.

Matthews played the Isle of Wight and Hay festivals in 2012, the latter with a Woody Guthrie tribute show, and collaborated with artists such as Arun Ghosh, Tunde Jegede, Attab Haddad, Frank Moon and the London Bulgarian Choir. 2012 also saw her play music from her acclaimed and popular selling collection of Welsh traditional songs 'Tir', with Ballet Cymru, ending in a show in Sadler's Wells, and a nomination for a Theatre Critics Award 2012. She produced and arranged Christmas album Baby, it's Cold Outside (2012) to much acclaim, recognised by the Sunday Times as an \\"essential seasonal album\\" . Cerys played UK literary festivals including Dartington, Chester, Hay and Edinburgh and released an album of traditional Welsh reels and songs Hullabaloo'. Matthews sang Patsy Cline's Crazy and Dylan's Blowin' in the wind as part of the memorial service for esteemed War correspondent Marie Colvin, in May 2012. Matthews appeared as a celebrity guest mentor on the first series of the UK version of The Voice for Tom Jones's Team broadcast. Matthews won gold at the 2013 Sony Radio Academy Awards, winning in the 'Music Broadcaster of the year' category. Baby it's Cold Outside, released for Christmas 2013 on the Rainbow City label, is a selection of Christmas carols and classic Christmas songs all arranged and produced by Matthews using instruments such as Chinese temple blocks, oud, celeste and coconut shells. She was Artistic Director for the opening ceremony of Womex 2013 representing Wales. In 2014, Matthews co- founded an interactive festival, The Good Life Experience, with Charlie and Caroline Gladstone, held every September on the Gladstone estate in Hawarden, Flintshire near the Cheshire border. It is a festival which celebrates the great outdoors, with abseiling, campfires, axe throwing, foraging, talk on survival, as well as cultural activities, crafts, books and music. Matthews won a prestigious 'St David Award' - for her contribution to culture in 2014 - run by the Welsh government, in its inaugural year, 2014. Other prize winners on the night were Bryn Terfel and Lyn Evans. She was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to music. In July 2014 Matthews was awarded an honorary degree from Swansea University. Matthews won the Best Presenter Music award at the Audio Production Awards on 23 November 2016. In 2017 she was a guest presenter on the BBC's coverage of the Royal Welsh Show, along with Andi Oliver and Omar Hamdi. On 14 May 2018, Matthews took over from Paul Jones as the presenter of the Blues Show on Radio 2. In 2019 Matthews was one of the three judges for the 2020 Countryfile Calendar, sold in aid of Children in Need. =Personal life= Matthews married Steve Abbott in 2012 and they live with their family in West London. =Books= Hook, Line and Singer, Matthews' collection of singalong classics published by Penguin, became a top 3 Sunday Times bestseller in 2013. The book includes personal anecdotes and song histories. Song examples are \\"Let's Go Fly A Kite\\", \\"Oh Susannah\\", and \\"Swing Low Sweet Chariot\\". Tales From the Deep is Matthews' duo of stories written in verse with paintings by Fran Evans, published by Gomer. It was nominated for a People's Choice Award. It was followed by Gelert, a man's best friend (Gomer, 2013) Where The Wild Cooks Go is Matthews book of recipes, music, poems and cocktails, published by Penguin Random House.

C3 convertase (C4bC2b, formerly C4b2a) belongs to family of serine proteases and is necessary in innate immunity as a part of the complement system which eventuate in opsonisation of particles, release of inflammatory peptides, C5 convertase formation and cell lysis. C3 convertase can be used to refer to the form produced in the alternative pathway (C3bBb) or the classical and lectin pathways (C4bC2b, formerly C4b2a). Once formed, both C3 convertases will catalyze the proteolytic cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b (hence the name \\"C3-convertase\\"). The smaller fragment called C3a serves to increase vascular permeability and promote extravasation of phagocytes, while the larger C3b fragment can be used as an opsonin or bind to either type of C3 convertase to form the trimolecular C5 convertase to activate C5 for the membrane attack complex.  Formation  C3 convertase formation can occur in three different pathways: the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways. = Alternative pathway = Cleavage of complement C3 by a free floating convertase, thrombin, plasmin or even a bacterial enzyme leads to formation of C3a and C3b fragments. C3b, the larger fragment, becomes covalently attached to the microbial surface or to the antibody molecules through the thioester domain at the site of complement activation. After cleavage and binding to cell surface, the C3b fragment is ready to bind a plasma protein called Factor B. The Factor B (a zymogen) is cleaved by a plasma serine protease Factor D releasing a small fragment called Ba and generating a larger fragment called Bb that remains attached to C3b. Also Mg2+ ions are necessary for forming a functional C3 convertase. Thus, the alternative C3 convertase (C3bBb) is formed and is able to cleave C3 via its dimeric Bb subunit. Since C3 convertases cleave C3 to produce C3b which can then form an additional C3 convertase through the alternative pathway, this is a potential mechanism of signal amplification in the complement cascade resulting in the deposition of large numbers of C3b molecules on the surface of activating particles, enabling opsonisation and acute local inflammation. = Classical and lectin pathways = The C3 convertase formed in the classical or lectin pathways is formed of C4b and C2b instead (NB: C2b, the larger fragment of C2 cleavage, was formerly known as C2a). The cleavage of C4 and C2 is mediated by serine proteases. In the classical pathway, this is by sequential proteolytic activation of proteins within the C1 complex (C1q, C1r, C1s) in response to binding to CRP or immunoglobulin, and in the lectin pathway it is driven by mannose binding lectin and its associated serine proteases (MASPs, particularly MASP2 but also MASP1). C4 is homologous to C3 in that it contains an internal thioester bond that ends up on C4b. Thus it can form covalent amide or ester linkages with the plasma membrane of the pathogen and any associated antibodies, where it then behaves as an opsonin. The larger C2b produced by C2 hydrolysis attaches to the C4b to form the classical C3 convertase, C4b2b (formerly called C4b2a). The smaller fragments of proteolysis, C4a and C2a are released. C4a is an anaphylatoxin. Regulation * C3 convertases are unstable (half-life 10 ‚Äì 20 min) ‚Äì respectively they are deactivated upon spontaneous dissociation or by facilitated dissociation mediated by the regulators of complement activation proteins decay accelerating factor (DAF), complement receptor 1 (CR1), C4b-binding protein and Factor H. Convertase assembly is suppressed by the proteolytic cleavage of C3b (and C4b) as mediated by Factor I in the presence of membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46), C4b-binding protein, CR1, or a plasma-glycoprotein Factor H. These negative control processes are essential for the protection of self-tissue. * Properdin (Factor P) is the only known positive regulator of complement activation that stabilizes the alternative C3 convertase (C3bBb). Properdin deficient individuals are sensitive to pyogenic infections. Properdin also promotes association of C3b with Factor B and thus it inhibits the Factor H mediated cleavage of C3b by Factor I. Nevertheless, this positive feedback mechanism can be regulated by binding of the control protein, nonproteolytic glycoprotein Œ≤1H (factor H), to C3b, which prevents association of factor B, and facilitates the decay-dissociation of Bb in the C3bBb complex, in addition to enhancing proteolytic inactivation of C3b by C3b inactivator (C3bINA ‚Äì endopeptidase). Membrane-associated sialic acid promotes high-affinity binding of Œ≤1H to C3b without influencing the affinity of B for C3b. Decay-accelerating factor (DAF) is another negative regulator of C3 convertase. It is a membrane protein and regulates also C5 convertase of the classical and alternative pathway. DAF protects host cells from damage by autologous complement. DAF acts on C2b and Bb and dissociates them rapidly from C4b and C3b ‚Äì thereby preventing the assembly of the C3 convertase. C4 binding protein (C4BP) interferes with the assembly of the membrane-bound C3 convertase of the classical pathway. C4BP is a cofactor for the enzyme C3bINA. C4b-binding protein inhibits the haemolytic function of cell-bound C4b. C4b-binding protein and C3b inactivator control the C3 convertase of the classical pathway in a similar way to that described for Œ≤1H and C3b inactivator in the alternative pathway. C3b has different binding site for C3bINA, Œ≤1H, factor B and properdin. Binding Œ≤1H to C3b increases C3bINA binding, while factor B binding prevents C3bINA binding and is competitive with Œ≤1H binding. Regulation of the amplification phase of the alternative pathway is exerted by multiple mechanisms: *Intrinsic decay of C3 convertase *Stabilization of C3 convertase by properdin *Disassembly of this enzyme by serum glycoprotein Œ≤1H *Inactivation of C3b *Protection of C3 convertase from the activation of these control proteins afforded by the surface properties of certain cells and other activators of the alternative pathway.  Location on chromosome  The genes encoding C2, C4 and factor B are located on chromosome 6 between the B locus of class I products and the D locus of class II products in the MHC.

It maintains a constant flow below the confluence of several tributaries, notably the Maryburn, Forks, and Grays rivers. The lower reaches (below the Maryburn confluence) are popular with anglers chasing brown and rainbow trout, although recent infestation by the invasive algae didymo (Didymosphenia geminata) has somewhat limited angling opportunities. Most of Lake Tekapo's outflow is now carried by the Tekapo-Pukaki canal (pictured), instead of the Tekapo River. Originally, the river flowed southwest for from the southern end of Lake Tekapo before joining with the Pukaki River and flowing into the northern end of Lake Benmore. However, the water from Lake Tekapo is now diverted via a canal to Lake Pukaki as part of the Waitaki hydroelectric scheme. These lakes are used to store water, and occasionally during a particularly heavy snow melt or if the power stations or canal need servicing, water may spilt from either the dam or canal back into the riverbed. These events are much anticipated by kayakers, to the extent that they have been known to re-shape parts of the riverbed to create \\"better\\" rapids. In 2020, there were warnings of potential water spill. Normally, its summer maximum level is set at 709.8 meters above the sea level whereas it reached 709.9m at one point.

New Zealand cuisine is largely driven by local ingredients and seasonal variations. An island nation with a primarily agricultural economy, New Zealand yields produce from land and sea. Similar to the cuisine of Australia, the cuisine of New Zealand is a diverse British-based cuisine, with Mediterranean and Pacific Rim influences as the country becomes more cosmopolitan. Historical influences came from British cuisine and MƒÅori culture. Since the 1970s new cuisines such as New American cuisine, Southeast Asian, East Asian, and South Asian have become popular. The MƒÅori term kai is widely used in New Zealand to refer to food, especially traditional MƒÅori cuisine. MƒÅori cuisine A hƒÅngi dinner as served to tourists. When the indigenous MƒÅori arrived in New Zealand from tropical Polynesia they brought a number of food plants, including k≈´mara (sweet potato), taro, , and . Most of these plants grew well only in the north of the North Island; k≈´mara could be grown as far south as the northern South Island, and became a staple food that could be stored over winter. Native New Zealand plants such as fernroot became a more important part of the diet, along with insects such as the huhu grub. Earthworms, called noke, are even unusually a part of the traditional MƒÅori diet. Problems with horticulture were made up for by an abundance of bird and marine life. The large flightless moa were soon hunted to extinction. RƒÅhui (resource restrictions) included forbidding the hunting of certain species in particular places or at certain times of year, so that the numbers could regenerate. Preparation of a modern hƒÅngi for tourists at Mitai Maori Village, Rotorua. Like other Polynesian people, MƒÅori cooked food in earth ovens, known in New Zealand as hƒÅngi, although the word umu is also used as in other Pacific languages. Stones are heated by fire and food packed in leaves are placed on top. The packs are further covered with foliage and cloth, or, wet sacks, then earth. Other cooking methods included roasting and, in geothermal areas, boiling or steaming using natural hot springs and pools. Occasionally food would be boiled in non-geothermal areas by putting hot stones into a bowl with water and the food; and some food was also cooked over the open fire. Some foods were preserved using smoke, air-drying, fermentation or layers of fat‚Äîparticularly muttonbirds. MƒÅori were one of the few people to have no form of alcoholic beverage. =Food and religion= In traditional MƒÅori religion food was noa, or non-sacred. This meant care had to be taken to prevent it from coming into contact with tapu places or objects. If it did, the tapu of the place or object, and often the people associated with it, would be at risk. High chiefs, and people engaged in tapu work such as tattooing, were tapu and were restricted in how they could deal with food; the most tapu needing to be fed by others. One story tells of a war party which had to be postponed as no non-tapu people were available to load the food supplies into the party's waka. =European influences= Sheep grazing in Canterbury. Early British settlers introduced Western stock and crops, New Zealand agriculture now produces an abundance of fresh produce. When Europeans (PƒÅkehƒÅ) first arrived in New Zealand from the late eighteenth century, they brought their own foods with them. Some of these, especially pork and potatoes, were quickly adopted by MƒÅori. Potatoes were particularly popular as they were grown in a similar way to k≈´mara but produced a much higher yield with less effort. Other European foods such as wheat, pumpkin, mutton, sugar, and many types of fruit also became a part of the MƒÅori diet and were widely traded with visiting ships.https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/-/media/ReserveBank/Files/Publications/Factsheets%20and%20Guides/factsheet- the-reserve-bank-and-nzs-economic-history.pdf American sailors brought new varieties of kumara to New Zealand, and these high-yield varieties quickly superseded the original varieties of kumara. (Today most k≈´mara are the commercial varieties Owairaka Red, Toka Toka Gold and Beauregard.) Alcohol, initially rejected as 'wai piro' (stinking water), also became part of MƒÅori life.'Wai Piro' in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New Zealand Most MƒÅori tribes grew surpluses of food for trade with other tribes and with European visitors and settlers. Some tribes grew wealthy from this trade, although the MƒÅori food industry declined in the mid-nineteenth century because of land loss and competition from settler farmers. Many traditional food sources, such as the kereru (wood pigeon) and other birds, as well as some types of fish and plants, became scarce as forests were destroyed and species were over-hunted. =MƒÅori cuisine today= A MƒÅori boil-up Present day MƒÅori cuisine is a mixture of MƒÅori tradition, old-fashioned English cookery, and contemporary dishes. Most large MƒÅori gatherings feature a hƒÅngi, which is likely to contain foods brought to New Zealand by MƒÅori and by PƒÅkehƒÅ. In recent decades there has been much concern that MƒÅori have picked up the worst of European eating habits and as a result are disproportionately likely to suffer from obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Two dishes regarded as distinctively MƒÅori are the boil up - of pork, potatoes, k≈´mara, and dumplings - and pork and puha (sow thistle) which combine introduced and indigenous foods. Both dishes owe much to nineteenth century British cooking methods. Also distinctive is rƒìwena or \\"Maori bread\\", which is made with fermented potatoes. New Zealand European cuisine The majority of New Zealanders are PƒÅkehƒÅ of British descent, so it is not surprising that the cuisine owes much to British cuisine. =British Isles settler food= Nineteenth-century British settlers in New Zealand tried as much as possible to reproduce the foods of their homeland. In the early stages of colonisation this was difficult as many ingredients were unavailable. PƒÅkehƒÅ settlers ate native birds and fish, and used local ingredients in substitution for those which were unavailable, for example brewing tea and beer using unconventional plants. Most of these innovations were abandoned as the PƒÅkehƒÅ population increased and conventional ingredients began to be mass-imported or produced in New Zealand. One innovation which was commonly served on New Zealand tables until the mid-1980s was colonial goose, a stuffed leg of lamb which substituted for goose. A major difference between British and PƒÅkehƒÅ food was that meat was much more readily available to all social classes in New Zealand. Whereas in nineteenth century Britain, labourers ate meat in very small quantities, in New Zealand they could have it for every meal. Since meat was a high status food in Britain, British settlers in New Zealand ate vast quantities of it. Like the British, PƒÅkehƒÅ have traditionally preferred sweet foods, and a wealth of baking dishes celebrate important occasions, reflected through cakes, scones, muffins and other mainly sweet baking dishes. The country's most iconic recipe book, the Edmonds Cookery Book, originally began as publicity material for a baking powder company, and contains a high proportion of baking recipes. =From Antipodean British fare to Asia-Pacific fusion= For most of the twentieth century, New Zealand cuisine remained highly derivative of British food. Unlike Britain, New Zealand escaped major food shortages during World War II. However, demands of the US forces in the Pacific as well as exports to Britain saw meat and butter rationed between 1943 and 1950. From about the 1960s, the advent of affordable air travel allowed New Zealanders to travel overseas more easily. Many New Zealanders went to Europe on overseas experience where they encountered French and Italian cooking, and also the Indian and Chinese restaurants of Britain as well as the New British cuisine. When they returned home they helped create a demand for better quality food and more variety. They also tried to discover what New Zealand cuisine was, experimenting with hangi and gaining a greater appreciation of New Zealand produce. The United Kingdom's joining of the European Economic Community (EEC) (now the European Union) in 1973 sounded the death knell of New Zealand's identity as an agricultural producer for the British Isles, and the formal cultural ties, including cuisine, with the United Kingdom started to become diluted. During this period, certain non- British or Irish European dishes, such as beef bourguignon, had shed the 'ethnic' connotation and entered the mainstream New Zealand cooking. The 1970s also saw major changes in take-away food with the arrival of the first American fast-food chains: Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) in 1971, Pizza Hut in 1974, and McDonald's in 1976. The 1980s was marked with economic liberalisation dubbed Rogernomics (named for the then Minister of Finance, Roger Douglas) that abolished farm subsidies, forcing many farmers to find alternative means of survival. Many chose to produce specialty cheese types like Havarti, Brie and Stilton, or diversified into growing olives or grapes instead of traditional meat and dairy farming. Avocado oil for cooking was commercialised in New Zealand in 1999 by a group of growers based in the Tauranga region. Rogernomics also abolished much of import tariffs and instituted a more relaxed agricultural product import quarantine regime. This allows hereunto prohibited or prohibitively expensive specialty foods, such as genuine serrano ham from Spain, extra virgin olive oil from Italy, and mango from Thailand, to be available in New Zealand at reasonable costs. These two developments from Rogernomics have given birth to a proliferation of specialist food products available in New Zealand. On top of changes in available ingredients, the 1980s also witnessed a wholescale liberalisation in attitude towards the formerly 'foreign muck' cooking styles and segmentation of lifestyles according to income and socio-economic status. New Zealand had by this time developed a largely distinct cultural outlook away from the British Isles, and this also made foreign cooking styles more acceptable among the general public. The same era also saw the moneyed populations feeling free to openly emulate the luxurious eating and drinking habits of upper and upper middle classes overseas, as the traditional New Zealand preference of egalitarianism, manifested in widespread prejudice against any deviation from lower middle class lifestyles, waned in influence. In the words of New Zealand-based anthropologist David Veart, this period of seachange in New Zealand's culinary culture was akin to \\"being let out after a long school detention\\". Other cuisines in New Zealand People from many different backgrounds have settled in New Zealand, and many have tried to reproduce their native cuisines or national dishes in New Zealand. Similar to early PƒÅkehƒÅ settlers, this often proved difficult. Larger ethnic groups, such as the Chinese, were able to import some ingredients, but often dishes had to be modified to use local ingredients. Ethnic restaurants have served as community meeting places and have also given other New Zealanders a chance to try different cuisines. However, for most of its history there were few ethnic restaurants in New Zealand other than inauthentic Chinese, Indian and Italian eateries. The Immigration Act 1986 completely abolished nationality preference for immigration, and immigration from East Asia, Southeast Asia and South Asia has skyrocketed since. Many of these immigrants have brought their different cuisines to New Zealand, and often opened ethnic restaurants and takeaway eateries, giving New Zealanders a chance to try more authentic editions of Japanese, Thai, Malay, regional Chinese, Indian, and other Asian cuisines. Over time these ethnic cuisines have been gradually accepted by PƒÅkehƒÅ and MƒÅori New Zealanders. Consequently, most New Zealand cities have a wide variety of ethnic restaurants, and foods such as kebabs, couscous, and sushi are served virtually everywhere. Many ethnic origin dishes have been willingly adopted by New Zealanders as their own, including sushi, antipasto, butter chicken, pad thai, pasta, such that they appear in home cooking, as well as in generic New Zealand restaurants. Ingredients for many ethnic dishes have become much easier to find in major cities, mostly through speciality or ethnic food stores started by many of the post-1987 migrants to New Zealand, but in some cases also through mainstream New Zealand supermarket chains. Similar to Australia, in time the increasing availability of ingredients gave birth to a more authentic style of ethnic cooking, and some ethnic food ingredients have been adopted for local cooking: ingredients such as extra virgin olive oil and sun-dried tomatoes, and to a lesser extent fish sauce and rice paper were already seen as ordinary ingredients by the year 2000, whereas even by the late 1980s many people would still have regarded them as highly exotic. Contemporary scene This hamburger at a Botany fast food chain contains slices of canned beetroot. As a result of various developments, the food scene of New Zealand in the early 21st century is in a state of flux: cosmopolitan Pacific Rim fare's reign is now the norm in much of metropolitan eating out scenes, and traditional hearty settlers food, now dubbed Kwisine Kiwiana, but reinterpreted through Pacific Rim cooking knowledge, is a popular cooking style for eating out scenes even in the most remote rural regions. Most of the home cooking prepared at households in Auckland is now a mix of traditional Kiwiana dishes heavily modified by Mediterranean and Asian techniques and ingredients, and adapted versions of Mediterranean, Chinese, and Indian dishes. In the more culturally traditional parts of the country, such as rural Canterbury and the West Coast, however, traditional Kiwiana fare is still the norm at many homes. Certain vestiges of traditional Kiwiana dishes remain popular throughout the country, such as fish and chips, meat pies, custard squares, pavlova, and others. An active nostalgia movement supports the traditional Kiwiana cuisine, as spearheaded by the popularity of television series Kiwi Kitchen presented by Richard Till, which is believed to be a public response to a common perception that the traditional Kiwiana dishes are disappearing from the New Zealand tables. Home baking is particularly believed to be the last bastion of New Zealand cuisine still unaffected by international trends. Concurrently, food habits are changing in Australia to lighter fares influenced by the Mediterranean, and subsequently Southeast Asian, styles of cooking. The proximity, common history, and strong modern political, economic, cultural, and family ties between the two countries means many New Zealand diners and chefs have always been well informed of the trends in the Australian dining scene. Many chefs had worked in Australia and endeavour to learn from their trans-Tasman counterparts, and in time the changing Australian culinary scene has trickle-down effects on the New Zealand cuisine as well. In general, there are minimal differences between the food preference of New Zealand and Australia. The food trends in New Zealand tend to trail its trans-Tasman counterparts by a few years to a decade, such as the Mediterranean cookery did not become mainstream in New Zealand until the dawn of the 1990s, while its influence was already felt in Australia by the 1980s; and while Australia has by the early 21st century developed a well established niche specialist produce distributing channel, a similar system is still in its infancy across the Tasman. However, in recent times Auckland and Wellington have food fashions moving essentially in sync with that of Sydney and Melbourne. One major recent development in the food scene is the emergence of a genuine cafe culture and disappearance of the traditional institution of tearooms at large. Before the 1990s, tearooms proliferated throughout the country offering cream tea, with scones, cream, and cucumber sandwiches, muffins, and custard squares, with filtered coffee or tea as drinks. New Zealanders have copied the Australian habit of adopting the Mediterranean practice of drinking espresso derived coffees. In time, cafes became wildly popular and many tearoom owners converted their businesses to cafes. Cream tea has gone out of fashion in the contemporary New Zealand dining scene, and scones are baked at homes rather than served in eateries. Vegetarianism had been regarded as an alternative lifestyle for many years; but became more mainstream during the 1980s even though consistent vegetarians are still rare. Despite exhortations by the Ministry of Health and their allies for people to eat less meat, and more cereals, fruits, and vegetables, a highly meat-based diet remains a part of New Zealand culture, albeit with decrease of red meat consumption and intake of fish and chicken has been on the rise due to their relative affordability compared to red meat. Gluten free foodstuffs have become part of the dietary trends in New Zealand, with cafes and restaurants increasingly offering gluten free versions of popular foods such as cakes, pizza, and hamburger buns. Some supermarkets, delicatessens and bakeries similarly offer gluten free products and there has been a rise in specialty stores. A number of organic raw food operations have developed in the last decade in the major cities. New Zealand cuisine in other countries New Zealand cuisine has made minor impacts on the world at large, although Australia does feel influences from New Zealand cuisine, with certain renowned chefs such as Iain Hewitson, Justin North, Ben Shewry and Philip Johnson being New Zealand-born and Stephanie Alexander and Neil Perry actively including New Zealand culinary styles into their works. Certain personalities, such as foodie Lauraine Jacobs, baker Dean Brettschneider, and writers David Burton and Julie Biuso, are widely respected among the professional food industry around the world. The famed chef Peter Gordon of London hails from New Zealand originally. The country's most famous culinary export, the pavlova, has been the object of a decades-long battle with Australia over where it was invented. Fusion cuisine and foreign cuisine styles interact with modern New Zealand cuisine, with chefs from New Zealand actively learning overseas trends, and chefs like Peter Gordon, bakers such as Dean Brettschneider, and foodies such as Lauraine Jacobs influencing fusion cuisines derived from New Zealand cuisine. Cuisine magazine, first published in 1986, has earned global fame and is held in high prestige among the worldwide foodie communities. Alcoholic beverages New Zealand has a successful wine industry, with about 76 million litres being exported in the year to June 2007. The first vines are thought to have been introduced by missionary Samuel Marsden, and planted in 1817 by Charles Gordon, superintendent of agriculture for the missionaries, according to Dr Richard Smart who was viticultural editor of both editions of The Oxford Companion to Wine. Official British resident James Busby is credited with producing wine at Kerikeri in 1833, and Charles Darwin noted the winery in his diary when he visited Kerikeri in 1835. Small vineyards were also planted by French settlers in Akaroa in the 1840s. However wine was drunk in relatively small qualities well into the twentieth century, with the average per capita consumption only about 2.6 litres in 1966. The high price of imported wines probably prevented New Zealanders from developing a taste for wine, although it did help sales of local vintages. The quality of these wines slowly improved, with New Zealand wines winning three gold and 13 silver medals at the International Wine Fair in 1963. Aided by the deregulation of the economy in the 1980s and 1990s, domestic wine consumption increased and New Zealand wine won increasing accolades internationally. There are 10 major wine-producing areas in New Zealand, with Marlborough famed for its sauvignon blanc, Gisborne for its chardonnay, and Central Otago and Martinborough building a reputation for pinot noir and pinot gris. Hawkes Bay is known for its bold cabernets and Auckland's Waiheke Island is home to one of the top 20 cabernet blends in the world. Marlborough and Hawkes Bay are New Zealand's two premium wine-growing regions. Beer is the most popular alcoholic drink in New Zealand, accounting for 63% of available alcohol for sale. New Zealand is ranked 27th in beer consumption per capita, at around 64.7 litres per person per annum. The vast majority of beer produced in New Zealand is a type of lager, either pale or amber in colour, and between 4% ‚Äì 5% alcohol by volume. There are also over 100 smaller craft breweries and brewpubs producing a vast range of beer styles.Impressions of New Zealand Tom Cannavan, March 2006, www.beer- pages.com. Retrieved 31 August 2008.New Zealand breweries directory RateBeer. Retrieved 20 May 2015. The two largest breweries in New Zealand, Lion Nathan and DB Breweries, control almost 90% of sales by volume between them.Brewer's Association letter to Justice & Electoral Committee, 20 May 2009 New Zealand is also a leading hops producing nation with some of the most sought after hops in the world. Patterns of eating Fish and chips, a popular take-away food in New Zealand. Most New Zealanders eat their main meal ‚Äì known as dinner, or sometimes tea ‚Äì in the evening. Most families living in one household try to eat dinner together several times a week. The formality and structure of these meals vary from family to family. Although few New Zealanders cook most things 'from scratch', most New Zealand home cooks are dependent to some extent on pre-made ingredients (in particular, packaged soup and sauce mixes). Cakes are very rarely made from packet mix - this has never really taken on in New Zealand. Most families eat takeaways (take-out), such as fast food, fish and chips, Chinese food, or pizza about once or twice a week. In flats (households shared by a group of unrelated young people), flatmates will generally either take turns cooking or each cook and eat individually. In the summer, the barbecue is common, generally as a social event. Guests will usually be invited to bring beer (or wine), and on occasion meat, which the host will cook. Sometimes guests contribute a salad to the gathering instead. It is traditional for the men to cook the meat, and for the women to do everything else, although these patterns are changing. Similar MƒÅori gatherings will often feature a hƒÅngi, a pit in which meats or fish are cooked with vegetables. A deep hole is dug in the ground, lined with red-hot stones and covered with vegetation. The food is then placed on top. The whole oven is sprinkled with water and sealed with more vegetation. The hole is then filled with earth and left to steam for several hours. Traditionally, men dig and prepare the hole, and women prepare the food to go in it. All members of an extended family (whanau) help out for such a feast. The occasion is relaxed, friendly and fun, with people often eating the meal under a marquee. Many New Zealand gatherings feature a custom known as 'bring a plate' or 'potluck' in which each guest will bring a plate of food to share. This allows people to host large groups without incurring serious expense. Similar customs include guests bringing salads or meat to a barbecue. Most New Zealand parties are 'BYO' (bring your own alcohol), but in this case the drinks are not usually shared. This is especially the case with parties hosted by young people, who cannot usually afford alcohol for more than a few people. One exception is sometimes the 21st birthday party, which will often be funded by the host's family. Weddings are also normally catered for by the hosts and their family. New Zealand's eating out culture has developed strongly after the mid-1970s, thanks partially to the liberalisation of liquor licensing laws and popularisation of cafes and other similar casual dining establishments. It is common for people to visit cafes regularly for lunch or morning or afternoon snacks. On the other hand, visits to restaurants are still regarded as special occasion treats for most of the population. There is a 'fast food' culture similar to that in the United States, Australia and Britain. Many American fast food chains have a presence in New Zealand, and local variants (such as Burger Fuel and Hell Pizza) have arisen. The pie is possibly the nearest thing New Zealand has to street food, though its popularity has waned. Pies are still the most common take away lunch and are sold everywhere, in dairies, bakeries, supermarkets, petrol stations, school lunch tuck-shops. Pies can be made with beef, lamb, chicken, pork, apple, berries, rhubarb or custard. Traditionally pies are a savory food as opposed to sweet pies. A fast food chain based on pies, Georgie Pie, was founded in 1977; however, it ran into financial trouble and went out of business in 1998, with McDonald's New Zealand buying its assets. The chain was revived in a limited form in 2013, with pies being sold through McDonald's restaurants. Currently another fast food chain selling pies exists: Australian-based Jester's produces pies throughout New Zealand's North Island, predominantly Auckland. In the main centres, food courts have become popular, with several in Auckland alone. Immigration has led to an increase in choice and quality, with many food halls offering Asian cuisines including Thai, Indian, Turkish, Malaysian, Japanese and Chinese, as well as distinctly New Zealand fare such as roast dinners.

A sequel to the game, Postal 2, was released in 2003. Director Uwe Boll bought the movie rights for the series and produced a film of the same name. A March 2001 re-release of the game, called Postal Plus, included a \\"Special Delivery\\" add-on. A remaster of the game, Postal Redux, was released for Microsoft Windows on May 20, 2016. At the end of 2016, the game's source code was released. At the end of 2019, Running With Scissors released the game as freeware.  Gameplay  Postal is a 3D shooter with mainly isometric, but also some top-down levels featuring hand-painted backgrounds. Gameplay and interface are similar to first-person shooters of the time in most, but not on all counts: *Movement is always relative to the orientation of the player character (\\"The Postal Dude\\"). The player, therefore, must always be aware of the direction the character is facing, which can be difficult to some players on the isometric maps. *There are eight weapon slots, each with a fixed amount of maximum ammo. The default weapon is a weak machine gun with unlimited ammo. Although it serves no practical purpose, the player can conceal their weapons by pressing the tilde key. *Contrary to first-person shooters, however, the goal is not to stay alive and just reach the next level, but to kill a given percentage of the armed NPCs on the map. Only then the exit to the next level is activated. Even if the player is dead, they may still exit the level as long as the required number of hostiles have been killed.  Plot  The game follows a man who has been evicted from his home. He believes that the United States Air Force is releasing poison gas in his town and only he is unaffected. He fights his way to the Air Force Base through various areas. During the progress of the game, a voice in the protagonist's head (voiced by Rick Hunter) can be heard taunting his victims. After massacring the Air Force Base, he is then shown trying to massacre an elementary school, however, his weapons have no effect. He then has a mental breakdown and wakes up to find himself in a mental asylum. A doctor gives a report on the protagonist's mental state, suggesting that the stress of urban life may have caused him to \\"go postal\\", over images of a hellish corridor, the protagonist curled up in the fetal position in his cell, a close-up of his face (albeit covered by bindings) and the door to his cell, Cell 593. The final remarks are: \\"We may never know exactly what set him off, but rest assured we will have plenty of time to study him\\". After the credits, manic cackling can be heard, suggesting that the protagonist may have somehow escaped the asylum.  History  = Development = Postal was developed by Running with Scissors and published by Ripcord Games in 1997 for Windows and MacOS. =Releases = In 2000 a Japanese version of Postal called Super Postal was released featuring Japanese voices and two exclusive levels, \\"Tokyo\\" and \\"Osaka\\". These levels have not been released anywhere else, but circulate in the Postal community. Postal: Special Delivery, an expansion to the original Postal, was released on August 28, 1998 and featured four new levels and various new characters and voices. One level, in particular, was set in a parody of Wal-Mart and began with the Dude's demon chastising the store for not selling Postal, which foreshadows the off-kilter humor seen in Postal 2. A March 2001 re-release of the game, called Postal Plus, included the \\"Special Delivery\\" add-on. It was ported to Linux by Loki Entertainment in the same year. In 2002, Postal Plus (known as Postal: Classic and Uncut in Europe) bundled Postal and the Special Delivery expansion, with retail copies also including a demo for Postal 2. =Sequels = A sequel to the game, Postal 2, was released in 2003. Director Uwe Boll bought the movie rights for the series and produced a film of the same name. = Digital distribution re- release = Postal Plus was released on the digital distributor GOG.com in 2009 and a few years later on Steam. In 2013, it was updated with support for widescreen resolutions and modern hardware. The multiplayer component and level editor were removed, however. In 2015, it was updated with full Xbox 360 controller support. = Open source = In 2015, the developers announced that they will release the source code of the game \\"if someone promises to port it to the Dreamcast\\". \\"We're going to release the POSTAL 1 source code soon, but only if someone promises to port it to the Dreamcast.\\" on twitter.com/RWSbleeter (2015) In June 2016 the developers gave the source code to a community developer who ported the game to Linux for the OpenPandora handheld.POSTAL 1 running on Open Pandora.

A PlayStation 4 port was announced, however, due to financial constraints, it was canceled, as announced in an official Running with Scissors podcast. Plans have been made to port the game on Linux. A Nintendo Switch version was released on October 16, 2020.  Reception  NPD Techworld, a firm that tracked sales the United States, reported 49,036 units sold of Postal by December 2002. Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Overall, Postal is a title that breaks absolutely no new ground, but its tongue-in-cheek shooting action comes together to form a well-above-average shooter that adds to the genre.\\" Postal received mixed reviews from critics. GameRankings and Metacritic scores are respectively 57.00% and 56/100. GameSpot's Mark East gave the game a 6.6/10 score and commented: \\"The lack of longevity in the single-player mode and the simplistic multiplayer options make Postal a moderately fun ride, at best.\\" In a retrospective, GamingOnLinux reviewer Hamish Paul Wilson gave the game 7/10, commenting that \\"there is no denying that Postal has some faults even when compared to some of the other games that were released around the same time as it, and time has definitely not been very kind to the title itself. But the concepts that the game explores, the ideas being expressed, and much of their actual implementations are just so interesting and compelling that one can still actually look past many of these faults and see the hidden gem that lies underneath.\\" The reviewer from Pyramid #30 (March/April, 1998) stated that \\"Many people have thought the premise for the game is sick. Well, it is. But, that's what makes it fun. There's no quest for secret, lost treasure. There's no time-clock ticking away as you try desperately to save the world. There's no alien spaceships or fantastical powers. There's just good old fashioned, psychotic violence - something that our mass media entertainment powers have been bringing us on prime time for years.\\"  References   External links   POSTAL 1 Open Source Category:1997 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Freeware games Category:Linux games Category:Loki Entertainment games Category:Mac OS games Category:MacOS games Category:Mass murder in fiction Category:Obscenity controversies in video games Category:Postal (video game series) Category:Run and gun games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games with expansion packs Category:Video games with isometric graphics Category:Windows games Category:Open-source video games Category:Commercial video games with freely available source code ","title":"Postal (video game)"},{"id":"1148047","text":"The Tasman River is an alpine braided river flowing through Canterbury, in New Zealand's South Island.

Accessed June 2011. It is filled with savory ingredients, most often minced meat or fish, and is served as an entr√©e, main course, or side dish. Variations =Europe= Rissoles from Savoy, France - Dessert of baked pear compote In Portugal, rissoles are known as riss√≥is (singular \\"rissol\\") and are a very popular snack that can be found in many cafes, barbecues, house parties, receptions, birthday parties and baptizeds parties. Riss√≥is are a breaded pastry shaped as half-moon, usually filled with shrimp in B√©chamel sauce and then deep fried. The most common fill is with shrimps, although meat (from pork or beef), hake, piglet, tuna, octopus, vegetable, cod, duck, cockle and spinach is often used too. Other and less common variations use chicken or a combination of cheese, normally slices of queijo Flamengo (flemish cheese) and cubes or slices of pork ham as a filling and therefore is a cheaper way of making Riss√≥is, in another hand on the more affluent social groups sometimes there are lobster or lobster and shrimps riss√≥is. Riss√≥is are usually eaten cold, as a snack or as an appetizer, but can also be a main course, usually served with salad or rice, the rice could be peas rice, tomato rice, carrot rice, beans rice or greens rice. Fried rissoles are common in the Republic of Ireland, especially in the county of Wexford, where boiled potatoes are mashed, mixed with herbs and spices, battered or breadcrumbed, and served with chips, chicken or battered sausages. Meat rissoles with potatoes Rissoles are sold in chip shops in south Wales, north-east England, and Yorkshire. Rissoles and chips are a common choice of meal. These rissoles are meat (typically beef), or fish in Yorkshire, mashed up with potato, herbs, and sometimes onion. They are coated in breadcrumbs or less frequently battered and deep-fried.Rissoles FoodsOfEngland.co.uk. Accessed July 2020. In Poland, rissoles are known as sznycle (singular \\"sznycel\\") and are very common in canteens, especially in schools. Eaten hot as the main part of the main course, sznycle are usually served with boiled potatoes (sometimes mashed) and vegetables. The stuffing is always minced meat. Other variations use chicken or a combination of cheese and ham as a filling. In some regions where the name denotes a Wiener schnitzel, the term kotlet siekany (literally: \\"chopped cutlet\\") is used instead. In France, rissoles are served as a dessert cooked in the Savoy region. They are made of pears in batter and are baked, not fried. =South America= In Brazil, they are often filled with heart of palm, cheese, ham, ground meat, chicken or shrimp. =Australia and New Zealand= Australian rissoles, cooked and cut in half This form of rissole is very similar to a hamburger patty and is made from minced meat without a pastry covering, resembling an irregular meatball. An Australian and New Zealand rissole usually contains more ingredients than a hamburger, almost always using breadcrumbs but many Australians and New Zealanders have their own family recipe which may also include onion, finely grated herbs and vegetables, sauces, salt, and spices. Rissoles are usually made from beef, chicken or lamb. Basing the rissoles on ingredients such as tuna, and pumpkin is also possible. They are cooked in a pan or on a barbecue, and are usually eaten hot as part of a meal. Australian rissoles are not usually eaten hot between bread with salad or cheese. If they are they will usually be called hamburger patties (despite differences between the two types of patty) however cold rissoles are frequently eaten as a sandwich filling the next day. The Australian rissole became popular during both World Wars as a means of stretching meat rationing set by the Australian government. Rissoles were made by butchers and housewives to use offcuts of meat, then finely minced with the adding of leftover bread crumbs, abundant flour, eggs and vegetables/herbs to improve the flavour. The Australian rissole has evolved over the past 100 years with some Australian families having special recipes and secret ingredients including; beer, Vegemite, peanut butter, cornflakes, carrot, chilli and spices. =Indonesia= Vendor selling rissoles at the pasar malam (night market) in Rawasari, Jakarta Rissole is a snack food in Indonesia, where they are called risoles (pronounced 'riss-ol-less') or just risol. The skin is made from batter in the same fashion as flat crepes. They are commonly filled with bechamel, chicken, and diced vegetables - including carrot, celery, common beans and potato.

Schoolies or schoolies week (also known as leavers' or leavers' week in Queensland Surfers Paradise and Western Australia and coasties in the Australian Capital Territory) refers to the Australian tradition of high-school graduates (also known as \\"schoolies\\" or \\"leavers\\") having week-long holidays following the end of their final exams in late November and early December. \\"Toolies\\" refers to older revellers who participate in Schoolies week but are not high-school graduates. \\"Foolies\\" refers to younger adolescents, who participate in Schoolies week but have not yet graduated from high school. Schoolies week is seen as a final party with schoolmates before they head their separate ways. History Schoolies week first began on the Gold Coast, Queensland in the late 1970s, in the week following final exams for private single-sex schools. The Broadbeach Hotel was the main meeting place. Schoolies Week events began to be organised for 1980, and from then on the Gold Coast attracted schoolies from all over Australia for celebrations. Since then, the tradition has spread, and Australian high-school graduates celebrate their graduation with a week-long party at many popular tourist destinations around the country. Schoolies week is considered by many teenagers in Australia as a cultural rite of passage. Schoolies week is seen as transitional period from youth to adulthood, marking a change of state from the imposition of school discipline to the chosen freedom to have a body which is out of control. According to the Official National Schoolies Week Website, \\"The most-enduring Schoolies-week tradition is the first run down the beach and dive into the ocean after school is finished forever. That plunge of freedom is the essence of freedom which Schoolies symbolises.\\" Locations Queensland's Gold Coast, particularly Surfers Paradise, maintains its status as the largest single venue for this revelry, attracting tens of thousands of schoolies. The Gold Coast is viewed as a liminal space, somewhere to get away, a city of theme parks and leisure by the sea where transitions are possible. Research carried out in 2003 found schoolies boosted the Gold Coast economy by $59 million. In 2011, up to 40,000 students were expected to visit the Gold Coast. Schoolies are also present on the Sunshine Coast; this is an alternative for the graduates who fear the negative media attention attracted on the Gold Coast.http://www.schoolies.com/sunshine-coast/ According to the Sunshine Coast Region council the Sunshine Coast had about 500 schoolies visit in 2009. The local council on the Sunshine Coast stopped providing events for schoolies in 2007. Schoolies have similar traditions at Magnetic Island in Townsville, Airlie Beach in the Whitsundays and Port Macquarie. Byron Bay and Surfers Paradise are particularly popular amongst private school graduates. For South Australia, Victor Harbor is the location of choice, while in Victoria the Surf Coast is popular, mainly consisting of Lorne and Torquay, however Phillip Island is also quite popular for students living in the east and south of Victoria. At Victor Harbor in 2011, approximately 15,000 students were expected to celebrate. In Western Australia, Rottnest Island off Perth and the South West towns of Dunsborough and Busselton are popular destinations. Also, Western Australians often go to Bali, which is located in Indonesia, as it is a spot for parties, late nights, and cheap shopping. In Tasmania there is not an established \\"Schoolies\\" location or tradition as such. Internationally, popular schoolies destinations include Fiji and Vanuatu. In Fiji, whole islands have been dedicated to schoolie celebrations. Official Schoolies events Official Schoolies events are drug-free and alcohol-free events held at many Schoolies destinations. They include concerts, dances and parties. For all official events, attendees are required to be a registered schoolie and present a schoolie ID on entry. This schoolie ID, which at some locations includes a photo, is given to each schoolie upon registering, which requires the presentation of a current school ID and incurs a small fee. At many destinations, the official events are held in fenced-off areas or in nightclubs to prevent the infiltration of \\"toolies\\" and to maintain crowd control. Some events are free, while others (often those held at nightclubs) incur an entry fee. Toolies and foolies Popular schoolies (or leavers) venues are often attended by people well past school age, labelled by the media as \\"toolies\\"Coastal towns keen to welcome schoolies, but not the toolies. Herald Sun. 20 November 2009. or \\"droolies\\". Toolies are associated with the targeting of drunk teenagers for sex, and are also frequently involved in disturbances taking place during the celebrations. Because of this, toolies are a major topic of media scrutiny during Schoolies week. Toolies also refers to early school leavers who are in apprenticeship training but join in the Schoolies celebrations. Another group that have some presence at Schoolies week celebrations are those known as \\"foolies\\" or \\"pre- schoolies\\". These are adolescents who have not yet left school but still partake in activities during Schoolies week. Many organised events during Schoolies week, such as concerts, only admit those who are school leavers. On the Gold Coast in particular, Schoolies are often given wristbands as a form of identification.  Criticism  Since the event began to attract large enough numbers to warrant annual media attention, Schoolies week has become a familiar concept nationwide. The media have represented the event as a period of lawlessness, loutish behaviour and unruliness. Some local residents and media have criticised the event due to binge drinking, and sexual promiscuity. Police attention is regularly required where the collective behaviour of schoolies at some locations gets out of hand, such as at Rottnest Island in 1986. In efforts to reduce such acts, the week-long event on Rottnest Island in Western Australia has, as of 2006, been reduced to three days, which itself has resulted in a fair amount of criticism from young members of the public. In recent years, violence (notably sexual violence) has become an increased threat to the safety of attendees. Fights have broken out between schoolies from one area and another(6 January 2003). Schoolies Week Review. AM. Transcript. Australian Broadcasting Corporation. and predictable media coverage of antics, accidents, and attacks has followed. The Queensland Government has been criticised for their efforts to stage-manage the event and limit celebrations. 2009 saw one of the most troublesome Gold Coast Schoolies celebrations in history, where in one night, police arrested 30 schoolies, and the number of arrests for the entire week doubled compared to the previous year. Superintendent Jim Keogh said that during eight days of 2009 schoolies celebrations, 217 schoolies had been arrested on 244 charges, compared with 94 schoolies arrested for the same period in 2006. Charges were laid against schoolies for serious assault, drunk and disorderly conduct, drug possession and obstructing police. The incidents prompted talks of banning Schoolies week. This has led schoolies to look at safer alternatives to ensure their wellbeing.  Problems and risks  Schoolies week celebrations can involve large volumes of alcohol and other drugs such as tobacco, cannabis and ecstasy. Confrontations between participants can occur resulting in violent assaults. Other problems and risk associated with schoolies week include sexual health and sexual assault. In 2010, the Queensland Police made 145 arrests of school leavers on the Gold Coast, down from the 220 arrests made in 2009. =Alcohol and other drugs= Widely considered a week long alcohol binge, schoolies week is most criticised for excessive drinking and problems that flow from this. A 2010 study found that almost two-thirds of schoolies will consume more than ten drinks per night. The survey also revealed that most of the teenagers surveyed rated the experience negatively afterwards. More recently laws have been changed at a Federal level increasing the tax on pre-mixed spirits, and at a state level in Queensland to focus on parents supplying alcohol to their children in an irresponsible way. Drink spiking has also been a significant problem. The availability of drugs at Schoolies week has also been a problem . In 2011 25% of male schoolies and 14% of females reported being stoned most or every day or night of Schoolies week. = Sex = Sexual health has been made a focus since opportunities for casual sex at schoolies week can lead to unprotected sex and the propagation of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). There are also concerns about sexual activity in public places such as beaches. Increases in sexual assaults during schoolies week destinations has also been a problem. A 2010 study found that one-third of males were expecting to have sex with multiple partners. =Violence= Schoolies has been long known for its violence, and media reporting has often focused on schoolies violence. In the mid-1990s there were incidents where news crews handed out money for schoolies to initiate violence so they could film schoolies violence for the evening news. In 1996, the Gold Coast City Council began to increase regulation of events and spaces. One of the most violent Schoolies was in 2002 at the Gold Coast. Police were under- resourced, as several violent clashes occurred involving groups of people every night that week. In subsequent years with police numbers significantly increased and innovative approaches developed, the violence has continued, but police have rapidly engaged and resolved violence. When the Queensland Government took over the management of Schoolies at the Gold Coast in 2003 from the Gold Coast City Council, after the most violent Schoolies week in 2002, their primary concern was public perceptions of Schoolies week. Schoolies destinations have been more heavily policed since, and some destinations have engaged private security guards to assist. The most significant statistic regarding violence at schoolies over the past few decades has placed the blame more so in the hands of 'toolies' than 'schoolies' themselves. Damage to hotel rooms has occurred, as well as vandalism to other private and public property. = Injuries and death = In 2002, the Queensland Government established a triage to treat and assess injuries and implement first aid. There have been a number of schoolies- related deaths and many violent altercations between youths. In one case death resulting from balcony fall in 2010 which has been claimed to be from planking. Red Frogs network The event is supported by an all-volunteer group of Christians who are recruited into the Red Frogs network. Around 1,500 volunteers serve in 17 locations across Australia. The group aims to directly support partying school-leavers through a positive presence. This might involve walking them home, cleaning or cooking for them. The network began at the Gold Coast in 1997.

The river and the Bealey settlement are named for Samuel Bealey, a 19th-century Superintendent of Canterbury Province and pastoralist. Locomotive dumpsite In the first half of the 20th century, the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) dumped a number of withdrawn locomotives and wagons in the river to stabilise its banks and prevent erosion, particularly near the railway bridge across the Bealey River. Some of these locomotives and wagons have been recovered by heritage groups with the aim of restoring them to operating condition, including WMR No. 9 (later NZR N 453) by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Trust in 2003.Wellington and Manawatu Railway Trust: Stage I - Salvage Most of the other locomotives and components have since been either buried or scrapped. The more substantially complete remains of ex-WMR No. 10 (later NZR N 454) are believed to be buried in the river bed near Cora Lynn, further up the river. During the early 1920s, NZR used a former quarry near Cora Lynn station as an open-air workshop to strip locomotives of useful parts before they were dumped. This quarry was host to a number of locomotive parts including the frame of V 132, which had been retrofitted with Walschaerts valve gear in 1898 as an experiment by NZR. Shortly after this frame was salvaged in 1997‚Äì98, Tranz Rail and the Department of Conservation initiated a clean-up operation in the old quarry, burying many of the locomotive parts there into the access embankment. Similarly, NZR used the Bealey River as a place to scrap old wooden passenger coaches in the 1950s and 1960s. These carriages would be brought from Addington Railway Workshops in Christchurch, shunted into the riverbed, and then burnt to recover their metal parts for scrap or as spares for other operating vehicles. =Other locomotive dumps= *Branxholme *M≈çkihinui River *Oamaru *Omoto *Waimakariri River *Westfield *Mararoa  References  Category:Rivers of Canterbury, New Zealand Category:Rivers of New Zealand ","title":"Bealey River"},{"id":"1148074","text":"List of Hebrew language poets (year links are to corresponding \\"[year] in poetry\\" article): Biblical * Moses * King David * King Solomon * Jeremiah Early Middle Ages * Eleazar ha-Kalir * Jose b.

Early life  Born in South Bend, Indiana, Leo grew up in Bloomfield, New Jersey, where his family was from, and spent many formative years in the hardcore punk scene of New York City during the 1980s and early 1990s. He graduated from Seton Hall Preparatory School in West Orange in 1988 and the University of Notre Dame in the fall of 1993 with a degree in English.  Career  Scott Miller button Leo was a founding member of the New York punk band Citizens Arrest in 1989. In the 1990s, Leo played in bands that included Chisel, Puzzlehead and the Sin-Eaters. Ted Leo and the Pharmacists was formed in 1999 in Washington, D.C. The group recorded six studio albums between 1999 and 2010. Leo has also maintained a consistent presence as a solo performer since the 1990s. In early 2013, Leo and Aimee Mann formed a duo called The Both, after Leo had toured with Mann for several months as her supporting act. He and Mann began writing songs together, and in March 2013, the duo performed their first show together as the Both (originally formatted as the hashtag #BOTH). Their self-titled debut album, The Both, was released in April 2014. Leo released his debut solo album The Hanged Man on September 8, 2017. The album was inspired by several years of career and personal hardships, including the loss of a daughter in 2011 due to a late-term miscarriage in which Leo's wife was forced to go into premature labor. For the 2019 animated television film Steven Universe: The Movie, Leo collaborated with Rebecca Sugar and Stemage to write the song \\"Independent Together\\". In the film, Leo voiced the role of Steg, a fusion of Steven Universe and Greg Universe. As Steg, Leo performed \\"Independent Together\\" alongside Mann (who reprised her role as Opal from the Steven Universe television series) and voice actress Deedee Magno Hall (as Pearl). Family and personal life Leo grew up in New Jersey before moving to South Bend to attend Notre Dame, where he formed Chisel. He then moved to D.C., and briefly moved to Boston thereafter. Leo has lived in Rhode Island since 2005, and he also maintained an apartment in New York City until 2016. Leo met his wife, musician and visual artist Jodi Buonanno, in the late 1990s when both were touring in bands. She is credited with clapping, whistle, and background vocals on the Hearts of Oak album. His brothers, Chris and Danny Leo, are also singer- songwriters, and have been members of bands such as Native Nod, the Lapse, the Van Pelt, Vague Angels and Holy Childhood. Leo is a vegan, and has served as a spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. He has made frequent radio appearances as a contributor to programs on WFMU, such as The Best Show with Tom Scharpling.

Currently, the most widely accepted explanation for their origin is in the context of cosmic inflation. According to the inflationary paradigm, the exponential growth of the scale factor during inflation caused quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field to be stretched to macroscopic scales, and, upon leaving the horizon, to \\"freeze in\\". At the later stages of radiation- and matter-domination, these fluctuations re-entered the horizon, and thus set the initial conditions for structure formation. The statistical properties of the primordial fluctuations can be inferred from observations of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and from measurements of the distribution of matter, e.g., galaxy redshift surveys. Since the fluctuations are believed to arise from inflation, such measurements can also set constraints on parameters within inflationary theory. Formalism Primordial fluctuations are typically quantified by a power spectrum which gives the power of the variations as a function of spatial scale. Within this formalism, one usually considers the fractional energy density of the fluctuations, given by: :\\\\delta(\\\\vec{x}) \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\rho(\\\\vec{x})}{\\\\bar{\\\\rho}} - 1 = \\\\int \\\\text{d}k \\\\; \\\\delta_k \\\\, e^{i\\\\vec{k} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{x}}, where \\\\rho is the energy density, \\\\bar{\\\\rho} its average and k the wavenumber of the fluctuations. The power spectrum \\\\mathcal{P}(k) can then be defined via the ensemble average of the Fourier components: : \\\\langle \\\\delta_k \\\\delta_{k'} \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi^2}{k^3} \\\\, \\\\delta(k-k') \\\\, \\\\mathcal{P}(k). There are both scalar and tensor modes of fluctuations. =Scalar modes= Scalar modes have the power spectrum :\\\\mathcal{P}_\\\\mathrm{s}(k) = \\\\delta_R^2. Many inflationary models predict that the scalar component of the fluctuations obeys a power law in which :\\\\mathcal{P}_\\\\mathrm{s}(k) \\\\propto k^{n_\\\\mathrm{s} - 1}. For scalar fluctuations, n_\\\\mathrm{s} is referred to as the scalar spectral index, with n_\\\\mathrm{s} = 1 corresponding to scale invariant fluctuations. The scalar spectral index describes how the density fluctuations vary with scale. As the size of these fluctuations depends upon the inflaton's motion when these quantum fluctuations are becoming super-horizon sized, different inflationary potentials predict different spectral indices. These depend upon the slow roll parameters, in particular the gradient and curvature of the potential. In models where the curvature is large and positive n_s > 1. On the other hand, models such as monomial potentials predict a red spectral index n_s < 1. Planck provides a value of n_s of 0.96. =Tensor modes= The presence of primordial tensor fluctuations is predicted by many inflationary models. As with scalar fluctuations, tensor fluctuations are expected to follow a power law and are parameterized by the tensor index (the tensor version of the scalar index). The ratio of the tensor to scalar power spectra is given by :r=\\\\frac{2\\\\delta_h^2}{\\\\delta_R^2}, where the 2 arises due to the two polarizations of the tensor modes. 2015 CMB data from the Planck satellite gives a constraint of r<0.11. Adiabatic/isocurvature fluctuations Adiabatic fluctuations are density variations in all forms of matter and energy which have equal fractional over/under densities in the number density. So for example, an adiabatic photon overdensity of a factor of two in the number density would also correspond to an electron overdensity of two. For isocurvature fluctuations, the number density variations for one component do not necessarily correspond to number density variations in other components. While it is usually assumed that the initial fluctuations are adiabatic, the possibility of isocurvature fluctuations can be considered given current cosmological data. Current cosmic microwave background data favor adiabatic fluctuations and constrain uncorrelated isocurvature cold dark matter modes to be small.

The church in Elduv√≠k dates from 1952. Visible from Elduv√≠k is the nearby island of Kalsoy. The legend of Marmennil Marmennil - The Little Merman Stamp FR 310 of Postverk F√∏roya by William Heinesen, 20 May 1997 Anfinnur was a farmer in Elduv√≠k and the legend concerns his encounter with a beast called Marmennil. According to the legend, Marmennil has the appearance of a small human with long fingers, and lives at the bottom of the sea. He would tease fishermen by eating their bait, then attaching their hooks to the sea bed so that they would break their fishing lines. One day, however, Marmennil was fixing Anfinnur's hook to the bottom when the hook became fixed in his hand, and he was pulled up into Anfinnur's boat. The fishermen in the boat made the sign of the cross, and then brought Marmennil home with them. He proved to be very useful on their fishing trips, so they always took him with them, remembering always to make the sign of the cross on him when he was taken on board. As soon as there were fish under the boat, Marmennil would start to laugh and play, and the fishermen could then make their catch. Anfinnur kept Marmennil for a long time, but one day the sea was so rough that they forgot to make the sign of the cross. Because of this, when they were afloat, Marmennil sneaked overboard into the sea and was never seen again.

It has a population of around 100.Hagstova.fo  Name  Tradition says that F√°mjin used to be called Vesturvik. One day two men from the village were out on the sea fishing from their boat. There they saw a French sailship just lying there waiting for wind. The two men invited two ladies into their boat to see a large halibut. When the ladies were on board the men quickly rowed towards their village with them. From the sail-ship they heard the Frenchmen shout \\"Femmes ... Femmes\\". After that day Vesturvik was called F√°mjin. These things are said to have happened in the 16th century. Geography The village of F√°mjin is looking directly out to the harsh sea, although partly protected by a stone reef, which becomes visible at low tide. The village is surrounded by the beautiful natural scenery of the highest mountains on Su√∞uroy. The highest mountain, Gluggarnir is located north of F√°mjin. The mountains Borgarknappur and Borgin are south-east of the village. There are several inland lakes and waterfalls. One of the waterfalls is named Fossurin Mikli. Only one road leads to the village, it goes through √òrav√≠k. North of the village lies the ‚ÄúKirkjuvatn‚Äù (Church Lake), one of the largest on the island. The old mountain path between F√°mjin and V√°gur was originally the main road between the two villages. There are cairns along the path. West of F√°mjin by the end of the road is a gorge which is called Prestgj√≥gv (The Priest's Gorge). F√°mjin is 9 km west of √òrav√≠k, which is on the west coast. √òrav√≠k is located on the east coast, around 3 km south of Krambatangi ferry port. The distance from F√°mjin to Tv√∏royri is 16 km. The distance from F√°mjin to V√°gur is 29 km.Landsverk.fo  History  The church in F√°mjin was built in 1875, it was ready to use in 1876. In the church there is a runestone from the 16th century (see F√°mjin stone) (Faroese: F√°mjinssteinurin). The stone bears both Latin and Runic letters. The stone is dated to the time after the Faroese reformation in 1538, and proves that runes were used up to as late as the 16th century. It is the youngest of the Faroese runestones. In the church is the prototype of the Faroese flag Merki√∞. This flag was made by Jens Oliver Lisberg from F√°mjin and others while they were studying in Copenhagen in Denmark in 1919. The first time \\"Merki√∞\\" was used in the Faroe Islands, was on June 22, 1919 in Famjin, the occasion was a wedding. Merki√∞ was not officially recognized in the beginning. However during World War II, the United Kingdom prohibited the use of the flag of Denmark on Faroese ships as Denmark was at that time occupied by Germany. Therefore Merki√∞ was run up on the ships instead. (April 25, 1940 is the official date of recognition) Not until the verification of the home rule act in 1948 was Merki√∞ recognized as the official flag of the Faroe Islands.  Culture  F√°mjin is well situated near rich fishing grounds. In the harbor, which is well-protected by the natural environment, the fishing boats moor in the summer at a small wharf. During the winter the boats are pulled in from the quay and kept in boat houses nearby. As in other villages both fishing and sheep farming is a part of the daily routine. The sheep are gathered and led to slaughter in October. During the summer months, however, the population increases significantly due to the many people from F√°mjin who live in other villages on the Faroe Islands and in other countries, but return in the sheep herding and hay season, which takes place from the beginning of July to the end of August. This is the case in many small Faroese villages. The past years the number of tourists who visit the village has been increasing. The tourists come especially for one reason, they wish to see the original Faroese flag, Merki√∞, which is hanging inside the church. There are some houses for rent and a coffeeshop is next to the harbour. Tourists enjoy also to go for a walk up the hill behind the church to the lake Kirkjuvatn. The name means The Lake of the Church.

Tradition says that Fro√∞ba is the oldest village on Su√∞uroy and in the Faroe Islands. A legendary Danish king, Frode or Fr√≥√∞i, ran ashore and settled here. The place is named after him. The name Fro√∞ba was originally Fr√≥√∞ab√¶, in Norse, which means Frode-village or settlement. The name \\"Fr√≥√∞ab√¶\\" has changed to \\"Fro√∞ab√∏\\" and finally \\"Fro√∞aba\\" and Fro√∞ba; the Faroese word b√∏ translates into place, dwelling, settlement or village in English.

This long-held tenet was broken in 2005, when Jason Todd returned to life as the Red Hood and Bucky was reported to have survived the accident that seemingly killed him, brought back in 2005 as the Winter Soldier, remaining in the shadows for decades. Barnes apparently died again in 2011 after a short tenure as Captain America, only to be revived by Nick Fury's Infinity Formula.Fear Itself #7.1 (2011), Marvel Comics. Because death in American super-hero comics is so often temporary, readers rarely take the death of a character seriously; when a character dies, readers feel very little sense of loss, and are simply left wondering how long it will be before they return to life. Notable examples Although several comic book deaths are well-known, two of the best-known are the 1980 \\"death\\" of Jean Grey in Marvel's \\"Dark Phoenix Saga\\" and that of Superman in DC's highly publicized 1993 \\"Death of Superman\\" storyline. There is one major distinction between the two, however‚Äîwhereas it was never intended that Superman's death be permanent, but rather that he would return to life at the conclusion of the story, Jean's passing was intended to be permanent, as the editor Jim Shooter felt that would be the only satisfactory outcome given that she had committed mass murder.\\"The Dark Phoenix Tapes\\", Phoenix: The Untold Story #1 (April 1984) Despite this, the story was retconned a few years later to facilitate Jean's return. In 2007, the death of Captain America made real- world headlines when he met his apparent end, but Steve Rogers returned in Captain America: Reborn in late 2009. Planters cited comic book deaths (particularly those adapted in the Marvel Cinematic Universe) as the inspiration for a storyline killing off its century-old mascot Mr. Peanut in January 2020 and having him reborn as a baby the next month. In-universe acknowledgement Comic book characters themselves have made comments about the frequency of resurrections. Professor X has commented \\"in mutant heaven there are no pearly gates, but instead revolving doors.\\"X-Factor #70 page 17, panel 1 When Siryn was made aware of her father's death, she refused to mourn him, giddily claiming that since her father has died as an X-Man, he was likely going to be soon resurrected, shocking her friends.David, Peter (w), Olivetti, Ariel (a). \\"Two Meetings, One In Person, One Not\\", X-Factor (vol 3) #7 (July 2006).

This prinia is a resident breeder in Northeast Africa (the Nile valley in particular) and southern Asia, from Egypt and Somalia east to Pakistan and North India, where it is sometimes called streaked wren-warbler. This active passerine bird is typically found in shrub or tall grass in a variety of habitats with thick undergrowth, tamarisks or similar cover. Graceful prinia builds its nest in a bush or grass and lays 3-5 eggs. These 10‚Äì11 cm long warblers have short rounded wings, and a long tapering tail with each feather tipped with black and white. In breeding plumage, adults are grey-brown above, with dark streaking. The underparts are whitish with buff flanks, and the bill is short and black. The sexes are similar. In winter, adults are brighter sandy brown above with weaker streaking, there is more buff on the sides, and the bill is paler. There are 12 subspecies, of which P. g. akyildizi, of southern Turkey is the darkest, brownest, and most heavily streaked above, and has the brightest buff flanks. The long tail is often cocked, and the flight of this species is weak. Like most warblers, graceful prinia is insectivorous. The call is a rolling trilled breep, and the song is a hard rolling repletion of zerlip.

It is part of the Greater Concepci√≥n conurbation. Talcahuano is located in the south of the Central Zone of Chile. Geography Together with ten other municipalities, it forms part of the Concepci√≥n Province, which in turn is one of four provinces that forms the VIII Region of Biob√≠o Region. Demographics According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Talcahuano spans an area of and has 250,348 inhabitants (121,778 men and 128,570 women). Of these, 248,964 (99.4%) lived in urban areas and 1,384 (0.6%) in rural areas. The population grew by 59.9% (93,766 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. With a population density of 1,873 inhabitants per square kilometre, it is the seventh most populated city of the country.  History  The official foundation date of Talcahuano is 5 November 1764 when Antonio Guill y Gonzaga declared it an official port. However, the site of Talcahuano began to appear in history books as early as 1544 when Genoese captain Juan Bautista Pastene discovered the mouth of the Biob√≠o river while exploring the coast in his ships \\"San Pedro\\" and \\"Santiaguillo\\". In 1601 Alonso de Ribera built Fort Talcahueno to defend remaining Spanish settlements near Concepci√≥n. The city is named after an Araucanian chief, Talcahue√±u, who inhabited the region at the arrival of the Spanish. In Mapudungun, the language of the indigenous Mapuches, Talcahuano means \\"Thundering Sky\\". The port was well known to American whaleships of the 19th century. They often put in for fresh water, food, and various forms of entertainment for the crews. On 24 January 1939 at around 23.33 the city was hit by a major earthquake of 8.3 which had an epicenter close to the city of Chill√°n. The Chilean Government requested from the British Government the help of two British cruisers HMS Ajax (22) and HMS Exeter (68) then visiting the city of Valpara√≠so to head south to investigate. The ships arrived at Talcahuano on 25th, many of the city's main buildings had been destroyed with little power, food or water available to the survivors. The two ships crews helped with rubble clearing, rescuing those still trapped, recovering bodies as well as the ships taking trips north to Valparaiso with those injured and refugees.Holman, D. The Man They Couldn't Kill London 1960 pp44-46 The 2010 tsunami carried this fishing boat ashore. =27 February 2010 earthquake= On 27 February 2010 Talcahuano was devastated by the 8.8 magnitude 2010 Chile earthquake and its subsequent tsunami. These back-to-back disasters left 80% of the city's residents homeless. The tsunami is estimated to have been more than 7.5 feet high. After a week, there are only 20 reported deaths, and 18 missing. The city government estimates that it will take 10 years to recover from the quake and tsunami. The local government has been turning away tent aid, as they want to make permanent shelters rather than have permanent tent camps.  Economy  Talcahuano contains Chile's Productive development Pillar of the development of the city, the productive activities represent the motor of the advance of Talcahuano in a globalized world. From tourism, our marine gastronomy, the nautical qualities of the bay, to industry, trade in services, products and the logistics platform. Talcahuano is an integral city that grows hand in hand with the spirit of its inhabitants. main naval base which is home of the historical relic, the Hu√°scar, a Peruvian ironclad ship (British-made), which was captured in 1879 during the War of the Pacific. It is also the base of the Chilean submarine fleet and the ASMAR shipyard. Administration As a commune, Talcahuano is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008‚Äì2012 alcalde is Gast√≥n Saavedra Chand√≠a (Ind.). The commune of Talcahuano has seventeen districts, the three most populous being Carriel, San Vicente and San Miguel, which together account for about 46% of the population of the commune.

It is located 15 km east of Belleville, Ontario, roughly midway between Toronto and Montreal, Quebec, near Highway 401 and along the former Provincial Highway 2. It has many configurations, and its tight layout with much run-off space makes it a very good venue for race testing. Many race teams from Toronto and Montreal test at Shannonville in preparation for events held on street circuits, as the Shannonville raceway shares a lot of the same characteristics. The raceway first started off as a dirt oval, with bedrock for a front straight. Much later, the 1.8 km \\"Nelson\\" circuit was built, named after the late John Nelson, owner of the circuit at the time. From there, the 2.23 km \\"Fabi\\" circuit was built north of the Nelson, and the two were linked to form the 4.03 km, 14-corner \\"Long Track\\". The Fabi circuit was named after Bertrand Fabi, a young Canadian driver who died while testing a Formula 3 car in England. The Fabi circuit has a long backstraight that now doubles as a drag strip. A link was then made after the first corner on the Nelson circuit to the seventh corner of the Long Circuit, creating the 2.47 km \\"Pro Circuit\\" layout. Currently, the Canadian Touring Car Championship makes an annual visit to the facility, as well as auto-racing body CASC (Regional Road Races). Drag racing is also heavily featured there.

He was unofficially entrusted with the task of upholding his family's tradition after the dissolution of the Strauss Orchestra by his father in 1901. His talents were not fully realized during his lifetime as musical tastes had changed in the Silver Age with more popular composers such as Franz Leh√°r and Oscar Straus dominating the Viennese musical scene with their operettas, although his uncle, Johann Strauss II, supervised his development as a musician, a fact disputed by Eduard Strauss. Arrival of Johan Strauss III and his orchestra in The Hague in 1929 Baton of Johann Strauss III in the Strauss Museum Vienna Despite his keen interest in composing, he was better remembered as a conductor. His only stage work, the three-act operetta Katze und Maus, composed in 1898, premiered in Vienna on 23 December 1898, at the Theater an der Wien. Its public reaction bordered on utter dislike, and music critics called for the distraught composer to reassess himself and to appear under a pseudonym, in order not to tarnish the name of his famous relatives. He salvaged the music score and produced independent pieces of which the waltzes Sylvanien, Op. 1 and Leonie, Op. 2 survived obscurity. He also conducted from the violin in the style of the Vorgeiger and of his family. In 1903, he elevated the Strauss family to a new age of development when the Deutsche Grammophon AG of Germany recorded his conducting of the Johann Strauss Orchestra on eight single-sided records of works by his family. Principally, he was the first conductor in the Strauss family to actively conduct works to be recorded by prominent recording companies. His later works, such as Dem Muthigen geh√∂rt die Welt (The World Belongs to the Brave), Op. 25, Unter den Linden (Under the Linden Trees), Op. 30, and Kr√∂nungs-Walzer (Coronation Waltz), Op. 40 (the latter celebrating the coronation of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom), were also considerably more popular than his earlier efforts.

Polyhedral nets are a useful aid to the study of polyhedra and solid geometry in general, as they allow for physical models of polyhedra to be constructed from material such as thin cardboard. An early instance of polyhedral nets appears in the works of Albrecht D√ºrer, whose 1525 book A Course in the Art of Measurement with Compass and Ruler (Unterweysung der Messung mit dem Zyrkel und Rychtscheyd ) included nets for the Platonic solids and several of the Archimedean solids.A. D√ºrer, Unterweysung der Messung mit dem Zyrkel und Rychtscheyd. N√ºrnberg (1525). English translation with commentary by Walter L. Strauss The Painter's Manual, New York (1977). See pp. 139‚Äì152. These constructions were first called nets in 1543 by Augustin Hirschvogel. Existence and uniqueness Many different nets can exist for a given polyhedron, depending on the choices of which edges are joined and which are separated. The edges that are cut from a convex polyhedron to form a net must form a spanning tree of the polyhedron, but cutting some spanning trees may cause the polyhedron to self-overlap when unfolded, rather than forming a net. Conversely, a given net may fold into more than one different convex polyhedron, depending on the angles at which its edges are folded and the choice of which edges to glue together. If a net is given together with a pattern for gluing its edges together, such that each vertex of the resulting shape has positive angular defect and such that the sum of these defects is exactly 4, then there necessarily exists exactly one polyhedron that can be folded from it; this is Alexandrov's uniqueness theorem. However, the polyhedron formed in this way may have different faces than the ones specified as part of the net: some of the net polygons may have folds across them, and some of the edges between net polygons may remain unfolded. Additionally, the same net may have multiple valid gluing patterns, leading to different folded polyhedra. In 1975, G. C. Shephard asked whether every convex polyhedron has at least one net, or simple edge-unfolding. This question, which is also known as D√ºrer's conjecture, or D√ºrer's unfolding problem, remains unanswered. There exist non-convex polyhedra that do not have nets, and it is possible to subdivide the faces of every convex polyhedron (for instance along a cut locus) so that the set of subdivided faces has a net. In 2014 Mohammad Ghomi showed that every convex polyhedron admits a net after an affine transformation. Furthermore in 2019 Barvinok and Ghomi showed that a generalization of D√ºrer's conjecture fails for pseudo edges , i.e., a network of geodesics which connect vertices of the polyhedron and form a graph with convex faces. Shortest path The shortest path over the surface between two points on the surface of a polyhedron corresponds to a straight line on a suitable net for the subset of faces touched by the path. The net has to be such that the straight line is fully within it, and one may have to consider several nets to see which gives the shortest path. For example, in the case of a cube, if the points are on adjacent faces one candidate for the shortest path is the path crossing the common edge; the shortest path of this kind is found using a net where the two faces are also adjacent. Other candidates for the shortest path are through the surface of a third face adjacent to both (of which there are two), and corresponding nets can be used to find the shortest path in each category. The spider and the fly problem is a recreational mathematics puzzle which involves finding the shortest path between two points on a cuboid.  Higher-dimensional polytope nets  Dal√≠ cross, a net for the tesseract A net of a 4-polytope, a four-dimensional polytope, is composed of polyhedral cells that are connected by their faces and all occupy the same three-dimensional space, just as the polygon faces of a net of a polyhedron are connected by their edges and all occupy the same plane. The net of the tesseract, the four-dimensional hypercube, is used prominently in a painting by Salvador Dal√≠, Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus) (1954). The same tesseract net is central to the plot of the short story \\"‚ÄîAnd He Built a Crooked House‚Äî\\" by Robert A. Heinlein.

Foundation  The founder and spiritual head of the Hurufi movement was Fazlallah Astarabadi (1340‚Äì94). Born in Astrabad (now Gorgan, Iran), he was strongly drawn to Sufism and the teachings of Mansur Al-Hallaj and Rumi at an early age. In the mid-1370s, Fazlallah started to propagate his teachings all over Iran and Azerbaijan. While living in Tabriz, Fazlallah gained an elite following in the court of the Jalairid Sultanate. At that time, Fazlallah was still in the mainstream of Sufi tradition. Later, he did move towards more esoteric spirituality, and, failing to convert Timur, was executed in 1394 near Alinja Tower in Nakhchivan by the ruler's son, Miran Shah. The large uprising of Hurufis was crushed, but the popular movement survived for another decade or so in different guises. Fazlallah's greatest work was the JƒÅvdƒÅnnƒÅme-ye kabir or \\"Great Book of Eternity\\", likely written in Baku before his arrest, which survived due to its dissemination due to copies made by his daughter MakhdumzƒÅde. It was largely preserved in popular culture due to its use by dervishes of the Bektashi Order.  Key elements  According to Fazlallah, the key to open seventh sealed book, the Qur æan, is a kabbalistic system of letters that is expounded by later Hurufis in the Hidayat Namah, Jawidan and in the Mahram Namah. The Universe is eternal and moves by rotation. Divine countenance is imperishable and is manifest in Man, the best of forms, zuhur kibriya. God is incarnated in every atom. Hurufis considered Fazlallah Astarabadi a manifestation of God's force after Adam, Moses and Muhammad. God is also embodied in words and the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet, and the 32 letters of the Persian alphabet are the basis for love and beauty in the world. Seven is a key number corresponding to noble parts of the face, the verses of Al-Fatiha and verbal confession of faith. Man is a supreme copy of the divine and the key to haqiqa. According to R. N. Frye's The Cambridge History of Iran, Hurufism was an expression of Isma'ilism in its mystical identification of human figure but differed in its recognition of haqiqa in the substance of letters rather than in the person of the Imam.  Impact  After his death, Fazlallah's ideas were developed and propagated by Imadaddin Nasimi and the \\"certain accursed ones of no significance\\" in Azerbaijan and Seyid Ishag in Turkey. The poet Imadaddin Nasimi (?‚Äì1417) and other Hurufis make kabbalistic tendencies subordinate to mystic concepts of Sufism, and specifically those of Mansur Al-Hallaj, who was another great influence on Imadaddin Nasimi. Through Nasimi's poetry, Hurufi ideas influenced, in different degrees, people like Niyaz-i Misri, Fuz√ªl√Æ, Habibi, Ismail I , and Rushani. The Bektashi Order, which is still active in Anatolia and the Balkans, was a repository for the Hurufi teachings and writings. One of Fazlallah's personal students, Raf√Æ'√Æ, emigrated into the Balkans. He transmitted a central thesis of Hurufism, that the cardinalities of the Arabic and Persian alphabet respectively enumerate all types of shape and sound, by axes of symmetry. A Hurufi rebellion in Kwarezem was suppressed by the Mongols, and that motivated the exodus of Hurufis to the Balkans. The Bektashi manuscripts show almost 500 years of Hurufism in the Balkans, with a peak in the 1700s. Other Sufi orders, such as the Qadiriyya and the Naqshbandi, contributed in the collection, retrieval, and translation of Hurufi manuscripts. =Hurufi manuscripts= From the Balkans, a great number of records were recorded in what is today Albania, but the relation between Bektashism and Hurufism is evidenced from Greek transcriptions. In total, many of the Hurufi manuscripts that are existent today were safeguarded in the libraries of Bektashi lodges, including Fadl‚ÄôAllah Yazd√¢n√Æ‚Äôs CƒÅvidƒÅn- NƒÅma,C√ÇVƒ∞D√ÇNN√ÇME, TDV ƒ∞sl√¢m Ansiklopedisi, v 7, pp. 173, 1993.FAZLULLAH-ƒ± HUR√õF√é, TDV ƒ∞sl√¢m Ansiklopedisi, v 12, pp. 277-279, 1995.

He is a member of the National Congress Party. Taha is a graduate of the Faculty of Law at the University of Khartoum. He then set up a private law practice before being appointed as a judge and then entering politics as a member of Sudan's parliament in the 1980s. Taha, along with John Garang, is credited as being the co-architect of Sudan's Comprehensive Peace Agreement which brought Africa's longest civil war to an end on 9 January 2005. The agreement capped an eight-year process to stop the civil war, which since 1983 had taken 2 million lives.‚ÄúSudan‚Äôs VP and rebel leader sign comprehensive peace agreement.‚Äù Sudan Tribune.

Taha heads the Sudanese side of the Sudanese-Egyptian High Committee, which was headed on the Egyptian side by Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif and includes Ministers from both countries and aims to foster cooperation between the two countries. Omar al-Bashir reappointed Taha as Second Vice President in May 2010 in spite of speculations that he would be replaced by a more hard-line NCP member or a Darfurian. Taha was viewed as a moderate figure in the NCP regime and a possible successor to Bashir, although some have suggested that Bashir might have preferred that his successor be a hard-liner.Ulf Laessing, \\"Analysis: Sudan's Bashir plays to hardliners to stem succession debate\\", Reuters, 3 July 2013.

They speak Dardic languages, which belong to the Indo-Aryan family of Indo-European languages. The largest populations of Dards are in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan and in the Kashmir Valley and Chenab Valley in India. There are smaller populations in Ladakh in India and in eastern Afghanistan. The Kashmiri people are the largest Dardic group, with a population of over 5.5 million. History Asko Parpola identifies \\"Proto-Dardic\\" with \\"Proto- Rigvedic\\", suggesting that the Dards are the linguistic descendants of the bearers of proto-Vedic culture ca. 1700 BC, pointing to features in certain Dardic dialects that continue peculiarities of Vedic Sanskrit, such as the gerund in -tvƒ´. According to Gerard Fussman, the word Dard is only used in the field of linguistics, not as a country or ethnicity. During Swati rule, the Dards predominantly followed a form of Hinduism. Religion The vast majority of Dardic peoples are Muslim. Kashmiris, Pashayis, Kohistanis, Brokpas and Kho are majority Sunni. The Shia are majority Ismaili and Twelver. Some in Gilgit-Baltistan follow Noorbakshia Islam. A significant minority of ethnic Kashmiris are Shaivite Hindus, known locally as Kashmiri Pandits. The Kalash people of Chitral follow a form of ancient Hinduism infused with local pagan/animist accretions. In the Ladakhi villages of Da and Hanoo, the majority of the population is Buddhist, although some follow animistic traditions.

He presented the idea in his book The Disappearing City in 1932. A few years later he unveiled a very detailed twelve by twelve foot (3.7 √ó 3.7 m) scale model representing a hypothetical four square mile (10 km¬≤) community. The model was crafted by the student interns who worked for him at Taliesin, and financed by Edgar Kaufmann. It was initially displayed at an Industrial Arts Exposition in the Forum at the Rockefeller Center starting on April 15, 1935. After the New York exposition, Kaufmann arranged to have the model displayed in Pittsburgh at an exposition titled \\"New Homes for Old\\", sponsored by the Federal Housing Administration. The exposition opened on June 18 on the 11th floor of Kaufmann's store. Wright went on to refine the concept in later books and in articles until his death in 1959. Many of the building models in the concept were completely new designs by Wright, while others were refinements of older ones, some of which had rarely been seen. Plan Broadacre City was the antithesis of a city and the apotheosis of the newly born suburbia, shaped through Wright's particular vision. It was both a planning statement and a socio-political scheme, inspired by Henry George, by which each U.S. family would be given a plot of land from the federal lands reserves, and a Wright-conceived community would be built anew from this.The Disappearing City, in Frank Lloyd Wright. Frank Lloyd Wright Collected Writings, volume 3: 1931-39. Edited by Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer, introduction by Kenneth Frampton (Rizzoli International Publications, Inc., New York City, 1993), 91: \\"In the City of Tomorrow ground space will be reckoned by the acre: an acre to the family.\\" In a sense it was the exact opposite of transit-oriented development. There is a train station and a few office and apartment buildings in Broadacre City, but the apartment dwellers are expected to be a small minority. All important transport is done by automobile and the pedestrian can exist safely only within the confines of the plots where most of the population dwells. In his book Urban Planning Theory since 1945, Nigel Taylor considers the planning methodology of this type of city to be Blueprint planning, which came under heavy criticism in the late 1950s by many critics such as Jane Jacobs, in her book The Death and Life of Great American Cities. Similar models Some of the earlier garden city ideas of the landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted and the urban planner Ebenezer Howard had much in common with Broadacre City, save for the absence of the automobile, born much later. More recently, the development of the edge city is like an unplanned, incomplete version of Broadacre city. The R. W. Lindholm Service Station in Cloquet, Minnesota, shows some of Wright's ideas for Broadacre City.

History  KCB Bank Kenya roots trace back to July 1896 when its parent company, KCB Group, was formed as a branch of the National Bank of India in Mombasa. In 1958, Grindlays Bank merged with the National Bank of India to form the National and Grindlays Bank. Upon independence, the Government of Kenya acquired 60% shareholding in National & Grindlays Bank. In 1970, the Government took full control of the bank and renamed it to Kenya Commercial Bank Group. KCB Bank Kenya, as it is now known, was incorporated in 2015 as a result of the corporate restructure of Kenya Commercial Bank Group (KCB Group). Prior to 2015, KCB Group was both a licensed bank and a holding company for its subsidiaries. This was in compliance with the Kenya Finance Act No.57 of 2012. KCB Group Limited announced, in April 2015, its intention to incorporate a new wholly owned subsidiary, KCB Bank Kenya Limited, to which it would transfer its Kenyan banking business, assets and liabilities. The re- organisation converted KCB Group Limited into a non-trading holding company that owns both banking and non-banking subsidiary companies. In 2016, KCB Group PLC was registered as a non-operating holding company to manage and oversee all KCB regional units in Kenya, Tanzania, South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Ethiopia.

Main) is a municipality in the Aschaffenburg district in the Regierungsbezirk of Lower Franconia (Unterfranken) in Bavaria, Germany. It is the westernmost settlement in Bavaria. Karlstein's Ortsteile (constituent villages) are Dettingen and Gro√üwelzheim, the former being notable as the site of the Battle of Dettingen during the War of the Austrian Succession. In the 20th century, the town was the site of the, now decommissioned, Gro√üwelzheim Nuclear Power Plant Geography =Location= Constituent communities Karlstein am Main lies on the River Main, and on the railway between Frankfurt am Main and Aschaffenburg, 16 km northwest of Aschaffenburg. =Constituent communities= Karlstein's Ortsteile are Dettingen and Gro√üwelzheim. History =Prehistory= The placename Dettingen suggests an Alamannic settlement (3rd to 14th century), and the placename Gro√üwelzheim a Frankish one. =First mentions= Gro√üwelzheim had its first documentary mention in a donation document from Lorsch Abbey in 772. Then, the village was called Walinesheim. The placename has the ‚Äîheim ending that was typical for places founded in Frankish times. The name comes from a count named Walah who held sway in the Maingau. Dettingen had its first documentary mention in a donation document from Emperor Otto II. =Battle of Dettingen= George II at the Battle of Dettingen During the War of the Austrian Succession a battle took place in the Karlstein area on 27 June 1743, known as the Battle of Dettingen. The so- called \\"Pragmatic Army\\", made up of 35,000 Britons, Hanoverians and Austrians found itself fighting a 70,000-strong French army. The Pragmatic Army overcame the French, thus giving rise to the legend of the \\"Wandering Englishman\\", which has been handed down in Dettingen to this day. The Battle of Dettingen marked the last time a British monarch, King George II, personally led his troops into battle. George Frideric Handel wrote the Dettingen Te Deum in honour of the British victory, which was first performed on 27 November 1743 ‚Äì exactly five months after the battle began ‚Äì in George II's presence. =Amalgamation= In the course of municipal reform in Bavaria came the merger of the two communities of Dettingen and Gro√üwelzheim on 1 July 1975. In a vote, the new community's citizens decided on the name Karlstein, which had cropped up as early as some time about 1000 in a description of the Aschaffenburg Forest Region, and was also the name given an old community limit stone between Dettingen and Gro√üwelzheim. =Etymology= The name Karlstein supposedly, according to a traditional anecdote, goes back to Charlemagne (who is called Karl der Gro√üe in German). Charlemagne reportedly often stayed in Seligenstadt, right across the river, and was much given to hunting in the Spessart. To reach there, he would cross the Main in his ship to the place then still known as Tettingen. The stone at the landing, or even the limit stone between Tettingen and Walinesheim, then came to be known as Karlstein. Politics =Community council= The council is made up of 20 council members, not counting the mayor. { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"60%\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"   CSU  SPD  GREENS  FDP  Total - align=\\"center\\"  2008  13  5  1  1  20 seats } (as at municipal election held on 2 March 2008) =Coat of arms= The community's arms might be described thus: Party per fess wavy, azure the Cross of Dettingen argent, argent an atom symbol with three orbits of the first and a nucleus gules. The wavy parting refers to the community's location on the Main, which is also part of the community's name. Since the community was formed out of the two former communities of Dettingen and Gro√üwelzheim in 1975, the arms display charges from each former community's arms. The uniquely shaped cross above the parting is the so-called Cross of Dettingen (or Dettinger Kreuz in German). It comes from Late Gothic times and is found in Saint Hippolytus's Church (Kirche St. Hippolyt) in the constituent community of Dettingen. The atom symbol below the parting is taken from the arms formerly borne by the community of Gro√üwelzheim. Within community limits, Germany's first nuclear power station was built, although it was only experimental. In 1960, it began feeding electricity into the power grid. The reactor was shut down in 1985, and by the end of 2008, it had been fully removed. The arms have been borne since 13 October 1977. Economy =Nuclear power stations= On 13 November 1960, the Kahl Nuclear Power Plant, which despite the name is wholly within Karlstein's limits, came into service. The neighbouring community of Kahl am Main merely stood godfather at the christening. On 25 November 1985, after running for 25 years, the power station was shut down. In 1988 the first dismantling work began, ending by late 2008. The Gro√üwelzheim hot steam reactor was in the same area; it was fully dismantled by 1998.

Overview The order forces the 'litterbugs' to clean up a specified location as ordered by the government, while wearing a bright green luminous vest bearing the words \\"Corrective Work Order\\". The punishment aims to force the offender to rehabilitate and shame litterbugs in public to deter others from committing the similar offence. It may also be meted out together with a fine. Results Corrective Work Order was intended for repeat offenders only. Introduced in 1992, it proved to be very successful. Littering offenses have significantly dropped, and there were very few repeat offenders. Occasionally, a few who served Corrective Work Order had their faces photographed by The Straits Times and published on the front cover. Litterbugs serving Corrective Work Order usually have their faces covered with a mask or plastic bag (which is legal) to avoid being identified by members of the public.

The film starred Doris Day as the title character and Howard Keel as Hickok. It was devised by Warner Bros. in response to the success of Annie Get Your Gun. It was nominated for Scoring of a Musical Picture and Best Sound, Recording (William A. Mueller). The songs and screenplay form the basis of a stage musical of the same name that has had a number of productions. Plot Calamity Jane (Doris Day) rides into Deadwood, Dakota Territory as shotgun messenger on the stagecoach. When boasting how hazardous the journey was through Indian Territory, the men laugh at her exaggerated account. Survivors of an Indian attack report that the man Calamity has set her sights on, US Cavalry Lt. Danny Gilmartin (Philip Carey), was killed. When Calamity presses the survivors on how Gilmartin was killed, they admit they do not really know if he is dead. Calamity enters a Sioux war party camp with her six shooters blazing and rescues Lt. Gilmartin. Meanwhile, the local saloon, the Golden Garter, sends for beautiful women entertainers to appear on stage in a predominately male town. The saloon owner is surprised when a woman entertainer he hired turns out to be a man named Francis Fryer (Dick Wesson). Fearing a riot, the owner persuades the reluctant Fryer to perform in drag. Initially convincing, his wig falls off, revealing him is a man. The angry audience begin storming out. Calamity calms the situation by vowing to bring the one woman all the men are fawning over: singer Adelaid Adams (Gale Robbins), who is in Chicago. Francis Fryer tells Calamity that Adams would never agree to come to Deadwood but Calamity is determined. Wild Bill Hickok (Howard Keel) scoffs at Calamity's idea. Calamity travels to Chicago where Adams is giving her farewell performance before launching a European tour. Adelaid gives her old costumes to her maid, Katie Brown (Allyn McLerie), who dreams of becoming a singer. When Calamity walks in, she mistakes Katie for Adelaid. Katie, posing as Adelaid Adams, agrees to go with Calamity, seeing it as a chance to perform on stage. During Katie's first performance at the Golden Garter, Calamity realizes she sounds different. Katie bursts into tears and admits that she is not Adelaid Adams, stunning the crowd who are then on verge of rioting. Calamity fires a shot into the air and defends Katie. The audience allows Katie to carry on, and her performance wins them over. Calamity and Katie become friends; Katie moves into Calamity's ramshackle cabin which they fix up together. To attract Lt. Gilmartin, Calamity, with Katie's help, dresses and acts more ladylike. Lt. Gilmartin and Wild Bill Hickok, who are both in love with Katie, pay a visit to Calamity's cabin. While alone with Lt. Gilmartin, Katie knows he prefers her, but tells him that Calamity loves him and she will not betray her friend. Lt. Gilmartin tells Katie that he is not interested in Calamity. Katie tells both men that Calamity has changed, which they will see when she returns to the cabin. While waiting, the two men draw straws to see who will take Katie to the upcoming ball. Lt. Gilmartin wins, and Wild Bill agrees to take Calamity, though she believes Lt. Gilmartin prefers her. Before the men can see Calamity's transformation, she arrives back at the cabin covered in mud, having slipped while crossing the creek. At the ball, everyone is amazed by Calamity's transformation. She becomes increasingly jealous watching Katie and Danny dancing together. Outside in the garden, Katie can no longer resist Lt. Gilmartin, and they kiss. Calamity, seeing them, reacts angrily and confronts Katie, shooting a punch glass from her hand. Back at her cabin, Calamity throws out Katie's belongings, vowing to shoot her if she ever sees her again, then breaks down in tears. Calamity later confronts Katie during her performance, and warns her to leave town. Katie is not frightened and borrows a gun, telling Calamity to hold up a shot glass. Taunting her, Calamity boldly holds it up. A gunshot rings out, and the glass falls from Calamity's hand. It was actually Wild Bill who secretly took the shot, but he lets everyone think it was Katie. Humiliated, Calamity storms out, but Wild Bill grabs her, throws her into his wagon and drives off. Calamity Jane (Doris Day) and Wild Bill Hickok (Howard Keel) at the Golden Garter Wild Bill tries calming Calamity, and reveals that he shot the glass from her hand to teach her a lesson. He says that scaring Katie to leave town would not stop Lt. Gilmartin from loving her. Calamity is heartbroken, and reveals she was crazy about Gilmartin, while Wild Bill admits that he loved Katie. Calamity says there will never be another man for her, but she and Wild Bill passionately embrace and kiss. Calamity realizes she loved Wild Bill all along. The sun rises on a new day as a much happier Calamity rides into town, but the townsfolk rebuff her. Katie has decided to return to Chicago, feeling guilty over betraying her best friend. Lt. Gilmartin is furious with Calamity for driving Katie away and gives her Katie's note. Calamity chases after the stagecoach, eventually catching up. She tells Katie she loves Wild Bill, and the two women are friends again. A double wedding follows and the two happy couples leave town on the stagecoach.For music, lyrics and libretto of subsequent stage play and musical adapted after the Warner Bros Film, also see: Vocal score- \\"Calamity Jane (Operetta in Two Acts)\\" Amateur Operatic Version Warner Chappell Music Ltd copyright 2006 by Faber Music Ltd ().

Film critic Jamie Stuart points to the film's lesbian overtones in Jane being played as a strong, independent woman who shares a house with a woman, the two of them painting \\"Calam and Katie\\" in a heart on its door. Armond White sees the film as approaching sexuality in a way that Hollywood was not openly able to do, describing the empathy and envy (despite this resulting from conflict over a man) between Jane and Katie's characters as \\"a landmark display of girl-on-girl attraction.\\" Out magazine described the film's award-winning song, \\"Secret Love,\\" as \\"the first gay anthem.\\" Accuracy Though the film portrays Calamity Jane and Wild Bill Hickok as lovers, historians have found no proof that they were more than acquaintances. Jane claimed after Hickok's death that she had not only been his lover but also his wife and the mother of his child, but she offered no substantiation of her claims. Many of her contemporaries considered her a teller of tall tales (as portrayed in the film to humorous effect) who exaggerated her links to more famous frontier figures, and some insisted Hickok did not even particularly like her. But when she died decades after Hickok, friends buried her beside him at her request; four of the men on the self-appointed committee who planned Calamity's funeral (Albert Malter, Frank Ankeney, Jim Carson, and Anson Higby) later stated that, since Hickok had \\"absolutely no use\\" for Jane in this life, they decided to play a posthumous joke on him by laying her to rest by his side.Griske, Michael (2005).

The Kasba Ganapati is the presiding deity (gramadevata) of Pune. History The temple was commissioned by Jijausaheb, after Dadoji Konddeo reported to her that an idol of Ganpati had been found in Pune. The idol's status as the premier idol in Pune was decided by Bal Gangadhar Tilak. In the year 1630, the Maratha Aristocrat and wife of Sardar Shahaji Bhosale, Jijaubaisaheb Bhosale arrived in Pune with her then infant son, Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj, the founder of Maratha Empire. Around this time, along with other seven families, the Thakar Family migrated to Pune from the village of Indi, Bijapur district in present day state of Karnataka. Shri Vinayak Bhatt Thakar also carried his Family deity, Lord Gajanan along with him. All these families settled near River bank around the current place of Kasba Ganapati Temple which was close to the residence of Jijabai. Jijabai perceived this as an auspicious moment and promptly decided to build a temple, which is popularly known as the Kasba Ganpati Mandir. Since then, Pune is also known as the city of Ganesh. The Peshwas were ardent followers of Lord Ganesh. During their regime Shaniwarwada witnessed grand celebrations for Lord Ganesh. In 1893, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, the Indian Nationalist Leader, initiated the now famous Ganesh Festival. His intention was to gather people sharing similar ideas and exchange thoughts to deal with the British ruler. He started celebrating Ganesh Festival from his own house called Kesari Wada. Due to his personal popularity and initiative, Ganesh Festival became a public festival soon afterwards. There was rivalry among the various mandals regarding the privilege of immersing the idol on the last day of the Ganpati festival. Bal Gangadhar Tilak resolved the rivalry and declared the privilege of immersion to Shri Kasba Ganpati, as it is the local deity of Pune. Annual Ganesh Festival Until 1925, Shri Kasba Ganpati Mandal celebrated the festival within the premises of the temple and from 1926 it has been celebrated in an enclosed mandap. Presently, the ten days of the festival is a platform for local artists to display their talents through various cultural programs thus allowing a large number of devotees to participate in the celebrations. On the last day, Shri Kasba Ganpati plays the leading role during the immersion procession.

Koray has been in the Turkish rock music scene since the late 1950s. He is widely acclaimed as being the first person to ever play rock and roll in Turkey; in 1957, he and his band gained fame by playing covers of Elvis Presley and Fats Domino. He was also one of the first Turkish musicians to embrace the electric guitar and modern amplification. In addition to his own compositions, he rearranged multiple well known Turkish folk songs. By combining Western and Eastern musical styles, Koray pioneered in the development of Turkish rock music genre and Anatolian rock sound. By the late 1960s, he had become a major figure in Turkish psychedelic music and Anatolian rock, beginning with his first psychedelic single Anma Arkada≈ü in 1967. Koray followed this with a number of singles, both by himself and in collaboration with others, that established him as a force to be reckoned with on the Turkish rock scene. In the early 1970s, he formed the group Ter with the former members of the band Bunalƒ±m (\\"Group Depression\\"). Although they only recorded one single before breaking up, Hor G√∂rme Garibi (a cover of the major Arabesque music hit by Orhan Gencebay) was a smash hit, furthering Koray's career. Ter was influenced by fuzz rock and psychedelia and featured extended guitar solos and progressive arrangements ‚Äì something that the record company was not prepared to accept. In 1973, his first album, Erkin Koray, was released, consisting of a collection of singles from 1967 to 1973. He left Istanbul Records after the release of the album. In 1974, he signed with Doglan Records and released ≈ûa≈ükƒ±n (Dabke). 1974 also saw the release of his groundbreaking album, Elektronik T√ºrk√ºler (\\"Electronic Ballads\\"). Finally given the freedom to record an album instead of being limited to 45 rpm singles, Koray and his band created an album that reflected both his Turkish roots and his love of psychedelic and progressive rock. The album's popularity continues to the present day, with several legitimate and non-legitimate releases on both album and CD. Now Koray lives in Vancouver Canada and continues to create new songs to this day, and in Turkish music circles he is often referred to as Erkin Baba (\\"Erkin the Father\\") for his pioneering influence on Turkish popular music. Other major hits by Koray are Fesuphanallah, Istemem, Sevince, √ñyle Bir Ge√ßer Zaman ki , Estarabim, Arap Sa√ßƒ±, Yalnƒ±zlar Rƒ±htƒ±mƒ±, Akrebin G√∂zleri and √á√∂p√ß√ºler. In the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade), a flowering of interest in psychedelic music made outside of the UK and the US brought Koray to the attention of listeners in the West. Koray is also the inventor of the electric baƒülama, a traditional Turkish musical instrument related to the lute, and its unique sound can be heard on many of his albums.

Binary exponential backoff algorithm In a variety of computer networks, binary exponential backoff or truncated binary exponential backoff refers to an algorithm used to space out repeated retransmissions of the same block of data, often to avoid network congestion. Examples are the retransmission of frames in carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) and carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) networks, where this algorithm is part of the channel access method used to send data on these networks. In Ethernet networks, the algorithm is commonly used to schedule retransmissions after collisions. The retransmission is delayed by an amount of time derived from the slot time (for example, the time it takes to send 512 bits; i.e., 512 bit-times) and the number of attempts to retransmit. After c collisions, a random number of slot times between 0 and is chosen. After the first collision, each sender will wait 0 or 1 slot times. After the second collision, the senders will wait anywhere from 0 to 3 slot times (inclusive). After the third collision, the senders will wait anywhere from 0 to 7 slot times (inclusive), and so forth. As the number of retransmission attempts increases, the number of possibilities for delay increases exponentially. The 'truncated' simply means that after a certain number of increases, the exponentiation stops; i.e. the retransmission timeout reaches a ceiling, and thereafter does not increase any further. For example, if the ceiling is set at (as it is in the IEEE 802.3 CSMA/CD standard (purchase)), then the maximum delay is 1023 slot times. This is useful because these delays cause other stations that are sending to collide as well. There is a possibility that, on a busy network, hundreds of people may be caught in a single collision set.Computer Networks, 5th Edition, p. 303, Tanenbaum Example exponential backoff algorithm This example is from the Ethernet protocol,Computer Networks, Peterson and Davie where a sending host is able to know when a collision has occurred (that is, another host has tried to transmit), when it is sending a frame. If both hosts attempted to re-transmit as soon as a collision occurred, there would be yet another collision -- and the pattern would continue forever. The hosts must choose a random value within an acceptable range to ensure that this situation doesn't happen. An exponential backoff algorithm is therefore used. The value '51.2 Œºs' is used as an example here because it is the slot time for a 10 Mbit/s Ethernet line (see Slot time). However, 51.2 Œºs could be replaced by any positive value, in practice. # When a collision first occurs, send a \\"Jamming signal\\" to prevent further data from being sent. # Resend a frame after either 0 seconds or 51.2 Œºs, chosen at random. # If that fails, resend the frame after either 0 s, 51.2 Œºs, 102.4 Œºs, or 153.6 Œºs. # If that still doesn't work, resend the frame after k ¬∑ 51.2 Œºs, where k is a random integer between 0 and 23 ‚àí 1\\\\. # In general, after the cth failed attempt, resend the frame after k ¬∑ 51.2 Œºs, where k is a random integer between 0 and 2c ‚àí 1\\\\. Expected backoff Given a uniform distribution of backoff times, the expected backoff time is the mean of the possibilities. That is, after c collisions, the number of backoff slots is in , where and the expected backoff time (in slots) is :\\\\frac{1}{N+1}\\\\sum_{i=0}^{N} i . For example, the expected backoff time for the third () collision, one could first calculate the maximum backoff time, N: :N = 2^c - 1 :N = 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 :N = 7 , and then calculate the mean of the backoff time possibilities: :\\\\operatorname{E}(c) = \\\\frac{1}{N+1}\\\\sum_{i=0}^{N} i = \\\\frac{1}{N+1}\\\\frac{N(N+1)}{2} = \\\\frac{N}{2} = \\\\frac{2^c-1}{2}. which is, for the example, E(3) = 3.5 slots.

A leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), he served as the President of Bangladesh from 1981 to 1982, and earlier as the vice president of Bangladesh. A jurist by profession, Sattar held numerous constitutional and political offices in British Bengal, East Pakistan and Bangladesh. He was a cabinet minister, supreme court judge, and chief election commissioner. Sattar was one of the few executive presidents in the country's history. Beset by health problems and old age, his short lived presidency was marked by growing political turmoil and interference from the military. Sattar was overthrown in the 1982 Bangladesh coup d'√©tat. Early life and career Sattar was born in 1906 in Birbhum in the then Bengal Presidency, British India. He obtained his LLB and Master of Law from the University of Calcutta and joined the Calcutta High Court Bar. He became a protege of A. K. Fazlul Huq, the first Prime Minister of Bengal. He served in various municipal bodies in Calcutta as an activist for the Krishak Praja Party. In 1950, following the Partition of British India, Sattar moved to Dacca in the Dominion of Pakistan. He joined the Dhaka High Court Bar. He was elected to the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan in 1955. He served as the Home Minister of Pakistan and Education Minister of Pakistan in the cabinet of Prime Minister Ibrahim Ismail Chundrigar in 1957. He was appointed as a Justice in the Dhaka High Court, which he served between 1957 and 1968. He also presided over cases in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. In 1969, Sattar was appointed as the Chief Election Commissioner of Pakistan. He organised the first general election of Pakistan in 1970, in which the Awami League gained a historic parliamentary majority to form government. The League was denied the handover of power by the then military junta led by General Yahya Khan. As the Bangladesh Liberation War erupted with a genocide against Bengali civilians, Sattar was stranded in Islamabad, West Pakistan, removed from official positions and interned by the Pakistani government. In 1973, Sattar returned to independent Bangladesh as part of the repatriation of stranded Bengali officials. He enjoyed rising prominence in Dhaka, but lived a quiet life with his wife and had no children. Sattar served as chairman of the board of Directors in the Bangladesh Life Insurance Corporation (1973‚Äì1974), Chairman of the Journalist Wage Board (1974‚Äì1975) and Chairman of the Bangladesh Institute of Law and International Affairs. In 1975, he was appointed as an adviser to President Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem and vested in charge of the Ministry of Law and Parliamentary Affairs. In 1977, the new president and Chief Martial Law Administrator, Lt General Ziaur Rahman, appointed Sattar as Vice President of Bangladesh. With the reinstatement of multiparty politics, Sattar joined the newly formed Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in 1978. Speaking of Zia, Sattar said \\"he was like my son. I loved him too much. I loved him because he was trying to build this small country in a better way.\\" Presidency Sattar (seated third on left) with world leaders at the North-South Summit in Cancun, Mexico, 1981 When Zia was assassinated in May 1981, a frail Vice-President Sattar was in hospital and automatically became the acting president of Bangladesh. Speaking to foreign reporters in Bangabhaban on 4 June, he announced that elections within 180 days of the death of the former president were on schedule as per the constitution, to \\"foil any conspiracy to disturb the democratic process in the country.\\" A state of emergency was imposed. The election date of 21 September was pushed back to 15 November, as opposition parties demanded more time to campaign. Violence occurred when 12 army officers were executed after being convicted of complicity in Zia's killing. As the nominee of BNP, Sattar won the presidential election in 1981, beating with a big margin his principal challenger Kamal Hossain from the Bangladesh Awami League. Hossain and other opposition groups alleged the polls were rigged. The emergency was lifted after the election. Sattar appointed a 42-member Council of Ministers. He let Zia's controversial prime minister Shah Azizur Rahman continue in the top job. Sattar personally held the Defence and Planning portfolios. He appointed economist Mirza Nurul Huda as the vice president. Violence against Bengali Muslims in Assam in neighbouring India flared during Sattar's presidency. Sattar formed a National Security Council to explore how the Bangladesh Armed Forces could contribute to the nation's development. He was elected unopposed as President of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party in January 1982. Sattar then formed a new cabinet. Vice- President Huda resigned on 21 March 1982, claiming that he was the victim of a conspiracy within BNP. Sattar appointed Mohammad Mohammadullah as Huda's replacement. =1982 military coup= A bloodless coup-d'etat led by the Bangladesh Army chief Hussain Muhammad Ershad toppled Sattar's government in 1982. On the morning of 24 March, the heads of the Bangladesh Navy, the Bangladesh Air Force, the Bangladesh Rifles and the military secretary to the president entered Bangabhaban and forced Sattar to sign a statement relinquishing power. Martial law was declared. Sattar was replaced by the retired justice A. F. M. Ahsanuddin Chowdhury. Death Sattar died at the Suhrawardy Hospital in Dhaka on 5 October 1985, at the age of 79.

In 1901, the Norwegian Conrad Evensen bought the old whaling boat Emma from a company in the Finnmark, and founded the whaling station in Funningsfj√∏r√∞ur, also with the name Emma. The first year the station produced 1160 barrels of whale oil. The company only had one boat from 1901 to 1909, though in 1905 Emma was whaling from a station in Iceland. In 1909 the company bought a new whaling boat called Funding, named after the village Funningur which had lent its name to the fjord which in turn lent its name to the village. 1909 was the best year for whaling in Faroese whaling history, with 13,850 barrels of whale oil produced in total. In 1912 the station expanded with a bone meal factory, and this increased earnings somewhat, especially because Emma was the only company who whaled \\"nor√∞anfj√∏r√∞s\\" ‚Äì north of the Skopunarfjord ‚Äì in 1913 and 1915, meaning north of Su√∞uroy and Sandoy. 1915 was the best year for Emma, with 3000 barrels of whale oil, and 3000 200lb bags of bone meal. The onset of World War I, however meant that there was never activity at the station again. In 1956, one of the boiler tanks from the station was taken down and used as filler for the construction of the wharf in the village, which was being built at the time. On September 15th, 2018, the last substantial remnant of the whaling station (the remains of a boiler) was disposed of, as part of an international environmental clean-up event.

Early years By the age of six, Calogero had already taken an interest in music. He quickly learned to play several instruments, including the flute, piano, and bass As part of Les Charts In 1986 he became the lead singer and songwriter for a band called Les Charts he started with his brother, Gioacchino Maurici, and a childhood friend, Francis Maggiulli. Between 1989 and 1997, Les Charts released five albums, L'Oc√©an sans fond (1989), Notre monde √† nous (1991), Hannibal (1994), Acte 1 (1995) their most successful charting album and Changer (1997). After break-up, all members of Les Charts continued with solo musical careers, but continued to co-write songs together, first, under the name of Calogero Bros. and later listing of their individual names. Solo career As the band began to lose its momentum, Calogero decided to launch himself as a solo artist and gathered important connections by writing songs and collaborating with already popular artists such as Zazie and Pascal Obispo. The latter helped produce Calogero's first solo album Au milieu des Autres (2000). His second album, Calogero (2002) was a huge success with the hit singles \\"En apesanteur\\" (In Weightlessness), \\"Aussi libre que moi\\" (As Free as Me), \\"Tien an men\\" and \\"Prendre racine\\" (To Take Root). Finally, in 2004, Calogero released 3, featuring \\"Face √† la mer\\" a duet with French rapper Passi and several other top singles such as \\"Yalla\\" and \\"Si seulement je pouvais lui manquer\\". Calogero's moving lyrics and frail, tender voice have made him one of France's top pop/rock singers. Calogero released his fourth studio album Pomme C on 12 March 2007. Collaborations as composer Since the late 1990s, Calogero composed songs for many artists, often in collaboration with his brother Gioacchino. For example, he composed songs for Florent Pagny (\\"Ch√¢telet-les-Halles\\"), H√©l√®ne S√©gara (\\"Au Nom d'une Femme\\" and \\"Regarde\\"), Ismael Lo (\\"L'Amour a tous les droits\\" and \\"Faut qu'on s'aime\\"), Pascal Obispo (\\"Mill√©sime\\"), Jenifer Bartoli (\\"C'est de l'or\\"), Julie Zenatti (\\"La V√©rit√© m'attire\\" et \\"Toutes les douleurs\\"), Patrick Fiori (\\"Que tu reviennes\\", \\"√ätre l√†\\", \\"Encore\\", \\"Tout le monde\\", \\"Tera umana\\" et \\"Il n'y a pas grand chose √† dire\\"), Fred Blondin (\\"Je manque de toi\\" and \\"Perso et les Aimants\\"), Mario Barravecchia (\\"On se ressemble\\"). He also composed three songs for the musical The Ten Commandments: \\"Je n'avais jamais pri√©\\", \\"Une Raison d'esp√©rer\\" and \\"Y'a tant d'amour\\". Calogero also participates in numerous charities. He is currently member of Les Enfoir√©s, he also participated in the single \\"No√´l ensemble\\" recorded by many artists in 2002, he sang for the Sidaction with Jenifer, and recently, he participated in the single \\"Douce France\\" led by Marc Lavoine to fight discrimination and help young people to have work. In 2008, Stanislas Renoult recorded a duet with Calogero entitled \\"La D√©b√¢cle des sentiments\\". Musical style Calogero describes his own musical style as \\"pop rock\\". He also said that he listens musical work of various artists such as Barbara, William Sheller, The Cure and The Who and that \\"words and melodies are very important to [him]\\". He has a great admiration for the Beatles, especially for Paul McCartney whose song \\"Live and Let Die\\" is covered on Live 1.0. Calogero said about McCartney, \\"Paul McCartney? A myth [legend]! For all bassists he is Uncle Paul\\". Between his first solo album and his last tour, the musical style evolved significantly to a more percussive rock, and he also said that his fourth album, Pomme C, had the closest sound to him. Calogero is a bass player but he also plays keyboards and guitar. His initial musical training was on the organ. On his first solo album, he plays the guitar, while on the next two he plays bass. He is left handed and sings about this in the song \\"Conduire en Angleterre\\". In Circus Starting 2012, the French band Circus was established that included Calogero as well as Stanislas, Philippe Uminski, Elsa Fourlon and Karen Brunon, all already established artists. Their debut self-titled album Circus was released in 2012.

It measures this size not in units of currency, but in average sales days. Typically, days sales outstanding is calculated monthly. Generally speaking, higher DSO ratio can indicate a customer base with credit problems and/or a company that is deficient in its collections activity. A low ratio may indicate the firm's credit policy is too rigorous, which may be hampering sales. Days sales outstanding is often misinterpreted as \\"the average number of days to fully collect payment after making a sale\\". The formula for this would be Œ£([Sales Date] - [Paid Date]) / ([Sale Count]). This calculation is sometimes called \\"True DSO\\". Instead, days sales outstanding is better interpreted as the \\"days worth of (average) sales that you currently have outstanding\\". Accordingly, days sales outstanding can be expressed as the following financial ratio: :DSO ratio = accounts receivable / average sales per day, or :DSO ratio = accounts receivable / (annual sales / 365 days) Accounts receivable refers to the outstanding balance of accounts receivable at a point in time here whereas average sales per day is the mean sales computed over some period of time. This can be annual as in the formula above, or it can be any period of time considered useful to the company. Because this is an average general KPI, though, choosing a time period that's too low may introduce undesirable artifacts in the data. Typically this is a calendar year or month or a fiscal year or period. Changes in \\"the average number of days to fully collect payment after making a sale\\" could impact days sales outstanding in that fluctuations in the length of the average collection effort could affect a company's accounts receivable balance, but days sales outstanding is also affected by fluctuations in sales volume. Days sales outstanding is considered an important tool in measuring liquidity. In some sense it measures the balance between a company's sales efforts and collection efforts. If sales decreases in isolation DSO will increase indicating that may run into cash flow problems in future when the sales dip flows through the collection cycle. If sales decreases proportionally to accounts receivable, DSO will not increase. While this may not be welcome news, it does not indicate a change in the balance of sales and receivables, and therefore will not affect DSO. Similarly, taking longer to collect will negatively affect DSO if sales remain the same (since the balance of receivables will increase), but if it's accompanied by a proportional increase in sales it does not change the balance of sales to receivables and so does not affect DSO. Days sales outstanding tends to increase as a company becomes less risk averse. Higher days sales outstanding can also be an indication of inadequate analysis of applicants for open account credit terms. An increase in DSO can result in cash flow problems, and may result in a decision to increase the creditor company's bad debt reserve. Days sales outstanding can vary from month to month, and over the course of a year with a company's seasonal business cycle. Of interest when analyzing the performance of a company is the trend in DSO. If DSO is getting longer, accounts receivable is increasing or average sales per day are decreasing. An increase in accounts receivable could indicate that customers are taking longer to pay their bills, which may be a warning that customers are dissatisfied with the company's product or service, or that sales are being made to customers that are less credit-worthy, or that salespeople have to offer longer payment terms in order to generate sales. Similarly, a decrease in average sales per day could indicate the need for more sales staff or better utilization. Some companies may attempt to focus in more on the collection aspect of DSO equation by calculating days delinquent sales outstanding (DDSO). This is simply (delinquent accounts receivable) / average sales per day. Because accounts receivable = current + delinquent accounts receivable, the DDSO formula is often defined as (accounts receivable / average sales per day) - (current accounts receivable / average sales per day). While mathematically more complex, it is the same number. This formula can be interpreted as DSO - \\"Best Possible\\" DSO, though. In this case it's the \\"Best Possible\\" because it's not assumed that, on average, you can expect your invoices to be paid before the due date. In this interpretation DDSO can be interpreted as the portion of DSO owing to over due receivables. Similar to DSO, though, DDSO can be affected by the speed of collecting overdue invoices but it does not measure speed. It measures size in units of average daily sales.

His name was Gr√≠mur Kamban, a Norwegian Viking escaping the tyranny of the Norse king Haraldur H√°rfagri. However, this is an error in this saga, because Harald's age was in the late 9th century, while the first Norse settlers reached the Faroes after 825. (Actually, Irish monks arrived much earlier ca. 625‚Äì650). Population About 70 people live in Funningur on both sides of a cascading stream in a compact cluster of houses around a small bay.

The G√°sadalstunnilin tunnel, Oct 2005 G√°sadalur is located on the edge of Mykinesfj√∏r√∞ur, surrounded by the highest mountains on V√°gar. √Årnafjall towers to a height of 722 metres to the north, and Eysturtindur to the east is 715 metres high. Here too, the view south to Tindh√≥lmur and G√°sh√≥lmur is quite magnificent. Eysturtindur translates to English as \\"the Peak in the East\\". The boat landing site is very poor, because it is located somewhat higher than the seashore. So if the residents wanted to fish, they were obliged to keep their boats near B√∏ur. In 1940, during the British occupation of the Faroe Islands, a stairway was built from the beach up to the village. In order to reach any of the other villages by land, residents had to take the strenuous route over mountains more than 400 metres high. This isolation explains why the village population had decreased. In 2002 there were only sixteen people living in G√°sadalur, and several of the houses stand empty today. It had a population of 18 in 2012.F√≥lkatal - Municipality website In 2004 the G√°sadalstunnilin tunnel was blasted through the rock, and it became possible to drive through by car. The residents hope this will mean that the village population will increase again. There are good opportunities for farming, and the same number of fields as in B√∏ur, but here only a few are royal estate, while most of them are freehold land. Etymology There is a story that the village was named after a woman called G√¶sa, who came from Kirkjub√∏ur. She had eaten meat during the Lent fast, and for this unholy deed all her property was confiscated. She fled to the valley on V√°gar, which was named after her. Most other village stories are about spirits and elves. A more likely explanation is that G√°sadalur (Goose Valley) is named after the wild geese, which from ancient times have traveled to the valley.

After longtime drummer and lead vocalist Phil Collins left the group in 1996, the remaining members ‚Äî founding keyboardist Tony Banks and guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford ‚Äî decided to continue and write new music for an album. After an auditioning process throughout 1996, they chose Scottish singer Ray Wilson as Genesis's new lead singer. Calling All Stations was released to mostly negative reviews from music critics who chastised its lack of direction, but praised Wilson's performance. It sold poorly in comparison to their earlier albums; it reached No. 2 in the UK and performed well in Europe, but it peaked at No. 54 in the US.[ Calling All Stations USA chart history], Billboard.com. Retrieved 9 November 2011. This marked their first not to crack the top 50 there since 1973. \\"Congo\\", the first of three singles from the album, went to No. 29 in the UK.Genesis UK chart history, The Official Charts. Retrieved 14 November 2017. Genesis toured Europe in 1998 for the Calling All Stations Tour, but cancelled their planned US tour due to low ticket sales. The group disbanded at the European tour's conclusion; Collins later returned to Genesis for the Turn It On Again Tour in 2006 and the upcoming The Last Domino? Tour in 2021. Background After an auditioning process, Scottish singer Ray Wilson replaced Phil Collins on lead vocals At the end of the We Can't Dance Tour in November 1992 the band went on hiatus, reuniting only for a one-off charity performance in September 1993. Their drummer and lead vocalist Phil Collins resumed his solo career and released Both Sides, keyboardist Tony Banks recorded an album with Jack Hues under the Strictly Inc. project, and guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford continued his band Mike + the Mechanics. In mid-1994, Collins said that singing Genesis songs at the charity gig after making Both Sides, which he deemed a highly personal album, was uncomfortable. \\"For the first time I felt like an actor playing somebody else's part.\\"https://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/news-pc-phil-ponders-life-without- genesis-tallahassee-democrat-29th-july/ After a band meeting with manager Tony Smith in the summer of 1995, Collins left. A press release from management announcing the news was released in March 1996. Banks and Rutherford decided they had nothing to lose and started to write new songs in January 1996 to see if it was worth carrying on with Genesis. After some ideas had been put down they were pleased with the results and began to audition lead singers. At this stage, the basic structure of the tracks on Calling All Stations had been written but the lyrics had not been worked on. Shortly after the album's release, Wilson compared the material as a mixture of their earlier progressive rock sound and their later, more commercial period.http://www.twronline.net/issues/twr36/twr36_chidd.htm The two strongest candidates were English singer David Longdon, now of Big Big Train, and Scottish singer and guitarist Ray Wilson of the grunge-influenced band Stiltskin. Longdon's song \\"Hieroglyphics of Love\\" attracted producer Nick Davis who forwarded it onto Banks and Rutherford and liked it enough to invite him to the studio to audition. Banks had liked Wilson's vocals from listening to Stiltskin's first album, The Mind's Eye (1994). For his first audition, Wilson sang Genesis songs with Collins's vocals removed. At his second, he was asked to contribute vocal ideas to the new music that Banks and Rutherford had written, singing and humming ideas on the spot. Takes from this session were used by Banks to shape the verses to \\"There Must Be Some Other Way\\". In November 1996, Banks and Rutherford chose Wilson as the new lead singer. Longdon said Rutherford phoned him with the news while Banks sent him a Christmas card with \\"a lengthy message inside.\\" The addition of Wilson to the band was not made public until 6 June 1997. Recording Calling All Stations features Israeli session drummer Nir Zidkyahu and American drummer Nick D'Virgilio of the prog rock band Spock's Beard. It was recorded using RADAR, a type of non-linear digital audio recording software capable of simultaneously recording 24-tracks onto computer hard drives. Wilson said he had a \\"pretty small\\" amount of input into the album. Wilson recalled having free rein with his vocals on Rutherford's songs because he \\"doesn't know what he wants until he hears it\\", whereas Banks had worked out firm ideas from the beginning. Songs \\"Calling All Stations\\" is the first track Banks and Rutherford wrote for the album and most of the original takes were retained for the recorded version. It was used as the opener because of its heavier rock sound and dramatic mood. The song's arrangement underwent several changes as Banks and Rutherford had Wilson sing various melody lines to see what his voice was capable of, resulting in a stronger track overall. Wilson picked \\"Calling All Stations\\" as his favourite song from the album. The lyrics to \\"Small Talk\\" were written by Wilson. The B-side \\"Anything Now\\" was considered one of the strongest tracks from the recording sessions but was not included on the album, as Banks believed \\"we couldn't quite get Ray to sing it right.\\" Release The album was launched in Europe on 26 August 1997 with a live press conference, interview, and acoustic performance on German television and VH1 from the Television Tower in Berlin. Two days later, the North American launch event with a live interview and acoustic performance took place at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, broadcast as a nationwide radio special. Calling All Stations peaked at No. 2 in the UK, making it the first Genesis studio album not to reach the top spot since ...And Then There Were Three... (1978). It was also their first album not to produce a Top 20 single in the UK since Wind & Wuthering (1976). It failed to make an impact in the US chart with a peak at No. 54 on the Billboard 200. This made Calling All Stations the first Genesis album since Selling England by the Pound (1973) to not crack its top 50. It also became their first album since A Trick of the Tail (1976) to not produce a charting single in the US. A Super Audio CD/DVD set with new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes was released in September 2007. A CD/DVD set was released in North America in November 2007. Reception Steve Knopper reviewed the album in the Chicago Tribune, calling it \\"a formless blob of synth sounds\\" and asserting that new singer Ray Wilson has \\"no confidence or personality, let alone the vision to stave off his bandmates' meandering ideas.\\" Both AllMusic and Rolling Stone commented that Ray Wilson was a fitting vocal replacement for Collins, but thought that the album was generally lacking in good material. AllMusic picked \\"Calling All Stations\\", \\"Congo\\", and \\"Not About Us\\" as the album's stronger tracks, while Rolling Stone described \\"Shipwrecked\\" and \\"Not About Us\\" as \\"pleasant if generic FM- rock tunes.\\" Both also commented on the album's odd mix of art rock and pop, believing that it failed to capture any of the likeable elements of either genre; Rolling Stone summarised it as \\"a Mike and the Mechanics artrock album\\". In 2014, Stevie Chick of The Guardian dismissed the album as \\"inexplicable\\". In a 2019 interview, Tony Banks thought the album contained \\"some very good songs,\\" but \\"has a kind of uniformity about it that I regret. It contains one or two rather weak tracks, too. We also left off two of the strongest tracks, which was a mistake.\\"https://www.innerviews.org/inner/tony- banks Rutherford said he did not regret the album, but due to its sales being lower than that of previous albums, he had \\"sensed that the mood had changed in terms of radio play.\\" As he thought Genesis was \\"becoming a catalogue act,\\" this influenced the band's decision to not continue after the album. Tour and aftermath Genesis supported the album with a 47-date European tour from 29 January to 31 May 1998, featuring shows in large arenas throughout Europe. The core trio were joined by Zidkyahu on drums, percussion, and backing vocals and Irish musician Anthony Drennan on guitar and bass. Rehearsals took place at Bray Film Studios in Windsor and the Working Men's Club in Chiddingfold, close the band's recording studio. The tour concluded with spots at the Rock am Ring and Rock im Park Festival in Germany. A majority of the older songs were transposed in a lower key to accommodate Wilson's lower vocal range. Midway through the set included an acoustic medley of songs from their 1970s output. The tour was captured live on the promotional album Calling Radio Stations. A 27-date North American tour in large arenas was booked to start in November 1997 but it was cancelled due to insufficient ticket sales, along with a revised 22-date schedule in smaller venues. At the European tour's conclusion, Genesis went on hiatus; Wilson was later informed by Banks and Rutherford that the band would not be continuing. It would be the band's last full-length tour until Collins returned for the 2007 Turn It On Again reunion tour. the band went on another disbandment again shortly after the conclusion of that tour (in 2008). Collins, Banks, Rutherford, along with Collins's son Nic, and former Genesis member Anthony Phillips later regrouped as Genesis and announced a official proper reunion in 2020, with the band currently set to start their latest tour, The Last Domino? Tour, in April 2021. Track listing All songs written by Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford, except where noted. *Note: The CD liner notes state that track 7, \\"The Dividing Line\\", is 8:59.

The village was named after a 200-metre (650 ft) long sea-filled gorge that runs north to the sea from the village. History The village was first mentioned in 1584, but it seems to have existed long before then. It has long subsisted on fishing and selling dried and salted fish (klippfiskur in Faroese). At one time as many as 13 fishing boats sailed from Gj√≥gv. Its population has seen a sharp decline in the past 60 years or so. In 1950 the headcount still stood at 210. A factory producing prefabricated concrete elements was founded in the village in 1982. It employs 6 people and is the only one of its kind in the islands. Other branches of industry are represented by the village's fish farm and guest house / hostel and campsite. The gorge is the natural harbour of Gj√≥gv. Sights The village church dates from 1929. It was the first one to be consecrated in the village and the first one to feature services in Faroese. Before that, the villagers walked to Funningur for church and burial services. On the opposite side of the road a sculpture stands as a memorial to fishermen lost at sea, bearing the names and ages of men from the late nineteenth to the mid twentieth century. The sculpture of a mother and two children looking out to sea was created by Janus Kamban, (https://web.archive.org/web/20120206022835/http://www.gjogv.fo/Default.asp?sida=344 says: Fritjof Joensen) who has created a number of Faroese commemorative statues. The village school building dates back to 1884. It was built from boulders and was once in use by as many as 50 pupils. Now there are only three. The old village dance hall was renovated and extended in 1986 and now houses a community centre. All houses in the village conform to the prevailing colourful style of building in the Faroes, red, white and green being the predominant colours used. There are still about 50 houses left in the village. Due to the great decrease in population, about half of that number stand empty. The nearest grocery store is at Ei√∞i, but Gj√≥gv has a post office in a private home, which opens five days a week for 30 minutes each morning and afternoon. There is also a helicopter pad in the village, used mainly for emergency ambulance service or sea-rescue operations. Gj√≥gv has one of the best natural harbours in the Faroes. However, boats need to be pulled up on a ramp to be safe from the surf. To tourists and boating natives alike, the harbour in the gorge is also a well-known site of outstanding natural scenery. The village gets its name from the gorge, Faroese gj√≥gv is derived from the same Norse word (gj√≥) as the Shetland dialect geo. The inhabitants are known as Gj√°arf√≥lk, possibly related to the Icelandic word gj√° which itself comes from the Old Norse gj√≥ from which the village name is derived. Danish crown prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary visited Gj√≥gv on 22 June 2005. Two elderly inhabitants named Rita and Christian had the original idea of placing a bench with a magnificent view along the gorge towards the sea. The bench was baptised 'Mary's bench' (boldly proclaimed by a brass plaque attached to it) and the Crown Princess subsequently became the first to be seated on it. They were also serenaded by Faroese opera singer R√∫ni Brattaberg on this occasion. Gj√≥gv incline railway Track, wagon, and winch house of the Gj√≥gv incline railway. View along the railway line from the harbour. The Gj√≥gv incline railway is notable as the only operating railway in the Faroe Islands. Transport in the Faroe Islands has to engage with the undulating (and often mountainous) terrain, and the large number of bodies of water (mostly fjords and sea channels, but also lakes), all of which makes rail transport difficult to achieve. The incline railway operates a narrow-gauge line from the low- level harbour inside the gorge, up a steep incline to the boathouses of the upper village. The line terminates just in front of the village coffee house (Gj√°arkaffi). There are no locomotives, and motive power is provided by a winch operating a rope which is attached to the goods wagons. Although the railway is designed for freight transportation, it is a common sight to see local people riding on the wagons with the freight. The winch house is located at the top of the incline, overlooking the gorge. The rope passes from the winch house to the pivot through an underground channel, the route of which may be observed as a series of metal plates set into the road surface. From the pivot onwards the rope is attached to the wagons, and on the incline section of the line it passes over rollers set centrally between the rails of the permanent way. The incline railway was installed to transport goods offloaded from boats, at a time when road transport of commodities was difficult and unreliable, and most items arrived in the village by sea. Today delivery lorries come to the village to supply the commercial outlets (chiefly the hotel, the Post Office, and the coffee shop), and use of the incline railway has declined. It is, however, still serviceable, and still transports goods, and sometimes also small boats. Surroundings A number of tracks head up into the uplands north and west of the village. The highest peaks between Gj√≥gv and the neighbouring village of Ei√∞i are Sl√¶ttaratindur (882 m, 2,894 ft) and Gr√°felli (857 m, 2,812 ft). The valley of Ambadalur is located just northwest of Gj√≥gv. Just off the coast at Ambadalur the highest free- standing sea-stack in the Faroes is to be found. It reaches up to an astounding 188 metres (617 ft). Locally known as B√∫gvin, it offers a safe perch for multitudes of seabirds. The peaks of Tyril and Middagsfjall (601 m, 1,972 ft) are found east of Gj√≥gv. Both peaks offer a phenomenal view of Funningsfj√∏r√∞ur (Funningur's Fjord).

The product Levis created is different from the one produced since the 1990s, with Lon Adams developing the current Slim Jim recipe while working for Goodmark. Slim Jim is an example of a food product which is listed as containing mechanically separated chicken in its ingredients by requirement of the USDA. Production was interrupted after an explosion and fire on June 9, 2009 destroyed the plant in Garner, North Carolina, killing three workers. Operations resumed in Garner and in Troy, Ohio. On May 20, 2011, the facility in Garner closed, the same day that the company's former spokesman \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage died. Advertising campaigns A Slim Jim after removal of packaging From 1993 to 2000, advertising for the product included commercials that featured professional wrestler \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage, who served as spokesperson. Each commercial would close with Savage bellowing \\"Need a little excitement? Snap into a Slim Jim!\\" Other notable spokespersons have included rapper Vanilla Ice and wrestlers The Ultimate Warrior, Bam Bam Bigelow, Kevin Nash, and Edge. The advertising campaign was developed at North Castle Partners in Greenwich, Connecticut, by Tom Leland and Roger Martensen, under the creative direction of Hal Rosen. The \\"Snap Into A Slim Jim\\" concept was originally intended for comedian Sam Kinison, but he declined. Hal Rosen then suggested using WWF wrestlers, and The Ultimate Warrior was selected for the kickoff spot. In addition to a TV spot, the Ultimate Warrior also recorded several radio commercials for Slim Jim in 1991. A subsequent campaign featured Slim Jim Guy (played by actor Demetri Goritsas), a human personification of a Slim Jim who would wreak havoc on the digestive system of anyone who ate it and used the slogan \\"Eat me!\\" These ads personified the irreverent personality of the brand and were also from North Castle Partners. Slim Jim advertisements were also heavily featured on MTV, ESPN, WWF, and Disney Channel. Slim Jim was one of the earliest sponsors of the ASA Pro Tour (the aggressive inline skating tour) from 1997 - 2000. The ASA Pro Tour was a qualifier for ESPN's X Games. In 2005, Slim Jim advertising featured the Fairy Snapmother, described in a ConAgra press release as \\"a character resembling a tattooed rocker with wings - and a familiar MTV-type of humor young males enjoy.\\" Another campaign depicted hunters hunting a fictitious \\"Snapalope\\" within convenience stores using urban camouflage. The Snapalope is a deer-like puppet made from Slim Jims. In 2008, Slim Jim launched the website \\"SpicySide.com\\", encouraging consumers to get in touch with their \\"Spicy Side\\" by creating an avatar and fighting their friends in an online landscape called Spicy Town. Slim Jim also partnered with a well known Machinima artist Myndflame to develop a World of Warcraft parody. As of 2012, the company uses social media as a method of advertisement, using internet humour and memes to gain popularity online, creating an unofficial slogan of ‚ÄúLong Boi Gang‚Äù (referring to the snack itself). The Slim Jim account frequently comments on popular Instagram meme pages, and has gained a fair amount of popularity through this alone. Slim Jim sponsored Bobby Labonte and David Green when they won the NASCAR Busch Series championship in 1991 and 1994, respectively. Ingredients A 2009 Wired article listed some of the ingredients as beef, mechanically separated chicken, lactic acid starter culture, dextrose, salt, sodium nitrite and hydrolyzed soy. They note that although ConAgra refers to Slim Jim as a \\"meat stick\\", it resembles a fermented sausage, such as salami or pepperoni, which uses bacteria and sugar to produce lactic acid, lowering the pH of the sausage to around 5.0 and firming up the meat. Sodium nitrite is added to prevent the meat from turning gray, and hydrolyzed soy contains monosodium glutamate. Varieties Slim Jim has launched several spin-off products of its main brand. These products are often of higher quality than the original Slim Jim, using premium meats. Such products include both tender steak strips and beef jerky. The tender steak strips come in three flavors. Its companion beef jerky comes in three flavors: an original flavor and two spicy flavors.

At the 2006 census, Gladstone had a population of 629. The town services the surrounding district with two pubs, three churches, a bank, post office and several shops and small businesses providing basic goods and services. The closest hospital is 11 km away in a neighbouring rural town, but doctors take appointments in the town‚Äôs medical clinic. There is a kindergarten (approximately 12 enrollments), state primary school (63), Catholic primary school (60) and a secondary school (approximately 205 students, drawn from the wider district). Gladstone has sporting/social clubs providing for Aussie Rules football, netball, cricket, tennis, golf, lawn bowls, swimming (at the local outdoor pool) and soccer (newly formed for school-aged children), all seasonal. Sporting competitions occur between clubs from the neighbouring towns within a radius of about 75 km. Wheat and sheep are the main farming produce of the region, but Gladstone has the largest inland grain storage facility in the Southern Hemisphere, storing wheat, barley, durum wheat, peas, faba beans and fiesta beans. The Anglican Diocese of Willochra is based in Gladstone, with the Registry (the Diocesan Office) housed in building in the main street. In addition the Bishop of Willochra lives in Bishop's House which is on the Main North Road. Gladstone was the home of Trend Drinks, a local soft drink manufacturer, from its founding in 1876 until it moved to Corowa, New South Wales in 2016. History The town of Gladstone was privately laid out by Matthew Moorhouse east of the railway line in October 1872 on Section 31, Hundred of Yangya. A government town named Booyoolie was laid out in March 1875 on the western side of the railway line in the Hundred of Booyoolie. In 1940, Booyoolie was renamed Gladstone to match the private town and railway station. The name Gladstone is derived from William Ewart Gladstone, a Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. During World War II, the RAAF No. 28 Inland Aircraft Fuel Depot was established near Gladstone. It consisted of large tanks concealed under earthen mounds. The Gladstone depot was one of 31 fuel depots established across Australia in places that were remote from airfields and immune to naval attack.

Gladstone is located on the main Crystal Brook-Broken Hill railway line, with branches going north and south. Originally, all the lines were gauge narrow gauge railways, starting with the line from Port Pirie in 1875, extended to Petersburg (now Peterborough) in 1880 and to Cockburn (on the state border near Broken Hill) in 1888. A branch from Gladstone to Laura in 1884 was extended to Wilmington in 1915. The line from the south (extending the line that terminated at Blyth) was completed in 1894. In 1927, the line from Hamley Bridge through Blythe to Gladstone was converted to broad gauge, making Gladstone a break-of-gauge junction.Horse and Steam, Wheat and Copper Callaghan, W.H. Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, January;February, 2002 pp9-27;46-63 In 1970, the line from Port Pirie to Broken Hill was converted to standard gauge making Gladstone into a rare three-gauge break-of-gauge junction as the Wilmington railway line to the north remained an isolated narrow gauge line.The Triple-gauge Track of Gladstone Vincent, Graham Australian Railway History, December, 2007 pp474-479 In the 1980s, the broad and narrow gauge lines were closed, leaving Gladstone as a purely standard gauge station.

In his fight for a strong, unified Germany he opposed ethnocentrism and it was his strong belief that no one people should rule over another. As such he was an opponent of the Prussian occupation of Poland and was in contact with the revolutionists there. Blum was a critic of antisemitism, supported the German Catholic sect, and agitated for the equality of the sexes. Although claiming immunity as a member of the National Assembly, he was arrested during a stay at the hotel \\"Stadt London\\" in Vienna and executed for his role in the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states. Biography Memorial tablet at \\"Fischmarkt\\" in Cologne where Robert Blum was born Inscript: \\"Born at this place on November 10 in 1807, shot at Vienna on November 9, 1848; I die for the German liberty that I fought for. May the fatherland remember me.\\" Blum grew up in poverty in Cologne, the son of a failed theologian who made a poor living as a cooper. He was ten years old before he could go to school. After his schooling, he worked as a craftsman in different trades. He failed as a goldsmith's apprentice, but completed an apprenticeship as a gardener. After his journeyman's time, he returned to Cologne to work in a lamp factory. His employer put him to work at the counter since he was good at calculations. In 1829, he followed his employer to Berlin where he also continued his education. His work was interrupted by obligatory military service, and on his release, his poor circumstances obliged him to return to Cologne. There, in 1830, he worked serving in a theater company and started writing politically motivated poetry and plays. When the theater closed in the summer, he worked for a sheriff as a scribe. The political upheavals of 1830 attracted his interest, and ideals of freedom found their way into his poetry. In 1832, he followed the theater troupe to Leipzig. There he came in touch with humanist and liberal circles, contributed to the liberal newspaper Zeitung f√ºr die elegante Welt and joined Leipzig's freemason lodge. By 1840, he had worked his way up to being a cashier in the city theater. That year he also founded the Schillerverein in Leipzig which celebrated the poet's anniversary as a festival in honor of political liberty. Beginning in 1839, Blum became a leading figure in the Kingdom of Saxony's national-liberal circles; as a gifted orator and organizer, he helped establish Saxony's opposition movement as a serious political force. His initial attempt at a newsletter was suppressed by the censor, but another one continued for four years with occasional lapses due to the censor. He became a German Catholic when Johannes Ronge came to Leipzig, and wrote on that movement's behalf. In 1845, Blum organized the first German Catholic synod in Leipzig that marked the beginning of Germany's humanist free religious movement. In 1844, he gave up his theater job to found a book store. Painting by Ludwig von Elliott of the Frankfurt Parliament during a speech by Robert Blum, 1848 In 1845, the presence of John of Saxony stirred the masses and the military fired on them. At a turbulent meeting of armed citizens and students of Leipzig, Blum dissuaded them from storming the barracks, and urged conformity to the law. This resulted in his being elected a representative in Leipzig's government. Blum embraced the upheavals of 1848. He was one of the presidents of the preliminary parliament at Frankfurt which he dominated with his energy, imposing figure and pithy speeches. As a member of the succeeding parliament and leader of the left, he worked to contain the most radical elements. Blum's trustworthiness was questioned when the extreme leftist Arnold Ruge claimed Blum had moved toward his side. As the leader of the radical liberal faction, he strongly opposed the Malm√∂ Treaty between Denmark and Prussia that abolished Schleswig-Holstein's democratically elected government. He was also one of the most vocal supporters of popular sovereignty. Painting by Carl Steffeck of the execution of Robert Blum, 1848 In October, when revolutionary fighting broke out in Vienna, Blum travelled there and joined the revolutionary forces. On the surrender of the capital to Windischgr√§tz, Blum was arrested with several of his companions on 4 November. Brought before a military tribunal, he pleaded in vain his privileges as a deputy from the German Diet and was condemned to be hanged, a sentence which was changed to death by the bullet. He was executed on 9 November. His death became a symbol for the futility of Germany's 1848 rebellion; the day of his death marks the first of a series of events that led to November 9 being referred to as Germany's Schicksalstag (fateful day). His son Hans Blum was a noted writer and journalist.

McCririck began his career at The Sporting Life, where he twice won at the British Press Awards for his campaigning journalism, but his role was terminated in 1984. In 1981, he joined ITV Sport's horse racing coverage which moved, during 1984 and 1985, to Channel 4 as Channel 4 Racing. In October 2012, the channel announced that he would be dropped from its team, which McCririck blamed on ageism and took the matter to an employment tribunal, but lost the case. From the 1980s, McCrirck has appeared as a contestant on numerous television shows, including Bullseye, Celebrity Big Brother, The Weakest Link, Wife Swap, Celebrity Poker Club, and After Dark.  Early life  Born in Surbiton, Surrey, McCririck was educated at Elizabeth College, Guernsey,Elizabeth College Register, Volume IV (1940‚Äì1975), student number 4720, p. 182, compiled by Keith Bichard, published 2000 in Guernsey Victoria College, Jersey, and Harrow School, where his fellow pupils included Julian Wilson, later a fellow racing journalist. He left with three O-Levels, having also run the book on cross country races.  Career  After failing to get into the diplomatic service, McCririck was briefly a waiter at The Dorchester hotel. During the era when off-course betting was illegal in the UK, he worked for an illegal bookmaker, before becoming a bookmaker himself, at which he admitted to having failed. He then became a tic-tac man. He began his career in journalism at The Sporting Life, where he twice won at the British Press Awards for his campaigning journalism; he was sacked in 1984. He joined the Daily Star, but was later sacked by the newspaper after allegations emerged that he was in debt to his bookmaker; he later successfully sued the paper at an employment tribunal. Having previously become a results sub-editor on the BBC's Grandstand, from 1981 he joined ITV Sport's horse racing coverage; he had previously appeared in a debate about fox hunting on the ITV children's programme Saturday Banana in 1978. During 1984 and 1985, horse racing moved from ITV to Channel 4 as Channel 4 Racing, where his role was expanded and he reported from the betting ring. His signature flamboyant attire of a large deerstalker hat, sideburns, and brightly coloured matching suits and trousers, coupled with huge cigars, became a recognisable personal style. McCririck (far right), with trademark cigar, on Channel 4's After Dark on 9 April 1988 In 1988, on the evening after the Grand National, he made an extended appearance on the After Dark topical discussion programme on Channel 4, alongside Barney Curley and the Duchess of Argyll, in an episode entitled \\"Horse Racing, Sport Of Kings?\\" In October 2012 Channel 4 announced that McCririck would not be included in the team presenting racing from January 2013, which McCririck blamed on ageism, taking Channel 4 to an employment tribunal. On 13 November the tribunal ruled against McCririck saying, \\"All the evidence is that Mr McCririck's pantomime persona, as demonstrated on the celebrity television appearances, and his persona when appearing on Channel 4 Racing, together with his self-described bigoted and male chauvinist views were clearly unpalatable to a wider audience.\\" The panel was told by witnesses from the television station and IMG (the production company) that he was dropped because he was \\"offensive\\" and \\"disgusting\\".Claire Duffin \\"'Unpalatable' John McCririck loses his age discrimination case against Channel 4\\", The Daily Telegraph, 13 November 2013 In December 2018 McCririck joined the editorial team at The Racing Paper as a weekly columnist.  Other media appearances  McCririck appeared on the 1991 Bullseye Christmas Special, winning the top prize for his chosen charity, the Sue Ryder Foundation. He also appeared in the Celebrity Poker Club television series, reaching the Grand Finale of series one, won by Sir Clive Sinclair. McCririck also appeared during ITV's snooker coverage in a betting capacity. In 1997, McCririck was tricked by two separate episodes of spoof TV show Brass Eye, once in an item about artificial insemination and another in an item about Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe appearing as himself in a musical, while on day-release from prison. In January 2005, he was a contestant in the third series of Celebrity Big Brother. He competed on The Weakest Link. In April 2005, McCririck appeared on an episode of Hell's Kitchen (season 3, episode 8) in which Head Chef Marco Pierre White refused to serve him after McCririck told him that his consomm√© was 'greasy', in spite of being informed that it contained foie gras and truffle oil. White commented after the sequence, \\"I know John. He's awkward, he's got no taste. All you have to do is look at how he dresses.\\" In 2006, he appeared in the episode Drama on the show Still Game, playing himself on Channel 4 Racing telling Winston Ingram which horse to back. McCririck was a housemate in Ultimate Big Brother in August 2010. In 2011, he was featured in the fourth episode of the British version of Celebrity Ghost Stories recounting his experiences of a haunted passageway at Harrow School. On 26 June 2015, on the sixteenth series of Big Brother, it was announced that McCririck would be returning to Big Brother, taking part in Big Brother's Hotel from Hell the following week, where he would be staying in the house and other ex-housemates would join him on Monday 29 June.  Personal life  McCririck married Jennifer Barnes in 1970 and referred to her as \\"The Booby\\". He was accused of frequent misogyny. In 2006, the couple took part in Wife Swap alongside Edwina Currie and her husband. McCririck was also a well-known supporter of Newcastle United F.C. In early 2018, McCririck contracted influenza which resulted in a chest infection. The illness caused him to suffer dramatic weight loss. McCririck died at a London hospital on 5 July 2019, after a short illness with lung cancer; he was aged 79. Writing in The Guardian on the day McCririck died, racing correspondent Chris Cook said: \\"He was outrageous, in both speech and appearance, because what he wanted most of all was a reaction and so he enlivened many a broadcast or social occasion that might otherwise have fallen rather flat... While McCririck thrived on the attention his persona brought him, the buffoon act sold him short. He was a skilled journalist whose investigations uncovered a couple of betting-related scandals in the 70s. The producers of Channel 4 Racing almost invariably turned to McCririck when there was a serious interview to be done.\\" On 12 July McCririck was featured in the BBC Radio 4 obituary programme Last Word.

Description Head from the description by Gray as Kobus maria Males are an average of long and tall at the shoulders, and weigh between , while females are an average of long, tall at the shoulders, and weigh . Nile lechwes live an average of 10 to 11.5 years, and most uncommonly 19 years. Their coats are shaggy with the hair on the cheeks particularly long in both sexes, and males may have even longer hair on their necks. Nile lechwe exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism. Females are golden-brown with white underbellies and no horns. Juveniles also have a golden-brown coat, but the color changes to dark brown in young males when they reach two to three years of age. Adult males are blackish-brown to russet with white 'hoods' over their shoulders and small white patches over their eyes. The horns of the adult males are long, strongly ridged at their bases and are curved at the tips. Ecology Nile lechwe can visually signal and vocalize to communicate with each other. They rear high in the air in front of their opponents and turn their heads to the side while displaying. Females are quite loud, making a toad-like croaking when moving. When fighting, males duck their heads and use their horns to push against each other. If one male is significantly smaller than the other, he may move next to the larger male in a parallel position and push from there, which prevents the larger male from pushing with all his force. Known predators are humans, lions, Nile crocodiles, Cape hunting dogs and leopards. They flee to water if disturbed, but females defend their offspring from smaller predators by direct attack, mainly kicking. Yearling Nile lechwes are often infected by warble flies, which can make them unhealthy and result in high mortality rates. Nile lechwe are crepuscular, active in the early morning and late afternoon. They gather in herds of up to 50 females and one male or in smaller all-male herds. They divide themselves into three social groups: females and their new offspring, bachelor males, and mature males with territories. A males with territory sometimes allows a bachelor male into his territory to guard the region and not to copulate. Diet The main diet of the Nile lechwe mostly includes grasses. Here a male (blackish) together with a sitatunga Nile lechwe feed on succulent grasses and water plants. Wild rice is thought to be a preferred food at the start of the flood season, while a larger proportion of swamp grasses are consumed when the waters recede. They have the special capability to wade in shallow waters and swim in deeper waters, and may feed on young leaves from trees and bushes, rearing up to reach this green vegetation. Nile lechwe are also found in marshy areas, where they eat aquatic plants. Reproduction Both sexes reach sexual maturity when they are two years old. Mating occurs throughout the year, but peaks between February and May. During mating season, young males bend their horns to the ground as if to poke the earth. Males fight in the water, their heads submerging in horn-to-horn combat, for dominance. These contests are usually short and violent. As in many other animals, the dominant male copulates with the female. A unique form of marking is seen with the start of mating. The male bends his head to the ground and urinates on his throat and cheek hair. He then rubs his dripping beard on the female's forehead and rump. The gestation period is seven to 9 months long on average, after which a single calf is born. Infants weigh about . Females experience estrus again about a month after producing young. After its birth, the calf is kept hidden in thick vegetation for two to three weeks, where the mother nurses it. It is weaned at five to six months, and a few months later is ready to be independent and join the herd. Habitat and distribution The Nile lechwe typically occur in shallow waters bordering deeper swamps, where the water is deep. Nile lechwe are endemic to South Sudan and Ethiopia. In South Sudan, the majority of the population occurs in the Sudd swamps, and in the Machars near the Ethiopian border in smaller numbers. In Ethiopia occurs in the southwest, in Gambela National Park, but in very less numbers possibly due to human settlement and habitat degradation. The habitat of the Nile lechwe has been severely affected by civil wars, human displacement and resettlement, firearm attacks and increased hunting. Even its seasonal movements were restricted due to large populations of cattle in and around its range. The Nile lechwe population in the Sudds, however, remained somewhat stable throughout this period.  Conservation  The Nile lechwe has been classified under the Endangered category by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). In 1983, aerial surveys gave a total population estimate of 30,000-40,000 individuals, of which 95 percent were concentrated in the Sudds and the rest occurred between Sudan and Ethiopia. In the 1980s, the population in the Machars was estimated at 900. A population of around 150 was also reported from the swamps in Gilo River in 1967. There is also an increasing population held in captivity. In 2007, the population of the Sudd region was estimated to be of 4,291 animals, indicating that the species has declined rapidly since the previous survey in 1983. In South Sudan, Nile lechwe populations occur in three protected areas : Zeraf Game Reserve, that extends over along the Bahr el Zeraf; Fanyikang Game Reserve, north of Bahr el Ghazal, covering over ; and Shambe National Park, that stretches over along Bahr al Jabal. The Nile lechwe keep moving in and out of these areas. In Ethiopia they occur in the Gabella National Park. A study outlined priorities for both in situ and ex situ conservation of this species.

Marimo are eukaryotic . The species can be found in a number of lakes and rivers in Japan and Northern Europe.: Figure 4 Colonies of marimo balls are known to form in Japan and Iceland, but their population has been declining. Classification and name Marimo were first described in the 1820s by Anton E. Sauter, found in Lake Zell, Austria. The genus Aegagropila was established by Friedrich T. K√ºtzing (1843) with A. linnaei as the type species based on its formation of spherical aggregations, but all the Aegagropila species were transferred to subgenus Aegagropila of genus Cladophora later by the same author (K√ºtzing 1849). Subsequently, A. linnaei was placed in the genus Cladophora in the Cladophorales and was renamed Cladophora aegagropila (L.) Rabenhorst and Cl. sauteri (Nees ex K√ºtz.) K√ºtz. Extensive DNA research in 2002 returned the name to Aegagropila linnaei. The presence of chitin in the cell walls makes it distinct from the genus Cladophora. The plant was named marimo by the Japanese botanist Takiya Kawakami in 1898. Mari is a bouncy play ball. Mo is a generic term for plants that grow in water. The native names in Ainu are torasampe (lake goblin) and tokarip (lake roller).Irimoto, Takashi. 2004. Creation of the Marimo Festival: Ainu Identity and Ethnic Symbiosis. Senri Ethnological Studies 66:11‚Äì38. They are sometimes sold in aquariums under the name \\"Japanese moss balls\\" although they are unrelated to moss. In Iceland the lake balls are called k√∫lusk√≠tur by the local fishermen at Lake M√Ωvatn (k√∫la = ball, sk√≠tur = muck) where the \\"muck\\" is any weeds that get entangled in their fishing nets. The generic name Aegagropila is Greek for \\"goat hair\\". Growth forms Three common growth forms of Aegagropila linnaei: as a ball, free-floating filaments, and growth on rocks. The algae has three growth forms: * It can grow on rocks, usually found on the shaded side of the rocks. * It can exist as free-floating filaments. Small tufts of unattached filaments frequently form a carpet on the muddy lake bottom. * It can form a lake ball where the algae grow into sizable balls of densely packed algal filaments that radiate from the center. The balls do not have a kernel of any sort. A cross section of a marimo colony in Lake M√Ωvatn. Ecology Lake Akan and Mount Oakan in Japan. The existence of marimo colonies depends on the adaptation of the species to low light conditions, combined with the dynamic interaction of wind-induced currents, light regime, lake morphology, bottom substrate and sedimentation. = Size = The growth rate of marimo is about per year. In Lake Akan in Japan they grow particularly large, up to . Lake M√Ωvatn, Iceland, had dense colonies of marimo that grow to about in diameter and formed well defined patches on the lake floor at depths ranging from . = Shape = The round shape of the marimo is maintained by gentle wave action that occasionally turns it. The best environment for that are shallow lakes with sandy bottoms. The balls are green all the way round which guarantees that they can photosynthesize no matter which side is turned upwards. Inside, the ball is also green and packed with dormant chloroplasts which become active in a matter of hours if the ball breaks apart. The wave action also cleans the balls of dead organic material. As some colonies have two or even three layers of marimo balls, wave action is needed to tumble them around so each ball reaches the light. The spherical shape has a low surface-area-to-volume ratio compared to a leaf, which limits photosynthesis and therefore limits the maximum size of the marimo balls. = Habitat = Marimo's preferred habitat is in lakes with a low or moderate biological activity, and with moderate or high levels of calcium. = Distribution = The species is mainly found in the areas of Europe previously covered in glaciers (Northern-Europe), and in several places in Japan. It has been found in North America, but it is rare, as well as in Australia. =Population decline= The species is sensitive to the amount of nutrients in the water. An excess of nutrients (due to agriculture and fish farming), along with mud deposition from human activity are thought to be the main causes for its disappearance from many lakes. The species still exists in Lake Zeller in Austria (where it was first discovered in the 1820s) but the lake ball growth form has not been found there since around 1910. The same has happened in most locations in England and Scotland, where mainly the attached form can be found. Lake M√Ωvatn in Iceland. Dense colonies of marimo were discovered in Lake M√Ωvatn in Iceland in 1978, but they have shrunk considerably since then. By 2014 the marimo had almost completely disappeared from the lake due to an excess of nutrients. The species can still be found in several places in Japan, but populations have also declined there. At Lake Akan, a great effort is spent on the conservation of the lake balls. The marimo has been a protected species in Japan since the 1920s, and in Iceland since 2006. Lake Akan is protected as a national park and Lake M√Ωvatn is protected as a nature reserve. A. linnaei grown in a conical flask at home.  Cultural aspects  Marimo balls are a rare curiosity. In Japan, the Ainu people hold a three-day marimo festival every October at Lake Akan. Because of their appealing appearance, the lake balls also serve as a medium for environmental education. Small balls sold as souvenirs are hand rolled from free-floating filaments. A widely marketed stuffed toy character known as Marimokkori takes the anthropomorphic form of the marimo algae as one part of its design. Marimo are sometimes sold for display in aquariums; those often originate from Ukrainian lakes such as the Shatskyi Lakes. Balls sold in Japanese aquarium shops are of European origin; collecting them from Lake Akan is prohibited. References Bibliography  * Nagasawa, S., Wakana, I. and Nagao, M. 1994.

It is placed in the genus Kobus of the family Bovidae. It was first described by Irish naturalist William Ogilby in 1833. The thirteen subspecies are grouped under two varieties: the common or Ellipsiprymnus waterbuck and the Defassa waterbuck. The head-and-body length is typically between and the average height is between . A sexually dimorphic antelope, males are taller as well as heavier than females. Males reach approximately at the shoulder, while females reach . Males typically weigh and females . The coat colour varies from brown to grey. The long, spiral horns, present only on males, curve backward, then forward and are long. Waterbuck are rather sedentary in nature. A gregarious animal, the waterbuck may form herds consisting of six to 30 individuals. These groups are either nursery herds with females and their offspring or bachelor herds. Males start showing territorial behaviour from the age of five years, but are most dominant from the age of six to nine. The waterbuck cannot tolerate dehydration in hot weather, and thus inhabits areas close to sources of water. Predominantly a grazer, the waterbuck is mostly found on grassland. In equatorial regions, breeding takes place throughout the year, but births are at their peak in the rainy season. The gestational period lasts for seven to eight months, followed by the birth of a single calf. Waterbuck inhabit scrub and savanna areas along rivers, lakes and valleys. Due to their requirement for grasslands as well as water, the waterbuck have a sparse ecotone distribution. The IUCN lists the waterbuck as being of Least Concern. More specifically, the common waterbuck is listed as of Least Concern while the defassa waterbuck is Near Threatened. The population trend for both the common and defassa waterbuck is downwards, especially that of the latter, with large populations being eliminated from certain habitats because of poaching and human disturbance.  Taxonomy and etymology  The scientific name of the waterbuck is Kobus ellipsiprymnus. The waterbuck is one of the six species of the genus Kobus and belongs to the family Bovidae. It was first described by Irish naturalist William Ogilby in 1833. The generic name Kobus is a New Latin word, originating from an African name, koba. The specific name ellipsiprymnus refers to the white elliptical ring on the rump, from the Greek ' (ellipse) and ' (', hind part). The animal acquired the vernacular name \\"waterbuck\\" due to its heavy dependence on water as compared to other antelopes and its ability to enter into water for defence. The type specimen of the waterbuck was collected by South African hunter-explorer Andrew Steedman in 1832. This specimen was named Antilope ellipsiprymnus by Ogilby in 1833. This species was transferred to the genus Kobus in 1840, becoming K. ellipsiprymnus. It is usually known as the common waterbuck. In 1835, German naturalist Eduard R√ºppell collected another specimen, which differed from Steedman's specimen in having a prominent white ring on its rump. Considering it a separate species, R√ºppell gave it the Amharic name \\"defassa\\" waterbuck and scientific name Antilope defassa. Modern taxonomists, however, consider the common waterbuck and the defassa waterbuck a single species, K. ellipsiprymnus, given the large number of instances of hybridisation between the two. Interbreeding between the two takes place in the Nairobi National Park owing to extensive overlapping of habitats. =Evolution= Not many fossils of the waterbuck have been found. Fossils were scarce in the Cradle of Humankind, occurring only in a few pockets of the Swartkrans. On the basis of Valerius Geist's theories about the relation of social evolution and dispersal in ungulates during the Pleistocene, the ancestral home of the waterbuck is considered to be the eastern coast of Africa - with the Horn of Africa to the north and the East African Rift Valley to the west. =Subspecies= 37 subspecies of the waterbucks had been initially recognised on the basis of coat colour. They were classified into two groups: the ellipsen waterbuck group and the defassa waterbuck group. Owing to the large number of variations in the coat colour in the defassa waterbuck group, as many as 29 subspecies were included in it; the ellipsen waterbuck group consisted of eight subspecies. In 1971, however, the number of subspecies was reduced to thirteen (four for the ellipsen waterbuck group and nine for the defassa waterbuck group). Though they occur in Zambia as well, their ranges are separated by relief features or by the Muchinga escarpment. The subspecies have been listed below (along with notes about the former subspecies which were recombined into a single subspecies): * K. e. ellipsiprymnus (ellipsen waterbuck, common or ringed waterbuck) group: Found in the Webi Shebeli river valley in southeastern Ethiopia; the Juba and Webi Shebeli river valleys in Somalia; essentially east of the Rift Valley in Kenya and Tanzania; east of the Rift Valley in the middle Zambezi and Luangwa valleys in Zambia; Malawi; Mozambique; east of the Kwando River in the Caprivi Strip of Namibia; eastern and northern Botswana; Zimbabwe; and eastern and northern Transvaal in South Africa. Its distribution slightly overlaps that of the typical defassa along the Rift Valley in Kenya and Tanzania, and that of the Crawshay defassa in the Rift Valley in Zambia. :Includes the following four subspecies: :* K. e. ellipsiprymnus Ogilby, 1833 (southern Africa) :* K. e. kondensis Matschie, 1911 (including K. e. lipuwa, K. e. kulu) (southern Tanzania) :* K. e. pallidus Matschie, 1911 (Webi Shebeli drainage in Ethiopia, and Juba and Webi Shebeli drainages in Somalia) :* K. e. thikae Matschie, 1910 (including K. e. kuru and K. e. canescens) (southern and eastern Kenya and northeastern Tanzania) * K. e. defassa (defassa waterbuck) group: Found west of the Gregory Rift, ranging from Ethiopia west to Senegal and south to Zambia. :Includes the following subspecies: :*Angolan defassa waterbuck (K. e. penricei) W.

It is a sexually dimorphic antelope, with the males nearly 7 percent taller than females and around 8 percent longer. The head-and-body length is typically between and the average height is between . Males reach approximately at the shoulder, while females reach . The waterbuck is one of the heaviest antelopes. a newborn typically weighs , and growth in weight is faster in males than in females. Males typically weigh and females . The tail is long. The waterbuck is of a robust build. The shaggy coat is reddish brown to grey, and becomes progressively darker with age. Males are darker than females. Though apparently thick, the hair is sparse on the coat. The hair on the neck is, however, long and shaggy. When sexually excited, the skin of the waterbuck secretes a greasy substance with the odour of musk, giving it the name \\"greasy kob\\". The odor of this is so unpleasant that it repels predators. This secretion also assists in water-proofing the body when the animal dives into water. The facial features include a white muzzle and light eyebrows and lighter insides of the ears. There is a cream-coloured patch (called \\"bib\\") on the throat. Waterbuck are characterised by a long neck and short, strong and black legs. Females have two nipples. Preorbital glands, foot glands and inguinal glands are absent. The common waterbuck and the defassa waterbuck are remarkably different in their physical appearances. Measurements indicate greater tail length in the latter, whereas the common waterbuck stand taller than the defassa waterbuck. However, the principal differentiation between the two types is the white ring of hair surrounding the tail on the rump, which is a hollow circle in the common waterbuck but covered with white hair in the defassa waterbuck. The long, spiral horns curve backward, then forward. Found only on males, the horns range from in length. To some extent, the length of the horns is related to the bull's age. A rudimentary horn in the form of a bone lump may be found on the skulls of females. Ecology and behaviour A female herd in the Samburu National Park (Kenya) Waterbuck are rather sedentary in nature, though some migration may occur with the onset of monsoon. A gregarious animal, the waterbuck may form herds consisting of six to 30 individuals. The various groups are the nursery herds, bachelor herds and territorial males. Herd size increases in summer, whereas groups fragment in the winter months, probably under the influence of food availability. As soon as young males start developing horns (at around seven to nine months of age), they are chased out of the herd by territorial bulls. These males then form bachelor herds and may roam in female home ranges. Females have home ranges stretching over . A few females may form spinster herds. Though females are seldom aggressive, minor tension may arise in herds. Males start showing territorial behaviour from the age of five years, but are most dominant from the age of six to nine. Territorial males hold territories in size. Males are inclined to remain settled in their territories, though over time they may leave inferior territories for more spacious ones. Marking of territories includes no elaborate rituals - dung and urine are occasionally dropped. After the age of ten years, males lose their territorial nature and replaced by a younger bull, following which they recede to a small and unprotected area. There is another social group, that of the satellite males, which are mature bulls as yet without their own territories, who exploit resources, particularly mating opportunities, even in the presence of the dominant bull. The territorial male may allow a few satellite males into his territory, and they may contribute to its defence. However, gradually they may deprive the actual owner of his territory and seize the area for themselves. In a study in the Lake Nakuru National Park, only 7 percent of the adult males held territories, and only half of the territorial males tolerated one or more satellite males. Territorial males may use several kinds of display. In one type of display, the white patch on the throat and between the eyes is clearly revealed, and other displays can demonstrate the thickness of the neck. These activities frighten trespassers. Lowering of the head and the body depict submission before the territorial male, who stands erect. Fights, which may last up to thirty minutes, involve threat displays typical of bovids accompanied by snorting. Fights may even become so violent that one of the opponents meets its death due to severe abdominal or thoracic wounds. A silent animal, the waterbuck makes use of flehmen response for visual communication and alarm snorts for vocal communication. Waterbuck often enter water to escape from predators which include lions, leopards, cheetahs, African wild dogs and Nile crocodiles (leopards and spotted hyenas prey on juveniles). However, it has been observed that the waterbuck does not particularly like being in water. Waterbuck may run into cover when alarmed, and males often attack predators. =Diseases and parasites= Waterbuck are susceptible to ulcers, lungworm infection and kidney stones. Other diseases from which these animals suffer are foot-and-mouth disease, sindbis fever, yellow fever, bluetongue, bovine virus diarrhoea, brucellosis and anthrax. The waterbuck is more resistant to rinderpest than are other antelopes. They are unaffected by tsetse flies but ticks may introduce parasitic protozoa such as Theileria parva, Anaplasma marginale and Baberia bigemina. 27 species of ixodid tick have been found on waterbuck - a healthy waterbuck may carry a total of over 4000 ticks in their larval or nymphal stages, the most common among them being Amblyomma cohaerens and Rhipicephalus tricuspis. Internal parasites found in waterbuck include tapeworms, liverflukes, stomachflukes and several helminths. Diet The waterbuck is predominantly a grazer. The waterbuck exhibits great dependence on water. It can not tolerate dehydration in hot weather, and thus inhabits areas close to sources of water. However, it has been observed that unlike the other members of its genus (such as the kob and puku), the waterbuck ranges farther into the woodlands while maintaining its proximity to water. With grasses constituting a substantial 70 to 95 percent of the diet, the waterbuck is predominantly a grazer frequenting grasslands. Reeds and rushes like Typha and Phragmites may also be preferred. A study found regular consumption of three grass species round the year: Panicum anabaptistum, Echinochloa stagnina and Andropogon gayanus. Hyparrhenia involucrata, Acroceras amplectens and Oryza barthii along with annual species were the main preference in the early rainy season, while long life grasses and forage from trees constituted three-fourths of the diet in the dry season. Though the defassa waterbuck were found to have a much greater requirement for protein than the African buffalo and the Beisa oryx, the waterbuck was found to spend much less time on browsing (eating leaves, small shoots and fruits) in comparison to the other grazers. In the dry season about 32 percent of the 24-hour day was spent in browsing, whereas no time was spent on it during the wet season. The choice of grasses varies with location rather than availability; for instance, in western Uganda, while Sporobolus pyramidalis was favoured in some places, Themeda triandra was the main choice elsewhere. The common waterbuck and the defassa waterbuck in the same area may differ in their choices; it has been observed that while the former preferred Heteropogon contortus and Cynodon dactylon, the latter showed less preference for these grasses. Reproduction A female waterbuck with her young Waterbuck are slower than other antelopes in terms of the rate of maturity. While males become sexually mature at the age of six years, females reach maturity within two to three years. Females may conceive by the age of two- and-a-half years, and remain reproductive for another ten years. In equatorial regions, breeding takes place throughout the year, and births are at their peak in the rainy season. However, breeding is seasonal in the Sudan (south of Sahara), with the mating season lasting four months. The season extends for even longer periods in some areas of southern Africa. Oestrus lasts for a day or less. Mating begins after the male confirms that the female is in oestrus, which he does by sniffing her vulva and urine. A resistive female would try to bite or even fight off an advancing male. The male exhibits flehmen, and often licks the neck of the female and rubs his face and the base of his horns against her back. There are several attempts at mounting before the actual copulation. The female shifts her tail to one side, while the male clasps her sides with his forelegs and rests on her back during copulation, which may occur as many as ten times. The gestational period lasts for seven to eight months, followed by the birth of a single calf. Twins are rare. Pregnant females isolate themselves in thickets as parturition approaches. Newborn calves can stand on their feet within a half-hour of birth. The mother eats the afterbirth. She communicates with the calf by bleating or snorting. Calves are kept hidden from two to three weeks up to two months. At about three to four weeks, the calf begins following its mother, who signals it to do so by raising her tail. Though bereft of horns, mothers will fiercely defend their offspring from predators. Calves are weaned at eight months, following which time they join groups of calves of their own age. Young females remain with their mothers in nursery herds, or may also join bachelor herds. The waterbuck lives to 18 years in the wild and 30 years in captivity. Distribution and habitat Waterbuck inhabit grasslands close to water. The waterbuck is native to southern and eastern Africa (including countries such as Angola, Botswana, The Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda) besides a few countries of western and northern Africa such as Chad, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal. Though formerly widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, its numbers have now decreased in most areas. The common waterbuck is found east of the Eastern African Rift. Its southern range extends to the Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game Reserve (KwaZulu Natal) and to central Namibia. By contrast, the defassa waterbuck inhabits western and central Africa. The defassa waterbuck occurs west of the Albertine Rift and ranges from Eritrea to Guinea Bissau in the southern Sahel, its most northerly point of distribution being in southern Mali. Its range also stretches east of the Congo basin through Zambia into Angola, while another branch extends to the Zaire River west of the Congo basin. While the common waterbuck is now extinct in Ethiopia, the defassa waterbuck has become extinct in Gambia. Waterbuck inhabit scrub and savanna areas alongside rivers, lakes and valleys. Due to their requirement for grasslands as well as water, the waterbuck have a sparse distribution across ecotones (areas of interface between two different ecosystems). A study in the Ruwenzori Range showed that the mean density of waterbuck was 5.5 per square mile, and estimates in the Maasai Mara were as low as 1.3 per square mile. It has been observed that territorial size depends on the quality of the habitat, the age and health of the animal and the population density. The greater the age of the animal or the denser the populations, the smaller are the territories. In Queen Elizabeth National Park, females had home ranges in area whereas home ranges for bachelor males averaged between . The oldest female (around 18 years old) had the smallest home range. Threats and conservation The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) lists the waterbuck as of least concern (LC). More specifically, the common waterbuck is listed as of Least Concern while the defassa waterbuck is near threatened (NT). The population trend for both the common and defassa waterbuck is decreasing, especially that of the latter, with large populations being eliminated from their habitats due to poaching and human settlement. Their own sedentary nature too is responsible for this to some extent. Numbers have fallen in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Murchison Falls National Park, Akagera National Park, Lake Nakuru National Park, and Como√© National Park. Population decrease in the Lake Nakuru National Park has been attributed to heavy metal poisoning. While cadmium and lead levels were dangerously high in the kidney and the liver, deficiencies of copper, calcium and phosphorus were noted. Over 60 percent of the defassa waterbuck populations thrive in protected areas, most notably in Niokolo-Koba, Comoe, Mole, Bui, Pendjari, Manovo-Gounda St. Floris, Moukalaba-Doudou, Garamba, Virunga, Omo, Mago, Murchison Falls, Serengeti, and Katavi, Kafue and Queen Elizabeth National Parks, the national parks and hunting zones of North Province (Cameroon), Ugalla River Forest Reserve, Nazinga Game Ranch, Rukwa Valley, Awash Valley, Murule and Arly-Singou. The common waterbuck occurs in Tsavo, Tarangire, Mikumi, Kruger and Lake Nakuru National Parks, Laikipia, Kajiado, Luangwa Valley, Selous and Hluhluwe-Umfolozi game reserves and private lands in South Africa. Research Scientists with the ICIPE have developed tsetse-fly- repellant collars for cattle based on the smell of the waterbuck.

It is on State Highway 1, south of Amberley and north of Christchurch and 11.8 kilometers north of Waikuku. The Leithfield area consists of two semi-distinct areas, Leithfield Beach to the east of State Highway 1 and Leithfield Village adjacent to and immediately to the west of State Highway 1. Leithfield sits just south of the South Branch of the Kowai River. Though Leithfield has the second largest and second fastest growing population (2385 at the 2006 census) in the Hurunui District, its regional importance is behind that of Amberley with its wine industry and the tourist center of Hanmer Springs. This is due in large part to its proximity to the district center at Amberley. Despite this proximity, the Leithfield community supports a school, library, summer swimming pool, and many small businesses.  History  Leithfield was founded in 1857 by John Leith. He purchased a windmill in 1862 and brought it from Christchurch to Leithfield in order to mill wheat. The mill building was 23 meters tall and each sail was 12 meters long making it the tallest building in Canterbury at the time. Unfortunately the Canterbury nor 'westerly winds damaged the mill building making it inoperable. In 1880, Leithfield was a town of 700 people. It had three churches, a police station, a court, a school, three hotels and five shops.

Its name translates to \\"Muddy Water\\", wai meaning water and para meaning mud. It is at the junction of state highways 1 and 7, 60 kilometres north of Christchurch. Hanmer Springs is 76 kilometres (55 minutes drive) north of Waipara. It is also situated on the Main North Line railway. Waipara lies at one of the points of the Alpine Pacific Triangle, which also includes the major tourist centers of Hanmer Springs and Kaikoura. Glenmark Train Station The Weka Pass Railway has its base in Waipara, and runs on 12 kilometres of track between there and Waikari over the former route of the Waiau Branch, a branch line railway that diverged from the Main North Line and ran to Waiau. The Glenmark station is based in Waipara. The Glenmark church has closed down. It was damaged during the 2010 Christchurch earthquakes. The Waipara Hotel burnt down in 2014. It was not insured at the time and has not been replaced. The Waipara region has a reputation as a premium area for the production of Pinot noir, Riesling and Chardonnay. Waipara is sheltered by the Teviot hills from the prevailing cool easterly winds and has the highest summer temperatures and the lowest rainfall of any of the New Zealand wine regions. Because of this, Waipara has over 26 wineries and 80 vineyards within the valley, which collectively produce around 100,000 cases of award-winning wine in an average year. Many of the vineyards offer tastings at their cellar doors and some also have restaurants attached. There are a number of day walks close in Waipara including Tiromoana Bush Walkway and the Mt Cass Walkway which is closed during lambing season. Waipara would have been once been covered in totara, lacebark, kowhai, lancewood and broadleaf forest. It is now predominantly vineyards. There have been a number of ongoing projects to increase the biodiversity of the area. Work is ongoing to plant native species in Waipara's shelter belts, stream boundaries, pond edges and vineyard borders. These have provided benefits in pollination, pest control and weed suppression. It has worked so well that the plantings have resulted in a drop in the use of pesticides in the vineyards. The Waipara Environmental Trapping Association (WETA) is aiming to trap rats and other introduced species with the aim of making Waipara a predator-free paradise for native birds.  Fossils  Waipara is also known for some of the fossils discovered there including the Waipara penguin which is the second oldest penguin fossil to be found, a 62 miilion year old seabird Protodontopteryx ruthae and the Waipara turtle which is estimated to grow to 3 meters long and weigh around 600 kg, The first example of the extinct Haast's Eagle was found on Glenmark Station near Waipara in 1871. Education Waipara School, established 1917. Waipara School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of as of . Waipara School was established in 1917.  Sports  Waipara and Omihi are the catchment area to the Glenmark Rugby Club. The Glenmark rugby club rooms burnt down in 2015. There have been ten All Blacks who have played for Glenmark over the years including Todd Blackadder, Robbie Deans, Bruce Deans, Craig Green, and Andy Earl. Glenmark has had success in the North Canterbury Rugby Competition winning the title in 2016 by beating the Ashley Rugby Club. The Waipara Classic cycle race starts and finishes in Waipara. It has varied in length between 61 km and 90 km over the years.  Notable residents  George Henry Moore was the owner of Glenmark Station just to the north of Waipara. At one stage there were 90,000 sheep and was the most valuable farm in New Zealand.

Biography Before a Country Palace Van de Venne was born in Delft. According to Houbraken he learned Latin in Leiden. He learned to paint from the master goldsmith and painter Simon de Valk, and afterwards learned engraving from Jeronimus van Diest, a good painter of grisailles.Cornelis de Bie, Het Gulden Cabinet 1661, p 235 Adriaan van de Venne biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature He then moved to Middelburg in 1614 where he was influenced by Jan Brueghel the Elder and Pieter Brueghel the Elder. His political painting Fishing for Souls, 1614, is an ironic commentary on the Catholic and Protestant troubles of the Eighty Years War that split the border between the Northern from the Southern Netherlands along the Schelde river, very close to his home in Middleburg. When he painted this picture, the Twelve Years' Truce was in effect since 1609. The influence of Jan Brueghel the Elder is particularly evident in this allegory of religious fanaticism.Noted, for instance, by Martin Royalton- Kisch, reviewing Adriaen Pietersz.

From 1620 until his death van de Venne made many grisailles and engravings of genre subjects, featuring peasants, beggars, thieves and fools as illustrations of current proverbs and sayings, mostly by Jacob Cats.Noted in the preface by K. Porteman to Annelies Plokker, Adriaen Pietersz. Van de Venne (1589-1662), de grisailles met spreukbanden (1984). This work made him famous during his lifetime, and remained popular throughout the 18th century after his death. Van de Venne also worked as a book illustrator and print designer. Van de Venne moved to The Hague and joined the Guild of Saint Luke in 1625, taking the position of dean in 1637. He was a founding member of Confrerie Pictura, a group bent on improving the independent status and social position of the artist in Dutch society by encouraging a more academic approach to the arts.

He was born in Oahu, Hawaii, and his work addresses stereotypes of Asian Americans, such as the model minority concept.Aguirre, Adalberto. (2003). Racial and Ethnic Diversity in America: A Reference Handbook, p. 125. Early life Ronald Takaki was raised in a low- income area of Oahu, Hawaii. He was the descendant of Japanese immigrants who worked on the sugarcane plantations. He was raised by his mother and Chinese stepfather following his father's death at age seven. As a young boy, Takaki cared more for surfing than academics, earning the nickname \\"10-toes Takaki.\\" During high school a Japanese American teacher, Rev. Shunji Nishi Ph.D encouraged him to pursue college and wrote him a letter of recommendation for the College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio. His undergraduate experiences there caused him to begin asking the kinds of questions which evolved into the foundation of his career. As one of only two Asian Americans on campus, he gained a new awareness of his ethnic identity. He was awarded a bachelor's degree in history in 1961.University of Richmond: Takaki bio notes. His graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley led to a master's degree in 1962 and a Ph.D in American history in 1967. His dissertation was on the subject of American slavery, focusing on the rationale for slavery.Ravitz, Jessica. \\"How '10-toes' Takaki Changed U.S. History,\\" CNN. June 6, 2009.

July 22, 2009 Takaki's personal experiences inspired him to devote his life to working for equality for Asian Americans and others. A seminal event in his life developed when his wife's family refused to accept him because they could only see him as a \\"jap\\"‚Äînot as a native-born American citizen just like any one else. Academic career His initial teaching experience was at the University of California at Los Angeles, where he taught the first Black History course offered at that institution. When recalling his first day teaching this course, he stated, \\"When I walked into the classroom I discovered it was held in a huge auditorium - 500 seats and every seat was taken, and students were sitting in the aisles, and there was a loud chitter-chatter, the students were excited...As I made my way to the front of the auditorium all of a sudden a silence descended in this room and their eyes were riveted on me and I could just feel them saying to themselves, 'Funny, he doesn't look black'.\\" One of his students on the first day asked what the class was going to learn about \\"revolutionary tactics,\\" and he later recalled that his immediate response was to suggest that he hoped students would learn skills of critical thinking and effective writing‚Äîand that these could be quite revolutionary. In 1972, he accepted a teaching position at Berkeley where his general survey course, \\"Racial Inequality in America: a Comparative Perspective,\\" led the development of an undergraduate ethnic studies major and an ethnic studies Ph.D. program. For the next three decades, he continued to be an important contributor in the growth of the program. He was involved in developing the school's multicultural requirement for graduation: the American Cultures Requirement.Hyman, Carol. \\"UC Berkeley Professor Ronald Takaki wins Fred Cody Award for lifetime literary achievement, service to community.\\" UC Berkeley Press Release.

Biography E. Martin Hennings was born in Penns Grove, New Jersey on February 5, 1886 to German immigrant parents. Two years after he was born, Hennings' father moved his family to Chicago. Looking back on his early exposure to art and his decision to pursue a life as an artist, Hennings remarked; \\"It was rather strange that I chose painting for my profession, for practically none of my family showed any artistic tendencies. It happened that when I was 12 or 13 years old, another lad and myself wandered into the Art Institute of Chicago and it was during that visit that I determined to become an artist. That day I secured a pamphlet that showed me that art could be studied. That had never occurred to me.\\" It was in 1901 that Hennings began taking classes at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, which was largely based on the great European art schools and made particularly emphasis on the importance of drawing. On June 17, 1904, he graduated from the school with honors, but continued to study there for another two years, mostly under the instruction of John Vanderpoel. Hennings eventually took up work as a commercial artist, mostly painting murals and portraits around Chicago. Murals on which Hennings worked, usually on canvas panels, include one for the cafeteria at the Art Institute of Chicago, the Florentine Ballroom at the Congress Plaza Hotel in Chicago, and The Ascension, a mural painted for the Grace Episcopal Cathedral in Topeka, Kansas. Europe Out of a desire to return to fine art painting, he re-enrolled at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and soon entered, in 1912, a painting in a competition at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, for which he won second prize. He soon enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich in Germany, under the direction of Angelo Junk, Walter Thor, and Franz von Stuck, who was particularly influential on the painter. In January 1914, Hennings became a member of the American Artists Club in Munich, Germany with Victor Higgins and Walter Ufer, who would both later become fellow Taos Society of Artists. Before World War I escalated, Hennings relocated back to his hometown of Chicago and initially resided at the Fine Arts Building on Michigan Ave, where Louis Grell joined him for a short period before the two moved studios to the famous Tree Studio artist colony in Chicago's North side. At this time Hennings also joined the artist run Palette and Chisel Academy of Fine Art, and by 1916 had already gained respect in Chicago with a number of awards, including a Gold Medal from the Palette and Chisel Club as well as the Englewood Women's Club prize at the Art Institute of Chicago. New Mexico Hennings soon attracted the attention of a number Chicago businessmen and art patrons, including Carter H. Harrison, Jr. Harrison offered to sponsor a trip for Hennings to visit and paint in Taos, New Mexico, in exchange for the works he completed during his stay. Hennings was not the first to receive such a proposition; Walter Ufer and Victor Higgins had both been approached by Harrison three years earlier, and soon settled permanently in the Southwest. Hennings accepted the patrons proposition and spent the summer and fall of 1917 in and around Taos. Harrison supplied Hennings with an introduction to the newly created New Mexico Museum of Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico. For the inaugural exhibition at the museum Hennings exhibited three paintings. In that year, 1917, Hennings exhibited his first painting in the United States, outside of Chicago, at the National Academy of Design in New York City, New York. Although Hennings soon traveled back to Chicago to continue his work as a commercial artist, three years later he moved permanently to Taos. His new home allowed Hennings to expand past the limitations of commercial art, to paint freely. In particularly the artist was able to freely travel around the area surrounding Taos, painting en plein air subjects of intense natural beauty in remarkable light, none of which would have been possible in Chicago. In part due to his academic education, Hennings' primary interest was in portrait painting, with his primary subject being the Native Americans living in and around Taos Pueblo. While continuing to paint predominantly in the Southwest, Hennings frequently exhibited in Chicago. In 1922 he was awarded the Clyde M. Carr Prize from the Art Institute of Chicago as well as the Institute's Fine Arts Building Prize. The following year his success in his hometown continued with the Martin B. Cahn Prize, again from the Art Institute of Chicago, for his painting The Twins. Taos Society of Artists Such accolades contributed to Hennings' reputation and, also in 1923, the painter was nominated by Oscar E. Berninghaus and Walter Ufer for membership in the Taos Society of Artists. However, he was not elected a member that year, but was re-nominated the following year and, this time, received a unanimous vote. Catharine Carter Critcher was accepted for membership at the same meeting. During one trip back to Illinois, in 1924, Hennings met Helen Otte, an employee at the Chicago department store Marshall Field. The two were married just two years later, on July 20, 1926, and travelled extensively through Europe for 16 months for their honeymoon, visiting Italy, France, Spain, and Morocco. In the years before he was married, Hennings completed his first prints, eight lithographs of various Southwestern subjects. The prints were made on zinc plates and printed in Chicago. Six of the lithographs; Across the Sage, The Frozen Stream, Through Sage and Cedar, Indian Bake Ovens, Beneath the Cottonwoods, and The Hunters, were first printed in an edition of 50, and later in a second edition of 100. The prints Taos Indian and Indian Maiden were produced in a more limited number. Hennings only completed one other print project, which consisted of four monotypes. Feeling that the organization had run its course and achieved its purposed, the Taos Society of Artists disbanded in 1927. It had grown to include some of the nation's most accomplished painters, including Joseph Henry Sharp, Ernest Blumenschein, Bert G. Phillips, Oscar E. Berninghaus, E. Irving Couse, W. Herbert Dunton, Walter Ufer, Victor Higgins, and Kenneth Miller Adams. Mature career E. Martin Hennings, Homeward Bound, 1933-1934, oil on canvas, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Transfer from the U.S. Department of Labor, 1964.1.62SAAM-1964.1.62 1 By the 1920s, the now established painter was building his reputation on the national scene, with exhibitions and awards including; the Walter Lippincott Prize at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts (1925), the lsidor Medal and the Ranger Fund Purchase prizes at the National Academy of Design in New York (1926), the Harry Frank Prize from the Art Institute of Chicago (1927), exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery of Art (1928 and 1933), and won first prize at the 1929 Texas Wildflower Competition. Hennings's success was not limited to the United States, however, and he was included in the 1924 Venice Biennale, the International Exhibition in Paris in 1926, and the 1927 Paris Salon. Many art collectors throughout America sought out his paintings. Such private patrons included Carter H. Harrison, Jr., Oscar F. Mayer, Robert McKee, and Lutcher Stark. Hennings also received support from the Public Works of Art Project and the Section of Painting and Sculpture, which commissioned the mural The Chosen Site in a Van Buren, Arkansas, post office. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad also broadly supported his work, including commissioning specific works for advertisements, and remained a supporter of Hennings throughout his career. Death and legacy E. Martin Hennings died May 19, 1956. Hennings was buried in his hometown of Chicago, rather than his adopted town of Taos, New Mexico. Today paintings by Hennings are housed in the following museums; the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Stark Museum of Art, Booth Western Art Museum, C.M. Russell Museum, Denver Art Museum, Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art, Gilcrease Museum, New Mexico Museum of Art, National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum, Rockwell Museum, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, National Museum of Wildlife Art, and Woolaroc Museum. The E. Martin Hennings House and Studio Historic District in Taos is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Martin also played guitar with the groups EZ-Street, Vicious Hatred, Agents of Misfortune, Recluse, and Pigs of Death. Martin was known for his long hair, bushy beard, and trademark red-rimmed glasses that he wears alone or over another darker pair of glasses. Early career In the early '80s Martin was playing guitar in thrash band Vicious Hatred. During the 80s he was an on-off member of the jamming band Spastik Children, also featuring schoolmate and close friend Cliff Burton, and other members of Metallica.  Faith No More  Martin joined Faith No More in 1983, four years after the group's formation. He played on their albums We Care a Lot, Introduce Yourself, their breakthrough album The Real Thing with new vocalist Mike Patton replacing Chuck Mosley, and Angel Dust. Following the release of Angel Dust, Martin left the group for reasons that remain unknown. On his now- defunct website, Martin stated The Real Thing was FNM's ideal album, both in the creative process and the touring afterward. The musical about-face that the band took with Angel Dust, including the change in focus from guitars to vocals, did not sit well with Martin. The extent to which Martin did or did not contribute to songwriting and recording on Angel Dust is a subject that the band for years never directly addressed, except to recognize his major influence on the track \\"Jizzlobber.\\" In an October 2016 PopMatters interview with Faith No More bassist Billy Gould, Gould addressed directly the controversy about whether studio musicians or Martin played on Angel Dust: > Gould sets the record straight. \\"No studio musicians. He played, but the > writing process was extremely difficult because he wasn't really much of a > fan of the music. He wasn't really behind it. He wasn‚Äôt really into it. So > it was a tough process. I mean, I think, really, we realized that he wasn‚Äôt > going to continue while we were making that record because he was just on a > different musical page.\\" The dynamic the band was in was similar to that > which led to Mosley's termination. \\"It could not have continued the way it > did,\\" Gould says seriously. The band fired Martin by fax on November 30, 1993, after the band had not progressed as they would have liked in rehearsals and songwriting. As an indication of the gulf that had formed between Martin and the rest of the band, they had recorded and released \\"Another Body Murdered\\" (with Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E. for the Judgment Night soundtrack) without his participation. Similarly, Martin produced and recorded material for the film Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey movie without the participation of other members of the band. Producer Matt Wallace later mentioned in The Real Story (a biographical book about Faith No More) that the death of Martin's father was a factor in the guitarist's departure. On February 18, 2009 Roadrunner Records announced that Martin would not be participating in the rumored Faith No More reunion tour. On February 23, 2009, it was announced as part of a press release by Mike Patton that Faith No More would be reuniting for a string of European tour dates. On February 25, shortly after Patton's press release, Bill Gould announced a Faith No More reunion tour and identified the line-up, which excluded Martin. On July 16, 2010, Sirius XM Liquid Metal DJ Troy Hinson, reported that while he was backstage at Faith No More's Philadelphia appearance, Patton told him that Jim Martin was offered a chance to play with the band at one of their three San Francisco reunion tour dates in order to play the album Angel Dust in its entirety, but he declined. Solo career Martin's solo project was originally called The Behemoth but he changed the moniker after finding out about a Polish death metal band already named Behemoth. His first and only solo album to date is entitled Milk and Blood, on which he covers his former band's song \\"Surprise! You're Dead\\", from The Real Thing. Martin toured as lead guitarist with punk band Fang between 1998 and 2000. He now lives in Castro Valley, California, with his wife, son, and daughter. He has gained fame in recent years for his non-musical endeavors in championship pumpkin growing. In 2011, Martin joined Metallica on stage with Gary Rossington, Pepper Keenan, and Jerry Cantrell to play \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" as part of Metallica's 30th anniversary shows. In 2013, he played guitar in the Infectious Grooves reunion at Orion Music + More festival at Belle Isle in Detroit, Michigan. In 2014, he once again joined Infectious Grooves on stage to celebrate the 50 year anniversary of the Whisky a Go Go. In November 2019 he returned to play with Infectious Grooves at the first Sick Bastards Festival organized by Mike Muir in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Film appearance In 1991 he appeared in Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey as \\"Sir James Martin, head of the Faith No More Spiritual and Theological Center\\" in the future.

It lies to the south of the larger town, separated from it by the Ashburton River. The town was named after Tinwald Downs in Scotland, birthplace of an early european resident and owner of much of the land, Robert Wilkin.Wises Publications Limited, Discover New Zealand - A Wises Guide, 9th edition, 1994, p 415. Prominent former citizens of Tinwald include William Massey, who was Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1912 to 1925. The Main South Line section of the South Island Main Trunk Railway runs through Tinwald, and from 1878 until 1968, the town acted as the junction for the Mount Somers Branch. The first 2.5 kilometres of the branch line at the Tinwald end are now preserved by The Plains Vintage Railway & Historical Museum, who regularly operate public open days. The Railway is particularly notable for K 88, a locomotive recovered in 19 and 20 January 1974 from where it was dumped in the Oreti River and returned to full operating condition in 1982. It still operates services on The Plains Railway today. Tinwald has several shops spanning its main road including several caf√©s, a tavern, a supermarket and its own liquor store.

The objective of change management in this context is to ensure that standardized methods and procedures are used for efficient and prompt handling of all changes to control IT infrastructure, in order to minimize the number and impact of any related incidents upon service. Changes in the IT infrastructure may arise reactively in response to problems or externally imposed requirements, e.g. legislative changes, or proactively from seeking improved efficiency and effectiveness or to enable or reflect business initiatives, or from programs, projects or service improvement initiatives. Change management can ensure standardized methods, processes and procedures which are used for all changes, facilitate efficient and prompt handling of all changes, and maintain the proper balance between the need for change and the potential detrimental impact of changes. Information Technology Infrastructure Library  Change management within ITSM (as opposed to software engineering or project management) is often associated with ITIL, but the origins of change as an IT management process predate ITIL considerably, at least according to the IBM publication A Management System for the Information Business. In the ITIL framework, change management is a part of \\"Service Transition\\" ‚Äì transitioning something newly developed (i.e. an update to an existing production environment or deploying something entirely new) from the Service Design phase into Service Operation (also known as Business As Usual) and aims to ensure that standardised methods and procedures are used for efficient handling of all changes. Change management is a process used for managing the planned deployment of alterations to all configuration items in the configuration management database (or \\"CIs\\" in the CMDB), that are a part of a business's live (\\"production\\") and test (\\"UAT\\") environments along with any other environment that a business wants to have under change management ‚Äì generally all environments that are under the control of 'ICT Operations'. It is not typically responsible for change within development environments (see below). A change is an event that is: * approved by management * implemented with a minimised and accepted risk to existing IT infrastructure * results in a new status of one or more configuration items (CIs) * provides increased value to the business (increased revenue, avoided cost, or improved service) from the use of the new or enhanced IT systems. In development projects ITSM change management is not typically responsible for overseeing changes that occur within deployment or development projects which are typically delegated to a change management process dictated by the project management methodology adopted for the project. However, close liaison between development project managers and the Change Manager is expected and the project manager may be required to utilize change management for items within the production or test environments that are required for testing or release. Process overview Change management would typically be composed of the raising and recording of changes, assessing the impact, cost, benefit and risk of proposed changes, developing business justification and obtaining approval, managing and coordinating change implementation, monitoring and reporting on implementation, reviewing and closing change requests. ITIL defines the change management process this way: :The goal of the change management process is to ensure that standardized methods and procedures are used for efficient and prompt handling of all changes, in order to minimize the impact of change- related incidents upon service quality, and consequently improve the day-to- day operations of the organization. ISO 20000 defines the objective of change management (part 1, 9.2) as: :To ensure all changes are assessed, approved, implemented and reviewed in a controlled manner. Change management is responsible for managing change process involving: *Hardware *Communications equipment and software *System software *All documentation and procedures associated with the running, support and maintenance of live systems. Any proposed change must be approved in the change management process. While change management makes the process happen, the decision authority is the Change Advisory Board (CAB), which generally is composed of people from other functions within the organization. The main activities of the change management are: * Filtering changes * Managing changes and the change process * Chairing the TAB (Technical Advisory Board) and technical assessment of changes * Chairing the CAB and the CAB/Emergency committee * Reviewing and closing of Requests for Change (RFCs) * Management reporting and providing management information Definitions The ITIL concept of change management includes developing business justification. This is a broadening of scope from other concepts of change management, and overlaps into the concerns of IT portfolio management and those areas covered by the initiation phases within programme management and project management. For example, the IBM \\"Yellow Book\\" conception of change control (as a subset of resource control) was strictly concerned with the transfer of deliverables from projects into production. Similarly, Schiesser in IT Systems Management defines Change Management as \\"a process to control and coordinate all changes to an IT production environment.\\" Schiesser, Rick, 2002.

The tender is for 57 rakes consisting of 171 cars which will delivered phase wise at least 9 months before the commencement of each stage. On 22 May 2014 the first train had arrived at Uppal depot in Hyderabad. On 31 December 2014, Hyderabad Metro created a new technology record by successfully running a train in Automatic Train Operation (ATO) mode for the first time on Indian soil between Nagole and Mettuguda. = Istanbul Marmaray = Metrolink Rotem cab car Hyundai Rotem announced on November 11, 2008, that it had signed a ‚Ç¨580m contract to supply the rolling stock for the Marmaray cross-Bosporus tunnel project in Istanbul. The Korean firm saw off competition from short-listed bidders Alstom, CAF and a consortium of Bombardier, Siemens and Nurol for the 440-vehicle contract which was placed by the Ministry of Transport's General Directorate of Railways, Harbours & Airports. The 22 m long stainless steel cars will be formed into 10 and five-car EMUs. Some production will be carried out locally by Eurotem, Hyundai Rotem's joint venture with Turkish rolling stock manufacturer T√úVASA≈û. The cars will arrive in three batches, the first 160 cars by 2011, the last by June 2014. Hyundai Rotem won its first contract in Turkey in 1996, and has now completed seven orders for a total of 804 vehicles worth US$1¬∑6bn. In July it signed a contract to provide 84 DMUs in conjunction with T√ºvasas. 'Hyundai Rotem has earned the trust of Turkey by providing high quality products and technology', said Executive Vice-Chairman Yeo-Sung Lee. 'We believe this brightens the outlook for future business opportunities in Turkey such as the Istanbul line and the Ankara line.' = Boston MBTA = Hyundai Rotem was awarded a contract with Boston's MBTA in early 2008 for the construction of 75 cars. The contract entails the delivery of the first 4 cars by October 2010 while the remaining 71 cars were scheduled to be delivered by the end of 2012. However, due to chronic delays, shoddy workmanship, material shortage, and the death of Hyundai Rotem's chief executive, M.H. Lee, in November 2012, only four cars have been delivered by the end of 2012. On December 21, 2012, the MBTA sent a letter to Hyundai Rotem threatening to cancel the contract if a solution is not soon reached, which, would be a breach of the contract terms. Since then, the new cars have continued to experience various mechanical problems resulting in car shortages and delays.

It is not as large as its neighbour, the Tasman Glacier, measuring 11 kilometres (roughly 6‚Äì7 miles) in length. Etymology The geographic Hooker items were named by the Canterbury provincial geologist, Julius von Haast, after the English botanist William Jackson Hooker. Description The glacier starts on the south-western slopes of Aoraki / Mount Cook, with its tributaries Sheila Glacier, Empress Glacier, and Noeline Glacier. Hooker Glacier runs south from there until its terminus at Hooker Lake. The glacial water from the lake is the source of the Hooker River, a small tributary of the Tasman River, which flows into Lake Pukaki. Hooker Glacier in winter, behind frozen Hooker Lake One of New Zealand's more accessible glaciers, the glacier and its terminus can be seen clearly from the end of the Hooker Valley Track. This easy walk to the glacier lake is the most popular in the region. For serious trampers and mountaineers, there are three huts along the glacier further up the valley: Hooker Hut, Gardiner Hut, and Empress Hut. The current glacier lake only started to form in the 1970s, left behind as Hooker Glacier retreated. Like many of the glaciers in the Southern Alps, Hooker Glacier is rapidly melting, with the glacier lake projected to grow as the terminus retreats until it reaches the glacier bed about 4 kilometres upstream from the current terminus.

The town is located on Bor√∞oy, which is one of the northernmost islands (the Nor√∞oyar). It is the administrative centre of Klaksv√≠k municipality. History Turf-roofed house in Klaksvik The first settlement at Klaksv√≠k dates back to Viking times, but it was not until the 20th century that the district merged to form a large, modern Faroese town that became a cultural and commercial centre for the Northern Isles and the Faroe Islands as a whole. Klaksv√≠k is located between two inlets lying back to back. It has an important harbour with fishing industry and a modern fishing fleet. Originally, four farms were located where Klaksv√≠k is now. In time, they grew into four villages: V√°gur, Myrkjanoyri, Ger√∞ar and Uppsalir; which finally merged to form the town of Klaksv√≠k in 1938. What triggered the development of the town was the establishment of a centralized store for all the northern islands on the location. The brewery F√∂roya Bj√≥r in Klaksv√≠k is a Faroese family brewery, founded in 1888. The ram has been the symbol of the brewery since the early beginning. Since August 2007, when Restorffs Bryggjar√≠ went out of business, F√∂roya Bj√≥r has been the only producer of beer and soft drinks in the Faroe Islands. With the opening of the Leirv√≠k sub-sea tunnel, the Nor√∞oyatunnilin in April 2006, Klaksv√≠k gained a physical link with the mainland of the Faroe Islands and can now be considered one of its key ports. Several developments are under way to exploit this symbiosis, including a new industrial park located by the tunnel entrance. Klaksv√≠k is home to Summarfestivalurin.  The Christianschurch  Christianskirkjan, built in 1963, is the first one in modern times in Scandinavia to be built in Norse style. The roof construction is the same as that found in the Viking halls, and which has survived in Faroese smoke rooms (kitchens) and village churches. This open roof construction has proved to be especially suitable for church buildings, as the acoustics in this church are better than in others of a similar size. The church is dedicated to the memory of the sailors who lost their lives during World War II. Hanging from the ceiling is an old 8-man rowing-boat, from Vi√∞arei√∞i, it was used to transport the priest between villages.  Transport  Klaksv√≠k used to be an isolated town until 2006 when the Nor√∞oyatunnilin opened. A frequent bus service now links the town to T√≥rshavn, while smaller services operate to Fuglafj√∏r√∞ur, Kunoy and Vi√∞arei√∞i. Also it has remained the ferry port for Kalsoy. Since 2014, a city bus (Busslei√∞in) connects the outlying parts with the city center, and taxis offer additional services. The bus services and the ferry to Kalsoy are operated by Strandfaraskip Landsins, the public transport company of the Faroe Islands. There is a helipad which mainly has flights to isolated islands like Fugloy and Sv√≠noy, as well as to T√≥rshavn. Twin towns - Sister cities Klaksvik is twinned with: * - Sisimiut, Greenland * - K√≥pavogur, Iceland * - Trondheim, Norway * - Norrk√∂ping, Sweden * - Tampere, Finland * - Odense, Denmark * - Taiji, Japan since 2018 * - Wick, Caithness, Scotland. For twenty years the town was twinned with Wick. In August 2015, Wick councillors threatened to break these ties on account of a Faroese long standing practice which involves hunting and eating migrating pilot whales. As of January 2016 the decision has been postponed. Sports These are some of the sporting associations in Klaksv√≠k: The local football club is K√ç. The local gymnastics club is Klaksv√≠kar Fimleikafelag. In handball there are two clubs, one for men and another for women. The women's handball club is Stj√∏rnan. The men's handball club is Team Klaksv√≠k.

Together with Fro√∞ba, Trongisv√°gur, L√≠√∞in and √òrav√≠k it forms Tv√∏royri Municipality. The village is considered to have been founded in 1836, when the Royal Danish Monopoly Trade Store was founded on a small tongue of land, called Tv√∏royri. In a short span of years, Tv√∏royri grew into a large village, mainly after 1856 when the monopoly state of the store was abolished. Around the turn of the 20th century, Tv√∏royri was one of the largest towns on the Faroe Islands and had one of the main fishing industries. Overview The church in Tv√∏royri was constructed in Norway as a building set, moved to Tv√∏royri and then built here in 1907, ready to use in 1908. The old church was moved to Sandv√≠k.Folkakirkjan.fo = Trongisv√°gur = Trongisv√°gur is the village furthest to the west of the inlet of Trongisv√°gsfj√∏r√∞ur. Trongisv√°gur is where most of the new residential houses have been built. Trongisv√°gur is home to the large Sports Centre, the children's institutions and the football stadium \\"St√≥r√°\\". St√≥r√° is the home of TB ‚Äì Tv√∏royrar B√≥ltfelag, the oldest football team of the Faroe Islands. TB was founded in 1892; the second oldest team was founded in 1904. = Fro√∞ba = The other neighbouring village is called Fro√∞ba. It is further east on the north side of the fjord, on the same side as Tv√∏royri. Fro√∞ba has columnar basalt along the road. The poet Poul F. Joensen had his home in Fro√∞ba ‚Äì there is a monument there to honour him. Fro√∞ba and Trongisv√°gur are older villages than Tv√∏royri.  History  When the monopoly was abolished in 1856, private companies were founded on Tv√∏royri. One of these grew into the largest in the Faroe Islands. It had 20 branches and 30 ships. Down by the harbour, north of Segllofti√∞, lies a square covered by flat stones. Fish used to be dried in the sun here. The Royal Trade Monopoly that had a branch here from 1836 to 1856 built the old houses in the area. The village of Tv√∏royri was actually founded due to this branch. Tv√∏royri has a large fillet-factory that initiated its production in 1975.  Transport  The ferry Smyril M/F has 2-3 daily departures from T√≥rshavn, it calls at Krambatangi ferry port, which is located on the opposite side of the inlet. The trip from T√≥rshavn to Tv√∏royri takes 2 hours. The ferry takes 200 cars and 975 persons. There are two bus lines in Su√∞uroy, line 700 goes to the southern part of the island with Sumba as its end station, 701 goes to the northern part of the island, the end stations are in Sandv√≠k, the northernmost village, and in F√°mjin, which is on the west coast.  Culture  Tv√∏royri and V√°gur take turns in hosting an annual civic-festival called J√≥ans√∏ka. It can be described as a smaller version of the √ìlavs√∏ka held in T√≥rshavn. J√≥ans√∏ka runs in late June. Tv√∏royri has a history and maritime museum and an art gallery. =Sports= The sports club TB Tv√∏royri was founded in 1892 as a football club, the first in the Faroe Islands. The name TB is also used in volleyball. The club was a branch of TB Tv√∏royri, but in 2016 it became an independent club with the name TB Flogb√≥ltur. In December 2016 the three football clubs on the island of Su√∞uroy, TB, FC Su√∞uroy and Royn, agreed to merge into one club. The new club will get a new name for the 2018 season, for the 2017 season the name was TB/FC Su√∞uroy/Royn. There is a rowing club, Fro√∞biar S√≥knar R√≥√∞rarfelag, which was founded in 1934.

The village is located on the south-west coast of Streymoy and has a view towards the islands of Hestur and Koltur towards the west and to Sandoy towards the south. The village is the Faroes' most important historical site, with the ruins of the Magnus Cathedral from around 1300, Saint Olav's Church (Olavskirkjan), from the 12th century and the old farmhouse of Kirkjub√∏argar√∞ur from the 11th century. In 1832, a runestone was found near the Magnus Cathedral in Kirkjub√∏ur. The stone which is referred to as the Kirkjub√∏ur stone dates back to the Viking Age. The little islet just of the coast, Kirkjub√∏h√≥lmur, contains an eiderduck colony. To the village belongs the islet of Tr√∏llh√∏vdi, just 100m off the northern tip of Sandoy 9 km away from Kirkjub√∏ur. It was given as payment to the villagers as it was their duty to ferry people across to Sandoy in medieval times. History The village was important in the Middle Ages. At that time it was the episcopal residence for the Diocese of the Faroe Islands and as such the spiritual centre of the society. In those days the village is said to have had around 50 houses. The majority of these houses were washed away by a fierce storm in the 16th century, which created the islet Kirkjub√∏h√≥lmurin, which contains ruins from that time.

The muixeranga is much more than an artistic acrobatic dance. It is a collection of ancient human choreographies of enormous plasticity illustrating various figures and shapes, which are held during the Algemes√≠ town festival (September 7 and 8th), in honor of the Virgin of Health (Mare de D√©u de la Salut). The Muixeranga resembles the modern castellers in many ways, the latter being spread all over Catalonia. Both traditions share the same origin, the \\"Moixiganga\\", (a series of dances of human towers) once found throughout the Iberian Peninsula. Muixeranga differs from castellers mainly in that the Muixeranga has a religious background and is accompanied by a traditional dance, it is also focused in the height of the human towers, but focuses also in the complexity and technique in order to create a plastic, figurative scene. Logo of intangible cultural heritage, UNESCO La Mare de D√©u de la Salut Festival The feast day of Our Lady of Health, patroness of Algemesi is September 8, and commemorates the legendary discovery in 1247 of a statue depicting the Madonna and Child. The image venerated in the town since the mid-twentieth century is a replica, because during the Civil War the original image of the Virgin of Health was destroyed, as was the chapel. The festival appears to have originated in a street party in the area of the Chapel of Finding and gradually spread to other neighborhoods. The main celebration in held on 7 and 8 September, is preceded by a novena at the Chapel of the Finding, which begins August 29 and ends on September 6. The festival has preserved traditional dances and music, and has served as a source for the recovery of dances that formally existed in other locations and have been able to be re-established. Festivity of 'la Mare de D√©u de la Salut' of Algemes√≠. The involvement of the town's inhabitants is the foundation upon which the continuity of this celebration is based. Each ritual works and has been prepared independently since the 18th Century. From the ‚ÄúMuixeranga‚Äù through to each of the dances, the different variations and musical scores have been passed from generation to generation. In the early 18th Century the dances belonged to different guilds; for example, the ‚ÄúMuixeranga‚Äù was the domain of construction workers, the ‚ÄúCarxofa‚Äù of the weavers, and so on. But social changes brought modifications to this custom and the traditions opened up to include people from other professional sectors. UNESCO has recognized the ritual, festive and community participation dimension of the Valencian celebration Our Lady of Health as part of the \\"intangible heritage of humanity\\".\\"Unesco declares Algemes√≠ Muixeranga intangible heritage of humanity\\", el Peri√≥dico, 28 November 2011 The Festivity of ‚Äúla Mare de D√©u de la Salut‚Äù has been studied by ethno-anthropologists, sociologists and historians. It has inspired artists, musicians and poets. All of these people have remarked on the breadth of the cultural content of this event. Artistic groups such as the ‚ÄúMuixeranga‚Äù; dances like ‚Äúels Bastonets‚Äù or ‚Äúels Tornejants‚Äù; or the music that accompanies the performances are all the result of having conserved a fundamental part of the cultural heritage of an entire town. It was this popularity and interest in the tradition that led to the creation in 2002, of the Museu Valenci√† de la Festa (a Museum dedicated to the Festivity); which offers exhibitions and research into the Festivity. At the centre, visitors can learn about the history, the ritual acts, the dances, the music and the costumes of the celebration, as well as enjoying many stories from the event.  Origin and evolution  There are several theories on the origin of muixeranga, especially in relation to its name. The first theory advocates that the word comes from the Arabic word mochain, meaning \\"mask\\". A second theory links it with ancient processions held on the streets to commemorate some special event. Even though the tradition in the Iberian Peninsula may date back to the 13th century, the first written record of the muixeranga in Algemes√≠ can be traced to the first third of the 18th century. However, its constant, strong presence suggests a much older origin. The first solemn celebrations of the Virgin of Health happened in 1724, so this is the earliest that the muixeranga could be linked to this celebration. However, the first concrete date comes from the town account book in the year 1733, when the dulzaina players employed in the festival were given an annual stipend. The guilds were the real driving force behind the event, and in changing times, they died out. The Muixeranga began to wane and by 1973 it had almost disappeared altogether. A group including writer Mart√≠ Dom√≠nguez i Barber√†, Mayor Manuel Rico, Vicent Raga, festival organiser in the Capella neighbourhood, and Father Vicent Castell Maiques, with the support of the students‚Äô association Associaci√≥ d'Antics Alumnes dels Maristes, were responsible for re-launching it under the guidance of Tom√†s Pla. A year later the Friends of assossiaci√≥ Muixeranga was founded.\\"Muixeranga\\", Museo Valencia de la Festa Eloi Miralles, a member of the Colla de Castellers de Vilafranca del Pened√®s, arranged for the muixeranguers to visit the Pened√®s capital and on August 31, 1978, the Muixeranga rose up in Villafranca's main square, banishing forever that lack of visibility which might have proved fatal. Muixeranga in front of church Sant Jaume d'Algemes√≠. Processions =The Promeses Process√≥= At nightfall on 7 September, the beginning of the festivities is signaled by the ringing of the bells of the Basilica of St. James the Apostle. When the ringing stops and silence descends, the first notes of the flutes are sounded and the first of the processions begins. The procession, which begins with the mysteries and martyrdoms, (short theatrical pieces, performed by groups of children), has a scrupulous order with the towers of the Muixeranga second, followed by the Bastonets, the Carxofa, the Arquets, the Pastoretes, Bolero or llauradores. =Processoneta of Mati= On the morning of September 8, there is a second, shorter procession known as the Processoneta of Mati. =The Volta Great= The procession called the Volta Great, starts about 4:00 p.m. and is the longest, lasting over seven hours. Starting from the Basilica of St. James, the traditional dances of Algemes√≠ and the image of the patron pass back through the old city, repeating the original itinerary of 1724.  Characteristics  After the mysteries and martyrdoms, all the processions display a series of dances; the Muixerangas leads the rest. The Muixerangas, a set of tableaux composed of human towers and representative figures, has several stages, and opens with all muixerangueros dancing in two rows with candles burning. The dance is accompanied by the music of drum and flute. The muixerangueros then form a human tower moving to the sound of the music. The tower is topped by a child with open arms. The forms of the Muixerangas assume plastic or pliable shapes that open or appear to form different figures which have all Marian symbolism. The Valencian town of Algemesi and its Muixeranga, lays claim to being the origin of the castells found throughout Catalonia. muixerangers preparing the elevation of muixeranga tower. The people composing the castles are usually a group of men, of virtually any profession, but preferably of strength and physical skill. Nowadays, around 200 men participate in the plastic figures, but historically there were not more than thirty. There is a master, or conductor, which coordinates the dance and the human castles, towers and other figures, as well as admitting and training new people. The clothes are idiosyncratic in many ways. They are composed of a shirt, trousers, farmer's shoes and sometimes a special hat. The fabric is coloured with vertical red and blue stripes on a white base, like a harlequin. It seems that this strange appearance is unintentional. Older people can still remember that they were once made from old mattress fabric. Accompanying the group, some young members carry some jugs cut in half and painted with stripes with typical colors of the same muixeranga (designed by former member Juan Ezquer in 1973) which serves to collect funds for the activities of Muixeranga.  Music and symbology  The dance is accompanied by the music of tabalet (a drum) and dol√ßaina (valencian shawm), with a very old characteristic tune, of unknown author. Some people striving for the recovery of the Valencian culture and its language, such as Joan Fuster, have suggested the music of the Muixeranga as an anthem for the Valencian Community.Viadel, Francese. \\"The Muixeranga: a Long Journey\\", M√®tode, University of Valencia, 2012  See also  * Acrobalance * Acrobatic gymnastics * Govinda sport, events to celebrate the birth of Krishna * Gymnastic formation * Human pyramid * Castell or Human tower Notes References *Bertran, Jordi: El Ball de Valencians.

They may be employed to control riots as their name suggests, to disperse or control crowds, to maintain public order or discourage criminality, or to protect people or property. In some cases, riot police may function as a tool of political repression by violently breaking up protests and suppressing dissent or civil disobedience.

They are a very well known Goa trance project from Milan Italy. 1993-1998 Max Lanfranconi was a co-producer on an independent Italian label Time Out and had released two singles in the mid-80's. Max was also member of the 'Tribe' group and by 1998 he began organizing 'Dance all Night' parties in Italy. Dance All Night parties became very famous, the first official parties in Italy to last till the morning lights. Encouraged by the success Max decided to start producing and around in 1992 he met Andrea Rizzo and they started to make music together. Meanwhile around the same time Maurizio Begotti and Carlo Paterno had started making music elsewhere. In 1993 they all met a record shop and decided to produce music together and Etnica was born . Andrea had a solid classical music background that combined with the melodies of Carlo and Maurizio's sense of arrangement would soon lead to the production of some of the most classic goa trance tracks. Their first EP was published on Brainstorm Records in 1994, and was entitled \\"The EP\\". Their first album, \\"The Juggeling Alchemists Under The Black Light\\", was out in 1995 on the German label High Society. This helped the band to build a solid reputation in the Psychedelic Trance scene. Their second album, the classic \\"Alien Protein\\", was released in 1996 on Blue Room Released. The band, beside producing music as Etnica, had the idea of creating a party-oriented side project and after some thoughts the name Pleiadians was forged. Starting off with an EP on Symbiosis Records in 1995, they have produced with the original band members two albums, \\"Identified Flying Object\\" (1997) and \\"Family of Light\\" (1999) in which Carlo was partially involved. Their first album, I.F.O., was started by Carlo during August '96 and was then finalized with the other band members in September '96, but released only a year after on Dragonfly Records. They had another side project, Crop Circles, that was a collaboration with another Italian band, Lotus Omega and with that project they released 2 singles, Full Mental Jackpot & Lunar Civilization both released in 1997 on Auracle Recordings and also finalized an album in 1998, \\"Tetrahedron\\" that was finally released only in 2008 on DAT Records. 1998-present In 1998 the band moved its studios to Ibiza where the project would be carried on by Max and Maurizio only. After the writing of their third full-length album Equator (1999), Andrea left the band as well. Since 1999 the band has changed their sound to be up to the modern standards of production, following the worldwide trends and trying to achieve a more mature sound, after successfully proving that they could realize some of the best goa trance tracks ever. Their fourth album, Nitrox (2001) is the result of this evolution and worked really well on the dance-floors at the time of release. The following album, Chrome (2002) displayed a further development in sound production and clarity and was so successful that they released two versions, one for Europe and one for Japan. Their sixth Etnica album Sharp (2004) was liked by old time fans too as it featured a return of melodies, like they did in the past times, but still showed a crystal clear and professional production. In 2006 a seventh album was released, Totemism, featuring all their best hits remixed by the most famous psytrance producers of the millennium. This one was highly acclaimed by fans worldwide. The Pleiadians project was relaunched in 2006 with the release of a third opus, an album called 7even Sister7, that delivered many sci-fi oriented tracks, released on Harmonia Records. Etnica are still very active in the scene and weekly performing DJ and Live sets all around the world.

The founding members are Colin Angus (born 24 August 1961), Derek McKenzie (born 27 February 1964) and Keith McKenzie (born 30 August 1961). Peter Stephenson (born 1 March 1962) joined shortly after to take over on keyboards from Angus. Several other people were later in the band. Angus then teamed up with Will Sinnott, and together they found credibility as pioneers of rock/dance crossover. When Mr. C joined, the band moved on to international commercial success with \\"Ebeneezer Goode\\" and their 1992 Boss Drum album. History =1980s= The Shamen were preceded by Alone Again Or, the Love- inspired name under which they recorded their first psychedelic electronic pop singles. After their name change, further singles picked up airplay from John Peel. Released in June 1987, the Shamen's first album, Drop, demonstrated their love of 1960s psychedelia, with influences such as Love, Syd Barrett and the 13th Floor Elevators. By mid-1987, frontman Colin Angus was discovering the sounds of early house-music pioneers, such as S-Express and M/A/R/R/S, and increasing his knowledge of the latest studio gadgetry. By September 1987, the Shamen were applying these techniques to their own music, mixing rock guitars, techno and hip-hop rhythms and sampled radio voices, which was to prove influential to groups like Jesus Jones and EMF. Their single \\"Christopher Mayhew Says\\", released in late 1987 was their first single to experiment with beat machines and samples, fusing them with their psychedelic rock sound. However, the newfound sound proved too radical for co-founder and vocalist Derek McKenzie, who left the band in late 1987 to study at university. The Shamen were suddenly one crucial player short. Help was at hand from the Glaswegian Will Sinnott (23 December 1960 ‚Äì 23 May 1991), aka Will Sin, who joined the group in October 1987, on bass and keyboards, freeing up Angus to handle vocals and guitar. Sinnott's musical background was an extensive one. He had already made an impression as part of the Can/SAHB influenced improvisation troupe Edith and the Ladies, and his father, a master wood craftsman, had made guitars for the Incredible String Band and John Martyn. At the start of 1988, the first music videos were shot for the Shamen, those being \\"Christopher Mayhew Says\\" and \\"Knature of a Girl\\". \\"Knature of a Girl\\" was the first record by the Shamen to feature Sinnott, but it was not until June's \\"Jesus Loves Amerika\\" single that the techno influence began to show. By this stage, Angus and Sinnott had become hooked on the acid house movement taking place in London, and its music and clubs were to exert an influence on the pair. Keith McKenzie and Peter Stephenson were less impressed by these new developments, and left the group the following summer, after the January 1989 release of the In Gorbachev We Trust album, which saw the group further enhancing their sound. Over the summer of 1988, they met Mr. C and Evil Eddie Richards, who later both worked with the Shamen to help them transition their music into the rave scene. Angus and Sinnott relocated to London, allowing them to start afresh, and plunge into the emerging rave scene. 1989 was a busy year, as they set out on their Synergy tour, a nightclub experience, combined with live music from the Shamen and others like Orbital, and with DJing from Paul Oakenfold, Mixmaster Morris, Mr C, and Evil Eddie Richards. The tour was to last nearly two years. Synergy was innovative at the time, as a touring rock dance club introducing live bands to clubbers, and house, techno and ambient DJs to rock fans. The Shamen also released the Phorward mini album, produced by ex-Fiction Factory singer/songwriter Kevin Patterson. =1990s= Their third album, En-Tact, was released in 1990, and it spawned the hit singles \\"Move Any Mountain (Progen '91)\\", \\"Hyperreal\\" and \\"Make It Mine\\". Also notable was the appearance of rapper, DJ and producer Mr. C, as well as incorporation of a female vocalist, Plavka Lonich ‚Äì who was intended to become the focal point of the group. The transformation into a successful rave party act was complete. Tensions had already begun to show, however - the band's barely concealed espousal of the then-fashionable new psychedelic drugs and the artistic pressures of altering direction from that of an acceptably skilled guitar band to an electronic dance act. As they continued their Synergy tour, their popularity in the United Kingdom began to rapidly expand. \\"Hyperreal\\", released in March 1991, reached number 28 on the UK Singles Chart. By this time, they realised they were on their way to reaching mainstream popularity. Every Synergy Live show on the fifth and sixth leg of tours were sold out. On the sixth leg of Synergy in April 1991, Gavin Knight and Richard Sharpe joined as the live drummer and keyboardist for the Shamen respectively. In May 1991, with the increased popularity of their band, Will Sin decided to release an EP entitled \\"U Make Me Feel\\" with an unknown female singer under the pseudonym Elsi Curry, and it was released as a promotional record. Later that same month, after the Sixth Mark of the Synergy Tour, and a one-week tour of Russia, the Shamen headed to Tenerife, to film a video for \\"Move Any Mountain\\". On 23 May, Will Sinnott drowned whilst swimming off the coast of La Gomera.Bainbridge, L. (2013). The True Story of Acid House: Britain's Last Youth Culture Revolution. London: Omnibus Press. Colin Angus later said: \\"When it first happened, I was still reeling from the shock of Will's completely unexpected and tragic death, and I couldn't think about the Shamen at all, couldn't see how anything could continue. But as I came to terms with it and thought about the situation I realised that what the Shamen was about was positivity and that positivity is like the spirit of the music and positivity acknowledges the need for change. So for those reasons I elected to carry on and also I knew that the name Shamen really meant a lot to Will and that was one of the main attractions for joining the band for him.\\" In July 1991, Plavka Lonich chose to leave the band, because she was planning to start on her solo career. After finding a new female singer, Cheryl Melder, the Shamen embarked on the start of their Progeny tour. With Mr. C now a full- time member of the Shamen, and Jhelisa Anderson (who was chosen to replace Plavka) providing guest vocals, the Boss Drum album followed in 1992. Boss Drum featured a spoken-word collaboration, \\"Re:Evolution\\" with Terence McKenna, and the Shamen's biggest and most controversial hit: \\"Ebeneezer Goode\\". \\"Ebeneezer Goode\\" was accused of promoting drug use, owing to the refrain, 'Ezer Goode, Ezer Goode' as homophonic with 'E's are good' (E being slang for the drug ecstasy), 'He s ever so good, he's Ebenezer Goode' (using the homophony of \\"he\\" and \\"E\\"), and to double entendre drug references throughout the song. This echoed similar references in previous songs such as \\"Synergy\\"'s 'MDMA-zing... we are together in ecstasy'. Despite ‚Äì or maybe because of ‚Äì the subsequent storm of publicity, the song reached the top of the UK Singles Chart and stayed there for four weeks. Subsequent singles such as \\"Boss Drum\\" and \\"Phorever People\\" were chart hits, and they were voted \\"Best New Act\\" by Radio 1 listeners at the Smash Hits Poll Winners Party in 1992, but after the unexpected success of \\"Ebeneezer Goode\\" some long-term fans believed they paled in comparison to earlier singles. As Terence McKenna observed: :Nothing ruins you for the underground like success. So when Boss Drum went double platinum, they were obviously 'establishment'... I've talked to Colin about this, and he agrees. It would have been wonderful to hit it big at 23. At 35 it becomes a pain in the ass, and you just have to manage the money and the image. However, the Shamen's new mainstream popularity enabled them to release an unusually large number of remix singles, EPs, and LPs during the Boss Drum era, including the \\"Face EP\\", the \\"S.O.S. EP\\", and the On Air and Different Drum albums. On Air featured a series of popular tracks from En-Tact and Boss Drum as performed live on BBC radio; Different Drum was a remix album containing alternate versions of every track from Boss Drum. The tracks \\"Boss Drum\\", \\"LSI (Love Sex Intelligence)\\", \\"Phorever People\\", \\"Ebeneezer Goode\\", and \\"Re:Evolution\\" were all released as singles in their own right. It was however impossible for the band to fully escape the shadow that Sinnot's untimely exit had cast across them. At a time and in a scene when performers were often both masked and anonymous, the emerging early 1990s dance music world had lost one of its more notable personalities. Axis Mutatis was released in 1995, with new vocalist Victoria Wilson-James replacing Jhelisa Anderson. Early special editions of this album featured a bonus disk, Arbor Bona Arbor Mala, an experimental ambient album. Always seeking to push out musical and communication boundaries, the Shamen saw themselves as an information band. Their Internet site Nemeton was amongst the first British music sites to host unique Web based events, e.g. releasing the first ever single and LP on the net in 1995 and it also features a remarkable piece of software devised by Angus to convert the DNA structures of human life into electronic music. \\"S2 Translation\\", a track on Axis Mutatis, was generated using this software. The Shamen continued recording into the late 1990s, releasing two additional LPs with an increasingly experimental bent. Their penultimate studio album, the instrumental Hempton Manor, followed an acrimonious split with their label One Little Indian. It is alleged to have been recorded in seven days to conclude the recording contract with One Little Indian, and the first letter of each track spells out \\"Fuck Birket\\", referring to label founder Derek Birket, who wanted the group to move back into more commercial territory. UV, in 1998, was their last album. UV was released independently on Moksha Recordings. Mr. C has since continued as a house music DJ and became a nightclub owner of The End club. As of 2007, he was also recording as a member of Sycophant Slags, with Francis Harris a.k.a. Adultnapper on Mr. C's Superfreq Records label. Colin Angus worked on a project called Pablo Sandoz, from 2004 to 2008.

The square stands at the theoretical crossing of the city's two main orthogonal streets, Colombo Street and Worcester Street, though in practice both have been either blocked off or detoured around the square itself. The cathedral was badly damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake.  Naming  The square was originally intended to be called Ridley Square, after the Protestant martyr Nicholas Ridley, but in Edward Jollie's 1850 plan of central Christchurch it is clearly marked Cathedral Square. Ridley's co-martyrs and colleague bishops, Cranmer and Latimer have Squares named after them, not far distant from Cathedral Square. The original choice of Ridley is another of Christchurch's many references to Oxford, since Ridley was martyred there. Christchurch Cathedral Square panorama from January 2010  History  In the original survey of central Christchurch (known as the Black Map), which was undertaken in 1850, it was envisaged for Christ's College and ChristChurch Cathedral to be built adjacent to one another in Cathedral Square, modelled on Christ Church, Oxford. The area set aside for the college in Cathedral Square was found to be insufficient, and Henry Sewell suggested in June 1853 to move the college to land reserved for the Christchurch Botanic Gardens. This transaction was formalised through The Cathedral Square Ordinance 1858, a law passed by the Canterbury Provincial Council in October 1858. The ordinance allowed for Colombo Street to go straight through the middle of Cathedral Square at a legal width of , and the cathedral to be placed west of this thoroughfare. Christianity has adopted the practice of praying towards the East as the Orient was thought of as containing the mankind's original home. Hence, most Christian churches are oriented towards the east, and to comply with this convention, Henry Harper, Christchurch's first Bishop, lobbied to have the eastern side of Cathedral Square to be used for the pro-cathedral. That way, the main entrance would face Colombo Street, resulting in praying towards the east in line with convention. The Cathedral Square Amendment Ordinance 1859, which was passed a year after the previous ordinance, formalised the change in placement of the cathedral. Aerial view of Cathedral Square showing the curved alignment of Colombo Street (pre-1954) Just before work on the cathedral's foundations began in 1864, the alignment of Colombo Street through Cathedral Square was changed again by introducing a curve towards the west; the western side of the legal road had a radius of 3 chains 75 links (). The purpose of this change was to allow the placement of the cathedral slightly further west, making its tower visible along Colombo Street from a distance. Up to the point of work starting on the cathedral, here was initially little development. A statue to John Robert Godley, the city's founder, was unveiled on 6 August 1867 on a pedestal opposite the cathedral. It was the first public statue in New Zealand. The city's central post office was located alongside the square in 1879. Over the years Cathedral Square has been redesigned on several occasions. Two significant changes took place when the road in front of the cathedral was closed in 1965, and the road in front of the Post Office closed in 1972. In the late 1990s / early 2000s, the Square underwent a significant reconstruction using new tiling. This was an often criticised project, for example for the amount of glare that the tiles gave off in dry weather conditions, or the tiles being slippery when wet. Although always called a \\"square\\", its shape is that of a cruciform. Registered heritage places The Sevicke Jones Building collapsed in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Cathedral Square has a large number of buildings and statues that are registered as heritage items with Heritage New Zealand. Many of those were damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake and some of these will be lost as a consequence. ;Category I places * ChristChurch Cathedral is arguably the most important heritage building. Its register number is 46 and it was registered on 7 April 1983. * The Press Building was registered on 2 April 1984, with its register number 302.

Transport function  The Chalice alongside the cathedral When steam trams began operating in the city in 1880, they left from the Square. Later, when buses replaced trams in 1954, the Square was used as the main point of departure. Trams returned in 1995, with the introduction of a tourist tram ride around the central city. Most buses left the Square when the Bus Exchange in Lichfield Street opened in November 2000. Since then, the public transport use of the Square was by the airport bus, taxis and shuttles. Since the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, the core of the central city has been closed to the public. The first part of the central city, Cashel Street between Colombo Street and Oxford Terrace, is planned to be open again on 29 October 2011. Other areas, including Cathedral Square, will follow later. For many years, the square was a busy road intersection. In 1962, the road in front of the cathedral was closed. In 1972 it was redeveloped to provide large pedestrian areas, and the south-west quadrant was closed to traffic.  Current function  Chess in Cathedral Square The square was the city's main meeting place for people taking a break from their work, or just visiting the city, and is a regular site of street performers and speakers of all varieties. The most well-known of these was The Wizard of New Zealand. Since the year 2000, The Chalice, a large piece of modern sculpture in the form of an inverted cone, has stood in the square subverting the shape of the spire that rose above the cathedral. The Chalice, designed by New Zealand artist Neil Dawson, is made up of forty-two leaf patterns featuring different native plants. The Square and the area surrounding it now open to the public once more.

Marginality  Constraints are conceptualized as a border or margin.Wicksteed, Philip Henry; The Common Sense of Political Economy (1910), Bk I Ch 2 and elsewhere. The location of the margin for any individual corresponds to his or her endowment, broadly conceived to include opportunities. This endowment is determined by many things including physical laws (which constrain how forms of energy and matter may be transformed), accidents of nature (which determine the presence of natural resources), and the outcomes of past decisions made both by others and by the individual himself or herself. A value that holds true given particular constraints is a marginal value. A change that would be affected as or by a specific loosening or tightening of those constraints is a marginal change, as large as the smallest relevant division of that good or service.von Wieser, Friedrich; √úber den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes [The Nature and Essence of Theoretical Economics] (1884), p. 128. For reasons of tractability, it is often assumed in neoclassical analysis that goods and services are continuously divisible. In such context, a marginal change may be an infinitesimal change or a limit. However, strictly speaking, the smallest relevant division may be quite large.  Some important marginal concepts  The marginal use of a good or service is the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase, or the specific use of the good or service that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease. The marginal utility of a good or service is the utility of the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase in that good or service, or of the specific use that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease. In other words, marginal utility is the utility of the marginal use. The marginal rate of substitution is the rate of substitution that is the least favorable rate, at the margin, at which an agent is willing to exchange units of one good or service for units of another. A marginal benefit is a benefit (howsoever ranked or measured) associated with a marginal change. The term ‚Äúmarginal cost‚Äù may refer to an opportunity cost at the margin, or more narrowly to marginal pecuniary cost ‚Äî that is to say marginal cost measured by forgone cash flow. Other marginal concepts include (but are not limited to): * marginal physical product (sometimes also known as ‚Äúmarginal product‚Äù) **marginal product of labor **marginal product of capital * marginal rate of transformation, the rate at which one output or result must be sacrificed in order to increase another output or result * marginal revenue product * marginal propensity to save and consume * marginal tax rate Marginalism is the use of marginal concepts to explain economic phenomena. The related concept of elasticity is the ratio of the incremental percentage change in one variable with respect to an incremental percentage change in another variable.

Before his capture, the I-5 Killer was suspected of multiple sexual assaults and murders. Though convicted in only one murder, he has been linked to a total of 18, and is suspected of having killed up to 44 people. A native of Oregon, Woodfield was the third child of a prominent Newport family. He began to exhibit abnormal behaviors during his teenage years, and was arrested for indecent exposure while still in high school. An athlete for much of his life, Woodfield played as a wide receiver for the Portland State Vikings, and was drafted by the NFL in 1974 to play for the Green Bay Packers, but was cut from the team during training after a series of indecent exposure arrests. In 1975, Woodfield began a string of robberies and sexual assaults on women in Portland, which he committed at knifepoint. Between 1980 and 1981, he committed multiple murders in cities along the I-5 corridor in Washington, Oregon, and California; his earliest-documented murder was that of Cherie Ayers, a former classmate whom he had known since childhood, in December 1980. After committing numerous robberies, sexual assaults, and murders, Woodfield was arrested in March 1981, and convicted in June of the murder of Shari Hull and attempted murder of her co-worker, Beth Wilmot, and sentenced to life imprisonment plus 90 years. In a subsequent trial, he was convicted of sodomy and improper use of a weapon in a sexual assault case, receiving 35 additional years to his sentence. Woodfield has never confessed to any of the crimes of which he has been accused or convicted. Though he has only been convicted of one murder and one attempted murder, he has been linked via DNA and other methods to numerous unsolved homicides in the ensuing decades. Authorities have estimated his total number of killings to be as many as 44, and CBS News named him one of the deadliest serial killers in American history. He is currently incarcerated at the Oregon State Penitentiary. Early life =Childhood= Woodfield was born December 26, 1950 in Salem, Oregon, the third child of an upper-middle-class family. His mother was a homemaker, and his father was an executive at Pacific Northwest Bell. He has two older sisters, one of whom went on to become a doctor, and the other an attorney. The Woodfield family was \\"well-known and respected\\" in their community. Woodfield was raised in Otter Rock, Oregon, a small seaside town on the central Oregon coast, approximately north of Newport. Popular among his peers, Woodfield was a football star at Newport High School. Though his childhood was by all accounts stable, Woodfield began to exhibit sexually dysfunctional behaviors during junior high school, particularly exposing himself in public. While in high school, Woodfield exposed himself to a group of teenage girls on Yaquina Bay Bridge, and was arrested for indecent exposure. His football coaches helped conceal the incident to prevent him from being ousted from the team, though his parents forced him to attend therapy over the incident. =College years and football career= After graduating high school, Woodfield's criminal record was expunged, and he attended Treasure Valley Community College in Ontario, Oregon, later transferring to Portland State University in Portland in 1970, where he played for the Portland State Vikings as a wide receiver. At Portland State, he was active in Campus Crusade for Christ, a Christian student group, and lived in an apartment located on the South Park Blocks. Gary Hamblet, Woodfield's football coach, recalled: \\"When he was with me, he was the nicest, most gentlemanly kid I ever knew. He was quiet and polite, hard-working and real coachable. He sucked-in everything I tried to coach him.\\" Other teammates and peers of Woodfield recalled him as \\"soft-spoken\\" and \\"kind of a loner\\" who \\"didn't have a lot of friends,\\" but noted his athleticism. Despite his thriving in college, Woodfield was arrested on several occasions for petty crimes: first in 1970 for vandalizing the apartment of his ex-girlfriend, and later in 1972 for public indecency in Vancouver, Washington. In 1973, he was arrested again for public indecency in Multnomah County. Woodfield chose to drop out of college three semesters shy of graduating with his B.S. in physical education, and was selected as a wide receiver in the 1974 NFL Draft by the Green Bay Packers in the 17th round (428th pick). Woodfield tried to establish himself with the Packers during Coach and General Manager Dan Devine's last season, but could not shake his problems with a trip across the country. He signed a contract in February 1974 but was cut during training camp, failing to make the team's final roster. After being cut by the Packers, Woodfield played the 1974 season with the semi-pro Manitowoc Chiefs and worked for Oshkosh Truck. A similar arrest, in Portland, earned him more suspended time in June 1973. In 1974, after a dozen \\"flashing\\" incidents called unwelcome attention to Woodfield, the Packers formally cut him from the NFL. =First crime spree= Woodfield left Wisconsin in late 1974 and returned to Portland, disgraced by his failure to maintain his football career. In early 1975, several Portland women were accosted by a knife-wielding man, forced to perform oral sex and then robbed of their handbags. Law enforcement responded to the string of crimes by having female police officers act as decoys. On March 3, 1975, Woodfield was arrested after being caught with marked money from one of the undercover officers. Upon interrogation, he confessed to the crimes, blaming poor sexual impulse control, which he claimed was a result of his use of steroids. In April 1975, he pled guilty to reduced charges of second-degree robbery. Woodfield was sentenced to ten years in prison. He was freed on parole in July 1979, after having served four years. Murders and subsequent crimes =First murders= On October 9, 1980, Cherie Ayers, an X-ray technician and former classmate of Woodfield, was raped and murdered in her apartment in the 9000 block of SW Ninth Place in downtown Portland. Her body was discovered on October 11 by her fianc√©. She had been bludgeoned and stabbed repeatedly in the neck. Ayers, a University of Oregon graduate, had known Woodfield since second grade, having attended the same schools in Newport. During Woodfield's prior four-year imprisonment, he and Ayers had corresponded via letters. Suspecting Woodfield's involvement, Ayers' family provided his name to law enforcement. He was questioned but refused to sit for a polygraph test. Homicide detectives found his answers generally \\"evasive and deceptive\\" but, because his blood type did not match semen found in the victim's body, no charges were filed. One month later, on the morning of November 27 (Thanksgiving Day), Woodfield arrived at the north Portland home of Darcey Renee Fix, 22, planning to assault her. Woodfield had known Fix during college as an ex-girlfriend of one his close friends. Douglas Keith Altig, 24, was at Fix's home when Woodfield arrived. Both Fix and Altig were subsequently bound and shot to death execution-style in the home, and Fix's .32-caliber revolver was missing from the scene. Due to his acquaintance with Fix, Woodfield was questioned about the murders, but law enforcement found no concrete evidence pointing to his involvement. =I-5 Bandit robberies= Various composites of Woodfield during his robberies in late 1980 and early 1981 After committing the murders of Fix and Altig, Woodfield began a series of robberies throughout the northwest: On December 9, 1980, Woodfield, wearing a fake beard, held up a Vancouver, Washington gas station at gunpoint. In Eugene, Oregon four nights later, on December 13, he raided an ice cream parlor. On December 14, he robbed a drive-in restaurant in Albany. During one of the robberies, Woodfield wore what appeared to be a Band-Aid or athletic tape across the bridge of his nose, similar to nasal strips worn by football players. On December 21, Woodfield (again wearing a false beard) accosted a waitress in Seattle, trapping her in a restaurant bathroom and forcing her at gunpoint to give him a handjob. By January 1981, law enforcement had dubbed the robber the \\"I-5 Bandit\\", given his apparent preference for committing crimes along the Interstate 5 corridor. On January 8, he held up the same Vancouver gas station he had robbed in December, this time forcing a female attendant to expose her breasts after he emptied the cash register. Three days later, on January 11, he robbed a market in Eugene. The next day, January 12, he shot and wounded a female grocery clerk at a store in Sutherlin, Oregon. On January 14, a man matching the description of the I-5 bandit and wearing a false beard invaded a home occupied by two sisters, aged eight and ten. He forced the girls to undress and sexually assaulted them. Four days later, in Salem, a man matching the same description entered an office building and sexually abused two women, Shari Hull and Beth Wilmot, after which he killed Hull and wounded Wilmot, leaving her for dead. On January 26 and 29, he traveled to southern Oregon and committed robberies in Eugene, Medford and Grants Pass. In the latter location, two females, a clerk and customer, were assaulted by the robber. =Later murders= On February 3, 1981, the bodies of Donna Eckard, 37, and her 14-year-old daughter were found together in a bed in their home at Mountain Gate, California, north of Redding. Each had been shot several times in the head. Forensic tests showed that the girl had also been sodomized. The same day in Redding, a female store clerk was kidnapped, raped and sodomized in a holdup. An identical crime was reported in Yreka on February 4, with the same man robbing an Ashland, Oregon motel that night. Five days later in Corvallis, a man matching the I-5 Bandit's description held up a fabric store, molesting the clerk and her customer before he left. On February 12, 1981, robberies committed by a man matching the I-5 Bandit's description occurred in Vancouver, Olympia, and Bellevue, Washington. The Olympia and Bellevue incidents included three sexual assaults. Upon an impending visit to Portland, Woodfield planned a Valentine's Day party at the city's downtown Marriott Hotel, inviting friends and acquaintances from college. After no guests came, Woodfield drove to the Beaverton home of 18-year-old Julie Reitz, whom Woodfield had met while working as a bouncer at The Faucet, a bar in Portland. He arrived at her home around 2 a.m. on February 15. Around 4 a.m., he raped and then shot Reitz in the head, killing her. Police investigating the scene determined that Reitz had had a glass of wine with her attacker, and had also begun to prepare coffee: a package of instant coffee was discovered on the kitchen counter, and water in a kettle had been left to completely boil down. Arrest and trials By February 28, the investigation was now focused on Woodfield, but by then the I-5 Bandit had struck three more times: in Eugene on February 18 and 21, and with another sexual assault in Corvallis on February 25. Detectives in Marion County assembled a call log showing Woodfield had placed calls via calling cards at pay phones near the murder sites around the times they were committed. On March 5, 1981, Woodfield was brought into the Salem Police Department for an interrogation after Lisa Garcia positively identified him in a photo lineup. His apartment in Springfield, Oregon was subsequently searched two days later by warrant; inside, law enforcement discovered a spent .32 shell casing inside a racquetball bag, as well as a roll of tape that matched the tape found on the victims. On March 7, Woodfield was taken into custody after being positively identified by several Oregon robbery victims. On March 16, indictments for murder, rape, sodomy, attempted kidnapping, armed robbery, and illegal possession of firearms were initiated from various jurisdictions in Washington and Oregon. In the summer of 1981, Woodfield was tried in Salem for the murder of Hull, as well as charges of sodomy and attempted murder (of Wilmot).National News Briefs. United Press International, October 13, 1981, Tuesday, PM cycle. Wilmot testified against him in the trial, and was key in the prosecution's conviction. Chris Van Dyke, son of actor Dick Van Dyke, was the Marion County, Oregon District Attorney at the time and prosecuted the case. Van Dyke would later characterize Woodfield as \\"the coldest, most detached defendant I've ever seen.\\" On June 26, 1981, after three-and-a-half hours of deliberation, Woodfield was convicted on all counts and sentenced to life in prison plus 90 years. In October 1981, a second trial was held in Benton County, in which Woodfield received sodomy and weapons charges tied to one of the attacks in a restaurant bathroom. Prior to this trial, his counsel attempted to move the trial from Willamette Valley; he felt that, owing to the publicity the case received, Woodfield would not get a fair trial there.Judge refuses a change of venue for I-5 bandit suspect. United Press International, September 24, 1981, Thursday, PM cycle. The judge in the case denied counsel's request, along with a request to hypnotize a prosecution witness in an effort to determine if that witness had been influenced by the media coverage. Woodfield was convicted by the jury, and had an additional 35 years added to his already-instated sentence. Despite the apparent links with countless other crimes and homicides, Woodfield would not be prosecuted for the majority of the crimes he was believed to have committed. Unable to afford multiple trials, the State of Oregon was satisfied with Woodfield's existing life sentence. Post-conviction Woodfield is serving his sentences at the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem.Domestic News. United Press International, October 3, 1983, Monday, AM cycle. In October 1983, he was injured by a fellow inmate during a prison disturbance. In April 1987, Woodfield filed a $12 million libel suit against author Ann Rule,Tims, Dana. Murderer's libel suit dismissed. The Oregonian, January 18, 1988. the true crime author who had written The I-5 Killer. The account of Woodfield's life and crime spree became a best-selling book in 1984. The Federal Court in Oregon dismissed the lawsuit in January 1988, citing that the statute of limitations on such a lawsuit had expired. By 1990, after the discovery of more victims, Woodfield was suspected in as many as 44 homicides.Burgess, Anthony. Book Review: The revenge of the failures with time to kill; 'The Serial Killers' - Colin Wilson & Donald Seaman: W H Allen, 6.99 pounds. The Independent, December 21, 1990. In 2001 and 2006, DNA testing linked Woodfield to two additional murders in Oregon that occurred from 1980 and 1981.Bernstein, Maxine. DNA links 'I-5 killer' to 1980 slaying. The Oregonian, February 9, 2006. During his time in the penitentiary, Woodfield has married three times and divorced twice. Some letters he wrote from prison were eventually sold online as a collection titled, The Serial Killer Letters and published by The Charles Press. In one of these letters, he wrote to journalist Jennifer Furio: Modus operandi and victim profile The majority of Woodfield's victims were petite white women in their twenties, many of middle-class backgrounds. A great many of his victims‚Äîparticularly in instances of robbery and sexual assault‚Äîwere young employees of restaurants and convenience stores located along Interstate 5, which Woodfield traversed in his 1974 Champagne Edition gold Volkswagen Beetle. In some instances, Woodfield's attacks were undertaken entirely at random, while in others, the murders were incited by rejected sexual advances. His level of acquaintance with his victims varied; some he knew personally, while others were complete strangers. During his robberies, assaults, and killings, Woodfield typically concealed his identity by wearing a hoodie, a fake beard, and most curiously, a strip of athletic tape across his nose. Police believe Woodfield may have done so to obscure his features and prevent victims from identifying him in a police lineup. Woodfield's victims were typically killed via gunshot, and his crimes were sexually-motivated. Jim Lawrence, a detective for Portland's cold case unit, noted Woodfield's lack of remorse or responsibility in his crimes, saying: \\"If you‚Äôre talking about somebody moving toward some form of rehabilitation, they had to at some point acknowledge they are responsible for their own behaviors. That is not Randy Woodfield.\\" Lawrence also noted Woodfield's egotism during his early interrogations: \\"When he was interviewed, he'd tell detectives that he'd never rape a girl. He said he didn't have to. They wanted him.\\" Ann Rule, who documented Woodfield's crimes in her book The I-5 Killer, suggested that rejection and feelings of inadequacy were factors that drove him to violence, particularly against women. She also characterized Woodfield as a \\"smooth ladies' man\\" whose good looks and disposition aided his ability to trap victims. Unlike many serial killers, whose killing patterns are characterized by intervals, or \\"cooling off periods,\\" Woodfield's murders and other crimes escalated rapidly, increasing in successive frequency. Victims Woodfield never confessed to any of the murders of which he has been accused or linked to. Though convicted only in the murder of Shari Hull, Woodfield has been linked to numerous other murders via DNA and other methods; criminologists and detectives have provided estimated total numbers of killings ranging from 25 to as many as 44 unsolved homicides. Woodfield is also estimated to have committed at least 60 unsolved rapes. The following is a list of Woodfield's confirmed victims: =1980= ; October 9: Cherie Lynn Ayers (22): A former classmate of Woodfield's; was found in her Portland home on October 11; was bludgeoned and stabbed multiple times in the neck. ; November 27: Darci Renee Fix (22) and Douglas Keith Altig (24): Both found shot to death with a .32 revolver in Altig's Portland home. ; December 21: Unnamed woman (25): Assaulted at gunpoint in a Seattle restroom, forced to masturbate Woodfield; survived. =1981= ; January 11: Susie Benet (20): A market clerk in Sutherlin, Oregon, shot by Woodfield during robbery; survived. ; January 18: Shari Lynn Hull (20) and Beth Wilmot (20): Employees at a Transamerica office in Keizer, Oregon, accosted by Woodfield during their evening work shift; sexually assaulted both women before shooting them each in the head. Hull died of her injuries; Wilmot survived. ; February 3: Unnamed woman (18): Kidnapped at gunpoint and raped near Redding, California in the morning hours; survived. ; February 3: Donna Lee Eckard (37) and daughter Janelle Charlotte Jarvis (14): Both found sexually assaulted and shot to death in their Shasta County home. Jarvis was determined to have been sodomized after death. ; February 4: Unnamed woman: Kidnapped and raped in Yreka, California; survived. ; February 15: Julie Ann Reitz (18): Raped and shot to death in her Beaverton, Oregon home around 4 a.m.; was an acquaintance of Woodfield's through his job as a bouncer. =Other possible victims= Retracing Woodfield's movements along Interstate 5, law enforcement have identified at least 25 other potential murders, while other estimations suggest up to 44. Notable is Martha Morrison (17), who disappeared in Eugene, Oregon in September 1974, and was found murdered the following month near Vancouver, Washington; her remains were unidentified until 2015. Both Woodfield and Ted Bundy have been considered suspects in her murder. During the spring of 1980, Marsha Weatter (19) and Kathy Allen (18) vanished while hitch-hiking from the Spokane, Washington area to their hometown of Fairbanks, Alaska. Their bodies were found in May 1981. Suspected serial killer Martin Lee Sanders was later connected to their murders, but as of 2018 the case remains unsolved.

They can be public or private, and often have well-known brand names. Undergraduate courses at many research universities are often academic rather than vocational and may not prepare students for particular careers, but many employers value degrees from research universities because they teach fundamental life skills such as critical thinking. Globally, research universities are predominantly public universities, with notable exceptions being the United States and Japan. Institutions of higher education that are not research universities (or do not aspire to that designation, such as liberal arts colleges) instead place more emphasis on student instruction or other aspects of tertiary education, and their faculty members are under less pressure to publish or perish.  History  The concept of the modern research university first arose in early 19th-century Germany, where Wilhelm von Humboldt championed his vision of Einheit von Lehre und Forschung (the unity of teaching and research), as a means of producing an education that focused on the main areas of knowledge (the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities) rather than on the previous goals of the university education, which was to develop an understanding of truth, beauty, and goodness. Roger L. Geiger, a historian specializing in the history of higher education in the United States, has argued that \\"the model for the American research university was established by five colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution (Harvard, Yale, Pennsylvania, Princeton, and Columbia); five state universities (Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, and California); and five private institutions conceived from their inception as research universities (MIT, Cornell, Johns Hopkins, Stanford, and Chicago).\\" The quoted sentence is Crow and Dabars' paraphrasing of Geiger's analysis. In turn, research universities were essential to the establishment of American hegemony by the end of the 20th century. In particular, Columbia and Harvard were instrumental in the development of the American film industry (Hollywood), MIT and Stanford were leaders in building the American military‚Äìindustrial complex, and Berkeley and Stanford played a central role in the development of Silicon Valley. Since the 1960s, American research universities‚Äîespecially the leading American public research university system, the University of California‚Äîhave served as models for research universities around the world. Today, the most prestigious research universities in North America belong to‚Äîor aspire to belong to‚Äîthe Association of American Universities, a selective group of 65 major research universities in the United States and Canada. Characteristics John Taylor defines the key characteristics of successful research universities as: * \\"Presence of pure and applied research\\" * \\"Delivery of research-led teaching\\" * \\"Breadth of academic disciplines\\" * \\"High proportion of postgraduate research programmes\\" * \\"High levels of external income\\" * \\"An international perspective\\" Philip Altbach defines a different, although similar, set of key characteristics for what research universities need to become successful: * At the top of the academic hierarchy in a differentiated higher education system and receiving appropriate support * Overwhelmingly public institutions * Little competition from non-university research institutions, unless these have strong connections to the universities * More funding than other universities to attract the best staff and students and support research infrastructure * Adequate and sustained budgets * Potential for income generation from student fees and intellectual property * Suitable facilities * Autonomy * Academic freedom A 2012 National Academies of Science report defined research universities, in the US context, as having values of intellectual freedom, initiative and creativity, excellence, and openness, with such additional characteristics as: * Being large and comprehensive ‚Äì Clark Kerr's \\"multiversity\\" * Emphasizing the undergraduate residential experience (flagged specifically as distinguishing US research universities from those in continental Europe) * Integrating graduate education with research * Having faculty engaged in research and scholarship * Conducting research at high levels * Having enlightened and bold leadership Global university rankings use metrics that primarily measure research to rank universities. Some also have criteria for inclusion based on the concept of a research university such as teaching at both undergraduate and postgraduate level and conducting work in multiple faculties (QS World University Rankings), or teaching undergraduates, having a research output of more than 1000 research papers over 5 years, and no more than 80% of activity in a single subject area (Times Higher Education World University Rankings). Worldwide distribution The QS World University Ranking for 2021 included 1002 research universities. The region with the highest number was Europe, with 39.8%, followed by Asia Pacific with 26.7%, the US and Canada with 15.6%, Latin America with 10.8% and the Middle East and Africa with 7%. All regions except the Middle East and Africa were represented in the top 100. The largest number of new entrants to the rankings were from East Asia and Eastern Europe, followed by Southern Europe. By individual country, the US has the most institutions with 151, followed by the UK with 84, China with 51, and Germany with 45. The top 200 shows a similar pattern with the US having 45 universities, the UK 26 and Germany 12. By comparison, the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education (2015) identifies 115 US universities as \\"Doctoral Universities: Highest Research Activity\\" and a further 107 as \\"Doctoral Universities: Higher Research Activity\\", while Altbach estimated that there were around 220 research universities in the US in 2013. The Academic Ranking of World Universities shows a similar distribution, with 185 of their 500 ranked institutions in 2020 coming from Europe, 161 from the Americas, 149 from Asia/Oceania and 5 from Africa. Again, all regions except Africa are represented in the top 100, although the Americas are represented solely by universities from the US and Canada. The US again has the most universities from a single country, 206, followed by China with 168, the UK with 65 and Germany with 49. The top 200 shows the similar pattern: the US with 65 followed by China with 24, the UK with 20 and Germany with 10. Times Higher Education only gives a breakdown by country and only for its top 200; this again has the US top, with 62, followed by the UK with 31, Germany with 20 and the Netherlands with 13. The top 200 features one university from Africa (the University of Cape Town), but none from Latin America. The U.S. News and World Report Best Global Universities Ranking 2021 gives numbers by country for the 1500 universities ranked from 86 countries: the US is again top, with 255, followed by China with 176 and the UK with 87. The 2020 CWTS Leiden Ranking includes 1,176 universities in the rankings from 65 countries: China tops the list for the first time, with 204, followed by the US with 198, the UK with 58 and Germany with 54.

She had previously been Tonnant of the French Navy and the lead ship of the . The British captured her in August 1793 during the Siege of Toulon but the French recaptured her when the siege was broken in December. Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson captured her at Aboukir Bay off the coast of Egypt at the Battle of the Nile on 1 August 1798. She was taken into British service as HMS Tonnant. She went on to fight at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, during the Napoleonic Wars. Tonnant was the flagship of Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane during most of the campaign in the Chesapeake Bay during the simultaneous War of 1812 with the United States. On 13‚Äì14 September 1814 Francis Scott Key and John Stuart Skinner were dining aboard the ship after negotiations to release some captured prisoners, during the Battle of Baltimore. Key went on to write what later became the words to the American national anthem, \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" after watching the British attack on Baltimore's Fort McHenry. Tonnant was broken up in 1821. French service Death of Du Petit-Thouars, by Auguste Mayer Tonnant was the lead ship in a class of 80-gun two-deckers built to a design by Jacques-No√´l San√©, and ordered on 19 October 1787. She was laid down at the Toulon Dockyard in November 1787 and launched on 24 October 1789. Anglo-Spanish forces captured her there in August 1793, but left her when they withdrew in December. She then reverted to the French Navy. Tonnant fought in the battles of Genoa on 14 March 1795 and The Nile on 1 August 1798 under Aristide Aubert Du Petit Thouars. During the battle, she severely damaged , causing nearly two hundred casualties, including 50 killed and 143 wounded. Among the dead was Majestics captain, George Blagdon Westcott. Du Petit- Thouars, who had both legs and an arm shot off, commanded his ship until he died. Tonnant was the only French ship still engaged in the morning, with her colours flying, though aground. It was not until 3 August that she finally struck her colours. The British took her into their service, registering and naming her as HMS Tonnant on 9 December 1798. She arrived at the naval base at Plymouth, England on 17 July 1799. Even before she formally entered British service, she was among the vessels that participated in the capture of the Greek vessel Ardito on 24 October 1798. Tonnant was commissioned under Captain Loftus Bland in January 1799, with Captain Robert Fitzgerald taking over in February. He sailed her to Gibraltar and then back to Britain. Upon her arrival in Plymouth in 1800 she was laid up in ordinary.  British service  =Napoleonic Wars= Tonnant underwent repairs between December 1801 and April 1803. She was commissioned in March 1803 under Captain Sir Edward Pellew. Under his command she participated in the Blockade of Ferrol. On 24 May the cutter Resolution captured Esperance and Vigilant, with Tonnant sharing in the capture. Next, Tonnant, and captured the Dutch ships Coffee Baum and Maasluys on 2 and 4 June. Tonnant then was one of the vessels that shared in the recapture on 27 August of . Tonnant was part of Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Calder's squadron off Cape Ortegal when she encountered the French ships Duguay-Trouin and Guerri√®re on 2 September 1803. The two French Navy warships had broken out of the blockade when they met Tonnant. They escaped her but British naval forces of varying strengths harried them during their journey back to port and they only just made it to the safety of A Coru√±a. Tonnant shared in the capture of Perseverance on 28 October, though the prize money was much less. Then on 29 November, destroyed Bayonnoise; Tonnant was among the vessels sharing, by agreement, in the bounty money. In the new year, on 18 February 1804, Tonnant and the ships of the squadron recaptured the brig Eliza. Later in 1804 Tonnant was in the Channel under Captain William Henry Jervis. He drowned off Brest when going in his gig from Tonnant to on 26 January 1805. Jervis had just arrived from Rochefort and was anxious to impart his intelligence to the commander-in-chief.Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, p.292. Captain Charles Tyler replaced Jervis in March. During the Battle of Trafalgar (21 October 1805) she captured the 74-gun . Tonnant lost 26 officers and men killed and 50 officers and men wounded in the battle, with Tyler being among the wounded. Tonnant underwent a refit at Portsmouth between January and June 1806. She was recommissioned in May under Captain Thomas Browne. She then served as flagship for Rear-Admiral Eliab Harvey. While under his command distinguished herself in a number of small cutting out expeditions. In July 1807 she was under Captain Richard Hancock and served as flagship for Rear- Admiral Michael de Courcy. In 1809 she was under the command of Captain James Bowen when she recaptured Ann of Leith on 8 April. Tonnant then was among the vessels sharing in the captures of Goede Hoop on 9 July and Carl Ludwig on 2 August. Between November and December 1809 she was under repair at Plymouth. In 1810 she served under Captain Sir John Gore. Lloyd's List reported on 14 June 1811 that French privateer Adolphe had captured George and Mary, but that Tonnant had recaptured George and Mary, which had been sailing from the West Indies and which arrived in Plymouth on 11 June.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4571. On 24 March 1812, still under the command of Gore, Tonnant was off Ushant when she captured the French privateer Emilie. Emilie was armed with twelve 10-pounder guns and had a crew of 84 men. She was nine days out of Saint-Malo and had captured one vessel, a Spanish merchant ship that the Royal Navy had recaptured on the 24th. At the time that she captured Emilie, Tonnant was in company with , , , and . Then on 18 April Tonnant captured Martha. On 12 May, captured Betsy. Abercrombie was in company with Tonnant, , , and . Tonnant then again underwent repair between August and December 1812, this time at Chatham. =War of 1812= Tonnant joined the War of 1812 late. She was fitted for sea in the first quarter of 1814, being recommissioned in January under Captain Alexander Skene. In October Captain Charles Kerr assumed command as Tonnant served as the flagship for Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane during most of the campaign in Chesapeake Bay. From her he directed attacks on Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" It was aboard Tonnant that the Americans, Colonel John Stuart Skinner and Francis Scott Key, dined with Vice Admiral Cochrane, Rear Admiral Sir George Cockburn and Major General Robert Ross, where they negotiated the release of a prisoner, Dr. William Beanes.Shortly thereafter a sniper would kill Ross while Ross was leading his forces against Baltimore. After his release, Skinner, Key and Beanes were allowed to return to their own sloop, but were not allowed to return to Baltimore because they had become familiar with the strength and position of British units and knew of the British intention to attack Baltimore. As a result, Key witnessed the bombarding of Fort McHenry and was inspired to write a poem called Defence of Fort M'Henry, later named \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\". During the bombardment, provided the \\"rockets red glare\\" whilst Meteor provided at least some of the \\"bombs bursting in air\\" that feature in the lyrics. The body of Major General Ross After Major General Robert Ross's death in the Battle of North Point, his body was stored in a barrel of 129 gallons (586 l) of Jamaican rum aboard Tonnant. When she was diverted to New Orleans for the forthcoming battle (see above), the body was later shipped on the British ship to Halifax, Nova Scotia where his body was interred on 29 September 1814 in the Old Burying Ground. New Orleans Tonnant continued to serve Cochrane as a flagship when he directed the British naval forces at the Battle of New Orleans. Immediately before the battle, boats from Tonnant participated in the British victory at the Battle of Lake Borgne. On 8 December 1814, two US gunboats fired on , and the sixth- rate frigate while they were passing the chain of small islands that runs parallel to the shore between Mobile and Lake Borgne. Between 12 and 15 December 1814, Captain Lockyer of Sophie led a flotilla of some 50 boats, barges, gigs and launches to attack the US gunboats. Lockyer drew his flotilla from the fleet that was massing against New Orleans, including the 74-gun third rates and Tonnant, and a number of other vessels including Armide, Seahorse, and Meteor. Lockyer deployed the boats in three divisions, of which he led one. Captain Montresor of the gun-brig Manly commanded the second, and Captain Roberts of Meteor commanded the third. After rowing for 36 hours, the British met the Americans at St. Joseph's Island. On 13 December 1814, the British attacked the one-gun schooner . On the morning of 14 December, the British engaged the Americans in a short, violent battle. The British captured or destroyed almost the entire American force, including the tender, , and five gunboats. The British lost 17 men killed and 77 wounded; Tonnant had three men killed and 15 wounded, one of whom died later. then evacuated the wounded. In 1821 the survivors of the flotilla shared in the distribution of head-money arising from the capture of the American gunboats and sundry bales of cotton. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"14 Dec Boat Service 1814\\" to 205 survivors (from all the participating boats). Tonnant was off New Orleans in January 1815, and in the vicinity of the attack on Fort Bowyer in February 1814. She left the anchorage off Mobile Bay on 18 February and arrived in Havana on 24 February 1815, accompanied by and .Letter from Admiral Cochrane to the Admiralty dated 25 February 1814. This is within WO 1/143 folio 14, which can be downloaded for a fee from the UK National Archives website =Post-war and fate= Tonnant returned to England in May 1815. She then served as the flagship for Admiral Lord Keith when she took part in the exiling of Napoleon to St. Helena in 1815, though she was not part of the flotilla that took him there. Captain John Tailour assumed command in November. From 1816 to 1817 she was the Flagship of Rear- Admiral Sir Benjamin Hallowell on the Cork station. Tonnant was paid off into ordinary in November 1818. She was broken up at Plymouth in March 1821.

Spode was founded by Josiah Spode (1733‚Äì1797) in 1770, and was responsible for perfecting two extremely important techniques that were crucial to the worldwide success of the English pottery industry in the century to follow. He perfected the technique for transfer printing in underglaze blue on fine earthenware in 1783‚Äì1784 ‚Äì a development that led to the launch in 1816 of Spode's Blue Italian range, which has remained in production ever since. Josiah Spode is also often credited with developing, around 1790, the formula for fine bone china that was generally adopted by the industry. His son, Josiah Spode II, was certainly responsible for the successful marketing of English bone china. Today, Spode is owned by Portmeirion Group, a pottery and homewares company based in Stoke-on-Trent. Many items in Spode's Blue Italian and Woodland ranges are made at Portmeirion Group's factory in Stoke-on-Trent. Dish, 1831, manufactured by Spode Ceramic Works V&A; Museum no. 566A-1902 right  Foundation  Josiah Spode is known to have worked for Thomas Whieldon from the age of 16 until he was 21. He then worked in a number of partnerships until he went into business for himself, renting a small potworks in the town of Stoke-on-Trent in 1767; in 1776 he completed the purchase of what became the Spode factory until 2008. His early products comprised earthenwares such as creamware (a fine cream-coloured earthenware) and pearlware (a fine earthenware with a bluish glaze) as well as a range of stonewares including black basalt, caneware, and jasper which had been popularised by Josiah Wedgwood. The history and products of the Spode factory have inspired generations of historians and collectors, and a useful interactive online exhibition was launched in October 2010.Spodeceramics.com = Underglaze blue transfer printing = Josiah Spode I is creditedHayden 1925, p. viii. with the introduction of underglaze blue transfer printing on earthenware in 1783‚Äì84. The Worcester and Caughley factories had commenced transfer printing underglaze and over glaze on porcelain in the early 1750s, and from 1756 overglaze printing was also applied to earthenware and stoneware. The processes for underglaze and overglaze decoration were very different. Overglaze \\"bat printing\\" on earthenware was a fairly straightforward process, and designs in a range of colours including black, red and lilac were produced. Underglaze \\"hot-press\\" printing was limited to the colours that would withstand the subsequent glaze firing, and a rich blue was the predominant colour. To adapt the process from the production of small porcelain teawares to larger earthenware dinnerwares required the creation of more flexible paper to transmit the designs from the engraved copper plate to the biscuit earthenware body, and the development of a glaze recipe that brought the color of the black-blue cobalt print to a brilliant perfection. When Spode employed the skilled engraver Thomas Lucas and printer James Richard, both of the Caughley factory, in 1783 he was able to introduce high quality blue printed earthenware to the market. Thomas Minton, another Caughley-trained engraver, also supplied copper plates to Spode until he opened his own factory in Stoke-on-Trent in 1796. Hayden 1925, 46‚Äì53. This method involved the engraving of a design on a copper plate, which was then printed onto gummed tissue.Robert Copeland, Blue and white transfer printed pottery (Osprey publishing (Shire series), 2000), p. 11 ff. The colour paste was worked into the cut areas of the copper plate and wiped from the uncut surfaces, and then printed by passing through rollers. These designs, including edge-patterns which had to be manipulated in sections, were cut out using scissors and applied to the biscuit-fired ware (using a white fabric), itself prepared with a gum solution. The tissue was then floated off in water, leaving the pattern adhering to the plate. This was then dipped in the glaze and returned to the kiln for the glost firing. Blue underglaze transfer became a standard feature of Staffordshire pottery. Spode also used on-glaze transfers for other wares. The well-known Spode blue-and-white dinner services with engraved sporting scenes and Italian views were developed under Josiah Spode the younger, but continued to be reproduced into much later times. = The bone china formula = During the 18th century, many English potters were striving and competing to discover the industrial secret of the production of fine translucent porcelain. The Plymouth and Bristol factories, and (from 1782 to 1810) the New Hall (Staffordshire) factory under Richard Champion's patent, were producing hard paste similar to Oriental porcelain. The technique was developed by adding calcined bone to this glassy frit, for example in the productions of Bow porcelain and Chelsea porcelain, and this was carried on from at least the 1750s onwards. Soapstone porcelains further added steatite, known as French chalk, for instance at Worcester and Caughley factories.The source for this section is Hayden 1925, Chapter 5, pp. 88‚Äì104. The bone porcelains, especially those of Spode, Minton, Davenport and Coalport, eventually established the standards for soft-paste porcelain which were later (after 1800) maintained widely. Although the Bow porcelain factory, Chelsea porcelain factory, Royal Worcester and Royal Crown Derby factories had, before Spode, established a proportion of about 40‚Äì45 per cent calcined bone in the formula as standard, it was Spode who first abandoned the practice of calcining or fritting the bone with some of the other ingredients, and used the simple mixture of bone ash, china stone and kaolin, which since his time set the basic recipe of bone china. The traditional bone china recipe was 6 parts bone-ash, 4 parts china stone and 3.5 parts kaolin, all finely ground together. Josiah Spode I effectively finalised the formula, and appears to have been doing so between 1789 and 1793. It remained an industrial secret for some time. The importance of his innovations has been disputed, being played down by Professor Sir Arthur Church in his English Porcelain, estimated practically by William Burton, and being very highly esteemed by Spode's contemporary Alexandre Brongniart, director of the S√®vres manufactory, in his Trait√© des Arts C√©ramiques, and by M. L. Solon hailed as a revolutionary improvement. Many fine examples of the elder Spode's productions were destroyed in a fire at Alexandra Palace, London in 1873, where they were included in an exhibition of nearly five thousand specimens of English pottery and porcelain. As the understanding of the work of the early potters depends in part on the study of actual specimens, the loss was both aesthetic and scientific. The business was carried on through his sons at Stoke until April 1833. Spode's London retail shop in Portugal Street went by the name of Spode, Son, and Copeland.Geoffrey A. Godden, The Handbook of British Pottery and Porcelain Marks (Barrie and Jenkins, London 1972 (Revised Edition)), p. 119. See also the standard monograph, Leonard Whiter, Spode: A History of the Family, Factory and Wares from 1733 to 1833 (Barrie & Jenkins, London 1970, reissued with expanded plates, 1987, 1989). Among the many surviving Spode documents are two shape books dated to about 1820 which contain thumbnail sketches of bone china objects with instructions to throwers and turners about size requirements. One copy is in the Joseph Downes collection at Winterthur Museum, Gardens, and Library, Delaware, USA.Winterthur.org Spode \\"Stone- China\\" Entrance to Spode Pottery Works, Stoke After some early trials Spode perfected a stoneware that came closer to porcelain than any previously, and introduced his \\"Stone-China\\" in 1813. It was light in body, greyish-white and gritty where it was not glazed and approached translucence in the early wares; later Stone-Ware became opaque. Spode pattern books, which record about 75000 patterns, survive from about 1800. In Spode's similar \\"Felspar porcelain\\", introduced on the market in 1821, felspar was an ingredient, substituted for the Cornish stone in his standard bone china body, giving rise to his slightly misleading name \\"Felspar porcelain,\\"\\"Spode Felspar Porcelain\\" is often stamped in underglaze on the bottoms of wares, both in simple typography and in copperplate lettering surrounded by a wreath of thistles and roses.

Snyder, Romantic staffordshire Ceramics (Atglen, Pennsylvania) 1997:8. Spode's \\"Felspar porcelain\\" continued into the Copeland & Garrett phase of the company (1833‚Äì1847).Robert Copeland, Spode 1998: Armorial services were provided for the Honourable East India Company, 1823, and the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, c1824.Examples of both services illustrated in Copeland1998:35 figs 59, 60. Some of the ware employed underglaze blue and iron red with touches of gilding in imitation of \\"Imari porcelain\\" that had been introduced on Spode's bone china in the first decade of the century:Spodes's pattern 967, the most popular imitation of \\"Imari\\" wares, was recorded in 1807. (Copeland :36 fig. 62. the most familiar \\"Tobacco-leaf pattern\\" (2061) continued to be made by Spode's successors, William Taylor Copeland, and then \\"W.T. Copeland & Sons, late Spode\\".  Later forms of the business  Messrs Spode were succeeded in the same business in c. 1833 by Copeland and Garrett, who often used the name Spode in their marks. In particular these are called 'Late Spode' and include productions of the so- called 'Felspar porcelain'. They also produced other kinds of bone china, earthenware, parian, etc. The partnership continued in this form until 1847. Godden 1972, 56‚Äì57. After 1847 the business continued until 1970 as W.T. Copeland and sons, and again the term 'Spode' or 'Late Spode' continued in use alongside the name of Copeland. Under the name 'Spode Ltd' the same factories and business was continued after 1970. In 2006, the business merged with Royal Worcester. The merged company entered administration on 6 November 2008. The brand names and intellectual property were acquired by Portmeirion Group on 23 April 2009. On 23 April 2009, Portmeirion Pottery purchased their rival Royal Worcester and Spode brands, together with some of the stock, after they had been placed into administration the previous November. The purchase did not include Royal Worcester or Spode manufacturing facilities. Many items in Spode's Blue Italian and Woodland ranges are now made at Portmeirion Group's factory in Stoke-on-Trent. In 2012 the Spode Museum Trust opened the Spode Works Visitor Centre in part of the historic Spode factory.

In the 2016 census Mission Beach and surrounding villages had a total population of 3,597 people (Bingil Bay 427, Mission Beach 815, Wongaling Beach 1,245, South Mission Beach 932, Carmoo 178).  Geography  Mission Beach is bounded on the east by the Coral Sea. The popular tourist destination of Dunk Island lies offshore. Today, what were once separate villages have now grown such that they are considered one town, Mission Beach. The villages are, from south to north, Carmoo, South Mission Beach, Wongaling Beach, Mission Beach, Narragon Beach, Bingil Bay, Brookes Beach, Garners Beach, Midgereebar and Maria Creeks. Clump Point () is the northern end of a sandy beach long facing the Coral Sea which runs south to Tam O'Shanter Point in South Mission Beach at the southern end (). History =Djiru= The region has been inhabited for at least the past 5,000 years by a rainforest dwelling people collectively known as the Djiru people. Remains of middens, fish traps, rock-shelter paintings and ceremonial sites are located around Mission Beach and Dunk Island. Djiru people made large wooden swords and built wet-season villages consisting of dome-shaped huts thatched with palm fronds and paperbark. =British exploration= Lieutenant James Cook sailed through the area in 1770, naming Dunk Island. Clump Point () was descriptively named in 1848 by Captain Owen Stanley of the Royal Navy survey ship HMS Rattlesnake. On board was the Cape York Peninsula exploration party led by Edmund Kennedy which was landed to the south of the region to begin their ill-fated overland journey. After the disembarkation of Kennedy's group, Captain Stanley anchored off Dunk Island and he and his crew remained in the vicinity for ten days. They traded with the local Djiru people until a crew member shot at them after being prevented from entering a nearby village. =The shipwreck of the Maria= On 26 February 1872, the brig Maria carrying 75 people of a gold prospecting expedition to New Guinea was wrecked upon Bramble Reef. The survivors escaped the sinking ship on 3 boats and 2 rafts. Two of the boats made it safely to the nearest British settlement of Cardwell, but the other three craft were washed up on the shoreline at and around what is now Mission Beach. Up to ten of these crew members, including the captain, were found to have been murdered by Aboriginal people residing in this region. Lieutenant Sabben of the Royal Navy was sent to recover the captain's boat and find any survivors. Upon reaching the beached boat they were attacked by about 120 Aboriginal men. In resisting the attack, 8 native people were killed. Fearing further attacks, Magistrate Brinsley Sheridan, ordered Sub-Inspector Robert Arthur Johnstone of the Native Police \\"to inflict decisive punishment\\". Johnstone and his troopers were significantly aided by another Royal Navy officer in Captain John Moresby who provided additional armed marines and a large schooner. Moresby described how \\"several unfortunate blacks were shot down by the native troopers, who showed an unrestrained ferocity that disgusted our officers\\". A six-year-old boy was taken during this raid and sent to England by the \\"kind act\\" of Lieutenant Francis Hayter. The boy died there from pneumonia three years later. Johnstone and his troopers, together with armed sailors and volunteer riflemen, scoured the coast from Cardwell north to Cooper Point, searching every Aboriginal camp they came across for any traces of the men. Newspapers reported that Johnstone's detachment of Native Police killed a total of 93 local Aboriginal people in the Maria reprisals. Accusations of Johnstone and others having \\"punished the innocent together with the guilty\\" and partaking in \\"slaughtering whole camps, not only of men, but of women and children\\" even reached the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies in London, Robert Herbert. The claims were dismissed by Lord Normanby, Governor of Queensland, on the grounds that the Aboriginal people of the north \\"are numerous, savage, treacherous, and very commonly cannibals\\". Various localities around Mission Beach were named after entities and events involved in the shipwreck of the Maria including Maria Creek and the Johnstone River. =British settlement= Up until the late 1870s, the area was still considered too dangerous for British settlement and the Djiru were able to maintain their traditional livelihood in a landscape that had the \\"appearance of some wealthy nobleman's estate.\\" Charles Freshney's logging company started to cut down the groves of cedar trees around Clump Point from 1880. They employed Aboriginal people for timber hauling, paying them with tobacco and tools. The first white settlers to establish a landholding in the region were the Cutten brothers (Herbert, Leonard, James and Sidney), who took up their selections in 1886. They built a homestead which they called Bicton (now Bingil Bay), and farmed mangoes, bananas, pineapples, coffee, citrus fruit and coconuts. By 1890, the Cutten brothers were not able to support the remaining Djiru living on what was now their property. The Cuttens threatened to exterminate the Djiru and burnt down their main camp, but kept around 40 people to labour on their plantations. Initially these workers were indentured on government wages but by 1910 the Cuttens were accused of paying their remaining Djiru labourers with rum. The Cuttens starting selling out of the area in 1918 after a cyclone destroyed their plantations. After the Cutten brothers, the Unsworths settled at Narragon Beach, the Garners came and settled at Garners Beach, and the Porter brothers settled at what the locals refer to as Porter's Creek (also called Wongaling Creek) at the south end of North Mission Beach. =Hull River Aboriginal Settlement= In the early 20th century Chinese banana farmers used Aboriginal people as labourers in the Tully River region. Opium addiction and conflict with British settlers resulted in the Queensland government creating an Aboriginal internment centre, the Hull River Aboriginal Settlement, at the present South Mission Beach. John Martin Kenny was appointed superintendent in September 1914. There was no mission in the religious sense; the settlement had characteristics of a penal settlement. Forced removals from other regions swelled the population to around 500 by 1916. Many ran away and about 200 people died there in 1917 during an epidemic. The whole settlement was destroyed in the cyclone of 10 March 1918 and Superintendent Kenny and his daughter were killed by debris. The surviving residents were forcibly moved to a new settlement on Great Palm Island. =Later events= In the late 1920s after the construction of a road from El Arish, the area became a popular camping place. It was known as Mission Beach due to the mistaken belief that the Hull River Aboriginal Settlement previously located in the region was a religious mission. Mission Beach developed into a town during the 1940s and 50s with the Mission Beach Post Office opening on 15 December 1949 and the Mission Beach State School being built in 1953. Demographics In the 2016 census Mission Beach had a population of 815. Education Mission Beach State School opened on 27 January 1953 and is located at Webb Road Wongaling Beach. It is a Prep to Year 6 school and details of the curriculum, facilities and resources can be found on the Mission Beach State School Website. Festivals In September, Mission Beach hosts the annual Cassowary Festival. This festival was created to promote the unique wildlife of the region and to celebrate the community through music, activities and education. Sport The Mission Beach Barracudas football club fields teams that play in the local Johnstone River Football Association league. Tourism Mission Beach is now a thriving tourist town that has been able to maintain its small town feel. One reason for this is that the town is spread out along a thin strip of land between the ocean and the hills and farmland behind. This has spread out a large tourism market, and the village doesn't feel as busy as one might expect. The beach is flanked by green mountains rising just a short distance inland, and provides views out to the Family Islands. Close to shore at Mission Beach lies a shallow reef; during very low tides portions of this reef are exposed. The reef runs from the mouth of Porter's Creek at the south end of North Mission Beach almost to Clump Point, and is a popular fishing spot. Southern cassowary Surrounded by World Heritage rainforest on one side and the World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef on the other, Mission Beach is home to many wildlife species, most notable is the cassowary. This large flightless bird can be found in the rainforest surrounding the area but appears to be thriving in spite of land clearing, traffic and predators such as wild dogs and feral pigs. Much of the area is part of the Coastal Wet Tropics Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for the conservation of lowland tropical rainforest birds.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Coastal Wet Tropics. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 16 December 2011. Mission Beach is also the mainland gateway to Dunk Island, with water-taxis shuttling day-trippers out to the island. Like many other small Australian towns, Mission Beach has built a monument to its most famous characteristic. The big cassowary, standing 5 metres high, can be found at the Wongaling Beach shopping complex. In 2019, Mayfair 101, an Australian-based investment consortium, bought 200 properties in Mission Beach as well as nearby Dunk Island with the view to transform the area into a \\"tourism mecca\\". By August 2020, Dunk Island had been repossessed by the former owners, and investigations by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission led to the freezing of assets of 14 property trusts Mayfair 101 had used to buy land in and around Mission Beach. Major Cyclones =The Innisfail cyclone (unnamed), 1918= On 10 March 1918, a category 5 cyclone hit the Innisfail area, killing at least 100 people in the region. A storm surge in the Mission Beach area swept hundreds of metres inland leaving debris 7m up in some trees. This cyclone destroyed the Hull River Aboriginal Settlement, killing the superintendent, his daughter and other residents. =Cyclone Larry, 2006= On 20 March 2006, Cyclone Larry crossed the coast in between Mission Beach and Innisfail. In addition to structural damage to property, Cyclone Larry also had a tremendous impact on the rainforest and animals of the region. A shortage of rainforest fruit saw cassowaries seeking food in built up areas and, unfortunately, a number were hit and killed by cars. =Cyclone Yasi, 2011= On 3 February 2011, the eyewall of Severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi crossed the coast near Mission Beach. Wind gusts estimated up to , leaving behind significant damage. A storm surge estimated to have reached destroyed several structures along the coast and pushed up to inland. Most of the beach had lost its sand and all of the towns structures were damaged to some degree, with many houses completely destroyed. There were no reports of fatalities or injuries in Mission Beach. Agriculture The Mission Beach area also supports a sizeable agricultural industry, particularly the cultivation of sugar and bananas. Boutique wineries specialising in tropical fruit wines can also be found in Mission Beach and nearby Kurrimine Beach.

Best known for his UK-set novels Red Riding Quartet (1999‚Äì2002), GB84 (2004), The Damned Utd (2006), and Red or Dead (2013), Peace was named one of the Best of Young British Novelists by Granta in their 2003 list. Biography David Peace was born in Dewsbury and grew up in Ossett, West Yorkshire. He was educated at Batley Grammar School, Wakefield College and Manchester Polytechnic, which he left in 1991 to go to Istanbul to teach English. He moved to Tokyo in 1994 and returned to the UK in 2009. He went back to Tokyo in 2011, because he found it hard to write in Britain.David Peace, speaking to Adrian Goldberg on Radio 5 Live, 13 August 2013 He has lectured in the Department of Contemporary Literature at the University of Tokyo since his return to Tokyo in 2011. Red-Riding Quartet The Red-Riding Quartet comprises the novels Nineteen Seventy-Four (1999), Nineteen Seventy-Seven (2000), Nineteen Eighty (2001) and Nineteen Eighty- Three (2002). The books deal with police corruption, and are set against a backdrop of the Yorkshire Ripper murders between 1975 and 1980. They feature several recurring characters. Red Riding, a three-part TV adaptation of the series, aired on Channel 4 in the UK in 2009. The cast includes Sean Bean, Andrew Garfield and Rebecca Hall. GB84 Peace followed the quartet with GB84 (2004). This is a fictional portrayal of the year of the UK miners' strike (1984‚Äì1985). It describes the insidious workings of the British government and MI5, the coalfield battles, the struggle for influence in government and the dwindling powers of the National Union of Mineworkers. The book was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for literature in 2005. The Damned Utd, Red or Dead He followed GB84 with another fact-based fictional piece, The Damned Utd (2006), which is based on Brian Clough's fateful 44-day spell in 1974 as manager of Leeds United Football Club. Entering the mind of the man who many regard as a football genius, Peace tells the story of a man characterised by a fear of failure and a hunger for success. Peace has described it as an \\"occult history of Leeds United\\". Former footballer and manager Johnny Giles threatened to sue Peace for The Damned Utd as to what he perceived were gross untruths in the book. As part of an out of court settlement, the publisher of The Damned Utd, Faber and Faber, agreed to remove from any future editions the references perceived by Giles as damaging and untrue. Peace is a supporter of Huddersfield Town, a club who are a local rival of Leeds United, and the team that Leeds United played in Clough's first and last games in charge of the club. The Damned Utd has been made into a film entitled The Damned United, with Michael Sheen playing Brian Clough. Peace's novel Red or Dead, about Bill Shankly and the rise of Liverpool Football Club, was published in August 2013 and was shortlisted for the Goldsmiths Prize that year. Faber & Faber, London, 2013. Tokyo Trilogy Tokyo Year Zero (2007) follows the investigations of a Tokyo detective in the aftermath of Japan's defeat in World War II. It is based on the true story of serial killer Yoshio Kodaira. It is the first of Peace's novels to be set outside of Yorkshire and forms the first part of a trio of books on the U.S. military occupation of Japan. The second book, published in August 2009, is called Occupied City, a Rashomon-like telling of the Hirasawa Sadamichi case in Tokyo in 1948. The final volume of the Tokyo trilogy will be published in 2020. As a separate stand alone novel, but set in Japan, Patient X, was published in 2018. Subtitled The Case-Book of Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa, it follows the life of author Akutagawa from his childhood to his suicide in 1927, including his witnessing of the Great Kant≈ç earthquake that devastated most of Tokyo and much of the surrounding region in 1923. Plans Peace's plans include UKDK, about the changing face of UK politics, set around the fall of Harold Wilson and rise of Margaret Thatcher, and titles possibly including The Yorkshire Rippers and Nineteen Forty Seven. He has also begun preparing a novel about Geoffrey Boycott and his relationship with Yorkshire County Cricket Club and England. He intends to stop writing novels after his twelfth novel but has joked he may publish a collection of his \\"very bad poetry\\".

She was one of the most famous ships of the period, taking part in several of the most important naval battles of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. In 1811 she was wrecked off the coast of Jutland with the loss of almost her entire crew. Career During the American War of Independence, Defence served with the Channel Fleet, seeing action at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent in 1780. She was sent out to India in early 1782 as part of a squadron of five ships under Commodore Sir Richard Bickerton, arriving too late for the battles of that year. But in 1783 she took part in the last battle of the war, at Cuddalore. She returned to England at the end of 1785. She was then laid up during the years of peace until the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. Recommissioned into the Channel Fleet under Captain James Gambier, she fought at the Glorious First of June in 1794, distinguishing herself in action against Mucius and Tourville, and becoming one of only two British ships to be completely dismasted in the battle. After repairs, she was sent to the Mediterranean, joining Admiral William Hotham in time to take part in the Battle of Hyeres in July. In 1798 she returned to the Mediterranean under Captain John Peyton, taking part in the Battle of the Nile in August. On 1 July 1800, Defence, , and the hired armed cutter Lord Nelson were in Bourneuf Bay when they sent in their boats to attack a French convoy at √éle de Noirmoutier. The British destroyed the French ship Therese (of 20 guns), a lugger (12 guns), two schooners (6 guns each) and a cutter (6 guns), of unknown names. The cutting out party also burned some 15 merchant vessels loaded with corn and supplies for the French fleet at Brest. However, in this enterprise, 92 officers and men out of the entire party of 192 men, fell prisoners to the French when their boats became stranded. Lord Nelson had contributed no men to the attacking force and so had no casualties. In 1801, Defence sailed to the Baltic under Captain Lord Henry Paulet with Admiral Hyde Parker's fleet. She was present at the Battle of Copenhagen, but did not see action as she was part of the reserve under Parker. In 1805 she saw action again at the Battle of Trafalgar, where under Captain George Johnstone Hope, she captured the San Ildefonso and fought the , suffering 36 casualties. Loss The beach near Thorsminde She ran aground on 24 December 1811 off the west coast of Jutland, Denmark. She was under the command of Captain D. Atkins and in the company of , under Rear-admiral Robert Carthew Reynolds, and , when a hurricane and heavy seas came up. St George was jury-rigged and so Atkins refused to leave her without the Admiral's permission. As a result, both were wrecked near Ringk√∏bing. Cressy did not ask for permission and so avoided wrecking. The last cruise Defence lost all but 14 of her crew of 597 men and boys, including her captain. St George too lost almost her entire crew, including the admiral. Most of the bodies that came ashore were buried in the sand dunes of Thorsminde, which have been known ever since as \\"Dead Mens Dunes\\".

It was a strategically significant defeat of Allied forces by Japan in the Pacific campaign of World War II, with the Japanese invasion force quickly overwhelming the small Australian garrison, the majority of which was either killed or captured. Hostilities on the neighbouring island of New Ireland are usually considered to be part of the same battle. Rabaul was significant because of its proximity to the Japanese territory of the Caroline Islands, site of a major Imperial Japanese Navy base on Truk. Following the capture of the port of Rabaul, Japanese forces turned it into a major base and proceeded to land on mainland New Guinea, advancing toward Port Moresby. Heavy fighting followed along the Kokoda Track, and around Milne Bay, before the Japanese were eventually pushed back towards Buna‚ÄìGona by early 1943. As part of Operation Cartwheel, throughout 1943‚Äì1945, Allied forces later sought to isolate the Japanese garrison on Rabaul, rather than capturing it, largely using air power to do so, with US and Australian ground forces pursuing a limited campaign in western New Britain during this time. By the end of the war, there was still a sizeable garrison at Rabaul, with large quantities of equipment that were subsequently abandoned. In the aftermath, it took the Allies over two years to repatriate the captured Japanese soldiers, while clean up efforts continued past the late 1950s. Many relics including ships, aircraft and weapons, as well as abandoned positions and tunnels, remain in the area. Prelude Rabaul lies on the eastern end of the island of New Britain. At the time of the battle, the town was the capital of the Australian-administered Territory of New Guinea, having been captured from the Germans in 1914. In March 1941, the Australians despatched a small garrison to the region, as tensions with Japan heightened. The small Australian Army garrison in New Britain was built around Lieutenant Colonel Howard Carr's 700-strong 2/22nd Battalion, an Australian Imperial Force (AIF) infantry battalion. This battalion formed part of Lark Force, which eventually numbered 1,400 men and was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John Scanlan. The force also included personnel from a local Militia unit, the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles (NGVR), a coastal defence battery, an anti-aircraft battery, an anti-tank battery and a detachment of the 2/10th Field Ambulance. The 2/22nd Battalion Band‚Äîwhich was also included in Lark Force‚Äîis perhaps the only military unit ever to have been entirely recruited from the ranks of the Salvation Army. A commando unit, the 130-strong 2/1st Independent Company, was detached to garrison the nearby island of New Ireland. Map depicting eastern New Guinea and New Britain Throughout 1941, the Allies had planned to build Rabaul up as a \\"secure fleet anchorage\\" with plans to establish a radar station and a strong defensive minefield; however, these plans were ultimately shelved. Allied planners later determined that they did not have the capacity to expand the garrison around Rabaul, nor was the naval situation conducive to reinforcing it should the garrison come under attack. Nevertheless, the decision was made that the garrison would remain in place to hold Rabaul as a forward observation post. The main tasks of the garrison were protection of Vunakanau, the main Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) airfield near Rabaul, and the nearby flying boat anchorage in Simpson Harbour, which were important for the surveillance of Japanese movements in the region. However, the RAAF contingent, under Wing Commander John Lerew, had little offensive capability, with only 10 lightly armed CAC Wirraway training aircraft and four Lockheed Hudson light bombers from No. 24 Squadron. For the Japanese, Rabaul was important because of its proximity to the Caroline Islands, which was the site of a major Imperial Japanese Navy base on Truk. The capture of New Britain offered them a deep water harbour and airfields to provide protection to Truk and also to interdict Allied lines of communication between the United States and Australia. Following the capture of Guam, the South Seas Detachment, under Major General Tomitaro Horii, was tasked with capturing Kavieng and Rabaul, as part of \\"Operation R\\". Japanese planning began with aerial reconnaissance of the town, which sought to identify the dispositions of the defending troops. Planners, who had been flown from Guam to Truk, determined three possible schemes of manoeuvre based on these dispositions: a landing near Kokop, aimed at establishing a beachhead; a landing on the north coast of Rabaul, followed by a drive on Rabaul from behind the main defences; or a multi-pronged landing focused on capturing the airfields and centre of the town. They eventually settled upon the third option. For the invasion, the Japanese established a brigade group based on the 55th Division. Its main combat units were the 144th Infantry Regiment, which consisted of a headquarters unit, three infantry battalions, an artillery company, signals unit, and a munitions squad, as well as a few platoons from the 55th Cavalry Regiment, a battalion from the 55th Mountain Artillery Regiment and a company from the 55th Engineer Regiment. These forces would be supported by a large naval task force, and landing operations would be preceded by a heavy aerial campaign aimed at destroying Allied air assets in region, so that they could not interfere with the landing operations. Battle Most civilian men were forced to stay in Rabaul but women who were not necessary to the defence of the base were evacuated in December 1941, shortly before Japanese air raids began. Starting on 4 January 1942, Rabaul came under attack by large numbers of Japanese carrier-based aircraft. After the odds facing the Australians mounted significantly, the RAAF commander, Lerew, signalled RAAF HQ in Melbourne with the Latin motto \\"Nos Morituri Te Salutamus\\" (\\"we who are about to die salute you\\"), the phrase uttered by gladiators in ancient Rome before entering combat. On 14 January, the Japanese force embarked at Truk and began steaming towards Rabaul as part of a naval task force, which consisted of two aircraft carriers‚Äî and ‚Äîseven cruisers, 14 destroyers, and numerous smaller vessels and submarines under the command of Vice Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue. On 20 January, over 100 Japanese aircraft attacked Rabaul in multiple waves. Eight Wirraways attacked and in the ensuing fighting three RAAF planes were shot down, two crash-landed, and another was damaged. Six Australian aircrew were killed in action and five wounded. One of the attacking Japanese bombers was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. As a result of the intense air attacks, Australian coastal artillery was destroyed and Australian infantry were withdrawn from Rabaul itself. The following day, an RAAF Catalina flying boat crew located the invasion fleet off Kavieng, and its crew managed to send a signal before being shot down. Japanese fleet to be employed in the invasion of Rabaul, photographed by an RAAF Hudson over Truk on 9 January 1942 As the Australian ground troops took up positions along the western shore of Blanche Bay where they prepared to meet the landing, the remaining RAAF elements, consisting of two Wirraways and one Hudson, were withdrawn to Lae. Once the aircraft had departed with a number of wounded, the Australians destroyed the airfield. The bombing continued around Rabaul on 22 January and early that morning a Japanese force of between 3,000 and 4,000 troops landed just off New Ireland and waded ashore in deep water filled with dangerous mudpools. The 2/1st Independent Company had been dispersed around the island and the Japanese took the main town of Kavieng without opposition; after a sharp fight around the airfield the commandos fell back towards the Sook River. That night, the invasion fleet approached Rabaul and before dawn on 23 January, the South Seas Force entered Simpson Harbour and a force of around 5,000 troops, mainly from the 144th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Colonel Masao Kusunose, began to land on New Britain. A series of desperate actions followed near the beaches around Simpson Harbour, Keravia Bay and Raluana Point as the Australians attempted to turn back the attack. The 3rd Battalion, 144th Infantry Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Kuwada Ishiro, was held up at Vulcan Beach by a mixed company of Australians from the 2/22nd and the NGVR, but elsewhere the other two battalions of the South Seas Force were able to land at unguarded locations and began moving inland. Within hours, Lakunai airfield had been captured by the Japanese force. Assessing the situation as hopeless, Scanlan ordered \\"every man for himself\\", and Australian soldiers and civilians split into small groups, up to company size, and retreated through the jungle, moving along the north and south coasts. During the fighting on 23 January, the Australians lost two officers and 26 other ranks killed in action. Only the RAAF had made evacuation plans. Although initially ordered to turn his ground staff into infantrymen in a last-ditch effort to defend the island, Lerew insisted that they be evacuated and organised for them to be flown out by flying boat and his one remaining Hudson. In the days that followed the capture of Rabaul, the Japanese began mopping up operations, starting on 24 January. Australian soldiers remained at large in the interior of New Britain for many weeks, but Lark Force had made no preparations for guerrilla warfare on New Britain. Without supplies, their health and military effectiveness declined. Leaflets posted by Japanese patrols or dropped from planes stated in English, \\"you can find neither food nor way of escape in this island and you will only die of hunger unless you surrender\\". The Japanese commander, Horii, tasked the 3rd Battalion, 144th Infantry Regiment with searching the southern part of the Gazelle Peninsula and securing the remaining Australians. Over 1,000 Australian soldiers were captured or surrendered during the following weeks after the Japanese landed a force at Gasmata, on New Britain's south coast, on 9 February, severing the Australians' line of retreat. Following this, the Japanese reorganised their forces, occupying a line along the Keravat River, to prevent possible counterattacks. Aftermath =Casualties= From mainland New Guinea, some civilians and individual officers from the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit organised unofficial rescue missions to New Britain, and between March and May about 450 troops and civilians were evacuated by sea. Notwithstanding these efforts, Allied losses, particularly in relation to personnel captured, were very high and casualties during the fighting for Rabaul in early 1942 were heavily in favour of the Japanese. The Allies lost six aircrew killed and five wounded, along with 28 soldiers killed in action, and over 1,000 captured. Against this, the Japanese lost only 16 killed and 49 wounded. Of the over 1,000 Australian soldiers taken prisoner, around 160 were massacred on or about 4 February 1942 in four separate incidents around Tol and Waitavalo. Six men survived these killings and later described what had happened to a Court of Inquiry. The Australian government concluded the prisoners were marched into the jungle near Tol Plantation in small groups and were then bayoneted by Japanese soldiers. At the nearby Waitavalo Plantation, another group of Australian prisoners were shot. The Allies later placed responsibility for the incident on Masao Kusunose, the commanding officer of the 144th Infantry Regiment, but in late 1946 he starved himself to death before he could stand trial. At least 800 soldiers and 200 civilian prisoners of war‚Äîmost of them Australian‚Äîlost their lives on 1 July 1942, when the ship on which they were being transported from Rabaul to Japan, the Montevideo Maru, was sunk off the north coast of Luzon by the U.S. submarine . =Subsequent operations= According to Japanese author Kengoro Tanaka, the operation to capture Rabaul was the only operation of the New Guinea campaign that was completely successful for the Japanese. Following the capture of Rabaul, the Japanese quickly repaired the damage to Rabaul's airfield and Rabaul became the biggest Japanese base in New Guinea, and the lynchpin to their defences in the region. The Australians tried to restrict Rabaul's development soon after its capture by a bombing counter-attack in March. The Japanese eventually extended their control across New Britain, establishing airfields at Cape Gloucester on the island's western tip and several small outposts along the coast to provide stop-over points for small boats travelling between Rabaul and New Guinea. Meanwhile, a handful of Lark Force members remained at large on New Britain and New Ireland and, in conjunction with the local islanders, conducted guerrilla operations against the Japanese, serving mainly as coast watchers, providing information of Japanese shipping movements. For the Japanese, the capture of Rabaul was followed with further operations on mainland New Guinea, beginning with operations to capture the Salamaua‚ÄìLae region beginning in March 1942. Throughout 1942 and into early 1943, the Allies and Japanese fought along the Kokoda Track, at Milne Bay and around Buna‚ÄìGona as the Japanese sought to advance south towards Port Moresby. By mid-1943, the tide turned in favour of the Allies, who began an offensive in the Pacific, aimed at advancing north through New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. By late November 1943 the Japanese force in Rabaul had been reduced by airpower, with a large raid being mounted from the aircraft carriers and on 5 November. According to author Eric Larrabee, \\"thereafter no Japanese heavy ships ever came to Rabaul.\\" Allied planners had considered capturing Rabaul, but they eventually settled on isolating it and bypassing it as part of Operation Cartwheel. In December 1943, U.S. Marines and Army soldiers landed in western New Britain at Arawe and Cape Gloucester. Subsequently, Allied operations on New Britain gradually restricted the Japanese force to the area around Rabaul. In November 1944, the Australians returned to the island when advanced elements of the 5th Division landed at Jacquinot Bay on the south coast, and relieved the US 40th Infantry Division. The Australians then conducted a number of other landings around the island as they conducted a limited advance north, securing a line across the base of the Gazelle Peninsula between Wide Bay and Open Bay. After this, they sought to isolate and contain the main Japanese forces around Rabaul. When Japan surrendered in August 1945, there were still around 69,000 Japanese troops in Rabaul. Large quantities of equipment were subsequently abandoned around Rabaul after the war, and it took over two years for the Allies to repatriate the Japanese garrison that was captured after Japan surrendered. In the late 1950s, Japanese salvage companies began work to salvage many of the ship wrecks around Rabaul. However, many abandoned positions, tunnels, and equipment relics such as aircraft and weapons can still be found in the area.

He was the frontman and lead guitarist of Dirty Pretty Things, and in 2010 debuted a solo album. In 2014 he announced the creation of his new band, The Jackals. Early life Carl Bar√¢t was born in Basingstoke, north Hampshire, England on 6 June 1978, and spent most of his childhood in nearby Whitchurch, Hampshire. In a September 2004 interview with Blender Magazine, Bar√¢t mentioned having a French, Russian and Polish ethnic background. As a youth, Bar√¢t divided his time between his divorced parents. His father, a former artist, worked in an armaments factory, and his mother, Chrissie, was part of the commune-dwelling counterculture and a member of peace groups such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Bar√¢t spent part of his childhood living with his mother on a commune in Somerset. He has one sister, actress-turned-singer Lucie Bar√¢t, who played Helen's handmaiden in the 2004 film Troy, founded publishing house and artistic organization Little Episodes, and is currently the lead singer of The Au Revoirs. He also has three half-siblings, one step brother and one step sister. In 1996, Bar√¢t was studying for a drama degree at Brunel University at the campus in St. Margarets, Twickenham. Although he dropped out halfway through, during his time he became well-acquainted with Pete Doherty's sister, Amy-Jo and through her, Bar√¢t met Doherty. They soon developed an intense friendship based on a shared interest in music and songwriting. Bar√¢t and Doherty also developed a shared mythology in which they were on a ship called 'The Albion' sailing to 'Arcadia'. After both dropped out of university, they formed The Libertines. The band in its final incarnation included bassist John Hassall and drummer Gary Powell. Bar√¢t and Doherty were co-frontmen, sharing songwriting, vocal and guitar duties. Career =The Libertines= The Libertines' first album, Up the Bracket, was released in 2002 to critical acclaim. The band appeared on the cover of NME before the album was released and rapidly rose to fame in the UK. This was due in part, to their volatile stage performances, which were characterised by intense bouts of mic-sharing and play-fighting between Bar√¢t and Doherty. This paralleled their relationship, which by 2003 had progressed to verging on dysfunctional and abusive, with Bar√¢t and Doherty being equally competitive and possessive with each other. Referring to their relationship in a January 2010 interview, Bar√¢t said, '...it's a deep love. Deep love does funny things to people'. In 2003, Doherty's addiction to heroin and crack cocaine led Bar√¢t to ask him not to participate in the band's next tour. When Doherty discovered that The Libertines had left without him to perform in Japan he broke into Bar√¢t's Mayfair flat and stole various items, including an antique guitar and an NME Award. He was convicted and sentenced to six months in prison (this sentence was later shortened to two months). Bar√¢t warmly welcomed Doherty back to The Libertines on the day of his release, and they later performed an impromptu \\"Freedom Gig\\" at the Tap 'n' Tin club in Chatham, Kent on 8 October 2003. A photograph of the gig, taken by Roger Sargent, adorns The Libertines' self-titled second album, The Libertines, and the cover of Sargent's and Anthony Thornton's book, The Libertines Bound Together. Doherty's drug addiction continued while the band worked on their second album (the aforementioned The Libertines) in 2004, which strained his relationship with Bar√¢t. Bodyguards were needed in the recording sessions, allegedly to prevent Bar√¢t and Doherty from physically assaulting each other (though this is claimed to be an exaggeration of the press in Bound Together) and to keep Doherty's hangers-on away from him. Before the release of the album in 2004, relations between Bar√¢t and Doherty reached a breaking point and Doherty was once again prevented from performing with the band before addressing his addictions. Doherty did not take the ultimatum well, especially as The Libertines continued touring without him to fulfill contractual obligations. Doherty admitted in a September 2005 interview that he had not spoken to any of his former bandmates since then. What was intended as a short leave of absence turned into something more permanent, as Doherty formed a new band, Babyshambles, and the Libertines officially disbanded after their final gig in December 2004. On 15 May 2009, Bar√¢t, Doherty and Powell of the Libertines played on stage together for the first time since the split in 2004. The Libertines (minus Denmark-residing bassist John Hassall) came together for a tribute gig for their late promoter, Johnny Sedassy. The six song set, which included \\"What a Waster\\", \\"Up the Bracket\\" and \\"Death on the Stairs\\", was played after Babyshambles appeared on stage. Bar√¢t explained that the show was a 'one off', although he admitted that the likelihood of more shows could not be ruled out. Bar√¢t also expressed his desire to get on stage with Doherty again, although perhaps not until 2010. Powell also confirmed that he'd be interested in a full reunion, although he wished to \\"readdress old ghosts first\\".[NME, 30 May 2009, Page 13] The Libertines delighted their fans by announcing that year that they would be headline artists at the 2010 Reading and Leeds Festivals. Their set and the characteristic chemistry between the pair, was for many people one of the highlights of the weekend. In April 2014 the Libertines announced they would again reform for a show at London's Hyde Park. In November 2014 the band signed a record deal with Virgin EMI Records, and released their third album, Anthems for Doomed Youth, on 11 September 2015, leading to Headline slots at Reading and Leeds, T in the Park as well as a surprise slot at Glastonbury. They toured across 2016 and 2017 finishing with a tour across the seaside. =Dirty Pretty Things= On 15 September 2005, it was announced that Bar√¢t was forming a new band. His bandmates included former Libertines drummer Gary Powell; Anthony Rossomando, who filled in as guitarist following Doherty's departure from the group; and Didz Hammond, formerly of The Cooper Temple Clause, on bass. It was later announced that the band's name was \\"Dirty Pretty Things\\". The group played their first shows in Italy and Paris, France in October 2005, before recording their debut album in November 2005 in Los Angeles, California. This was produced by Dave Sardy, who has also worked with Supergrass, The Dandy Warhols, Jet, Marilyn Manson, Rolling Stones, and Oasis. The album ‚Äì entitled Waterloo to Anywhere ‚Äì was released on 8 May 2006 in the UK and 8 August 2006 in the US. Their first studio recorded demo, \\"Bang Bang You're Dead\\", was released on their website in the form of a flash video. Its sound has been likened to that of the early Libertines', mixing punk and reggae influences. This song was released as their debut single on 24 April 2006 and reached number 5 in the UK single chart. This coincided with the latter part of their first tour of the United Kingdom, which spanned from 26 February to 24 May 2006. Their debut album, Waterloo to Anywhere, was released on 8 May 2006, and reached number 3 in the UK album chart. They have since released \\"Deadwood\\" and \\"Wondering\\". The band were forced to postpone their Real Fits fundraiser gig, which had been set to take place at the London Hackney Round Chapel on 20 June 2008 as Bar√¢t was rushed to hospital on 17 June with acute pancreatitis. He was released from hospital on 22 June. The band released their new single, \\"Tired of England\\", on 23 June 2008, and their album, Romance at Short Notice, a week later on 30 June. Their album failed to chart highly despite heavy touring schedules. Powell wrote in the band's message board that it had been a difficult year. On 1 October 2008, Dirty Pretty Things split up, though they finished their final tour which began in Glasgow on 4 October and ended in London on 20 December. =Solo work and contributions= In 2005, Bar√¢t modelled for clothing brand J. Lindeberg, along with Juliette Lewis. In 2008, Tim Burgess stated that he and Bar√¢t had a supergroup The Chavs and planned to record their debut album in August that year. A release never happened. Bar√¢t toured as a solo artist with Glasvegas, performing with them at Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations on 31 December 2008, and at the Popscene in San Francisco on 8 January 2009. On 14 January 2009, Bar√¢t supported Glasvegas with a solo show during their gig at the Los Angeles Troubadour . Bar√¢t played his first headline solo shows on 6 and 7 March 2009 at the Wakefield Escobar. He also played at the KU Bar in Stockton-on-Tees on 8 March. On 9 June 2009, Bar√¢t debuted two new songs, \\"So Long\\" and \\"Monday Morning\\" at a solo show at Dunfermline's Carnegie Hall. On 2 September, Bar√¢t confirmed his intentions to release a solo album. Bar√¢t also produced the debut EP \\"Scapegoat\\" of London-based singer-songwriter Kieran Leonard which was released in October 2009. He released his self-titled, first solo album on 4 October 2010. In an interview with C.B.Liddell of Metropolis magazine he described the album as \\"the first album I've done that is kind of introspective rather than escapist.\\" In the same interview, he also talked about \\"stepping away from big loud guitars\\" as the album is stylistically more diverse and less rock-oriented than previous work. The release of Bar√¢t's first solo album also coincided with the release of Threepenny Memoir: The Lives of a Libertine, an autobiography documenting his years in The Libertines and Dirty Pretty Things. In January 2013 Bar√¢t announced that guitarist Johnny Marr (formerly of The Smiths) and drummer Andy Burrows (formerly of Razorlight and We Are Scientists) would feature on his second solo album, due for release in 2013. Bar√¢t revealed demo versions of tracks 'War of the Roses' and 'Victory Gin' from his second solo effort online. Also in 2013, Bar√¢t wrote the track \\"The dark, it comes\\" for French singer Vanessa Paradis' album Love Songs, on which they duet. He is part of the supergroup The Bottletop Band with Matt Helders (Arctic Monkeys), Andy Nicholson (Arctic Monkeys), Drew McConnell (Babyshambles) and Gruff Rhys (Super Furry Animals). The band's single, \\"The Fall of Rome\\", was released in December 2010. In 2014, Bar√¢t contributed the song \\"Love Is Not on Trial\\", co-written with Davey Ray Moor, for Marc Almond's album The Dancing Marquis. He also contributed vocals and guitar to the track. =Carl Bar√¢t and the Jackals= In August 2013, Bar√¢t announced that his second solo album was complete and he had finished recording it with Joby Ford of The Bronx. He expressed that it was a return to guitar orientated rock stating \\"It would seem that my relationship with my guitar is all patched up.\\" Later he said that he wouldn't release the new material until he'd formed a new band. In early 2014, Bar√¢t announced that he would search for a new band online via Facebook. From over 1000 applications for the positions of rhythm guitarist, drummer and bass guitar, Billy Tessio, Jay Bone and Adam Claxton were chosen, respectively. The band was named The Jackals, and their first live concert was on 15 May 2014 in London's XOYO. On 16 February 2015, Bar√¢t's previously recorded material was released through Cooking Vinyl with small changes, as the debut album of Carl Bar√¢t and The Jackals under the title Let It Reign. It has a score of 67 on review aggregator Metacritic, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". =Acting and TV= In 2005, Bar√¢t and his friend, Adam Green of The Moldy Peaches appeared in a documentary following the pair on a night out in London. On 7 July 2006, Bar√¢t announced that he would become the fifth mentor in the Road to V competition, which involved a UK search for the best unsigned music talent in the UK, with the winner opening V Festival in either Chelmsford or Staffordshire. In 2008, he acted in the British film Telstar, in the role of Rock'n'Roll singer Gene Vincent. The film premiered at the London Film Festival on 25 October 2008 and was released on 19 June 2009. He also featured in an advertisement for BBC Two's The Culture Show, being asked about British culture. A longer version of his interview can be found on the Culture Show website. In May 2009 Bar√¢t featured as himself in a pilot episode for Svengali, alongside former manager Alan McGee and Welsh actor Jonathan Owen, and went on to appear as himself in the film version of Svengali (2013), directed by John Hardwick. On 25 August 2009, a short video entitled \\"Two British Dudes\\" featuring Bar√¢t and fellow musician Har Mar Superstar was released on crappyholidays.net. In January 2010, he appeared in the stage play Fool For Love alongside actress Sadie Frost. The play ran until March 2010 at Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, London. Bar√¢t also narrated a new artist documentary, Mark Donne's The Rime of the Modern Mariner. The film had its world premiere at St Anne's Church in Limehouse, East London, during the ninth East End Film Festival. Bar√¢t's former Dirty Pretty Things bandmate Anthony Rossomando composed the score for the film. Bar√¢t made his opera debut in 2012, as Nero in Pop'pea at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet in Paris; the show was a rock adaptation of Il Nerone. In the same year he played the role of Gavin Metcalf in Dan Turner's film The Man Inside, and had a cameo appearance on the BBC Three TV series Dead Boss. Personal life In 2005, Bar√¢t underwent surgery to remove a tumour behind his ear and spent several weeks recovering from the operation. The tumour and resulting surgery left the singer partially deaf. Bar√¢t's girlfriend, Edie Langley, gave birth to the couple's first child, a boy named Eli on 9 December 2010. Their second son, Ramone, was born on 26 August 2014. Bar√¢t lives with his family in Muswell Hill, north London. In 2012, Bar√¢t was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Winchester for his contribution to the arts.

He now performs with his own band The April Rainers. Previously, he formed the band Yeti. Early life He has said that when he discovered The Beatles at age 13 was the first time he fell in love. He went on to buy their entire discography in chronological order. The Libertines Hassall attended Highgate School, where he was classmates with Johnny Borrell of Razorlight. It is reported Borrell was actually part of the band's line up as bass player before Hassall; another band member was quoted saying he left because he could not keep up with a song they were practising (allegedly 'Horrorshow', a song from the band's Up The Bracket ‚Äì their first album). Hassall joined a band and ended up playing bass. He played in various bands for a few years, but none of them worked out until he met Pete Doherty. Doherty and Carl Bar√¢t had already founded the Libertines, but were in need of a bassist and drummer. It is said that Doherty was intrigued by Hassall not only for his talent but because he had 'proper' equipment. To play the drums on their first recording session, the trio hired Paul Dufour. Hassall was hired to rejoin them on bass when they were signed by Rough Trade in late 2001. He continued to play with the band until they disbanded at the end of 2004. The band has since reformed and was a \\"Special Guest\\" at the Reading/Leeds Festival on 28 August 2010. According to both Bar√¢t and Doherty, The Libertines plan to play live at Hyde Park in London on 5 July 2014 probably with some new material which they may possibly record in the future. From 2015 to 2020, John Hassall toured with the Libertines, promoting their third LP: Anthems for Doomed Youth. In the deluxe version of the album, there's a song called Over It Again where Hassall acts as the lead singer. Hassall has also formed a new band, The April Rainers in Aarhus Denmark, where he lives with his Danish wife Line Hassall Thomsen. After a number of Scandinavian gigs and support slots on Pete Doherty's Eudaimonia tour, the Rainers played a series of headlining gigs in England. The band's much delayed debut album Wheels to Idyll was released in March 2017, following single releases and videos for \\"Given Time\\",\\"Intercity 125\\", \\"Whether Girl\\" and \\"Mosey Through Your Mind\\", the latter being directed by Libertines collaborator Roger Sargent.

He received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he ran for the Florida Gators track and field team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Southeastern Conference (SEC) competition from 1986 to 1989. At Florida, Mitchell was coached by Joe Walker. Mitchell placed fourth in the 100 meters race at the 1988 Summer Olympics and missed a probable gold medal in the 4 x 100 meters relay race, because the American team was disqualified in the early heats, after the baton pass between teammates Calvin Smith and Lee McNeill was completed outside the exchange zone.

At the World Championships, Mitchell was again a member of the American 4 x 100 meters relay team, in which he set a new world record of 37.50 in the final. Mitchell also won a bronze medal in the individual 100 meters race, just 0.01 seconds shy of the world record.

At the Barcelona Olympics, Mitchell ran his third world record in 4 x 100 meters relay of 37.40 and won again a bronze medal in the 100 meters race. At the 1993 World Championships, Mitchell won his third bronze at the international championships in individual 100 meters and his third gold in relay event with a world record, as this time the American team equaled their own world record of 37.40. Mitchell won a gold medal in 100 meters at the 1994 Goodwill Games, but injured himself in the heats of 100 -meters at the 1995 World Championships.

His personal best for the 100 metres was 9.91 seconds, set in Tokyo on 25 August 1991 in the World Athletics Championships final. Personal life Mitchell is married to Damu Cherry-Mitchell, an Olympian in the 100-meter hurdles, and has four children. He coaches with the Montverde Academy as well as with his own club, Star Athletics. Montvede Academy has gone on record saying they are not bothered by Mitchell's extensive drug past. Students range from high-schoolers to Olympic hopefuls. Doping history In 1998, Mitchell was banned by International Association of Athletics Federations for two years after a test showed high levels of testosterone. They did not accept his defense of \\"five bottles of beer and sex with his wife at least four times... it was her birthday, the lady deserved a treat.\\" Mitchell made his final international appearance at the 2001 World Championships, where his team finished first in the 4 x 100 meters relay, but was subsequently disqualified because of BALCO scandal involvement by a teammate. On May 1, 2008, it was announced that the U.S. government, in its trial against Trevor Graham, would have Mitchell, as well as Antonio Pettigrew as witnesses, with Mitchell to testify that Graham injected him with human growth hormone.

The Nor'west arch is a weather pattern peculiar to the east coast of New Zealand's South Island. For this reason, it is also often referred to as the Canterbury arch, although it is visible in both Otago and Marlborough as well as in the Canterbury Region. It is shown in an apparent arch of high white cloud in an otherwise clear blue sky over the Southern Alps, and is accompanied by a strong hot northwesterly or northerly wind simply known as The Nor'wester. Closer to the Canterbury coast, some distance from the mountains of the Southern Alps, it appears as a clear area of blue above the mountains, with white cloud streaming to the east from it. The phenomenon is similar to the Chinook arch seen in the Pacific regions of the United States and Canada. How Nor'west arches occur The Nor'wester is a f√∂hn wind - moist air is driven over the Southern Alps, falling as condensation on the western side, leaving the eastern plains in the rain shadow. Typical shot of a Canterbury, New Zealand nor'west arch during sunset The Nor'west arch is a f√∂hn cloud. The northwesterly wind drives warm moist air from over the Tasman Sea, and it is pushed up by the presence of the Southern Alps, causing it to cool rapidly. The area to the east of the divide is in the rain shadow of the Alps; much of the moisture is dumped on the West Coast, and is responsible for the temperate rainforests found there. As the air passes over the alps, the water vapour remaining becomes visible in a band of cloud over the mountains at the top of each wave of air. From the perspective of a viewer on the eastern side, this appears as an 'arch' of cloud. The standing wave or arch is caused by the moisture condensing and becoming visible towards the top of the wave and then evaporating again as the air descends to the trough of the wave. The Nor'west arch can be seen as far north as Amberley and as far south as Central Otago, but it is at its most prominent on the Canterbury Plains, due to the flat and low-lying nature of the land to the east of the mountains. The Nor'wester can blow at any time of year, but is less common in winter. Many of the strongest northerly and northwesterly winds blow ahead of cold fronts. A front lying across the South Island will often extend from northwest to southeast, reaching northern parts of the West Coast before it reaches corresponding areas on the east coast. The steep air pressure gradient ahead of the cyclonic system associated with a front gives these nor'westers their strength; they will commonly reach gale force and cause isolated damage to trees and buildings. Once every few years, a nor'wester will approach hurricane strength and cause widespread damage. Nor'westers caused by cold fronts will often change within a day or two to a cool southerly wind accompanied by rain showers, as the front passes through. In mid-winter, a Nor'wester is often followed by a brief but intense cold snap, frequently bringing thunder, hail, or snow which may settle to sea level. The heat and lack of moisture characteristic of nor'westers play a major role in the intermittent droughts experienced by Canterbury and other regions on New Zealand's eastern coasts. The Nor'wester has a deep psychological effect on many people subjected to its hot, dry nature. It has been statistically linked to increases in suicide and domestic violence.Erick Brenstrum, Canterbury's damaging nor'wester, New Zealand Geographic.

Micronutrient requirements differ between organisms; for example, humans and other animals require numerous vitamins and dietary minerals, whereas plants require specific minerals. For human nutrition, micronutrient requirements are in amounts generally less than 100 milligrams per day, whereas macronutrients are required in gram quantities daily. The minerals for humans and other animals include 13 elements that originate from Earth's soil and are not synthesized by living organisms, such as calcium and iron. Micronutrient requirements for animals also include vitamins, which are organic compounds required in microgram or milligram amounts. Since plants are the primary origin of nutrients for humans and animals, some micronutrients may be in low levels and deficiencies can occur when dietary intake is insufficient, as occurs in malnutrition, implying the need for initiatives to deter inadequate micronutrient supply in plant foods. A multiple micronutrient powder of at least iron, zinc, and vitamin A was added to the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines in 2019. Humans At the 1990 World Summit for Children, the gathered nations identified deficiencies in two microminerals and one micronutrient ‚Äì iodine, iron, and vitamin A ‚Äì as being particularly common and posing public health risks in developing countries.UNICEF, The State of the World‚Äôs Children 1998: Fact Sheet. http://www.unicef.org/sowc98/fs03.htm The Summit set goals for elimination of these deficiencies. The Ottawa-based Micronutrient Initiative was formed in response to this challenge with the mission to undertake research and fund and implement micronutrient programming.UNICEF Canada, Global Child Survival and Health: A 50-year progress report from UNICEF Canada, p. 68. As programming around these micronutrients grew, new research in the 1990s led to the implementation of folate and zinc supplementation programmes as well. Priority programs include supplementation with vitamin A for children 6‚Äì59 months, zinc supplementation as a treatment for diarrhoeal disease, iron and folate supplementation for women of child-bearing age, salt iodization, staple food fortification, multiple micronutrient powders, biofortification of crops and behaviour-centred nutrition education. There is low-quality evidence that food fortifications with micronutrients may reduce the risk of getting anemia and micronutrient deficiency but there is an uncertain effect on the height and weight of children. Meanwhile, there is no data to show adverse effects of micronutrients fortification. Fortification of maize flour with iron and other vitamins and minerals has uncertain benefits on reducing the risk of anemia. =Salt iodization= Salt iodization is the recommended strategy for ensuring adequate human iodine intake. To iodize salt, potassium iodate is added to salt after it is refined and dried and before it is packed. Although large- scale iodization is most efficient, given the proliferation of small scale salt producers in developing countries, technology for small-scale iodization has also been developed. International organizations work with national governments to identify and support small salt producers in adopting iodization activity. In 1990, less than 20 percent of households in developing countries were consuming iodized salt.Flour Fortification Initiative, GAIN, Micronutrient Initiative, USAID, The World Bank, UNICEF, Investing in the future: a united call to action on vitamin and mineral deficiencies, p. 19. By 1994, international partnerships had formed in a global campaign for Universal Salt Iodization. By 2008, it was estimated that 72 per cent of households in developing countries were consuming iodized saltUNICEF, The State of the World‚Äôs Children 2010, Statistical Tables, p. 15. and the number of countries in which iodine deficiency disorders were a public health concern reduced by more than half from 110 to 47 countries. =Vitamin A supplementation= In 1997, national vitamin A supplementation programming received a boost when experts met to discuss rapid scale-up of supplementation activity and the Micronutrient Initiative, with support from the Government of Canada, began to ensure vitamin A supply to UNICEF.UNICEF, Vitamin A Supplementation: a decade of progress, p. 1. In areas with vitamin A deficiency, it is recommended that children aged 6‚Äì59 months receive two doses annually. In many countries, vitamin A supplementation is combined with immunization and campaign-style health events. Global vitamin A supplementation efforts have targeted 103 priority countries. In 1999, 16 per cent of children in these countries received two annual doses of vitamin A. By 2007, the rate increased to 62 per cent.Flour Fortification Initiative, GAIN, Micronutrient Initiative, USAID, The World Bank, UNICEF, Investing in the future: a united call to action on vitamin and mineral deficiencies, p. 17. The Micronutrient Initiative, with funding from the Government of Canada, supplies 75 per cent of the vitamin A required for supplementation in developing countries.Micronutrient Initiative, Annual Report 2009-2010, p. 4. Fortification of staple foods with Vitamin A has uncertain benefits on reducing the risk of subclinical Vitamin A deficiency. =Double-fortified salt= Double-fortified salt (DFS) is a public health tool for delivering nutritional iron. DFS is fortified with both iodine and iron. It was developed by Venkatesh Mannar, Executive Director of the Micronutrient Initiative and University of Toronto Professor Levente Diosady, who discovered a process for coating iron particles with a vegetable fat to prevent the negative interaction of iodine and iron.L.L. Diosady and M.G. Venkatesh Mannar, Double Fortification Of Salt With Iron And Iodine, 2000 In India, Tata Salt Plus, priced at an economical rate of Rs 20 per kg, is an iodine plus iron fortified salt, developed by the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad through double fortification technology. This technology was offered to Tata Chemicals under a long-term MoU after due studies on bio- availability across the population strata conducted and published by NIN. It was first used in public programming in 2004. In September 2010 DFS was produced in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu and distributed through a state school feeding program. DFS has also been used to combat Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA) in the Indian state of Bihar.Evaluating the Impact on Anemia of Making Double Fortified Salt Available in Bihar, India  The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab In September 2010, Venkatesh Mannar was named a Laureat of the California-based Tech Awards for his work in developing Double- Fortified Salt. =Micro-enriched fertilization= The returns of applying micronutrient-enriched fertilizers could be huge for human health, social and economic development. Research has shown that enriching fertilizers with micronutrients had not only an impact on plant deficiencies but also on humans and animals, through the food chain. A 1994 report by the World Bank estimated that micronutrient malnutrition costs developing economies at least 5 percent of gross domestic product.World Bank (1994). Enriching Lives: Overcoming Vitamin and Mineral Malnutrition in Developing Countries. Development in Practice Series. The Asian Development Bank has summarized the benefits of eliminating micronutrient deficiencies as follows: > Along with a growing understanding of the extent and impact of micronutrient > malnutrition, several interventions have demonstrated the feasibility and > benefits of correction and prevention. Distributing inexpensive capsules, > diversifying to include more micronutrient-rich foods, or fortifying > commonly consumed foods can make an enormous difference. Correcting iodine, > vitamin A, and iron deficiencies can improve the population-wide > intelligence quotient by 10-15 points, reduce maternal deaths by one fourth, > decrease infant and child mortality by 40 percent, and increase people‚Äôs > work capacity by almost half. The elimination of these deficiencies will > reduce health care and education costs, improve work capacity and > productivity, and accelerate equitable economic growth and national > development. Improved nutrition is essential to sustained economic growth. > Micronutrient deficiency elimination is as cost effective as the best public > health interventions and fortification is the most cost-effective > strategy.Asia Development Bank (October 2000). > [www.adb.org/Documents/TARs/REG/tar_oth34014.pdf Regional Initiative to > Eliminate Micronutrient Malnutrition in Asia Through Public-Private > Partnership]. TAR: OTH 34014. Retrieved on: 2011-10-13. =Zinc= Fortification of staple foods with zinc exclusively may improve serum zinc levels in the population. Other effects such as improving zinc deficiency, children's growth, cognition, work capacity of adults, or blood indicators are unknown. Experiments show that soil and foliar application of zinc fertilizer can effectively reduce the phytate zinc ratio in grain. People who eat bread prepared from zinc enriched wheat show a significant increase in serum zinc, suggesting that the zinc fertilizer strategy is a promising approach to address zinc deficiencies in humans. Where zinc deficiency is a limiting factor, zinc fertilization can increase crop yields. Balanced crop nutrition supplying all essential nutrients, including zinc, is a cost- effective management strategy. Even with zinc-efficient varieties, zinc fertilizers are needed when the available zinc in the topsoil becomes depleted. Plants There are about seven nutrients essential to plant growth and health that are only needed in very small quantities. Though these are present in only small quantities, they are all necessary: *Boron is believed to be involved in carbohydrate transport in plants; it also assists in metabolic regulation. Boron deficiency will often result in bud dieback. *Chlorine is necessary for osmosis and ionic balance; it also plays a role in photosynthesis. *Copper is a component of some enzymes. Symptoms of copper deficiency include browning of leaf tips and chlorosis. *Iron is essential for chlorophyll synthesis, which is why an iron deficiency results in chlorosis. *Manganese activates some important enzymes involved in chlorophyll formation. Manganese deficient plants will develop chlorosis between the veins of its leaves. The availability of manganese is partially dependent on soil pH. *Molybdenum is essential to plant health. Molybdenum is used by plants to reduce nitrates into usable forms. Some plants use it for nitrogen fixation, thus it may need to be added to some soils before seeding legumes. *Zinc participates in chlorophyll formation, and also activates many enzymes. Symptoms of zinc deficiency include chlorosis and stunted growth. =Crop biofortification= Micronutrient deficiencies are widespread. 51% of world cereal soils are deficient in zinc and 30% of cultivated soils globally are deficient in iron. Steady growth of crop yields during recent decades (in particular through the Green Revolution) compounded the problem by progressively depleting soil micronutrient pools. In general, farmers only apply micronutrients when crops show deficiency symptoms, while micronutrient deficiencies decrease yields before symptoms appear. Some common farming practices (such as liming acid soils) contribute to widespread occurrence of micronutrient deficiencies in crops by decreasing the availability of the micronutrients present in the soil. Biofortification of crop plants - improvement of vitamin and mineral levels through plant biotechnology - is being used in many world regions to address micronutrient deficiencies in regions of poverty and malnutrition.

Defence was sunk on 31 May 1916 during the Battle of Jutland, the largest naval battle of the war. Escorting the main body of the Grand Fleet, the ship was fired upon by one German battlecruiser and four dreadnoughts as she attempted to engage a disabled German light cruiser. She was struck by two salvoes from the German ships that detonated her rear magazine. The fire from that explosion spread to the ship's secondary magazines, which exploded in turn.

Three months later Defence was reassigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron.Burt, pp. 89, 91 She escorted the ocean liner in 1911‚Äì1912 while the latter ship served as the royal yacht for the newly crowned King George V's trip to India to attend the Delhi Durbar.Gardiner and Gray, p. 13 After the ship returned to Plymouth in early 1912, Defence was transferred to the China Station, where she remained until December when she was ordered to rejoin the 1st Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean as flagship.Burt, p. 91 BL 9.2-inch Mk XI guns At the start of the First World War, she was involved in the pursuit of the German warships Goeben and Breslau, but Rear-Admiral Ernest Troubridge decided not to engage Goeben due to the latter's more powerful guns, heavier armour and faster speed.Corbett, p. 65 She then blockaded the German ships inside the Dardanelles until the ship was ordered on 10 September to the South Atlantic to take part in the hunt for Admiral Graf von Spee's East Asia Squadron. The order was cancelled on 14 September when it became clear that the German squadron was still in the Eastern Pacific and Defence returned to the Dardanelles.Corbett, pp. 291, 314 The Admiralty again ordered the ship to the South Atlantic in October to join Rear-Admiral Christopher Cradock's squadron searching for the German ships. Defence, however, had only reached Montevideo, Uruguay by 3 November 1914 when she received word that most of Admiral Cradock's squadron had been destroyed two days previously at the Battle of Coronel. The ship rendezvoused with the battlecruisers and later that month and transferred her long-range radio equipment to Invincible before sailing to South Africa to escort a troop convoy to Great Britain. Defence departed Table Bay, Cape Town on 8 December and rejoined the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet as its flagship upon her arrival.Burt, p. 91 Defence received a QF 12-pounder (3-inch) 12 cwt anti-aircraft (AA) gun and a QF 3-pounder (47 mm) AA gun in 1915‚Äì16. The 12-pounder gun was mounted on the aft superstructure and the 3-pounder on the quarterdeck at the extreme rear.Burt, p. 87 During the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916, she was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Arbuthnot, leading the First Cruiser Squadron. The squadron formed the starboard flank of the cruiser screen, ahead of the main body of the Grand Fleet. Defence was just to the right of the centre of the line. At 5:47 p.m.,The times used in this article are in UTC, which is one hour behind CET, which is often used in German works. Defence, and , the leading two ships of the squadron, spotted the German II Scouting Group and opened fire. Their shells fell short and the two ships turned to port in pursuit, cutting in front of the battlecruiser , which was forced to turn away to avoid a collision. Shortly afterwards, they spotted the disabled German light cruiser and closed to engage. When the two ships reached a range of from Wiesbaden they were spotted in turn at 6:05 by the German battlecruiser and four battleships who were less than away.Marder, pp. 112‚Äì113 The fire from the German ships was heavy and Defence was hit by two salvoes from the German ships that caused the aft 9.2-inch magazine to explode. The resulting fire spread via the ammunition passages to the adjacent 7.5-inch magazines which detonated in turn.Brown, p. 167 The ship exploded at 6:20 with the loss of all men on board; between 893 and 903 men were killed.Burt, p. 92 Defence today At the time, it was believed that Defence had been reduced to fragments by the explosion, but the wreck was discovered in mid-1984 by Clive Cussler and a NUMA survey of the North Sea and English Channel at coordinates .

History The Vulcan Foundry opened in 1832, as the Charles Tayleur and Company to produce girders for bridges, switches, crossings and other ironwork following the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Due to the distance from the locomotive works in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, it seemed preferable to build and support them locally. In 1832, Robert Stephenson became a partner for a few years. The company had become The Vulcan Foundry Company in 1847 and acquired limited liability in 1864. From the beginning of 1898, the name changed again to The Vulcan Foundry Limited, dropping the word 'company.' =Vulcan Halt= The site had its own railway station, Vulcan Halt, on the former Warrington and Newton Railway line from to . The wooden-platformed halt was opened on 1 November 1916Quicks Chronology. by the London and North Western Railway, and closed on 12 June 1965. Steam locomotives KF7, built by Vulcan, in the National Railway Museum in York Vulcan Foundry works plate No. 3977 of 1926 on LMS Fowler Class 3F No. 47406 in 2012 Details of the earliest locomotives are not precisely known despite an \\"official\\" list apparently concocted in the 1890s which contains a lot of guesswork and invention, with many quite fictitious locomotives, for the period before 1845. This list claims that the first two locomotives were 0-4-0 Tayleur and Stephenson built in 1833 for \\"Mr Hargreaves, Bolton\\", but this seems unlikely. The earliest authenticated products were 0-4-0 Titan and Orion, similar to Stephenson's design, and delivered in September and October 1834 to the Liverpool & Manchester Railway. Other early orders came from the Leicester and Swannington Railway and there were also some 4-2-0s for America which were among the first British 'bogie' locomotives. From 1835 the company was selling to Belgium, France, and in 1836 to Austria and Russia, the beginnings of an export trade which was maintained throughout the life of the company. The company's locomotives had a strong Stephenson influence, many during the following decade being of the \\"long boiler\\" design. In 1852 the first locomotives ever to run in India were supplied to the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. A number of Fairlie locomotives were built, including Taliesin for the Ffestiniog Railway and Josephine one of the NZR E class (1872). During 1870 the company supplied the first locomotives to run in Japan, and a flangeless 0-4-0T for a steelworks in Tredegar which was still using angle rails. A number of Matthew Kirtley's double-framed goods engines were also produced for the Midland Railway. The healthy export trade continued, particularly to India and South America, and continued after World War I. Following the formation of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923 some very large orders were received, including over a hundred LMS Fowler Class 3F 0-6-0T engines and seventy-five LMS Compound 4-4-0 locomotives. The most notable design manufactured for an overseas railway during this period was the large 4-8-4 built for the Chinese National Railways in 1934‚Äì35. These fine locomotives were equipped with a mechanical stoker and six of them were fitted with booster engines on the tender, providing an extra tractive effort. Of the 24 exported, one returned to the UK and is preserved at the National Railway Museum in York. Through the 1930s the company survived the trade recessions with the aid of more orders from India, some from Tanganyika and Argentina, and a large order in 1934 from the LMS for 4-6-0 \\"Black Fives\\" and 2-8-0 Stanier-designed locomotives. During 1953-54 the company built sixty J class 2-8-0 locomotives for the Victorian Railways in Australia. Second World War From 1939 the works was mostly concerned with the war effort, becoming involved in the development and production of the Matilda II tank. From 1943 large orders were received from the Ministry of Supply for locomotives, 390 Austerity 2-8-0s and fifty Austerity 0-6-0 saddle tanks. In 1944 the Vulcan Foundry acquired Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns and in 1945 received an order for 120 \\"Liberation\\" 2-8-0 locomotives for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in Europe. The war had left India's railways in a parlous state and in 1947, with foreign aid, embarked on a massive rebuilding plan. The Vulcan Foundry benefited from orders for XE, XD, and YD 2-8-2s; and ten WG 2-8-2s sub-contracted from the North British Locomotive Company, but the writing was on the wall for all British manufacturers. Not only was the competition fierce from other countries, but India had developed the ability to build its own locomotives. Diesel and electric locomotives railcar on Plains Vintage Railway, Ashburton, New Zealand. BR Class 40 no D213 Andania was one of a hundred and eighty members of the class to be built at the Vulcan Foundry in Newton-le-Willows. The company had experience of both diesel and electric locomotives, having built thirty-one so-called \\"Crocodile\\" 2600 hp 1,500 V DC electric freight locomotives in 1929 for India. These were classified as EF/1 which after Indian independence became the WCG-1 class. India's National Rail Museum, New Delhi exhibits an WCG-1 locomotive from the Vulcan foundry. They also helped in supply of the WCM-1 and WCM-2 class. In 1931, the company supplied the first experimental diesel shunter to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. In 1936, Vulcan, a diesel-mechanical 0-6-0 shunter with a Vulcan-Frichs 6-cylinder 275 hp (205 kW) diesel engine was loaned to the LMS, and was then used by the War Department, which numbered it 75 (later 70075). Following the end of World War II, it found industrial use in Yugoslavia. In 1938, ten diesel railcars were ordered by New Zealand Railways, the NZR RM class (Vulcan). They were supplied in 1940, although one was lost at sea to enemy action. In 1948, it supplied 10 Class 15 Diesel Electric shunters to Malayan Railways, as well as twenty Class 20 Diesel Electric locomotives for the same company nine years later. The works has produced many locomotives for both domestic and foreign railways. It was a major supplier of diesel-electrics to British Railways notably the Class 55 Deltic. The works also developed a prototype gas turbine locomotive, the British Rail GT3. Other classes of diesel locomotives to be built for British Railways at the Vulcan Foundry included: Class 20, Class 37, Class 40 and Class 50. Electric locomotives were also built for British Rail by Vulcan Foundry, which included many Class 86s in 1965 and 1966. In the mid-1950s, negotiations began to sell the company. In 1957, the purchase was finalised and the business became part of the English Electric group. Although the works still produced diesel engines under name Ruston Paxman Diesels Limited, which had been moved from Lincoln, locomotive manufacturing finished in 1970. Output was mainly for marine and stationary applications, but the company was the supplier of choice for British Rail Engineering Limited for locomotives built at Doncaster and Crewe. Vulcan Roman god of fire, metalworking and the forge Sale and closure The factory passed through various hands as English Electric was bought by GEC, which in turn became GEC Alsthom (later renamed Alstom) and finally as part of MAN Diesel in 2000. At the end of 2002, the works closed. It was then an industrial estate, appropriately called \\"Vulcan Industrial Estate\\". The site is just north of Winwick Junction, where the line to Newton-le-Willows branches off to the west from the West Coast Main Line. All the (ex) factory buildings on the site were demolished in October 2007 and now there is not one brick standing upon another to show that Vulcan Foundry was ever there, but the workers cottages, known as \\"Vulcan Village\\", still survive at the southern corner of the site. By early 2010, work had started on the construction of 630 homes on the levelled site by the developer St Modwen.

England and Wales The Infanticide Act 1922 effectively abolished the death penalty for a woman who deliberately killed her newborn child, while the balance of her mind was disturbed as a result of giving birth, by providing a partial defence to murder. The sentence that applies (as in other partial defences to murder) is the same as that for manslaughter. This act was repealed by section 2(3) of the Infanticide Act 1938. The Infanticide Act 1938 extended this defence to cases where \\"at the time of the act or omission the balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or by reason of the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child.\\"Infanticide Act, 1938, Second Reading, House of Lords Hansard. 22 March 1938 Before the partial murder defence of diminished responsibility became part of English law in the Homicide Act 1957, this provided other than referral for possible insanity, the main means of lenient sentencing for a mother found guilty of deliberate killing of her infant than the mandatory life sentence or death sentence applying to murder. In the 21st century it has become common for a severely post-natally depressed mother who kills her infant child not to receive a prison sentence, except in exceptional circumstances. Where a less extreme or no condition is suffered by the mother then causing or allowing a child (under 15) to die (under the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, s.5) carries as of 2019 an effective sentence recommentation, unless the seven influential steps of sentencing determine otherwise, of 1‚Äì14 years' custody. https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/offences/crown-court/item/causing-or- allowing-a-child-to-suffer-serious-physical-harm-causing-or-allowing-a-child- to-die/ Offender's responsibility substantially reduced by mental disorder or learning disability or lack of maturity will mean the lowest of three culpabilities applies, \\"Lesser culpability\\", and in that instance the starting point is taken as two years' custody setting a possible range of 1 to 4 years' custody. In a report the terms of which were agreed on 1 November 2006, the Law Commission recognised the difficulties facing the court when a defendant is in denial and unwilling to submit to psychiatric examination, as she perceives the purpose of such examination as an attempt to prove her guilt. In such cases, the mother is unlikely to have any other defence and is therefore more likely to be convicted of murder or causing a child to die.The Law Commission.

Work  Sometimes classified as a Minimalist, Buren is known best for using regular, contrasting colored stripes in an effort to integrate visual surface and architectural space, notably on historical, landmark architecture. Among his primary concerns is the \\"scene of production\\" as a way of presenting art and highlighting facture (the process of 'making' rather than for example, mimesis or representation of anything but the work itself). The work is site-specific installation, having a relation to its setting in contrast to prevailing ideas of an autonomous work of art. = Early work = He graduated from the Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure des M√©tiers d'Art in Paris, in 1960.Daniel Buren Tate Collection. He began painting in the early 1960s. However, by 1965 ‚Äì a year he spent in the Grapetree Bay Hotel on the Caribbean island of Saint CroixDaniel Buren: Peinture √©mail sur toile de coton, 1965 Phillips de Pury & Company. where he was contracted to make frescoes ‚Äì he had abandoned traditional painting for the 8.7 cm-wide vertical stripes, which alternated between white and one color, which have become his signature. Working on-site, he strives to contextualise his artistic practice using the stripe ‚Äì a popular French fabric motif ‚Äì as a means of visually relating art to its situation, a form of language in space rather than a space in itself. Denoting the trademark stripes as a visual instrument or \\"seeing tool,\\" he invites viewers to take up his critical standpoint challenging traditional ideas about art. He began producing unsolicited public art works using striped awning canvas common in France: he started by setting up hundreds of striped posters, so-called affichages sauvages, around Paris and later in more than 100 Metro stations, drawing public attention through these unauthorised bandit-style acts. In June 1970 he put stripes on the front and back of Los Angeles bus benches without permission. In another controversial gesture he blocked the entrance of the gallery with stripes of his first solo exhibition. Expanding on this idea, in 1971 he created a six-foot banner, Peinture-Sculpture, to divide the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum's rotunda in New York. For his first New York City solo show in 1973, Buren suspended a set of nineteen black and white striped squares of canvas on a cable that ran from one end of the John Weber Gallery to the other, out the window to a building on the other side of West Broadway and back.Linda Yablonsky (20 March 2005), The Guggenheim Outcast Who Laughed Last The New York Times. Nine pieces were inside the gallery and nine outside; a middle piece, which connected the outside and the inside parts of the installation, was placed half-in and half-out in the opening where the window frame had been removed for the duration of the exhibition.Within and Beyond the Frame, 1973 , Monumenta 2012, Paris. Retrieved 2015-02-12. In 1977 Buren cut up one of his artworks from 1969 and made a new work, designating that the sections should hang in the corners of a wall, whether that wall was empty, had doors or windows, or even had other artworks already hanging on it.Daniel Buren: One Painting in Four Elements for One Wall, 1969‚Äì77 MoMA. Tours Tram ‚Äì The vertical stripes ; Collaboration design with RCP Design Global As a conceptual artist, Buren was regarded as visually and spatially audacious, objecting to traditional ways of presenting art through the museum-gallery system while at the same time growing in hot demand to show via the same system. In the late 1960s he connected to the ideas of space and presentation arising through deconstructionist philosophies that had as their background the May 1968 student demonstrations in France. Between 1966 and 1967, he joined forces with fellow artists Olivier Mosset, Michel Parmentier, and Niele Toroni to form the BMPT, whose intention was to reduce paintings to the most basic physical and visual elements through the systematic repetition of motifs. Often referred to as \\"the stripe guy,\\" Buren also expresses his theme in paint, laser cut fabric, light boxes, transparent fabrics and ceramic cup sets. His stripes are displayed in private homes, public places, and museums worldwide. Since the 1950s he has amassed some 400,000 of what he calls photos-souvenirs, documenting his work and travels around the globe. = Installations = From 1960 on, Buren designed a number of permanent site- specific installations in the United States, Belgium, France, and Germany. In 1986 he created a 3,000-square-meter sculpture in the great courtyard of the Palais Royal, in Paris: Les Deux Plateaux, more commonly referred to as the Colonnes de Buren (\\"Buren's Columns\\"). This provoked an intense debate over the integration of contemporary art and historic buildings. In 1993, Buren was commissioned to design the work in situ, Poser/D√©poser/Exposer, for the Caf√© Richelieu at the Louvre in collaboration with Jean-Pierre Raynaud. Since the 1990s, Buren's work has become more architectural. He creates new spaces within existing environments such as city centers (A Colored Square in the Sky, 2007), public parks (La Cabane √âclat√©e aux 4 Salles, 2005), entire museums (The Eye of the Storm, 2005), and even beaches (', 2009).Daniel Buren Crown Point Press, San Francisco. For Green and White Fence (1999/2001) Buren installed a functional fence sculpture, consisting of fence posts at four- meter intervals, painted green and white 87-millimeter stripes along a single ridge line: Since the first part's installation, the artist‚Äôs theme has been extended until, over time, it will become the only form of fence on Gibbs Farm in New Zealand.Daniel Buren Gibbs Farm. In 2004, for the occasion of the opening of the French cultural year in China, Buren exhibited in his in situ installation De l'azur au Temple du Ciel (From the sky to Temple of Heaven) at Temple of Heaven in Beijing.Daniel Buren Xin Dong Cheng Space for Contemporary Art, Beijing.

Buren collaborated with Herm√®s on a number of occasions. The artist inaugurated Herm√®s' contemporary art gallery La Verri√®re in Brussels in 2000 by transforming its walls with bold graphics, colours and his trademark stripes, and later opened the Atelier Herm√®s in Dosan Park, Seoul with his Filtres color√©s, coloured panels that diffused the light to dramatic effect.Malaika Byng, Herm√®s scarves by Daniel Buren Wallpaper Magazine.

In 2014, the rooftop of Modernist architect Le Corbusier's Cit√© Radieuse building in Marseilles hosted an installation of mirrors and coloured glass by Buren. D√©fini, Fini, Infini (2014) was an installation for the Marseilles Modulor (MaMo), led by French designer Ora- √èto, who in 2013 transformed the iconic rooftop into an international arts space.de zeen magazine (16 July 2014), . In 2017, Buren completed his first permanent installation in the United Kingdom, 'Diamonds and Circles' permanent works 'in situ', a work for Art on the Underground on the walls of the expanded ticket hall at Tottenham Court Road. = Performance = From 1966 to '67, Buren and the other BMPT artists staged a series of performances they called manifestations, in which the group made or exhibited their work in public as a critical encounter with audiences. Voile/Toile ‚Äì Toile/Voile, a piece consisting of boat races followed by museum displays of sail-canvasses, was originally created for a regatta on the Wannsee, Berlin, in 1975 and later produced in Geneva (1979), Lucerne (1980), Villeneuve-d'Ascq (1983), Lyon- Villeurbanne (1998), Tel Aviv (1999), Sevilla (2004), and Grasmere (2005). This work always has two separate parts. In the first, nine Optimists are fitted with striped canvas sails (white with red, blue, yellow, green or brown stripes). The two white stripes at the edges are covered with white paint. The boats then race in a regatta. In the second part, after the race, the sails are exhibited in a museum in the city where the regatta was held. They are presented in the order they crossed the finishing line, from one to nine and from left to right, as befits the exhibition area.Voile/Toile ‚Äì Toile/Voile, 1975 Monumenta Paris. In 1973 and 1974 Daniel Buren, performs with Jannis Kounellis, Wolf Vostell and other artists in Berlin at the ADA ‚Äì Aktionen der Avantgarde.ADA 1 y 2 Initially presented in Genazzano in 1982, as part of a group project called La zattera di Babele (\\"The Raft of Babel\\"), Couleurs superpos√©es (Layered colours) is an hour-long public performance, during which paper is pasted up and then torn down. For forty minutes, five actors paste striped colored paper on the wall, according to the artist's instructions. The white stripes must be exactly aligned. The spectators see colours and shapes appearing and disappearing as successive layers are added. Then for the remaining twenty minutes, the actors, still directed by the artist, tear off the freshly pasted papers to reveal fragments of the previous layers. The spectators watch the evolution of work on a picture that is never finished and whose successive stages are recorded only in their memory. After the performance, the piece is destroyed.Couleurs superpos√©es, 1982 Monumenta Paris. The piece was later performed in Tokyo, Bern, Eindhoven, Venice, Villeneuve d'Ascq, New York (2005), and Paris (2005).2007: Daniel Buren Praemium Imperiale.

He has since presented his environmental installations worldwide. By the 1970s and 1980s he was exhibiting in Europe, America and Japan. Buren wished to take part in Harald Szeemann's exhibition \\"When Attitudes Become Form\\", in Bern in 1969, without being invited. Two of the contributing artists offered him space, but he instead set about covering billboards in the city with his stripes. He was arrested and had to leave Switzerland.Adrian Searle (15 November 2006), Through the square windowsThe Guardian. In 1971, Buren devised a banner, 20 by 10 metres, with white and blue stripes on both sides to be hung at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in a big international group show, conceived to encourage artists to exploit the building's space. Other artists, including Dan Flavin and Donald Judd, protested that the banner blocked views across the rotunda, compromising their works. Buren, in turn, said Flavin's fluorescent lights colored his banner. The night before the opening, the banner was removed.Michael Kimmelman (25 March 2005), Tall French Visitor Takes Up Residence in the GuggenheimThe New York Times. Buren was later invited to participate in the Documentas 5 through 7 (1972‚Äì1982). In 1986, when Fran√ßois Mitterrand was president of France, Buren attained leading artist status after he created Les Deux Plateaux (1985‚Äì86), a work in situ for the Cour d'honneur at the Palais Royal in Paris. That same year, he represented France at the Venice Biennale and won the Golden Lion Award for best pavilion. Buren had major solo exhibitions at the Touko Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo, in 1989, at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris in 2002,The Eye of the Storm: Works in situ by Daniel Buren, 25 March ‚Äì 8 June 2005 Guggenheim Museum. at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2005, at Modern Art Oxford in 2006, and at the Kunsthalle Baden-Baden in 2011. In December 2006 Buren won the competition to make Arcos Rojos/Arku Gorriaka, a new major project for the iconic Puente de La Salve bridge next to the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao while, in February 2007, the Mus√©e Fabre in Montpellier re-opened with a new permanent commission. For the 52nd Venice Biennale, Buren created a new site-specific work for the Giardini of the Italian Pavilion, and was curator of Sophie Calle's contribution to the French Pavilion.Daniel Buren, 18 May ‚Äì 23 June 2007 Lisson Gallery, London. In 2011, he decided to cancel an exhibition at the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing in \\"solidarity\\" with detained artist Ai Weiwei.French artist cancels China show over Ai detention AFP. The fifth artist ever to fill the space of the Grand Palais on the occasion of the Monumenta exhibition, Buren conceived Excentrique(s) in 2012, a giant cluster of colored, transparent plastic discs, which overlap to form a colourful canopy.Emma O'Kelly (11 May 2012), 'Excentrique(s)' by Daniel Buren for Monumenta at the Grand Palais, Paris Wallpaper Magazine. =List of selected exhibitions= 1960‚Äì61 * First public commission of murals for a hotel on St. Croix (U.S. Virgin Islands).

History She was commissioned by Lt M.T. Hewitt for Captain George Keppel. He sailed her with the Channel Fleet during September and October 1796 at which time it was reported that, > Her qualifications are described as having been of a very superior order. > She stowed her provisions well, and when sailing with the Channel fleet in > September and October, 1796, beat all the line of battle ships, and kept > pace with the frigates. \\" Upon a wind,\\" Rays the Master's report, \\" spared > them\\" (the line of battle ships) \\" main-sail and top-gallant sails, and > sailing two or three points free or before the wind, beat them still more.\\" > At this time the Defiance's draught of water forward was 20 feet 5 inches; > aft, 22 feet 5 inches; height of the midship port, 5 feet 8 inches. Her > masts were stayed thus: \\"foremast nearly upright, main and mizenmasts rake > aft.\\"The United service magazine, London, 1844, p.98 Her crew mutinied three times, firstly in October 1795, when she was under the command of Captain Sir George Home. He initially had to release the ringleaders when the ratings attempted to storm the officer's quarters, but later these and additional mutineers were put in irons when, > ...in the afternoon a strong party of the 7th, or South Fencible regiment, > and several officers, arrived on board. On the 20th, at 10 a.m., a general > muster of the ship's company was made, and the eight men, previously in > irons, together with three more, were placed in confinement, and others were > subsequently added. A few days afterwards the South Fencibles were relieved > by a detachment of the 134th Regt., in number 132, under Lieut.-Colonel > Baillie, and with these the Defiance sailed from Leith and returned to the > Nore.The United service magazine, London, 1844, p.99 The stationing of the Army troops was required because the ship sailed without its contingent of 60 Marines, which later embarked at Sheerness. On 23 March 1796 Captain Theophilus Jones took command. The crew of the Defiance mutinied for a second time in 1797 during the Spithead mutiny. Captain William Bligh of the was ordered to embark 200 troops and take them alongside in order for the troops to board Defiance and regain control, however the threat of the soldiers was sufficient to bring about an end to the mutiny. Her ship's company mutinied again in 1798 during the rising of the United Irishmen.TNA ADM 1/5346 - Court martial papers Eleven men were hanged and ten transported for life in the penal colony of New South Wales. Her next Captain was Thomas Revell Shivers, who took command on 27 February 1797 at Torbay. In the summer of 1800, Defiance was attached to the squadron under Sir Alan Gardner, stationed off the Black Rocks. On 24 December 1800, Capt. Richard Retallick superseded Capt. Shivers, Defiance being selected for the flagship of Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Graves. She fought at the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801, as the flagship of Rear Admiral Thomas Graves, with Captain Retallick commanding. The station in the line occupied in the battle was abreast of the Crown battery, which mounted thirty-six heavy guns, and was provided with a furnace for heating shot. Owing to the mishaps that kept , Russell, and Agamemnon from taking up their assigned stations, the Defiance became exposed to a severe cross fire, from which she suffered very severe damage.The United service magazine, London, 1844, p.101 > In furtherance of the designs of Lord Nelson, when Sir Hyde Parker made the > signal to discontinue the action, which Nelson would not see, Rear-Admiral > Graves in the Defiance repeated the signal at the lee maintopsail yardarm, > from whence it could not be seen on board the Elephant. The Defiance > continued firing until 3h. 15m. p.m., when the action ceased ; and her > spring being cut and sail made, she dropped out of the station she had > occupied.

She also participated in the Battle of Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805, and the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October, whilst under the command of Captain Philip Charles Durham, who claimed that \\"she was the fastest 74 gun ship in the British fleet\\". At Trafalgar the Defiance captured the Spanish San Juan Nepomuceno, and the French Aigle (although the following day the French crew managed to recapture the Aigle from the British prize crew shortly before she was wrecked during the storm of 23 October). Prior to the boarding of the Aigle by a full boarding party from the Defiance, James \\"Jack\\" Spratt dived into the sea from Defiance, swimming with a cutlass between his teeth to the Aigle he climbed in through a stern window and boarded her single handed. He found his way to the French poop deck and threw himself on the French crew, one man against several hundred. In the melee he killed two French seamen, and was grappling with a third when he fell from the poop deck to the main deck, killing his opponent but injuring himself badly. He was saved by the timely arrival of a full boarding party from Defiance. During the battle of Trafalgar Defiance and sustained casualties of 57 killed, and 153 wounded. In 1809, she took part in the Battle of Les Sables-d'Olonne. After serving as a prison ship at Chatham from 1813, she was broken up in 1817.

The bands‚Äô names followed the naming of the political entities of the Soviet Union and its dissolution in the late 20th century. \\"CCCP\\" is the Cyrillic lettering for SSSR (i.e. USSR), and \\"CSI\\" mimics the Italian acronym for the Commonwealth of Independent States. =PGR= From 2002, he led the band PGR, an abbreviation of Per Grazia Ricevuta (\\"For a Received Grace\\"). This is a stock phrase usually attached to mementos acknowledging miraculous divine gifts. The new band name, in fact, marked his own rediscovery of his Catholic roots. PGR's lineup changed with the release of the album D‚Äôanime e d‚Äôanimali (2004), and in the fashion of previous incarnations the name was altered. In this case, however, the band's acronym was only slightly changed into PG3R (Per√≤ Gianni Giorgio Giovanni Resistono, meaning \\"Yet Gianni Giorgio and Giovanni Resist\\"). PGR toured again in 2006, with the tour entitled 'Ripasso / Ribassi ‚Äì Saldi, fino ad esaurimento scorte‚Äô (Revision / Discounts ‚Äì Sales while Stock Lasts). With the release of the album Ultime notizie di cronaca in 2009, the band announced its dissolution. =Solo work and collaborations with other artists= In 2000 Lindo Ferretti published the book In Mongolia in retromarcia (\\"In Mongolia, in reverse\\"), co-authored with Massimo Zamboni, about their journey there. This trip also influenced CSI's third album, Tabula Rasa Elettrificata. Also in 2000 he released a solo album, Co.Dex. In 2003, together with director Giorgio Barberio Corsetti, Lindo Ferretti wrote the texts and lyrics for the theatrical work Iniziali: BCGLF. The music was composed by fellow PGR member Gianni Maroccolo. A CD of the same name was released in 2004. Also in 2004 he released the album Litania (\\"Litany\\"), co-authored with Ambrogio Sparagna, which contains both folk prayers and pieces from the repertoire of CCCP and CSI. He toured Italy again in 2005 with the theatrical shows Falce e Martello. Falciati e martellati. Requiem per una civilt√† (\\"Hammer and Sickle. Hammered and Sickled. Requiem for a Civilisation\\"), with Ambrogio Sparagna, and Pascolare parole, allevare pensieri (\\"Pasturing words, Breeding thoughts\\"), with Lorenzo Esposito Fornasari, Raffaele Pinelli and Ezio Bonicelli. =Politics and recent activities= Radical left political thought marked much of Lindo Ferretti's musical and artistic output, and he had been involved with the extra- parliamentary radical group Lotta Continua. He subsequently revised his political thinking, however, and in the 2006 elections he voted for the right- center coalition. In 2006, he published his first autobiographical book, Reduce (\\"Returned/Survivor\\"), in which he describes his new poetics and views on life through childhood memories, poems and invectives against the contemporary world. He accompanied the release of the book with a new show of the same name, featuring the same artists he had previously worked with on Pascolare parole, allevare pensieri. Concerning his conversion to Roman Catholicism, he has said, \\"I was raised by my grandmother and parents as a Catholic. But I was also a child of the 1960s and I voluntarily adhered to communism, that pestilence of the soul that stole the best children from our families. In a certain sense I have returned home. But I cannot bear the idea of being an anti-communist with the same stupidity and spite as when I was an atheist and blasphemer. I want a bit more dignity than that.\\"Antonio Socci. \\"Intervista a Giovanni Lindo Ferretti\\" (in Italian), Libero, 3 September 2006. His association with the Catholic organisation Communion and Liberation, led to his participation in their 2007 festival in Rimini, where he spoke at a meeting about the Priestly Fraternity of the Missionaries of St.Charles Borromeo. Since Sunday 4 September 2011, he will be the author of a column on Avvenire, an important Italian catholic newspaper published by the Italian Episcopal Conference. Lindo Ferretti currently lives in his native village, where he is a horse breeder.

Life Born as Karl Heinrich Johann Eugen Benzler in Niederhemer, Westphalia, the eldest son of Karl Benzler, an innkeeper, and his wife, Klementine (n√©e Kissing), he was baptized at SS Peter and Paul Church on 24 October 1853. After attending the elementary school in Niederhemer and the h√∂here B√ºrgerschule in Menden, he went on to study at the secondary school in Attendorn, and (from 1867‚Äì1871) at the gymnasium Paulinium in M√ºnster, where he graduated. After beginning to study architecture in Cologne, in December 1871 he changed to study philosophy and Catholic theology at the University of Innsbruck. In the autumn of 1872 he joined the Collegium Canisianum maintained by the Jesuits; however, his application to join the order was denied in 1874. Instead he joined the Benedictine abbey of Beuron and chose the name Willibrord. On 28 August 1877 he was ordained to the priesthood by Johann Baudri, auxiliary bishop of Cologne. During the Kulturkampf the monks of Beuron were forced to leave the country. From 1875 to 1880 they stayed in Volders (Tyrol). In 1880 they were invited to revive the Emaus Abbey in Prague. From 1883 to 1887 he was prior of Seckau Abbey in Styria, which had been revived as a priory of Beuron. In 1887 the monks were able to return to their monastery in Beuron, where he became prior. In 1892 Maria Laach Abbey was refounded by the monks of Beuron, and Willibrord Benzler became its prior. On 15 October 1893 the priory was made an abbey, and he became the first abbot. On 8 December he was consecrated as abbot by Wilhelm von Reiser, Bishop of Rottenburg. Even though Benzler had earlier been discussed as a possible bishop of Cologne or Fulda, his appointment as bishop of Metz on 21 September 1901 was somewhat surprising. He was ordained on 28 October 1901 by Michael Felix Korum, bishop of Trier. After World War I the diocese of Metz became French again, and a German bishop was no longer acceptable; Benzler therefore resigned in January 1919. His resignation was officially accepted on 10 July; on 31 July he was appointed archbishop of the titular see of Attalia in Pamphylia. He returned to his abbey in Maria Laach and later to Beuron, but a serious heart disease forced him to move to the Cistercian abbey of Lichtenthal near Baden-Baden to receive medical help. In 1921 he died there, and was buried at his first abbey in Beuron.  Coat of arms  Coat of arms of Bishop Benzler The bishopric coat of arms of Willibrord Benzler showed on the heraldic right side three silver fish on blue ground, while to the left it had a red cross of Lorraine with the word \\"PAX\\" (peace). The origin of the three hills to the bottom of the cross is unknown, they might have been a reference to his hometown in the hills of the Sauerland.

With the adjacent village of Handsacre, it forms the parish of Armitage with Handsacre. The area of Armitage with Handsacre had a population of 5,335 at the 2011 Census. With growth expected to rise further in the area, at the next census this is expected to be even higher. Amenities Armitage has a variety of village amenities including a Londis, a privately owned fishing shop, a corner newspaper shop, and the Croft Primary School. Armitage is also the home of Armitage Shanks. It has two churches, the larger being St. John the Baptist church located at the north end of the village. The organ of St John the Baptist church is of particular interest due to its size, age and history. The organ was built in 1789 for nearby Lichfield Cathedral, but moved here in 1865, commissioned by the then organist Josiah Spode (IV) who resided at nearby Hawkesyard estate, also known as Spode House. Etymology and location The name comes from the Middle English Ermitage, meaning 'Hermitage', in turn derived from the Old French ermitage, from a tradition that a hermit lived between the church and the River Trent. It does not appear in the Domesday Book, although Handsacre does. Armitage is now part of Armitage with Handsacre, although this is due to growth historically they were once separate villages. It lies close to Hill Ridware along with the Hamstall Ridware, Mavesyn Ridware, Pipe Ridware and Longdon. It lies close to the town of Rugeley and a few miles north of Lichfield. It is located on the West Coast Main Line, the nearest stop being Rugeley. With continuous growth in the area Armitage and Rugeley are growing closer together.

It is a traditional German bread eaten during the Christmas season, when it is called Weihnachtsstollen (after \\"Weihnachten\\", the German word for Christmas) or Christstollen (after Christ).  Ingredients  Stollen is a cake-like fruit bread made with yeast, water and flour, and usually with zest added to the dough. Orangeat (candied orange peel) and candied citrus peel (Zitronat),Duden: Zitronat, das raisins and almonds, and various spices such as cardamom and cinnamon are added. Other ingredients, such as milk, sugar, butter, salt, rum, eggs,Recipe for Dresdner Weihnachtsstollen Mimi Sheraton, The German Cookbook, from Random House vanilla, other dried fruits and nuts and marzipan, may also be added to the dough. Except for the fruit added, the dough is quite low in sugar. The finished bread is sprinkled with icing sugar. The traditional weight of Stollen is around , but smaller sizes are common. The bread is slathered with melted unsalted butter and rolled in sugar as soon as it comes out of the oven, resulting in a moister product that keeps better. The marzipan rope in the middle is optional. The dried fruits are macerated in rum or brandy for a superior-tasting bread. Dresden Stollen (originally Striezel), a moist, heavy bread filled with fruit, was first mentioned in an official document in 1474, and Dresdner Stollen remains notableMeyers Lexikon : \\"Besonders bekannt ist der Dresdner Stollen\\" (\\"the Dresden Stollen is especially well-known\\") and available ‚Äì amongst other places ‚Äì at the Dresden Christmas market, the Striezelmarkt. Dresden Stollen is produced in the city of Dresden and distinguished by a special seal depicting King Augustus II the Strong. This \\"official\\" Stollen is produced by only 150 Dresden bakers. History Stollen Early Stollen was different, with the ingredients being flour, oats and water.Von G√§nsen, Karpfen, Lebkuchen und Stollen Dtsch Med. Wochenschrift 2003;128: 2691‚Äì2694 (p. 4) As a Christmas bread stollen was baked for the first time at the Council of Trent in 1545, and was made with flour, yeast, oil and water. The Advent season was a time of fasting, and bakers were not allowed to use butter, only oil, and the cake was tasteless and hard. In the 15th century, in medieval Saxony (in central Germany, north of Bavaria and south of Brandenburg), the Prince Elector Ernst (1441‚Äì1486) and his brother Duke Albrecht (1443‚Äì1500) decided to remedy this by writing to the Pope in Rome. The Saxon bakers needed to use butter, as oil in Saxony was expensive, hard to come by, and had to be made from turnips. Pope Nicholas V (1397‚Äì1455), in 1450 denied the first appeal. Five popes died before finally, in 1490, Pope Innocent VIII (1432‚Äì1492) sent a letter, known as the \\"Butter-Letter\\", to the Prince. This granted the use of butter (without having to pay a fine), but only for the Prince-Elector and his family and household. Others were also permitted to use butter, but on the condition of having to pay annually 1/20th of a gold Gulden to support the building of the Freiberg Minster. The ban on butter was removed when Saxony became Protestant. Over the centuries, the bread changed from being a simple, fairly tasteless \\"bread\\" to a sweeter bread with richer ingredients, such as marzipan, although traditional Stollen is not as sweet, light and airy as the copies made around the world. Commercially made Stollen has become a popular Christmas food in Britain in recent decades, complementing traditional dishes such as mince pies and Christmas pudding. All the major supermarkets sell their own versions, and it is often baked by home bakers. Jay Rayner: Christmas taste test: stollen Dresden Stollen festival Augustus II the Strong, by Louis de Silvestre Every year Stollenfest takes place in Dresden. This historical tradition ended only in 1918 with the fall of the monarchy, and started again in 1994, but the idea comes from Dresden‚Äôs history. Dresden‚Äôs Christmas market, the Striezelmarkt, was mentioned in the chronicles for the first time in 1474. The tradition of baking Christmas Stollen in Dresden is very old. Christmas Stollen in Dresden was already baked in the 15th century. In 1560, the bakers of Dresden offered the rulers of Saxony Christmas Stollen weighing each as gift, and the custom continued. Augustus II the Strong (1670‚Äì1733) was the Elector of Saxony, King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. The King loved pomp, luxury, splendour and feasts. In 1730, he impressed his subjects, ordering the Bakers‚Äô Guild of Dresden to make a giant 1.7-tonne Stollen, big enough for everyone to have a portion to eat. There were around 24,000 guests who were taking part in the festivities on the occasion of the legendary amusement festivity known as Zeithainer Lustlager. For this special occasion, the court architect Matth√§us Daniel P√∂ppelmann (1662‚Äì1737), built a particularly oversized Stollen oven. An oversized Stollen knife also had been designed solely for this occasion.Stollen knife Today, the festival takes place on the Saturday before the second Sunday in Advent, and the cake weighs between three and four tonnes. A carriage takes the cake in a parade through the streets of Dresden to the Christmas market, where it is ceremoniously cut into pieces and distributed among the crowd, for a small sum which goes to charity. A special knife, the Grand Dresden Stollen Knife, a silver-plated knife, long weighing , which is a copy of the lost baroque original knife from 1730, is used to festively cut the oversize Stollen at the Dresden Christmas fair. The Grand Dresden Stollen Knife The largest Stollen was baked in 2010 by Lidl; it was long and was certified by the Guinness Book of World Records, at the railway station of Haarlem.

History Edingale was mentioned in the Domesday book as part of Derbyshire and belonging to Henry de Ferrers and being worth two shillings. The name of the village comes from Old English, with the meaning nook of land of Edins (or Eadwines) people.

In some countries, lanes are described as being on the 'inside' or the 'outside' of a road, and the location of the passing lanes will vary. In modern traffic planning, passing lanes on freeways are usually designed for through/express traffic, while the lanes furthest from the median of the road have entry/exit ramps. However due to routing constraints, some freeways may have ramps exiting from the passing lane; these are known as \\"left exits\\" in North America. A passing lane is commonly referred to as a \\"fast lane\\" because it is often used for extended periods of time for through traffic or fast traffic. In theory, a passing lane should be used only for passing, thus allowing, even on a road with only two lanes in each direction, motorists to travel at their own pace. A 2+1 road has a passing lane only in one direction, usually alternating each few kilometers. In practice, they are more like upgraded highways than motorways. Misuse and common practice in the United States An SUV prepares to pass a slower moving car, using a passing lane in rural Utah Common practice and most law on United States highways is that the left lane is reserved for passing and faster moving traffic, and that traffic using the left lane must yield to traffic wishing to overtake. The United States Uniform Vehicle Code states: > Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the normal speed of > traffic at the time and place and under the conditions then existing shall > be driven in the right-hand lane then available for traffic ... It is also illegal in many states in the US to use the \\"far left\\" or passing lane on a major highway as a traveling lane (as opposed to passing), or to fail to yield to faster moving traffic that is attempting to overtake in that lane. For example, Colorado's \\"Left Lane Law\\" states: > A person shall not drive a motor vehicle in the passing lane of a highway if > the speed-limit is sixty-five miles per hour or more unless such person is > passing other motor-vehicles that are in a non-passing lane... In some states, such as Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, and Washington, the center lanes on highways with three or more lanes in each direction are also passing lanes. In those states, no matter how many lanes there are on the highway, drivers must not leave the right-hand lane unless they are overtaking slower vehicles, making a left turn or exit, or obeying a move over law. In California, at least, there is no prohibition against cruising in the left lane. However, similar to the states below, slow traffic must stay right. In other states, such as Massachusetts, New Jersey,New Jersey Permanent Statutes Database Illinois,Illinois Compiled Statutes Pennsylvania, and others, it is illegal to fail to yield to traffic that seeks to overtake in the left lane, or to create any other \\"obstruction\\" in the passing lane that hinders the flow of traffic. As a result, heavy trucks are often prohibited from using the passing lane. The left lane is commonly referred to as the \\"fast lane\\", but that is not an accurate description of the lane's purpose. The left lane is the designated passing lane, however, vehicles in the left lane must obey the posted speed limits. A common problem arising from misuse of the left lane is speeding and tailgating. These actions create road rage and increase overall danger. A driver hoping to pass a slow motorist in the \\"fast lane\\" can be stuck in an awkward situation. One strategy is to signal a lane change toward the center median. Another is to flash headlights. A third, which is dangerous and illegal, is to drive very close to the \\"fast lane\\" driver's bumper (this is known as tailgating). Most commonly, motorists will attempt to overtake the outer car on the inner lane either to continue at a fast pace or to pass a car that is going too slowly in the passing lane. On high-capacity multilane freeways (three or more lanes per direction), many motorists often pass on the inner lane, largely in response to misuse of the \\"passing lane\\" by slower traffic. In some areas, such as the U.S. states of Colorado and Kentucky, vehicles in the left lane are required to yield to faster traffic only if the speed limit is above 65 miles per hour. In other areas, like Alaska, there is no law requiring slower traffic to move over for faster traffic. A map of the United States showing the lane discipline laws of each state. =Signage= A sign indicating that all vehicles shall be driven only in the right-hand lane unless overtaking slower vehicles. The use of passing lanes for faster traffic is sometimes acknowledged with signs using phrases such as \\"Slower Traffic Keep Right\\"You can drive on the left lane as long as you go fast Alberta, Canada Government - Road Signs (Slower Traffic Keep Right) (in Canada, where the passing lane is to the left). In a study by the AASHTO Subcommittee on Traffic Engineering, all 24 U.S. states involved used some form of passing lane courtesy signage, 9 of which only use those signs for steep graded roads.AASHTO Subcommittee on Traffic Engineering: Passing Lane Study =Proper use= Many areas which make it illegal to fail to yield to faster traffic also have exceptions to those rules. Some of these exceptions include preparing to make a left turn, taking an exit located on the left side of the roadway, avoiding traffic merging onto the roadway, or overtaking and passing another vehicle. In the province of Quebec, it is illegal to travel in the left lane when not passing when the speed limit is over 80 km/h (50 mph).https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe- drive/culture/commuting/left-lane-etiquette-and-tailgating- consequences/article4249182/?service=mobile In the province of Ontario, unless otherwise posted, the left lane on a multi-lane highway is not reserved for passing or to give motorists a special lane to violate the speed limit. Only vehicles traveling less than the posted speed limit are required to stay in the right most lane. Passing on the right is perfectly legal in Ontario on multi-lane highways. Truckers often use the passing lane in moderate traffic where legal to do so to reduce travel times, however in many areas, tractor trailers are banned from using the passing lane for safety reasons; these restrictions are normally found along urban, often congested highways with multiple lanes (e.g. Interstate 40 west of Raleigh, North Carolina), or on rural freeways with 6 or more lanes (3 in each direction). =Hammer lane= The hammer lane is another term for the passing lane. Its etymology originated with truckers in North America in reference to slamming the accelerator with a foot like hammer.) HOV lanes are not usually considered hammer lanes, but are also used for express travel by commuters. Climbing lane A sign directing slower traffic to remain in the right-hand lane. In hilly terrain, some undivided highways are built with three lanes, with the extra added pavement known as the \\"climbing lane\\" or \\"crawler lane\\". Two lanes are used for traffic heading in the uphill direction, with one lane being a passing or climbing lane, and one lane is used for downhill traffic. On dual carriageways, the climbing lane may be marked with a broken double white line.  Australian use  In Australia, most intercity highways are constructed with only one lane in each direction. Head-on collisions are a risk, particularly with fatigued drivers. Overtaking lanes are an additional lane in one direction for a short distance (one or two kilometres) to assist faster traffic to safely overtake slower traffic. Road markings are often painted so that the additional lane appears in the centre of the road (guiding traffic to the left), and traffic needs to deliberately change lanes to overtake. At the end, the markings are the other way, so that the left lane must yield and merge into the overtaking lane.

The settlement has five sections: the new Milton Road housing Development & West Adderbury towards the southwest; East Adderbury to the centre, both with a village green and a manor house; and the new housing Development on the Aynho Road; and the northeast, which is known as Twyford, named after a small outlying settlement by a forked section of the River Cherwell. East and West Adderbury are divided by the south- then east-flowing Sor Brook, a tributary of the Cherwell. Sor Brook rises at Ratley and Upton in Warwickshire and joins the Cherwell between Adderbury and Aynho, Northamptonshire, the latter river being the eastern parish boundary. The Oxford Canal and beyond which the Cherwell characterise the far east of the parish. The M40 motorway passes close to the northeast of Adderbury near Twyford wharf. Banbury Business Park and Banbury Golf Course are also in the eastern part of the parish. Railways briefly pass through the easternmost river meander, the combined Chiltern Main and Cherwell Valley Lines. Toponym The village toponym has had several changes of spelling. The earliest known record of it is in a document from the middle of the 10th century. The Domesday Book records it as Edburgberie, meaning \\"Eadburg's town\\". Places of worship ;Church of England Gothic piscina and sedilia in the chancel of St Mary's parish church The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary the Virgin is in East Adderbury. St Mary's is one of the largest parish churches in Oxfordshire and architecturally one of the most important. It is nicknamed the Cathedral of the Feldon. St Mary's building retains evidence of its 13th century origins but was enlarged in the 14th century and again in the Perpendicular style in the early 15th century. By 1611, St Mary's had a clock, for which there are records of repairs in 1617, 1621, 1626 and 1631. In 1684 it was replaced with a new clock, which with periodic repairs served the parish until late in the 19th century. It has since been replaced with a new clock built by John Smith and Sons of Derby, and little has been preserved of the 1684 clock except one shaft from the motion and the remains of one hand. In the 18th century, St Mary's fell into disrepair. In the 19th century restoration was carried out in phases: sensitively by the architect J.C. Buckler between 1831 and 1834 and by the architect Sir George Gilbert Scott between 1866 and 1870, and less sensitively by Sir George's son John Oldrid Scott in 1886. St Mary's had a ring of six bells until 1789, when John Briant of Hertford took them down and re-cast them into a ring of eight. The third bell was recast again in 1863, this time by George Mears and Company of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The sixth bell was recast again in 1927, this time by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough. St Mary's has also a Sanctus bell that was cast by Matthew I Bagley of Chacombe, Northamptonshire in 1681. St Mary's is a Grade I listed building. ;Methodist The Methodist Church in High Street was built in 1893. It is a member of the Banbury Methodist Circuit. ;Roman Catholic The Roman Catholic Saint George's chapel in Round Close Road in West Adderbury was built in 1956. =No longer in religious use= ;Society of Friends Former Friends' meeting house The former West Adderbury Friends meeting house was built in 1675 for Bray Doyley. This was before the Act of Toleration 1689 legalised Quaker worship in England, so Doyley was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for having had it built. Quaker meetings ceased in the early 20th century and the meeting house was leased to the Parish Council, who maintain the building but had the adjoining women's meeting house demolished in about 1955. Today, the Meeting House is used for up to four special Friends' meetings per year, as allowed by the Parish Council's lease. The meeting house is also used as a waiting room for the Parish Council's adjoining cemetery. The meeting house retains 18th century benches, elders' stand and gallery, and is a Grade II* listed building. Next to it are the walls of the Quaker burial ground, which are also probably 17th-century. ;Independent (former) Former Independent chapel in Cross Hill Road A former Independent chapel, self-governing and owing no allegiance to outside denominations was built in 1820 in Cross Hill Road in West Adderbury. The main door was widened when the chapel was converted to industrial use. Economic and social history New College tithe barn: 14th or early 15th century Adderbury West Manor House Near St Mary's is a tithe barn that was built for New College, Oxford. In the 1970s Jennifer Sherwood dated it mainly to the 14th century but English Heritage dates the earliest parts of the building to 1422. The walls are of ashlar marlstone and the roof is of Stonesfield slate. In the 17th century the barn was reduced to its present length of five bays and partly rebuilt. In about 1877 it was altered for Lawrence Palk, 1st Baron Haldon. The barn has similarities with tithe barns at Swalcliffe and Upper Heyford, both of which were also built for New College early in the 15th century. Because of its post-Medieval alterations it is only a Grade II listed building. Adderbury House is a country house in East Adderbury built in the 17th century. It was owned by Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester, who fought on the Royalist side during the English Civil War. Wilmot was a cavalry commander with Prince Rupert of the Rhine, and both men kept troops at Adderbury House. The poet Anne Wharton, wife of the Whig politician Thomas Wharton, 1st Marquess of Wharton, died there in 1685. Adderbury House has been remodelled several times: in 1661 for Anne Wilmot, Countess of Rochester, in 1722 for John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll, in 1731 by the architect Roger Morris and in 1768 by the architect Sir William Chambers for Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch. In early 1760s Lancelot 'Capability' Brown was asked to create a plan for the park & gardens at Adderbury for Jane, Duchess of Argyll. It is more likely that improvements to the landscape were overseen at a later date by Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch after he inherited the estate from her in 1767. Brown's account book shows a charge of ¬£42 for a journey to Adderbury & the preparation of plan 'for alteration of the Park & Gardens'. It is unclear how much, if any, of Brown's plans were implemented but when the estate was sold in 1774, the grounds consisted of 224 acres of flower gardens, parkland enclosed by belts of evergreens and forest trees and ‚Äúa fine serpentine stream of water in full view of the house‚Äù which was very much in his style. In mid 1850s owner William Hunt Chamberlin altered lake area & turned it into pleasure grounds with ornamental buildings & planting. Most of the house was demolished in 1808. In the 19th century, Adderbury House was owned by Major Larnach. When his Adderbury-trained horse Jeddah won the Derby at odds of 100‚Äì1 and also won at Ascot, the Major paid for the building of the Village Institute. This opened in 1898 and has been the setting of countless village events since, ranging from early instruction and sewing meetings to the present-day activities. Adderbury is noted for the many honey-coloured limestone cottages and houses in the older parts of the village. East Adderbury's manor house is 16th century and features diamond-patterned brick chimney-stacks. The Grange, also in East Adderbury, was built by John Bloxham of Banbury for Sir Thomas Cobb, first Baronet, of Banbury, in 1684. =Clockmakers= Adderbury's Quaker community included a number of clockmakers. Richard Gilkes (1715‚Äì87) was a son of Thomas Gilkes of Sibford Gower. Richard was apprenticed to his father and started his own business in Adderbury East in about 1736. Gilkes was a prolific clockmaker until the 1770s and maintained the turret clock of St Mary the Virgin parish church from 1747 until 1786. Joseph Williams (1762‚Äì1835) lived in Adderbury East and traded from 1788. Williams made longcase clocks and succeeded Richard Gilkes in the maintenance of the parish church clock, which he did from 1788 until 1827. His son William Williams (1793‚Äì1862) assisted him and took over the business on his father's death in 1835. He made longcase clocks and maintained the parish church clock from 1828 until 1839. Morris dancing Morris dancers at the Adderbury Day of Dance 2004, outside the Red Lion The existence of the traditional Adderbury Morris dancing side was first documented by Janet Blunt. In 1916 she began interviewing William \\"Binx\\" Walton, who was then 80 years old. Walton had been foreman of the Adderbury side for 20 years in the mid-19th century. In 1919 Blunt introduced Walton to Cecil Sharp, who watched Walton's performances and published detailed descriptions in his Morris Book. Subsequent researches have determined that there were once as many as three Morris sides in the village, and the names of more than two dozen of the 19th century dancers have been documented. During Whitsun week they performed in Adderbury and neighbouring villages. Sides regularly used to dance at Banbury Fair and the well-known Banbury eccentric, William 'Old Mettle' Castle, was fool for the Adderbury team in the 19th century. During this period the village had two or possibly three sides performing although this had died out by the 1880s. A revival side was established at the village school in the Edwardian era and some of the boys developed into a men's Morris side, prior to the First World War. There are pictures of this side and the names of the members were established, through talking to older village residents, in 1974. One of the dancers in the photographs, Charlie Coleman, was still alive at that time. Of those in the pictures, only Coleman returned from the war and that revival of Morris dancing in Adderbury therefore died with them. However the dances had been recorded from two of the last surviving members of the 19th century team, brothers William and John Walton, in such detail by Janet Blunt and others that they could still be performed by a newly formed revival team led by Bryan Sheppard and Tim Radford. The side split in 1975 to form two Morris dancing sides in Adderbury, the Adderbury Village Morris Men (dressed in white and green with top hats) ‚Äì whose members come from the village or surrounding parishes and only dance traditional dances from Adderbury ‚Äì and the Adderbury Morris Men (dressed in white, blue and red), who take dancers from anywhere and who occasionally create new dances to add to the repertoire. There is also now a women's side, named Sharp and Blunt after Cecil Sharp and Janet Blunt. The Adderbury tradition has become popular with groups of dancers from as far afield as the United States, Australia and India. Once a year both teams come together, with other guest sides, for a \\"Day of Dance\\" throughout the village. Amenities Village Shop and Library in the High Street. Banbury business park is a modest cluster of office and distribution buildings on Aynho Road in the east of the parish. Adderbury has a Church of England primary school: Christopher Rawlins School. Adderbury has four public houses: * Bell Inn, in High Street (Hook Norton Brewery). * Coach and Horses, by the Green (Wadworth Brewery). * Pickled Ploughman, formerly the Plough Inn, a free house in Aynho Road. * Red Lion, by the Green (Greene King Brewery). Adderbury village activities include Tennis and Squash, The Women's Institute, Photographic, Cinema, Cycling and Gardening Clubs, Conservation, and History Association, Adderbury Bowls, Football and Cricket Clubs, Adderbury Rainbows and 1st Adderbury Scouts, Mothers' Union, Over Sixties' Club, Gardening Club, and amateur dramatics (Adderbury Theatre Workshop). In 1977 a talent contest was held as part of Adderbury's celebrations of Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee. It was such a success that Adderbury Theatre Workshop was formed. Every year since then, the Village Institute has hosted several dramatic and musical performances including pantomimes, cabarets and plays. In 1984 members from Adderbury Theatre Workshop appeared at the Cropredy Festival where they performed the Pheasant Pluckers Song.

The Church  The wooden church in Hov was originally built in V√°gur on Kirkjukletti in 1862. It was moved to Hov in 1942. A new church was built in V√°gur, it was ready in 1939, after that they could start to take down the old church and move it to Hov, as it was promised 25 years earlier in 1914.Hov.fo  Hovstunnilin - The Hov-√òrav√≠k tunnel  In 2007 the road tunnel \\"Hovstunnilin\\" opened.pdf.istak.is It connects the villages Hov and √òrav√≠k, but it also connects the southern and the northern part of the island. Now it is not necessary to drive over the mountain, which can be difficult in wintertime. Now it takes only 15 minutes to drive from Tv√∏royri to V√°gur. The tunnel is 2.5 km long.  Viking History - Viking Chief Havgr√≠mur  The graves of Chieftain Havgr√≠mur and his horse. According to the Faroese Sagas and local tradition, the first Viking settler on Su√∞uroy established a farm in Hov, which is said to be named after his pagan hof. His grave is at \\"undir Homrum\\" in Hov and is the only chieftain burial site to be found on the Faroes. Hov lies in the middle of the island and the area is flat and wide with a good view out to sea. This enabled Su√∞uroy's first settlers to follow exactly what was happening on the sea around. The viking Havgr√≠mur who was chief of half of the country lived in Hov in the 10th century. His burial plot is located in the hills above the village, but was largely destroyed when opened in by amateur archaeologists in 1834.  The area west of Hov  West of Hov is a waterfall with the name Foldarafossur. It lies in Hovs√°, which runs from Vatnsnes and is the line of demarcation between the villages of Porkeri and Hov. The waterfall is formed at the place where Hovs√° runs over the edge at Foldarshamri, and a bit further to the south there is a mountain pass which is called Foldarsskar√∞. These three place names all have the same origin, and linguists think that the name comes from the soil (in Faroese also foldin) below these localities. Approx. 30 years ago, the electricity company SEV commenced construction work in Hovsdal, so that the hydropower could be converted into electricity, and a dam was built approx. ¬Ω km west of Foldarafoss. Therefore, the waterfall does not have the same power as before, but if it rains a lot, and water flows out over the dam, the waterfall may show some of its old power.  Myri Museum - The Old Shop  There is an old building down in the harbour of Hov, which now is a museum, an art gallery and a caf√©. The eastern part of the house is called Fiskastovan. The western part of the house has been a shop until sometime in 1980s. Other parts of the house and the area around it has been used for clip fish industry, the fish was dried outside the house on the flat stones. A white flag was raised in order to let people in the village know when there was work for them. That was before the phone was a possibility. The house was in bad shape a few years ago, but now it has been restored. Some interesting items and old books with peoples names and how much they earned etc. are still in the house. The house was first located in V√°gur, but it was moved to Hov, just like the church was.

Due to financial difficulties, production of the Th!nk City in Finland was stopped in March 2011, and the company filed for bankruptcy on June 22, 2011, for the fourth time in 20 years. Think Global was purchased soon after by Electric Mobility Solutions AS, which announced production to resume in early 2012 with a refined Think City. However, production never resumed, and the Indiana plant completed its final car in August 2012. __TOC__ History The production Think City is closely related to the trial Think City produced in 2001‚Äì2002 during Ford's ownership of the company. The Th!nk City was exhibited for the first time in the UK in July 2008. At the 2008 Geneva Motor Show, Think announced that the Th!nk City would be launched in Denmark and Sweden in 2008, followed by launching in the UK, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands in 2009. At the 2008 British International Motor Show at the ExCeL Exhibition Centre, London, THINK announced that the Th!nk City will be available to UK customers from the summer of 2009. Prime Minister Gordon Brown joined Transport Minister Geoff Hoon for a presentation by Managing Director of Think UK.

Think Global originally planned to start deliveries to Norwegian customers in the last quarter of 2007. That target was missed, but as of August 2008 some 100 electric cars had been manufactured for customers in Norway. On December 15, 2008, the carmaker suspended all vehicle production and laid off 50% of its staff pending negotiation of up to million in funding for working capital, citing \\"urgent financial distress.\\" Production of the Th!nk City restarted on December 10, 2009, at Valmet Automotive in Uusikaupunki, Finland. In October 2010 production had reached 2,500 units, making the Th!nk City one of the world's best selling pure electric cars. On November 24, 2010, Think North America began manufacturing in the Magnum Drive plant located in Elkhart, Indiana. Initially the Finland plant manufactures the body and wheels on the chassis, then ships them to the United States. The lithium-ion battery, made by EnerDel in Indianapolis, the motor and gearbox, seats, headlights and other components are assembled in the Elkhart plant. Each car takes about a week to complete. Due to financial difficulties, production of the Th!nk City in Finland was stopped in March 2011, and the company filed for bankruptcy in Norway on June 22, 2011, for the fourth time in 20 years. Although Think North America is a separate entity, its future also is in doubt because it is financially supported by the headquarters in Norway. Production in the Elkhart plant was halted a few days before the bankruptcy filing due to delays in the delivery of parts required to assemble the electric cars. Think Global's assets were bought by Electric Mobility Solutions AS in July 2011, including shares of wholly owned subsidiaries THINK North America and THINK UK. The new owners announced that production is scheduled to restart in early 2012 with a refined Think City. Sales and price Th!nk City exhibited at the 2010 Washington Auto Show.

Before the late 20th century the population was very low. Until the mid 19th century the entire population comprised one farm. A few more houses were built close to the farmland after the Second World War. A real development boom has been in Hoyv√≠k since about the early 1980s. The new houses have been built on land that was formerly considered the farmer's outfield. The architecture of some of these newer houses include detached and terraced housing. The purchaser of one of these terraced houses, buys the two outer walls, but then builds the house itself in colours and design of their own choice. The result is an unusual effect of combining terraced housing with the idiosyncratic personal ‚Äòtouch‚Äô of the family living in it.

The village spreads around the bottom of a deep inlet, Hvalbiarfj√∏r√∞ur, in the northeast of Su√∞uroy. Population Hvalba is one of the larger villages in the Faroe Islands. The total population of Hvalba Municipality (Hvalbiar Kommuna) was 723 as of 1 January 2010; the population of Hvalba and Nes was 626 and the population of Sandv√≠k was 97.Hagstova.fo The small village Nes is often called Nes-Hvalba, because there are two other villages with the same name. Nes is located on the southern arm of the fjord Hvalbiarfj√∏r√∞ur, opposite of Hvalba. Nes does not have its own postal code. Hvalba has one supermarket, a fast food shop and a few more shops. Some of the villagers work as coalminers; Hvalba is the only place in the Faroes which still has active coalmine industry, although in very small scale. There are two harbours and some fish factories in Hvalba, both harbours are on the northern side of the bay. There is a boat harbour in Nes and a small harbour in Sandv√≠k. The municipality plans to make a new marina between the two harbors on a place which is called √Å Hamranesi. Some trawlers belong to the village, they deliver fish for the fish factory. Some people work in other villages i.e. at the Suduroy Hospital in Tv√∏royriSSH.fo or at the Faroe Islands Ferry and Buss Transportation Company including the ferry Smyril, which sails between Su√∞uroy and T√≥rshavn,SSL.fo but there are also a few independent small companies in Hvalba, i.e. IT supporters, carpenters, transport company, dietitian, internet shop etc.Hvalba.fo , Fyrit√∏kur Hvalba is located on the east side of the island but the inlet is so deep that the distance to the west coast is quite short, so the island almost splits into two islands. There are two isthmuses in Hvalba: Hvalbiarei√∞i (also called Fiskiei√∞i) and Nor√∞bergsei√∞i (also called √Å Dr√°tti). There is a memorial in Hvalba, it is located on the northern side of the fjord, just before one comes to the first harbour, not far from the bottom of the bay. The memorial is made of stone, the stone work was made by Lars and Helmut Larsen from T√≥rshavn, it was raised in 1963 in memory of people from Hvalba who lost their life at sea or by other accidents, i.e. by accidents in the coal mines or by falling down from the island L√≠tla D√≠mun or from one of the mountains which surround the village.  Connected by tunnels  Two tunnels connect Hvalba to its neighbouring villages. The southbound Hvalbiartunnilin (1450 m) leads to Trongisv√°gur and Tv√∏royri. The northbound Sandv√≠kartunnilin (1500 m) leads to Sandv√≠k.Landsverk.fo Construction of a new tunnel to Trongisv√°gur started in 2019 and will finish in 2021.  Hvalbiarei√∞i and Nor√∞bergsei√∞i  On the west coast there is a place of call that makes it possible to go fishing in small boats from both sides of the island. The place has two names; it is called Hvalbiarei√∞i or Fiskiei√∞i. The name Hvalbiarei√∞i refers to the name of the village Hvalba, Fiskiei√∞i refers to the fact that this place used to be a fish harbour. There are still a few boat houses there, but most of them are ruins. Most of the men of Hvalba are member of the crews of one of the trawlers of the village. Many people from Hvalba own their share of these trawlers. There is another \\"Ei√∞i\\" in Hvalba, it is called Nor√∞bergsei√∞i, named after a mountain nearby, which is called Nor√∞berg. Nor√∞bergsei√∞i is the northern one of the two \\"eidi\\". Nor√∞bergsei√∞i and Hvalbiarei√∞i are separated by the mountain Gr√≠msfjall (the Mountain of Gr√≠mur).  Tourism  Tourism has been developing over the past few years. Some people from Hvalba started to arrange boat trips to the uninhabited island L√≠tla D√≠mun in 2009,Visitsuduroy.fo and the same year some men from Hvalba started to offer s√≠ging, which is a kind of rappelling (abseiling) for tourists on Nor√∞bergsei√∞i.Visitsuduroy.fo There have also been arranged BBQ evenings with blues music on Fiskiei√∞i combined with boat trips along the cliffs of Hvalba and rappelling.Sudurras1.com The coal mines are also a tourist attraction. There are high mountains around Hvalba, some tourists enjoy going for hiking trips from Nes-Hvalba via the gorge K√°ragj√≥gv to Trongisv√°gur. There are cairns, which people can follow. Before the tunnel came in 1963 the path along the cairns was the only way to get from Hvalba to Trongisv√°gur and the part of the island which is south of Hvalba. There are now public toilets in Hvalba and in Sandv√≠k.  Coal Mines  In the mountains around the southbound tunnel brown coal has been extracted from mines since the 1770s. The coal was an important source of energy on the Faroe Islands until the end of World War II. A few miners are still extracting coal from the mines. Today there is only one active coal mine left. They closed down one of the older mines early in 2010 and started to excavate a new one in 2010.  Pirates and \\"Turkargravir\\"  Pirates ravaged Hvalba, as other villages on Su√∞uroy, in the 17th century. In 1629 three North-African pirate ships attacked the village. When they left the village after the ravage two of the ships ran aground on some rocks and were shattered by the surf. Tradition says that more than 300 bodies washed ashore. By the shore there is a place called ‚ÄòTurkargravir‚Äô. Here all the bodies were buried. 30 women and children were taken away to be sold as slaves in North Africa. On the Faroe Islands a collection was organized to raise enough money to buy back the people. This was not successful and the people never returned to the islands.

It helps writers and editors to think about how to make written communication clearer (or, in some cases, at least how to make it immune from pedantic editorial disparagement by avoiding the pedants' trigger points). It was first published in 1984 with the title The Penguin Dictionary of Troublesome Words () in the United Kingdom and with the title The Facts on File Dictionary of Troublesome Words () in the United States. It was republished in a revised edition in 1987; and again in the UK in 1997 under the title Troublesome Words (). In 2002 it was published as Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words. As the author states, \\"This book might more accurately, if less convincingly, have been called A Guide to Everything in English Usage That the Author Wasn't Entirely Clear About Until Quite Recently.\\" Bryson describes the English language as a valuable entity, with no two experts agreeing on any point of usage, claiming that those guides that do exist for the common user often expect the reader to be familiar with grammatical terms not encountered since (or even at) high school. Using almost forty standard works on the subject as his guide, Bryson aims to produce a list of difficult English words that is generally readable and informative while also usable as a reference work. This aim is accomplished using a large degree of humour as well as a willingness to hold the experts he quotes up to the light for their own failings, thus illustrating how easy it is to make errors of usage, or at least to fail to adhere to preferable or optimal usage. Like all other major usage advice books, it reflects the language epistemology of professional editors, which is not completely coincident with that of linguistic scientists. It makes use of both linguistic prescription and linguistic description, attempting to avoid the pathological extremes of prescription (valueless pedantry such as hypercorrection) while also making use of its helpful side (which encourages critical thinking).

Natal astrology can be found in the Indian or Jyotish, Chinese and Western astrological traditions. In horoscopic astrology an individual's personality is determined by the construction of the horoscope or birth chart for the particular individual involved (known as the native), showing the positions of the sun, moon, planets, ascendant, midheaven, and the angles or aspects among them. Once the horoscope has been constructed the process of interpretation can begin, which involves building a complete picture of the personality of the subject, or native. Interpretation involves three main steps: noting the important features of the chart, and the processes of chart weighting and chart shaping. Chart weighting involves noting the distribution of zodiac signs and houses in the chart, and the significance of this to the overall personality of the native. Chart shaping involves assessing the placement of the planets by aspect and position in the chart, and noting any significant patterns which occur between them. Astrology is generally considered a pseudoscience by the scientific community. What little statistical evidence exists fails to show a causation between natal birth charts and real world consequences. Important features The important features of every chart that the astrologer must give special attention to are the positions of the sun and moon by sign and house; the sign on the ascendant, and the planet that rules that sign, called the ascendant ruler or chart ruler. Also important is the first planet to occupy the first, second, or third houses after the ascendant. Called the rising planet it will be particularly strong in the chart. If no planet occupies the first three houses, then a planet in the twelfth house close to the ascendant can be taken to be the rising planet. Planets that are in conjunction to (right beside) the primary angles of ascendant, midheaven, descendant, or IC (known as angular planets) must also be especially considered. Chart weighting Chart weighting begins by listing the sun, moon, planets, ascendant, and midheaven by categories of sign and house and noting the significant categories which appear. For example, a large number of planets appearing in fire signs will give importance or 'weight' to fire sign attributes in the native's personality.Sasha Fenton, Understanding Astrology, pp78 - 84, pp141-2, Aquarian Press, London, 1991 =Weighting by sign= Chart weighting by sign lists the zodiac signs by three main categories - by masculine or feminine signs; by element (fire, earth, air and water) and by quality (cardinal, fixed and mutable). Some astrologers use all ten or eleven planets in the list and nothing else; while others include the ascendant and midheaven, but exclude the modern planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto on the grounds that their influence is felt by whole generations and so their position by sign cannot have much significance in the individual chart. Jeff Mayo, Teach Yourself Astrology, pp122-23, Hodder and Stoughton, London, 1979 Western Astrology. { border=\\"2\\" Sign Symbol Element Quality ---- Aries 20px Fire Cardinal ---- Taurus 20px Earth Fixed ---- Gemini 20px Air Mutable ---- Cancer 20px Water Cardinal ---- Leo 20px Fire Fixed ---- Virgo 20px Earth Mutable ---- Libra 20px Air Cardinal ---- Scorpio 20px Water Fixed ---- Sagittarius 20px Fire Mutable ---- Capricorn 20px Earth Cardinal ---- Aquarius 20px Air Fixed ---- Pisces 20px Water Mutable } *Masculine (Fire and Air signs): The masculine signs are Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and Aquarius. A native with these signs predominating will tend towards extroversion, confidence and assertiveness, and have the ability to solve problems with courage and enterprise. *Feminine (Earth and Water signs): The feminine signs are Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces. A native with these signs predominating will tend towards introversion, shyness and passivity, and have the ability to nurture, conserve and solve problems by intuitive means. *Fire: The fire signs are Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. A native with mainly fire signs will be energetic, enthusiastic and optimistic, with a need to be in the center of the action making things happen. They can be egotistical, headstrong and sometimes arrogant, but also can be generous, warm-hearted, and spontaneously kind. Fire subjects are independent and prefer to have control over their own lives, but they can also be sometimes autocratic. A subject lacking fire signs will be fearful or over-cautious, pessimistic and shy, and will lack enthusiasm, confidence and faith in the future. Planets in the 1st, 5th and 9th houses and an emphasis on cardinal signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack. *Earth: The earth signs are Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. A native with mainly earth signs will be practical and cautious, sensible and capable and will be happier with concrete things than abstract ideas. They move slowly and carry out their work in a thorough and unhurried manner. Earth subjects are shrewd and careful and need emotional and material security, and will put up with quite a lot to get it. They are generous to those they love, but are otherwise careful not to waste time or money, though there can be a tendency towards meanness. Earth subjects tend to be shy in social situations, and to be slow to commit in love relationships, but are serious when they do. A subject lacking earth signs will lack common sense and practicality and find it difficult to finish anything they start. They may be scatty, unrealistic and clumsy, hopeless with money and unreliable. Planets in the 2nd, 6th and 10th houses and an emphasis on fixed signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack. *Air : The air signs are Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius. A native with mainly air signs will be an excellent communicator, concerned with ideas and theories of all kinds. They are looking for answers to life's questions and make good teachers and writers. Air people are more tense than they appear at first sight and may live on their nerves. They have many friends and acquaintances but may not be particularly interested in family life. They are interested in the latest technologies and are able to do a number of things at once. Air subjects are also very imaginative and quick- witted, but may be sarcastic and rude. A subject lacking air signs will have little imagination and lightness of touch. They have an over-emphasis on practicalities and can lack a sense of humour, and be boring company. They can find it difficult to communicate or to assimilate and explain new ideas. Planets in the 3rd, 7th and 11th houses, and an emphasis on mutable signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack. *Water: The water signs are Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. A native with mainly water signs will be very emotional and find it hard to look at anything dispassionately. They tend to respond slowly to questions and need time to grasp a new concept. Water subjects can find it difficult to explain their feelings, and so can be difficult to live with, but they are also kind and sympathetic to those they love. They need to give and receive a lot of affection and will direct it towards family, close friends and animals. A subject lacking water may lack intuition and be unable to see the needs of others. They may be too full of ideas or too fond of the material world to consider their own spiritual needs or those of other people. Planets in the 4th, 8th and 12th houses in the chart will help to compensate for this lack. *Cardinal: The cardinal signs are Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn. A native with mainly cardinal signs will not want to be held under anybody's thumb, and will need to take charge of their own world. Their attention may be concerned with themselves or others, but wherever their energies are directed it is difficult to deflect them from their chosen course. Cardinal signs in a chart will add courage, initiative and self-motivation. Cardinal subjects are hard to influence because they generally believe they know best. A subject lacking cardinal signs may feel they are never in control of their own lives, but are manipulated by people and circumstances beyond their control. They may lack courage and initiative and may prefer others to make decisions for them. Planets in the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses, and an emphasis on fire and air signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack. *Fixed: The fixed signs are Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius. A native with mainly fixed signs has the strength and endurance to see things through and to uphold the status quo. They need stable homes, careers and partnerships and prefer the known to uncertainty. Fixed subjects are loyal and dependable but can be very obstinate. A subject lacking fixed signs cannot stick with anything or see anything through, and will tend to walk away from problems. They may be too easily bored or too busy chasing rainbows ever to make anything substantial happen. Planets in the 2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th houses, or an emphasis on earth in the chart will help to compensate for this lack. *Mutable: The mutable signs are Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces. A native with mainly mutable signs are adaptable, co- operative and friendly. They can fit into almost any situation, put up with anything and turn any situation to their advantage. Mutable people can steer projects through periods of transition and bring them to a successful conclusion. Although gentle and likeable, mutable subjects seem to have more than their fair share of problems and can be selfish and ruthless when they feel threatened. These subjects may devote their lives to helping others, but they can often paradoxically be surprisingly selfish at the same time. Subjects lacking mutable signs may be unable to adapt to any kind of change and be particularly unhappy when faced with uncertainty. They need much notice before they will commit themselves to anything, and lack flexibility and adaptability. They may also hold onto rigid and unchanging views. Planets in the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses will help to compensate for this lack, and water signs in the chart will make up for the lack of intuition. =Chart signature= Some astrologers summarise the process of weighting by sign through creating what is called the chart signature.Robert Pelletier and Leonard Cataldo, Be Your Own Astrologer, pp44 - 47, Pan Books, London, 1984 This involves noting which element and quality has the most signs and then combining them into a zodiac sign which is taken to be the signature sign of the chart. So for example, if a person has more fire signs than any other element, and more fixed signs than any other quality, then that person's signature is Leo (the sign which is both fire and fixed). In some cases there is no clear majority in either element or quality to give a clear signature. In these cases the ruling planet of the sun is noted for its position in the chart (alternatively, the ascendant can be added at this stage if it has not already been included). Whatever sign the ruling planet occupies is then added to the totals for element and quality. So for example, if the Sun is in Taurus, its ruling planet Venus is noted for its position by sign. If Venus is in, say, Pisces, then an additional 'casting vote' is given to the element water and quality mutable. This is usually enough to provide a signature. A 'casting vote' is given in this way on account of the extra importance of the Sun in the natal chart. The signature sign is regarded by those astrologers who use it as frequently having an over-riding influence in the natal chart, irrespective of what sign the sun or ascendant occupies. =Weighting by house= *Angular houses : These are the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th houses. Planets in these houses exert a strong influence on the subject, and may compensate for a lack of cardinal signs, and strength, courage and enthusiasm elsewhere in the chart. *Succedent houses : These are the 2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th houses. These houses are concerned with possessions and creative pursuits, either by those of the subject alone, or with others. Planets in these houses may help to compensate for a lack of fixed signs in the chart. *Cadent houses : These are the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses. Planets in these houses have a lot to do with the subject developing their own unique talents and aptitudes; and may compensate for a lack of mutable signs, and general adaptability in the chart. Chart shaping The ascendant in this sample chart is marked Asc and is in the traditional nine o'clock position of the horoscope Chart shaping involves examining the placement of the planets in the chart by the aspects they form and by their positioning in the chart relative to one another. Any significant patterns or 'shapes' which occur in the chart are then interpreted for their importance to the personality of the native. =Aspect patterns= While the astrologer must note every aspect formed by the planets, aspects can be grouped together into larger patterns which must be given particular attention in the chart. The main aspect patterns are as follows:Robert Pelletier and Leonard Cataldo, Ibid, pp166-68, 1984 *Stellium: At least three planets linked together in a series of continuous conjunctions. The planets will act as if they are all in conjunction with each other, even if not all of them actually are. This pattern gives a huge emphasis to the sign occupied by the planets, regardless of the sun sign. *Grand trine: Three trine aspects together. Indicative of a person at ease with him or herself, with strong inner harmony, talents and abilities. However it may make a person unable to cope with any real adversity, and may produce a weak, apathetic and condescending character. *Grand cross: Two pairs of opposing planets squared to each other. Often proves to be a \\"make or break\\" pattern; either the person develops unusual strength of character, or feels crushed by life. Person will have \\"a cross to bear\\". *T-Square: Two planets in opposition squared to a third. The tension typical of the opposition aspect is aggravated by additional problems introduced by the third planet. Often an obstructive feature blocking the normal flow of behaviour of the person. Person needs to develop activities represented by the \\"missing\\" arm of the T-square to achieve wholeness. *Yod: Two quincunxes together joined by a sextile. It indicates restlessness and instability. The person gets drawn into the lives of others in ways that are difficult to avoid, with periodic crises and urgent calls for assistance. =Hemispheres= The houses are grouped into four main categories or hemispheres.Sasha Fenton, Ibid, pp68 - 70, 1991 Horoscopes appear 'upside down' in relation to how the compass points usually appear, with the ascendant marking the eastern horizon traditionally appearing on the left hand side. For this reason the southern hemisphere appears in the upper part of the horoscope. *Upper (southern) hemisphere The 7th, 8th, 9th 10th, 11th and 12th houses. A subject with most of his or her planets in this hemisphere will not be too deeply affected by the actions of other people. He or she will be able to distance themselves from those around them and from public events and movements, focusing firmly on their own needs and feelings, or the general cause of humanity that is important to them. If the planets are grouped in the 8th, 9th or 12th houses, the subject will have strong spiritual needs and values. Planets grouped in the 10th house will make the subject ambitious and politically astute; while if they are in the 11th house he or she will be interested in humanitarian causes and education. *Lower (northern) hemisphere The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th houses. A subject with most of his or her planets in this part of the chart will be sensitive to the moods and feelings of others, and may suffer a good deal as a result. The person may try to live through their family rather than for themselves, and may be too subjective in their thinking. They may also choose to do most of their thinking and working at home. *Eastern hemisphere The 10th, 11th, 12th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd houses. A subject who has most of his or her planets in this hemisphere will be a self- starter who chooses their own path through life and sets their own boundaries. They are not happy being a burden to other people, or being kept by someone else. They also have the burden themselves of being an initiator at work and in their personal life, as little is likely to be done for them by others. When the planets are in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd houses, the subject is likely to be very self-absorbed and convinced that his or her own opinions are the only ones that matter. *Western hemisphere The 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th houses. A subject with most of these planets in this hemisphere will need to be very diplomatic in order to keep those around him on their side. They may be looked after in some way by others, or else spend their lives supporting and motivating others. When the majority of planets are in the 6th, 7th and 8th houses he or she will use their energy to fulfil the needs to others. The subject may bring about a situation of being needed by bringing a number of children into the world to love and care for. =Jones patterns= The American astrologer Marc Edmund Jones has listed seven significant patterns which also occur in the chart, based on the positions of the planets relative to one another.Robert Pelletier and Leonard Cataldo, Ibid, pp 162-5, 1984 ; Derek and Julia Parker, The New compleat Astrologer, pp 172-3, Crescent Books, New York, 1990 *Bundle : In this pattern the planets are grouped together so that they form a 'bundle' within the space of 120 degrees, or the equivalent of four signs of the zodiac. This intense concentration of planets produces a person who is equally intense and unrelenting in pursuit of personal interests. Perspective and understanding of others is limited, and it is difficult for this person to share their lives with anyone. The best course of life for such a person is to enter into enterprises that require deep concentration, persistence and commitment, or to specialise in one area of expertise. *Bowl : In this pattern the planets are grouped into a 'bowl' of one hemisphere of 180 degrees, or the equivalent of six zodiac signs. The pattern will have particular force if all the planets are contained within one hemisphere. A person with this pattern will be self-contained, and go in search of enterprises that are meaningful, fulfilling and personally relevant. They tend to have a ministerial quality that seeks the right kind of career or vocation that will produce the greatest benefit for themselves and others. *Bucket : This pattern is similar to the bowl except that one of the planets is in the opposite hemisphere to all the others. This lone planet, or Singleton, serves as a handle, thus creating a 'bucket' form. The bucket pattern indicates a desire to become associated with activity in the mainstream of society, so that the person feels they belong. However, what this often means is that the person expects the world to discover their own unique talents, rather than them trying to fit in. They will usually direct their efforts to a single purpose, and strive to achieve objectives rather than act solely for their own self-preservation. The person will probably behave according to the nature of the Singleton planet that forms the handle of the pattern. This planet will exercise a greater influence than normal in the chart, and will be an important part of the dynamic of the person's activities and basic energy. *Seesaw : In this pattern the planets form two groups on opposite sides of the chart, the groups no less than sixty degrees or two signs apart. As its name suggests, this produces a person who behaves like a 'seesaw', with their life following a pattern of two distinctly contrasting alternatives. The person can find it difficult to integrate these two sharply different parts of their life, which are often in competition with each other. However, success produces the increased sophistication and polished, knowing demeanour of a person who is able to deal with most of life's situations. *Locomotive : This pattern is produced when all the planets are contained within 240 degrees or nine signs of the zodiac, so that a whole 120 degrees is completely unoccupied. The planet that rises clockwise following the empty space will significantly influence the life of the person with this pattern, no matter what is indicated by the sun sign. It will act as the 'locomotive' of the natal chart, driving the individual to achieve goals through determined and unrelenting effort, with an exceptional drive and fund of energy at their disposal. Such a person will often be a loner, waiting for the public to discover the truth of what they have been saying all along. *Splay : This type of natal chart is noteworthy because of the presence of at least two, but usually three pairs (or conjunctions) of planets randomly distributed in a 'splay' shape around the chart. A person with this pattern will have enormous talent and potential that needs deliberate attention to be developed into worthwhile skills. The person will be an individualist, with no desire for a regimented or highly organized way of life, and they will seek to avoid becoming trapped in routine. However, there is often the difficulty that there is a lack of relevance between the different skill sets, so that the person may not derive the full benefit from them. Such a person needs to concentrate on 'getting their act together'. *Splash : As its name suggests this pattern, or rather lack of pattern, occurs when the planets are randomly distributed around the chart in a 'splash'. A person with this pattern will have diversification as their number one asset, with a universal and enriching mental outlook on life. The person will be eager to share their life and resources as universally as possible, wherever the need is greatest. However, as with the splay pattern, there is a danger of the person scattering their energy unproductively.  Scientific appraisal  =Carlson's experiment= Shawn Carlson's double-blind chart matching tests, in which 28 astrologers agreed to match over 100 natal charts to psychological profiles generated by the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) test, is one of the most renowned tests of astrology.My former student Shawn Carlson published in Nature magazine the definitive scientific test of Astrology. \\"... a perfectly convincing and lasting demonstration.\\" The experimental protocol used in Carlson's study was agreed to by a group of physicists and astrologers prior to the experiment. Astrologers, nominated by the National Council for Geocosmic Research, acted as the astrological advisors, and helped to ensure, and agreed, that the test was fair. They also chose 26 of the 28 astrologers for the tests, the other 2 being interested astrologers who volunteered afterwards. The astrologers came from Europe and the United States. The astrologers helped to draw up the central proposition of natal astrology to be tested. Published in Nature in 1985, the study found that predictions based on natal astrology were no better than chance, and that the testing \\"clearly refutes the astrological hypothesis\\". =Dean and Kelly= The scientist and former astrologer, Geoffrey Dean and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted a large scale scientific test, involving more than one hundred cognitive, behavioural, physical and other variables, but found no support for astrology. Furthermore, a meta-analysis was conducted pooling 40 studies consisting of 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts. Ten of the tests, which had a total of 300 participating, involved the astrologers picking the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others which were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually 3 to 5 others). When the date and other obvious clues were removed no significant results were found to suggest there was any preferred chart. A further test involved 45 confident astrologers, with an average of 10 years experience and 160 test subjects (out of an original sample size of 1198 test subjects) who strongly favoured certain characteristics in the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire to extremes. The astrologers performed much worse than merely basing decisions off the individuals age, and much worse than 45 control subjects who did not use birth charts at all. =Mars effect= The initial Mars effect finding, showing the relative frequency of the diurnal position of Mars in the birth charts (N = 570) of \\"eminent athletes\\" (red solid line) compared to the expected results [after Michel Gauquelin 1955] In 1955, astrologer, and psychologist Michel Gauquelin stated that although he had failed to find evidence to support such indicators as the zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology, he had found positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some of the planets and success in professions (such as doctors, scientists, athletes, actors, writers, painters, etc.) which astrology traditionally associates with those planets. The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the \\"Mars effect\\". A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence. They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study. Geoffrey Dean has suggested that the effect may be caused by self-reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin. The suggestion is that a small subset of the parents may have had changed birth times to be consistent with better astrological charts for a related profession. The sample group was taken from a time where belief in astrology was more common. Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in more recent populations, where a nurse or doctor recorded the birth information. The number of births under astrologically undesirable conditions was also lower, indicating more evidence that parents choose dates and times to suit their beliefs.

Admissions In the academic year 2016-17 it had 2000 full-time students. The catchment area spreads across several areas of the North West of England, incorporating much of Wigan, Bolton, Preston, Salford, West Lancashire, Chorley, Warrington, St. Helens, Sefton and Knowsley. Winstanley College is highly oversubscribed due to its good Ofsted Reports and A-Level performance. Buildings The College has undergone a major re-development; including the building of a part student-designed English and Politics building, and the Head of Politics Elaine Mulroy has received an award for the top teacher of Politics within England and Wales. Points of interest when visiting the college include: * The Art and Psychology Departments for their imaginative architecture * The Student Centre. * The English and Politics/Law/Sociology (PLS) building (including subject-specific study areas). * Learning Resource Centre (LRC). * Extensive Sporting and Gym facilities including several large sports fields. * A brand new ¬£3 million development for Media, Music & Performing Arts opened July 2012. Architects Pick Everard have won Best Education Building Design and Best Overall Design in Wigan for 2012. Student Union College buildings Winstanley College Students' Union is an independent union and a member of the National Union of Students. The student union is run by the Student Union Executive. Usually, each member of the Student Union Executive is a second- year student, elected by Lower Sixth students, going into the Upper Sixth year. History =Grammar school= The College began life as Upholland Grammar School, which was founded in 1661. The grammar school moved to its present site on Winstanley Road in Billinge Higher End in September 1953. It had 600 boys and girls in the 1960s and had 750 by 1976. During World War II the grammar school had its own Air Cadet Squadron ‚Äì 1439 (Beacon) squadron with the headmaster Alfred Maggs BA MSc as the first commanding officer (Flt Lt A. Maggs RAFVR(T)). =Sixth form college= It was renamed Winstanley College in August 1977, and at that time, it ceased to enrol new pupils at age 11, gradually becoming a sixth form college. By September 1981, no pupils remained in the lower forms, and the transformation to a sixth-form college was complete. In early 2009, plans were unveiled for an extensive redevelopment of the grounds, which was subsequently put to the Learning & Skills Council for approval. In mid-2009 the project was shelved for lack of grant funding. Since that time the college has redeveloped the 1950s buildings by replacing its flat roofs (AA projects & Mitie roofing), the music block was replaced with a ¬£3m building for media and performing arts which was completed in 2012 (Pick Everard and ISG). A replacement library block and new accommodation for physical sciences and biology were completed in 2014. In March 2019, a new social sciences building was opened, home to sociology, psychology, health and social care and in 2019/20 to the new criminology A level. Academic performance A portal to higher education, Winstanley College is at the forefront of the top 10 colleges in the UK in terms of A-level PPS (points per student) ‚Äî ranked 1st in the Guardian's country-wide collation of A-Level results in 2010. It was named by the Sunday Times as Sixth Form of the Year in 2012 for consistently achieving excellent A-level results over a long period of time. The report highlights the fact that Winstanley are A-level specialists with the expertise to deliver consistent academic excellence with large numbers of students drawn from a wide area.

Trongisv√°gur and the neighbouring villages Tv√∏royri and √òrav√≠k have grown into one entity (the northern part of √òrav√≠k, which is called √òrav√≠karl√≠√∞, is where the ferry port Krambatangi is). A river called St√≥r√° that runs through the valley passes through a plantation that is worth visiting on a good day and then flows into the inlet at a nearby beach. There is a debate whether the name Trong is Norse or Gaelic in origin. Another version of the name is Trungisv√°gur. Trungisv√°gsbotnur is on the west coast, west of Trongisv√°gur. There are binoculars there in summertime, so people can have a closer look at birds and the vertical cliffs there. The place is called √Å R√∏√∞ini, but some people call it Kikarin, because of the binoculars. Shortly after the Park of Trongisv√°gur is the tunnel to Hvalba, Hvalbiartunnilin, which was the first road tunnel in the Faroe Islands. It was dug in 1963 and is 1450 metres long.

It is the belief that the position and motion of celestial objects can be used to predict both seasonal climate and weather. Throughout most of its history astrometeorology was considered a scholarly tradition and was common in academic circles, often in close relation with astronomy, alchemy, meteorology, medicine, and other types of astrology. Meteorological phenomena correlated to planetary configurations were recorded in Babylonia. Classical astrologers of note such as Claudius Ptolemy constructed a treatise on forecasting weather via astrological means. Astrometeorology is the oldest type of Hellenistic astrology. Johannes Kepler recorded meteorological observations to support his belief that the conjunction of Saturn and the Sun would produce cold weather. In 1686 a large volume written in English was devoted to astrometeorology by John Goad in his book Astro-Meteorologica published in London, England. Astrometeorological societies persisted in Great Britain until the mid-19th century but were not taken seriously by mainstream scientists. Farmers in India during the 21st century have used a form of astrometeorology based on Nakshatra that is not considered a viable practice.

It is named after the kalam (medieval Islamic scholasticism) from which its key ideas originated. It was popularized in the western world by William Lane Craig in his book, The KalƒÅm Cosmological Argument (1979). The argument's key underpinning idea is the metaphysical impossibility of actual infinities and of a temporally past-infinite universe, traced by Craig to 11th-century Persian Muslim scholastic philosopher Al- Ghazali. This feature distinguishes it from other cosmological arguments, such as that of Thomas Aquinas, which rests on the impossibility of a causally ordered infinite regress, and those of Leibniz and Samuel Clarke, which refer to the Principle of Sufficient Reason. Since Craig's original publication, the Kalam cosmological argument has elicited public debate between Craig and Graham Oppy, Adolf Gr√ºnbaum, J. L. Mackie and Quentin Smith, and has been used in Christian apologetics.Graham Smith, ‚ÄúArguing about the Kalam Cosmological Argument,‚Äù Philo, 5(1), 2002: 34‚Äì61. See also: Reichenbach, 2004 According to Michael Martin, the cosmological arguments presented by Craig, Bruce Reichenbach, and Richard Swinburne are \\"among the most sophisticated and well argued in contemporary theological philosophy\\".Martin, 1990: 101 Form of the argument The most prominent form of the argument, as defended by William Lane Craig, states the Kalam cosmological argument as the following brief syllogism:Craig and Moreland, 2009: 102 #Whatever begins to exist has a cause. #The universe began to exist. #Therefore, the universe has a cause. Given the conclusion, Craig appends a further premise and conclusion based upon a conceptual analysis of the properties of the cause:Craig and Moreland, 2009: 194 #The universe has a cause. #If the universe has a cause, then an uncaused, personal Creator of the universe exists who sans (without) the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and enormously powerful. #Therefore, an uncaused, personal Creator of the universe exists, who sans the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and infinitely powerful. Referring to the implications of Classical Theism that follow from this argument, Craig writes:Craig, 2000: 149 :\\"... transcending the entire universe there exists a cause which brought the universe into being ex nihilo ... our whole universe was caused to exist by something beyond it and greater than it. For it is no secret that one of the most important conceptions of what theists mean by 'God' is Creator of heaven and earth.\\" Historical background The Kalam cosmological argument is based on the concept of the prime-mover, introduced by Aristotle, and entered early Christian or Neoplatonist philosophy in Late Antiquity, being developed by John Philoponus.Duncan, S., Analytic Philosophy of Religion: Its History Since 1955 (2010), Humanities-Ebooks, p. 165. Along with much of classical Greek philosophy, the concept was adopted into medieval Islamic tradition, where it received its fullest articulation at the hands of Muslim scholars, most directly by Islamic theologians of the Sunni tradition. Its historic proponents include Al-Kindi,Al-Kindi, On First Philosophy, with an Introduction and Commentary by Alfred L. Ivry (Albany, N. Y.: State University of New York Press, 1974), pp. 67‚Äì75 Al-Ghazali,al Ghazali, Kitab al lqtisad, with a foreword by √é. A. √áubuk√ßu and H. Atay (Ankara: University of Ankara Press, 1962), pp. 15‚Äì16. and St. Bonaventure.Francis J. Kovach, 'The Question of the Eternity of the World in St. Bonaventure and St. Thomas ‚Äì A Critical Analysis', Southwestern Journal of Philosophy 5 (1974), pp. 141‚Äì172.Smith, 2007: 183Craig, 2000 One of the earliest formulations of the cosmological argument in Islamic tradition comes from Al-Ghazali, who writes: :\\"Every being which begins has a cause for its beginning; now the world is a being which begins; therefore, it possesses a cause for its beginning.\\"Craig, 1994: 80 Between the 9th to 12th centuries, the cosmological argument developed as a concept within Islamic theology. It was refined in the 11th century by Al- Ghazali (The Incoherence of the Philosophers), and in the 12th by Ibn Rushd (Averroes).Averroes, Ibn Rushd, The Incoherence of the Incoherence (Tahafut al-Tahafut) London:Luzac, 1954, pp. 58 It reached medieval Christian philosophy in the 13th century and was discussed by Bonaventure, as well as Thomas Aquinas in his Summa Theologica (I, q.2, a.3) and Summa Contra Gentiles (I, 13). Islamic perspectives may be divided into positive Aristotelian responses strongly supporting the argument, such as those by Al-Kindi, and Averroes, and negative responses critical of it, including those by Al-Ghazali and Muhammad Iqbal.Iqbal, Muhammad The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam Lahore:Institute of Islamic Culture, 1986 Al-Ghazali was unconvinced by the first-cause arguments of Al-Kindi, arguing that only the infinite per se is impossible, arguing for the possibility of the infinite per accidens. He writes: :\\"According to the hypothesis under consideration, it has been established that all the beings in the world have a cause. Now, let the cause itself have a cause, and the cause of the cause have yet another cause, and so on ad infinitum. It does not behove you to say that an infinite regress of causes is impossible.\\"Al-Ghazzali, Tahafut Al-Falasifah (The Incoherence of Philosophers), translated by Sabih Ahmad Kamali. Lahore: Pakistan Philosophical Congress, 1963 pp. 90‚Äì91 Muhammad Iqbal also stated: :\\"A finite effect can give only a finite cause, or at most an infinite series of such causes. To finish the series at a certain point, and to elevate one member of the series to the dignity of an un-caused first cause, is to set at naught the very law of causation on which the whole argument proceeds.\\" Contemporary discourse According to the atheist philosopher Quentin Smith, \\"a count of the articles in the philosophy journals shows that more articles have been published about Craig‚Äôs defense of the Kalam argument than have been published about any other philosopher‚Äôs contemporary formulation of an argument for God‚Äôs existence.\\"Quentin Smith, \\"Kalam Cosmological Arguments for Atheism\\", in Michael Martin (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to Atheism, Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 183 The Kalam cosmological argument has received criticism from philosophers such as J. L. Mackie, Graham Oppy, Michael Martin, Quentin Smith, physicists Paul Davies, Lawrence Krauss and Victor Stenger, and authors such as Dan Barker.Reichenbach, 2004: 4.1 Modern discourse encompasses the fields of both philosophy and science (quantum physics and cosmology), which Bruce Reichenbach summarises as: :\\"... whether there needs to be a cause of the first natural existent, whether something like the universe can be finite and yet not have a beginning, and the nature of infinities and their connection with reality\\".Reichenbach, 2004: 5.6 =Premise one: \\"Whatever begins to exist has a cause.\\"= Craig defends the first premise as follows:Craig, 1994: 92Craig and Moreland, 2009: 182-190 #Rational intuition: He states that the first premise is self-evidently true, being based upon the Causal Principle that \\"something cannot come into being from nothing\\", or \\"Ex nihilo nihil fit\\", originating from Parmenidean philosophy. He affirms that this is a crucial first principle of science. #Reductio ad absurdum: If false, it would be inexplicable why anything and everything does not randomly appear into existence without a cause. #Inductive reasoning from both common experience and scientific evidence, which constantly verifies and never falsifies the truth of the first premise. According to Reichenbach, \\"the Causal Principle has been the subject of extended criticism\\", which can be divided into philosophical and scientific criticisms.Reichenbach, 2004: 5.1 Philosophical objections Graham Oppy, J. L. Mackie and Wes Morriston have objected to the intuitiveness of the first premise.Oppy G (2002). Arguing About The Kalam Cosmological Argument. Philo 5 (1):34-61Mackie, 1982: 94Morriston W (2002). Causes and Beginnings in the Kalam Argument. Faith and philosophy, 19(2). Oppy states: :\\"Mackie, [Adolf] Grunbaum, [Quentin] Smith and I‚Äîamong many others‚Äîhave taken issue with the first premise: why should it be supposed that absolutely everything which begins to exist has a cause for its beginning to exist?\\" Mackie affirms that there is no good reason to assume a priori that an uncaused beginning of all things is impossible. Moreover, that the Causal Principle cannot be extrapolated to the universe from inductive experience. He appeals to David Hume's thesis (An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding) that effects without causes can be conceived in the mind, and that what is conceivable in the mind is possible in the real world.Mackie, 1982: 85 This argument has been criticised by Bruce Reichenbach and G.E.M. Anscombe, who point out the phenomenological and logical problems in inferring factual possibility from conceivability.Reichenbach, 2004: 3.4G.E.M. Anscombe, '\\"Whatever has a beginning of existence must have a cause\\": Hume's argument exposed', Analysis XXXIV (1974), 150. Craig notes: :\\"Hume himself clearly believed in the causal principle. He presupposes throughout the Enquiry that events have causes, and in 1754 he wrote to John Stewart, 'But allow me to tell you that I never asserted so absurd a Proposition as that anything might arise without a cause'\\".Professor Mackie and the Kalam Cosmological Argument, William Lane CraigDavid Hume to John Stewart, February 1754, in The Letters of David Hume, 2 vols., ed. J. T. Grieg (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1932), 1, 187 Morriston asserts that causal laws are physical processes for which we have intuitive knowledge in the context of events within time and space, but that such intuitions do not hold true for the beginning of time itself. He states: :\\"We have no experience of the origin of worlds to tell us that worlds don't come into existence like that. We don't even have experience of the coming into being of anything remotely analogous to the ‚Äúinitial singularity‚Äù that figures in the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe.\\"Morriston W (2000). Must the Beginning of the Universe Have a Personal Cause? A Critical Examination of the Kalam Cosmological Argument. Faith and Philosophy, 17:149. In reply, Craig has maintained that causal laws are unrestricted metaphysical truths that are \\"not contingent upon the properties, causal powers, and dispositions of the natural kinds of substances which happen to exist\\", remarking: :\\"The history of twentieth century astrophysical cosmology belies Morriston's claim that people have no strong intuitions about the need of a causal explanation of the origin of time and the universe.\\"Must the Beginning of the Universe Have a Personal Cause?: A Rejoinder, William Lane Craig Quantum physics A common objection to premise one appeals to the phenomenon of quantum indeterminacy, where, at the subatomic level, the causal principle appears to break down. Craig replies that the phenomenon of indeterminism is specific to the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, pointing out that this is only one of a number of different interpretations, some of which he states are fully deterministic (mentioning David Bohm) and none of which are as yet known to be true. He concludes that subatomic physics is not a proven exception to the first premise.Moreland, James Porter, and William Lane. Craig. Philosophical foundations for a Christian worldview. Downers Grove, Ill: InterVarsity P. 469 Philosopher Quentin Smith has cited the example of virtual particles, which appear and disappear from observation, apparently at random, to assert the tenability of uncaused natural phenomena.Smith, Q (1988), \\"The Uncaused Beginning of the Universe,\\" Philosophy of Science 55:39-57. In his book A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather Than Nothing, cosmologist Lawrence Krauss has proposed how quantum mechanics can explain how space-time and matter can emerge from 'nothing' (referring to the quantum vacuum). Philosopher Michael Martin has also referred to quantum vacuum fluctuation models to support the idea of a universe with uncaused beginnings. He writes: :\\"Even if the universe has a beginning in time, in the light of recently proposed cosmological theories this beginning may be uncaused. Despite Craig's claim that theories postulating that the universe 'could pop into existence uncaused' are incapable of 'sincere affirmation,' such similar theories are in fact being taken seriously by scientists.\\"Martin, 1990: 106. Martin lists the following sources as examples: Edward P. Tryon, \\"Is the Universe a Vacuum Fluctuation?\\" Nature, 246, December 14, 1973, pp. 396‚Äì397; Edward P. Tryon, \\"What Made the World?

Philosopher of science David Albert has criticised the use of the term 'nothing' in describing the quantum vacuum. In a review of Krauss's book, he states: :\\"Relativistic-quantum-field-theoretical vacuum states‚Äîno less than giraffes or refrigerators or solar systems‚Äîare particular arrangements of elementary physical stuff. The true relativistic- quantum-field-theoretical equivalent to there not being any physical stuff at all isn‚Äôt this or that particular arrangement of the fields‚Äîwhat it is (obviously, and ineluctably, and on the contrary) is the simple absence of the fields.\\"On the Origin of Everything, David Albert, The New York Times, March 2012 Likewise, Craig has argued that the quantum vacuum, in containing quantifiable, measurable energy, cannot be described as 'nothing', therefore, that phenomena originating from the quantum vacuum cannot be described as 'uncaused'. On the topic of virtual particles, he writes: :\\"For virtual particles do not literally come into existence spontaneously out of nothing. Rather the energy locked up in a vacuum fluctuates spontaneously in such a way as to convert into evanescent particles that return almost immediately to the vacuum.\\"\\"The Caused Beginning of the Universe: a Response to Quentin Smith.\\" British Journal for the Philosophy of Science 44 (1993): 623-639. Cosmologist Alexander Vilenkin has stated that even \\"the absence of space, time and matter\\" cannot truly be defined as 'nothing' given that the laws of physics are still present, though it would be \\"as close to nothing as you can get\\".In the Beginning Was the Beginning, Tufts Now 2014 =Premise two: \\"The universe began to exist.\\"= Craig justifies premise two using both physical arguments with evidence from cosmology and physics, and metaphysical arguments for the impossibility of actual infinities in reality. Cosmology and physics For physical evidence, Craig appeals to: #Scientific confirmation against a past-infinite universe in the form of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.The Existence of God and the Beginning of the Universe, William Lane Craig #Scientific evidence that the universe began to exist a finite time ago at the Big Bang. #The Borde‚ÄìGuth‚ÄìVilenkin theorem,A.

Professor Alexander Vilenkin, one of the three authors of the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin theorem, writes: :\\"A remarkable thing about this theorem is its sweeping generality. We made no assumptions about the material content of the universe. We did not even assume that gravity is described by Einstein‚Äôs equations. So, if Einstein‚Äôs gravity requires some modification, our conclusion will still hold. The only assumption that we made was that the expansion rate of the universe never gets below some nonzero value, no matter how small.\\"Vilenkin, A. (2007) Many Worlds in One: The Search for Other Universes, p.175 Victor J. Stenger has referred to the Aguirre-Gratton modelAguirre A and Gratton S (2002). Steady-state eternal inflation; Phys. Rev. D 65, 083507 for eternal inflation as an exemplar by which others disagree with the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin theorem.Victor J. Stenger. God and the Folly of Faith: The Incompatibility of Science and Religion. Prometheus Books, 2012. In private correspondence with Stenger, Vilenkin remarked how the Aguirre-Gratton model attempts to evade a beginning by reversing the \\"arrow of time\\" at t = 0, but that: \\"This makes the moment t = 0 rather special. I would say no less special than a true beginning of the universe.\\" At the \\"State of the Universe\\" conference at Cambridge University in January 2012, Vilenkin discussed problems with various theories that would claim to avoid the need for a cosmological beginning, alleging the untenability of eternal inflation, cyclic and cosmic egg models, eventually concluding: \\"All the evidence we have says that the universe had a beginning.\\"Why Physicists Can't Avoid A Creation Event, New Scientist 2012 Actual infinities On the impossibility of actual infinities, Craig asserts:Craig, 1996 #The metaphysical impossibility of an actually infinite series of past events by citing David Hilbert's famous Hilbert's Hotel thought experiment and Laurence Sterne's story of Tristram Shandy. #The mathematical impossibility of forming an actual infinite by successive addition. Michael Martin disagrees with these assertions by Craig, saying: :\\"Craig's a priori arguments are unsound or show at most that actual infinities have odd properties. This latter fact is well known, however, and shows nothing about whether it is logically impossible to have actual infinities in the real world.\\"Martin, 1990: 104‚Äì105 Andrew Loke has argued against the metaphysical possibility of a beginningless universe as well as that of an actual infinite existing in the real world.Loke, 2017), 55-61, 67-68 Another criticism comes from Thomist philosopher Dr. Edward Feser who claims that past and future events are potential rather than actual, meaning that an infinite past could exist in a similar way to how an infinite number of potential halfway points exist between any two given points (as was discussed in one of Zeno's paradoxes). Traversing an Infinite An alternative way to argue against the past eternity of the universe is through the impossibility of traversing (counting/crossing/completing) infinity. The argument generally goes something like this: #If the past were infinitely long, an infinite amount of time would have had to pass before today. #An infinite amount of time can never truly pass (because infinite time would never run out). #Therefore, the universe cannot be infinitely old. #Therefore, the universe began to exist. This argument presupposes presentism or the A Theory of time. If A Theory is correct, all past moments would have to occur before the present, which would vindicate the first premise. The second premise follows also from A Theory along with the nature of infinity being endless. Therefore, it follows that the universe cannot be infinitely old and began to exist. =Conclusion: \\"The universe has a cause.\\"= Given that the Kalam cosmological argument is a deductive argument, if both premises are true, the truth of the conclusion follows necessarily. In a critique of Craig's book The Kalam Cosmological Argument, published in 1979, Michael Martin states:Martin, 1990: 103 :\\"It should be obvious that Craig's conclusion that a single personal agent created the universe is a non sequitur. At most, this Kalam argument shows that some personal agent or agents created the universe. Craig cannot validly conclude that a single agent is the creator. On the contrary, for all he shows, there may have been trillions of personal agents involved in the creation.\\" Martin also claims that Craig has not justified his claim of creation \\"ex nihilo\\", pointing out that the universe may have been created from pre-existing material in a timeless or eternal state. Moreover, that Craig takes his argument too far beyond what his premises allow in deducing that the creating agent is greater than the universe. For this, he cites the example of a parent \\"creating\\" a child who eventually becomes greater than he or she.Martin, 1990: 103‚Äì14 In the subsequent Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology, published in 2009, Craig discusses the properties of the cause of the universe, explaining how they follow by entailment from the initial syllogism of the Kalam cosmological argument:Craig and Moreland, 2009: 193‚Äì194 #A first state of the material world cannot have a material explanation and must originate ex nihilo in being without material cause, because no natural explanation can be causally prior to the very existence of the natural world (space-time and its contents). It follows necessarily that the cause is outside of space and time (timeless, spaceless), immaterial, and enormously powerful, in bringing the entirety of material reality into existence. #Even if positing a plurality of causes prior to the origin of the universe, the causal chain must terminate in a cause which is absolutely first and uncaused, otherwise an infinite regress of causes would arise. #Occam's Razor maintains that unicity of the First Cause should be assumed unless there are specific reasons to believe that there is more than one causeless cause. #Agent causation, volitional action, is the only ontological condition in which an effect can arise in the absence of prior determining conditions. Therefore, only personal, free agency can account for the origin of a first temporal effect from a changeless cause. #Abstract objects, the only other ontological category known to have the properties of being uncaused, spaceless, timeless and immaterial, do not sit in causal relationships, nor can they exercise volitional causal power. Craig concludes that the cause of the existence of the universe is an \\"uncaused, personal Creator ... who sans the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and enormously powerful\\"; remarking upon the theological implications of this union of properties. In addition to the above arguments, several points can be made which draw further conclusions about the nature of the cause. #The Principle of Proportional Causality (PPC), which states that whatever is present in the effect must be somehow present in the cause, would require the patterns and information of the universe to be present within the cause somehow. Since this information cannot exist in a material way (e.g., how a ball possesses a spherical pattern), it must exist in an immaterial way. But for information to exist in an immaterial way is what is classically defined as intellect (e.g. the mental concept of a sphere). Therefore, the cause must possess all information in the universe and is thus all-knowing. #If the PPC is not accepted, given that the cause of the universe must be a personal and free agent, the complexity and precision of the universe implies extreme intelligence. #In addition to Occam's Razor, it may be argued that the unicity and coherence of the universe implies a single agent behind the creation of the universe. =Theories of time= Craig maintains that the Kalam cosmological argument involves a commitment to the A-theory of time, also known as the \\"tensed theory of time\\" or presentism, as opposed to its alternative, the B-theory of time, also known as the \\"tenseless theory of time\\" or eternalism. The latter would allow the universe to exist tenselessly as a four-dimensional space-time block, under which circumstances the universe would not \\"begin to exist\\":Craig and Moreland, 2009: 183‚Äì184 :\\"From start to finish, the kalam cosmological argument is predicated upon the A-Theory of time. On a B-Theory of time, the universe does not in fact come into being or become actual at the Big Bang; it just exists tenselessly as a four-dimensional space-time block that is finitely extended in the earlier than direction. If time is tenseless, then the universe never really comes into being, and, therefore, the quest for a cause of its coming into being is misconceived.\\" Craig has defended the A-theory against objections from J. M. E. McTaggart and hybrid A‚ÄìB theorists. Philosopher Yuri Balashov has criticised Craig's attempt to reconcile the A-theory with special relativity by relying on a ‚Äòneo‚ÄêLorentzian interpretation‚Äô of Special Relativity. Balashov claims: :\\"Despite the fact that presentism has the firm backing of common sense and eternalism revolts against it, eternalism is widely regarded as almost the default view in contemporary debates, and presentism as a highly problematic view.\\" Craig has criticised Balashov for adopting a verificationist methodology that fails to address the metaphysical and theological foundations of the A-theory.Response to McCall and Balashov , William Lane Craig It has recently been argued that a defense of the Kalam cosmological argument does not have to involve such a commitment to the A-theory.Waters, 2015 See also *Arguments for the existence of God *Cosmogony *Natural theology *Principle of sufficient reason *Temporal finitism *Agent causation *Kalam References =Sources=      * * Further reading   Category:Arguments for the existence of God Category:Kalam Category:Philosophy of religion ","title":"Kalam cosmological argument"},{"id":"1148882","text":"Carlton The 2002 Australian Football League season was the 106th season of the elite Australian rules football competition and the 13th under the name 'Australian Football League', having switched from 'Victorian Football League' after 1989.

Notable events * For the first time since 1965, no player kicked ten goals or more in a match. * won the wooden spoon for the first time since 1894. Carlton was the last of the twelve traditional Victorian clubs to win the wooden spoon in the VFL/AFL. * played only four home games at Optus Oval, after arranging a deal to play four home games at Colonial Stadium. In order for the AFL to meet its contractual obligation to stage nine games per year at Optus Oval, six neutral games between a low-drawing Victorian team and an interstate team were staged at the venue. The unpopular venture was not repeated, as all of the home teams in these neutral games lost money due to poor crowds and, in many cases, conflicting sponsorship deals. *Even though Adelaide was entitled to a home Semi-Final after losing its Qualifying Final to Brisbane, the game was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground due to a licence agreement which required at least one game to be played at the ground during each week of the finals. * At the end of the season, the Carlton Football Club was found to have systematically breached the salary cap in 2000 and 2001. The club was fined and stripped of draft picks in the following two drafts, hampering their on-field results and long-term playing list rebuild in subsequent seasons. * Sydney coach Rodney Eade resigned following round 12, after the Swans slumped to 14th on the ladder.

It bordered Goguryeo and Okjeo to the north, Jinhan to the south, and China's Lelang Commandery to the west. Today, this territory consists of the provinces of South Hamgy≈èng and Kangwon in North Korea, and Gangwon in South Korea. History Proto‚ÄìThree Kingdoms, c. 001 AD. Ye appears in history as a vassal state of Goguryeo. In early 5th- century, however, King Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo annexed Ye, leading to Goguryeo's domination of the entire northern portion of the Korean peninsula and most of Manchuria. A small part of Ye in the south was absorbed into Silla. People and culture The Ye considered themself as the same people as of Goguryeo, and shared the language and ethnic origins with the people of Okjeo and Goguryeo. This may indicate that Dongye also shared a common origin with Buyeo and Gojoseon. The population was recorded to be 280,000 families. Very little information about Ye has survived; most of the extant information comes from the discussion of the Eastern barbarians in the Chinese Records of Three Kingdoms. The custom of \\"Mucheon\\" (Î¨¥Ï≤ú, ËàûÂ§©), a festival of worshipping heaven through song and dance in the 10th month, is mentioned in some records. This appears to have been closely related to the Goguryeo festival of Dongmaeng, held at the same time of year, which also incorporated martial displays. The people worshiped the tiger as a deity. The economy of Ye was based primarily on agriculture, including sericulture and hemp cultivation.Records of Three Kingdoms (San guo zhi): È∫ªÂ∏ÉÔºåË†∂Ê°ë‰ΩúÁ∂øÔºå ÊõâÂÄôÊòüÂÆøÔºåË±´Áü•Âπ¥Ê≠≤Ë±êÁ¥Ñ.

The ship ran aground in the Houtman Abrolhos, off the coastal regions of Western Australia in June 1629, which led to a bloody mutiny orchestrated by Jeronimus Cornelisz.  Background  Born in Antwerp, Pelsaert joined the Dutch East India Company and sailed to India in 1618, where he was posted as a junior merchant, spending seven years in Agra during which time he became a senior merchant. After a brief return to the United Provinces in 1628, he departed for Java soon after in command of the Batavia. Batavia Ongeluckige voyagie van het schip Batavia, uytgevaren onder't beleydt van den E. Fran√ßois Pelsaert, 1648 During the voyage from the Texel to Java, a company official, Jeronimus Cornelisz, and the ship's skipper Ariaen Jacobsz, had plotted but never attempted a mutiny against Pelsaert. Before this was possible, the ship had been wrecked. The wreck of the Batavia took place on Morning Reef, about to the south of what is now known as Beacon Island. Of the 341 passengers and crew, about 40 drowned early on while trying to reach a small island, while the rest succeeded in getting ashore. After a brief search of the island and several nearby islands, the commander realized that the islands held no natural water source, and eventually decided to head for Batavia to get help. He left with the ship's longboat and a party of 48 officers and passengers, including one babe in arms. All survived the voyage. After the departure of Pelsaert, Cornelisz finally succeeded with his mutiny by gathering a group of mutineers and assuming control of the social situation. Cornelisz and his men then began a reign of terror, murdering over 100 men, women, and children before they finally found resistance from a group of soldiers under the command of Wiebbe Hayes, who had been exiled to a neighbouring island. In October 1629, after a four-month absence, Pelsaert returned to the islands on the Dutch East India Company‚Äôs ship . Cornelisz had been captured weeks earlier by Hayes' men, and he and his mutineers were tried and most were executed. After several weeks spent trying to salvage the Batavia's goods, Pelsaert and the survivors returned to Java.  Later life  Pelsaert's health had suffered from the hardships, but nevertheless he took part in an expedition to Sumatra. He died in September 1630, soon after his return to Batavia. He does not seem to have taken his seat in the High Government at Batavia for which he had been selected as extraordinary member in 1629. Little of his life earnings were eventually passed to his elderly mother. He had no offspring, and no heirs for his fortune. In the end, the Dutch East India Company retained most of his earnings. Pelsaert had secretly acquired a large sum of unauthorized goods and money before his death. These were discovered by the Dutch East India Company, and confiscated.

The chain expanded successfully into New Zealand and unsuccessfully into several other countries. The company was founded in Sydney in 1968 by Dick Smith and owned by him and his wife until they sold 60% to Woolworths Limited in 1980, the remaining 40% two years later. The company closed in 2016, four years after its acquisition by Anchorage Capital Partners.  History  =Early years= The business started in 1968 in a small $15-rent-per-week premises in a car park in the Sydney suburb of Neutral Bay with a total capital of only AU$610 (equivalent to A$7500 in 2018). Initially, the business focused on installing and servicing car radios. In 1969, the business's success required it to move to bigger premises, first Atkinson Street, St Leonards, later Carlotta Street, Artarmon with flagship store nearby, on the Pacific Highway, Gore Hill. When the entire electronics business landscape was remodelled by the Whitlam government's across-the-board 25% tariff cut in 1973, for the loss of 138,000 manufacturing jobs, Smith moved with the market and met the competition with a re-emphasis on imported electronic components and finished products. Alongside the car radio business, he opened \\"Dick Smith Wholesale\\". The business catered to electronics hobbyists, meeting a need Smith had felt. In those days, hobbyists could buy components only from larger wholesale companies better set up for dealing with commercial customers. After touring overseas electronic stores to study modern merchandising methods, Smith introduced self-serve shopping, a breakaway from the longstanding counter-sales setup found in component sales at the time, and produced an annual mail-order catalogue with a substantial data section. =Publicity stunts= The company promoted itself with wacky-style and Smith's own publicity stunts. For example, Smith claimed that he would tow an iceberg from Antarctica to Sydney Harbour, cut it up into small bits and sell it for 10 cents a cube. On the morning of 1 April 1978, it appeared as if he had succeeded as hundreds of phone calls reporting the iceberg began flooding into local newspapers and radio and television stations, most of which were from Dick Smith employees. The \\"iceberg\\" turned out to be a barge cloaked in white plastic sheeting and topped with firefighting foam, an April Fool's joke. =Expansion= A Dick Smith Wizzard ‚Äì a combination computer/video game console that was rebranded and sold through the stores The company profited from the CB radio boom of the 1970s and by the end of the decade had stores in all mainland states. Though many CB radio stores closed when interest waned at the end of the 70s, Dick Smith Electronics thrived on exploding PC sales and its established electronic components and kit lines. To ensure almost every electronic enthusiast in Australia had one of his catalogues, it was included free in the popular electronics magazines Electronics Australia and Electronics Today International. The catalogues included ever-increasing amounts of data on electronic components, which helped make it an essential reference for anyone involved in electronics professionally or as a hobby. Private-branding (as \\"Dick Smith\\" or \\"DSE\\") was introduced on a large range of products from the late-70s. Many DSE-brand products were re-branded versions of the same or similar products sold in parallel by their manufacturers. Dick Smith Electronics own-brand System 80 computer, which was a clone of the Tandy TRS-80 Model I, led a highly successful line, including the Dick Smith Cat (an Apple II clone), the VZ-200 and VZ-300. The company also sold brand name personal computers such as the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore 64. In 1981, the Super-80 kit computer was developed as a joint venture between the company and Electronics Australia magazine. The company expanded its product range, especially during the 1970s and 1980s, and stocked items such as the Heathkit electronic kits, satellite TV receiving stations, Beeple pagers and the Dick Smith Wizzard computer game. The company was an early seller of telephone equipment including answering machines, cordless and novelty phones. = Woolworths takeover= In 1980, the company had grown to 20 stores and the founder and his wife sold 60% of the company's shares to large general retailer Woolworths Limited. The Smiths sold the balance of the company's capital to Woolworths in 1982, the total transfer price coming to A$25million. The company continued to add to its network of small \\"main street\\" stores in suburbs and regional cities across Australia.  Powerhouse  The logo used for Dick Smith Powerhouse stores before the branding was discontinued in 2009 The late 1990s saw the company establish \\"Dick Smith Powerhouse\\" super- stores across the east coast of Australia. The first Powerhouse store was opened in Bankstown, New South Wales in 1996. These were several times bigger than regular stores at approximately and contained departments for the main product categories and supermarket-style checkouts. The \\"Powerhouses\\", as they were known, carried a wider range of products than the smaller DSE stores, especially in the computing, audio-visual and amateur radio areas, and introduced Music to the range. Some installation services were also introduced as well as Computer repairs and upgrading. In 2002 and 2003, the Powerhouse concept changed to focus on a broader consumer market and less towards electronics enthusiasts. Component ranges shrank and general electronics books ceased to be stocked. The Yaesu amateur radio dealership was relinquished, ending a 27-year partnership. Electronic kits were transferred to the smaller DSE stores and were replaced by the short-lived appearance of small appliances such as kettles, coffee makers, toasters and frypans. A home installation service known as \\"PowerSquad\\" to install major items such as TVs and computer systems or to provide set-up and training on smaller items such as wireless networking and MP3 players was offered. In late 2007, Powerhouse stores also transferred many other small components, tools, leads and connectors to small stores, continuing to distance the super-stores from the company's electronic enthusiast roots.  Major changes  Hornsby DSE, housed inside Westfield Hornsby, was the first store to be renovated under the new concept In early 2008, following Woolworths' review of its consumer electronics division, Dick Smith Electronics renovated its flagship store in Hornsby, New South Wales, as a \\"concept\\" under the branding \\"Dick Smith Technology\\". The store's design and product range was completely reworked incorporating a more modern feel while removing all electrical componentry and much of its tools. These products were replaced with a larger range of Windows computers, gaming, televisions and Macintosh computers, much of which had previously been only sold in Powerhouse stores.Inside the first Dick Smith concept store Hornsby DSE following its rebranding as Dick Smith Technology Following further strategic review, the company decided to push forward with the new concept under the reworked \\"Dick Smith ‚Äì Talk to the Techxperts\\" branding, merging all existing Dick Smith Electronics and Powerhouse stores under the same banner. In late 2008 the new Dick Smith logo and format was rolled out with many Powerhouse stores such as Macquarie Centre and Auburn being rebranded to fit the new unified company logo. Newly branded Dick Smith outlet in the Sturt Mall, Wagga Wagga \\"Large Format Stores\\" opened in Chadstone Shopping Centre and Bendigo in Victoria, Marion, South Australia, Perth central business district, Innaloo and Rockingham in Western Australia, Hobart in Tasmania, and Stockland Rockhampton in Queensland, under new \\"Dick Smith ‚Äì Talk to the Techxperts\\" branding. In March 2009, Woolworths Limited CEO Michael Luscombe confirmed the end of Powerhouse as a separate entity, also adding that the company's third consumer electronics brand Tandy would be gradually phased out over the next three years as the stores' leases ended. This phase left \\"Dick Smith\\" as the sole brand in the parent company's consumer electronics division. The mail-order catalogue so central to the company's success from the early days was last published in 2009, giving way to the online sales platform. =Acquisition by Anchorage Capital= On 31 January 2012, after nearly 30 years of ownership, Woolworths announced that after the results of a strategic review and a $300 million restructuring, it would close up to 100 Dick Smith stores and sell the business. The company was sold to Australian investment firm Anchorage Capital Partners in September 2012, for an initial cash payment of A$20 millionWoolworths sells Dick Smith chain to buyout firm for $A20m - National Business Review. 27 September 2012Dick Smith‚Äôs $400m fall: how a retail icon stumbled - Crikey.com.au, 28 September 2012 and ultimate total price of some $115 million. It has been argued that Anchorage only put up $10 million in cash, the remainder of the funds being sourced from the business itself through liquidation of inventory, plant and equipment, and taking provision for future onerous lease payments, a process described as \\"the greatest private equity heist of all time\\". In November 2012, Nick Abboud was appointed CEO. In December 2013, Dick Smith was floated by Anchorage on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), becoming a public company. At the time of the listing, the market capitalisation of the company was valued at A$520 million, less than two years after Anchorage had purchased the company for A$20 million.The agony and the agony: Dick Smith's journey from private equity plaything to IPO - National Business Review, 5 January 2016Fickling, David (5 January 2016) Who Killed Dick Smith? - Bloomberg, Retrieved 5 January 2016 Anchorage initially retained 20% of the shares in the new company but had fully divested their holdings by September 2014.Investments-Dick Smith Holdings Limited - Anchorage Capital, retrieved 5 January 2016 Alliance with David Jones From 1 October 2013, Dick Smith took over the operation of the home entertainment department in 30 David Jones retail stores in Australia and online.

Having failed to secure a buyer for the stores, receivers Ferrier Hodgson announced, on 25 February 2016, that all 363 DSE stores in Australia and New Zealand would be closed, with the loss of 2,460 jobs. On 15 March 2016 it was revealed that Kogan.com, the online retailer founded by Ruslan Kogan, had acquired the Dick Smith brand, trademarks, intellectual property, and its online business in Australia and New Zealand for an undisclosed price. The Dick Smith brand has been transitioned to an online-only store selling a wide variety of consumer items. The last physical retail stores closed on 3 May 2016. On 25 July 2016 Dick Smith Electronics' creditors placed what was then left of the company in liquidation. Creditors were expected to lose up to A$260 million. Though not connected with the company for 34 years, its founder Dick Smith expressed dismay at the closure and put it down to the \\"utter greed of modern capitalism\\".  Outside Australia  = Hong Kong = DSE's first foray offshore was the establishment Dick Smith Electronics (HK) Limited in Hong Kong in 1978. It operated a small buying office and one retail store, at two locations in Ashley Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong. The store targeted tourists generally and Australians, in particular, looking for tax-free DSE products. An international edition of the flagship catalogue was published in support of the operation. In the face of fierce competition from established local retailers and disappointing sales, the business closed in June 1980. = New Zealand = Dick Smith Electronics registered for business in New Zealand in 1981 and is believed to have opened a store the same year. In 1992, the company acquired and rebranded the retail business of David Reid Electronics, a similar chain that at one time consisted of about 30 stores. In some cases, this meant that for a time two Dick Smith stores operated in the same suburb. In New Zealand, Dick Smith Electronics had over 75 locations. They included the \\"Powerhouse\\" stores, the first of which opened in Hamilton, followed by Manukau and Sylvia Park in Auckland, and Palmerston North. A third brand \\"Dick Smith Technology\\" store opened in Lower Hutt, following the same Powerhouse product range. Its e-commerce website had been using a search engine by SLI Systems that learns from what the users search for. The PowerHouse brand was discontinued in 2009. = United States = From 1980, DSE operated a small number of stores in the United States, in Northern California and Los Angeles, but had closed by the end of the decade. Sponsorships DSE sponsored the Melbourne Stars in the T20 Big Bash League cricket, a number of tennis tournaments including the Hopman Cup (Western Australia), the World Tennis Challenge (South Australia), the Brisbane International (Queensland) and the Apia International (Sydney). The company was a sponsor of the National Rugby League nine-a-side tournament, the Auckland Nines and of the AFL club Richmond from 2008 until the end of 2011.

The term Schicksalstag (German: Day of Fate) has been occasionally used by historians and journalists since shortly after World War II, but its current widespread use started with the events of 1989 when virtually all German media picked up the term. Events There are six notable events in German history that are connected to 9 November: the execution of Robert Blum in 1848, the end of the monarchies in 1918, the naming of Albert Einstein as the winner of the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics, Hitler putsch attempt in 1923, the Nazi antisemitic pogroms in 1938 and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. * 1848: After being arrested in the Vienna revolts, left liberal leader Robert Blum was executed. The execution can be seen as a symbolic event or forecast of the ultimate crushing of the German March Revolution in April and May 1849. * 1918: Emperor Wilhelm II was dethroned in the November Revolution by his chancellor Max von Baden, who published the news of an abdication before the emperor had abdicated. Philipp Scheidemann proclaimed the German republic from a window of the Reichstag. Two hours later, Karl Liebknecht proclaimed a \\"Free Socialist Republic\\" from a balcony of the Berliner Stadtschloss. Der 9. November (The Ninth of November) is the title of a novel by Bernhard Kellermann published in Germany that told the story of the German insurrection of 1918. It was Scheidemann's intention to proclaim the republic before the communists did. * 1922: Albert Einstein was one of the most well-known and influential physicists of the 20th century. On 9 November 1922, he was named the winner of the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \\"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\\". * 1923: The failed Beer Hall Putsch, from 8 to 9 November, marks an early emergence and provisional downfall of the Nazi Party as an important player on Germany's political landscape. Without sufficient preparation Hitler simply declared himself leader in Munich, Bavaria. Hitler's march through Munich was stopped by Bavarian police who opened fire. Sixteen nationalists and four policemen were killed. Only after 1930 would Hitler gain significant voter support, a process that would culminate in the Nazis' electoral victory of 1933. During the Nazi rule 9 November was a national holiday in Germany in memory of the Nazis who died in the beer hall Putsch. *1923: Wilhelm, German Crown Prince, chose 9 November 1923 for his return to Germany from exile in the Netherlands, which infuriated his father, the former emperor, who felt the anniversary of his abdication was ill-chosen.Heike M√ºller, Harald Berndt, Schloss Cecilienhof und die Konferenz von Potsdam 1945 (Stiftung Preussische Schl√∂sser und G√§rten, 2006, ), pp 11‚Äì12 * 1938: In what is today known in Germany as the Reichspogromnacht (Kristallnacht), from 9 to 10 November, synagogues and Jewish property were burned and destroyed on a large scale, and more than four hundred Jews were killed or driven to suicide. The event demonstrated that the antisemitic stance of the Nazi regime was not so 'moderate' as it had appeared partially in earlier years. After 10 November, about 30,000 Jews were arrested; many of them later died in concentration camps. * 1989: The fall of the Berlin Wall ended German separation and started a series of events that ultimately led to German reunification. 9 November was considered for the date for German Unity Day, but as it was also the anniversary of Kristallnacht, this date was considered inappropriate as a national holiday. The date of the formal reunification of Germany, 3 October 1990, therefore, was chosen as the date for this German national holiday instead, to replace 17 June, the celebration of the uprising of 1953 in East Germany.Kosmidou, Eleftheria Rania (2012). European Civil War Films: Memory, Conflict, and Nostalgia. pp. 9‚Äì10. East Germany opened checkpoints on this day which allowed people to go into West Germany.

In the Roman period and perhaps earlier, the toponym referred to a portion of the Southeast Africa coast extending from Kenya,Richard Pankhurst, An Introduction to the Economic History of Ethiopia, (Lalibela House: 1961), p.21 to perhaps as far south as Tanzania. This area was inhabited by Southern Cushitic-speaking populations until the wave of Bantu expansion.https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/ElAnt/V1N5/hilton.html Ancient Azania Pliny the Elder mentions an \\"Azanian Sea\\" (N.H. 6.34) that began around the emporium of Adulis and stretched around the south coast of Africa. The 1st century AD Greek travelogue the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea first describes Azania based on its author's intimate knowledge of the area. Chapter 15 of the Periplus suggests that Azania could be the littoral area south of present-day Somalia (the \\"Lesser and Greater Bluffs\\", the \\"Lesser and Greater Strands\\", and the \\"Seven Courses\\").George Wynn Brereton Huntingford, The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, (Hakluyt Society: 1980), p.29 Chapter sixteen describes the emporium of Rhapta, located south of the Puralean Islands at the end of the Seven Courses of Azania, as the \\"southernmost market of Azania\\". The Periplus does not mention any dark-skinned \\"Ethiopians\\" among the area's inhabitants. They only later appear in Ptolemy's Geographia, but in a region far south, around the \\"Bantu nucleus\\" of northern Mozambique. According to John Donnelly Fage, these early Greek documents altogether suggest that the original inhabitants of the Azania coast, the \\"Azanians\\", were of the same ancestral stock as the Afro-Asiatic populations to the north of them along the Red Sea. Subsequently, by the 10th century AD, these original \\"Azanians\\" had been replaced by early waves of Bantu settlers. Later Western writers who mention Azania include Claudius Ptolemy (c. 100 ‚Äì c. 170 CE) and Cosmas Indicopleustes (6th century CE). Azania was known to the Chinese as Êæ§Êï£ (Middle Chinese: , Pinyin: z√©s√†n) by the 3rd century AD. Revival The term was briefly revived in the second half of the 20th century as the appellation given to South Africa by African nationalists such as the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) party. It was also considered as a possible name for South Sudan when it voted for independence in 2011, and has been applied to Jubaland within Somalia. Zanj Coast Mofarite, Hadramite and Omani merchants established various trading posts on the Zanj Coast corresponding to Azania, the South Semitic etymology of A'Zania preceded the later Arabic Al-Zanjia.

They are a monophyletic and monogeneric family of trees with currently 7 confirmed species. They were formerly placed within Scrophulariaceae sensu lato, or as a segregate of the Bignoniaceae. The Paulowniaceae are now resolved as a distinct separate family consisting of the genus Paulownia. They are deciduous trees with large heart shaped leaves and long panicles of white-purple to lavender flowers native to eastern Asia. The most widely distributed and recognized species is Paulownia tomentosa with common names such as Princess tree, Empress tree, Kiri tree, Foxglove tree, and Phoenix tree.  Taxonomy  There are 7 confirmed species of Paulownia with potentially more as hybrid, variety, or mismatched synonym species. * Paulownia fargesii * Paulownia fortunei * Paulownia x taiwaniana * Paulownia catalpafolia * Paulownia elongata * Paulownia tomentosa * Paulownia coreana (Paulownia tomentosa var. coreana) * Paulownia kawakamii  Phylogeny  Paulowniaceae is sister to the Orobanchaceae, a primarily hemi-holoparasitic plant family, except for the clade of herbaceous genera Lindenbergia, Rehmannia, and Triaenophora. This clade of non-parasitic plants within Orobanchaceae are most closely related to Paulownia. Sister to the Orobanchaceae-Paulowniaceae clade is Phrymaceae. Phrymaceae are mostly herbaceous plants with a widespread distribution. , The Plant List accepted four genera in the family. However of these four genera currently only Paulownia is a recognized member of Paulowniaceae. * Paulownia * Brandisia is settled in the Orobanchaceae as sister to the Pterygiella due to molecular data from 9 chloroplast markers and samples from 6 of the 11 Brandisia species. They are a mostly shrublike family with hemi-parasitic characters that sometimes grow like climbing vines. Morphological similarities between Bradisia and Pterygiella, such as eglandular hairs on their capsules, reticulate seeds, and similar shaped tricolpate pollen, confirm their close relationship. * Wightia is now tentatively positioned as a sister group to Phrymaceae due to many morphological similarities as well as support by chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA analysis. They are a small genus of two species in Southeast Asia, that can grow as a shrub or tree, or as hemiepiphetic pseudo-vine. There are still morphological characters as well as nuclear genome data to support Wightia as sister to Paulownia leading it to be of proposed hybrid origin from Phrymaceae and Paulowniaceae. This theory, based on chloroplast genome evidence, would explain its morphological similarities to both families. However the conflicts between the chloroplast, mitochondrial, and nuclear phylogenetic data make it unclear. If these were tested further and proven to be correct it should place Wightia as a new family Wightiaceae. Though according to Liu et al, 2019, Wightia should already be its own distinct family as it is highly unlikely that any new study would provide more questionable data against this theory. * Shiuyinghua is an accepted genus on The Plant List and is listed under Paulowniaceae, but there is no updated published work on the phylogeny of the genus or its species Shiuyinghua silvestrii. Shiuyinghua has a history of being placed under the name Catalpa silvestrii in Bignoniaceae due to its leaf shape, but then as Paulownia silvestrii in the clade Paulownieae in Scrophulariaceae due to similarities in lateral and terminal inflorescences, and in the five-lobed calyx structure. In 1959 S. silvestrii was believed to be a distinct species within the Paulownieae tribe due to the overall flower bud shape being significantly different from all other members of Paulownia. The genus was named after Dr. Shiu-ying Hu of Harvard University‚Äôs Arnold Arboretum. Since then there has been no more evidence or discussion on its placement, nor any available molecular data on a species under the name Shiuyinghua silvestrii or Paulownia silvestrii.

Hadrian's Wall passed through the village, its course traced by the village's main road, Hexham Road. Throckley was a colliery village, being adjacent to Throckley Colliery; although with the decline in the coal-mining industry the village is becoming urbanised, like many of its kind. One of Throckley's more notable residents was William Brown, who was a consulting engineer in the 18th century, and part owner of Throckley Colliery at the time, responsible for the construction of many colliery waggonways throughout the North East of England. As a youngster, George Stephenson worked on Dewley farm which lies to the north of the A69. Throckley has neighbouring villages like Newburn, Walbottle, Blucher, and across the border in Northumberland, Heddon-on-the-Wall. The village is expanding with many new housing estates popping up since the mid 2000's Westway Industrial Park Throckley also offers a supermarket, car shop, a range of hair salons, social clubs, three care homes for the elderly, two churches, a solarium, funeral parlour, working men's club, an optometrist, medical surgery, a range of newsagents, a chemist, a Masonic hall, and one school (Throckley Primary School). Throckley's economy is also boosted by the presence of an industrial estate which is home to Throckley Brickworks and Warmseal Windows, two of its many businesses. Sightseeing and scenery Throckley itself, especially the Bank Top area, offers some views over the Tyne Valley, and looking west, to the distant Pennines. The Guardian featured Throckley in the top fifty walks guide for 2007. Throckley Dene is a stretch of semi-natural ancient woodland in a steep-sided valley with Dewley Burn running through.

Brownell at Yale University, in reference to the cyclical loss and gain of weight, resembling the up-down motion of a yo-yo. In this process, the dieter is initially successful in the pursuit of weight loss but is unsuccessful in maintaining the loss long-term and begins to gain the weight back. The dieter then seeks to lose the regained weight, and the cycle begins again. Causes The reasons for yo-yo dieting are varied but often include embarking upon a hypocaloric diet that was initially too extreme. At first the dieter may experience elation at the thought of weight loss and pride in their rejection of food. Over time, however, the limits imposed by such extreme diets cause effects such as depression or fatigue that make the diet impossible to sustain. Ultimately, the dieter reverts to their old eating habits, now with the added emotional effects of failing to lose weight by restrictive diet. Such an emotional state leads many people to eating more than they would have before dieting, causing them to rapidly regain weight. The process of regaining weight and especially body fat is further promoted by the high metabolic plasticity of skeletal muscle. The Summermatter cycle explains how skeletal muscle persistently reduces energy expenditure during dieting. In addition, food restriction increases physical activity which further supports body weight loss initially. Such weight regain in the form of preferential catch-up-fat is well documented after weight loss due to malnutrition, cancer, septic shock or AIDS and thus constitutes a general phenomenon related to weight loss. Effects on health This kind of diet is associated with extreme food deprivation as a substitute for good diet and exercise techniques. As a result, the dieter may experience loss of both muscle and body fat during the initial weight-loss phase (weight-bearing exercise is required to maintain muscle). After completing the diet, the dieter is likely to experience the body's starvation response, leading to rapid weight gain of only fat. This is a cycle that changes the body's fat-to- muscle ratio, one of the more important factors in health. A report by the American Psychological Association reviewed thirty-one diet studies and found that after two years of dieting up to a third of dieters weighed more than they did before they began the diet, another third regained the weight they lost, and the last third kept the loss weight off One study in rats showed those made to yo-yo diet were more efficient at gaining weight. However the research compiled by Atkinson et al. (1994) showed that there are ‚Äúno adverse effects of weight cycling on body composition, resting metabolic rate, body fat distribution, or future successful weight loss‚Äù, and that there is not enough evidence to show risk factors for cardiovascular disease being directly dependent on cyclical dieting patterns. A more recent review concluded \\"...evidence for an adverse effect of weight cycling appears sparse, if it exists at all\\". Since there is \\"no single definition of weight cycling [that] can be endorsed\\", it is almost impossible for research to draw specific conclusions about the actual effects of cyclical dieting, until it becomes more definitely defined.

Wight began competing in hillclimbs at an early age, but in September 1992, still only 21, he was badly injured in a road accident when the brakes failed on his Hillman Imp. It was feared that he might be paralysed, and he remained in hospital for more than two months, but by 1993 he was not only out of hospital, but competing in ‚Äì and winning his class in ‚Äì hillclimbs once again. In 1995, Graeme married. Two years later, after a time in a Vision sports car, Wight won the Scottish Hillclimb Championship outright driving a Pilbeam. 1998 saw his first year of competition in the British Championship, at first in the two-litre class but then in the unlimited-capacity division. In 2000, now driving a Gould, he broke the hill record at Doune by 1.49 seconds, an astonishing margin in hillclimbing and indeed the biggest improvement in an outright record in BHCC history. After finishing fourth in the Championship that year, he finally reached the top in 2001 and 2002, winning the title in both years. Graeme became the first driver to complete the course at Shelsley Walsh in under 25 seconds when he recorded a time of 24.85 seconds on Sunday 2 June 2002, in the presence of Sir Stirling Moss. In that same year, he became the first reigning British Hill Climb Champion to be invited to drive at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. He was runner-up to Adam Fleetwood in 2003, but after that things started to go wrong for Graeme. He was Fleetwood's main rival in the first part of the 2004 season, but delays in the appearance of his new car meant that he barely competed after mid-June and could manage only eighth place in the championship. Continued development problems in 2005 meant that he was never in the running in that season's championship and only rarely qualified for the run-offs. He was also absent from the 2006 championship, but still hopes to return to competition. This new car, christened the \\"GWR Predator\\" and of an entirely new bespoke design, is the product of a huge amount of effort. The concept of the car was to employ an ex-Arrows F1 Cosworth V10 as the powerplant, using the engine's inherent light-weight and power to allow even further increases of power-to-weight ratio. In October 2006, however, Wight announced that the V10 engine was to be sold as he had grown frustrated of being unable to compete due to continual engine problems. He decided instead to power the car with the ex-DTM 2.5 V6 Opel Cosworth, previously used in his Gould GR51, though in the event the V10 was used in 2007 after all. The Predator represents a huge leap the level of technology employed at what is ostensibly an amateur sport, with its combination of its ultra light weight, innovation and all-round complexity. Wight had a frustrating 2007, but late in 2008 the Predator finally came on song, and at the final round of the season, at Doune, he won the first run-off and came second in the other. Wight was thrilled with his victory, saying that \\"the car has never been that good before\\" and that it had been \\"amazing\\" through the Esses.\\"Predator closes in for the kill\\", Autosport 2 October 2008, p97. His father, also named Graeme Wight and sometimes known as Graeme Wight Sr. to distinguish him from his son, also competed in hillclimbs, often sharing a car with his son. For 2009, Wight stated his intention to compete with an electrically powered machine, designed in partnership with ex- Lotus F1 designer Martin Ogilvie and Cambridge University. The car is part of the Bee 4 Motorsport project. This project did not last long enough for the car to be built. Wight's main business now is building the GWR Raptor single- seatershttps://www.topgear.com/car-news/video/maddest-hillclimb-you-will-see- today (also designed by Ogilvie) which have won many individual events though not yet the British Championship. All Raptors so far have been powered by supercharged or naturally-aspirated Suzuki Hayabusa engines with the exception of Midland Champion Robert Kenrick's BMW S1000RR-engined car, which has broken many records in the 601-1100cc classhttps://www.shelsleywalsh.com/single- post/2018/05/08/Sun-Shines-for-first-Competitive-Weekend-of-the-Year. Wight competes only occasionally nowadays, but in June 2018 he set the fastest ever time for a 1600cc car (36.01 seconds) at Doune in Les Mutch's Raptorhttp://britishhillclimb.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BHC-Run-Off- Results-round-13-Doune.pdf.

Games * Tales of the Unknown, Volume I: The Bard's Tale (1985): In the series' eponymous first game, the evil wizard Mangar has cast a spell of eternal winter on the small country town of Skara Brae to isolate it, and the group must find and defeat him to free the town. * The Bard's Tale II: The Destiny Knight (1986; original projected title: The Archmage's Tale): To save the realm, the group must find the seven pieces of the Destiny Wand, reforge it (so that an Archmage from the group can become the legendary Destiny Knight), and confront the evil Archmage Lagoth Zanta. * The Bard's Tale III: Thief of Fate (1988; original projected title: The Thief's Tale): The mad god Tarjan, Mangar's master, has returned to Skara Brae and destroyed the city, though as it turns out this was only a small facet of his revenge. In their attempt to stop Tarjan, the group becomes embroiled in a war among gods across several dimensions. * The Bard's Tale Construction Set (1991), a game creation system that allows for the creation of dungeon crawl video games based on the Bard's Tale game engine * The Bard's Tale (2004): Action role-playing video game created by Brian Fargo, and published by Fargo's InXile Entertainment; not a proper part of the original series. Brian Fargo only had the rights to the name but not to the content/stories of the earlier games in the Bard's Tale series at that point. *The Mage's Tale (2017): A side-story game set in the Bard's Tale universe, developed by inXile alongside The Bard's Tale IV and released in 2017. Like other games in the series, it is a first-person dungeon crawler, but is built for virtual reality, featuring action-based spellcasting, rather than turn- based combat. *The Bard's Tale IV: Barrows Deep (2018): A proper fourth part of the original series was successfully funded as a Kickstarter project in 2015 by InXile Entertainment, and released in 2018. While continuing the story from the original trilogy, the actual gameplay was altered significantly and is arguably more similar to the 2004 game than to the first three games. *The Bard's Tale Remastered Trilogy (2018): A re-creation of the original trilogy for modern computers, with updated graphics and user interface, bugfixes, and other improvements. Books =Cluebooks= Official Cluebooks were published by Electronic Arts for the first three Bard's Tale games that expanded on the games' stories and added new characters: The Cluebook for the first game (1986, ) was written by T.L. Thompson as an in-universe document, the journal of a lord who had very nearly succeeded in solving the quest before finding that his party had lost crucial items. The party was implicitly wiped out just short of defeating Mangar but had seen to it that the journal would reach friendly hands. The Cluebook for the second game (1987) was written by T.L. Thompson and David K. Similarly as a short story, narrating how a party of adventurers asks a wizard to foretell their (possible) future by means of a divination spell, if they should attempt the game's quest to find the Destiny Wand and defeat Lagoth Zanta. The resulting trance vision of the possible future reflects poorly on the character of the group's leader, who is also shown to get assassinated at the end, and it is implied that the group will thus not embark on the quest after all even though they technically succeeded in the vision. The Cluebook for the third game (1988, ) was written by David Luoto in the style of a novella.

They include: #Castle of Deception, by Mercedes Lackey and Josepha Sherman (1992, ) #Fortress of Frost and Fire, by Mercedes Lackey and Ru Emerson (1993, ) #Prison of Souls, by Mercedes Lackey and Mark Shepherd (1994, ) #The Chaos Gate, by Josepha Sherman (1994, ) #Thunder of the Captains, by Holly Lisle and Aaron Allston (1996, ) #Wrath of the Princes, by Holly Lisle and Aaron Allston (1997, ) #Escape from Roksamur, by Mark Shepherd (1997, ) #Curse of the Black Heron, by Holly Lisle (1998, ) While they are listed here in the order they were published, some books in the series connect more than others, such as Castle of Deception and The Chaos Gate, Prison of Souls and Escape from Roksamur, and Thunder of the Captains and Wrath of the Princes. As part of the crowdfunding campaign for The Bard's Tale IV, six novels set in the Bard's Tale universe were provided to backers in EPUB format in 2018. Three of them are novelized re-tellings of the first three games' storylines (different from the cluebooks, and with different characters) by Nathan Long, who wrote the storyline for part IV; these three novels frame the original trilogy within the larger story and redefined setting from The Bard's Tale IV and the Remastered edition of the original trilogy. #The Bard's Tale, by Nathan Long #The Destiny Knight, by Nathan Long #The Thief of Fate, by Nathan Long #Paladin, by Elizabeth Watasin #Promises made by Moonlight, by Mike Lee #The Song Thief, by Jason Denzel (features a magic-wielding trow by the name of Soriac, apparently unrelated to the Archmage of the same name from the original cluebook for the first game) Reception In 1996, Next Generation listed the series (referring to the first three parts of the original trilogy plus the construction set at the time) collectively as number 62 on their \\"Top 100 Games of All Time\\", praising the all-in-one interface using multiple display windows and the unparalleled level of plot detail and development.

(1962). Studies in Shinto and Shrines. pp. 429-453. The shrine is familiarly known as Atsuta-Sama (Venerable Atsuta) or simply as Miya (the Shrine). Since ancient times, it has been especially revered, ranking with the Grand Shrine of Ise.Atsuta-jing≈´ org: \\"Introduction.\\" The shrine complex draws over 9 million visitors annually. History The Kojiki explains that Atsuta Shrine was founded to house the Kusanagi no Tsurugi, a legendary sword. According to traditional sources, Yamato Takeru died in the 43rd year of Emperor Keiko's reign (ÊôØË°åÂ§©Áöá43Âπ¥, equivalent 113 AD).Ponsonby-Fane, p. 433. The possessions of the dead prince were gathered together along with the sword Kusanagi; and his widow venerated his memory in a shrine at her home. Sometime later, these relics and the sacred sword were moved to the current location of the Atsuta Shrine.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 434. Nihonshoki explains that this move occurred in the 51st year of Keiko's reign, but shrine tradition also dates this event in the 1st year of Emperor Ch≈´ai's reign.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 435. During the Northern and Southern Courts Period, because it was believed that the Kusanagi no Tsurugi was or had once been housed there, the Atsuta Shrine proved to be a significant site in the struggle between ousted Emperor Go-Daigo (Southern Court) and the new emperor, Takauji Ashikaga (Northern Court). Go-Daigo was a patron to Atsuta Masayoshi, the shrine's attendant, who subsequently fled with him to Mt. Hiei in 1336 and went on to command troops on Go-Daigo's behalf in 1337. In 1335, after rebelling against Go-Daigo, Takauji appointed a new shrine attendant. He later prayed there while advancing on the capital, mimicking the behavior of Minamoto Yoritomo, who had done the same before founding the Kamakura shogunate. In 1338, the Southern Court had one more chance to occupy the shrine when Kitabatake Akiie led a large army down from the Southern Court's base on Mount Ry≈çzen. In the first month of 1338, Akiie also prayed at the shrine. However, he was killed in battle soon after and the Ashikaga cemented their control over Atsuta Shrine. From 1872 through 1946, Atsuta Shrine was officially designated one of the , meaning that it stood in the first rank of government supported shrines.Encyclopedia of Shinto: Atsuta Shink≈ç Hiroshige =Architecture= The shrine's buildings were maintained by donations from a number of benefactors, including well-known Sengoku period figures like Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and the Tokugawas. For example, the Nobunaga-Bei, a 7.4 m high roofed mud wall, was donated to the shrine in 1560 by Nobunaga as a token of gratitude for his victory at the Battle of Okehazama.Atsuta-jing≈´ org: \\"Precinct\\" (map). In 1893, it was remodeled using the Shinmeizukuri architectural style, the same style used in the building of Ise Shrine. Before a celebration in 1935, the shrine's buildings as well as other facilities were completely rearranged and improved in order to better reflect the history and cultural significance of the shrine. During the bombings of World War II, however, many of Atsuta Shrine's buildings were destroyed by fire. The shrine's main buildings, such as the honden, were reconstructed and completed in 1955. Following the completion of these buildings, construction of other buildings continued on the shrine grounds. In 1966 the Treasure Hall was completed in order to house the shrine's collection of objects, manuscripts and documents. Shinto belief The shrine's treasure hall Bunkaden This Shinto shrine is dedicated to the veneration of Atsuta-no- ≈åkami. Also enshrined are the \\"Five Great Gods of Atsuta\\", all of whom are connected with the legendary narratives of the sacred sword ‚Äî Amaterasu- ≈åmikami, Takehaya Susanoo-no-mikoto, Yamato Takeru-no-mikoto, Miyasu-hime no- mikoto, and Take Inadane-no-mikoto.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 429. Atsuta is the traditional repository of Kusanagi no Tsurugi, the ancient sword that is considered one of the Three Sacred Treasures of Japan.JapanGuide.com: Atsuta Shrine Central to the Shinto significance of Atsuta Shrine is the sacred sword which is understood to be a gift from Amaterasu ≈åmikami. This unique object has represented the authority and stature of Japan's emperors since time immemorial. Kusanagi is imbued with Amaterasu's spirit.Ponsonby-Fane, pp. 438-439. During the reign of Emperor Sujin, duplicate copies of the Imperial regalia were made in order to safeguard the originals from theft.Ponsonby- Fane, pp. 430-431. This fear of theft proved to be justified during the reign of Emperor Tenji when the sacred sword was stolen from Atsuta; and it was not to be returned until the reign of Emperor Tenmu. Although not seen by the general public since that time, it is said to have remained in safekeeping at the shrine up to the present day. Treasures The shrine's Bunkaden, or treasure hall, houses over 4,000 relics, which include 174 Important Cultural Properties and a dagger that is a designated National Treasure of Japan. Atsuta Jingu Museum preserves and displays a variety of historic material, including the koshinp≈ç (sacred garments, furniture and utensils for use of the enshrined deities). A number of donated swords, mirrors and other objects are held by the shrine, including Bugaku masks and other material associated with ancient court dances. The Bunkaden collection ranges from ancient documents to household articles. Aichi Prefecture has designated 174 items as important cultural assets.Atsuta-jing≈´ org: \\"Treasure.\\" Festivals The shrine's torii Over 70 ceremonies and festivals are held annually at the shrine.Japan National Tourist Organization (JNTO): Atsuta-jing≈´ Shrine. * Hatsu-Ebisu (January 5): Seeking good fortune in the new year from Ebisu, the kami of Fortune.Atsuta-jing≈´ org: \\"Festivals.\\" * Yodameshi Shinji (January 7): The projected annual rainfall for the coming year is prophesied by measuring the amount of water in a pot kept underneath the floor of the Eastern Treasure House. * Touka Shinji (January 11): A variation on an annual ceremony (Touka- no-sechie) of the Imperial Court in the Heian period (10th-12th Century), the shrine dance becomes a prayer in movement hoping for bumper crops of the year. * Hosha Shinji (January 15): Ceremonial which involves shooting an arrow at a wooden piece called chigi fixed at the center of a huge mark. * Bugaku Shinji (May 1): A ceremonial dance from the Heian era is performed outdoors on a red painted stage. * Eyoudo Shinji (May 4): A festival to commemorate the return of the sacred sword in the reign of Emperor Tenji. * Shinyo-Togyo Shinji (May 5): A festival in which portable shrine (mikoshi) is carried in a formal procession to the Western Gate, where ceremonies and prayers for the security of the Imperial Palace are performed in the open air. In the Meiji period and Taisho period, this procession moved in sober and solemn silence. The ceremony at the gate was brief, lasting only 20 minutes; and then the mikoshi and its attendants returned into the Shrine precincts. Sh≈çgun Ashikaga Yoshimasa provided a new mikoshi and a complete set of robes and other accouterments for this festival on the occasion of repairs to the shrine in the 1457-1459 (Ch≈çroku 1-3).Ponsonby-Fane, p. 452. * Rei Sai (June 5): Portable tabernacles (mikoshi) in various styles are carried along the approaches to the shrine; and at night, groups of 365 lanterns (makiwara) appear lit at the gates.

The set contains song demos by Pete Townshend; including solo versions of \\"Baba O'Riley\\", \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", and \\"Who Are You\\", and the Lifehouse Radio Program. The box set release was followed by two Sadler's Wells Lifehouse concerts and the release of a live CD and video/DVD titled, respectively, Pete Townshend Live: Sadler's Wells 2000 and Pete Townshend ‚Äì Music from Lifehouse. Lifehouse: the concept The set collects songs and other compositions relating to Lifehouse, a musical concept developed by Townshend in 1970 as a follow-up to The Who's highly successful rock opera, Tommy. Rooted heavily in the teachings of Townshend's spiritual mentor Meher Baba as well as in science fiction literature, Lifehouse was meant to explore the idea that music is the fundamental basis of all life ‚Äì that every human being on Earth has a unique musical melody that \\"describes\\" them, and only them, perfectly. When the unique songs of enough people are played in unison, the result would be a single harmonic note ‚Äì the One Note ‚Äì akin to the quintessence sought by ancient alchemists. Lifehouse was to be a true multimedia project: a double LP rock opera, a motion picture, and an interactive concert experience. The story was to take place in 21st century Britain, in an age where pollution has become such a drastic problem that most people never set foot outdoors in their life. This populace spends most of their time in \\"experience suits\\". These suits provide the people with artificial lives superior to any they could eke out in the real world, yet devoid somehow of spiritual fulfilment. One discontented soul, known only as \\"The Hacker\\", rediscovers 20th century rock and roll music, and breaks into the computer network controlling the suits to invite people to leave their suits and come together for a concert. Despite the best efforts of the fascist government, thousands of people gather at the Hacker's concert, with millions more watching through their suits, as the musicians and audience perform experimental songs like those described above. Just as the police storm in and shoot the Hacker, the audience and band manage simultaneously to produce the perfect universal tone, The One Note, and everyone participating in and watching the concert simply vanishes, presumably having departed for a higher plane of existence. The story is seen through the eyes of a middle-aged farmer named Ray, a farmer from a remote unpolluted corner of Scotland, who travels south looking for his daughter who has run away to the concert. Lifehouse: 1970‚Äì1971 In September 1970, Townshend penned a song called \\"Pure and Easy\\", about the One Note, the first song written specifically for Lifehouse. In the following two months he wrote approximately 20 additional songs, recording intricate home demos of each. Rather than attempting to tell the story through the lyrics, as he had done with Tommy, the songs were stand-alone pieces, meant to be elucidated by the movie and detailed sleeve notes to be included with the album. Most of those songs were recorded by the Who in two sessions in the winter of 1970/1971, as well as several \\"rehearsals\\" accompanied by guitarist Leslie West of the band Mountain and an impromptu live concert at the Young Vic Theatre in London in April 1971. While Townshend had high hopes for the project, others were sceptical. Universal Studios, which had recently inked a two-film deal with the Who for the rights to a film version of Tommy, was not impressed by the screenplay Townshend offered them. A series of spontaneous concerts the Who had held in London failed to produce usable material, and it soon became apparent that the project was doomed to failure. Though many of the songs written for Lifehouse came to be released on the Who album Who's Next, Lifehouse was to remain unfinished for nearly thirty years. Lifehouse: 1971‚Äì1998 Townshend never abandoned hope that Lifehouse might someday become a reality. He continued to write songs for the project throughout the '70s, and in 1980 worked together with bandmate John Entwistle to produce a new screenplay with a new story. Negotiations to produce this film, however, fell apart when Townshend found himself infatuated with the wife of the film's director (a story recounted in the song \\"Athena\\", to be found on the Who album It's Hard). It was not until 1992 that Townshend again began work on the project. In that year, Townshend recorded the solo album Psychoderelict, a semi-biographical story told in the style of a radio play. The hero of this piece, like Townshend, is an aging rock star labouring tirelessly on a 20-year-old rock opera, called \\"Gridlife Chronicles\\" in the story, who finds himself embroiled in a sex scandal that jeopardises the future of the project. Several of the synthesizer pieces Townshend recorded in 1970 make their first official appearance on this album. In 1998, Townshend's dream of bringing Lifehouse to a wide audience finally came true, when BBC Radio approached him with the idea of developing a radio play based on Lifehouse and incorporating the original music written for the project. The play, just under two hours in length, was transmitted on BBC Radio 3 on 5 December 1999. The box set Following the broadcast of the play, Townshend assembled and released the Lifehouse Chronicles box set in 2000 as a formal culmination of his work on the project. The set, made available exclusively through his website and at concerts, consists of six CDs. The first two CDs collect the original demos he recorded of the Lifehouse songs, several of which were never recorded by The Who. The third disc consists of several of Townshend's experimental synthesizer pieces, live recordings of Lifehouse songs, and new studio recordings of those songs produced especially for the set. The fourth disc features classical music by the London Chamber Orchestra which was used in the radio play, featuring compositions by Townshend as well as selections by Baroque composers Henry Purcell, Domenico Scarlatti and Michel Corrette. The fifth and sixth discs contain the radio play itself. Included with the set is a booklet featuring an introduction by Townshend, a history of the project written by Townshend webmaster/publicist Matt Kent , lyrics for most of the Lifehouse songs, and a script of the play. Townshend stated in his introduction that he eventually hoped to release an expanded version of the set, to be titled \\"The Lifehouse Method\\", which would include software for producing a synthesizer track based on the user's vital statistics. Instead, The Lifehouse Method debuted in early 2007 as a website. After generating some 10,000 new pieces of music for users, the project closed. Graphic design was by Laurence Sutherland.

The game was marketed as a humorous spoof of fantasy role-playing video games. It is neither a remake nor a sequel to Interplay Productions' Tales of the Unknown, Volume I: The Bard's Tale (1985). The Bard's Tale was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in October 2004. It was released for Microsoft Windows in June 2005. The game was re-released on Steam in December 2009. A universal iOS version was released in December 2011 for iPhone and iPad along with the Android version. The BlackBerry PlayBook version was released in September 2012. In June 2013, the game was also ported to Ouya with full controller support. Gameplay Unlike the turn-based, first-person view of the classic Bard's Tale games, this game is in a 3D environment with the player watching the only controllable character from an overhead vantage point. It is better described as an action-adventure game than a traditional role-playing video game (i.e. there are no character classes or inventory management). The player's character, The Bard, has magic and weaponry at his disposal to complete the task. The more the player accomplishes, the better his skills will become. The appearance and gameplay is much the same as the Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance series, which shares the same graphics engine. In game dialog uses a \\"snarky or nice\\" system that allows the player to change the outcome of many situations by deciding how they want to respond. The player doesn't know exactly what the bard will say, but must choose between two labeled buttons. Some choices, such as being snarky to the dog at the beginning of the game, have game-lasting consequences. The first decision is whether to be nice or snarky to the barmaid in The Drunken Rat. Being nice to her gives her the impression that the Bard is a gentleman and she leaves him alone, while being snarky ensures the Bard will spend the night with her. Plot An advertisement for the game prior to release showing The Bard following the path \\"Coin & Cleavage\\" as opposed to \\"Save the World\\" Although touted in early promotional materials as a remake of the classic Bard's Tale series, InXile Entertainment never had any rights to the series' trademarks of the original Bard's Tale ‚Äî those rights are still owned by Electronic Arts. This meant that InXile was not legally allowed to use any of the plot, characters or locations featured in the original trilogy. However, allusions to the original Bard's Tale do exist in the game. The city in which Fionnaoch's tower stands, Dounby, is only a few kilometers away from the ruins of real-world Skara Brae, where the original trilogy takes place. The PC, Android, and iOS ports of The Bard's Tale comes packaged with the original Bard's Tale trilogy. The plot involves \\"a sardonic and opportunistic musician and adventurer, driven by carnal rather than noble pursuits. The Bard, who is never identified by a specific name nor addressed by anything other than 'The Bard,' is not interested in saving the world; his humble motivations are strictly 'coin and cleavage.'\\" His quest is narrated by a mocking, biased man (played by Tony Jay) who cannot stand him. Many of the names and characters are influenced by Celtic mythology and the stories of the Orkney Islands. (Most of the names for places are actual locations in the Orkney Islands, including Kirkwall, Dounby, Finstown, Houton, and Stromness. Some optional areas are places in Ireland, including D√∫n Ailinne, Ardagh, Carrowmore, Emain Macha, and Tara.) The Bard (voiced by Cary Elwes) ends up being recruited by a cult to help free a princess named Caleigh. As a result of this, the Bard finds himself being attacked by an assortment of fanatics from a Druid-like cult, sent to dispatch him by a being called Fionnaoch. On the way to complete his quest, the not so valiant anti-hero will have to overcome the truly terrifying challenges of three monstrous guardians, break-dancing corpses, spontaneously melodious goblins, a giant, and a fire-breathing rat. Eventually, it is revealed that the Bard is just another in a long line of \\"Chosen Ones,\\" many of whom he finds dead along his path. Caleigh is revealed to actually be a demon tempting people to come free her for years on the assumption that eventually someone would succeed. If the Bard frees Caleigh, she gives him all his heart's desires while destroying the world. If he slays Caleigh, The Bard returns to the road in search of the next bar maid. Alternatively, he can refuse to fight either the Druid Leader or Caleigh, allowing the undead to overrun the world, a situation he is content with as they make good bar buddies.  Reception  The PlayStation 2, Xbox, and iOS versions received \\"favorable\\" reviews, while the PC version received \\"average\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. The A.V. Club gave the iOS version a score of B+, praising the narration of Tony Jay, \\"whose incredulity and exasperation with pretty much everything in the game is a warm delight.\\" Detroit Free Press awarded the Xbox version three stars out of four and opined it was \\"one of the few games that is downright funny, and there were honest laugh-out-loud moments sprinkled throughout it that kept me playing.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald gave the PlayStation 2 version a score of three-and-a-half stars out of five: \\"The story and dialogue never cease to entertain. Objectives include rescuing prisoners, killing fearsome scarecrows and playing Cupid.

It is the longest place name in South Africa, and one of the longest anywhere in the world. The name, which follows a common format for Afrikaans-language place names in South Africa, means \\"the spring where two buffaloes were killed with a single shot\\" (). The literal translation is \\"Twee buffels\\" = \\"Two buffaloes\\", \\"met een skoot\\" = \\"with one shot\\"; \\"\\" = \\"stone dead\\"; \\"\\" = \\"shot\\"; \\"\\" = \\"spring (river source)\\" or \\"fountain\\". This name illustrates the compounding nature of Germanic languages including Afrikaans, itself derived from Dutch. All the descriptive terms relating to one concept can generally be tied together into one long word. Another example of this would be , which translates to \\"wild watermelon jam competition judge's manual\\". Such use is, however, not common, and such words are often separated using one or more hyphens if they become too long or unwieldy. The farm was originally granted to A.P. de Nysschen in 1866 by the government of the South African Republic; it is referred to in the survey diagram as \\"\\" (Two buffaloes shot) and shown as having an area of 6119 morgen and 429 square roods (5241.7 hectares). Official maps published by National Geo-spatial Information refer to it as \\"\\" (Two buffaloes). The name was used as the title for an Afrikaans-language song co-written by Anton Goosen and and performed by Goosen. It has also been used in advertising to signify the typical small rural town.

Hungarian dancer Born in the Eastern name order in Budapest of Czech extraction and nicknamed Stefi (Stef√°nia) by her friends and family, Duna started dancing at the age of nine and first attracted attention as a thirteen-year-old ballet dancer in Europe. Duna made her first stage appearance performing dramatized fairy tales at the Children's Theater of Budapest. Initially opposed to the idea, her father sent her to the best schools in the Hungarian capital to learn dancing and soon she had danced in most of the capitals of Europe. In 1932, she appeared on the London stage in the revue Words and Music by No√´l Coward, being one of the four actresses to create the song \\"Mad about the Boy\\". Movie actress When she first came to Hollywood in 1932, Duna could not speak a word of English. She made up her mind to learn quickly. Directors advised her to stay away from her Hungarian friends to speed up her learning of English. Within a few years she could speak six different languages. During the 1930s Duna played a variety of nationalities. However, despite her European background, she was often cast as fiery Latin femmes fatales in films that made full use of her exotic and glamorous persona, such as La Cucaracha (1934), the first live-action short film made in three-strip Technicolor. She made her film debut in The Indiscretions of Eve (1932) in the starring role (along with Jessica Tandy, also making her debut). Signed by RKO Radio Pictures, Duna played \\"Guninana\\", the Eskimo wife of Francis Lederer, in Man of Two Worlds (1934). Lederer had performed with Duna in the Berlin, Germany presentation of Die Wunderbar. In 1936, she played the part of Nedda in the British film version of Pagliacci, starring Richard Tauber. Films in which she played lead roles, such as Panama Lady (1939) with Lucille Ball, were popular but did not make her a major star. Her best remembered films include Anthony Adverse (1936) and Waterloo Bridge (1940). Marriages Duna was married first to the actor John Carroll, with whom she had starred in Hi, Gaucho!; the marriage produced one child, a daughter. They divorced in 1938. In 1940 she married actor Dennis O'Keefe; This marriage produced two children a son and a daughter. They remained together until his death. Death Duna retired from acting in 1940 and died in May 1992 of cancer at her home in Beverly Hills.

It owes its name to an English-American chocolate maker named Samuel German, who developed a formulation of dark baking chocolate that came to be used in the cake recipe. Sweet baking chocolate is traditionally used for the chocolate flavor in the actual cake, but few recipes call for it today. The filling and/or topping is a custard made with egg yolks and evaporated milk; once the custard is cooked, coconut and pecans are stirred in. Occasionally, a chocolate frosting is spread on the sides of the cake and piped around the circumference of the layers to hold in the filling. Maraschino cherries are occasionally added as a garnish. History Its roots can be traced back to 1852 when American baker Samuel German developed a type of dark baking chocolate for the Baker's Chocolate Company. The brand name of the product, Baker's German's Sweet Chocolate, was named in honor of him. On June 3, 1957, a recipe for \\"German's Chocolate Cake\\" appeared as the \\"Recipe of the Day\\" in The Dallas Morning News. It was created by Mrs. George Clay, a homemaker from 3831 Academy Drive, Dallas, Texas. This recipe used the baking chocolate introduced 105 years prior and became quite popular. General Foods, which owned the Baker's brand at the time, took notice and distributed the cake recipe to other newspapers in the country. Sales of Baker's Chocolate are said to have increased by as much as 73% and the cake would become a national staple. The possessive form (German's) was dropped in subsequent publications, forming the \\"German Chocolate Cake\\" identity and giving the false impression of a German origin. The recipe still remains popular to this day and has been adopted by baking companies.

Since then all three papers have been renamed as The Shuttle incorporating the Kidderminster Shuttle, the Kidderminster Times and the Stourport News.

The paper remains a local institution in the Kidderminster area, notably with its in-depth coverage of local politics and Kidderminster Harriers F.C..

The current editor of the Shuttle is Peter John.Contact Us The Shuttle.

The Newsquest head office is based in Weybridge, Surrey and employs a total of more than 9,100 people across the UK. In 2009, the newspaper carried advertisements on both its online and print editions from the British National Party, resulting in widespread condemnation.http://www.kidderminstershuttle.co.uk/news/letters/4396366.Shuttle_under_fire_over_BNP_adverts/  History  The Kidderminster Shuttle was founded by Edward Parry, a Unitarian minister, local headmaster, and local politician who became Mayor of Kidderminster in 1898 and in 1899. In 1870 he bought an old flour mill in Mill Street and opened it as a printing office. Edward Parry, with little knowledge of the printing and newspaper interest and little starting capital, purchased a second-hand steam-driven printing machine that was then the first of its kind in Kidderminster. Other equipment necessary for newspaper printing was bought second-hand from Mr. Friend, who once ran a printing business in the Bull Ring, Kidderminster. The first edition of the Kidderminster Shuttle was produced on 12 February 1870. After only 12 months of trading an office for reporters and staff was created in Oxford Street, Kidderminster. The steam- driven printing press required a lot of maintenance and most often had to be dismantled and cleaned before it would work, so it was replaced by a horizontal gas engine driven press. So in 1884 with this faster and more economical press the format of the newspaper was enlarged. Edward Parry was a keen supporter of the Liberal Party policies and in 1890, he gave most of the responsibilities of running the newspaper to William Wimbury, who started with the company as a reporter in 1871. This gave him more time to concentrate on public life, as he was elected to the Town Council of Kidderminster for the Park ward, as a Liberal councillor. The Kidderminster Shuttle during this time heavily supported Liberal politics, and so in 1891 Frank Fearneley founded The Sun newspaper (also known as the Kidderminster Sun) as an outlet for promoting Conservative Party policies. The Sun was printed first in the Bull Ring, Kidderminster but soon after moved to Trinity Lane, also in Kidderminster. During the Sun's reign many editorials were written in both papers attacking each other, however, the Sun was short-lived. Soon after the demise of the Sun J. G. Dalton founded the Kidderminster Times, but this newspaper was also short-lived and became absorbed into the Shuttle. The Shuttle however grew in circulation and by the turn of the 20th century the Shuttle started to produce directories and other publications. During the First World War the Shuttle was an invaluable means to get messages from families at home to the soldiers on the battlefields, and also stories and pictures of men at war were published. This war effort compelled the purchase of a double-demy cylinder machine and the introduction of the point system of printing, along with Lanston monotype type setting. At the end of the war and coming into the 1920s the Shuttle which was still chiefly run by Edward Parry and William Wimbury, but Wimbury became ill and died in 1920. Also Edward Parry became unable to run the business so it was passed over to his two sons, Clive Parry and Arthur Parry. They were supported from Fred W. Yates, who started as a printer's devil and worked his way up the organisation. The responsibilities were split between the two brothers; Clive Parry looked after the printing side of the business while Arthur Parry concerned himself with the newspaper and journalistic side of the business. In the 1920s the Shuttle seemed to be in jeopardy. In 1926, Edward Parry died at the age of 98, and so ended his 56 years of commitment to the newspaper. His son, Arthur Parry became ill from the stress of running the newspaper and the death of his father. During the 1920s a rival newspaper, the County Express from Stourbridge, wanted to extend their circulation to the Kidderminster area and even produced a Kidderminster edition of his newspaper. However, in the same year that Edward Parry died, Lt. Col. A. H. Moody, proprietor of the County Express, also died. His widow kept on his wish for expansion into Kidderminster and so on 11 July 1931 the County Express bought the Shuttle. The County Express decided to keep the two newspapers to run separately and appointed Fred W. Yates as editor. This acquisition accounted for big changes in The Shuttle, printing of the newspaper was moved from the flat-bed machinery in Kidderminster to the County Express's rotary press in Stourbridge. Most of the type setting was also moved from Kidderminster to Stourbridge. The style of the newspaper was totally revamped, and London agents were used to handle advertising aspect of the business. The change was seen as a success as the number of advertisers rose rapidly and the popularity of the newspaper improved. The change was set back, however, with the Second World War, availability of paper and ink were in short supply and strict censorship was applied to all newspaper at this time. The paper was cut down in size and in staff. It took five years after the end of the war for the newspaper to recover.

The company was also involved in television broadcasting, and was a leader in data, video, graphics displays and projectors. From 1984 to 1999, Electrohome-branded TVs were produced under licence by Mitsubishi Electric, and from 1999 to 2007 by Jutan (distributed by Canadian distributor Citizen Electronics). The company underwent an orderly wind-up in late 2008. In February 2010, the Electrohome brand was acquired by Bluetronics Group a division of Circus World Displays Limited (CWD). History In 1907 Arthur Bell Pollock founded Pollock Manufacturing Co. Ltd., after winning a coin flip with his wife. The Kitchener, Ontario company manufactured the first phonographs in Canada. In the 1920s and 30s the company branched out into other consumer goods such as records, radios, furniture, and was the largest Canadian maker of electric fans. In 1933 the company name became Dominion Electrohome Industries Ltd. and the Electrohome brand was introduced for products ranging from heaters to food mixers. With the outbreak of World War II, however, everything changed. Electrohome devoted 99% of its production to the war effort. It manufactured wooden aircraft elements including wings, munitions components, and communications equipment, including a radio transmitter for the Royal Canadian Air Force. After the war, Electrohome ranked as a nationally known and important company with 1,400 employees geared to meet the demands of the post-war economy. The war enabled the company to acquire new equipment, more production capacity and a wider range of skills. There was also a perception that Electrohome could be a major player on the Canadian national electronics scene. The company began manufacturing and selling television sets in 1949, competing with companies such as Northern Electric and Canadian General Electric for a share of the Canadian market. Electrohome developed its reputation with large console model TV sets made with real hardwood cases. In 1954, Carl Arthur Pollock, son of the company's founder, led Electrohome in joining the Famous Players theatre chain to launch Kitchener-Waterloo's first television station, CKCO-TV, as a CBC Television affiliate. It joined CTV in 1964. Electrohome assumed full control of CKCO in 1970 when broadcasting laws substantially reduced the amount of foreign ownership in Canadian media (Famous Players was controlled by Paramount Pictures). In the 1960s, Electrohome continued to manufacture consumer products including organs, radios, console stereos, speakers, high fidelity tube amplifiers, and televisions, as it became the first and only Canadian company to make colour television sets. By 1965, Electrohome products were being sold in 23 countries. Total sales in 1968 were $44.5 million. Over the years the company had ten manufacturing plants and two administrative offices in the Kitchener-Waterloo area. In 1972, John A. Pollock, grandson of the company founder, became the third generation president of Electrohome. By this time Electrohome was widely known as the Canadian equivalent of US companies like General Electric or RCA. Pollock led the company into a number of different electronics ventures and products, both consumer and industrial. Electrohome's most successful products during this period were a line of display projectors that evolved from single CRT monochrome data projectors into stereoscopic virtual reality projectors and digital movie theater projectors, based on the Texas Instruments Digital Light Processing technology. In 1984, suffering from years of competition with Sony and other Japanese television makers, Electrohome ceased production of TV sets, and licensed the brand name to Mitsubishi Electric. In 1988, Electrohome purchased a second television station, CFRN-TV in Edmonton. In 1995, Electrohome and Baton Broadcasting entered a partnership, sharing ownership of CKCO, CFRN, CFCN-TV in Calgary, CFPL-TV in London, CHWI-TV in Wheatley and CKNX-TV in Wingham. The following year, the partnership was reorganized: Baton took over full ownership of all of the stations ‚Äì and with it, controlling interest in CTV. In return, Electrohome received cash and shares in Baton worth $270 Million Canadian, which changed its name to CTV Inc. a year later. Since 2002 CTV has been the top rated Canadian TV network. In 1999, Electrohome sold the projection systems division to Christie Digital, a leading film projector manufacturer. In 1999, Electrohome switched licensees, dropping Mitsubishi Electric and allowing Canadian distributor Citizen Electronics (Jutan) to market TVs and DVD players under the Electrohome brand name. On March 5, 2007, the Redmond Group of Companies announced the purchase of Electrohome brands effective January 1, 2008. Later that month, on March 27, Synnex announced the purchase of the Redmond Group Electrohome assets. In January 2008, Electrohome announced the sale of all of its trademarks to Synnex Corporation. Electrohome now derived most of its income from its licensing, minor stock holdings in Mechdyne/Fakespace Systems which provides visualization solutions for data analysis, and owns digital cinema firm Immersion Studios. The company began an orderly wind-up in late 2008. In February 2010, the Electrohome brand was acquired by Bluetronics Group, a division of Circus World Displays Limited (CWD). Also included in the purchase were the rights to Magnasonic, Secureguard and Citizen (Canada only) brands, amongst many others. Based in Niagara Falls, Canada, CWD also owns and operates other brands including Fluance, Nyrius, Levana, SVAT, Defender and Pure Therapy. Plant 4 View of the 152 Shanley Street factory being demolished in January 2020. Electrohome Plant 4 was located at 152 Shanley Street in Kitchener. Built in 1898, it was originally a factory for the Diamond (or L. C. Klippert) Furniture Company, run by industrialist Leander Klippert. The company only lasted until 1902, and the factory sat vacant until 1905, when it became occupied by the Walker Bin and Store Fixture Company. Walker's was run by William McCuaig until 1912, then Oliver Kinzie. The company produced a variety of retail store furniture such as store counters, wall bins, floor racks, and display units. In 1928, Walker's was taken over by a larger American furniture concern, Jones Brothers, which operated the factory until 1931 when production ended due to the Great Depression. The building was yet again disused until 1934, when brothers J. Hogarth and J. North Kennedy operated a fine bedroom and dining room furniture manufacturing company, Kennedy's, out of the building. However, the company was short-lived, and the building was once again vacant from 1935 to mid-1937, when it was taken over by Murawsky's Furniture. Martin Murawsky was a Polish immigrant who had arrived in Kitchener as a child in 1876. With his sons, he had operated his own company, Murawsky's Furniture, out of a plant at 152 Victoria Street, near Park Street. They would operate the Shanley Street plant for sixteen years, until Murawsky's, by then run by Martin's sons, decided to focus on chair manufacturing and pivot toward the rapidly growing retail industry. As a result, they sold the Shanley Street plant to Dominion Electrohome. Electrohome initially used the plant to manufacture its Deilcraft brand of furniture, but by the mid-1950s was also using it for lighting and heating appliance manufacturing, as well as storage. The company sold the building in 1968 to Morval Durofoam Products. Morval occupied the site until around 1980, where it manufactured plastic and foam products for auto interiors, as well as specialty packaging products. After this, the plant was sold to its final major occupant, Art Rite Advertising, which used the site until 1991. In the years afterward, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment became aware that the property was heavily contaminated with various metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and trichloroethylene (TCE), a toxic industrial solvent. This would prove to be the century-old factory's undoing. For the next few decades, parties ranging from local residents to various government bodies worked toward environmental remediation of the site and the possibly of redevelopment, with or without the original factory structure. In 2007, the Ministry of the Environment issued a cleanup order, but the property's owner, an absentee numbered company, failed to do so, to undertake basic property maintenance, or even to pay municipal property taxes. In 2011, the City of Kitchener attempted a tax sale of the property after visible deterioration of the brick facade was observed. This was unsuccessful, and followed in 2018 by a second attempt, with the price being dropped to around $450,000. By 2019, the city had written off much of the back taxes owed for the property, and issued an order to have an engineer evaluate whether the factory building was still structurally sound. In late 2019, the property was purchased by a Toronto-based developer, which announced plans to demolish the plant and build a mixed-use development on the site, which would incorporate aspects of the original structure. Demolition began in January 2020.

The game is set in the American Old West, where the player takes control of a bounty hunter who is seeking the rewards offered for various criminals. The coin-op version was released in two variants: a two-player version and a four-player version. Home console versions of Sunset Riders were released for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis in 1992 and for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993, to a positive reception. An emulated version of the arcade original was released by Hamster Corporation for the Nintendo Switch and PS4 as part of the company's Arcade Archives series. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot showing Steve on the game's third level The game, which is set in a fanciful version of the American Old West, revolves around four bounty hunters named Steve, Billy Cool, Bob, and Cormano Wild, who are out to claim rewards offered for eliminating the most wanted outlaws in the West. At the beginning of each stage, the players are shown a wanted poster for the outlaw they will face at its end. Sunset Riders has gameplay that is similar to both Contra and Vendetta. This cooperative shooter can also be played up to two or four players simultaneously, depending on the version of the game. In the two- player version each player can choose which of the four bounty hunters to play as at the start of the game, while in the four-player version each character is assigned to a different control panel. Steve and Billy wield revolvers, Bob carries a rifle, and Cormano uses a double barrel shotgun. The controls consist of an eight-way joystick for moving and aiming, and two buttons for shooting and jumping. The player(s) can jump between higher/lower floors and slide to avoid enemy attacks. The objective of the game is to defeat a gang of outlaws in eight stages, with a fight against a strong boss character at the end of each. When two or more people are playing, the one who deals the most damage to a stage boss receives the entire bonus for defeating him. Five of the stages are played on foot, two on horseback, and one on a moving train. A bonus minigame is played after the second and fifth stages, in which the player(s) can earn additional points by shooting outlaws as they pop up. After all eight stages are cleared, the game restarts with increased difficulty. Power-ups and bonus items can be obtained by entering doorways, defeating certain sack-carrying bandits, or opening sacks placed on the ground. Two power-ups are available, a gold sheriff's badge that grants fully automatic fire and a silver one that gives the player a second gun. Both power-ups can be equipped at once. Other weapons that can be used by the player include dynamite carried by female bandits (which must be thrown back before it explodes), hanging rocks/barrels/torches that can be dropped on enemies, and mounted Gatling guns available only in the last stage. An easter egg involves the defeat of the boss in the fifth stage; if Cormano is active at this point, he will catch the boss's sombrero and wear it for the remainder of the game. One life is lost whenever the player is hit by any enemy attack, trampled by bulls, caught in a fire or explosion, or struck by a rock or obstacle. Any power-ups that a player has gained are also lost. After all lives are lost, the player may continue the game by inserting more credits, but he has a limited amount of time to do so before the game defaults to a game over screen. =Characters= There are four playable bounty hunters in the game who are out to claim rewards offered for eliminating the most wanted outlaws in the West. In the Sega Genesis version however there are only two playable bounty hunters. Billy Cool is a bounty hunter who wields a revolver and speaks in a western country accent. Cormano Wild is a bounty hunter wearing a Mexican poncho and a sombrero who wields a double barrel shotgun. He later wears a red sombrero worn by El Greco after neutralizing him. Bob is a bounty hunter wielding a rifle who speaks in a southern American accent. Steve is a bounty hunter who also wields revolvers similar to Billy's, though his bullets from his revolver appear to be more powerful than Billy's own bullets. =Wanted Outlaws= The outlaws are the recurring bosses of the game as Richard Rose is the final boss at the end of the game. Simon Greedwell is a rich and greedy outlaw who is the boss of the first stage. He wields a shotgun while ordering his men to deal with the bounty hunters. His last words on death are \\"Bury me with my money.\\" Hawkeye Hank Hatfield is a rich outlaw who is known to shoot a gun in one hand and the boss of the second stage. Despite his efforts to kill the bounty hunters, he was neutralized. Dark Horse is a muscular outlaw who rides an armored horse. He is the boss of the third stage. Once he is neutralized by the bounty hunters, the armored horse runs away along with his corpse. The Smith Brothers are siblings and outlaws who cause trouble inside a saloon owned by a beautiful woman. They are the bosses of the fourth stage, fought immediately after Dark Horse. After the bounty hunters neutralize the brothers, they watch the dance performance of three beautiful women on stage, who then inform the bounty hunters about Richard Rose and his three henchmen. El Greco is one of Richard Rose's henchmen and a Mexican outlaw serving as the boss of the fifth stage. He carries a shield to deflect shots and a whip. Once he is neutralized by the bounty hunters, El Greco tosses away his red Mexican sombrero. If Cormano is being played, he will catch the hat and wear it in place of his own for the rest of the game. Chief Scalpem is a chief from the native American tribe, an expert in knife throwing and one of Richard Rose's henchmen, serving as the boss of the sixth stage. Despite his efforts to defeat the bounty hunters, he was neutralized but was soon spared by the bounty hunters due to his younger sister's plea knowing he was following Richard's orders. In the Sega Genesis version, Scalpem serves as the boss of the third stage. Paco Loco is a hulking outlaw who wields a gatling gun, and is one of Richard Rose's henchmen, serving as the boss in the seventh stage. Once he is neutralized by the bounty hunters, his last words are Hasta la Bye Bye! referencing the T-800's main catchphrase in the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. In the Sega Genesis version, Paco Loco serves as the boss of the second stage. Sir Richard Rose is a rich and elegant outlaw, and the main villain of the series, serving as the final boss of the game. He is an expert gunslinger, using his revolver in one hand, and demonstrating his agility at a fast pace. Upon his first \\"death\\" he reveals he is using a metal plate to cover his chest and avoid injury. After the second phase, he is finally neutralized by the bounty hunters, symbolized by a graphic showing a single rose being destroyed (not shown in the SNES version). In the Sega Genesis version, he serves as the boss in the fourth and final stage. Release Sunset Riders arcade PCB Sunset Riders was showcased at the 1991 Las Vegas Amusement Expo. Sunset Riders was originally released for arcades in September 1991. Two years later, the arcade version was reprogrammed to two home consoles. The home versions were only released in North America and Europe. =Sega Genesis= The Mega Drive/Genesis version of Sunset Riders features the most changes made to the game between the two home versions of the game. Out of the four main characters from the arcade game, only Billy and Cormano are featured. The two characters in the Genesis version were given surnames that they originally did not have in the arcade version (Billy Cool and Cormano Wild). The controls are identical to the arcade version aside from the addition of two shooting buttons instead of just one: one button allows the player to walk and shoot at the same time, while the other shoot button keeps the character still when pressed down, allowing the player to change their aim only. Only four of the eight bosses from the arcade version are featured (Simon Greedwell, Paco Loco, Chief Scalpem, and Sir Richard Rose), and each of the four chapters are divided into two stages. Each boss dialogue is worded in a text bubble instead of voiced. The power-up icons have also been replaced as well. Unlike the other versions, the player can cause a dynamite stick to explode by shooting it. To access the bonus stages, the player must collect a Star-shaped item located in either stage of each chapter. The bonus stages also differ from the ones in the arcade version: the player chases after a moving wagon on horseback, while the woman in the wagon tosses bonus coins and extra lives at the player's path. In addition to the standard game mode, the Mega Drive/Genesis version features a two-player versus mode. The players must shoot each other until one of the players runs out of health. =Super NES= In contrast to the Genesis version, the SNES version of Sunset Riders features relatively few changes. The barfly that kisses the player character in Stage 1 as well as the saloon dancers from Stage 4 are dressed more conservatively compared to the arcade version. Hunter dogs, which were present in the first segment of the final chapter in the Genesis version, were removed. The Native American enemy characters from Stage 6 were removed and replaced with regular outlaws, leaving only Chief Scalpem (who is renamed Chief Wigwam and re-voiced in the SNES game) as the stage boss. The dynamite-tossing female bandits were replaced with male bandits as well. All boss and cutscene dialogues are subtitled. While most voice clips are carried over from the arcade, some voice lines are either re-worded or replaced with other less offensive lines for censorship purposes. =Arcade Archives re-release= In March 2020, during the 242nd Arcade Archiver livestream, Hamster Corporation announced a port of the arcade version of Sunset Riders for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 as part of their Arcade Archives banner. It was released in Japan on June 11, 2020. This port is censored, however, with the stage 5 boss, El Greco, saying, ‚ÄúAdios, amigo!‚Äù as your battle with him begins, in place of ‚ÄúDie, gringo!‚Äù, which he says in the original game. Additionally, the stage 6 boss, originally named Chief Scalpem in the arcade release, is renamed Chief Wigwam. Both of these changes were also present in the SNES port. A Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles poster that appears during the stage 2 boss fight has also been removed. These changes are present in both the North American and Japanese versions in the Arcade Archives release. Reception Sunset Riders was mostly very well-received by video game press. In Japan, Game Machine listed it on their December 15, 1991 issue as being the third most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Sinclair User gave the arcade game an 82 out of 100, opining it \\"plays very well and should prove an interesting challenge for your finely honed arcade skills.\\"Sunset Riders review. Sinclair User. December 1991. p. 62 In a more reserved review, Zero rated the arcade original a 3 out of 5, calling it a \\"fairly fast shoot'em up with a sense of humour.\\" The \\"rather splendid\\" SNES version was given an overall score of 87% by Dan Jevons from Super Play, who described it as \\"another winner from Konami's stable;\\" it also received an 88% and an 89% from two reviewers in SNES Force. Hobby Consolas gave the scores of 86% to the SNES version and 78% for the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis one, while Mean Machines Sega rated the latter as 84%, noting it as \\"surprisingly good\\". Retrospectively, Jamie O'Neill from Nintendo Life awarded this version eight stars out of ten, writing it \\"is bright, colourful, fantastically well animated, with superb music and sound. It understands its place as a Western game and within the run-and-gun genre, by combining imaginative characterisation and humour, with well-paced action set-pieces, plus variety in its gameplay.\\" Retro Game Age gave it the same score as well, opining \\"Sunset Riders remains a fun romp that still presents some challenge to get through and is just as fun to play now as it was almost 20 years ago.\\" IGN ranked it as the 88th best game the SNES. Nick Gibson from Sega-16 rated the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis port a 7 out of 10, while the arcade original was rated 80% by Arcade Attack.

The latter option involved a \\"draft\\" in which each team selected players who then were not available for other teams to select. The draft for the 1960 season was actually conducted in late 1959, shortly after the formation of the league. Thereafter, American Football League drafts were conducted separately from the rival NFL through 1966. Starting in 1967, after the NFL agreed to merge with the AFL, the two leagues conducted a \\"common draft\\", which was in turn replaced with the modern NFL draft in 1970, upon the completion of the AFL/NFL merger. In 1961 and 1962, the American Football League drafts were \\"regional\\". Teams were assigned broad geographical regions around their home city, and had \\"rights\\" to the players within those regions. The AFL's owners reckoned that players would be more willing to play in their league if they had the opportunity to sign with their \\"home town\\" teams, and also hoped to attract fans with players with whom they had some familiarity. The AFL also tapped sources which the NFL had disdained: smaller colleges (non Division I-A) and all-black colleges. During the years in which the American Football League was in direct competition with the NFL for players (and fans), numerous star players chose to play in the AFL. The first and one of the most prominent of these was LSU All-American Billy Cannon, who went on to become an AFL All-Star both as a running back with the Houston Oilers and as a tight end with the Oakland Raiders.

Makoto Uchida was the lead designer of the game, and was also responsible for the creation of the previous year's Altered Beast. The game casts players as one of three warriors who must free the fantastical land of Yuria from the tyrannical rule of Death Adder, who wields the titular Golden Axe. Well received at the time of release, Golden Axe was later converted for play on many different home systems, including Sega's own Mega Drive/Genesis and Master System. The game's success spawned an entire franchise consisting of several sequels and various spin-offs. Plot The game takes place in the fictional land of Yuria, a Conan the Barbarian- style high fantasy medieval world. An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle. He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. Three warriors set out on a quest to rescue Yuria and avenge their losses at the hands of Death Adder. The first is a battle axe- wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two-handed broadsword, looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a longsword-wielding amazon, Tyris Flare, whose parents were both killed by Death Adder. The warriors rescue the inhabitants of the ransacked Turtle Village, which turns out to be situated on the shell of a giant turtle. The turtle takes the characters across the sea, and they then fly to the castle itself on the back of a giant eagle. Once at the castle they defeat Death Adder, who is wielding the Golden Axe, and save the land. In the Genesis and PC versions, and also in other ports, the characters also battle Death Adder's mentor, Death Bringer, as the true final boss. After the final battle, the warriors receive a magical golden axe that imbues the player with immortality. The arcade release of the game concludes with a fourth wall breaking end sequence with some children playing Golden Axe at an arcade. The arcade game breaks, and the characters from within the game flood into the \\"real world\\". Gameplay Progress is made through the game by fighting through Death Adder's henchmen, including men armed with clubs and maces, skeleton warriors, and knights. Players are able to attack using their weapon, jump and cast spells that hurt all enemies on the screen. The force of this magic depends on the number of \\"bars\\" of magic power currently available. The bars are filled by collecting blue \\"magic potions\\" attained by kicking little sprites who then drop the potions. These sprites appear during regular levels and during bonus stages in between levels. The male warrior Ax is able to cast earth spells. The dwarf Gilius casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris casts fire magic. Each character has a different number of maximum magic bars and varying ranges of attack. Various steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be ridden when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the Cockatrice (which also appeared in Altered Beast),Axes to Grind, The Legend of Golden Axe, Retro Gamer magazine, issue 76. Pages 38‚Äì45 which can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail. The more powerful dragon, which can either shoot fireballs or breathe fire depending on its color scheme, is found later in the game. If the players take too long to advance, skeleton swordsmen emerge from the ground, like in the film Jason and the Argonauts. In addition to the main quest, some home versions of the game included \\"duel mode\\", a survival mode type game that pitted players against increasingly powerful foes in consecutive rounds of play. This mode also featured a two-player one-on-one option. Development Lead designer and producer Makoto Uchida was fond of action movies, particularly the Conan films, and wanted to create a game influenced by them. He said that the development team for the game was small and development of the game took about a year.The Making of Golden Axe: Beast Rider. Part 1. Uchida's \\"idea was to come up with a Double Dragon that was not a Double Dragon‚Ä¶ Technos was an experienced rival who had been working on the Kunio-Kun series, so there was no way we could compete if we did the same thing as them. I had a feeling that arcade games should be competitive against the great hit console title Dragon Quest (created by Enix) and therefore studied the world of magic and swords, combined this with the gameplay of Double Dragon, and finally came up with the concept of Golden Axe.\\"\\"The Making Of Golden Axe\\" (2014-12-02). RetroGamer.net. Retrieved 2019-01-31. Uchida also cited the original Street Fighter (1987) as an influence, particularly how players could combine button movies and stick presses to perform individual attacks. Ports The Genesis version remained largely faithful to the arcade game, adding a level and a duel mode, along with a new ending. The IBM PC compatible port released in 1990 is similar to the Genesis version, but includes a 256 color VGA mode as well as support for EGA, CGA, and Hercules modes. Atari ST and Amiga ports of released in late 1990 by Virgin Software are similar to the arcade. The Amiga port is similar to the arcade game, with some palette changes and without parallax scrolling. Variations of the original game have also been released. The Master System version of the game retells the original story from the perspective of Tarik, a barbarian with resemblances to Ax Battler (much like all the other barbarian in the entire series: Kain Grinder, Stern Blade and Kain Blade). While the game is only one-player, it features all of the levels and magic powers of the arcade version. In Japan, Golden Axe was released by Telenet for the PC Engine CD-ROM in 1990 with high-quality resampled music and cut scenes. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Golden Axe on their July 1, 1989 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the year. The Spectrum version of the game went to number 2 in the UK sales charts, behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and was voted number 60 in the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time. Reviewing the game's appearance in Sega Arcade Classics for the Sega CD, Glenn Rubenstein commented that the game had become outdated in the years since its original release. In 1991, PC Format named Golden Axe one of the 50 best computer games ever, describing it as \\"deliciously animated hacking, slashing and generally whaling\\". The Xbox Live Arcade digital version of Golden Axe sold 167,935 units on the Xbox 360 console, . Legacy The Genesis version was later released in other compilations‚ÄìSega Smash Pack, Sega Genesis Collection, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection‚Äìand on the Virtual Console. A one-player only Sega CD version released as part of the Sega Classics Arcade Collection, with CD audio background music and voice-overs from the arcade version. The arcade version is also on the Virtual Console and Xbox Live Arcade. A port of the game was released on PlayStation Network on July 12, 2011 and has been available free for PlayStation Plus users. The game was released as part of the handheld TV game Arcade Legends Sega Genesis Volume 1. An enhanced remake with 3D graphics and orchestral music was released for PlayStation 2 as part of the Sega Ages line. In August 2017, the Genesis version was released for iOS and Android. It is now part of the Sega Forever service.

This process occurs when a fluid (liquid or gas) is passed up through the granular material. When a gas flow is introduced through the bottom of a bed of solid particles, it will move upwards through the bed via the empty spaces between the particles. At low gas velocities, aerodynamic drag on each particle is also low, and thus the bed remains in a fixed state. Increasing the velocity, the aerodynamic drag forces will begin to counteract the gravitational forces, causing the bed to expand in volume as the particles move away from each other. Further increasing the velocity, it will reach a critical value at which the upward drag forces will exactly equal the downward gravitational forces, causing the particles to become suspended within the fluid. At this critical value, the bed is said to be fluidized and will exhibit fluidic behavior. By further increasing gas velocity, the bulk density of the bed will continue to decrease, and its fluidization becomes more violent, until the particles no longer form a bed and are \\"conveyed\\" upwards by the gas flow. When fluidized, a bed of solid particles will behave as a fluid, like a liquid or gas. Like water in a bucket: the bed will conform to the volume of the chamber, its surface remaining perpendicular to gravity; objects with a lower density than the bed density will float on its surface, bobbing up and down if pushed downwards, while objects with a higher density sink to the bottom of the bed. The fluidic behavior allows the particles to be transported like a fluid, channeled through pipes, not requiring mechanical transport (e.g. conveyor belt). A simplified every-day-life example of a gas-solid fluidized bed would be a hot-air popcorn popper. The popcorn kernels, all being fairly uniform in size and shape, are suspended in the hot air rising from the bottom chamber. Because of the intense mixing of the particles, akin to that of a boiling liquid, this allows for a uniform temperature of the kernels throughout the chamber, minimizing the amount of burnt popcorn. After popping, the now larger popcorn particles encounter increased aerodynamic drag which pushes them out of the chamber and into a bowl. The process is also key in the formation of a sand volcano and fluid escape structures in sediments and sedimentary rocks. Applications Most of the fluidization applications use one or more of three important characteristics of fluidized beds: # Fluidized solids can be easily transferred between reactors. # The intense mixing within a fluidized bed means that its temperature is uniform. # There is excellent heat transfer between a fluidized bed and heat exchangers immersed in the bed. In the 1920s, the Winkler process was developed to gasify coal in a fluidized bed, using oxygen. It was not commercially successful. The first large scale commercial implementation, in the early 1940s, was the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process,A.W. Peters, W.H. Flank, B.H. Davis, \\"The history of petroleum cracking in the 20th century\\", ACS Symposium Series, Volume 1000, 2009, Pages 103-187 which converted heavier petroleum cuts into gasoline. Carbon-rich \\"coke\\" deposits on the catalyst particles and deactivates the catalyst in less than 1 second. The fluidized catalyst particles are shuttled between the fluidized bed reactor and a fluidized bed burner where the coke deposits are burned off, generating heat for the endothermic cracking reaction. By the 1950s, fluidized bed technology was being applied to mineral and metallurgical processes such as drying, calcining, and sulfide roasting. In the 1960s, several fluidized bed processes dramatically reduced the cost of some important monomers. Examples are the Sohio process for acrylonitrile and the oxychlorination process for vinyl chloride.Marshall, K. A. 2003. Chlorocarbons and Chlorohydrocarbons, Survey. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology These chemical reactions are highly exothermic and fluidization ensures a uniform temperature, minimizing unwanted side reactions, and efficient heat transfer to cooling tubes, ensuring a high productivity. In the late 1970s, a fluidized bed process for the synthesis of polyethylene dramatically reduced the cost of this important polymer, making its use economical in many new applications.Thomas E. Nowlin, Business and Technology of the Global Polyethylene Industry: An In-depth Look at the History, Technology, Catalysts, and Modern Commercial Manufacture of Polyethylene and Its Products, 2014, The polymerization reaction generates heat and the intense mixing associated with fluidization prevents hot spots where the polyethylene particles would melt. A similar process is used for the synthesis of polypropylene. Currently, most of the processes that are being developed for the industrial production of carbon nanotubes use a fluidized bed.Carole Baddour, Cedric Briens, 2005, \\"Carbon Nanotube Synthesis: A Review\\", IJCRE, 3, R3.International Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering Arkema uses a fluidized bed to produce 400 tonnes/year of multiwall carbon nanotubes.Carole Baddour, Cedric Briens, Serge Bodere, Didier Anglerot, Patrice Gaillard, 2008, \\"The fluidized bed jet grinding of carbon nanotubes with a nozzle/target configuration\\", Powder Technology, Volume 190, Issue 3, 25 March 2009, Pages 372-38 A new potential application of fluidization technology is chemical looping combustion, which has not yet been commercialized. One solution to reducing the potential effect of carbon dioxide generated by fuel combustion (e.g. in power stations) on global warming is carbon dioxide sequestration. Regular combustion with air produces a gas that is mostly nitrogen (as it is air's main component at about 80% by volume), which prevents economical sequestration. Chemical looping uses a metal oxide as a solid oxygen carrier. These metal oxide particles replace air (specifically oxygen in the air) in a combustion reaction with a solid, liquid or gaseous fuel in a fluidized bed, producing solid metal particles from the reduction of the metal oxides and a mixture of carbon dioxide and water vapor, the major products of any combustion reaction. The water vapor is condensed, leaving pure carbon dioxide which can be sequestered. The solid metal particles are circulated to another fluidized bed where they react with air (and again, specifically oxygen in the air), producing heat and oxidizing the metal particles to metal oxide particles that are recirculated to the fluidized bed combustor. Fluidization has many applications with the use of ion exchange particles for the purification and processing of many industrial liquid streams. Industries such as food & beverage, hydrometallurgical, water softening, catalysis, bio-based chemical etc. use ion exchange as a critical step in processing. Conventionally ion exchange has been used in a packed bed where a pre-clarified liquid passes downward through a column. Much work has been done at the University of Western Ontario in London Ontario, Canada on the use of a continuous fluidized ion exchange system, named \\"Liquid-solid circulating fluidized bed\\" (LSCFB), recently being called \\"Circulating fluidized ion exchange\\" (CFIX). This system has widespread applications extending the use of traditional ion exchange systems because it can handle feed streams with large amounts of suspended solids due to the use of fluidization.

The title, half in Latin and half in German, translates to \\"The Language of the Third Reich: A Philologist's Notebook\\"; the book is published in English translation as The Language of the Third Reich. Content Lingua Tertii Imperii studies the way that Nazi propaganda altered the German language to inculcate people with National Socialist ideas. The book was written under the form of personal notes which Klemperer wrote in his diary, especially from the rise of the Nazi regime in 1933, and even more after 1935, when Klemperer, stripped of his academic title because he was of Jewish descent, had to work in a factory. His diary became a notebook in which he noted and commented on the linguistic relativity of the German used by Nazi officials, ordinary citizens, and even fellow Jews. Klemperer wrote the book, based on his notes, in 1945‚Äì1946. LTI demonstrates changes in the German language in most of the population. In contrast, the text also emphasizes the idea that resistance to oppression begins by questioning the constant use of buzzwords. Both the book and its author unexpectedly survived the war. LTI was first published in 1947 in Germany. It underlines odd constructions of words intended to give a \\"scientific\\" or neutral aspect to otherwise heavily engaged discourses, as well as significant every-day behaviour.  Examples  Klemperer notes that much of the Nazi language involved appropriating old words and adapting their meaning, rather than making new ones. Among the examples he recorded of propagandistic language use were the following. = Recurrent words = * Artfremd (\\"Alien to the species\\") * Ewig (\\"Eternal\\") E.gr.: der ewige Jude (the eternal Jew); das ewige Deutschland (the eternal Germany) * fanatisch, Fanatismus (Fanatical / Fanaticism; used in a particularly Orwellian way: strongly positively connoted for the \\"good\\" side, and strongly negatively connoted for the \\"bad\\" side) *Instinkt (instinct) *spontan (spontaneous) = Euphemisms (Schleierw√∂rter) = * Evakuierung (\\"evacuation\\"): deportation * Holen (\\"pick up\\"): arrest * Konzentrationslager (\\"concentration camp\\"): extermination camp * Krise (\\"crisis\\"): defeat * Sonderbehandlung (\\"special treatment\\"): murder * Versch√§rfte Vernehmung (\\"intensified interrogation\\"): torture = Recurrent expressions and motives = * the war \\"imposed\\" onto a peace-loving F√ºhrer. (France and the United Kingdom did declare war on Germany, but only after Germany remilitarized the Rhineland, annexed Austria, annexed Czechoslovakia and invaded Poland.) * the \\"incommensurable hate\\" of the Jews ‚Äì an example of Orwellian ambiguity: the Jews have an \\"incommensurable hate\\" of the Third Reich (aggressive or conspiratorial), but the German people have an \\"incommensurable hate\\" of the Jews (spontaneous and legitimate). * Examples taken from Victor Klemperer's diaries: ** January 1, 1935 ‚Äì language tertii imperii: Lutze's New Year message to the SA...Our \\"fanatical will\\" twice in a non-pejorative sense.

They do not need to explain anything at all, since they are accountable to no one. Today it occurred to me: Never has the tension between human power and powerlessness, human knowledge and human stupidity been so overwhelmingly great as now. ** February 19, 1938 - ...the basic principle of the whole language of the Third Reich became apparent to me: a bad conscience; its triad: defending oneself, praising oneself, accusing - never a moment of calm testimony. ** May 23, 1938 ‚Äì The aim of education in the Third Reich and of the language of the Third Reich, is to expand the popular stratum in everyone to such an extent that the thinking stratum is suffocated. ** August 29, 1939 ‚Äì Lingua...there is no longer any talk of Bolshevists, but instead of the Russian people. ** December 31, 1940 ‚Äì language tertii imperii: In Hitler's New Year Order of the Day to the troops again the \\"victories of unparalleled dimensions,\\" again the American superlative, \\"The year of 1941 will see the accomplishment of the greatest victory in our history.\\" = Prefixes = * Gro√ü- (\\"Great\\") * Volk(s)- (\\"Volk = people, Volks = of or for the people (prefix)\\").

Volkswagen is an example of a term which has outlived the Third Reich. * Welt- (\\"world\\", as in Weltanschauung, \\"intuition/view of the world\\"): this was quite a rare, specific and cultured term before the Third Reich, but became an everyday word. It came to designate the instinctive understanding of complex geo-political problems by the Nazis, which allowed them to openly begin invasions, twist facts or violate human rights, in the name of a higher ideal and in accordance to their theory of the world. = Neologisms = * arisieren (\\"to aryanise\\") * aufnorden (\\"to nordicise up\\", make more Nordic). * entjuden (\\"to de-Jew\\").

It marks the fourth house cusp in most house systems (this is reversed in the southern hemisphere). Astrological significance The Imum Coeli is said to refer to our roots and also to the least conscious part of ourselves. It symbolizes foundations, beginnings in life, what may have been experienced through parental inheritance and homeland influences, need for security and relationships with the home and family life. It also may describe the circumstances that we will encounter at the end of our lives. Because this house was the most distant point possible from the visible part of the horoscope, Hellenistic astrologers considered the IC to be the home of the underworld, or Hades. In many cases the IC refers to a parent-- traditionally, the father. Modern astrologers may use the IC as a significator for the mother, or for both parents. There is no consensus in modern usage for which parent is best represented by the IC. The point is moot for Hellenistic astrologers who considered the fourth house the house of the father, but did not use the Imum Coeli as the cusp of the fourth house. Using the natural houses system (see cadent houses) and modern quadrant house systems in which the IC is the cusp of the fourth house, some modern astrologers see a correspondence between the fourth house and the astrological sign Cancer. However, traditional astrologers, using whole-sign houses, never made this connection. In whole-sign house systems the signs and houses have the same boundaries; hence the Imum Coeli can actually appear in the third house, the fourth house or fifth house; in cases of extreme terrestrial latitude, it may even fall in the second or sixth houses.

Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture \\"Robbers Cave State Park.\\" Retrieved September 7, 2012. History The area surrounding the present-day park has been a hunting ground for hundreds of years. Archaeological evidence suggests that the earliest people were related to the builders of the Spiro Mounds. By the 1600s, the Osage and Caddo tribes dominated the area. French hunters and explorers also visited, leaving their mark by naming some of the prominent geographic features, which are still used. ExploreSouthernHistory.com - Robbers Cave State Park, Oklahoma. Retrieved September 18, 2012 In 1850 the area of Robbers Cave was assigned to the newly established Sans Bois County, a part of the Moshulatubbee District of the Choctaw Nation.Morris, John W. Historical Atlas of Oklahoma (Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1986), plate 38. After the Civil War, this area became legendary for sheltering fugitives from the law. Some of these included Jesse James and Belle Starr. Other fugitives included the Dalton Gang, the Youngers and the Rufus Buck Gang. In 1929, Carlton Weaver, an editor and politician from Wilburton, donated 120 acres of land near Robbers Cave to the Boy Scouts of America for a campground. The warden of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary arranged for skilled prison inmates to construct camp improvements, including a kitchen and several other buildings, from rock quarried nearby. The new facility was named Camp Tom Hale, for a McAlester resident and Boy Scout supporter. The camp was adjacent to a tract of land that Weaver had leased to create a game preserve. Weaver later donated the preserve to the Oklahoma Fish and Game Commission. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was organized in 1933. Supervised by the National Park Service, the CCC built a bathhouse, cabins, trails, group camps, shelters, and roads. In 1937, CCC and the Works Progress Administration (WPA) created Lake Carlton, named for Carlton Weaver. In 1987, the park initiated the first annual Robbers Cave Fall Festival, and the Robbers Cave Bluegrass Festival began in 1988. In 1994, Oklahoma converted the bathhouse to a nature center. The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NR 96000489) in 2002.

Of the six entries that started the race, the winners were pilot Ross Smith, his brother Keith Smith as co-pilot, and mechanics James Bennett and Wally Shiers, in a modified Vickers Vimy bomber. The Competition In early 1919, the Commonwealth Government of Australia offered a prize of ¬£A10,000 for the first flight from Great Britain to Australia, under specific conditions. In May 1919, Billy Hughes, Prime Minister of Australia, and Senator George Pearce, Minister for Defence (Australia), in consultation with the Royal Aero Club, stated that valid aircrews must all be Australian nationals, the aircraft must have been constructed in the British Empire, and the journey must be completed within 720 consecutive hours (30 days) and be completed before midnight on 31 December 1920. The departure point must be either Hounslow Heath Aerodrome (for landplanes) or RNAS Calshot (for seaplanes and flying boats), with reporting points at Alexandria and Singapore, and final destination in the region of Darwin. Each flight was to take place under the competition rules of the Royal Aero Club, that would supervise the start, and control the competition generally. Contestants =Sopwith Wallaby= At 11.44 a.m. on 21 October 1919, Captain George Campbell Matthews AFC as pilot, and Sergeant Thomas D. Kay as mechanic, took off from Hounslow Heath Aerodrome in a Sopwith Wallaby (G-EAKS). Bad weather caused delays at Cologne and Vienna, then they were imprisoned as suspected Bolsheviks in Yugoslavia, with further delays due to snow at Belgrade. A cracked engine cylinder at Constantinople, and bad weather at Aleppo caused more delays. Finally, on 17 April 1920, the Wallaby crashed on landing at Grokgak, on Bali. Matthews was slightly injured.Lewis (1970)Sherwood (1999) =Vickers Vimy= The winning Vickers Vimy, 1919 Vickers entered a converted Vimy bomber (G-EAOU) (the registration being whimsically said to stand for \\"God 'elp all of us\\"), crewed by Captain Ross Macpherson Smith with his brother Lieutenant Keith Macpherson Smith as co- pilot and mechanics Sergeant W.H.

The flight distance was estimated as 17,911 kilometres (11,123 mi) and total flying time was 135 hours 55 minutes (131.8 km/h or 81.9 mph). The prize money was shared between the Smith brothers and the two mechanics. The Smith brothers each received a knighthood for this exploit, and the company presented their aircraft to the Australian government. It is now displayed at Adelaide Airport. =Alliance P.2= On 13 November 1919, Lieutenant Roger M. Douglas, MC DCM and Lieutenant J.S.L. Ross took off from Hounslow Heath in an Alliance P.2 Seabird (G-EAOX) named 'Endeavour'. It crashed in an orchard in Surbiton; Ross was killed outright, and Douglas died soon after of his injuries. =Blackburn Kangaroo= A team with a Blackburn Kangaroo (G-EAOW) had selected as navigator the Australian aviator Charles Kingsford Smith. Smith withdrew from the contest, and Captain Hubert Wilkins MC and bar took his place. On 21 November 1919, the Kangaroo took off from Hounslow Heath, piloted by Lieutenant V. Rendle with Captain Wilkins, Lieutenant D.R. Williams and Lieutenant Garnsey St. C. Potts as crew. Problems were experienced with the engines, and the plane was forced down over France. Repairs were made and the flight continued, still with engine problems. On 8 December 1919, the aircraft crash-landed at Suda Bay, Crete, ending up against the fence of a mental hospital. The crew escaped without injury. =Martinsyde Type A= On 5 December 1919, Captain Cedric E. Howell and Lieutenant George Henry Fraser left London in a Martinsyde Type A Mk.I (G-EAMR) aircraft. On 9 December, the aircraft disappeared near Corfu. The wreckage and Howell's body were found offshore, but Fraser's body was never found.

McIntosh, took off from Hounslow Heath. The aircraft completed the flight, the first by a single-engined machine, in an epic 206 days later on 2 August 1920, earning Parer the sobriquet \\"Battling Ray\\". Although outside the time limit, the crew was awarded a consolation prize of ¬£A1,000, second only to the Vimy.

Silver was extracted for use in coinage, and lead for materials for the roof of new monasteries being built in the 13th century. Mining continued sporadically over the next 600 years. By the mid nineteenth century there were three engine houses with beam engines for crushing, winding and pumping. A new phase of activity occurred in the 1960s when a new rich deposit was found which was worked on the surface and underground.

It is a platform neutral, open file format specification that is not controlled by a single vendor or group of vendors. It is an object-based file format with a data model developed by buildingSMART (formerly the International Alliance for Interoperability, IAI) to facilitate interoperability in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, and is a commonly used collaboration format in Building information modeling (BIM) based projects. The IFC model specification is open and available. It is registered by ISO and is an official International Standard ISO 16739-1:2018. Because of its focus on ease of interoperability between software platforms, the Danish government has made the use of IFC format(s) compulsory for publicly aided building projects. Also, the Finnish state-owned facility management company Senate Properties demands use of IFC compatible software and BIM in all their projects. Also the Norwegian Government, Health and Defense client organisations require use of IFC BIM in all projects as well as many municipalities, private clients, contractors and designers have integrated IFC BIM in their business. History The IFC initiative began in 1994, when Autodesk formed an industry consortium to advise the company on the development of a set of C++ classes that could support integrated application development. Twelve US companies joined the consortium. These companies included AT&T;, HOK Architects, Honeywell, Carrier, Tishman and Butler Manufacturing. Initially named the Industry Alliance for Interoperability, the Alliance opened membership to all interested parties in September, 1995 and changed its name in 1997 to the International Alliance for Interoperability. The new Alliance was reconstituted as a non-profit industry-led organization, with the goal of publishing the Industry Foundation Class (IFC) as a neutral AEC product model responding to the AEC building lifecycle. A further name change occurred in 2005, and the IFC specification is now developed and maintained by buildingSMART.

This is the most widely used IFC format, having the advantage of compact size yet readable text. * IFC-XML is an XML format defined by ISO 10303-28 (\\"STEP-XML\\"), having file extension \\".ifcXML\\". This format is suitable for interoperability with XML tools and exchanging partial building models. Due to the large size of typical building models, this format is less common in practice. * IFC-ZIP is a ZIP compressed format consisting of an embedded IFC-SPF file or IFC-XML file and having file extension \\".ifcZIP\\". IFC is in ASCII format which, while human-readable, suffers from common ASCII file issues, in that file-sizes are bloated, files must be read sequentially from start to finish, mid-file extraction is not possible, files are slow to parse, and definitions are non-hierarchical. In addition to ifcXML and ifcZIP, modernisation efforts include development of ifcOWL (based on Terse RDF triple language), ifcJSON (JavaScript Object Notation, broadly available) and ifcHDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format v5, binary). In 2020, buildingSmart had two JSON projects underway: ifcJSON v4 (a direct mapping from EXPRESS-based IFC v4) and ifcJSON v5, plus a research project experimenting with turning IFC into a binary format. Architecture IFC defines an EXPRESS based entity- relationship model consisting of several hundred entities organized into an object-based inheritance hierarchy. Examples of entities include building elements such as IfcWall, geometry such as IfcExtrudedAreaSolid, and basic constructs such as IfcCartesianPoint. At the most abstract level, IFC divides all entities into rooted and non-rooted entities. Rooted entities derive from IfcRoot and have a concept of identity (having a GUID), along with attributes for name, description, and revision control. Non-rooted entities do not have identity and instances only exist if referenced from a rooted instance directly or indirectly. IfcRoot is subdivided into three abstract concepts: object definitions, relationships, and property sets: *IfcObjectDefinition captures tangible object occurrences and types *IfcRelationship captures relationships among objects *IfcPropertyDefinition captures dynamically extensible properties about objects. =IfcObjectDefinition= IfcObjectDefinition is split into object occurrences and object types. IfcObject captures object occurrences such as a product installation having serial number and physical placement. IfcTypeObject captures type definitions (or templates) such as a product type having a particular model number and common shape. Occurrences and types are further subdivided into six fundamental concepts: actors (\\"who\\"), controls (\\"why\\"), groups (\\"what\\"), products (\\"where\\"), processes (\\"when\\"), and resources (\\"how\\"). * IfcActor represents people or organizations. * IfcControl represents rules controlling time, cost, or scope such as work orders. * IfcGroup represents collections of objects for particular purpose such as electrical circuits. * IfcProduct represents occurrences in space such as physical building elements and spatial locations. * IfcProcess represents occurrences in time such as tasks, events, and procedures. * IfcResource represents usage of something with limited availability such as materials, labor, and equipment. =IfcRelationship= IfcRelationship captures relationships among objects. There are five fundamental relationship types: composition, assignment, connectivity, association, and definition. * IfcRelDecomposes captures a whole-part relationship having exclusive containment such as subdividing a building into floors and rooms or a wall into studs and sheathing. * IfcRelAssigns captures assignment relationships where one object consumes the services of another object, such as a labor resource assigned to a task, or a task assigned to a building element. * IfcRelConnects indicates connectivity between objects such as a floor slab connected to a beam or a pipe connected to a sink. * IfcRelAssociates indicates external references for an object such an external IFC library file where an object is defined. * IfcRelDefines indicates an instance-of relationship such as a pipe segment being of a particular type. =IfcPropertyDefinition= IfcPropertyDefinition captures dynamically extensible property sets. A property set contains one or more properties which may be a single value (e.g. string, number, unit measurement), a bounded value (having minimum and maximum), an enumeration, a list of values, a table of values, or a data structure. While IFC defines several hundred property sets for specific types, custom property sets may be defined by application vendors or end users. * IfcPropertySet represents a set of properties attached to an object occurrence or object type. * IfcPropertySetTemplate [IFC2x4] captures definitions of properties and their data types. =Products= IfcProduct is the base class for all physical objects and is subdivided into spatial elements, physical elements, structural analysis items, and other concepts. Products may have associated materials, shape representations, and placement in space. Spatial elements include IfcSite, IfcBuilding, IfcBuildingStorey, and IfcSpace. Physical building elements include IfcWall, IfcBeam, IfcDoor, IfcWindow, IfcStair, etc. Distribution elements (HVAC, electrical, plumbing) have a concept of ports where elements may have specific connections for various services, and connected together using cables, pipes, or ducts to form a system. Various connectivity relationships are used for building elements such as walls having openings filled by doors or windows. Materials may be defined for products as a whole, or as layers, profiles, or constituents for specified parts. * IfcMaterial indicates a specific material, with optional properties (e.g. mechanical, thermal) and styles (e.g. colors, textures). * IfcMaterialLayerSet captures a list of layers, each indicating a material of a specified thickness. * IfcMaterialProfileSet [IFC2x4] captures a set of profiles, each indicating a material of a specified cross-section. * IfcMaterialConstituentSet [IFC2x4] captures a set of constituents, each indicating a material used at a named shape aspect. Representations may be defined for explicit 3D shape, and optionally as parametric constraints. Each representation is identified by IfcShapeRepresentation with a well-known name. * 'Body' indicates a 3D shape which may be represented by B-rep, NURBS, Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG), or swept profiles. It may be defined directly or derived by applying material definitions to other representations. * 'Axis' indicates a path for linear elements (e.g. wall, beam, pipe) for which material profiles or layers are aligned. * 'FootPrint' indicates a boundary for planar elements (e.g. slab, staircase) for which material layers are bounded. * 'Profile' indicates a side profile for opening elements (e.g. door, window) for which material constituents are bounded. * 'SurveyPoints' indicates a set of points for surface elements (e.g. site) for describing contours. Placement may indicate position, vertical angle, and horizontal angle. * IfcLocalPlacement indicates placement relative to an enclosing element hierarchy. * IfcGridPlacement indicates placement relative to a grid with user-defined axes. Quantities may be defined for take-off purposes such as Gross Area, Gross Volume, Gross Weight, Net Weight, etc. IFC defines various quantities specific to each element type and the method of calculation according to geometry and relationships. =Processes= IfcProcess is the base class for processes and is subdivided into tasks, events, and procedures. Processes may have durations and be scheduled to occur at specific time periods. Processes may be sequenced such that a successor task may start after a predecessor task finishes, following the Critical Path Method. Processes may be nested into sub-processes for summary roll-up. Processes may be assigned to products indicating the output produced by the work performed. =Resources= IfcResource is the base class for resources and is subdivided into materials, labor, equipment, subcontracts, crews, and more. Resources may have various costs and calendars of availability. Resources may be nested into sub- resources for granular allocation. Resources may be assigned to processes indicating tasks performed on behalf of a resource. =Contexts= IfcProject encapsulates an overall project and indicates the project name, description, default units, currency, coordinate system, and other contextual information. A valid IFC file must always include exactly one IfcProject instance, from which all other objects relate directly or indirectly. A project may include multiple buildings, multiple participants, and/or multiple phases according to the particular use. In addition to project-specific information, an IfcProject may also reference external projects from which shared definitions may be imported such as product types. Each external project is encapsulated using IfcProjectLibrary [IFC2x4] along with IfcRelAssociatesLibrary and IfcLibraryInformation to identify the particular revision of the imported project library. Projects support revision control where any IfcRoot-based entity has a unique identifier and may be marked as added, modified, deleted, or having no change. Such capability allows multiple IFC files to be merged deterministically, ensuring data integrity without human intervention.

It was part of the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and is part of the current government of Haider al-Abadi since 2014. Osama Tawfiq al-Tikriti succeeded Vice-President Tariq al-Hashimi as the party's secretary- general on 24 May 2009, who was succeeded in July 2011 by Ayad al-Samarrai. The IIP evolved out of the Muslim Brotherhood movement, and was banned from 1961 during Iraqi nationalist rule, something which continued throughout the reign of the Pan-Arab Ba'ath Party right up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Like the Muslim Brotherhood, the IIP's religious rather than ethno-political ideology made the party systematically incompatible under the Iraqi governments between 1961 and 2003.iraqi islamic party (iip) , Niqash, 7 November 2005, accessed on 24 July 2010 During the 1970s, the IIP began operating in exile in Great Britain and published a newspaper called Dar as- Salam.

It joined the Iraqi Interim Government where it had one minister, Hajim al-Hassani. On 9 November 2004, the IIP withdrew from the government in protest over Operation Phantom Fury, an offensive at Fallujah led by U.S. forces. Hassani chose to stay in the government and quit the party, later joining The Iraqis list. Government participation The party initially supported the general elections of 30 January 2005 but pulled out of the national election one month before the vote saying violence made a fair election impossible. The party did participate in some elections for governorate level posts on the same day (see for instance 2005 Ninawa governorate election and 2005 Al-Anbar governorate council election). The IIP led a large-scale public campaign urging Iraqis (especially the Sunnis) to vote against the constitutional referendum in 2005. Two days before the referendum took place, the IIP announced its support for a \\"yes\\" vote, following a compromise with the members of the Iraqi Transitional Government whereby the newly elected Iraqi National Assembly would consider amendments to the constitution in 2006. In the December 2005 election, the IIP ran as part of the Iraqi Accord Front coalition, which won 44 seats, the most for any Sunni Arab coalition. The leader of Al-Qaida in Iraq, Abu Mu'sab al-Zarqawi, condemned the IIP for their participation in the general election.What extremists are saying - U.S. Central Command, 21 February 2006 The party's platform for the elections included demanding a timetable for the withdrawal of the Multinational force in Iraq, opposition to federalism in Iraq, opposition to De-Ba'athification and promotion of Islamic values. Following the elections in 2006, the IAF joined the United Iraqi Alliance-led government of Nouri al-Maliki. In 2012, the party formed a coalition several Sunni Islamists parties called Muttahidoon. Relationship with US The party has often criticized the US military presence in Iraq. In October 2008, following a US-backed raid that resulted in the death of a man the IIP said was a senior party official, the party said in a statement that it was suspending all contact with US civilian and military officials.Iraq's main Sunni party suspends contacts with USAP via Yahoo, 28 October 2008 A US military drone crashed into the party's offices in Mosul in 2009.

Representing Jamaica, Miller won the silver medal in the 100 meters in the 1968 Summer Olympics and the bronze in the 1972 Summer Olympics, also in the 100. He and Inger are the first father-daughter to win Olympic track and field medals. He was her coach prior to her winning gold in the 1996 Summer Olympics. Both ran for the University of Southern California, where Miller earned a degree in psychology and graduated from the dental school. He had been a dentist in Pasadena for 30 years. While at USC, Miller anchored the still standing World Record 4x110 yard relay at the NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championships, held at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. The Imperial distance became defunct as the IAAF now only recognizes metric races (except the one Mile run), so the event is rarely run and not part of elite competition. The record was also complicated because of Miller's Jamaican citizenship, the makeup of the team was not entirely from one country. Miller took the baton from O.J. Simpson. Also on the team was future NFL star Earl McCullouch.

The set was finally broken up, with most of it sold off in 1885 by the Third French Republic. The surviving French Crown Jewels, principally a set of historic crowns, diadems and parures, are mainly on display in the Galerie d'Apollon of the Louvre, France's premier museum and former royal palace, together with the Regent Diamond, the Sancy Diamond and the C√¥te-de-Bretagne red spinel, carved into the form of a dragon.

Dauphin, Louis Antoine, worn at the coronation of Charles X in 1825. The Crown jewels comprise the instruments of the coronation, called the Regalia, and the jewels of the ruling family. Since Pepin the Short in 752, the accession of the King of France was legitimated by a coronation ceremony called a sacre, since the emphasis was on the unction with the chrism of the Holy Ampulla, performed for the first time at Notre-Dame de Reims in 816 for Louis the Pious, then with the Crown of Charlemagne. From 888 to 922, then 1027, all monarchs were crowned until the French revolution, in the Notre-Dame de Reims cathedral (apart from Louis VI and Henry IV, who were crowned in Orl√©ans and Chartres). After the revolution, only Emperor Napoleon I, Empress Josephine and King Charles X were crowned. Though not always used, a set of expensive crown jewels did exist and was augmented by various monarchs. The Crown Jewels or Diamants de la Couronne de France, consisting of gemstones and jewellery, List of the surviving main Crown jewels became unalienable by decision of Francis I on June 15, 1530. The C√¥te-de-Bretagne red spinel was then among the 8 main jewels. They suffered important loss by the Catholic League in 1590 but were reconstituted by Henry IV and greatly enhanced by Louis XIV, notably with the gift of the 18 Mazarin diamonds and the purchase of the 'Royal French Blue' and 'Ruspoli' sapphire, later followed in 1717 with the Regent Diamond. Under Louis XV, they were kept in the Garde Meuble de la Couronne (Royal Treasury) in one of the pavilions of the Place de la Concorde, where they suffered a theft in 1792 and a sale in 1795 after their partial recovery. In 1814, Napoleon I had restored the crown jewels to 65,072 stones and pearls, not including the personal jewels of both Empress Josephine and Empress Marie-Louise. Enhanced during the Restoration and again during the Second Empire, they counted 77,662 stones and pearls, comprising 51,403 brilliant cut diamonds, 21,119 rose cut diamonds, 2962 pearls, 507 rubies, 136 sapphires, 250 emeralds, 528 turquoises, 22 opals, 235 amethysts and 500 other stones, when they were sold in 1885 by the Third Republic. Nevertheless, as in 1793, an important set of stones and pearls was sent to the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle and some of the most important jewels were bought back since 1953, which makes the collection still number more than 11,000 stones and pearls.

Some few pieces of the treasure, considered to present an artistic value, were preserved and sent to the Louvre, which sold 9 of them in 1798, the National Library, the Natural History Museum, and the archbishops of Rouen (5 items) and Paris. The others, were sold in 1793 like the chalice and two cruets of Saint Denis, or dismantled and melted down in April 1794, like the Crown of Charlemagne and the ones of Saint Louis Crown of Saint Louis in the treasure of Saint Denis in 1706, from Dom Michel F√©libien, Histoire de L'Abbaye Royale de Saint-Denys en France.

The liturgical instruments kept in Reims suffered the same policy. The Regalia were restored or recreated for the coronation of Napoleon I, which at their turn suffered again partial destruction in 1819, and finally completed for the coronation of Charles X in 1825.

Crown of Louis XV, 1722, Louvre The king had the Regent Diamond set in the lower part of the fleur-de-lis in the front of his crown, while eight of the famous Mazarin diamonds that the cardinal had bequeathed to the French Crown are set in the other seven fleur-de-lis and in the circlet of the crown. Diamonds and colored gemstones are set between two rows of pearls on the circlet and are also set into the four arches that rise behind the fleur-de- lis and the eight ornamental points between the fleur-de-lis. At the junction of these four arches is a small pedestal surrounded by two rows of small diamonds on either side of a row of small pearls. Eight larger diamonds set between this pedestal and the arches give the effect of a sunburst when the crown is viewed from above. On the pedestal rises a double fleur-de-lis formed of nine large diamonds, including the Sancy Diamond which forms the central upper petal of this double fleur-de-lis. The gold brocade cap which lines the crown is also ornamented with large diamonds. Since the Middle Ages, and previous to the making of this crown, the crowns of French kings were adorned with gemstones like on the crown of Charlemagne or the crown of Saint Louis, sometimes called the Sainte Couronne. Crown of Saint Louis. But some of the most valuable precious stones could be removed from them, since it was traditional for a French king to bequeath his crown to the treasury of the Abbey, now Basilica of St Denis, on their deaths. This crown was also bequeathed to Saint Denis on the death of Louis XV, but not before the diamonds had been replaced with crystals, and it is on display presently in the Louvre, similarly set with crystals. =Crown of Napoleon I= The crown of Napoleon was made by the jeweller Martin-Guillaume Biennais with antique cameos for the coronation of the Emperor in 1804. His gilded crown of laurels Napoleon I in coronation costume, Fran√ßois G√©rard, 1805, Louvre was destroyed in 1819 by Louis XVIII with the one of Empress Josephine, the orb and the eagle sceptre.

The sword used during the coronation of the kings of France is displayed at the Louvre museum with its 13th-century scabbard, King's sword scabbard, 13th century, Louvre apart from the crown jewels. In the first part of the celebration, the king received the insignia of knighthood, consisting of spurs and the sword. Throughout the rest of the ceremony, the sword was entrusted to the \\"Conn√©table\\", who held it with the blade pointing upwards. The treasury of Saint-Denis possessed several medieval swords including the one of Saint Louis. According to legend the coronation sword is \\"Joyeuse\\", Charlemagne's sword. Coronation sword, 10th to 13th centuries, Louvre Its unusual build and ornamentation makes it difficult to date, but the parts probably date back from the 10th to 13th centuries. Some believe it might be much older, even manufactured before Charlemagne's reign. The coronation swords of Napoleon I and Charles X also were preserved in the Louvre museum, although the first was transferred to the Palace of Fontainebleau with most of the preserved liturgical instruments and robes of the imperial ceremony and the latter stolen in 1976. =Coronation spurs= Some elements of the 12th to 16th centuries spurs were partially replaced for the coronation of Napoleon I. Coronation spurs, 12th to 16th centuries and 1804, Louvre =Sceptre of Charles V= Statuette of Charlemagne on the sceptre of Charles V, 14th c., Louvre. One of the few surviving pieces of the medieval French crown jewels is the sceptre that Charles V had made for the future coronation of his son, Charles VI, currently on display in the Louvre. Sceptre of Charles V, 14th century, Louvre It is over five feet long, and at the top is a lily supporting a small statuette of Charlemagne. Sceptre of Charles V This evocation of Charlemagne may also explain why this sceptre was included in the imperial regalia of Napoleon I.:File:Ingres, Napoleon on his Imperial throne.jpg The sceptre of Dagobert I was stolen in 1795 during the Revolution. =Main de Justice (Hand of Justice)= The recreated \\"Hand of Justice\\", Louvre. A typically French type of sceptre is the Main de Justice (Hand of Justice), which has as its finial an ivory Hand of God in a blessing gesture. Hand of Justice, 1804 and medieval, Louvre Only the ivory finial itself appears to be medieval and probably comes from one of the three former Hands of Justice in the treasure of Saint Denis, perhaps the one of Saint Louis. The present golden rod which it terminates was probably made for either the coronation of Napoleon I or that of Charles X. The addition of cameos and other medieval gemstones, like the 12th-century ring of Saint Denis which surrounds the junction of the finial and the replaced rod, represents a deliberate 19th-century anachronism. Ring of Saint Denis, 12th century, Louvre Another sceptre, the Baton of Guillaume de Roquemont, Baton of Guillaume de Roquemont, 14th century, Louvre and the ring of Saint Louis Ring of Saint Louis, 14th century, Louvre are at the Louvre. =Brooch of Saint Louis= The collection keeps as well the 14th-century brooch or fermail said of Saint Louis, a large diamond shaped fibula bearing a fleur-de-lis in precious stones, which was used to hold the coronation's robe. Brooch (fermail) of Saint Louis, 14th century, Louvre =Serpentine paten= Paten of serpentine with inlaid gold fish, 1st century BCE or CE, with 9th-century mounts, Louvre. The serpentine paten said to be of Abbot Suger of the 1st century BC or AD, associated with the Cup of the Ptolemies, was used at the coronation of queens and keeps its gem-studded gold Carolingian mountings of Charles the Bald. Serpentine paten, 1st century BC or AD and 9th century, Louvre =Famous diamonds= The Sancy Diamond The Regent Diamond Among the most famous diamonds The Diamants de la Couronne preserved in the collection and now kept in the Apollo Gallery of the Louvre are the Sancy Diamond, which once had been part of the pre-Commonwealth Crown Jewels of England, the Hortensia pink diamond cut in 1678 for Louis XIV and above all the Regent Diamond. Regent Diamond, Louvre The treatment of the Regent Diamond epitomised the attitude of the French Royal Family to the Crown Jewels.

Theft of the crown jewels during the Revolution Tavernier's original sketch of the diamond which became the Royal French Blue. Gouache of the great Golden Fleece [including the \\"Royal French Blue\\"] of king Louis XV of France, version 1 of 2008, painted by Pascal Monney (ca. 16 √ó 6 cm) The Hope Diamond, which was cut from the Royal French Blue, part of the French Crown Jewels stolen in 1792. The Crown Jewels were stolen in 1792 when the Garde Meuble (Royal Treasury) was stormed by rioters. Most, though not all, of the Crown Jewels were recovered eventually. Sancy Diamond was found in Russia at Vasily Rudanovsky collection. The Royal French Blue is believed to have been recut, and it is now known as the Hope Diamond. The Hope is famously alleged to have been surrounded by bad luck. Marie Antoinette who supposedly wore it was beheaded (in fact, it was actually worn by her husband, Louis XVI, although he too was beheaded). Other owners and their families experienced suicides, marriage break-ups, bankruptcy, deaths in car crashes, falls off cliffs, revolutions, mental breakdowns, and deaths through drug overdoses. It was even tangentially associated with the case of the murdered Lindbergh baby, when its then owner, silver heiress Evalyn Walsh McLean, pawned it to raise money that she ended up paying to a con-man unconnected with the actual kidnapping. Most modern historians view the tales of a curse on the Hope to be spurious; the first mention of such tales is documented to 1908. Pierre Cartier, the Parisian jeweler, is widely credited with publicizing the stories of a curse on the diamond in hopes of increasing its saleability. Since 1958, it has been in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., where it is the single most-viewed object in the Smithsonian's collection. The Crown Jewels were augmented by jewels added by Napoleon I and Napoleon III. Last coronation The last French coronation occurred in 1825 when King Charles X was crowned at Reims. The scale of the coronation was seen by critics to indicate a return to the absolutism of the ancien regime that had been ended by the Revolution of 1789. Some historians suggest that the very grandeur of the ceremony marked the beginning of the end for the Bourbon monarchy, with Charles's image as an old style monarch falling out of favour with the French public, who had much preferred the low-key monarchy of his brother, Louis XVIII. Louis Philippe of France, the last French king, was not crowned, and neither was Napoleon III, the last Emperor. Napoleon III's consort, Eug√©nie de Montijo, did have a crown made for her, though it was never used in an official coronation. Break-up and sale of the French crown jewels Sapphire set of Queen Marie Am√©lie bought back by the Louvre in 1985. During the late 18th and 19th centuries the jewels survived the First French Republic, the Directorate, the First Empire, the Restoration, the July Monarchy, the Second French Republic and the Second Empire. However, the decision of Henri, Comte de Chambord not to accept the French Crown in the early 1870s ended not just the prospect of a royal restoration. It also led to the break-up and partial sale of the Crown Jewels. The Brazilian beauty Aim√©e de Heeren,Aim√©e de Heeren, later owner of the private jewelry of Empress Eugenie WW2 secret service agent for President Get√∫lio Vargas was known for being the largest private owner of the French Crown jewels, along with other important jewelry. The jewels were presents from Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster who bought whatever he could find between the years 1939 and 1953. In 1875, the Third French Republic came into being with the passage of a series of Constitutional Laws. The interim presidency was replaced by a full \\"President of the Republic\\". While few expected a royal restoration, certainly after the failure of the Seize Mai attempted royalist coup by the Marshal Patrice de Mac-Mahon, sitting President of the French Republic, the continuing agitation of extreme right-wing royalists, and the fear of a royalist coup d'√©tat, led radical deputies to propose the sale of the Crown Jewels, in the hope that their dispersal would undermine the royalist cause: \\"Without a crown, no need for a king\\" in the words of one member of the National Assembly. This controversial decision was implemented. All the jewels from the Crown Jewels were removed and sold in 1887, as were many of the crowns, diadems, rings and other items. Only a few of the crowns were kept for historic reasons, but with their original diamonds and gems replaced by colored glass. Some historic or unusual gems went to French museums, including the Regent Diamond, the Hortensia diamond, and the corsage brooch containing some of the 'Mazarin diamonds', all of which now reside in the Louvre; and the 'Ruspoli' sapphire, which is now in the French Natural History Museum (curators took advantage of its unusual rhombohedral faceted shape and asked for it to be exempted from the sale, falsely claiming that it was a natural, uncut crystal).

It is usually seen in the terminal stages of acute head injury and may indicate imminent brain herniation. It can also be seen after the intravenous administration of epinephrine and similar drugs. It was first described in detail by American neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing in 1901.  Definition  Defect of the blood‚Äìbrain barrier after stroke shown in T1-weighted MRI images. Left image without, right image with contrast medium administration showing evidence of brain ischemia The Cushing reflex classically presents as an increase in systolic and pulse pressure, reduction of the heart rate (bradycardia), and irregular respiration. It is caused by increased pressure inside the skull. These symptoms can be indicative of insufficient blood flow to the brain (ischemia) as well as compression of arterioles. In response to rising intracranial pressure (ICP), respiratory cycles change in regularity and rate. Different patterns indicate a different location of the brain where the injury occurred. The increase in ventilation is exhibited as an increase in rate rather than depth of ventilation, so the Cushing reflex is often associated with slow, irregular breathing. As a result of the now defective regulation of heart rate and blood pressure, the physiologic response is decreased blood flow peripherally, which can present as Mayer waves. These are simply pathologic waves seen in HR tracings (i.e., arterial lines, electrocardiograph (ECG, etc.), which reflect decreased intravascular blood flow. This decreased flow often causes a reflexive HTN, or hypertension (increase in blood pressure) despite the actual decrease in intravascular volume. Differential diagnosis Subarachnoid hemorrhage as shown on a CT scan. It is denoted by the arrow. This type of injury may result in damage to the brainstem, which could initiate or worsen the symptoms of the Cushing reflex Whenever a Cushing reflex occurs, there is a high probability of death in seconds to minutes. As a result, a Cushing reflex indicates a need for immediate care. Since its presence is a good detector of high ICP, it is often useful in the medical field, particularly during surgery. During any neurosurgery being performed on the brain, there is always a likelihood that raised intracranial pressure may occur. Early recognition of this is crucial to the well being of the patient. Although direct measurement of ICP is possible, it is not always accurate. In the past, physicians and nurses have relied on hemodynamic changes or bradycardia, the late phase of the reflex, to identify the ICP increase. Once the initial stage of the Cushing reflex (bradycardia combined with hypertension) was discovered, it offered a much more reliable and swift warning sign of high ICP. It was found that hypertension and bradycardia occurred 93% of the time when cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) dropped below 15 mmHg due to raised ICP. Also, the Cushing reflex is known to arise only from acute prolonged raises in ICP. Thus, it can be used as a tool by physicians to differentiate acute and chronic rises in ICP. It has also been reported that the presence of a Cushing reflex due to an ICP increase could allow one to conclude that ischemia has occurred in the posterior cranial fossa. Finally, the Cushing reflex may be one of many ways to identify if a patient has rejected a transplanted organ. Aside from the innate autoimmune response, ischemia in the cranial region has been detected with a transplanted organ that is being rejected. As such, the presence of a Cushing reflex due to ICP can indicate that ischemia may be occurring due to foreign organ rejection. As first postulated by Harvey Cushing, raised intracranial pressure is the primary cause of the Cushing reflex. Furthermore, continued moderate increases in cranial pressure allows for the Cushing reflex to occur. In contrast, rapid and dramatic pressure rises do not allow for the mechanism of the reflex to sufficiently take place. Elevated intracranial pressure can result from numerous pathways of brain impairment, including: subarachnoid hemorrhages, ischemia, meningitis, trauma, including concussions, hypoxia, tumors, and stroke. In one study, it was confirmed that raised ICP due to subarachnoid hemorrhaging causes mechanical distortion of the brainstem, specifically the medulla. Due to the mechanism of the Cushing reflex, brainstem distortion is then swiftly followed by sympathetic nervous system over activity. In addition, during typical neurosurgical procedures on patients, especially those involving neuroendoscopic techniques, frequent washing of the ventricles have been known to cause high intracranial pressure. The Cushing reflex can also result from low CPP, specifically below 15 mmHg. CPP normally falls between 70-90 mmHg in an adult human, and 60-90 mmHg in children. Brain plateau wave changes are also associated with the Cushing reflex. These waves are characterized by acute rises of the ICP, and are accompanied by a decrease of the cerebral perfusion pressure. It has been found that if a Cushing reflex occurs, brain plateau wave changes can be erased due to disappearance of high ICP. Mechanism The Cushing reflex is complex and seemingly paradoxical. The reflex begins when some event causes increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Since cerebrospinal fluid is located in an area surrounded by the skull, increased ICP consequently increases the pressure in the fluid itself. The pressure in the cerebral spinal fluid eventually rises to the point that it meets and gradually exceeds the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). When the ICP exceeds the MAP, arterioles located in the brain's cerebrum become compressed. Compression then results in diminished blood supply to the brain, a condition known as cerebral ischemia. During the increase in ICP, both the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system are activated. In the first stage of the reflex, sympathetic nervous system stimulation is much greater than parasympathetic stimulation. The sympathetic response activates alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, causing constriction of the body's arteries. This constriction raises the total resistance of blood flow, elevating blood pressure to high levels, which is known as hypertension. The body's induced hypertension is an attempt to restore blood flow to the ischemic brain. The sympathetic stimulation also increases the rate of heart contractions and cardiac output. Increased heart rate is also known as tachycardia. This combined with hypertension is the first stage of the Cushing reflex. Meanwhile, baroreceptors in the aortic arch detect the increase in blood pressure and trigger a parasympathetic response via the vagus nerve. This induces bradycardia, or slowed heart rate, and signifies the second stage of the reflex. Bradycardia may also be caused by increased ICP due to direct mechanical distortion of the vagus nerve and subsequent parasympathetic response. Furthermore, this reflexive increase in parasympathetic activity is thought to contribute to the formation of Cushing ulcers in the stomach, due to uncontrolled activation of the parietal cells. The blood pressure can be expected to remain higher than the pressure of the raised cerebral spinal fluid to continue to allow blood to flow to the brain. The pressure rises to the point where it overcomes the resisting pressure of the compressed artery, and blood is allowed through, providing oxygen to the hypoxic area of the brain. If the increase in blood pressure is not sufficient to compensate for the compression on the artery, infarction occurs. Raised ICP, tachycardia, or some other endogenous stimulus can result in distortion and/or increased pressure on the brainstem. Since the brainstem controls involuntary breathing, changes in its homeostasis often results in irregular respiratory pattern and/or apnea. This is the third and final stage of the reflex. The role of the central chemoreceptors in the Cushing reflex is unclear. In most normal pressure responses the chemoreceptors and baroreceptors work together to increase or decrease blood pressure. In the Cushing reflex, the central chemoreceptors are likely involved in the detection of ischemia, contributing to the sympathetic surge and hypertension in the first phase of the reflex, and work in opposition to the baroreceptors, contributing to the combined high sympathetic and parasympathetic activation. =Function= Raised intracranial pressure can ultimately result in the shifting or crushing of brain tissue, which is detrimental to the physiological well-being of patients. As a result, the Cushing reflex is a last-ditch effort by the body to maintain homeostasis in the brain. It is widely accepted that the Cushing reflex acts as a baroreflex, or homeostatic mechanism for the maintenance of blood pressure, in the cranial region. Specifically, the reflex mechanism can maintain normal cerebral blood flow and pressure under stressful situations such as ischemia or subarachnoid hemorrhages. A case report of a patient who underwent a spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage demonstrated that the Cushing reflex played a part in maintaining cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and cerebral blood flow. Eventually, the ICP drops to a level range where a state of induced hypertension in the form of the Cushing reflex is no longer required. The Cushing reflex was then aborted, and CPP was maintained. It has also been shown that an increase in mean arterial pressure due to hypertension, characteristic of the reflex, can cause the normalization of CPP. This effect is protective, especially during increased intracranial pressure, which creates a drop in CPP. Cushing's triad Cushing's triad is a clinical triad variably defined as having: *Irregular, decreased respirations (caused by impaired brainstem function) *Bradycardia *Systolic hypertension (widening pulse pressure) History Harvey Cushing, Doris Ulmann 1920s Cushing's reflex is named after Harvey Williams Cushing (1869‚Äì1939), an American neurosurgeon. Cushing began his research in Bern, Switzerland studying abroad with Emil Theodor Kocher. A month into his trip, Cushing received a formal proposition from Emil Theodor Kocher to begin testing how compression of the brain affected blood vessels. Cushing also enlisted the aid of Hugo Kronecker, a known blood pressure researcher. Utilizing Kroenecker's assistance and resources, Cushing began his research. Cushing left Bern in 1901 to work in Turin, Italy with Angelo Mosso, a previous student of Kroenecker. He continued to work on the same research project, while also simultaneously improving his methods of recording coincidence of blood pressure and ICP. In June 1901 Cushing published his first paper through Johns Hopkins Hospital Bulletin entitled \\"Concerning a definite regulatory mechanism of the vasomotor centre which controls blood pressure during cerebral compression\\". Between 1901 and 1903, Cushing published five papers pertaining to his research on the vasopressor response. These papers were published in German and English, and one was authored by Emil Theodor Kocher. =Experimental setup and results= Cushing began experimenting once he obtained approval from Kocher. His experimental setup was a modified version of Leonard Hill's model to similarly test the effects of brain pressure on sinus pressure, cerebrospinal fluid pressure, arterial and venous blood pressure. Like Hill, Cushing used dogs for his experiments. To begin, Cushing monitored the caliber and color of cortical vessels by fitting a glass window into the skull of the dog. Intracranial pressure was raised by filling an intracranial, soft, rubber bag with mercury. Cushing recorded the intracranial pressure along with blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate simultaneously. This three part effect is commonly referred to as Cushing's triad. In later experiments performed by Mosso, intracranial pressure was induced by injecting physiological saline into the subarachnoid space rather than increasing mercury content of an intracranial bag. This research clearly displayed the cause and effect relationship between intracranial pressure and cerebral compression. Cushing noted this relationship in his subsequent publications. He also noted that there must exist a specific regulatory mechanism that increased blood pressure to a high enough point such that it did not create anemic conditions. Cushing's publications contain his observations and no statistical analysis. The sample size of the experiment is also not known. =Other researchers= Several notable figures in the medical field, including Ernst von Bergmann, Henri Duret, Friedrich Jolly, and others experimented with intracranial pressure similarly to Cushing. Some of these researchers published similar findings concerning the relationship of intracranial pressure to arterial blood pressure before Cushing had begun experimenting. Cushing studied this relationship more carefully and offered an improved explanation of the relationship. Some controversy concerning plagiarism does surround some of Cushing's research. Bernhard Naunyn, a German pathologist and contemporary of Cushing, made remarks claiming that Cushing neither cited him in Cushing's research nor expanded on any of the results that he had found in his original experiments. Research directions Although a lot of progress has been made since 1901 when Harvey Cushing first expanded knowledge of what is now known as the Cushing reflex, there are still many aspects of the research that remain to be seen. The exact pathogenesis of the disease remains undetermined. The possibility that intracranial pressure (ICP) may not be the sole cause of the Cushing reflex per se came from an occurrence of Cushing blood pressure response occurring before increased ICP. Some research observed symptoms of Cushing reflex, without the usual increased ICP and medullary anemia, suggesting other causes that still require research. Axial brain stem distortion could be the pathogenesis of Cushing reflex. The nature of receptors mediating the Cushing response is also unknown. Some research suggests the existence of intracranial baroreceptors to trigger specific Cushing baroreceptor reflex. Experiments by Schmidt and his fellow researchers showed that the Cushing reflex is directed by autonomic nervous system, since its physiological change has to do with the balance of the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system. However, the specific relation between the autonomic nervous system response and the Cushing reflex and its symptoms has yet to be identified. It has been determined that rate of respiration is affected by the Cushing reflex, though the respiratory changes induced are still an area that needs more research. Some researchers have reported apnea, while others have reported increased respiratory rates. Other researchers have found that increases in respiratory rate follow ICP decreases, while others say it is a response to ICP increase. One must also take into account the use of anesthetics in early experimentation. Research was initially performed on animals or patients under anesthesia. The anesthesia used in experiments have led to respiratory depression, which might have had effect on the results. Early experiments also put animal subjects under artificial ventilation, only allowing for limited conclusions about respiration in the Cushing reflex. The use of anesthetics proposes ideas for future research, since the creation of the Cushing response has been difficult to create under basal conditions or without anesthesia. Some researchers have also suggested a long-term effect of the Cushing reflex. Thus far it has only been observed as an immediate acute response, but there has been some evidence to suggest that its effects could be prolonged, such as a long-term raise in blood pressure. Heightened sensitivity of neurological response systems leading to arterial hypertension is also possible, but has not been examined. Although the Cushing reflex was primarily identified as a physiological response when blood flow has almost ceased, its activity has also been seen in fetal life. This activity has not been thoroughly investigated, so there is a need for more research in this area. The underlying mechanisms of the reflex on a cellular level are yet to be discovered, and will likely be the next area of research if scientists and or doctors chose to do so.
