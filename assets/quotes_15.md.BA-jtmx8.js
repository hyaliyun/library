The name also refers to the area on or adjacent to the hill. It is surrounded by Ngau Chi Wan, San Po Kong, Wong Tai Sin and Tsz Wan Shan. Its northeast is limited by the ridge. It is principally a residential district. History The village settlements in the area, Sheung Yuen Leng () and Ha Yuen Leng (), predated British colonization, and may have been established as early as the early eighteenth century. There were squatter dwellings (shanties) up and down the hill that were demolished after years of effort by the Hong Kong Government. The squatter population peaked at around 50,000 people. Parts of the squatter settlement were demolished over the years, including for expansion of the Kai Tak Airport during the Japanese occupation, construction of the Mass Transit Railway, Lung Cheung Road, and the Tate's Cairn Tunnel. Due to the dramatic shortage of public housing available for resettlement, the final sections were only demolished in 2001. Contrary to its name, the area does not contain any diamond deposits. There are a number of theories as to why the misnomer came about, but the most accepted version states that the English name for this area was a simple mistranslation, for in Cantonese, the word \\"\\" can mean either \\"diamonds\\" or \\"to drill for rocks\\". In this case, the area was known as a stone quarry for many years before urban development took place. Due to that, the English name only became a euphemism. There are other theories as to why the area became known as \\"Diamond Hill\\", such as the crystals contained within the rocks mined from the area have a diamond-like luminance, or that the hill resembles the shape of a diamond. Location Diamond Hill Urn Cemetery is high in the hill. Diamond Hill MTR Station is located near Plaza Hollywood, a nearby shopping centre was so named to associate it with the former movie studio nearby, where many films were produced after World War II. It most notably launched the career of international star, Bruce Lee. Sam Hui and brothers lived around the area, too. Tate's Cairn Tunnel has its Kowloon entrance in Diamond Hill.

He played Lonnie, a banjo-playing teenager in north Georgia, who played the noted \\"Dueling Banjos\\" with Drew Ballinger (Ronny Cox). The film was critically acclaimed and received nominations for awards in several categories. Early life Redden was born in Rabun County, Georgia, on October 13, 1956. Career At the age of fifteen, he was discovered by Lynn Stalmaster, who was scouting for the movie Deliverance. Stalmaster recommended Redden to the director John Boorman, though Redden was not an albino child as Boorman had requested, and Redden was cast. He portrayed a banjo-playing \\"local\\" during the film's famous \\"dueling banjos\\" scene. Boorman felt that Redden's skinny frame, large head, and almond-shaped eyes made him the natural choice to play the part of an \\"inbred from the back woods.\\" Because Redden could not play a banjo, he wore a special shirt which allowed a real banjo player to hide behind him for the scene, which was shot with carefully chosen camera angles that would conceal the player, whose arms were slipped around Redden's waist to play the tune.Potempa, Philip (October 19, 2008). \\"Burt Reynolds and 'Deliverance' boy reunited \\". The Times of Northwest Indiana. The hidden banjo player was shown playing \\"clawhammer\\" style, while the soundtrack had the banjo music as three finger \\"Earl Scruggs\\" style. After Deliverance, Redden was cast in Lamberto Bava's 1984 film Blastfighter. The film was recorded in and around Clayton, Georgia, and many people recall it as a mixture of Deliverance and First Blood. Redden next appeared in Tim Burton's 2003 film Big Fish. Burton was intent on getting Redden, as he wanted him to play the role of a banjo-playing \\"welcomer\\" in the utopian town of Spectre. Burton located Redden in Clayton, where he was part-owner of the Cookie Jar Caf√©, and also worked as a cook and dishwasher. In 2004, Redden made a guest appearance on Blue Collar TV, playing a car repairman named Ray in a \\"Redneck Dictionary\\" skit. He represented the word \\"raisin bread\\" (as in \\"Ray's inbred\\"). He played a banjo in the skit. In 2009, Redden played again his usual role (The banjo man) in Ace Cruz's film Outrage: Born in Terror. In 2012, 40 years after the release of Deliverance, Redden was interviewed in association with a documentary, The Deliverance of Rabun County (2012). It explored the feelings of people in Rabun County four decades later about the 1972 film. Redden said that though Deliverance was the best thing that happened to him, he never saw much money from the movie: Noting some locals objected to the stereotypes in the movie, Redden said that the people in Rabun County were good people: Filmography *Deliverance (1972) - Lonnie *Blastfighter (1984) - Banjo Man (uncredited) *Big Fish (2003) - Banjo Man *Outrage (2009) - Banjo Man References External links * * Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:American male film actors Category:American male child actors Category:Male actors from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:People from Clayton, Georgia ","title":"Billy Redden"},{"id":"2198418","title":"The Bride Stripped Bare (album)"},{"id":"2198431","title":"The Geffen Film Company"},{"id":"2198438","title":"Paige Moss"},{"id":"2198443","text":"Edward W. Conlon (born 1965) is an author and former New York Police Department (NYPD) officer. Biography Born in the Bronx, Conlon spent most of his childhood in nearby Yonkers, and attended Regis High School. He graduated from Harvard in 1987 before joining the force in 1995.Porter Brown, Nell. \\"NYPD Crimson\\". Harvard Magazine, January‚ÄìFebruary 2005. Conlon's police experience focused on patrolling city-owned public housing developments, as well as arresting street-level drug dealers after observing their sales from surveillance posts. In 2002, he was promoted to the rank of detective, and was assigned to the Bronx's 44th Precinct. He retired as a Detective, Second Grade, in 2011 after 16 years with the department. He is currently working with the NYPD communications office. Works After college Conlon wrote a novel which remains unsubmitted and unpublished. His first published article for The New Yorker was \\"To the Potter's Field\\" (1993), a bleak piece about Hart Island, New York. After joining the NYPD, Conlon wrote the Cop's Diary column for The New Yorker from 1997 to 2000 under the pen name Marcus Laffey. In the Sept 12. 2011 issue of the New Yorker, Conlon wrote a piece in the Talk of the Town section titled \\"Paying Attention\\" about 9/11 and his final days with the NYPD detective unit. He plans to continue writing. =Blue Blood= The column resulted in a nearly $1 million advance for Blue Blood (2004), which covers Conlon's years in the NYPD, his work conducting street-level narcotics enforcement in the Housing Bureau, his family's law enforcement background, and various anecdotes about the history of policing. The book received a favorable review on the cover of The New York Times Book Review, debuted at #9 on the Times Best Seller list, and remained on the list for two weeks. Conlon appeared as a guest on National Public Radio's talk show Fresh Air. The book was the basis of a 2007 television pilot that NBC commissioned'BLOOD' MONEY The New York Post, 23 November 2007. but ultimately did not order. =Red on Red= Conlon turned to fiction with this novel of police life that strays from actual NYPD investigative practice. Nick Meehan, a New York City detective slipping into mid-career burnout, is assigned a special case for Internal Affairs to investigate a suspected dirty cop. Meehan and his new detective partner, Esposito, look into a variety of other cases, including the apparent suicide of a recently arrived Mexican immigrant woman, gangland slayings by rival drug dealers (called \\"red on red\\" or criminal on criminal killings), and a serial rapist. In between writing about crime, Conlon's book examines the personal lives of his two main characters, the alliances and loyalties, the emotional tolls, the temptations, the shades of gray inherent to police work. The pace may be slower than the average thriller, but this novel was targeted to appeal to readers of literary crime writers such as George Pelecanos, Dennis Lehane, and Richard Price.

Direct administration by the British, which began in 1858, affected a political and economic unification of the subcontinent. When British rule came to an end in 1947, the subcontinent was partitioned along religious lines into two separate countries‚ÄîIndia, with a majority of Hindus, and Pakistan, with a majority of Muslims. Concurrently the Muslim-majority northwest and east of British India was separated into the Dominion of Pakistan, by the partition of India. The partition led to a population transfer of more than 10 million people between India and Pakistan and the death of about one million people. Indian National Congress leader Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Prime Minister of India, but the leader most associated with the independence struggle, Mahatma Gandhi, accepted no office. The Constitution adopted in 1950 made India a democratic country, and this democracy has been sustained since then. India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newly independent states. The nation has faced religious violence, casteism, naxalism, terrorism and regional separatist insurgencies. India has unresolved territorial disputes with China which in 1962 escalated into the Sino-Indian War, and with Pakistan which resulted in wars in 1947, 1965, 1971 and 1999. India was neutral in the Cold War, and a leader in the Non-Aligned Movement. It had a brief era of alliance with former Soviet Union, when Pakistan was closely allied to the United States and People's Republic of China. India is a nuclear-weapon state, having conducted its first nuclear test in 1974, followed by another five tests in 1998. From the 1950s to the 1980s, India followed socialist-inspired policies. The economy was influenced by extensive regulation, protectionism and public ownership, leading to pervasive corruption and slow economic growth. Beginning in 1991, neoliberal economic reforms have transformed India into the third largest and one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. From being a relatively destitute country in its formative years, Indian Republic has emerged as a fast growing G20 major economy with high military spending, and is seeking a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council. India has sometimes been referred to as a great power and a potential superpower given its large and growing economy, military and population.Strategic Vision: America & the Crisis of Global Power by Zbigniew Brzezinski, pp. 43‚Äì45. Published 2012. 1947‚Äì1950: Dominion of India Independent India's first years were marked with turbulent events ‚Äì a massive exchange of population with Pakistan, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 and the integration of over 500 princely states to form a united nation. Credit for the political integration of India is largely attributed to Vallabhbhai Patel (deputy Prime Minister of India at the time),The Indian Journal of Political Science, Vol. 28, No. 4 (October‚ÄìDecember 1967), pp. 236‚Äì241 who post- independence and before the death of Mahatma Gandhi teamed up with Jawaharlal Nehru and the Mahatma to ensure that the constitution of independent India would be secular. =Partition of India= An estimated 3.5 millionPakistan, Encarta. Archived 2009-10-31. Hindus and Sikhs living in West Punjab, North- West Frontier Province, Baluchistan, East Bengal and Sind migrated to India in fear of domination and suppression in Muslim Pakistan. Communal violence killed an estimated one million Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs, and gravely destabilised both dominions along their Punjab and Bengal boundaries, and the cities of Calcutta, Delhi and Lahore. The violence was stopped by early September owing to the co-operative efforts of both Indian and Pakistani leaders, and especially due to the efforts of Mohandas Gandhi, the leader of the Indian freedom struggle, who undertook a fast-unto-death in Calcutta and later in Delhi to calm people and emphasise peace despite the threat to his life. Both governments constructed large relief camps for incoming and leaving refugees, and the Indian Army was mobilised to provide humanitarian assistance on a massive scale. The assassination of Mohandas Gandhi on 30 January 1948 was carried out by Nathuram Vinayak Godse, a nationalist, who held him responsible for partition and charged that Mohandas Gandhi was appeasing Muslims. More than one million people flooded the streets of Delhi to follow the procession to cremation grounds and pay their last respects. In 1949, India recorded almost 1 million Hindu refugees into West Bengal and other states from East Pakistan, owing to communal violence, intimidation, and repression from Muslim authorities. The plight of the refugees outraged Hindus and Indian nationalists, and the refugee population drained the resources of Indian states, who were unable to absorb them. While not ruling out war, Prime Minister Nehru and Sardar Patel invited Liaquat Ali Khan for talks in Delhi. Although many Indians termed this appeasement, Nehru signed a pact with Liaquat Ali Khan that pledged both nations to the protection of minorities and creation of minority commissions. Although opposed to the principle, Patel decided to back this pact for the sake of peace, and played a critical role in garnering support from West Bengal and across India, and enforcing the provisions of the pact. Khan and Nehru also signed a trade agreement, and committed to resolving bilateral disputes through peaceful means. Steadily, hundreds of thousands of Hindus returned to East Pakistan, but the thaw in relations did not last long, primarily owing to the Kashmir dispute. =Integration of princely states= British India consisted of 17 provinces and 562 princely states. The provinces were given to India or Pakistan, in some cases in particular ‚Äî Punjab and Bengal ‚Äî after being partitioned. The princes of the princely states, however, were given the right to either remain independent or join either dominion. Thus India's leaders were faced with the prospect of inheriting a fragmented nation with independent provinces and kingdoms dispersed across the mainland. Under the leadership of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the new Government of India employed political negotiations backed with the option (and, on several occasions, the use) of the military action to ensure the primacy of the central government and of the Constitution then being drafted. Sardar Patel and V. P. Menon convinced the rulers of princely states contiguous to India to accede to India. Many rights and privileges of the rulers of the princely states, especially their personal estates and privy purses, were guaranteed to convince them to accede. Some of them were made Rajpramukh (governor) and Uprajpramukh (deputy governor) of the merged states. Many small princely states were merged to form viable administrative states such as Saurashra, PEPSU, Vindhya Pradesh and Madhya Bharat. Some princely states such as Tripura and Manipur acceded later in 1949. There were three states that proved more difficult to integrate than others: # Junagadh (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim Nawab) ‚Äì a December 1947 plebiscite resulted in a 99% vote to merge with India, annulling the controversial accession to Pakistan, which was made by the Nawab against the wishes of the people of the state who were overwhelmingly Hindu and despite Junagadh not being contiguous with Pakistan. # Hyderabad (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim nizam)‚Äì Patel ordered the Indian army to depose the government of the Nizam, code-named Operation Polo, after the failure of negotiations, which was done between 13‚Äì17 September 1948. It was incorporated as a state of India the next year. # The area of Kashmir (Muslim-majority state with a Hindu king) in the far north of the subcontinent quickly became a source of controversy that erupted into the First Indo-Pakistani War which lasted from 1947 to 1949. Eventually, a United Nations-overseen ceasefire was agreed that left India in control of two-thirds of the contested region. Jawaharlal Nehru initially agreed to Mountbatten's proposal that a plebiscite be held in the entire state as soon as hostilities ceased, and a UN-sponsored cease-fire was agreed to by both parties on 1 Jan. 1949. No statewide plebiscite was held, however, for in 1954, after Pakistan began to receive arms from the United States, Nehru withdrew his support. The Indian Constitution came into force in Kashmir on 26 January 1950 with special clauses for the state. =Constitution= The Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution of India, drafted by a committee headed by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, on 26 November 1949. India became a sovereign democratic republic after its constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950. Dr. Rajendra Prasad became the first President of India. The three words 'socialist', 'secular' and 'integrity' were added later with the 42nd Constitution Amendment 1976. =Indo-Pakistani War of 1947‚Äì1948= Indian soldiers during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947. The Indo- Pakistani War of 1947‚Äì1948 was fought between India and Pakistan over the princely state of Kashmir and Jammu from 1947 to 1948. It was the first of four Indo-Pakistan Wars fought between the two newly independent nations. Pakistan precipitated the war a few weeks after independence by launching tribal lashkar (militia) from Waziristan,Pakistan Covert Operations in an effort to secure Kashmir, the future of which hung in the balance. The inconclusive result of the war still affects the geopolitics of both countries. 1950s and 1960s first Prime Minister of India. He oversaw India's transition from a colony to a republic, while nurturing a plural, multi-party system. In foreign policy, he took a leading role in the Non- Aligned Movement while projecting India as a regional hegemon in South Asia. India held its first national elections under the Constitution in 1952, where a turnout of over 60% was recorded. The National Congress Party won an overwhelming majority, and Jawaharlal Nehru began a second term as Prime Minister. President Prasad was also elected to a second term by the electoral college of the first Parliament of India. =Nehru administration (1952‚Äì1964)= Prime Minister Nehru led the Congress to major election victories in 1957 and 1962. The Parliament passed extensive reforms that increased the legal rights of women in Hindu society, and further legislated against caste discrimination and untouchability. Nehru advocated a strong initiative to enroll India's children to complete primary education, and thousands of schools, colleges and institutions of advanced learning, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology, were founded across the nation., Indian Institute of Technology Nehru advocated a socialist model for the economy of India ‚Äî Five-Year Plans were shaped by the Soviet model based on centralised and integrated national economic programsSony Pellissery and Sam Geall \\"Five Year Plans\\" in Encyclopedia of Sustainability, Vol. 7 pp. 156‚Äì160 ‚Äî no taxation for Indian farmers, minimum wage and benefits for blue-collar workers, and the nationalisation of heavy industries such as steel, aviation, shipping, electricity, and mining. Village common lands were seized, and an extensive public works and industrialisation campaign resulted in the construction of major dams, irrigation canals, roads, thermal and hydroelectric power stations, and many more. =States reorganisation= South Indian states prior to the States Reorganisation Act. Potti Sreeramulu's fast- unto-death, and consequent death for the demand of an Andhra State in 1952 sparked a major re-shaping of the Indian Union. Nehru appointed the States Re- organisation Commission, upon whose recommendations the States Reorganisation Act was passed in 1956. Old states were dissolved and new states created on the lines of shared linguistic and ethnic demographics. The separation of Kerala and the Telugu-speaking regions of Madras State enabled the creation of an exclusively Tamil-speaking state of Tamil Nadu. On 1 May 1960, the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat were created out of the bilingual Bombay State, and on 1 November 1966, the larger Punjab state was divided into the smaller, Punjabi-speaking Punjab and Haryanvi-speaking Haryana states. = C. Rajagopalachari and formation of Swatantra Party= On 4 June 1959, shortly after the Nagpur session of the Indian National Congress, C. Rajagopalachari, along with Murari Vaidya of the newly established Forum of Free Enterprise (FFE)Erdman, p 66 and Minoo Masani, a classical liberal and critic of socialist Nehru, announced the formation of the new Swatantra Party at a meeting in Madras.Erdman, p 65 Conceived by disgruntled heads of former princely states such as the Raja of Ramgarh, the Maharaja of Kalahandi and the Maharajadhiraja of Darbhanga, the party was conservative in character.Erdman, p 74Erdman, p 72 Later, N. G. Ranga, K. M. Munshi, Field Marshal K. M. Cariappa and the Maharaja of Patiala joined the effort. Rajagopalachari, Masani and Ranga also tried but failed to involve Jayaprakash Narayan in the initiative.Erdman, p 78 In his short essay \\"Our Democracy\\", Rajagopalachari explained the necessity for a right-wing alternative to the Congress by saying: > since... the Congress Party has swung to the Left, what is wanted is not an > ultra or outer-Left [viz. the CPI or the Praja Socialist Party, PSP], but a > strong and articulate Right. Rajagopalachari also insisted that the opposition must: > operate not privately and behind the closed doors of the party meeting, but > openly and periodically through the electorate. He outlined the goals of the Swatantra Party through twenty one \\"fundamental principles\\" in the foundation document.Erdman, p 188 The party stood for equality and opposed government control over the private sector.Erdman, p 189Erdman, p 190 Rajagopalachari sharply criticised the bureaucracy and coined the term \\"licence-permit Raj\\" to describe Nehru's elaborate system of permissions and licences required for an individual to set up a private enterprise. Rajagopalachari's personality became a rallying point for the party. Rajagopalachari's efforts to build an anti-Congress front led to a patch up with his former adversary C. N. Annadurai of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Annadurai grew close to Rajagopalachari and sought an alliance with the Swatantra Party for the 1962 Madras legislative assembly elections. Although there were occasional electoral pacts between the Swatantra Party and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Rajagopalachari remained non-committal on a formal tie-up with the DMK due to its existing alliance with Communists whom he dreaded. The Swatantra Party contested 94 seats in the Madras state assembly elections and won six as well as won 18 parliamentary seats in the 1962 Lok Sabha elections. and the suppression of a pro-democracy movement in Hungary by the Soviet Union. Although Nehru disavowed nuclear ambitions for India, Canada and France aided India in the development of nuclear power stations for electricity. India also negotiated an agreement in 1960 with Pakistan on the just use of the waters of seven rivers shared by the countries. Nehru had visited Pakistan in 1953, but owing to political turmoil in Pakistan, no headway was made on the Kashmir dispute. India has fought a total of four wars/military conflicts with its rival nation Pakistan, two in this period. In the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, fought over the disputed territory of Kashmir, Pakistan captured one-third of Kashmir (which India claims as its territory), and India captured three-fifths (which Pakistan claims as its territory). In the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, India attacked Pakistan on all fronts by crossing the international border after attempts by Pakistani troops to infiltrate Indian-controlled Kashmir by crossing the de facto border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir. In 1961, after continual petitions for a peaceful handover, India invaded and annexed the Portuguese colony of Goa on the west coast of India. In 1962 China and India engaged in the brief Sino-Indian War over the border in the Himalayas. The war was a complete rout for the Indians and led to a refocusing on arms build-up and an improvement in relations with the United States. China withdrew from disputed territory in the contested Chinese South Tibet and Indian North-East Frontier Agency that it crossed during the war. India disputes China's sovereignty over the smaller Aksai Chin territory that it controls on the western part of the Sino-Indian border. =Post-Nehru India= Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi served as prime minister for three consecutive terms (1966‚Äì77) and a fourth term (1980‚Äì84). Jawaharlal Nehru died on 27 May 1964, and Lal Bahadur Shastri succeeded him as Prime Minister. In 1965, India and Pakistan again went to war over Kashmir, but without any definitive outcome or alteration of the Kashmir boundary. The Tashkent Agreement was signed under the mediation of the Soviet government, but Shastri died on the night after the signing ceremony. A leadership election resulted in the elevation of Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter who had been serving as Minister for Information and Broadcasting, as the third Prime Minister. She defeated right-wing leader Morarji Desai. The Congress Party won a reduced majority in the 1967 elections owing to widespread disenchantment over rising prices of commodities, unemployment, economic stagnation, and food crisis. Indira Gandhi had started on a rocky note after agreeing to a devaluation of the rupee, which created much hardship for Indian businesses and consumers, and the import of wheat from the United States fell through due to political disputes. Morarji Desai entered Gandhi's government as Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, and with senior Congress politicians attempted to constrain Gandhi's authority. But following the counsel of her political advisor P. N. Haksar, Gandhi resuscitated her popular appeal by a major shift towards socialist policies. She successfully ended the Privy Purse guarantee for former Indian royalty, and waged a major offensive against party hierarchy over the nationalisation of India's banks. Although resisted by Desai and India's business community, the policy was popular with the masses. When Congress politicians attempted to oust Gandhi by suspending her Congress membership, Gandhi was empowered with a large exodus of Members of Parliament to her own Congress (R). The bastion of the Indian freedom struggle, the Indian National Congress, had split in 1969. Gandhi continued to govern with a slim majority. 1970s Alize aircraft during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971. In 1971, Indira Gandhi and her Congress (R) were returned to power with a massively increased majority. The nationalisation of banks was carried out, and many other socialist economic and industrial policies enacted. India intervened in the Bangladesh War of Independence, a civil war taking place in Pakistan's Bengali half, after millions of refugees had fled the persecution of the Pakistani army. The clash resulted in the independence of East Pakistan, which became known as Bangladesh, and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's elevation to immense popularity. Relations with the United States grew strained, and India signed a 20-year treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union ‚Äì breaking explicitly for the first time from non-alignment. In 1974, India tested its first nuclear weapon in the desert of Rajasthan, near Pokhran. =Annexation of Sikkim= Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim. Sikkim became the 22nd state of the Indian Union. In 1973, anti-royalist riots took place in the Kingdom of Sikkim. In 1975, the Prime Minister of Sikkim appealed to the Indian Parliament for Sikkim to become a state of India. In April of that year, the Indian Army took over the city of Gangtok and disarmed the Chogyal's palace guards. Thereafter, a referendum was held in which 97.5 percent of voters supported abolishing the monarchy, effectively approving union with India. India is said to have stationed 20,000‚Äì40,000 troops in a country of only 200,000 during the referendum. On 16 May 1975, Sikkim became the 22nd state of the Indian Union, and the monarchy was abolished. To enable the incorporation of the new state, the Indian Parliament amended the Indian Constitution. First, the 35th Amendment laid down a set of conditions that made Sikkim an \\"Associate State\\", a special designation not used by any other state. A month later, the 36th Amendment repealed the 35th Amendment, and made Sikkim a full state, adding its name to the First Schedule of the Constitution. =Formation of Northeastern states= Assam in 1950s.pngAssam till the 1950s: The new states of Nagaland, Meghalaya and Mizoram formed in the 1960-70s. From Shillong, the capital of Assam was shifted to Dispur, now a part of Guwahati. After the Sino-Indian War in 1962, Arunachal Pradesh was also separated. Hornbil Festival, Kohima 6.jpgHornbill Festival, Kohima, Nagaland. Nagaland became a state in 1 December 1963.

Arunachal Pradesh became a state in 20 February 1987. SHSS building.jpgA school campus in Mizoram, which has one of the highest literacy rates in India. Mizoram became a state in 20 February 1987. In the Northeast India, the state of Assam was divided into several states beginning in 1970 within the borders of what was then Assam. In 1963, the Naga Hills district became the 16th state of India under the name of Nagaland. Part of Tuensang was added to Nagaland. In 1970, in response to the demands of the Khasi, Jaintia and Garo people of the Meghalaya Plateau, the districts embracing the Khasi Hills, Jaintia Hills, and Garo Hills were formed into an autonomous state within Assam; in 1972 this became a separate state under the name of Meghalaya. In 1972, Arunachal Pradesh (the North East Frontier Agency) and Mizoram (from the Mizo Hills in the south) were separated from Assam as union territories; both became states in 1986. =Green revolution and Operation Flood= India's population passed the 500 million mark in the early 1970s, but its long-standing food crisis was resolved with greatly improved agricultural productivity due to the Green Revolution. The government sponsored modern agricultural implements, new varieties of generic seeds, and increased financial assistance to farmers that increased the yield of food crops such as wheat, rice and corn, as well as commercial crops like cotton, tea, tobacco and coffee. Increased agricultural productivity expanded across the states of the Indo-Gangetic Plain and the Punjab. Under Operation Flood, the government encouraged the production of milk, which increased greatly, and improved rearing of livestock across India. This enabled India to become self-sufficient in feeding its own population, ending two decades of food imports. =Indo-Pakistan War of 1971= The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 concluded with Lieutenant-General A. A. K. Niazi, the commander of Pakistan Eastern Command, signing the instrument of surrender in Dhaka on 16 Dec 1971, in the presence of India's Lt. Gen. Jagjit Singh Aurora. Standing immediately behind from left to right: Indian Navy Vice Admiral Krishnan, Indian Air Force Air Marshal Dewan, Indian Army Lt Gen Sagat Singh, Maj Gen JFR Jacob (with Flt Lt Krishnamurthy peering over his shoulder). Veteran newscaster Surojit Sen of All India Radio is seen holding a microphone on the right. The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 was the third in four wars fought between the two nations. In this war, fought over the issue of self-rule in East Pakistan, India decisively defeated Pakistan, resulting in the creation of Bangladesh. =Indian Emergency= Economic and social problems, as well as allegations of corruption, caused increasing political unrest across India, culminating in the Bihar Movement. In 1974, the Allahabad High Court found Indira Gandhi guilty of misusing government machinery for election purposes. Opposition parties conducted nationwide strikes and protests demanding her immediate resignation. Various political parties united under Jaya Prakash Narayan to resist what he termed Gandhi's dictatorship. Leading strikes across India that paralysed its economy and administration, Narayan even called for the Army to oust Gandhi. In 1975, Gandhi advised President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed to declare a state of emergency under the constitution, which allowed the central government to assume sweeping powers to defend law and order in the nation. Explaining the breakdown of law and order and threat to national security as her primary reasons, Gandhi suspended many civil liberties and postponed elections at national and state levels. Non-Congress governments in Indian states were dismissed, and nearly 1,000 opposition political leaders and activists were imprisoned and a programme of compulsory birth control introduced. Strikes and public protests were outlawed in all forms. India's economy benefited from an end to paralysing strikes and political disorder. India announced a 20-point programme which enhanced agricultural and industrial production, increasing national growth, productivity, and job growth. But many organs of government and many Congress politicians were accused of corruption and authoritarian conduct. Police officers were accused of arresting and torturing innocent people. Indira's son and political advisor, Sanjay Gandhi, was accused of committing gross excesses ‚Äì Sanjay was blamed for the Health Ministry carrying out forced vasectomies of men and sterilisation of women as a part of the initiative to control population growth, and for the demolition of slums in Delhi near the Turkmen Gate, which left thousands of people dead and many more displaced. =Janata interlude= Morarji Desai, the first non-Congress Prime Minister of India, signing the \\"New Delhi\\" declaration during a visit by US President Jimmy Carter. Indira Gandhi's Congress Party called for general elections in 1977, only to suffer a humiliating electoral defeat at the hands of the Janata Party, an amalgamation of opposition parties.M.R. Masani, \\"India's Second Revolution,\\" Asian Affairs (1977) 5#1 pp 19‚Äì38. Morarji Desai became the first non-Congress Prime Minister of India. The Desai administration established tribunals to investigate Emergency-era abuses, and Indira and Sanjay Gandhi were arrested after a report from the Shah Commission. In 1979, the coalition crumbled and Charan Singh formed an interim government. The Janata Party had become intensely unpopular due to its internecine warfare, and a perceived lack of leadership on solving India's serious economic and social problems. 1980s Akal Takht and Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple), was repaired by the Indian Government after Operation Blue Star. Indira Gandhi and her Congress Party splinter group, the Indian National Congress or simply \\"Congress\\", were swept back into power with a large majority in January 1980. But the rise of an insurgency in Punjab would jeopardise India's security. In Assam, there were many incidents of communal violence between native villagers and refugees from Bangladesh, as well as settlers from other parts of India. When Indian forces, undertaking Operation Blue Star, raided the hideout of self-rule pressing Khalistan militants in the Golden Temple ‚Äî Sikhs‚Äô most holy shrine ‚Äî in Amritsar, the inadvertent deaths of civilians and damage to the temple building inflamed tensions in the Sikh community across India. The Government used intensive police operations to crush militant operations, but it resulted in many claims of abuse of civil liberties. Northeast India was paralysed owing to the ULFA's clash with Government forces. On 31 October 1984, the Prime Minister's own Sikh bodyguards assassinated her, and 1984 anti-Sikh riots erupted in Delhi and parts of Punjab, causing the deaths of thousands of Sikhs along with terrible pillage, arson, and rape. Senior members of the Congress Party have been implicated in stirring the violence against Sikhs. Government investigation has failed to date to discover the causes and punish the perpetrators, but public opinion blamed Congress leaders for directing attacks on Sikhs in Delhi. =Rajiv Gandhi administration= INSAT system is the largest domestic communication system in the Asia Pacific Region. It is a series of multipurpose geo-stationary satellites launched by ISRO to satisfy the telecommunications, broadcasting, meteorology, and search and rescue operations in India. The Congress party chose Rajiv Gandhi, Indira's older son, as the next Prime Minister. Rajiv had been elected to Parliament only in 1982, and at 40, was the youngest national political leader and Prime Minister ever. But his youth and inexperience were an asset in the eyes of citizens tired of the inefficacy and corruption of career politicians, and looking for newer policies and a fresh start to resolve the country's long-standing problems. The Parliament was dissolved, and Rajiv led the Congress party to its largest majority in history (over 415 seats out of 545 possible), reaping a sympathy vote over his mother's assassination. Rajiv Gandhi initiated a series of reforms: the Licence Raj was loosened, and government restrictions on foreign currency, travel, foreign investment, and imports decreased considerably. This allowed private businesses to use resources and produce commercial goods without government bureaucracy interfering, and the influx of foreign investment increased India's national reserves. As Prime Minister, Rajiv broke from his mother's precedent to improve relations with the United States, which increased economic aid and scientific co-operation. Rajiv's encouragement of science and technology resulted in a major expansion of the telecommunications industry and India's space programme, and gave birth to the software industry and information technology sector. Victims of Bhopal disaster march demanding the extradition of American Warren Anderson from the United States. In December 1984, gas leaked out at the Union Carbide pesticides plant in the central Indian city of Bhopal. Thousands were killed immediately, while many more subsequently died or were left disabled. India in 1987 brokered an agreement with the Government of Sri Lanka and agreed to deploy troops for peacekeeping operation in Sri Lanka's ethnic conflict led by the LTTE. Rajiv sent Indian troops to enforce the agreement and disarm the Tamil rebels, but the Indian Peace Keeping Force, as it was known, became entangled in outbreaks of violence, ultimately ending up fighting the Tamil rebels itself, and becoming a target of attack from Sri Lankan nationalists. V. P. Singh withdrew the IPKF in 1990, but thousands of Indian soldiers had died. Rajiv's departure from Socialist policies did not sit well with the masses, who did not benefit from the innovations. Unemployment was a serious problem, and India's burgeoning population added ever-increasing needs for diminishing resources. Rajiv Gandhi's image as an honest politician (he was nicknamed \\"Mr. Clean\\" by the press) was shattered when the Bofors scandal broke, revealing that senior government officials had taken bribes over defence contracts by a Swedish guns producer. =Janata Dal= General elections in 1989 gave Rajiv's Congress a plurality, a far cry from the majority which propelled him to power. Power came instead to his former finance and defence minister, VP Singh of Janata Dal. Singh had been moved from the Finance ministry to the Defence ministry after he unearthed some scandals which made the Congress leadership uncomfortable. Singh then unearthed the Bofors scandal, and was sacked from the party and office. Becoming a popular crusader for reform and clean government, Singh led the Janata Dal coalition to a majority. He was supported by BJP and the leftist parties from outside. Becoming Prime Minister, Singh made an important visit to the Golden Temple shrine, to heal the wounds of the past. He implemented the Mandal Commission report, to increase the quota in reservation for low- caste Hindus. His government fell after Singh, along with Bihar's Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav's government, had Advani arrested in Samastipur and stopped his Ram Rath Yatra, which was going to the Babri Masjid site in Ayodhya on 23 October 1990. Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew their support to Singh government, causing them to lose parliamentary vote of confidence on 7 November 1990. Chandra Shekhar split to form the Janata Dal (Socialist), supported by Rajiv's Congress. This new government also collapsed in a matter of months, when Congress withdrew its support. 1990s The stone mosaic that stands at the exact location where Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in Sriperumbudur. The then-Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Farooq Abdullah (son of former Chief Minister Sheikh Abdullah) announced an alliance with the ruling Congress party for the elections of 1987. But, the elections were allegedly rigged in favour of him. This led to the rise of the armed extremist insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir composed, in part, of those who unfairly lost elections. India has constantly maintained the position of blaming Pakistan for supplying these groups with logistical support, arms, recruits and training. Militants in Kashmir reportedly tortured and killed local Kashmiri Pandits, forcing them to leave Kashmir in large numbers. Around 90% of the Kashmiri Pandits left Kashmir during the 1990s, resulting in the ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Hindus. On 21 May 1991, while former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi campaigned in Tamil Nadu on behalf of Congress (Indira), a Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) female suicide bomber assassinated him and many others by setting off the bomb in her belt by leaning forward while garlanding him. In the elections, Congress (Indira) won 244 parliamentary seats and put together a coalition, returning to power under the leadership of P.V. Narasimha Rao. This Congress-led government, which served a full five- year term, initiated a gradual process of economic liberalisation and reform, which has opened the Indian economy to global trade and investment. India's domestic politics also took new shape, as traditional alignments by caste, creed, and ethnicity gave way to a plethora of small, regionally-based political parties. But India was rocked by communal violence (see Bombay riots) between Hindus and Muslims that killed over 10,000 people, following the Babri Mosque demolition by Hindu extremists in the course of the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute in Ayodhya in 1992. The final months of the Rao-led government in the spring of 1996 suffered the effects of several major political corruption scandals, which contributed to the worst electoral performance by the Congress Party in its history as the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party emerged as the largest single party. =Economic reforms= Under the policies initiated by late Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao and his then-Finance Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, India's economy expanded rapidly. The economic reforms were a reaction to an impending balance of payment crisis. The Rao administration initiated the privatisation of large, inefficient, and loss-inducing government corporations. The UF government had attempted a progressive budget that encouraged reforms, but the 1997 Asian financial crisis and political instability created economic stagnation. The Vajpayee administration continued with privatisation, reduction of taxes, a sound fiscal policy aimed at reducing deficits and debts, and increased initiatives for public works. Cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune, and Ahmedabad have risen in prominence and economic importance, becoming centres of rising industries and destinations for foreign investment and firms. Strategies like forming Special Economic Zones ‚Äì tax amenities, good communications infrastructure, low regulation ‚Äì to encourage industries has paid off in many parts of the country. A rising generation of well-educated and skilled professionals in scientific sectors of the industry began propelling the Indian economy, as the information technology industry took hold across India with the proliferation of computers. The new technologies increased the efficiency of activity in almost every type of industry, which also benefitted from the availability of skilled labor. Foreign investment and outsourcing of jobs to India's labor markets further enhanced India's economic growth. A large middle class has arisen across India, which has increased the demand, and thus the production of a wide array of consumer goods. Unemployment is steadily declining, and poverty has fallen to approximately 22%. Gross Domestic Product growth increased to beyond 7%. While serious challenges remain, India is enjoying a period of economic expansion that has propelled it to the forefront of the world economy, and has correspondingly increased its influence in political and diplomatic terms. =Era of coalitions= Agni-II ballistic missile. Since May 1998, India declared itself to be a full-fledged nuclear state. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged from the May 1996 national elections as the single-largest party in the Lok Sabha but without enough strength to prove a majority on the floor of that Parliament. Under Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the BJP coalition lasted in power 13 days. With all political parties wishing to avoid another round of elections, a 14-party coalition led by the Janata Dal emerged to form a government known as the United Front. A United Front government under former Chief Minister of Karnataka H.D. Deve Gowda lasted less than a year. The leader of the Congress Party withdrew support in March 1997. Inder Kumar Gujral replaced Deve Gowda as the consensus choice for Prime Minister of a 16-party United Front coalition. In November 1997, the Congress Party again withdrew support for the United Front. New elections in February 1998 brought the BJP the largest number of seats in Parliament (182), but this fell far short of a majority. On 20 March 1998, the President inaugurated a BJP-led coalition government, with Vajpayee again serving as Prime Minister. On 11 and 13 May 1998, this government conducted a series of five underground nuclear weapons tests, known collectively as Pokhran-II ‚Äî which caused Pakistan to conduct its own tests that same year.CIA Factbook. Retrieved 22 December 2011 India's nuclear tests prompted President of the United States Bill Clinton and Japan to impose economic sanctions on India pursuant to the 1994 Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act and led to widespread international condemnation. In the early months of 1999, Prime Minister Vajpayee made a historic bus trip to Pakistan and met with Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, signing the bilateral Lahore peace declaration. In April 1999, the coalition government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fell apart, leading to fresh elections in September. In May and June 1999, India discovered an elaborate campaign of terrorist infiltration that resulted in the Kargil War in Kashmir, derailing a promising peace process that had begun only three months earlier when Prime Minister Vajpayee visited Pakistan, inaugurating the Delhi-Lahore bus service. Indian forces killed Pakistan-backed infiltrators and reclaimed important border posts in high-altitude warfare. Soaring on popularity earned following the successful conclusion of the Kargil conflict, the National Democratic Alliance ‚Äì a new coalition led by the BJP ‚Äì gained a majority to form a government with Vajpayee as Prime Minister in October 1999. The end of the millennium was devastating to India, as a cyclone hit Orissa, killing at least 10,000. 2000s =Under Bharatiya Janata Party= Atal Bihari Vajpayee became the first non-Congress Prime Minister to complete a full term. His tenure saw rapid growth of infrastructure, improved diplomatic relationship with the United States, economic reforms, nuclear tests, several foreign policy and military victories. In May 2000, India's population exceeded 1 billion. President of the United States Bill Clinton made a groundbreaking visit to India to improve ties between the two nations. In January, massive earthquakes hit Gujarat state, killing at least 30,000. Prime Minister Vajpayee met with Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf in the first summit between Pakistan and India in more than two years in the middle of 2001. But the meeting failed without a breakthrough or even a joint statement because of differences over Kashmir region. Three new states ‚Äî Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand (originally Uttaranchal) ‚Äî were formed in November 2000. The National Democratic Alliance government's credibility was adversely affected by a number of political scandals (such as allegations that the Defence Minister George Fernandes took bribes) as well as reports of intelligence failures that led to the Kargil incursions going undetected, and the apparent failure of his talks with the Pakistani President. Following the 11 September attacks, the United States lifted sanctions which it had imposed against India and Pakistan in 1998. The move was seen as a reward for their support for the War on Terror. The tensions of an imminent war between India and Pakistan again rose by the heavy Indian firing on Pakistani military posts along the Line of Control and the subsequent deadly Indian Parliament attack and the 2001‚Äì02 India‚ÄìPakistan standoff. In 2002, 59 Hindu pilgrims returning from Ayodhya were killed in a train fire in Godhra, Gujarat.

The project was launched in 2001 by NDA government led by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Throughout 2003, India's speedy economic progress, political stability, and a rejuvenated peace initiative with Pakistan increased the government's popularity. India and Pakistan agreed to resume direct air links and to allow overflights, and a groundbreaking meeting was held between the Indian government and moderate Kashmir separatists. The Golden Quadrilateral project aimed to link India's corners with a network of modern highways. =Congress rule returns= In January 2004 Prime Minister Vajpayee recommended early dissolution of the Lok Sabha and general elections. The Congress Party-led alliance won a surprise victory in elections held in May 2004. Manmohan Singh became the Prime Minister, after the Congress President Sonia Gandhi, the widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, declined to take the office, in order to defuse the controversy about whether her foreign birth should be considered a disqualification for the Prime Minister's post. The Congress formed a coalition called the United Progressive Alliance with Socialist and regional parties, and enjoyed the outside support of India's Communist parties. Manmohan Singh became the first Sikh and non-Hindu to hold India's most powerful office. Singh continued economic liberalisation, although the need for support from Indian Socialists and Communists forestalled further privatisation for some time.India Rising ‚Äì Newsweek and The Daily Beast. Newsweek.com (5 March 2006). Retrieved on 12 July 2013. By the end of 2004, India began to withdraw some of its troops from Kashmir. By the middle of the next year, the Srinagar‚ÄìMuzaffarabad Bus service was inaugurated, the first in 60 years to operate between Indian-administered and Pakistani-administered Kashmirs. However, in May 2006, suspected Islamic extremist militants killed 35 Hindus in the worst attacks in Indian- administered Kashmir for several months. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami devastated Indian coastlines and islands, killing an estimated 18,000 and displacing around 650,000. The tsunami was caused by a powerful undersea earthquake off the Indonesian coast. Natural disasters such as the Mumbai floods (killing more than 1,000) and Kashmir earthquake (killing 79,000) hit the subcontinent in the next year. In February 2006, the United Progressive Alliance government launched India's largest-ever rural jobs scheme, aimed at lifting around 60 million families out of poverty. President George W. Bush and India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh exchange handshakes in New Delhi on 2 March 2006 vis-√†-vis the India‚ÄìUnited States Civil Nuclear Agreement. The United States and India signed a major nuclear co-operation agreement during a visit by United States President George W. Bush in March 2006. According to the nuclear deal, the United States was to give India access to civilian nuclear technology while India agreed to greater scrutiny for its nuclear programme. Later, United States approved a controversial law allowing India to buy their nuclear reactors and fuel for the first time in 30 years. In July 2008, the United Progressive Alliance survived a vote of confidence brought after left-wing parties withdrew their support over the nuclear deal. After the vote, several left-wing and regional parties formed a new alliance to oppose the government, saying it had been tainted by corruption. Within three months, following approval by the U.S. Congress, George W. Bush signed into law a nuclear deal with India, which ended a three-decade ban on American nuclear trade with Delhi. In 2007, India got its first female President as Pratibha Patil was sworn in. Long associated with the Nehru‚ÄìGandhi family, Pratibha Patil was a low-profile governor of the state of Rajasthan before emerging as the favoured presidential candidate of Sonia Gandhi.

India was now being looked at as a potential superpower.  2010s  =Congress rule continues= The 2010 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony in Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium is one of the largest international multi-sport events to be staged in Delhi and India. The concerns and controversies over the 2010 Commonwealth Games rocked the country in 2010, raising questions about the credibility of the government followed by the 2G spectrum case and Adarsh Housing Society scam. In mid-2011, Anna Hazare, a prominent social activist, staged a 12-day hunger strike in Delhi in protest at state corruption, after government proposals to tighten up anti- graft legislation fell short of his demands. Despite all this, India showed great promise with a higher growth rate in gross domestic product. In January 2011, India assumed a nonpermanent seat in the United Nations Security Council for the 2011‚Äì12 term.

The area is heavily forested and there are many monkeys and leopards in the area.  History  According to city legend, the place earned its name on accident. Before the independence of Pakistan, a foreigner came to visit this place. He did not know its name, so he asked an old woman what its name was. She did not speak English and was carrying a pot of flour on her head. She assumed he was asking about the flour and replied to him in either Northern-Punjabi or a Northern- Pakistani language, \\"Puttar, Atta.\\" This translates to \\"Son, [it is] flour.\\" From then on, the place was named Pathriata and is similar to the Northern- Punjabi and Northern-Pakistani words Puttar Atta.

It serves the South Bay cities of Los Angeles County. Its slogan is \\"LAX to LA Harbor\\".  Early history  The paper was founded as the weekly The Breeze in 1894 by local political activist S. D. Barkley and first served the local Redondo Beach community. Coverage eventually spread to other coastal cities, and by 1922, it had become a daily publication. In 1928, the Daily Breeze was purchased by Copley Press. The competition went out of business in 1970 (The Torrance Herald, 1913‚Äì1969).  Modern history  Like most of the newspaper industry, the Daily Breeze has suffered its share of hardships, with the rise of free news on the Internet and the competitive Los Angeles media market. It merged with the (San Pedro) News-Pilot in 1999. In 2005, it added to its circulation numbers through the purchase of two local weeklies, The Beach Reporter and Palos Verdes Peninsula News. In 2003, it created another weekly, More San Pedro, in the Harbor Area. In December 2006, the paper was sold to the Hearst Corporation in a complex transaction that left the paper under the day-to-day control of Dean Singleton's MediaNews Group and its subsidiary, the Los Angeles Newspaper Group (LANG). Singleton announced that he would fold the paper into the LANG operations, but not cut salaries. Singleton will eventually come to own the Daily Breeze under a 2007 plan to acquire ownership of the paper as part of a swap with Hearst in which Hearst would trade some California papers and the St. Paul Pioneer Press for an increased stake in Singleton's non-California operations. In 2008, the paper ceased producing its weekly supplement, More San Pedro. Nine staff members were laid off at the same time including four reporters, a web editor, and a newsroom assistant.

Fictional character history Jacques Duquesne grew up as a privileged youth in the (fictional) Southeast Asian nation of Siancong, then under French rule. Unlike his father and other European residents, Duquesne held no prejudice against the Siancongese natives, and after performing an act of kindness for a native servant, he was invited to join a communist rebellion against French rule. As the costumed Swordsman, Duquesne, fancying himself a swashbuckling freedom fighter, helped liberate Siancong, only to learn the rebel leader Wong Chu had killed Duquesne's father. Devastated and disillusioned, Duquesne departed Siancong to seek adventure.Avengers Spotlight #22 (1989). Marvel Comics. Nothing else is known of Duquesne's early career, but he eventually joined the Carson Carnival of Traveling Wonders; although his swordplay made him one of the carnival's star attractions, he gradually descended into gambling and drunkenness, his youthful idealism long behind him. Eventually Duquesne, by now in his thirties or older, took a young runaway named Clint Barton under his wing and taught him how to use bladed weapons, while another performer, Trick Shot, taught Barton archery, at which he proved to be a master.Avengers (vol. 1) #19 (Aug 1965). Marvel Comics. The young Clint stumbled upon Duquesne stealing money from the carnival's paymaster to pay a gambling debt. Clint attempted to turn his mentor over to the law, but he was pursued by Duquesne and badly beaten. Before Duquesne could deliver the fatal blow, Trick Shot stepped in to save the young boy. Duquesne then fled the carnival and adopted his swordsplay act to become a costumed supervillain.Hawkeye Vol. 3 #2‚Äì3. Marvel Comics. Years later, the Swordsman attempted to join the Avengers (whose members included Clint Barton, now known as the superhero Hawkeye) in order to take advantage of the benefits that go with an Avenger ID. He was refused entry into the team, largely due to Hawkeye's protests and the fact he was wanted in different states, and threatened to kill Captain America after capturing him, but the rest were able to rescue him. After failing the first time around, he was accepted into the Avengers. However, he was secretly an agent of the Mandarin, who had teleported him to his castle before the Avengers could capture him, and created a pseudo-image of Iron Man to recommend the Swordsman to the Avengers. The Mandarin also fitted the Swordsman's sword with extra powers, such as firing artificial lightning bolts, though he warned the Swordsman if they were ever pointed at him they would reverse. Soon after joining the Avengers, the Swordsman revealed his true intentions and betrayed the team, planting a bomb on the control panels which could be activated by remote-control. He soon had a change of heart and betrayed the Mandarin to save the Avengers. Despite his heroics, the Swordsman left the ranks of the Avengers, knowing the Mandarin would now be against him.Avengers #20. Marvel Comics.

In the early to mid 1980s, Punnett hosted the WLRW morning show in his college town along with Val Wallace. Punnett co-hosted Ian and Margery with his wife on KTMY in Minneapolis-St. Paul and was the regular Saturday night host of the widely syndicated paranormal-themed Coast to Coast AM, created by Art Bell. On December 3, 2011, Punnett announced that due to increasingly acute tinnitus, he would temporarily step down as regular Saturday night host of Coast to Coast AM, being replaced by John B. Wells: effective January 2012, Punnett would host the show one Sunday per month. In July 2013, Punnett ended his radio hosting career in order to begin studies for a doctoral degree. After receiving his Ph.D. in 2017, he returned as an occasional guest host of Coast to Coast AM in 2018 and became a faculty member at Kansas State University. Life Punnett graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he was a student columnist for the Daily Illini. After college, under the pseudonym \\"Ian Case\\" (his first and middle names transposed), he co-hosted rock morning radio shows on WXLP in the Quad Cities called Ian Case and the Coach and then Ian Case and The Duke with Mike \\"The Duke\\" Donegan on then-rock music station WKDF in Nashville, Tennessee in the early-to-mid-1990s. In between his Quad Cities stints, Punnett was also morning man on WMJY in Long Branch, New Jersey. Punnett went on to talk radio at WGN in Chicago in 1994, then went to Atlanta, Georgia in 1997 to host a nightly talk show on WGST under his real name, Ian Punnett. He returned to the WKDF morning show in 1998, though he remained in Atlanta and broadcast the show from his home studio (while co-host Mike \\"Duke\\" Donegan broadcast from the station's Nashville studio). Punnett would occasionally slip up and announce his real name instead of the pseudonym, which inadvertently became a running gag. That show's run came to an end in early 1999, shortly before WKDF switched to a country music format. In Minneapolis-St. Paul, Punnett hosted the morning show (6-10 am) on KTMY-FM. The show was known as Ian & Margery, and was co-hosted by his wife, Margery (a former TV producer who has worked for CNN as well as for The Oprah Winfrey Show) who did her part of the show from a studio in their home while getting their two teenage boys off to school. Punnett has a Master of Divinity degree from Columbia Theological Seminary in Atlanta, a PhD from the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University and has been ordained a Deacon in the Episcopal Church. Since 1998, Punnett has intermittently hosted Coast to Coast AM. On August 1, 2007, Punnett helped report the Minneapolis bridge collapse on CNN. =Coast to Coast AM= In 1998 Punnett began occasionally hosting Coast to Coast AM. In April 2000, Punnett became the regular Sunday-night host for Coast to Coast. He was the first person other than Art Bell to be \\"given\\" a night of the week in his or her name. In December, 2001, Punnett left Coast to Coast AM with Ian Punnett to do mornings in the Twin Cities for Hubbard Broadcasting and to concentrate on finishing seminary. His replacement for Sunday nights was George Noory who would eventually take over the entire show when Art Bell retired again a few years later. Although Punnett occasionally acted as a guest host, he did not rejoin Coast to Coast AM on a full-time basis until June 2005 when Art Bell, who had been doing the two weekend shifts again, announced that he wanted to host just one night a week in order to spend more time traveling with his wife, Ramona. Coast to Coast AM with Ian Punnett once again returned to the weekly line-up, this time on Saturdays. On January 21, 2006, after the death of Ramona Bell, Punnett announced that Art Bell, the creator and original host of Coast to Coast AM would be returning from retirement to host each Saturday and Sunday night. Punnett then moved to Coast to Coast Live with Ian Punnett, a new, four-hour program, on January 28, 2006. The new show occupied a slot (6 pm-10 pm PST/9 pm-1 am EST), the same period that previously broadcast repeats of older Coast to Coast AM episodes (Coast to Coast AM begins at 1 am ET/10 pm PT). Many existing Coast to Coast AM affiliates automatically carried Punnett's new program from its first night, and in subsequent months several new affiliates came on board. As of June 2007, its affiliate count stood around 200. Since his affiliation with C2CAM (especially during his tenure with Coast to Coast Live), Punnett developed a loyal following of his own. He always opened the show with the \\"reminder\\" to \\"hostile invading aliens\\" hovering just beyond Earth's atmosphere to \\"eat the Canadians first\\", saying they are \\"much tastier\\" than Americans. After the retirement of Art Bell in July 2007, Coast to Coast Live was discontinued, with Punnett once again becoming host of the Saturday night edition of C2CAM. Show episodes with themes pertaining to cryptozoology or government conspiracies (favorite subjects of Coast to Coast AM) were generally designated to Punnett and slotted for Saturday nights. On December 3, 2011, Punnett announced that due to increasing problems with his tinnitus, that he would have to step down as regular Saturday night host of Coast to Coast AM, being replaced by John B. Wells; as of January 2012, Punnett began hosting the show one Sunday per month. On May 16, 2013, Punnett announced on the air with George Noory that he would no longer be hosting Coast to Coast one Sunday per month. Punnett hosted his then-last show on July 14, 2013, his 479th episode over 13 years.http://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/thanks-for- the-memories On May 6, 2018, George Noory announced that Punnett would return as a host of Coast to Coast, due to improvements in managing his tinnitus symptoms. Beginning in May 2018, Punnett has hosted several shows each month, as one of the show's designated fill-in hosts for nights when Noory was unavailable. Personal life Prior to becoming a father, pastor and host for Coast to Coast AM, Punnett held many jobs before beginning his new career as a morning disc-jockey at a local radio station. According to a radio industry executive, Ian started hosting a radio show and the ratings went through the roof. And his general manager loved Punnett. After five years, Punnett decided to enroll in a seminary and eventually host Coast to Coast AM. In 2010, Punnett also published a children's book, Dizzy the Mutt with the Propeller Butt. His second children's picture book Jackula the Vampire Dog was published in 2011. His book How to Pray When You're Pissed at GodSee HowToPraybook.com was published in April, 2013 by Harmony. The book was inspired by Punnett's discovery during his duties as a chaplain that many religious Americans were uncomfortable expressing anger to clergy or in their prayers. His goal was to illustrate with examples from the Bible how expressing anger is acceptable, even anger towards God. Punnett entered the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University as a Ph.D. student in August 2013. He taught multimedia journalism at Ohio Northern University from 2016- 17.http://nr.onu.edu/taxonomy/term/10217 Punnett received his doctorate from Arizona State in 2017, after writing a dissertation titled \\"Toward a Theory of True Crime: Forms and Functions of Nonfiction Murder Narratives.\\" https://repository.asu.edu/items/43954 He is currently a faculty member at Kansas State University.

In the United States, it often refers specifically to a version made primarily with ground (\\"Indian\\") corn, and it is mentioned in the lyrics of \\"Yankee Doodle,\\" a traditional American song of the eighteenth century.\\" Terminology Since at least the 16th century, a dish called hasty pudding has been found in British cuisine made of wheat flour that has been cooked in boiling milk or water until it reaches the consistency of a thick batter or an oatmeal porridge.Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. hasty pudding It was a staple dish for the English for centuries. The earliest known recipes for hasty pudding date to the 17th century. There are three examples in Robert May's The Accomplisht Cook. The first is made with flour, cream, raisins, currants and butter, the second recipe is for a boiled pudding and the third includes grated bread, eggs and sugar. Hasty pudding was used by Hannah Glasse as a term for batter or oatmeal porridge in The Art of Cookery (1747). It's also mentioned in Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of 1755 as a combination of either milk and flour or oatmeal and water. Its also one of the recipes found in The Compleat Housewife where it is made with grated penny loaf, cream, egg yolks, sack (or orange blossom water) and sugar. American cuisine Indian pudding is a traditional American dessert, \\"a cold-weather classic\\" in the cuisine of New England. It was commonplace in the colonial era and enjoyed a revival as part of Thanksgiving Day celebrations in the late 19th century. It was found in most American cookbooks before 1900. The 20th century's commercial puddings with their industrially perfect smooth consistency displaced Indian pudding, and its cooking time had little appeal for the modern home cook. It is still associated with autumn holidays and occasionally revived by restaurants. It is usually served warm and sometimes accompanied by vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. =Colonial United States= Seventeenth-century English colonists brought hasty pudding to North America and transformed it completely. Lacking wheat, they substituted cornmeal, a grain they learned to cultivate from the indigenous peoples, which led to the new name Indian pudding, derived from their name for cornmeal, Indian meal. They substituted milk, which was plentiful, for water and added locally available sweeteners, either molasses or maple syrup, and spices when available, typically cinnamon and ground ginger. Other traditional ingredients include butter and eggs for a smoother consistency and raisins and nuts for flavor and contrasting texture. Finally, Indian pudding was baked in a slow oven for several hours, transforming its texture from the porridge-like quality of hasty pudding to a smoother texture more typical of custard puddings. According to Kathleen Wall, Plimoth Plantation's expert on colonial cooking, \\"The longer it cooks, the more liquid the gritty cornmeal absorbs, and the more it absorbs, the smoother the texture of your pudding.\\" In 1643 Roger Williams called the dish \\"nasaump\\":The American Journal of Science and Arts, Volumes 41-42 p.30 \\"Nasaump, a kind of meale pottage, unpartch'd. From this the English call their samp, which is the Indian corne, beaten and boild, and eaten hot or cold, with milke or butter, which are mercies beyond the Natives plaine water, and which is a dish exceeding wholesome for the English bodies.\\" =Antebellum period= Eliza Leslie, an influential American cookbook author of the early 19th century, includes a recipe for flour hasty pudding in her 1840 Directions for Cookery, In Its Various Branches, and calls the corn type \\"Indian mush.\\" She calls an oatmeal version burgoo. She stresses the need for slow cooking rather than haste, and also recommends the use of a special mush-stick for stirring to prevent lumps. (This mush-stick is perhaps related to the spurtle, or the pudding stick of the nursery rhyme beating.) Catherine Beecher's recipe: > Wet up the Indian meal in cold water, till there are no lumps, stir it > gradually into boiling water which has been salted, till so thick that the > stick will stand in it. Boil slowly, and so as not to burn, stirring often. > Two or three hours' boiling is needed. Pour it into a broad, deep dish, let > it grow cold, cut it into slices half an inch thick, flour them, and fry > them on a griddle with a little lard, or bake them in a stone oven. \\"Yankee Doodle\\" and other literary references Hasty pudding is referred to in a verse of the early American song \\"Yankee Doodle\\": It is also referenced in Louisa May Alcott's Little Men (1871): \\"on their garden plot, Emil and Franz grow corn to supply the family with pudding and Johnny cake.\\" Similar dishes In the recipe for the Brazilian pudding (), sweet corn grains are taken raw together with milk and most often coconut milk to a blender until uniformly liquid, then cooked until it becomes thick; shredded coconut might be added in the last minutes; cinnamon powder is sprinkled at the end. When boiled wrapped in corn husks is called pamonha. Polenta is the savory Italian version of hasty pudding, with maize/corn substituted for the wheat originally used by the Romans.

Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Muscicapa pica in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The pied water tyrant is now placed in the genus Fluvicola that was introduced by the English naturalist William John Swainson in 1827. The species in monotypic. The genus name is derived from a combination of Latin fluvius meaning \\"river and -cola meaning \\"dweller\\". The specific epithet pica is Latin for \\"magpie\\". Description The pied water tyrant is 13.5 cm long and weighs 13g. Adults are mainly white with a black nape, back, wings and tail. Sexes are similar, although the female may have some brown mixed with the black, and immature birds are brown where the adult is black. The call is a nasal djweeooo. Distribution and habitat This species is found in marshy savannahs and the edges of mangrove swamps. The nest is a feather-lined oval ball of grasses and other plant material, with a side entrance. It is placed at the end of a branch near or over water. Both sexes incubate the typical clutch of two or three creamy-white eggs, which are marked with a few brown spots. Cowbirds sometimes parasitise the nest. Pied water tyrants often bob up and down when perched, and have a fluttering ‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù display flight. They forage for insects, their staple diet, in low waterside vegetation.

BC (c. 1613 BC.) The exact origins of prayer beads remain uncertain, but their earliest historical use probably traces to Hindu prayers in India.Bead One, Pray Too by Kimberly Winston 2008 pages 4-10Linking Your Beads: The Rosary's History, Mysteries, and Prayers by Patricia Ann Kasten 2011 OSV Publishers pages 11-13 Buddhism probably borrowed the concept from Hinduism. The statue of a Hindu holy man with beads dates to the third century BC. Structure A misbaha, a device used for counting tasbih The number of beads varies by religion or use. Islamic prayer beads, called Misbaha or Tasbih, usually have 100 beads (99 +1 = 100 beads in total or 33 beads read thrice and +1). Buddhists and Hindus use the Japa Mala, which usually has 108 beads, or 27 which are counted four times. Bah√° º√≠ prayer beads consist of either 95 beads or 19 beads, which are strung with the addition of five beads below. The Sikh Mala also has 108 beads. Roman Catholics use the Rosary (Latin \\"rosarium\\", meaning \\"rose garden\\") with 59 beads. However, Eastern Orthodox Christians use a knotted prayer rope called either a komboskini or chotki, with 100 knots, although prayer ropes with 50 or 33 knots can also be used. In Vita of Saint Paul of Thebes (227 A.D. to 342 A.D.), written by Saint Jerome (347 A.D. to 420 A.D.) it states that Saint Paul of Thebes used pebbles and knotted cord to count prayers. Although Anglo-Catholics have used the Dominican rosary since the 19th century, in the 1980s Rev. Lynn Bauman from the Episcopal Church in the United States of America introduced a Rosary for Anglicans with 33 beads.Anglican Prayer Beads The Greek \\"komboloi\\" (which are worry beads and have no religious purpose) has an odd number of beads‚Äîusually one more than a multiple of four, e.g. (4x4)+1, (5x4)+1. Use Since the beads are fingered in an automatic manner, they allow the user to keep track of how many prayers have been said with a minimal amount of conscious effort, which in turn allows greater attention to the prayer itself. =Pre-Christianity= A fresco picture dating from 1600 B.C., recently discovered in Akrotiri of Santorini (ancient Thira), shows women handling a prayer rope of beads. =Christianity= The Desert Fathers of the 3rd to 5th centuries, used pebbles or knotted ropes to count prayers, typically the Jesus Prayer (\\"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner\\"). The invention is attributed to Anthony the Great or his associate Pachomius the Great in the 4th century. The Catholic Encyclopedia mentions strings of beads, presumably for prayer, found in the tombs of Saint Gertrude of Nivelles (7th century) and Saint Norbert and Saint Rosalia (12th century). A more explicit reference is that in 1125 William of Malmesbury mentioned a string of gems that Lady Godiva used to count prayers. These strings of beads were known as \\"paternosters\\" and were presumably used to count repetitions of the Lord's Prayer. Later, Roman Catholics and eventually Anglicans prayed the rosary with strings of 59 beads. The term rosary comes from the Latin rosarium \\"rose garden\\" and is an important and traditional devotion of the Catholic Church, combining prayer and meditation in sequences (called \\"decades\\") of the Lord's Prayer, 10 Hail Marys, and a Gloria Patri as well as a number of other prayers (such as the Apostles' Creed and the Salve Regina) at the beginning and end. The prayers are accompanied by meditation on the Mysteries, events in the life and ministry of Jesus. This traditional Catholic form of the rosary is attributed to Saint Dominic, though some Catholic writers have doubted this claim. Catholic rosary beads are composed of crucifix and center which can be made of sterling silver and/or gold, and beads which are usually made of glass, amethyst, rose quartz stone, crystal, black onyx, lavender glass or pearl,Prayer beads in Christianity Retrieved 18 December 2008 but all parts can be made of any material. Catholics also use prayer beads to pray chaplets. The Eastern Orthodox Church uses prayer ropes that usually come with 33, 50 or 100 knots. The loops of knotted wool (or occasionally of beads), called chotki or komboskini to pray the Jesus Prayer. Although among the Orthodox, their use is mainly restricted to monks and bishops, being less common among laity or secular clergy. Among Russian Old Believers, a prayer rope made of leather, called 'lestovka', is more common, although this type is no longer commonly used now by the Russian Orthodox Church. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, \\"The rosary is conferred upon the Greek Orthodox monk as a part of his investiture with the mandyas or full monastic habit, as the second step in monastic life, and is called his 'spiritual sword'.\\" Ethiopian and Coptic prayer rope (called mequetaria/mequteria) employ numbers such as 41, 64, and 100 as their length and is primarily used for reciting the Kyrie Eleison. In regards to the first two numbers, the former represent the number of wounds inflicted on Jesus from lashing, the nails, and the lance while the latter represents Mary's age upon her Assumption. In the mid-1980s, Anglican prayer beads or \\"Christian prayer beads\\" was developed in the Episcopal Church of the United States by Episcopalians participating in a study group dealing with methods of prayer. The set consists of 33 beads (representing the 33 years of the life of Christ) arranged in four groupings of symbolic significance. These \\"Anglican Rosaries\\" continue to be promoted via internet websites but it is not known whether they have been adopted by any Protestant group in any formal sense. Many Anglo-Catholics use the Catholic rosary and may also be using Anglican prayer beads. The contemporary Wreath of Christ,Pearls of Life Retrieved on 9 March 2010 invented by Martin L√∂nnebo, Bishop Emeritus of the Diocese of Link√∂ping of the Swedish Lutheran Church, is a set of 18 beads, some round and some elongated, arranged in an irregular pattern. Each one has its own significance as a stimulus and reminder for meditation, although they can also be used for repetitive prayer. While there are liturgical churches using prayer beads in prayer, non-liturgical Christian churches do not use them. Image:Komboskini 300 knots.jpgGreek Orthodox komboskini of 100 knots.

A Misbaha In Islam, prayer beads are referred to as Misbaha (Arabic: ŸÖÿ≥ÿ®ÿ≠ÿ© mas'baha ), Tasbih or Sibha and contain 99 normal-sized beads, (corresponding to the Names of God in Islam) and two smaller or mini beads separating every 33 beads. Sometimes only 33 beads are used, in which case one would cycle through them three times. The beads are traditionally used to keep count while saying the prayer. The prayer is considered a form of dhikr that involves the repetitive utterances of short sentences in the praise and glorification of Allah, in Islam. The prayer is recited as follows: 33 times \\"Subhan Allah\\" (Glory be to God), 33 times \\"Al-hamdu lilah\\" (Praise be to God), and 33 times \\"Allahu Akbar\\" (God is the greatest) which equals 99, the number of beads in the misbaha. To keep track of counting either the phalanges of the right hand or a misbaha is used. Use of the misbaha to count prayers and recitations is considered an acceptable practice within mainstream Islam. While they are widely used today in Sunni and Shia Islam, adherents of the Salafi sects shun them as an intolerable innovation. Ahmadiyya In the Ahmadiyya religion, misbaha and other forms of prayer beads are considered an \\"innovation\\". According to Mirza Tahir Ahmad of the Ahmadiyya community, the use of prayer beads is a form of innovation which was not practised by the early Muslim community =Sikhism= Sikh worshipers may use mala (prayer beads) while reciting verses from the Guru Granth Sahib. These prayer beads may be used as a part of the Sikh attire and worn around turbans or wrists. =Hinduism= Hindu Japa mala prayer beads, made from Tulasi wood, with the head bead in the foreground. An early use of prayer beads can be traced to Hinduism where they are called japa mala. Japa is the repeating of the name of a deity or a mantra. Mala ( ) means \\"garland\\" or \\"wreath\\". Indonesian rudraksha mala Japa mala are used for repetition of a mantra, for other forms of sƒÅdhanƒÅ or \\"spiritual exercise\\" and as an aid to meditation. The most common mala have 108 beads. The most common materials used for making the beads are Rudraksha seeds (used by Shaivites) and Ocimum tenuiflorum (tulsi) stems (used by Vaishnavites). According to Vedic scriptures 103 beads were used during Treta Yuga, 108 beads during Dvapara Yuga, and 111 beads in Kali Yuga. According to Hindu Sashtras there must be 108 beads must be there. Generally for meditation rudraksha beads, Lotus seed are used. =Buddhism= Japanese Zen Buddhist prayer beads (Juzu). Prayer beads (, , (yeomju), ) are also used in many forms of Mahayana Buddhism, often with a lesser number of beads (usually a divisor of 108). In Pure Land Buddhism, for instance, 27-bead malas are common. These shorter malas are sometimes called \\"prostration rosaries\\" because they are easier to hold when enumerating repeated prostrations. In Tibetan Buddhism malas are also 108 beads: one mala counts as 100 mantras, and the eight extra are meant to be dedicated to all sentient beings (the practice as a whole is dedicated at its end as well). In Tibetan Buddhism, often larger malas are used; for example, malas of 111 beads. When counting, they calculate one mala as 100 mantras and the 11 additional beads are taken as extra to compensate for errors. Various type of materials are used to make mala beads such as seeds of the rudraksha, beads made from the wood of the tulsi plant, animal bone, wood or seeds from the Bodhi Tree (a particularly sacred tree of the species Ficus religiosa) or of Nelumbo nucifera (the lotus plant). Semi-precious stones like carnelian and amethyst are also used. Another commonly used material is sandalwood.Prayer beads in Buddhism Retrieved 18 December 2008 Antique Chinese Buddhist Qinan prayer beads (Ni√†nzh≈´), Qing Dynasty, 19th century, China. Adilnor Collection, Sweden =The Bah√°‚Äô√≠ Faith= Bah√° º√≠ prayer beads in a 19 bead, 5 set counter configuration. The Bah√° º√≠ Faith stipulates that the verse All√°h-u-Abh√° \\"God the All-Glorious\\" be recited 95 times daily after the performance of ablutions. To help facilitate this recitation Bah√°‚Äô√≠s often use prayer beads, though they are not required to.

It is the flagship property of publicly traded GMA Network, Inc. Its first broadcast on television was on October 29, 1961. GMA Network (formerly known as Republic Broadcasting System, GMA Radio- Television Arts and GMA Rainbow Satellite Network) is commonly referred to as the \\"Kapuso Network\\" in reference to the outline of the company's logo. It is headquartered in the GMA Network Center in Quezon City and its transmitter, Tower of Power, is located at Tandang Sora Avenue, Barangay Culiat also in Quezon City. The original meaning of the GMA acronym was Greater Manila Area, referring to the initial coverage area of the station. As the network expanded it changed into Global Media Arts. GMA's flagship television station is DZBB- TV which carries VHF Channel 7 (analog broadcast) and UHF Channel 15 (digital broadcast). The network has 4 originating stations and 48 relay stations nationwide. Its programming is also available outside the Philippines through GMA Pinoy TV, GMA Life TV and GMA News TV International. History =1950s and 1960s= The origin of GMA Network can be traced back to Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc. through DZBB,GMA Network Corporate Information , GMANetwork.com which started airing its radio broadcast on March 1, 1950, and officially launched as a local radio station in Manila on June 14, 1950 and owned by Robert La Rue \\"Uncle Bob\\" Stewart, an American war correspondent.GMA Gold: Fifty Years of Broadcast History, Chelo Banal Formoso (ed.), GMA Network. Venturing into television in the 1960s, Stewart started RBS TV Channel 7 (under the call letters DZBB-TV) on October 29, 1961, becoming the Philippines' fifth terrestrial television station. Originally, RBS's programming was composed of foreign programs from the United States and it later produced local programs to cater to Filipino audiences. It produced shows like Uncle Bob's Lucky Seven Club, a child-oriented show aired every Saturdays; Dance Time with Chito; and various news programs like News at Seven. In 1963, RBS launched its first provincial television station in Cebu, DYSS Channel 7 (now GMA Cebu). In the same year, from Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc, the firm was formally renamed to Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. (RBS). =1970s= On September 21, 1972, then President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law by the virtue of Proclamation 1081. Marcos, ruling by decree, curtailed press freedom and other civil liberties; closed down the Congress and media establishments including RBS. In December 1972, RBS was given the green light by the government to return on the air, however with limited three-month permits. Programming during that time was supplied mostly via a blocktime agreement with Philippine Production Center Inc. (PPCI), a company led by former ABS-CBN executive Romeo Jalosjos. But due to limited licenses, difficulty in financial obligations, and disallowing foreign citizens and entities from owning and operating media companies in the Philippines, Stewart and the American Broadcasting Company, who owned a quarter of the company, was forced to cede majority control to a triumvirate composed of Gilberto Duavit Sr., a Malaca√±ang official; Menardo Jimenez, an accountant; and Felipe Gozon, an attorney of the Stewarts in 1974; and the station changed its name to GMA Radio-Television Arts (GMA stood for Greater Manila Area, the station's initial coverage area); though Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. remained as its corporate name until 1996. His wife Loring was the president when the takeover ensued.What's the story, Pinoy TV?, Ellen Joy Anastacio and Janine Natalie Badiola, GMA Network. The relaunched GMA, aside from sporting a light blue square logo with the network name in white, also (until 1980) had a circle 7 logo in use, in its final years the blue circle 7 logo used was similar to those used by the ABC in some United States cities. After that, Rod Reyes, the then-general manager of RBS recruited old-timers from ABS-CBN, including from the news department and entertainment programs. Through the acquisition, the station was able to broadcast in color with an ‚Ç±8 million credit line thru buying telecine machines and acquired foreign programs. Ratings were up from #5 to #3 that time. =1980s= When Benigno \\"Ninoy\\" Aquino, Jr., a senator who strongly opposed the Marcos administration, was assassinated on August 21, 1983, it was only a small item on television news. The iron grip that the Marcos administration had on television began to slip, as GMA broadcast the funeral, the only local station to do so. In 1984, Imee Marcos, daughter of Ferdinand Marcos, attempted to take over GMA. However, the takeover was prevented by GMA executives. Stewart left the Philippines for good as he was utterly disappointed with the Marcos move. GMA was also instrumental during the years preceding the People Power Revolution. The network was the first to air a television interview with Corazon Aquino via Viewpoint in 1984, and when she later announced that she would run for the presidency if she receives one million signatures. In February 1986, the network was also the first to report that Fidel Ramos and Juan Ponce Enrile broke away from the Marcos administration. GMA's rival ABS-CBN reopened in September 1986 and convinced GMA's then-Executive Vice President Freddie Garcia to transfer networks, along with key people from the network's Marketing and Engineering departments but the network continued to operate. When democracy in the Philippines was restored in the People Power Revolution in 1986, television stations began to air, some with their original owners. The political instability of the country also added to the station's burden, when soldiers stormed into the studios for two days in a part of coup attempt to topple then president, Corazon Aquino. In 1987, it became the first VHF television network in the country to provide a new dimension to viewers by broadcasting the network's programs in full stereo (dubbed as GMA StereoVision), it opened its high-end live studio, the Broadway Centrum, boosting its local programming, and inaugurated its 777-foot Tower of Power located along Tandang Sora, Quezon City, the tallest man-made structure in the country on November 7, 1988.Pres. Aquino switched GMA-7's 'Power Tower , Manila Standards, November 7, 1988 =1990s= On March 20, 1992, Congress passed Republic Act No. 7252, otherwise known as \\"An Act Granting the Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. A Franchise to Construct, Install, Operate and Maintain Radio and Television Broadcasting Stations in the Philippines,\\" granting GMA a legislative franchise for the operation of radio and television broadcasting stations, in particular, \\"to construct, install, operate and maintain for commercial purposes and in the public interest, radio and television broadcasting stations in the Philippines with the corresponding auxiliary, special broadcast and other program and distribution services and relay stations, and to install radio communications facilities for private use in its broadcast services\\" for a period of 25 years. This law became effective on May 12, 1992-fifteen (15) days after it was published in the Official Gazette on April 27, 1992. Under Jimenez, Gozon and Executive Vice President Antonio C. Barreiro, international reach became GMA's target in the 1990s, which began when the Rainbow Satellite launched on April 26, 1992. Through its relay stations, GMA programs were seen across the archipelago and Southeast Asia. GMA programming started airing in 60 American cities and parts of South America through the International Channel Network. GMA was the official broadcaster of the 1995 World Youth Day, which was the last visit of Pope John Paul II to the country. During the same year, two popular TV shows, Eat Bulaga! and Okay Ka, Fairy Ko! began broadcasting on GMA after TAPE Inc. refused ABS-CBN's proposal to buy the airing rights of the two shows. At the same time, GMA launched a UHF channel subsidiary, Citynet 27, several new shows (among them was Bubble Gang one of the longest-running shows on TV today), and the news program, Saksi with Mike Enriquez, Mel Tiangco and Karen Davila. It also has the Asian adaptation of The 700 Club series as The 700 Club Asia which the Philippines is the only originating country in Asia. In 1995, GMA founded its film production company, Cinemax Studios (later renamed to GMA Films in 1998) with the film Run Barbi Run. Its film Jos√© Rizal released in 1998, which was at that time the most expensive movie production ever in the country (costing over 80 million pesos to produce), became a huge success with many accolades and award nominations. On May 16, 1996, GMA formally changed its corporate name to GMA Network Incorporated, with GMA now standing for Global Media Arts. GoBingo, initially aired in 1996, is an interactive game show hosted by Arnell Ignacio, with Maricar de Mesa as the first GobiGirl. In 1998, GMA pioneered on Filipino language late night news broadcast with the news program GMA Network News as the first Filipino- language late-night television newscast after it was debuted six years ago as an English-language late-night newscast, as English newscasts were started since the introduction of television in the country in 1953. As the newscast fasten to higher than its English newscasts, all networks start to follow including IBC in 1998, ABS-CBN in 1999, RPN in 2000, NBN (now PTV) in 2001 and ABC (now TV5) in 2004. GMA was the first Philippine broadcaster to receive a Peabody Award for Investigative Reporting in 1999.59th Annual Peabody Awards , May 2000. Later, Citynet 27 became EMC, the first locally programmed music video channel, later becoming a part of the Channel V franchise called Channel V Philippines. Channel V the Philippines, however, ceased operations due to a conflict of interest between the owners of GMA and PLDT (which bought a stake in GMA), who operate MTV Philippines through their subsidiary, the Nation Broadcasting Corporation. GMA was also the Philippine broadcaster for 2000 Today, the most-successful international television special that commemorated the dawn of the new millennium. At the turn of the millennium, GMA was the only local network to go on 24-hour, non-stop broadcasting (However, in 2001, the network reduced back to regular broadcast hours for its regular transmitter maintenance due to NTC's rules and regulations for affiliated free-to-air TV stations). At the beginning of the year, Menardo Jimenez announced his retirement as president and CEO (he would later be assumed office as a member of the board of directors of San Miguel Corporation in 2002) and on December 31, 2000, Felipe Gozon assumed the position with his concurrent capacity as chairman. Duavit's son Gilberto Duavit Jr. assumed the post of the chief operating officer. =2000s= On October 27, 2002, during an episode of the network's noontime show SOP, GMA officially revealed a new logo and image campaign. The new logo features a rainbow-colored heart-shaped logo, the Kapuso, represented by a new slogan \\"Kapuso ng Pamilyang Pilipino, Anumang Kulay ng Buhay\\" (\\"One in Heart With the Filipino family, In Whatever Colors of Life\\"), and a Century Gothic Bold font for the letters. The \\"Kapuso\\" theme song is sung by Regine Velasquez. View of GMA Network Center from Kamuning MRT Station In 2003, Saksi won the New York Television Festival Gold Medal for best newscast, the first Philippine newscast to do so. This and the Peabody Award in 1999 earned the network a House of Representatives commendation later that year. On September 1 of the same year, GMA Network withdrew its membership from the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP), after incidents involving host Rosanna Roces, alleged commercial overloading and interfering when news anchor Mike Enriquez aired his complaints about his radio program, Saksi sa Dobol B, against Lopez-owned cable firm Sky Cable's distortion of GMA's signal on its system, and a lost videotape containing evidence that the cable firm had violated the rule on soliciting ads for cable TV. GMA was an official TV network of the 4th World Meeting of Families held in Manila, Philippines. In 2004, GMA launched line up of new programs and primetime shows such as Te Amo, Maging Sino Ka Man, Hanggang Kailan, Forever in My Heart, Marinara, as well as, Bahay Mo Ba 'To?, Naks!, Lovely Day, StarStruck Kids, Ikaw sa Puso Ko, Leya, ang Pinakamagandang Babae sa Ilalim ng Lupa, 30 Days, Wag Kukurap, Pinoy Pop Superstar, SOP Gigsters, Joyride, 3R, Out, Bitoy's Funniest Videos and the network's new early evening newscast 24 Oras. In 2005, the company's subsidiary, Citynet Network Marketing and Productions, Inc., signed a co-production and block time agreement with ZOE Broadcasting Network, allowing the GMA Network with another platform to showcase its programming and talents. On November 11, 2005, ZOE's flagship station, DZOE-TV Channel 11, went on the air as Quality TeleVision (later known as Q and was reformatted to become GMA News TV), and broadcast shows that primarily targeted women audiences. Q's news programs shared the same resources of GMA News and Public Affairs, while some programs are produced by Citynet Network Marketing and Productions, Inc. Also in 2005, GMA won the Asian Television Awards' Best Terrestrial Television Station, besting MBC of Korea and Mediacorp Channel 5 of Singapore. The network planned to go public, but due to political instability and the downward trend of broadcast advertising, it was delayed. In 2006, Debate with Mare at Pare, a late-night public affairs program, won the bronze medal in the New York Television Festival. The network was also praised on its coverage of the Wowowee (a program of ABS-CBN) stampede by local publications. In an exclusive interview, a reprehensive Mike Enriquez interviewed embattled Philippine president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, for the first time since the lifting of the State of National Emergency, which the network allowed other stations to air without prior consent.

Digital terrestrial television In February 2013, GMA Network admitted that it was conducting field tests of Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting- Terrestrial (ISDB-T), the Japanese standard in digital television on UHF Channel 27 (551.143 MHz), but remained unconvinced saying European standard, second-generation Digital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial (DVB-T2), is superior to ISDB-T. However, in October 2013, National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) issued a draft memorandum circular adopting the Japanese standard as the sole standard in the delivery of digital terrestrial TV (DTT) services in the Philippines. In May 2015, GMA Network announced that it will be spending at least ‚Ç±2 to 3 billion for the rollout of its digital TV service and said the company plans to produce dongles, instead of set-top boxes for the rollout. In May 2015, GMA topped the digital TV test commissioned by mobile phone brand Starmobile and conducted by American market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) with GMA's presence in 10 out of 14 locations in Metro Manila. Beginning September 2013, some of the programs of the network have been produced in high-definition format in preparation for the ongoing digital shift in the country while keeping digital on-screen graphics in 4:3 safe zone for their TV broadcast since the network is still broadcasting in 480i. The videos uploaded on their YouTube channel and third-party OTT services on the other hand are presented in 720p and 1080p format. In December 2016, it was announced that the network will spend an initial amount of ‚Ç±416 million for the commencement of the Digital Terrestrial Television transition project of GMA, which included the purchase of three high-powered transmitters capable for providing wider and clearer signal to digital television boxes, antennae and other connectivity requirements, and a fully mirrored head-end system, which is a master facility for grouping and digitally encoding programs. According to GMA Network Chairman and CEO, Felipe Gozon, the network will conclude the test phase, and it is expected to begin the rollout of the DTTV project starting in Metro Manila. In preparation for the shift to digital, GMA New Media was working on a DTV set-top box (originally reported to be a DTV dongle) in order to compete with ABS-CBN's TV Plus set-top box. A prototype was shown at the IMMAP DigiCon congress in 2016, and is shown to be running a version of Android, double-acting as a streaming device capable of running apps and games. In June 2020, images of a DTV set-top box known as the GMA Affordabox surfaced online. The product is said to be priced at under ‚Ç±1000 and includes a multimedia player, a personal video recorder, and support for the Philippines' emergency broadcast warning system with an auto-on alert feature. The GMA Affordabox became available on Lazada and Shopee that same month with a final price tag of ‚Ç±888. On February 22, 2019, GMA Network announced that they will be investing ‚Ç±1 billion for the second phase of its digitization project.

Branding =Network identity= On October 29, 1961, Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc. launches its first television station in the Philippines, known back then as RBS TV Channel 7. GMA Network began branding its identity by eliminating call signs to its network identification. :*RBS TV Channel 7 (1961‚Äì1974) ‚Äì From the success of its amplitude modulation band radio DZBB, Robert La Rue \\"Uncle Bob\\" Stewart launches its first television and the Philippines' fifth terrestrial channel, RBS TV Channel 7. :* GMA Radio- Television Arts (1974‚Äì1992) ‚Äì To ascertain its presence in its coverage area, the Greater Manila Area, RBS changed its name to GMA Radio-Television Arts after the takeover by the new management. :* GMA Rainbow Satellite Network (Rainbow Network, 1992‚Äì1995) ‚Äì When the network launched its satellite to widen its coverage area, GMA again rebranded its network identity on April 26, 1992. :* GMA Network (Rainbow Network, 1995‚Äì2002) ‚Äì In preparation for the 45th year of responsible broadcasting, GMA Rainbow Satellite changed to GMA Network. :* GMA Network (Kapuso Network, 2002‚Äìpresent) ‚Äì On October 27, 2002, GMA Network unveiled its new identity and catchphrase. In an effort to localize and transform its image into a more intrinsic Filipino network, GMA Network engaged in a rebranding course. =Logos= GMA Network has used a number of logos throughout its history especially when Gozon, Jimenez, and Duavit acquired the station in 1975. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, the network used the Circle 7 logo for its Metro Manila and Cebu stations, which is also expended by several networks around the world (predominately the O&O; stations of ABC in the United States). In the 1980s, to refine its presence in the Philippine broadcast industry, GMA Network used the slogan Where You Belong, and lasted for two decades before invigorating to another catchphrase. In 1992, GMA Network redefines itself as the Rainbow Network, succeeding the ensigns of the rainbow. Throughout the 1990s, the network developed the logo before having it replaced by its current logo in 2002 and as the Kapuso Network. After a huge marketing campaign, and improved television ratings, the new insignia (the rainbow-colored stylized heart-shape logo known as Kapuso) is now one of the most recognizable in the Philippines. =Slogans= Kapuso ng Bawat Pilipino (One in Heart with Every Filipino) is the secondary characteristic catchphrase of GMA Network. The slogan was initially used in conjunction with the rebranding of GMA Network as the Kapuso Network on October 27, 2002. (Currently, it is used in its Regional TV stations). But another slogan of the network Kapuso, Anumang Kulay ng Buhay (One in Heart, in Every Colors of Life) is still used in other purposes and this is the official theme song title for the network. GMA Network's news and public affairs department meanwhile uses the slogan Serbisyong Totoo (True Service) It is one of the longest running slogans used for news broadcast promotion. GMA Network found itself on the other end of a battle concerning the slogan, when ABS-CBN News Channel uses similar catchphrase, and immediately discontinued in order to avoid legal predicament from GMA Network. In 2006, its news department also used an accompanying slogan, Just News, for its promotional campaign together with its news media partners, INQ7.Net. In 2019, the Network introduced a new corporate slogan, Buong Puso Para Sa Kapuso (Wholehearted for the One in Heart) which presented GMA's effort to bring programs, relevant shows, multi-awarded newscasts and documentaries and other services through TV, radio and online format from its birth to the present time, from the Philippines and abroad. In 2020, a variation of the current slogan Buong Puso Para Sa Pilipino (Wholehearted for the Filipino) was unveiled on its 70th anniversary. It is currently shown on programming promo plugs of the network on TV and its Social Media channels, and Buong Puso Para Sa Pinoy Abroad (Wholehearted for the Filipino Abroad) for celebrating GMA Pinoy TV's 15th anniversary.

In 2007, GMA Network started producing the local version of a Mexican television series MariMar. For its pilot episode, it got 52.6 percent overnight rating, making it the only soap opera to achieve the highest ratings in GMA Network's history. In a 2006 survey conducted by Pulse Asia, seven out of 10 Metro Manila-based viewers find GMA Network a more credible network than its competitor. GMA Network managed to lead in Mega Manila and Southern Luzon demographic, which has the highest concentration of television ownership and 79 percent of advertisement placement. The National Urban Television Audience Measurement was officially launched on October 16, 2006, to determine the television ratings and the audience share of local TV programs from urban areas in the Philippines. This changes the broadcast industry landscape and the manner in which the advertisers allocate their TV investments to achieve cost efficiency and maximization. In August 2007 audience rating data shows GMA Network maintained its lead in Mega Manila, which resulted to a 23 percent growth in its consolidated net income to ‚Ç±1.13 billion in the first half of the year from ‚Ç±915 million in the same period last year.GMA Network posts PhP1.13-B net income in 1st half, up 23% , Manila Bulletin, n.d.

It got 37.7 percent share over ABS-CBN 25.2 percent and TV5's 17.7 percent, 20 points higher. Controversies =Copyright infringement with ABS-CBN= On July 22, 2004, Breaking news during the arrival of Angelo de la Cruz at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (a truck driver who was held hostage and threatened with beheading in Iraq abducted by armed rebels west of Baghdad while trucking fuel from Saudi Arabia), live news coverage was aired on GMA Network and other local television stations in the Philippines. GMA Network used audio-video coverage through the facilities of Reuters, which GMA Network subscribed to. During the said broadcast, a live feed from Reuters was simultaneously aired with its own live broadcast. During the first five-second of the live feed, GMA Network did notice that the live feed from Reuters was also airing at another local station, its main competitor ABS-CBN. The live video was restricted only to ABS-CBN and Reuters did not inform GMA Network that the video coverage was only intended for ABS-CBN. The local Court of Appeals junked the case filed by ABS-CBN Corporation against GMA Network Inc. for what was claimed to be illegal copying of its live video footage. In a ruling, the local fourth division of the appellate court set aside the resolution of the local Justice Department, which approved the filing of the violation of Republic Act 8293 (or the Intellectual Property Code) against GMA Network. It ruled out that the act of GMA Network in airing the live video coverage was focused by good faith since there was no meaning to instigate damage to ABS-CBN Corporation. The local court also said GMA Network acted in good faith when it decided to instantaneously stop using the live video feed from Reuters upon learning ABS-CBN was also covering the said news event and its following exertion to authenticate the ABS-CBN Corporation restriction arrangement with the news service, Reuters. The local court also stressed that apart from lack of intent of GMA Network to affect the video from ABS-CBN, the action also cannot be reflected intrusion of Sections 212.4 and 185.1 of Republic Act 8293 since it was just a short excerpt compared with the totality of the matter. =TV ratings= On December 20, 2007, Judge Charito Gonzales of Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 80 released a temporary restraining order on TV ratings surveys based on a civil case filed by then ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation (now ABS-CBN Corporation) versus AGB Nielsen Media Research Philippines. ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation accused competitor GMA Network Inc. of funding bribing operations in Bacolod City, to discredit the former. The local court in the Philippines further ordered ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation to file comment on the plea of AGB Nielsen Media Research Philippines for the alleged gathering and dissemination of television ratings data, within five days or until December 22, 2007. On December 21, 2007, a local AM radio station in the Philippines, owned by ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation, DZMM field reporter Junrie Hidalgo reported a news story entitled \\"AGB Nielsen, umamin sa dayaan: GMA Network, tahasang itinurong nasa likod ng dayaan\\" (AGB Nielsen admits to cheating: GMA Network aggressively accused of being behind the cheating) during the radio program of Showbiz Mismo, hosted by Cristy Fermin and Jobert Sucaldito. The news story is based on an interview of AGB Nielsen general manager Maya Reforma regarding the purported cheating. In response, GMA Network Inc. aired a television plug reproving the purported unfair journalism and disagreed the accusations of ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation. GMA Network Inc. later filed a ‚Ç±15 million civil libel suit against ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation on January 3, 2008. The respondents included Hidalgo, Fermin, Sucaldito, the station and news manager of DZMM, writers and executive producers of television programs Bandila, Entertainment Live and The Buzz after the same story was aired locally. On January 7, 2008, the Quezon City Regional Trial Court junked ABS- CBN Broadcasting Corporation's suit against AGB Nielsen, saying the case was \\"prematurely filed\\" before the local court. Judge Gonzales' basis is the principle of mutuality of contracts, citing Article 1308 and 1196, New Civil Code of the Philippines. Also, Judge Samuel Gaerlan, Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 92 issued court summons against ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation and 15 of its personnel on January 3, 2008. On January 17, 2008, Judge Gaerlan recused himself from the case, considering that he has a cousin working in the legal department of ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation. The case was later re-raffled on January 28, 2008, and the case was eventually assigned to Judge Henri Inting of Branch 95 of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court. On February 14, 2008, Judge Inting issued a temporary restraining order barring local television station, ABS-CBN from airing defamatory statements against GMA Network Inc. =Lawsuit against TV5= In December 2008, GMA Network Inc., Citynet Television, and ZOE Broadcasting Network filed a lawsuit against the management of TV5, alleging MPB Primedia Inc. (a subsidiary of Media Prima Berhad, a Malaysian company, which entered a block time agreement with Associated Broadcasting Company to sell the airtime of TV5) of violating Article XVI, Section 3, of the 1987 Philippine Constitution. GMA Network Inc. argues restriction of foreign entities to operate and own a Filipino company especially on broadcast media. GMA Network Inc. disputes MPB Primedia Inc. that it was established to skirt the anti-dummy laws and enter into an unlawful block time deal.

Also operating over this route was the Ann Rutledge, which originated in Chicago. In January 2009, Amtrak consolidated these trains under the name Missouri River Runner.  History  Amtrak introduced the two trains on October 26, 1980, in partnership with the state of Missouri, which provided a yearly subsidy of $484,000. It ran along a route that had been served for most of the 20th century by the Missouri Pacific Railroad. In July 1971, the route became the western leg of Amtrak's National Limited, which ran from New York City to Kansas City. That train, in turn, was the successor of the famed Spirit of St. Louis, which had run from 1927 to 1971. The National Limited was discontinued due to budget cuts in 1979, reducing service along the St. Louis-Kansas City corridor to just one train, the Ann Rutledge, which ran from Chicago to Kansas City via St. Louis. Missouri officials wanted to maintain the same level of service between the state's two major cities, and urged Amtrak to preserve a regional service for the state to supplement the Ann Rutledge. Although the two trains shared the same route, the eastbound train was known as the St. Louis Mule while the westbound train was called the Kansas City Mule. Contemporary news accounts referred to the combined service as the \\"Missouri Mule\\", although Amtrak timetables used the individual names. The Mules originally stopped at Kirkwood, Jefferson City, Sedalia and Warrensburg. Amtrak added Lee's Summit and Washington as flag stops in April 1981 on a one- year trial basis; Lee's Summit was retained in 1982 while Washington was dropped late 1981 in favor of Independence. Amtrak reinstated Washington on the October 29, 1995 timetable for another one-year trial period; this time Amtrak retained the stop. Hermann became a permanent stop on September 28, 1991. Trains had previously stopped only during Hermann's annual Maifest and Octoberfest. Between April 29, 1984 and November 4, 1993 the Mules operated with the River Cities, a Kansas City section of the City of New Orleans. Eastbound trains split from the St. Louis Mule and continued to Carbondale, Illinois to connect with the New Orleans-bound train. Westbound trains split from the northbound City of New Orleans at Carbondale and continued to St. Louis, where they joined the Kansas City Mule. A funding crisis caused Amtrak to discontinue the Mules between April 1 and July 1, 1995. Because the tracks were owned by Union Pacific (UP), which acquired MoPac in 1983, freight trains had priority over passenger trains. This often resulted in severe delays for Amtrak, such as those seen in May 2007, when the Missouri Department of Transportation blamed UP for the disruptions.kansascity.com [broken link]  References   External links  *2008 timetable: Kansas City Mule *2008 timetable: St. Louis Mule Category:Former Amtrak routes Category:Passenger rail transportation in Missouri Category:Railway services introduced in 1980 Category:Railway services discontinued in 2009 ","title":"Mules (train)"},{"id":"2198654","text":"Sharaf Rashidovich Rashidov (Uzbek Cyrillic:–®–∞—Ä–∞—Ñ –†–∞—à–∏–¥–æ–≤–∏—á –†–∞—à–∏–¥–æ–≤ Sharaf Rashidovich Rashidov; Russian: –®–∞—Ä–∞—Ñ –†–∞—à–∏–¥–æ–≤–∏—á –†–∞—à–∏–¥–æ–≤ Sharaf Rashidovich Rashidov) ( ‚Äì 31 October 1983) was a Communist Party leader in the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic and a CPSU Central Committee Politbureau candidate member between 1961 and 1983. Born the day before the Russian Revolution to a poor peasant family in Jizzakh, Uzbekistan, Sharaf Rashidov worked as a teacher, journalist and editor for a Samarkand newspaper. He returned home in 1942 with wounds suffered on the German front in World War 2. He became head of the Uzbekistan Writers Union in 1949, and was elected to the post of Chairman of the Praesidium of the Uzbek Supreme Soviet in 1950. In 1959, he became First Secretary of the Uzbek Communist Party, a post he held to his death in 1983. In the Soviet Union his name became synonymous with corruption, nepotism and the Great Cotton Scandal of the late Brezhnev period. As orders from Moscow to grow increasing quantities of cotton, the Uzbek government responded by reporting miraculous growth in land irrigated and harvested, and record improvements in production and efficiency. Today it would seem that most of these records were falsified. The Uzbek leadership used these exaggerated figures to transfer substantial amounts of wealth from central Soviet funds into Uzbekistan. Rashidov died on 31 October 1983 in Jizzakh. Immediately after his death, rumors spread that he had realized he was about to be disgraced and thus committed suicide. However, this has never been confirmed. Sharof Rashidov Street in Tashkent. During the decade following the death of Rashidov, Moscow attempted to regain the central control over the Uzbek SSR, which had weakened in the previous decade. In 1986, it was announced that almost the entire party and government leadership of the republic had conspired in falsifying cotton production figures. A massive purge of the Uzbek leadership was carried out, with prosecutors brought in from Moscow, leading to widespread arrests, executions, and suicides. It may never be known how high the corruption extended, as Brezhnev's own son-in-law, Yuri Churbanov was implicated in the affair. In the rest of the Soviet Union, Uzbekistan became synonymous with corruption even though such corruption was widespread throughout the whole Union. After Uzbekistan's independence, Rashidov re-emerged as a national hero. He is seen in Uzbekistan as having been a strong leader who found a way to cleverly defy Moscow and \\"beat the system\\" while managing to create a situation where Uzbekistan became quite autonomous of central control.

The cell body is shown in orange and the flagellum is in red. 84 pixels/Œºm. Trypanosoma brucei is a species of parasitic kinetoplastid belonging to the genus Trypanosoma. The parasite is the cause of a vector- borne disease of vertebrate animals, including humans, carried by genera of tsetse fly in sub-Saharan Africa. In humans T. brucei causes African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness. In animals it causes animal trypanosomiasis, also called nagana in cattle and horses. T. brucei has traditionally been grouped into three subspecies: T. b. brucei, T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense. The first is a parasite of non-human vertebrates, while the latter two are the known parasites of humans. Only rarely can the T. b. brucei infect a human. T. brucei is transmitted between mammal hosts by an insect vector belonging to different species of tsetse fly (Glossina). Transmission occurs by biting during the insect's blood meal. The parasites undergo complex morphological changes as they move between insect and mammal over the course of their life cycle. The mammalian bloodstream forms are notable for their cell surface proteins, variant surface glycoproteins, which undergo remarkable antigenic variation, enabling persistent evasion of host adaptive immunity leading to chronic infection. T. brucei is one of only a few pathogens known to cross the blood brain barrier. There is an urgent need for the development of new drug therapies, as current treatments can have severe side effects and can prove fatal to the patient. Whilst not historically regarded as T. brucei subspecies due to their different means of transmission, clinical presentation, and loss of kinetoplast DNA, genetic analyses reveal that T. equiperdum and T. evansi are evolved from parasites very similar to T. b. brucei, and are thought to be members of the brucei clade. The parasite was discovered in 1894 by Sir David Bruce, after whom the scientific name was given in 1899. Species T. brucei comprises a species complex that includes: *T. brucei gambiense ‚Äì Causes slow onset chronic trypanosomiasis in humans. Most common in central and western Africa, where humans are thought to be the primary reservoir. *T. brucei rhodesiense ‚Äì Causes fast onset acute trypanosomiasis in humans. Most common in southern and eastern Africa, where game animals and livestock are thought to be the primary reservoir. *T. brucei brucei ‚Äì Causes animal trypanosomiasis, along with several other species of Trypanosoma. T. b. brucei is not infective to humans due to its susceptibility to lysis by trypanosome lytic factor-1 (TLF-1). However, it is closely related to, and shares fundamental features with the human-infective subspecies. Structure  T. brucei is a typical unicellular eukaryotic cell, and measures 8 to 50 Œºm in length. It has an elongated body having a streamlined and tapered shape. Its cell membrane (called pellicle) encloses the cell organelles, including the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and ribosomes. In addition, there is an unusual organelle called the kinetoplast, which is made up of numerous circular DNA (mitochondrial DNA) and functions as a single large mitochondrion. The kinetoplast lies near the basal body with which it is indistinguishable under microscope. From the basal body arises a single flagellum that run towards the anterior end. Along the body surface, the flagellum is attached to the cell membrane forming an undulating membrane. Only the tip of the flagellum is free at the anterior end. The cell surface of the bloodstream form features a dense coat of variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) which is replaced by an equally dense coat of procyclins when the parasite differentiates into the procylic in the tsetse fly midgut. The six main morphologies of trypanosomatids. The different life cycle stages of Trypanosoma brucei fall into the trypomastigote and epimastigote morphological categories. Trypanosomatids show several different classes of cellular organisation of which two are adopted by Trypanosoma brucei at different stages of the life cycle: *Epimastigote, which is found in tsetse fly. Its kinetoplast and basal body lie anterior to the nucleus, with a long flagellum attached along the cell body. The flagellum starts from the centre of the body. *Trypomastigote, which is found in mammalian hosts. The kinetoplast and basal body are posterior of nucleus. The flagellum arises from the posterior end of the body. Trypanosoma Brucei flagellar structure. These names are derived from the Greek mastig- meaning whip, referring to the trypanosome's whip-like flagellum. The trypanosome flagellum has two main structures. It is made up of a typical flagellar axoneme, which lies parallel to the paraflagellar rod, a lattice structure of proteins unique to the kinetoplastida, euglenoids and dinoflagellates. The microtubules of the flagellar axoneme lie in the normal 9+2 arrangement, orientated with the + at the anterior end and the ‚àí in the basal body. The cytoskeletal structure extends from the basal body to the kinetoplast. The flagellum is bound to the cytoskeleton of the main cell body by four specialised microtubules, which run parallel and in the same direction to the flagellar tubulin. The flagellar function is twofold‚Äîlocomotion via oscillations along the attached flagellum and cell body, and attachment to the fly gut during the procyclic phase. Life cycle Life cycle of the Trypanosoma brucei T. brucei completes its life cycle between tsetse fly (of the genus Glossina) and mammalian hosts, including humans, cattle, horses, and wild animals. =In mammalian host= Infection occurs when a vector tsetse fly bites a mammalian host. The fly injects the metacyclic trypomastigotes into the skin tissue. The trypomastigotes enter the lymphatic system and into the bloodstream. The initial trypomastigotes are short and stumpy. Once inside the bloodstream, they grow into long and slender forms. Then, they multiply by binary fission. The daughter cells then become short and stumpy again. The long slender forms are able to penetrate the blood vessel endothelium and invade extravascular tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). Sometimes, wild animals can be infected by the tsetse fly and they act as reservoirs. In these animals, they do not produce the disease, but the live parasite can be transmitted back to the normal hosts. =In tsetse fly= The short and stumpy trypomastigotes are taken up by tsetse fly during blood meal. The trypomastigotes enter the midgut of the fly where they become procyclic trypomastigotes. These rapidly divide to become epimastigotes. The epimastigotes migrate from the gut via the proventriculus to the salivary glands where they get attached to the salivary gland epithelium. In the salivary glands, some parasites detach and undergo transformation into short and stumpy trypomastigotes. These become the infective metacyclic trypomastigotes. They are injected into the mammalian host along with the saliva on biting. Complete development in the fly takes about 20 days. Reproduction =Binary fission= Trypanosome cell cycle (procyclic form). The reproduction of T. brucei is unusual compared to most eukaryotes. The nuclear membrane remains intact and the chromosomes do not condense during mitosis. The basal body, unlike the centrosome of most eukaryotic cells, does not play a role in the organisation of the spindle and instead is involved in division of the kinetoplast. The events of reproduction are: #The basal body duplicates and both remain associated with the kinetoplast. Each basal body forms a separate flagellum. #Kinetoplast DNA undergoes synthesis then the kinetoplast divides coupled with separation of the two basal bodies. #Nuclear DNA undergoes synthesis while a new flagellum extends from the younger, more posterior, basal body. #The nucleus undergoes mitosis. #Cytokinesis progresses from the anterior to posterior. #Division completes with abscission. =Meiosis= In the 1980s, DNA analyses of the developmental stages of T. brucei started to indicate that the trypomastigote in the tsetse fly undergoes meiosis, i.e. a sexual reproduction stage. But it is not always necessary for a complete life cycle. The existence of meiosis-specific proteins was reported in 2011. The haploid gametes (daughter cells produced after meiosis) were discovered in 2014. The haploid trypomastigote-like gametes can interact with each other via their flagella and undergo cell fusion (the process is called syngamy). Thus, in addition to binary fission, T. brucei can multiply by sexual reproduction. Trypanosomes belong to the supergroup Excavata and are one of the earliest diverging lineages among eukaryotes. The discovery of sexual reproduction in T. brucei supports the hypothesis that meiosis and sexual reproduction are ancestral and ubiquitous features of eukaryotes. Infection and pathogenicity The insect vectors for T. brucei are different species of tsetse fly (genus Glossina). The major vectors of T. b. gambiense, causing West African sleeping sickness, are G. palpapalis, G. tachinoides, and G. fuscipes. While the principal vectors of T. b. rhodesiense, causing East African sleeping sickness, are G. morsitans, G. pallidipes, and G. Swynnertoni. Animal trypanosomiasis is transmitted by a dozen species of Glossina. In later stages of a T. brucei infection of a mammalian host the parasite may migrate from the bloodstream to also infect the lymph and cerebrospinal fluids. It is under this tissue invasion that the parasites produce the sleeping sickness. In addition to the major form of transmission via the tsetse fly T. brucei, may be transferred between mammals via bodily fluid exchange, such as by blood transfusion or sexual contact, although this is thought to be rare. Distribution T. brucei is found where the tsetse fly vectors are prevalent. It is present in tropical and subtropical areas of Africa north of the equator, covering East, Central and West Africa. Hence, the equatorial region of Africa is called the \\"sleeping sickness\\" belt. However, the specific type of the trypanosome differs according to geography. T. b. rhodesiense is found primarily in East Africa (Botswana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe), while T. b. gambiense is found in Central and West Africa. Evolution Trypanosoma brucei gambiense evolved from a single progenitor ~10,000 years ago. It is evolving asexually and its genome shows the Meselson effect. Genetics There are two subpopulations of T. b. gambiense that possesses two distinct groups that differ in genotype and phenotype. Group 2 is more akin to T. b. brucei than group 1 T. b. gambiense. All T. b. gambiense are resistant to killing by a serum component ‚Äî trypanosome lytic factor (TLF) of which there are two types: TLF-1 and TLF-2. Group 1 T. b. gambiense parasites avoid uptake of the TLF particles while those of group 2 are able to either neutralize or compensate for the effects of TLF. In contrast T. b. rhodesiense is dependent upon the expression of a serum resistance associated (SRA) gene. This gene is not found in T. b. gambiense. =Genome= The genome of T. brucei is made up of: *11 pairs of large chromosomes of 1 to 6 megabase pairs. *3‚Äì5 intermediate chromosomes of 200 to 500 kilobase pairs. *Around 100 minichromosomes of around 50 to 100 kilobase pairs. These may be present in multiple copies per haploid genome. Most genes are held on the large chromosomes, with the minichromosomes carrying only VSG genes. The genome has been sequenced and is available on GeneDB. The mitochondrial genome is found condensed into the kinetoplast, an unusual feature unique to the kinetoplastid protozoans. The kinetoplast and the basal body of the flagellum are strongly associated via a cytoskeletal structure. In 1993, a new base, beta-d- glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil (base J), was identified in the nuclear DNA of T. brucei.  VSG coat  The surface of the trypanosome is covered by a dense coat of ~5 x 106 molecules of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). This coat enables an infecting T. brucei population to persistently evade the host's immune system, allowing chronic infection. VSG is highly immunogenic, and an immune response raised against a specific VSG coat rapidly kills trypanosomes expressing this variant. Antibody-mediated trypanosome killing can also be observed in vitro by a complement-mediated lysis assay. However, with each cell division there is a possibility that one or both of the progeny will switch expression to change the VSG that is being expressed. The frequency of VSG switching has been measured to be approximately 0.1% per division. As T. brucei populations can peak at a size of 1011 within a host this rapid rate of switching ensures that the parasite population is typically highly diverse. Because host immunity against a specific VSG does not develop immediately, some parasites will have switched to an antigenically-distinct VSG variant, and can go on to multiply and continue the infection. The clinical effect of this cycle is successive 'waves' of parasitemia (trypanosomes in the blood). Expression of VSG genes occurs through a number of mechanisms yet to be fully understood. The expressed VSG can be switched either by activating a different expression site (and thus changing to express the VSG in that site), or by changing the VSG gene in the active site to a different variant. The genome contains many hundreds if not thousands of VSG genes, both on minichromosomes and in repeated sections ('arrays') in the interior of the chromosomes. These are transcriptionally silent, typically with omitted sections or premature stop codons, but are important in the evolution of new VSG genes. It is estimated up to 10% of the T. brucei genome may be made up of VSG genes or pseudogenes. It is thought that any of these genes can be moved into the active site by recombination for expression. VSG silencing is largely due to the effects of histone variants H3.V and H4.V. These histones cause changes in the tree-dimensional structure of the T. Brucei genome that results in a lack of expression. VSG genes are typically located in the subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes, which makes it easier for them to be silenced when they are not being used. Killing by human serum and resistance to human serum killing Trypanosoma brucei brucei (as well as related species T. equiperdum and T. evansi) is not human infective because it is susceptible to innate immune system 'trypanolytic' factors present in the serum of some primates, including humans. These trypanolytic factors have been identified as two serum complexes designated trypanolytic factors (TLF-1 and ‚àí2) both of which contain haptoglobin related protein (HPR) and apolipoprotein LI (ApoL1). TLF-1 is a member of the high density lipoprotein family of particles while TLF-2 is a related high molecular weight serum protein binding complex. The protein components of TLF-1 are haptoglobin related protein (HPR), apolipoprotein L-1 (apoL-1) and apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA-1). These three proteins are colocalized within spherical particles containing phospholipids and cholesterol. The protein components of TLF-2 include IgM and apolipoprotein A-I. Trypanolytic factors are found only in a few species, including humans, gorillas, mandrills, baboons and sooty mangabeys. This appears to be because haptoglobin-related protein and apolipoprotein L-1 are unique to primates. This suggests these genes originated in the primate genome -. Human infective subspecies T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense have evolved mechanisms of resisting the trypanolytic factors, described below. =ApoL1= ApoL1 is a member of a six gene family, ApoL1-6, that have arisen by tandem duplication. These proteins are normally involved in host apoptosis or autophagic death and possess a Bcl-2 homology domain 3. ApoL1 has been identified as the toxic component involved in trypanolysis. ApoLs have been subject to recent selective evolution possibly related to resistance to pathogens The gene encoding ApoL1 is found on the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q12.3). Variants of this gene, termed G1 and G2, provide protection against T. b. rhodesiense. These benefits are not without their downside as a specific ApoL1 glomeropathy has been identified. This glomeropathy may help to explain the greater prevalence of hypertension in African populations. The gene encodes a protein of 383 residues, including a typical signal peptide of 12 amino acids. The plasma protein is a single chain polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 42 kiloDaltons. ApoL1 has a membrane pore forming domain functionally similar to that of bacterial colicins. This domain is flanked by the membrane addressing domain and both these domains are required for parasite killing. Within the kidney, ApoL1 is found in the podocytes in the glomeruli, the proximal tubular epithelium and the arteriolar endothelium. It has a high affinity for phosphatidic acid and cardiolipin and can be induced by interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha. =Hpr= Hpr is 91% identical to haptoglobin (Hp), an abundant acute phase serum protein, which possesses a high affinity for hemoglobin (Hb). When Hb is released from erythrocytes undergoing intravascular hemolysis Hp forms a complex with the Hb and these are removed from the circulation by the CD163 scavenger receptor. In contrast to Hp‚ÄìHb, the Hpr‚ÄìHb complex does not bind CD163 and the Hpr serum concentration appears to be unaffected by hemolysis. =Killing mechanism= The association HPR with hemoglobin allows TLF-1 binding and uptake via the trypanosome haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor (TbHpHbR). TLF-2 enters trypanosomes independently of TbHpHbR. TLF-1 uptake is enhanced in the low levels of haptoglobin which competes with haptoglobin related protein to bind free hemoglobin in the serum. However the complete absence of haptoglobin is associated with a decreased killing rate by serum. The trypanosome haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor is an elongated three a-helical bundle with a small membrane distal head. This protein extends above the variant surface glycoprotein layer that surrounds the parasite. The first step in the killing mechanism is the binding of TLF to high affinity receptors‚Äîthe haptoglobin- hemoglobin receptors‚Äîthat are located in the flagellar pocket of the parasite. The bound TLF is endocytosed via coated vesicles and then trafficked to the parasite lysosomes. ApoL1 is the main lethal factor in the TLFs and kills trypanosomes after insertion into endosomal / lysosomal membranes. After ingestion by the parasite, the TLF-1 particle is trafficked to the lysosome wherein Apo1 is activated by a pH mediated conformational change. After fusion with the lysosome the pH drops from ~7 to ~5. This induces a conformational change in the ApoL1 membrane addressing domain which in turn causes a salt bridge linked hinge to open. This releases ApoL1 from the HDL particle to insert in the lysosomal membrane. The ApoL1 protein then creates anionic pores in the membrane which leads to depolarization of the membrane, a continuous influx of chloride and subsequent osmotic swelling of the lysosome. This influx in its turn leads to rupture of the lysosome and the subsequent death of the parasite. =Resistance mechanisms: T. b. gambiense= Trypanosoma brucei gambiense causes 97% of human cases of sleeping sickness. Resistance to ApoL1 is principally mediated by the hydrophobic √ü-sheet of the T. b. gambiense specific glycoprotein. Other factors involved in resistance appear to be a change in the cysteine protease activity and TbHpHbR inactivation due to a leucine to serine substitution (L210S) at codon 210. This is due to a thymidine to cytosine mutation at the second codon position. These mutations may have evolved due to the coexistence of malaria where this parasite is found. Haptoglobin levels are low in malaria because of the hemolysis that occurs with the release of the merozoites into the blood. The rupture of the erythrocytes results in the release of free haem into the blood where it is bound by haptoglobin. The haem is then removed along with the bound haptoglobin from the blood by the reticuloendothelial system. =Resistance mechanisms: T. b. rhodesiense= Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense relies on a different mechanism of resistance: the serum resistance associated protein (SRA). The SRA gene is a truncated version of the major and variable surface antigen of the parasite, the variant surface glycoprotein. It has a low sequence homology with the VSGc (<25%). SRA is an expression site associated gene in T. b. rhodesiense and is located upstream of the VSGs in the active telomeric expression site. The protein is largely localized to small cytoplasmic vesicles between the flagellar pocket and the nucleus. In T. b. rhodesiense the TLF is directed to SRA containing endosomes while some dispute remain on its presence in the lysosome. SRA binds to ApoL1 using a coiled‚Äìcoiled interaction at the ApoL1 SRA interacting domain while within the trypanosome lysosome. This interaction prevents the release of the ApoL1 protein and the subsequent lysis of the lysosome and death of the parasite. Baboons are known to be resistant to Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. The baboon version of the ApoL1 gene differs from the human gene in a number of respects including two critical lysines near the C terminus that are necessary and sufficient to prevent baboon ApoL1 binding to SRA. Experimental mutations allowing ApoL1 to be protected from neutralization by SRA have been shown capable of conferring trypanolytic activity on T. b. rhodesiense. These mutations resemble those found in baboons, but also resemble natural mutations conferring protection of humans against T. b. rhodesiense which are linked to kidney disease.

Uses Wet wipes can serve a number of personal and household purposes.Rockline, [https://www.rockline.co.uk/products/ Product line Although marketed primarily for wiping infants' bottoms in diaper changing, it is not uncommon for consumers to also use the product to clean floors, toilet seats, and other surfaces around the home. Parents also use wet wipes, or as they are called for baby care, baby wipes, for wiping up baby vomit and to clean babies' hands and faces. =Baby wipes= Baby wipes are wet wipes used to cleanse the sensitive skin of infants. These are saturated with solutions anywhere from gentle cleansing ingredients to alcohol-based \\"cleaners\\". Baby wipes are typically different pack counts (ranging up to 80 or more sheets per pack), and come with dispensing mechanisms. The origin of baby wipes most likely came in the mid-1950s as more people were travelling and needed a way to clean up on the go. One of the first companies to produce these was a company called Nice-Pak. They made napkin sized paper cloth saturated with a scented skin cleanser. Rockline Industries of Sheboygan, Wisconsin (which has a large part of the private label wipe market in several segments) went on to be the first to innovate the first baby wipe refill pack and pop-up packs which have become common in the marketplace. The first wet-wipe products specifically marketed as baby wipes, such as Kimberly-Clark's Huggies wipes and Procter & Gamble's Pampers wipes, appeared on the market in 1990. As the technology to produce wipes matured and became more affordable, smaller brands began to appear. By the 1990s, most super stores like Kmart and Wal-Mart had their own private label brand of wipes made by other manufacturers. After this period there was a boom in the industry and many local brands started manufacturing because of low entry barriers. In June 2020, UK based company MyPura.com Limited launched a line of 100% plastic-free, 100% biodegradable baby wipes, designed to help busy parents to be more eco-friendly. Some green-minded parents, or those looking to save extra money, use washable baby wipes, typically small squares of material (such as cotton, bamboo or fleece) that can be pre-soaked ready to use, or wet as required. The cloths are wetted with either just water, commercial wipe solution or homemade solutions. Some parents prefer to use only water or their own homemade solutions as they can more directly control the ingredients used on the child‚Äôs skin. Some parents feel that cloth wipes are more effective at removing solids from the skin than commercial one-use wipes because of their textured nature. In December 2018, a New Zealand company launched the country‚Äôs first ever wet and baby wipe alternative, the BD√âT Foam Wash, which turns ordinary toilet paper into a cleansing, hygienic wipe. The 100% flushable wipe, is made from 98.9% natural ingredients and was approved safe to flush by the country‚Äôs largest wastewater and sewerage network provider, Watercare. The product will be available to buy in supermarkets across the country. Their hope is to eliminate the amount of plastic wipes causing damage to the environment each year globally. =Personal hygiene= Wet wipes are often included as part of a standard sealed cutlery package offered in restaurants or along with airline meals. Wet wipes began to be marketed as a luxury alternative to toilet paper by 2005 by companies such as Kimberly-Clark and Procter & Gamble. They are dispensed in the toilets of restaurants, service stations, doctors' offices, and other places with public use. Wet wipes have also found a use among visitors to outdoor music festivals, particularly those who camp, as an alternative to communal showers. The wet wipes are a preferable option to the communal facilities, for which there are long queues. In Southeast Asia, wet wipes are often sold out of refrigerators to give the wipes a refreshingly cool effect. =Cleansing pads= Cleansing pads are fiber sponges which have been previously soaked with water, alcohol and other active ingredients for a specific intended use. They are ready to use hygiene products and they are simple and convenient solutions to dispose of dirt or other undesirable elements. There are different type of cleansing pads offered by the beauty industry: make-up removing pads, anti-spot treatments and anti-acne pads that usually contain salicylic acid, vitamins, menthol and other treatments). Cleansing pads for preventing infection are usually saturated with alcohol and bundled in sterile packages. Hands and instruments may be disinfected with these pads while treating wounds. Disinfecting cleansing pads are often included in first aid kits for this purpose. Since the outbreak of H1N1 sales of individual impregnated wet wipes and gels in sachets and flowpacks have dramatically increased in the UK following the Government's advice to keep hands and surfaces clean to prevent the spread of germs. =Industrial wipes= Pre-impregnated industrial-strength cleaning wipes with powerful cleaning fluid that cuts through the dirt as the high performance fabric absorbs the residue. Industrial wipes has the ability to clean a vast range of though substances from hands, tools and surfaces, including: grime, grease, oil- and water-based paints and coatings, adhesives, silicone and acrylic sealants, poly foam, epoxy, oil, tar and more. =Pain relief= There are pain relief pads sopping with alcohol and benzocaine. These pads are good for treating minor scrapes, burns, and insect bites. They disinfect the injury and also ease pain and itching. =Pet care= Today one can find wet wipes for pet care, for example eye, ear, or dental cleansing pads (with boric acid, potassium chloride, zinc sulfate, sodium borate) for dogs, cats, horses, and birds. =Healthcare= Medical wet wipes are available for various applications. These include alcohol wet wipes, chlorhexidine wipes (for disinfection of surfaces and noninvasive medical devices) and sporicidal wipes. Medical wipes can be used to prevent the spread of pathogens such as norovirus and Clostridium difficile. Effect on sewage systems Water management companies ask people not to flush wet wipes down toilets, as their failure to break apart or dissolve in water can cause sewer blockages known as fatbergs. Since the mid-2000s, wet wipes such as baby wipes have become more common for use as an alternative to toilet paper in affluent countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. This usage has in some cases been encouraged by manufacturers, who have labelled some wet wipe brands as \\"flushable\\". Wet wipes, when flushed down the toilet, have been reported to clog internal plumbing, septic systems and public sewer systems.Shaver, Katherine (7 September 2013). 'Flushable' personal wipes clogging sewer systems, utilities say, The Washington PostStradling, Richard (31 May 2009). Flushable' wipes blamed for clogging sewage lines\\", Seattle TimesRegan, Alex (4 March 2015). \\"Wet wipes caused sewage flood in garden\\", Oxford Mail The tendency for fat and wet wipes to cling together allegedly encourages the growth of the problematic obstructions in sewers known as \\"fatbergs\\". In addition, some brands of wipes contain alcohol, which can kill the bacteria and enzymes responsible for breaking down solid waste in septic tanks.Conte, Chris (12 Sept 2013). \\"Flushable Wipes Creating Messy Septic Issues\\", Newschannel5.com In the late 2010s, other alternatives such as gel wipe had also come on to the market.Saat, Siim (25 June 2016). \\"New Product Development: GEL WIPE by SATU\\". LinkedIn. In 2014 a class action suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio against Target Corporation, and Nice-Pak Products Inc. on behalf of consumers in Ohio who purchased Target-brand flushable wipes. The lawsuit alleged the retailer misled consumers by marking the packaging on its Up & Up brand wipes as flushable and safe for sewer and septic systems. The lawsuit also alleged that the products were a public health hazard because they clogged pumps at municipal waste-treatment facilities. Target and Nice-Pak agreed to settle the case in 2018. In 2015, the city of Wyoming, Minnesota, launched a class action suit against six companies, including Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark, and Nice-Pak, alleging they were fraudulently promoting their products as \\"flushable\\". The city dropped the lawsuit in 2018 after concluding that the city had not experienced damage to its sewer systems or a rise in maintenance costs. Upon announcement of the withdrawal of the suit, an industry trade group representing the manufacturers of the wipes released a statement that disputed the claims that the products are harmful to sewer systems. In 2019, the industry body Water UK announced a new standard for flushable wet wipes. Wipes will need to pass rigorous testing in order to gain a new and approved \\"Fine to Flush\\" logo. As of January 2019, only one product had been confirmed to meet the standard, although there were about seven others in the process of being tested.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46835573 In June 2020, UK based company MyPura.com Limited launched a Water UK \\"Fine to Flush\\" tested and approved flushable baby wipe https://www.lbbonline.com/news/eco-friendly- pura-wipes-shake-up-the-baby-care-routine for UK consumer sale. .

Biography He was born in Marietta, Pennsylvania and raised in Roxbury, Massachusetts. Serving in the Army for Korean War duty, Dawson played with the Army Dance Band while stationed at Fort Dix from 1951‚Äì1953. During his tenure, Alan explored the post-bop era by performing with pianist Sabby Lewis. After being released from the Army, Alan toured Europe with Lionel Hampton. Dawson is best remembered as an early teacher of Tony Williams, and Sawyer Brown drummer, Joseph Smyth. Other former students include: Terri Lyne Carrington, Julian Vaughn, Vinnie Colaiuta, Steve Smith, Kenwood Dennard, Gerry Hemingway, Jeff Sipe, Billy Kilson, and many others. He began teaching at Berklee College of Music in 1957. Dawson suffered a ruptured disc in 1975 which led to him halting his touring schedule, to leave Berklee and limit his teaching to his home in Lexington, Massachusetts. His teaching style emphasized the music as a whole rather than concentrate on percussion alone. He stressed the importance of learning the melody and structure of the tune to better fulfill the role of accompaniment. For this purpose, he had students play over standards while also singing the melody out loud. He constantly strived for balance between musical ideas and strict technique. He was big on rudiments and wrote extensive exercises intended to be practiced with brushes. He believed using brushes with his \\"Rudimental Ritual\\" would reduce stick rebound allowing the sense of \\"picking up\\" the sticks. While teaching, Alan also maintained a prolific performing and recording career. Dawson was the house drummer for Lennie's on the Turnpike in Peabody, Massachusetts from 1963 through to 1970. This gig allowed him to perform with a diverse group of jazz artists. Around this time, Dawson was Boston's premier jazz drummer for local acts as well as bigger name touring artists. Throughout the 1960s Dawson recorded almost exclusively with saxophonist Booker Ervin on Prestige Records. In 1968 Dawson replaced Joe Morello in the Dave Brubeck Quartet and continued until 1972. His performance credits also included stints with Bill Evans, Sonny Rollins, Jaki Byard, Booker Ervin, Sonny Stitt, Dexter Gordon, Lee Konitz, Quincy Jones, Charles Mingus, Tal Farlow and many other top jazz artists. Dawson's teaching methods have been passed on by many of his former students. Books on his approach have been written by John Ramsay and Osami Mizuno, both former students. Alan Dawson died of leukemia on February 23, 1996.

Clarke (also known as De Clarke and DeAnander) is an American radical feminist essayist and activist, notable for her development of feminist theory, and for the anonymous poem privilege.  Career  Much of Clarke's writing addresses the link between violence against women and market economics, although she may be best known for her 1991 essay \\"Justice Is A Woman With A Sword\\". In that essay, which she has updated twice for editions of the anthology Transforming a Rape Culture, she argues that feminist theory has taken a dogmatic approach to nonviolence and that women's self-defense, violent feminist activism, and the encouragement of positive media portrayals of violent women (such as in Kill Bill or Xena: Warrior Princess) have not been given the serious consideration they should receive and that their dismissal from mainstream feminism, while it may ultimately be desirable, has not been based on a properly thorough analysis. Her most popular work, however, may be the one least often correctly attributed to her: the early poem privilege, which has been found on dorm refrigerators and bulletin boards ascribed to 'Anonymous.' In this case, at least, Anonymous really was a woman. In addition to being published in print anthologies, much of her work has appeared online.

A latch typically engages another piece of hardware on the other mounting surface. Depending upon the type and design of the latch, this engaged bit of hardware may be known as a keeper or strike. A latch is not the same as the locking mechanism of a door or window, although often they are found together in the same product. Latches range in complexity from flexible one-piece flat springs of metal or plastic, such as are used to keep blow molded plastic power tool cases closed, to multi-point cammed latches used to keep large doors closed. Common types =Deadbolt latch= A single-throw bolt. The bolt can be engaged in its strike plate only after the door is closed. The locking mechanism typically prevents the bolt from being retracted by force. =Spring latches= Knob has crescent-shaped bar which pulls back latch bolt when turned. Version on upper right has a lock; version on upper left does not. Kwikset uses this shape. Other companies have square or D-shaped bars. * Latch bolt An extremely common latch type, typically part of a lockset, it is a spring-loaded bolt with an angled edge.Note 'Latch bolt' label on Lockset diagram Latch bolt definition at Answers.com When the door is pushed closed, the angled edge of the latch bolt engages with the lip of the strike plate; a spring allows the bolt to retract. Once the door is fully closed, the bolt automatically extends into the strike plate, holding the door closed. The latch bolt is disengaged (retracted) typically when the user turns the door handle, which via the lockset's mechanism, manually retracts the latch bolt, allowing the door to open. * Deadlocking latch bolt (deadlatch) is an elaboration on the latch bolt which includes a guardbolt to prevent ‚Äúshimming‚Äù or ‚Äújimmying‚Äù of the latch bolt. When the door is closed, the latch bolt and guardbolt are retracted together, and the door closes normally, with the latch bolt entering the strike plate. The strike plate, however, holds the guardbolt in its depressed position: a mechanism within the lockset holds the latch bolt in the projected position. This arrangement prevents the latch bolt from being depressed through the use of a credit card or some other tool, which would lead to unauthorized entry. * Draw Latch is a two part latch where one side has an arm that can clasp to the other half, and as it closes the clasp pulls the two parts together. Frequently used on tool boxes, chests, crates and windows. Doesn't need to be fully closed to secure both halves. * Spring bolt lock (or night latch): A locking mechanism used with a latch bolt = Slam latch = A slam latch uses a spring and is activated by the shutting or slamming of a door. Like all latches, a slam latch is a mechanism to hold a door closed. The slam latch derives its name from its ability to slam doors and drawers shut without damaging the latch. A slam latch is rugged and ideal for industrial, agricultural and construction applications. = Cam lock = The base portion of a cam lock Offset cam A cam lock is a type of latch consisting of a base and a cam. The base is where the key or tool is used to rotate the cam, which is what does the latching. Cams can be straight or offset; offset cams are reversible. Commonly found on garage cabinets, file cabinets, tool chests, and other locations where privacy and security is needed. = Norfolk latch = A Norfolk latch is a type of latch incorporating a simple thumb-actuated lever and commonly used to hold wooden gates and doors closed. In a Norfolk latch, the handle is fitted to a backplate independently of the thumb piece. Introduced around 1800‚Äì1820, Norfolk latches, originating in the English county of the same name, differ from the older Suffolk latch, which lacked a back plate to which the thumbpiece is attached. = Suffolk latch = A Suffolk latch is a type of latch incorporating a simple thumb- actuated lever and commonly used to hold wooden gates and doors closed. The Suffolk latch originated in the English county of Suffolk in the 16th century and stayed in common use until the 19th century. They have recently come back into favour, particularly on garden gates and sheds. They were common from the 17th century to around 1825, and their lack of a back plate made them different from the later, and neighbouring Norfolk latch (introduced 1800‚Äì1820). Both the Suffolk latch and Norfolk latch are thought to have been named by architectural draughtsman William Twopenny (1797-1873).Article on Suffolk Latches Many of these plates found their way into America and other parts of the world. =Crossbar= A crossbar on a door A crossbar, sometimes called a bolt, is a primitive fastener consisting simply of a post barring a door. Crossbars were historically common, simple fasteners consisting simply of a plank or beam mounted to one side of a door by a set of cleats. The board could be slid past the frame to block the door. Alternatively, the bar can be a separate piece that is placed into open cleats or hooks, extending across the frame on both sides. The effect of this device is essentially the opposite of the crash bar in that its operation is to permit the door to be opened inward rather than outward. On a set of double doors, the same principle works, but needn't extend past the frame. The bar simply extends into another set of cleats on the other door such as to interfere with the door opening. =Cabin hook= A cabin hook latch A cabin hook is a hooked bar that engages into a staple.interiordezine.com The bar is usually attached permanently to a ring or staple that is fixed with screws or nails to woodwork or a wall at the same level as the eye screw. The eye screw is usually screwed into the adjacent wall or onto the door itself. Used to hold a cupboard, door or gate open or shut. A cabin hook is used in many situations to hold a door open, like on ships to prevent doors from swinging and banging against other woodwork as the ship moves due to wave action. This usage spread also to other domains, where a door was required to be held open or a self-closing device is used to close the door. Many buildings are built with fire-resistant doors to separate different parts of buildings and to allow people to be protected from fire and smoke. When using a cabin hook in such a situation, one should keep in mind that a fire-resistant door is an expensive and heavy item, and it only works as a fire door if it is always closed. To hold an often heavy fire door open simply, (magnetic) door holders are used that release when a building's fire alarm system is activated. As cabin hooks must be activated manually, they are impractical for fire doors. =Toggle latch= Also named draw latch or draw catch. It has a claw or a loop that catches the strike plate (named catch plate in this case) when reaching a certain position.catch-plate , wordnik.comWhat is the proper term for a latch that uses a loop and lever to draw things together? , diy.stackexchange.com =Pawl= A pawl is a latch that will allow movement in one direction, but prevents return motion. Commonly used in combination with a ratchet wheel. Applications =Architecture= A latch of some type is typically fitted to a door or window. =Weaponry= Many types of weaponry incorporate latches with designs unique to the weapon.  Firearms  Firearms require specialized latches used during loading and firing of the weapon. A break-action firearm is one whose barrels are hinged and a latch is operated to release the two parts of the weapon to expose the breech and allow loading and unloading of ammunition. It is then closed and re-latched prior to firing. A separate operation may be required for the cocking and latching-open of a hammer to fire the new round. Break open actions are universal in double-barrelled shotguns, double- barrelled rifles and combination guns, and are also common in single shot rifles, pistols, and shotguns, and can also be found in flare guns, grenade launchers, air guns and some older revolver designs. Several latch designs have been used for loading revolvers. In a top-break revolver, the frame is hinged at the bottom front of the cylinder. The frame is in two parts, held together by a latch on the top rear of the cylinder. For a swing out cylinder, the cylinder is mounted on a pivot that is coaxial with the chambers, and the cylinder swings out and down. Some designs, such as the Ruger Super Redhawk or the Taurus Raging Bull, use a latches at the front and rear of the cylinder to provide a secure bond between cylinder and frame. To fire a revolver, generally the hammer is first manually cocked and latched into place. The trigger, when pulled, releases the hammer, which fires the round in the chamber.  Knives  Various types of knives with folding or retractable blades rely on latches for their function. A switchblade uses an internal spring to produce the blade which is held in place by a button-activated latch. Likewise a ballistic knife uses a strong latch to restrain a powerful spring from firing the blade as a projectile until triggered by opening the latch. A gravity knife relies on a latch to hold the folding blade in an open position once released. A balisong uses a single latch to hold the folding blade both open and closed, depending on the position of the handles; by rotating 180 degrees the same latch can be used in either configuration. Balisong latches have numerous variations, including magnetic variants and some which can be opened via a spring when the handles are squeezed together. Utility knives also often use a latch to hold a folding knife both open and closed. This allows it to be locked in orientation to the handle when in use, but also safely stowed otherwise. To open a knife of this type may require significantly more force than the weapons variety as an added safety feature.For example, this bicycle multi-tool contains a knife with a safety latch: (viewed 1 January 2009)  Other  Crossbows incorporate a type of latch to hold the drawn bowstring prior to firing. =Automobiles= Automobiles incorporate numerous special-purpose latches as components of the doors, hood/bonnet, trunk/boot door, seat belts, etc. On passenger cars, a hood may be held down by a concealed latch. On race cars or cars with aftermarket hoods (that do not use the factory latch system) the hood may be held down by hood pins. The term Nader bolt is a nickname for the bolt on vehicles that allows a hinged door to remain safely latched and closed. It is named after consumer rights advocate and politician Ralph Nader, who in 1965 released the book Unsafe at Any Speed which claimed that American cars were fundamentally flawed with respect to operator safety. Latches in seatbelts typically fasten the belt which constrains the occupant to the body of the car. Particularly in rear seats slightly different latches may be used for each seat in order to prevent adjacent seatbelts from being attached to the wrong point. Inertial seatbelt release is a potential circumstance where, in a collision, the seatbelt latch can unintentionally come loose leading to potential injury of the passenger. An additional risk of seatbelt latches is that in some cases the occupant may believe the latch is secure (e.g., by hearing a characteristic click) when in fact it is not. A parking pawl is a device that latches the transmission on automatic vehicles when put in park. =Bakeware= Close-up of springform pan A spring latch (in this case an over-center-latch) is used to hold the walls of a springform pan in place.

It has been held every two years, over a period of three or four days. From 1999 until 2009 it ran in July. In 2011, 2013 and 2016 it ran in October. In 2018, the AFOI is held on 12-15 July.Adelaide Festival of Ideas to return in July 2018Adelaide Festival of Ideas, retrieved 21 May 2018. Description The Adelaide Festival of Ideas offers contemporary civil society the highest possible level of intellectual debate across conventional boundaries and demarcations of disciplines, agendas and cultural norms with the aim of challenging the fragmentation of public knowledge. It is not held captive to any particular ideological, political or commercial agenda. The program is built around an extensive array of speaker presentations, interviews and panel discussions that are mostly free to the public. The high-level discussion and public debate offered by AFOI intends to be as engaging and entertaining as it is provocative and challenging. To maximise engagement, public access to activities held within the AFOI is free of charge wherever feasible, with the aim of attracting and engaging a diverse cross-section of the community as active citizens rather than paying customers. The AFOI recognises the considerable additional benefit gained from real-time, shared-space discussions of new ideas in a moderated context with a live audience. Background Founded by Greg Mackie, the AFOI first ran in 1999, and then every two years after that until 2013. From 1999-2009 the AFOI was produced under the auspices of the Adelaide Festival Corporation. The 2011 AFOI was auspiced by the South Australian Department of the Premier and Cabinet - Cultural Development Group, and the 2013 AFOI was produced under the auspices of The Adelaide Film Festival Corporation, all with significant baseline funding from Arts SA. However, after this funding ceased late in 2014, the AFOI was relaunched as a non-profit incorporated association in 2015 in order to present the AFOI in 2016 and annually thereafter. From the inaugural 1999 event, the AFOI program grew steadily from 28 sessions involving 27 speakers, to 88 sessions and 132 speakers (including session chairs) in the 2013 event. Each AFOI has an overarching theme within which the sessions are programmed. Typical themes include: \\"Hope and Fear\\" (2003), \\"Pushing the Limits\\" (2009), \\"Planning for Uncertainty\\" (2011), and \\"The real value of ...\\" (2013). Each AFOI is dedicated to a prominent South Australian who has had a significant impact on the development of ideas across a wide range of domains, be they geographical, intellectual, cultural or social. Dedicatees include Lowitja O'Donoghue (2003), Frank Fenner (2009), Barbara Hardy (2011) and Paul Davies (2013).

Clearly, there was an appetite for deep and civil discussion of ideas and issues that was slaked by media and political debates that run on the rocket fuel of polling and instant communication. Speakers were asked not to respond to the loudest current concerns but to think about what matters more abidingly in their fields, and to discuss ‚Äòthe real value of‚Ä¶‚Äô The 2013 AFOI was dedicated to Professor Paul Davies, physicist and science communicator extraordinaire. = 2011: \\"Planning for Certainty\\" = 7 - 9 October 2011http://adelaidefestivalofideas.com.au/festivals/2011-planning-for- certainty/ The 2011 AFOI was devoted to the proposition that we can plan with reasonable probability to shape the improbabilities that confront us as individuals or a community. We can have better debates ‚Äì then, therefore, build better cities, cultures, democracies, products, and environments. We can confront the future intelligently, imperfectly ‚Äì learning and adapting as we go.

In the bicentennial year of Darwin, whose idea of evolution is the single most consequential idea in the modern world, speakers engaged the audience in discussions of the power and consequences of the ethic of exploration and expansion which shaped, and perhaps risked, the modern world.

Neff 95 U.S. 714 (1878) was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court held that a state court can only exert personal jurisdiction over a party domiciled out-of-state if that party is served with process while physically present within the state. Factual and procedural background Sylvester Pennoyer Marcus Neff hired an attorney, John H. Mitchell, to help him with paperwork and other legal matters incidental to his efforts to obtain a land grant under the Donation Law of Oregon, an act of the United States Congress enacted on September 27, 1850 (expired December 1, 1855) which provided an incentive for the development of land in the territories of the American West by conveying parcels of land to be used for further development. Neff was ultimately successful in procuring property on the ancestral homeland of the Multnomah Indian tribe in Multnomah County, Oregon. The property had an estimated value of $15,000 at the time. Mitchell later sued Neff in the Circuit Court of Multnomah County for outstanding debts related to his legal services. Neff was served process via publication in a newspaper. Mitchell won the lawsuit by default judgment which was entered in Mitchell's favor after Neff failed to appear in court. When Mitchell won the lawsuit in February 1866, Neff's land grant had not yet been conferred to him. Consequently, Mitchell, possibly waiting for the arrival of the grant, did not levy execution on the property until July 1866. Mitchell arranged for the sheriff to seize the land, purchased it at public auction, and subsequently assigned it to Sylvester Pennoyer. Neff sued Pennoyer in 1874 in federal court to recover his land. After Neff won, Pennoyer appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Issue The Supreme Court was asked to determine whether a state court has personal jurisdiction over a non-resident (Neff) when such non-resident: (a) did not voluntarily appear before the court; (b) was not personally served with process while within the state; and (c) held property within the state at the time of the original lawsuit, but the property was not attached to the suit when it was initiated. (Neff's property was attached by Mitchell later in an attempt to execute the judgment, but not at the beginning.) Result The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Neff, holding that for the trial court to have jurisdiction over the property, the property needed to be attached before the start of litigation, whereupon the trial court has quasi in rem jurisdiction. Constructive notice as opposed to actual notice is insufficient under US law to inform a person living in another state, except for cases affecting the personal status of an American plaintiff (like divorce) or cases that are in rem, in which the property sought is within the boundaries of the state and the law presumes that property is always in the possession of the owner who therefore knows what happens to the property. Thus, attachment of the property before judicial proceedings makes constructive notice sufficient. Subsequent history Many aspects of the Court's ruling in this case have subsequently been overturned for cases in which personal or in personam jurisdiction is concerned. In a long series of United States Supreme Court jurisprudence following this ruling, the Court has modified the territorial analysis without overruling its holding. Indeed, it seems the basis of a state's authority to decide the \\"status\\" of its citizens, for example, as in a divorce without having personal jurisdiction over the respondent remains undisturbed. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that all determinations of state-court personal jurisdiction must be evaluated in light of and via application of the doctrine of \\"minimum contacts.\\" The \\"minimum contacts test\\" is now used almost exclusively in accordance with these decisions and has also been held to apply to jurisdictional analysis in federal court settings as well as state courts. The doctrines governing personal jurisdiction in the United States have spawned a great deal of discourse within the Supreme Court of the United States with many cases finetuning and elaborating upon the concept, which has led to the test used today, in which the overall scope of the test for determining whether a court may exert personal jurisdiction over a party has been expanded in certain respects but narrowed in others. Nevertheless, in every case, the Supreme Court has ruled that such analyses must comport with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Place in law schools In law schools, the Pennoyer case is commonly taught in civil procedure classes. While scholars disagree as to the extent that federal legal procedure remains bound to its direct legacy, Pennoyer is a seminal sample of early jurisdictional jurisprudence.Casebriefs: Pennoyer v.

In the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), there are five exams: Theology, Worship and Sacraments, Polity, Biblical Exegesis (undertaken in either Biblical Greek or Hebrew, with the same language for all students taking the exam at the same time.), and the Bible Content Exam. The first three, respectively, are taken via the Internet over the course of two days. The fourth exam is given to students at the conclusion of the other three exams, and is taken home for completion. In addition, all candidates for ministry must pass a fifth ordination exam typically given the first year of seminary called the Bible Content Exam. Exams are graded by at least two readers. Each reader assigns a grade of Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory to each essay question. Then if the student passes a majority of questions for that reader, the reader assigns a Satisfactory grade. If one reader passes a student, and a second fails that student, a third reader is then called in to make a final judgment and the use of the third reader is not visible to the student or their ordaining body. Special considerations are made for students whose first language is not English, and the exam is regularly administered in Spanish and Korean. It is common for students to have to take their exams several times before passing. Up to 28% of ordained ministers will have repeated at least one exam. Some, though not all, presbyteries impose a limit on the number of times their candidates may attempt an exam. Others allow for alternative formats. Still, a fair number of students do not pass all of their exams after several tries. It is not unheard of for a candidate to be dismissed from the ordination process after multiple attempts to pass the tests have failed. In addition, Presbyterian seminarians are required to pass an examination covering the content of the Bible. Practice exams are available here .

The disease is caused by Trypanosoma equiperdum, which belongs to an important genus of parasitic protozoa, and is the only member of the genus that is spread through sexual intercourse. The occurrence of dourine is notifiable in the European Union under legislation from the OIE. There currently is no vaccine and although clinical signs can be treated, there is no cure.  Parasite  Trypanosoma equiperdum is one of three known strains from the Trypanosoma family; along with Trypanosoma evansi and Trypanosoma brucei. Trypanosoma equiperdum has been discovered to be most closely linked to Trypanosoma evansi, so much so that even observation under microscope is not sufficient to differentiate between the two as their structure is very similar. Dourine is a unique disease in the sense that it has no known vectors or fomites existing in the natural world, other than members of the equine family, including donkeys, mules, and horses. In a laboratory setting, Trypanosoma equiperdum has been manipulated to adapt to and proliferate in other species, such as dogs, rabbits, mice and rats, but this has never been observed to occur naturally and without scientific manipulation. Although this limits spread of the disease because it is restricted to the equine population alone, the organism has developed complex mechanisms over time to better equip itself for prolonged survival in the equine species. This parasite efficiently evades the host animal's immune system through the use of variable surface glycoproteins or VSGs. These VSGs allow the organism to constantly manipulate and change the surface structure of its proteins, which means it is constantly being presented to the immune system as a new foreign organism and this prevents the body from mounting a large enough immune response to eradicate the disease. In this sense, Trypanosoma equiperdum is a very efficient organism; it may infect less species than other diseases, but it infects and survives very efficiently within its specified hosts. Treatment Because this disease is highly durable in its equine host, it has proved very difficult to develop a vaccine for it. There are four main drugs on the market that are used to treat the clinical signs of dourine: Suramin, Diminazen, Cymerlarsan, and Quinapyramin. However, none of the listed drugs are a cure and even the individual animals that are treated will experience relapses. Although this disease is not fatal in all cases and spontaneous recovery can occur, the death rate is relatively high and listed at a mortality rate of over fifty percent. This lack of a cure or vaccine is a definite problem in the equine industry, especially in developing countries where equines are highly valuable for both agriculture and transportation. Dourine is considered an endemic problem in developing countries, where over sixty percent of equines in the world are located. The protocol for this disease, as stated by OIE, currently stands at slaughter of seropositive animals. This is not an economically feasible option for many people who depend on horses for their livelihood. Therefore, it is crucial to continue research in this field and develop a viable vaccine.

Malik al-Ashtar became a Muslim during the time of Prophet Muhammad and since then remained an avid and loyal supporter of Muhammad's progeny and Hashemite clan. He rose to a position of prominence during the caliphate of Ali Ibn Abi Talib and participated in several battles, such as the Battle of Jamal and Siffin.

People went to Mu'awiyah with complaint, the gathering included Malik al-Ashtar and Kumayl ibn Ziyad as well. They were exiled them from Shaam to Homs. But eventually, Malik al-Ashtar, Kumayl ibn Ziyad, and the delegation made it back to Kufa. After coming back to Kufa and failing to remove al-Waleed, the delegation of Muslims (one of whom was Kumayl ibn Ziyad) led by Malik al-Ashtar set off on a journey to Madina, the capital of the Muslim empire, to address the issue with Uthman.Sayyid, KamƒÅl, and Jasim Alyawy. Malik al-Ashtar. [Qum, Iran]: Ansariyan Foundation, 1996. Print. Kumayl ibn Ziyad, Malik al-Ashtar, Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhaifa, and Abdur Rahman ibn Udays were the ones who spoke out most about al-Waleed and the corruption that was occurring. = The event of al-Rabathan = On their way to Madina, Malik al-Ashtar and the delegation stopped at al-Rabathan to visit Abu Dharr al-Ghifari. Abu Dharr, who was a companion of Muhammad and firm supporter and companion of Ali, was banished to die in the desert of Al-Rabathan. At the time, 650 a.d, Abu Dharr's health was deteriorating. Narrations state that his wife would cry, seeing her husband slowly die in the desert. However, Abu Dharr told her the prophecy of his death, which was given to him by none other than Muhammad, messenger of God. He would say, \\"One day, my friends and I was sitting with Allah's Apostle (Muhammad). And he said to us: One of you will die in the desert. And a group of believers will attend his death. All my friends passed away in their houses. And no one has remained but I. A person will come to your aid.\\" His wife then stated, \\"The time of Hajj (Pilgrimage) is over. And no one has passed through this desert.\\" Abu Dharr then told her \\"Don't worry! Go up the hill and look at the road of caravans.\\" So she went and eventually saw a caravan coming towards her. When she saw the caravan, she started to wave a piece of cloth to get the attention of the on coming caravan. When the caravan approached her she started a conversation. Malik and the delegation then sat next to Abu Dhurr. They felt sorrow to see one of the great companions of the prophet in bad condition. Malik told Abu Dhurr that they were on their way to Medina to meet with Uthman over the issue of al- Waleed. Upon hearing the news of al-Waleed, Abu Dhur became sad. After the event of al-Rabathah, Malik and the delegation continued on their long journey to Medina. When finally met Uthman, they communicated their concerns and al- Waleed's behaviors to Uthman. However they were unsuccessful in their mission thus they decided to seek Hazrat Ali's help. The downfall of Uthman and Malik's resolution Since Uthman denied to hear the concerns about al-Waleed, the delegation of concerned Muslims went to the house of Ali in Medina. They told Ali the situation with al-Waleed and Uthman. Ali was sad to hear the news. However, he assured them that he would visit Uthman personally regarding this issue. In his meeting with Uthman, Ali said \\"Uthman, the Muslims are complaining of the rulers' persecution. And you know that very well I've heard Allah's Apostle (Muhammad) saying: On the Day of Judgement, the unjust imam will be brought to hell. And no one will support or excuse him. Then, he will be thrown into hell. He'll go round and round it till he gets into its intense heat.\\" This statement made Uthman realize his mistakes. And as a result, Uthman promised to seek God's forgiveness and apologize to the Muslims. However, Marwan bin al-Hakam, the cousin of Uthman, persuaded Uthman not to do so by saying \\"You'd better threaten the people so as no one would dare to say bad words against the Caliph (Uthman).\\" Due to Marwan, Uthman broke his promise and became stricter. It is documented that he hit the noble companion Ammar ibn Yasir and whipped the companion Abdullah bin Masoud. The stricter policies caused an uproar in the Muslim empire; people began writing letter such as the following below. > Muslims, come to us. And save the Caliphate. Allah's Book has been changed. > And the Prophet's Sunnah has been changed. So, come to us if you believe in > Allah and the Day of Judgement. In a true democratic matter, Malik al-Ashtar represented the enraged Muslim in a meeting with Uthman. In the meeting, Malik asked Uthman to step down from power, but Uthman refused. Uthman's refusal to step down only led to increasing problems. Ali tried to help Uthman and resolve the issue. He sent his own two sons, Hasan ibn Ali and Hussein ibn Ali to go to Uthman and protect him from the angry protesters.Nakshawani, Ammar. \\"Biography of Malik al-Ahstar.\\" Lecture. Despite this, protesters broke into Uthman's room and killed him. After the killing of Uthman, many Muslims went to Ali and asked him to become the new caliph (leader). But he refused, but Malik and others insisted that he become the caliph. To which Malik addresses, \\"People, this is the Prophet's Regent. He has learnt the Prophet's knowledge. Allah's Book has mentioned his belief. Allah's Apostle [s] has told him that he will enter al- Ridhwan Garden. His personality is perfect The people in the past and present are certain of his behaviour and knowledge.\\" Malik was one of the first to appoint Ali as the new caliph. Battle of Jamal Mausoleum of Malik Al- Ashtar Shia visitors around his grave Name plate , Mausoleum Malik Al-Ashtar After the downfall of Uthman, many Muslims wanted to gain power within the Islamic Empire. However, Ali was appointed as the new caliph. This upset power-hungry Muslims and the enemies of Ali. As a result, they planned to launch an offensive in the year 656 AD to fight against Ali under the claim that they wanted revenge for the killing of Uthman. One of these was Marwan al Hakim, who would later become a loyal supporter of Mu'awiyah. Marwan played a key role in the Battle of Jamal, in that he formed a large army to fight against Ali. He also bankrolled the army with money that he had stolen from the Public Treasury (money which was supposed to be for Muslim citizens) during the time of Uthman. The army included Aisha, Talha, Zubair (the cousin of Ali), and Marwan. Once the army was formed, the rebels headed to Basrah, Iraq. When Ali got news that a mutiny was going to occur, he also formed an army to combat the rebel forces. During the mutiny, the new governor of Kufa, Abu Musa al-Ashary, encouraged the Kufains (citizens of Kufa) not to join Ali's army. Additionally, he encouraged the people to distance themselves and disobey the new caliph, Ali. When Ali realized the situation in Kufa, he sent Malik al-Ashter to rally up troops. As a firm and loyal supporter of Ali Ibn Abi Talib, Malik rallied up the Kufian (citizens of Kufa) with a powerful speech. In the meantime, Abu Musa al-Ashary was commanding people to stay in their homes and not fight for Ali. Malik understood that he needed to remove Abu Musa al-Ashary. So Malik and a large group of fighters seized the palace. Luckily, Abu Musa al-Ashary was at the mosque. His guards informed him that Malik al-Ashtar and a large number of fighters had taken control of the palace. Since Abu Musa al-Ashary was not capable of fighting off Malik, he surrendered. And asked Malik to give him a day to leave Kufa. Malik accepted his offer and let Abu Musa al-Ashary leave peacefully. Once Abu Musa al-Ashary left, Malik delivered another powerful speech (in the mosque) that captivated the hearts of the Kufains. The speech successfully aroused more than 18,000 soldier to join him in order to defend against the rebel attack. 9,000 of those troops were under Malik's commands and the other 9,000 were under Hasan (the eldest son of Ali) commands. They quickly headed towards Dhiqaar, Iraq to join Ali's army. On the day of the Battle of Camel, Ali Ibn Abi Talib put Malik al-Ashtar in charge of the right wing of his army, Ammar ibn Yasir in charge of the left wing of his army, and gave the flag to his son Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah. After both sides introduced themselves (Arabian custom/tradition), Ali asked his army not to attack because they might be mistaken. He also asked his army is there is a brave soul who can take the Quran and appeal to them (the rebels). A brave young man told Ali that he is willing to do it. When the young man turned towards the rebels, the rebels killed him. After this, Ali raised his hands towards the sky and prayed \\"Allah, the eyes are gazing at you! And the hands are extended! Our lord, judge between our nation and us with justice! And you're the best judge!\\" When he finished, the war began. Malik al-Ashtar and his soldiers advanced fighting bravely. During the war, Ali Ibn Abi Talib told Malik that as long as the camel of Aisha is standing the war will continue. In order, to end the war he orders Malik al-Ashtar to cut the feet of the Aisha's camel. In addition, he orders Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, the blood brother of Aisha, to catch Aisha when she falls of the camel. Both Malik and Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr carried out their assignments, thus ending the battle. Above all, Ali ordered his soldiers to escort Aisha safely back to Medina, release the prisoners of war, and cure the injured rebels. Moreover, he forgave/pardoned all the rebels for their actions. However, after the war, Malik al-Ashtar and Ammar bin Yasir went to Aisha. Many scholars state that Malik was 70 years old in the Battle of Jamal. Overall, Malik al-Ahstar was the main cavalry and commander of the army of Ali Ibn Abi Talib in the Battle of Jamal (Battle of the Camel). Battle of Siffeen = Battles over the Euphrates River = Although the minor conflict occurred in Kirkeesya, the war took place at Siffeen (on the banks of the Euphrates) when Mu'awiyah headed a large reinforcing army to join Abi al-Awar al-Salmy and his army (Mu'awiyah's first army that attacked at night). Mu'awiyah brought reinforcements because during the minor conflict many of his soldiers were killed and injured. When they got to Siffeen, Mu'awiyah ordered an offensive to his army to gain control of the Euphrates River. By taking the control of water, Mu'awiyah violated an Islamic law and the laws of war. Therefore, Ali sent Sasaah bin Suhan, one of the companions of the Prophet, to ask for some water. He states to Mu'awiyah, \\"Mu'awiyah, Ali says: Let us take some water. Then we'll decide what's between you and us, otherwise we will fight each other till the victor drinks.\\" Mu'awiyah replied \\"I'll answer you later on.\\" After Sasaah bin Suhan left, Mu'awiyah sought advice from his trusted men about what he should do about the water situation. Al-Waleed bin Uthbah (the ex-governor of Kufa, which the Quran calls a Fasiq Sura 49 Verse 6) advised Mu'awiyah to \\"Prevent them from drinking water to force them to surrender.\\" Mu'awiyah and the other men agreed. Over the course of time, Malik watched the military supply and movements taking place on the river banks. He then realized that Mu'awiyah is tightening the siege of the Euphrates River. During the course of war, the soldier in the army of Ali Ibn Abi Talib became thirsty due to the physical exertion and blistering heat. Even Malik himself became thirsty. To which a man came up to Malik and said \\"There's only little water in my water-skin, please drink it.\\" But Malik refused and told him \\"I won't drink till all soldiers drink!\\" Noticing that most of the soldiers were thirsty, Malik went to Ali and said \\"Amirul Mu'mineen, our soldiers are very thirsty. We've nothing but fighting.\\" So Ali Ibn Abi Talib wrote a letter to Muawiyah asking for water. However, Mu'awiyah denied giving Ali Ibn Abi Talib's soldiers water. Once again, Malik al-Ashtar plays a huge role for the army of Ali Ibn Abi Talib . Ali Ibn Abi Talib calls Malik and asks him to lead his soldiers in an attack to gain possession of the Euphrates River. Malik and his men fight valiantly and won back the possession of the Euphrates river. The following day, an arrow with a letter attached was shot at Ali's army. Soldiers read the letter which said \\"From a loyal brother in the Shamian Army, Mu'awiyah is going to open the river to drown you. So, be careful!\\" and passed the news around. This news caused the soldiers to withdraw from the banks of the Euphrates River. Mu'awiyah noticed this and decided to recapture the river for his army. Yet again, Ali sends his soldiers to fight of Mu'awiyah's troops and gain control of the river. At this point, Mu'awiyah became worried that now Ali won't allow them to drink water from the river. He even ask Amr ibn al-As, \\"Do you think Ali will prevent us from drinking water?\\" To which Amr replied, \\"Ali doesn't do as you do!\\" Ironically, Mu'awiyah's writes a letter to Ali Ibn Abi Talib asking him for water since his (Mu'awiyah) soldiers were now thirsty. Ali Ibn Abi Talib grants Mu'awiyah and his soldiers permission to drink water from the Euphrates River. Allowing the rebels to drink water changed the mindset of some people in Mu'awiyah's army. They reflected upon both Mu'awiyah and Ali. And realized that Mu'awiyah did everything and anything including breaking Islamic laws to win the war. Whereas, Ali did everything to represent the true Islam even if it meant losing the war. And at nighttime, some of Mu'awiyah's troops went and joined Ali's army because they represented the truth and humanity. = Malik's discipline and the end of the war = As the battle continued, Malik al-Ashtar fought his way through the opposing army until he was two rows away from Mu'awiyah's tent. Only two rows away from killing Mu'awiyah and ending the war. However, a situation occurred. Mu'awiyah wanted to trick Ali's army to stop fighting and disunite them by creating confusion.Malik Al-Ashtar. [Qum, Iran]: Ansariyan Foundation, 1996. Print. Mu'awiyah loved the idea and ordered his soldiers to place the Quran on their spear. When most of the soldiers of Ali saw this they stopped fighting. Though Ali knew that it was a trick by Mu'awiyah to create confusion and disunity, he told his army \\"It's a trick! I was the first to invite them to Allah's Book. And I was the first to believe in it. They've disobeyed Allah and broken His promise.\\" (this is referring to the negotiation/persuading process before the war) Ali wanted his soldier to continue fighting because they were so close to victory. Despite Ali's effort, 22,000 soldiers disobeyed his commands and said \\"Stop fighting and order al-Ashtar to withdraw!\\" Knowing that his own soldiers had turned their backs on him and a few group of true believers, Ali Ibn Abi Talib told his soldiers to command Malik to return for safety reasons. The messenger gave Malik the order. Even though, Malik knew that he has the opportunity to end the war and rid the world of Ma'uwiyah, he stopped and returned. Malik said \\"If Ali ibn Abi Talib orders something, I have to return\\". = The arbitration = They ceased fighting and agreed to an arbitration according to the Quran. Mu'awiyah chose Amr ibn al-As to represent him and Ali chose Abdullah bin Abbas (because he was a wise man who had a good knowledge of the Quran). But the rebel did not agree to Abdullah bin Abbas and told Ali to pick Abu Musa al-Ashary (because Abu Musa was not really a firm supporter of Ali therefore the rebels could get an upper hand in the arbitration). Ali replied to them saying \\"I disagree with you on him. And Abdullah bin Abbas is better than he (Abu Musa).\\" But the rebels again denied. Ali then chose Malik al-Ashtar to represent him. Once again, the rebels refused and insisted for Abu Musa. To avoid further chaos/conflict, Ali told them \\"Do whatever you like!\\" As a result, Amr ibn al-As and Abu Musa entered the arbitration. Knowing that Abu Musa was not a firm supporter of Ali, Amr ibn al-As deceived Abu Musa by saying \\"Abu Musa, Mu'awiyah and Ali have caused all these troubles. So, lets dispose them and elect another man.\\" Abu Musa took the bait and stated \\"I'm removing Ali from the caliphate as I'm removing my ring from my finger.\\", then he removed his ring. Afterwards, Amr ibn al-As said \\"I'm fixing Mu'awwiyah to the caliphate as I'm fixing my ring to my finger.\\", then he wore his ring. The trick worked but Ali still had control of the caliphate. Both sides did agree to a truce and a year of peace. Ali commanded his soldiers not to fight for a year, but a large group (who developed their own beliefs of \\"La Hukma Illa Lillah\\", meaning, \\"no rulership except by Allah alone.\\") broke away from Ali and disobeyed the agreement/orders. They became known as the Khawarij and fought Ali in the Battle of Nahrawan. Becoming governor of Egypt At the time, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was the governor of Egypt. Amr ibn al-As, one of Mu'awiyah's companions, wanted to become the governor of Egypt. So he rallied 6,000 soldiers and headed towards Egypt. After finding out about the possible overthrow, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr wrote to Ali Ibn Abi Talib asking for help and support. Ali Ibn Abi Talib wrote back assuring Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, son of the first caliph and then Ali's adopted son, that he is sending his best general and one of his closest companions, Malik al-Ashtar. Ali then told Malik: \\"Malik, may Allah have mercy on you, go to Egypt. I have absolute trust in you. Rely on Allah! Use gentleness in its place and intensity in its place.\\" Muhammad ibn Ab≈´-Bakr was instructed to return to  ªAlƒ´'s capital city, Kufa. Malik Al-Ashtar was appointed Governor of Egypt in 658 (38 A.H.) by Alƒ´ ibn Abƒ´-TƒÅlib, the caliph of the Muslims, after the Battle of Siffin had ended. Assassination plot When Mu'awiyah received the news that Ali appointed Malik al-Ashtar as the new governor of Egypt, he was overwhelmed with worry. Knowing that al-Ashtar was of ferocious build and strength, Muawiyah is said to have formulated a plot to assassinate him using poison imported from Rome and sent a delegate with the poison to a certain man owning vast lands in al-Qilzim City (a service station/resting spot for travelers) on the borders of Egypt, requesting that he poison al-Ashtar in exchange for lifelong tax exemption. The man is said to have agreed to the envoy's request. Death On the way to Egypt, Malik al-Ashtar decided to stop at al-Qilzim. Upon his arrival, the man (who agreed to poison Malik) invited Malik, the new governor of Egypt, for lunch at his house. Malik humbly accepted the man's invitation without knowing that he was going to kill him by Muawiyah I on a suggestion of 'Amr ibn al-'As. They went to his home to have lunch. The man placed the poisoned honey in a cup and placed it on the table. Malik took a spoonful of the poisoned honey. When Malik consumed the honey, the poison spread rapidly throughout his body. Malik realized that he was poisoned as soon as he felt pain in his stomach. After realizing that he was poisoned, Malik placed his hand on his stomach and said \\"In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. We belong to Allah, and we'll come back to Him!\\" The poison was so destructive and toxic that within moments Malik al-Ashtar died. Muawiyah is said to have rejoiced upon hearing of al-Ashtar's death. Legacy =Descendants= Malik had two sons, the first was named Ishaq (Isaac) and the other was named Ibrahim (Abraham). Ishaq was a phenomenal warrior who supported and valiantly gave his life to protect Hussain ibn Ali, the son of Ali, in the Battle of Karbala. After Habib ibn Muzahir, Ishaq killed the most enemy fighters. On the other hand, Ibrahim ibn Malik al- Ashtar, the son of Malik al-Ashtar, along with Mukhtar al-Thaqafi rose against the killers of Hussain ibn Ali. The two killed most of the killers of Hussain and his army. For example, they caught and killed Umar ibn Sa'ad, Shimr ibn Thil-Jawshan, Sanan ibn Anas, Hurmala ibn Kahil and Ubaidullah Ibn Ziyad (these were Yazid I's soldiers who fought against Hussain). Among his descendants are the Kalbasi family, who reside in Iran and some reside in Iraq. One branch of this family adds the title \\"Ashtari\\" to the end of their family name to denote this fact. In Lebanon, the Hamadani family from the southern town of Nabatieh are also direct descendants who have maintained a family tree dating back to the Nakha'i tribe origins. The Mroueh family, after tracing their lineage, are also believed to be descendants. The Malek (or Malekian) family, from Mazandaran (Iran), are also believed to be descendants.

It is one of the oldest universities in Pakistan and was certified by ISO in 2015. In 2013, the University was ranked eighth in \\"General Category\\" by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan. Founded in 1947 in Karachi, the University was relocated to Hyderabad in 1951 where it began to function as a full-fledged teaching university. The University is associated with four colleges of law and various other colleges. Sindh University is noted for its research in literature, natural sciences, philosophy, and Sindhology. The University is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities of the United Kingdom. History University of Sindh gate After Pakistan gained independence in 1947, the only functioning university in the newly founded nation was the University of Punjab, which served the developed parts of the Punjab province. The Sindh province came under the academic purview of the University of Bombay, which had become a part of India. A formal academic centre was therefore needed for Sindh and under the constitutional act 27, titled University of Sindh, a resolution was passed by the provincial Legislative Assembly which founded the new university in Karachi, the national capital at the time. The act would later be revised in 1961 and several other times in the years to come. The 1972 revision allowed for the greater autonomy and representation of faculty that the University currently enjoys. From independence in 1947 until 1955, Hyderabad was declared as the capital of Sindh and University operations were relocated from Karachi to Hyderabad in 1951, where it formally began to function as a teaching institution striving to fulfil its charter and its mission to disseminate knowledge. The first department established at the University was the Department of Education, later renamed the Faculty of Education. The departments of basic science disciplines, as well as other departments of Humanities and Social Sciences, were added in the mid-1950s. With the sudden departmentalised growth of the University's organisational structure, a better equipped campus was desired. A new campus was established in 1955 in Jamshoro, 15 km from Hyderabad, on the right bank of the Indus river. This new campus was named after Allama Imdad Ali Imam Ali Kazi, former vice-chancellor of the University, as a tribute to his legacy as an esteemed scholar. Before Jamshoro was selected for the establishment of Sindh University, it was desolate and sparse but was deemed more suitable than Hyderabad, which lacked sufficient space to satisfy the University's ambitious expansion programs. Organisation Sindh University is administered from its central campus at Jamshoro. It is a collegiate university, encompassing four legal colleges and 74 undergraduate and post-graduate colleges in the vicinity of Hyderabad and elsewhere in Sindh. Located near the Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, and Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences, Jamshoro is the largest university city in Pakistan. =Campuses= The University has two main campuses (1 and 2) and seven other campuses. # Allama I.I. Kazi Campus in Jamshoro # Elsa Kazi Campus in Hyderabad, named after Allama I.I. Kazi's wife # Sindh University Lar Campus at Badin # Sindh University Mirpurkhas Campus # Sindh University Larkana Campus # Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed Campus Dadu # Sindh University Naushahro Firoz Campus # The University of Sufism and Modern Sciences Bhit Shah Campus # Sindh University Thatta Campus =Administration= The University's central administration, headed by the vice chancellor, is located in central Jamshoro. The campus comprises seven faculties: those of arts, pharmacy, education, Islamic studies, social sciences, natural sciences, and commerce and business administration. Each faculty is overseen by a dean appointed by the vice chancellor. Each faculty is housed in its own building. Colleges affiliated with the University primarily enforce curricular requirements and host examinations for degree- awarding status. =Teaching and degrees= Academic faculties of the University offer courses which culminate in undergraduate bachelor's, bachelor's honours (an extra year added to the bachelor's course) and postgraduate master's degrees and provide research guidance for the MPhil and PhD programmes. The teaching and research under the faculties of natural sciences, social sciences, arts, education, Islamic studies, commerce and business administration are directly imparted by the University. Each faculty is headed by a dean, appointed by the vice-chancellor for three years. The University's teaching departments, institutes and centres offer programmes culminating in a four-year bachelor's (honours) degree in general and basic disciplines under arts and humanities studies, while a four-year bachelor's degree is offered under the faculty of natural sciences. The degrees have been designated accordingly indicating various disciplines, e.g., for Computer Science, BSc(CS) and Information Technology BSc(IT), etc. The master's degree programmes are usually over one year after a bachelor's (honours) degree and over two years after other bachelor degrees. The latter programmes are conducted through affiliated colleges under the jurisdiction of the University. The teaching under the faculty of law is conducted through the affiliated professional law colleges. Degree programs with evening classes were introduced in 2002 and include master's degree courses in English and information technology disciplines such as e-commerce and multimedia technology. Many teaching departments offer a one-year postgraduate diploma as well as short-term certifications. Some of the degree colleges in the private sector that are affiliated with the University offer three-year bachelor's honours and master's degree programmes. =Developments and facilities= The development programmes initiated in 1959 have gradually borne fruit. Though still under construction, about 20 teaching blocks housing 39 institutes, departments and centres have been constructed. Five student residential halls now provide accommodation for about 1800 students. Sporting facilities include the Hyder Bux Jatoi Pavilion constructed to provide indoor gaming facilities, a track ground for athletics and a sports grounds. The Fatima Jinah Gymnasium provides game and sport facilities exclusively for women. The Institute of Sindhology building, depicting the cultural heritage of Sindh, adorns the entrance to the campus from the national highway leading to Karachi. The imposing central library building, named after Allama I.I. Kazi, serves as a landmark. The residences for faculty and staff house roughly a third of the University's employees. The University intends to expand the faculty residences and provide accommodation for 200 more employees. Formerly deserted patches of hilly tract have now been converted into tree lined roads and green pasture. The location of Mehran University, sharing the site with the Sindh University and the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences college and hospital complex in the neighbourhood substantially aided in the development of this land into a university town. The university is accessible via the national highway (N5) at the Hyderabad bypass, about 150 km from Karachi and 15 to 18 km from Hyderabad. It has hosted international conferences, symposiums and seminars on science and education and on specialized scientific themes. Inter-university sports competitions and annual sports gatherings have become regular features. The museum and art galleries of the Institute of Sindhology attract many visitors from other parts of Pakistan and the world. =Research and collaboration= The university has established links with the following leading universities of the United Kingdom to promote research and encourage faculty development. # University of Durham # University of Manchester # University of Sussex # University of Essex # University of Leicester # University of Nottingham Alumni *Allah Dino Khawaja * Sassui Palijo * Shafi Muhammad Shah * Javaid Laghari * Ameen Faheem * Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry * Muzafar Bhutto * Fahmida Riaz * Syeda Hira Fatima Naqvi * Liaquat Ali Jatoi * Mubarak Ali * Ghulam Murtaza Khan Jatoi * Raja Pervaiz Ashraf * Naeem Ahmad Khan * Mir Hazar Khan Khoso * Asadullah Bhutto * Nazeer Abbasi * Kunwar Khalid Yunus * Abdul Jabbar Junejo * Krishan Bheel * Hajiani Lanjo * Rana Bhagwandas * Ayaz Latif Palijo * Krishna Kohli * Shoaib Ahmed Soomro See also * Mehran University of Engineering and Technology * Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences * Sindh Agriculture University * Imdad Ali Imam Ali Kazi Citations External links * Official website * Official facebook page * Department of Criminology University of Sindh * Institute of Advanced Research Studies in Chemical Sciences University of Sindh * SU Alumni association & SU Alumni Category:Educational institutions established in 1947 Category:Public universities and colleges in Sindh ","title":"University of Sindh"},{"id":"2198777","text":"Master of Theology (, abbreviated MTh,ThM, or MTheol) is a post-graduate degree offered by universities, divinity schools, and seminaries.

As the unassuming soundtrack of a country breaking down and a world breaking up, its very nature means that it has been ignored. :Spacemen 3, like all the great rock 'n' rollers, from Arthur Parker to Paul Gauguin, are revolutionary; this is their great manifesto, striding free from the pharmacy raid of their debut armed with the keys of the musical medicine cabinet. When we left off things would never be the same. But the other side of the locked door, well, it's like the white one in the story. :If 'Sound of Confusion' denied the wider stretches of the sense in favour of the immediately, roughly sensual, this script panned out from some suburban global village Viet vet subculture into a poppyfield undersown with righteous paranoia.

Plot synopsis  Anya finally gets back into her old vengeance demon ways by helping a girl get revenge on an entire fraternity by having a spider demon tear their hearts out. Willow, returning to college, discovers this and she, Buffy and Xander fear the worst of Anya. Buffy is determined to kill Anya; Xander, who still loves her, cannot believe Buffy could do such a thing. Meanwhile, Anya herself is feeling deep remorse about the event - even though Halfrek tries to convince her that what she did was a work of art. Buffy and Xander track Anya back to the Frat house, where the two women fight as Xander tries to stop them. Buffy stabs Anya, seemingly killing her, but Anya's demon side prevents her from dying. Willow has called forth Anya's boss D'Hoffryn, using the amulet he gave her while trying to recruit her as Anya's replacement. When he interrupts the fight between her and Buffy, Anya begs him to reverse the spell she did - even though she knows the cost of reversing such a spell is the life and soul of a vengeance demon. Anya is ready to die, even if Xander does not want her to, but D'Hoffryn instead summons Halfrek and kills her. He tells Anya he wants her to suffer rather than die. A distraught Anya leaves and Xander follows her. They talk and Anya wanders off alone, wondering what her purpose is now that she is mortal again. =Flashbacks= * c. 880, when Anya's lover Olaf comes home and she suspects him of infidelity * 880, when Anya first became a demon, after turning her lover Olaf into a troll * 1905, when Anya and Halfrek were involved in the onset of the Russian Revolution of 1905 * 2001, a few months before Anya and Xander's failed wedding, during part of \\"Once More, With Feeling\\"  Production details  = Music = In a flashback to the musical episode \\"Once More, with Feeling\\", two new songs are heard, both written by Joss Whedon. * \\"Mrs.\\" - sung by Anya (Emma Caulfield). It was arranged and produced by Douglas Romayne, with orchestrations by Wataru Hokoyama. In the song, Xander has fallen asleep and Anya muses over how good her life will be once she becomes Mrs. Xander Harris. One of the lyrics briefly references marital doubt similar to the number the two sing in the original episode, \\"I'll Never Tell\\": \\"He's my Xander and he's awfully swell, it makes financial sense as well, although he can be... I'll never tell.\\" * Mustard/Parking ticket song - sung by Marti Noxon & David Fury. A brief off-screen number sung by David Fury and Marti Noxon. In the original episode, they played respectively a man ecstatic that the dry cleaner had gotten mustard out of his shirt, and a woman complaining about a parking ticket. Here, in a flashback set the night before their numbers, the aftermath of Noxon's character spilling mustard on Fury's character is heard. = Fullscreen vs. widescreen = In the audio commentary for the episode, writer Drew Goddard mentioned whether or not the \\"Mrs.\\" scene should have been shown in widescreen for American audiences since it was a flashback to \\"Once More, with Feeling\\", the only episode of Buffy shown in widescreen in the US. Director David Solomon thought it would have been too confusing to switch between full-frame and widescreen, so it was not done.  Trivia  * All of Kali Rocha's (Halfrek) shots in her death scene were green-screened, because of time constraints. * Sarah Michelle Gellar was only available for three days of shooting on this episode because of her wedding to Freddie Prinze, Jr. * On the DVD around the 13:30 mark, a villager chasing Olaf in the flashback yells out, \\"You asshole!\\" while chasing the troll out of town. * For the benefit of the viewers and ease of scene production, Aud and D'Hoffryn speak to each other in American English. However, from a historical perspective, American English would not exist for almost another thousand years. English at that time (Old English) would be incomprehensible to modern English speakers. * In the DVD commentary for this episode, writer Drew Goddard claims that the Sjornjost scenes were written in Swedish but he intended for the lines to be dubbed badly in English. Thus, Emma Caulfield and Abraham Benrubi were told that they did not need to memorize the Swedish that carefully because it would not be heard. Both actors memorized all of the alleged Swedish words phonetically, and the show creators were so pleased with their performances that they decided to subtitle the scenes rather than dub them. * Goddard also says that he chose the name Aud for Anya's original human name because while researching Viking names he found a Viking king named Olaf who had a wife named Aud, known for her sense of humor and her ability to manage money. The description of Aud fit Anya so well that he had to use the name. * Drew Goddard considered a flashback to \\"Hush\\" rather than to \\"Once More, With Feeling\\", but decided that it would be difficult to show Anya defining herself through Xander without dialogue. * During Anya's song there are numerous pieces of trivia. Before she begins to sing the viewer can hear people singing outside about spilling mustard on their clothes, and worrying it will never come out. Also, she talks to Xander about the 'coconuts, and asks him if it was weird - in 'Once More With Feeling' at the beginning all the Scoobies are talking together and you can hear Xander and Anya mentioning the coconuts. In \\"Once More With Feeling\\" a group of ecstatic people sing happily about mustard being removed from a man's clothes just outside the Magic Box. Also, Anya says in her song that she is good at math, most probably a nod towards her love of money, yet in her first appearance after losing her powers she complains that she is stuck in Sunnydale High and \\"flunking math!\\" An allusion to her duet with Xander \\"I'll Never Tell\\" is also included, in the line \\"Although he can be ‚Äî I'll never tell.\\" * The 1905 Russian Revolution scene at the dinner table required extras, including three women at least 5'6 in height with 22-inch waists to be shrunk even further with the use of corsets to play three Russian princesses. One day before shooting the scene, the extra agency in charge still only had booked two female extras for the parts. They ended up hiring Sophie LaPorte, of Battlestar Galactica fame, who had been with the extra agency for a short time over a decade prior, whose measurements hadn't changed, and who agreed to sign on because filming was to take place only a half mile from her home. She can be seen in a yellow gown at the dinner table with other members of Russian nobility as well as in the next scene, where out of the three princesses, she volunteered to play dead at the dinner table, and thereby not to breathe for the tight corset would have revealed it. She was so close to the man on fire who bursts into the dining room that she could see the brightness from the flames with her eyes closed.  Continuity  *Anya's history with Olaf the troll (who appeared in \\"Triangle\\" and mentioned their history briefly) is fleshed out in this episode. * In Anya's flashback sequence, before she starts singing her song, Xander mutters \\"I just want a happy ending\\". In the musical episode, \\"Once More, With Feeling\\" (season 6, episode 7), Xander claims to have summoned Sweet, a demon who makes people dance until they burn. His excuse for summoning Sweet was that \\"I just wanted to make sure we were gonna work out. Get a happy ending.\\" * In Sjornjost 880, Aud happily raises rabbits, while from season 4 until the end of the series Anya demonstrates fear and hate toward rabbits. This implies that Anya's hostility toward rabbits might be a subconscious association of them with the simple, happy life she enjoyed with Olaf before his infidelity, the action which set her life as a vengeance demon into motion. * During the battle, Anya asks Buffy \\"Are there any of your friends you haven't tried to kill?\\" This is most likely a reference to \\"Normal Again,\\" in which, under the influence of a hallucination, Buffy sets a demon loose to kill Xander, Willow, Dawn, and Tara. Buffy has also battled Willow (\\"Two to Go\\"), Angel (\\"Becoming\\") and Spike (often), Oz (\\"What's My Line, Part 1\\"), Riley (\\"The Initiative\\"), and Giles (\\"A New Man\\"). * When Anya rouses herself after Buffy stabs her through the chest, she says that Buffy should know better, that a sword through the chest doesn't kill vengeance demons. She is referencing \\"Older and Far Away\\" in which Halfrek, a fellow vengeance demon, is stabbed through the chest and calls it a \\"flesh wound.\\" She also remarks, \\"I forgot how much swords to the chest hurt,\\" implying that she had been stabbed before; but she was surprised when Halfrek survived it. * By killing Halfrek instead of Anya to restore the lives of Anya's victims just to torment her, D'Hoffryn clearly reminds Anya, as well as Xander and Buffy, that despite his wit and levity at times, he is still an evil being. When Anya tells D'Hoffryn that he should have killed her instead, he says that he wouldn't worry about that and tells her to be patient, clearly foreshadowing her death at the end of the season. * D'Hoffryn comments to Willow about her vengeance against Warren in \\"Villains.\\" * When Halfrek is congratulating a remorseful Anya in the interior of her new apartment, the camera passes a round glass jar in a box of leftover \\"Magic Box\\" supplies. It closely resembles the \\"Mu-Ping\\" Jar that will temporarily house Angel's soul during the fourth season of the spinoff series Angel. * During Anya's song, she sings the name she invented in \\"Checkpoint\\", Anya Christina Emmanuella Jenkins. She later sings that it was a stupid name she made up. * D'Hoffryn tells Xander that he sees with the \\"eyeballs of love.\\" In the episode \\"Dirty Girls,\\" Caleb tells Xander that he sees everything before putting his thumb in Xander's eye. = Arc significance = * The Xander and Anya problem is reversed in Buffy and Spike, which would be fully explored in further episodes. * Willow finally discovers that Xander never told Buffy of her plans to restore Angel's soul (season 2), when Buffy quotes the message that Xander had instead invented. However, this is never again addressed in the series. * Through the flashbacks, it is established that Anya's odd behavior throughout the series is not because she is an ex-demon, but that she has been an outcast all her life. Fittingly, her original human name Aud is pronounced \\"odd.\\"  External links  * * Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 7) episodes Category:2002 American television episodes Category:Television episodes written by Drew Goddard ","title":"Selfless (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)"},{"id":"2198823","text":"Jack Vettriano, The Singing Butler, 1992 The Singing Butler is an oil-on- canvas painting made by Scottish artist Jack Vettriano in 1992.

Nordica established herself as one of the foremost dramatic sopranos of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She had a powerful yet flexible voice and the ability to perform an unusually wide range of roles in the German, French and Italian operatic repertoires. Early life and education Lillian Allen Norton was born in 1857 in a small Cape Cod style farmhouse built by her grandfather on a hill in Farmington, Maine. Nordica as Br√ºnnhilde, 1898 In her youth, Norton is said to have possessed an inherent fondness for music and the sounds of singing birds and running brooks. When she was eight her family moved to Boston, Massachusetts to continue the musical education of her sister Wilhelmina. Wilhelmina died before her 18th birthday. Family hopes were then pinned on Lillian, and her musical education began soon thereafter. She trained as a singer in Boston, graduating from the New England Conservatory in that city at the age of 18. Career She made her public debut at the conservatory as a soloist with the Handel and Haydn Society. Convinced that she could forge a successful career as a professional performer, Norton travelled to Italy and put a final bel canto polish on her vocalism through study in Milan. \\"Nordica\\", a stage name, was bestowed by an Italian maestro at the beginning of her operatic career. He convinced her that European opera- goers would not tolerate a diva with a plain sounding, Anglo-American name. The adopted name, Giglia Nordica, meant \\"Lily of the North\\", but she soon became known as \\"Madame Nordica\\" or simply as \\"Nordica\\". As Madame Nordica, she made her operatic debut at Brescia in 1879. She achieved a high rank among the international prima donnas of her era, appearing in many major musical venues in Western Europe and Russia. She sang for example at The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1887-93 and performed at the Bayreuth Festival in Germany in 1894 as Elsa in Lohengrin. In her native America she was particularly associated with the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where her frequent stage partner was the cultured Polish tenor Jean de Reszke. She sang at the Met from 1891 until 1910, with some breaks in between. Nordica's birthplace c. 1908 By all accounts Nordica possessed an extremely big, agile and pure-toned soprano voice which she was prepared to use unstintingly. (See, for instance, Michael Scott, The Record of Singing, Volume One, pp. 38‚Äì40.) An adventurous artist, she embraced an enormously varied repertoire which included, among many other works, Aida, Wagner's Ring Cycle (as Br√ºnnhilde), Tristan und Isolde, Lohengrin, La traviata, Il trovatore, La Gioconda, Faust, Les Huguenots, Mignon and Le nozze di Figaro. She established her worldwide reputation as an opera singer of the first magnitude despite facing powerful competition during her career from a number of other outstanding dramatic sopranos. Her main rivals included Lilli Lehmann, Rosa Sucher, Katharina Klafsky, Milka Ternina, Therese Malten, Johanna Gadski, F√©lia Litvinne, Olive Fremstad, Anna von Mildenburg and Emmy Destinn. Nordica advertises Coca-Cola in 1904; placard at Biedenharn Museum and Gardens in Monroe, Louisiana. She wrote a treatise called Hints to Singers. A copy is appended to her Yankee Diva biography. By 1913, Nordica's voice and health were in decline. This did not prevent her from embarking misguidedly on a strenuous tour to Australia.Western Mail, 22 August 1913. Retrieved 9 December 2013 She nearly missed the ship leaving Sydney on her return, but wired the captain asking him to wait for her. It would prove to be a fatal mistake. The Tasman hit a coral reef, where it remained for three days, and Nordica suffered hypothermia (exposure) from which she never recovered. She was taken to Thursday Island, Queensland, where she was hospitalised for some time. There she befriended a small American boy who was taken ill while on a different vessel passing through Torres Strait. After his death, Nordica installed a gravestone in the local cemetery in his memory.postscripts, Sunday, January 13, 2013, Lillian Nordica, 2: Unlucky in Love: CHRONICLES OF CROTON'S BOHEMIA; Retrieved 11 August 2013 She was well enough on Thursday Island to make a new will, which disinherited her husband. (The Australian poet and novelist Thomas Shapcott dramatised these events in his 1998 novel Theatre of Darkness.National Library of Australia, Theatre of darkness : Lillian Nordica as opera; Retrieved 11 August 2013) She was then transferred to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta, Indonesia). She lingered for months, seeming to improve, only to fail again. She died of Pneumonia, on May 10, 1914, in Batavia. Recordings Nordica made a number of acoustic discs for Columbia Records. They were recorded comparatively late in her career, however, and are of a poor technical standard. Nevertheless, they do indicate her considerable range as a singer, for she is able to perform both coloratura showpieces (such as \\"Io son Titania\\" from Mignon) and dramatic Wagnerian solos (such as \\"Mild und leise\\" from Tristan und Isolde). Her best known record is probably that of a demanding aria from the Hungarian opera Hunyadi Laszlo by Ferenc Erkel, which she cut in 1907. Nordica can be also heard briefly in some of the Mapleson Cylinders that were recorded during actual performances at the Metropolitan Opera House during the first few years of the 20th century. The sound of these cylinders is primitive but the impressive size of Nordica's voice can be better appreciated as it rings out in a theatre acoustic. A CD of her gramophone and cylinder recordings was released by Marston Records in 2003, complete with extensive liner notes dealing with Nordica's voice and career (see below). Folklore At the University of Maine at Farmington, it is said that Lillian's ghost roams the auditorium that was given to the university in her name. Personal life and legacy Nordica's successful operatic career contrasted with her disastrous personal life. Nordica wed three times.

Gower, whom she sued for divorce in 1885, but who disappeared at about the time of the suit, probably having been killed in a balloon accident.

Her third marriage was in 1909 to a wealthy New York banker, George W. Young, but like the previous two unions, it proved unhappy. Her birthplace in Farmington, Maine, is today the Nordica Memorial Homestead, a museum and historic site.

Different logical positivists construed this doctrine in several different ways, e.g. as a reductionist thesis, that the objects investigated by the special sciences reduce to the objects of a common, putatively more basic domain of science, usually thought to be physics; as the thesis that all of the theories and results of the various sciences can or ought to be expressed in a common language or \\"universal slang\\"; or as the thesis that all the special sciences share a common method. * The writings of Edward Haskell and a few associates, seeking to rework science into a single discipline employing a common artificial language.

It is also known as Blanding Boulevard for much of its length. SR 21 is one of three routes, along with Roosevelt Boulevard (US 17) and the First Coast Expressway (SR 23), that connect Jacksonville with its surroundings west of the St. Johns River. Congestion has become a problem over the years as local government works to develop infrastructure for the growing populations of Orange Park, Middleburg and Green Cove Springs with the northern connectivity sought and thought to be achieved by drastic road widening despite the decimation of Lake Shore's prewar scale. Residents of both Clay and St. Johns counties' communities rely on Duval's economy (Jacksonville) for employment. As a result, traffic is heavy during morning and evening rush hour, especially near and on I-295. Such has spurred the creation of the Collins Road / I-295 interchange. Route description SR 21 begins at SR 20, and the western terminus of County Road 20A (CR 20A), in McMeekin in Putnam County. For the first , the road is a relatively flat two-lane rural highway heading north with occasional hills, with the only other notable intersection of importance being CR 21, a connecting spur to Marion County. North of here, the road begins to bear to the northwest, but curves to slightly back along the eastern shore of Lake Melrose. After intersecting SR 26 in Melrose, SR 21 enters Clay County briefly as it starts to move northwest and enters extreme southeastern Bradford County north of the intersection with Melrose Road, intersecting with CR 214 and CR 21B. Passing between Keystone Heights Golf and Country Club, and winding around Lake Geneva, SR 21 re-enters Clay County in Keystone Heights, acquiring the name Lakeside Avenue, and then Lawrence Boulevard. It intersects SR 100 where it makes a sharp turn to the northeast. North of Loch Lommond, SR 21 serves as the southeastern border of Camp Blanding. In this location, it also runs past Mike Roess Gold Head Branch State Park, and has a short concurrency with CR 315, after turning straight north in Belmore. West of Penney Farms, SR 21 intersects SR 16 and ceases to serve as the east side of Camp Blanding, but still remains a two-lane rural highway. Only when the road enters Middleburg does SR 21 become a four-lane divided highway just south of the intersection of CR 215 (Kingsley Lake Road), and curves to the northeast again. From here it gains the name Blanding Boulevard from here to its northern terminus. It then crosses CR 218\\\\. Shortly after then it serves as the terminus of CR 220 (Everett Avenue), and begins a hidden concurrency with SR 21, and serves as the southern terminus of CR 220A (Long Bay Road) before CR 220 ends the concurrency at Doctors Inlet Road. SR 21 then encounters Branan Field Road, which becomes SR 23 to the north. An interchange between SR 21 and SR 23 is planned to be built slightly to the west of the current intersection as part of the First Coast Expressway. The road crosses CR 220A again at Old Jennings Road. Beyond that, it has two western termini with another suffixed route, known as CR 21B (Jefferson Avenue) in Ridgewood. In Lakeside, SR 21 serves as the northern terminus of CR 224 (College Drive), providing access to Saint Johns River Community College. CR 21B ends at SR 21 again along Cleveland Avenue. Near Orange Park, the road curves straight north again where SR 224 serves as the last major intersection before entering Jacksonville, although SR 21 passes through one more community known as Meadowbrook Terrace, the home of the Orange Park Mall. North of the Clay‚ÄìDuval county line, SR 21 enters Jacksonville, and then approaches the interchange with I-295, which was recently redesigned to accommodate ramps to Collins Road, a street that intersects with SR 21 north of the interchange. Within the rest of Jacksonville, the road intersects state highways such as SR 134 (103rd Street), and later serves as the eastern terminus of SR 208 (Wilson Boulevard), where SR 21 has a wide median as opposed to a center turn lane. Two blocks north of SR 208, Blanding Boulevard crosses over the Cedar River, a tributary of the Ortega River, and enters Lake Shore. Two blocks north of the bridge, the road intersects with the southern terminus of SR 111 (Cassat Avenue). SR 21 heads northeast for several blocks until its intersection with the east-west connector San Juan Avenue SR 128\\\\. Prior to SR 21's northern terminus, Blanding continues to the northeast for several more blocks north of San Juan Avenue until it straightens to the north again and crosses St. Johns Avenue. Blanding Boulevard has a full intersection with Park Street, with eastbound Park Street providing access to US 17 south. North of Park Street, Blanding becomes a limited access connecting overpass crossing over Hamilton Street, a double tracked railroad, and has an interchange with US 17 (Roosevelt Boulevard) northbound at the edge of Florida State College at Jacksonville's Kent Campus, also with access from US 17 Roosevelt Boulevard southbound to SR 21 southbound. SR 21 ends at a second intersection with Park Street and an entrance to Kent campus at the eastern end of the interchange. Major intersections Related routes =County Road 21 in Marion and Putnam counties= County Road 21 (CR 21) is a bi-county road that begins in Orange Springs in Marion County. Rather than a true extension of SR 21, the road is a connecting spur. CR 21 begins at CR 315 in Orange Springs, and immediately crosses the Marion‚ÄìPutnam county line, where it is named Baden Powell Road. The first major intersection it encounters is CR 20A in Johnson, which runs east‚Äìwest and ends at the southern terminus of SR 21 to the west. This county road is related to a state road that CR 21 later encounters north of here, specifically SR 20 in Whiteville, which is east of the southern terminus of SR 21\\\\. The road continues north and then makes a sharp left turn becoming an east‚Äìwest road before terminating at SR 21 between McMeekin and Melrose. =County Road 21B in Bradford County= County Road 21B (CR 21B) is a suffixed route of SR 21 on the Bradford County side of Keystone Heights. It begins at SR 21 and winds along the eastern shores of the Santa Fe Lakes, and then the south side of the Santa Fe Swamp before turning north and finally terminating at SR 100 near Theressa. =County Road 21A in Clay County= County Road 21A (CR 21A) is a suffixed county route of SR 21 that is officially recognized by FDOT as two different streets in Middleburg, Florida. The first of which is Forman Circle, a loop street on the west side of SR 21, the north end of which runs parallel to Peppergrass Street. The other is Black Creek Drive, which has no connection to SR 21 and begins at CR 218, running south until it reaches a dead end along the South Fork of Black Creek. =County Road 21B in Clay County= County Road 21B (CR 21B) is another county suffixed alternative route of SR 21\\\\. It begins at SR 21 as Taylor Avenue heading northwest, then turns right onto Washington Avenue a few blocks to the north and runs parallel to SR 21, running northeast through the heard of Ridgewood. Later it makes another turn to the right onto Cleveland Avenue and heads southeast until finally terminating at SR 21 near Lakeside.

The \\"New Perspective on Paul\\" represents a significant shift in the field of biblical studies since the 1970s in the understanding of the writings of the Apostle Paul, due to E. P. Sanders' pioneering 1977 work Paul and Palestinian Judaism. Paul advocates justification through faith in Jesus Christ over justification through works of the Law. Under influence of the Lutheran and Reformed perspective, known as sola fide, this was traditionally understood as Paul arguing that Christians' good works would not factor into their salvation ‚Äì only their faith would count. In this perspective, first-century Palestinian Judaism was dismissed as sterile and legalistic. According to Sanders, Paul does not address good works in general, but instead questions only observances such as circumcision, dietary laws, and Sabbath laws, which were the \\"boundary markers\\" that set the Jews apart from the other nations. According to Sanders, first-century Palestinian Judaism was not a \\"legalistic community\\", nor was it oriented to \\"salvation by works\\". Being God's chosen people, they were under his covenant. Contrary to what the Protestants thought, keeping the Law was not a way of entering the covenant, but of staying within the covenant. Development Since the Protestant Reformation (), studies of Paul's writings have been heavily influenced by Lutheran and Reformed views that are said to ascribe the negative attributes that they associated with sixteenth-century Roman Catholicism to Second Temple Judaism. These Lutheran and Reformed views on Paul's writings are called ‚Äúthe old perspective‚Äù by adherents of the \\"new perspective on Paul\\". The \\"new perspective\\" is an attempt to lift Paul's letters out of the Lutheran-Reformed framework and interpret them based on what is said to be an understanding of first-century Judaism, taken on its own terms. In 1963 the Lutheran theologian Krister Stendahl, who is considered by modern scholarship to have been as influential as Sanders in the development of the ‚Äúnew perspective on Paul‚Äù, published a paper arguing that the typical Lutheran view of the Apostle Paul's theology did not fit with statements in Paul's writings, and in fact was based more on mistaken assumptions about Paul's beliefs than careful interpretation of his writings. Stendahl warned against imposing modern Western ideas on the Bible, and especially on the works of Paul. In 1977 E. P. Sanders published Paul and Palestinian Judaism.. In this work he studies Jewish literature and Paul's writings, arguing that the traditional Lutheran understanding of the theology of Judaism and Paul was fundamentally incorrect. Sanders continued to publish books and articles in this field, and was soon joined by the scholar James D. G. Dunn. Dunn reports that Anglican theologian N.T. Wright was the first to use the term ‚Äúnew perspective on Paul‚Äù in his 1978 Tyndale Lecture.N. T. Wright, . SPCK, 2009. The term became more widely known after being used by Dunn as the title of his 1982 Manson Memorial Lecture where he summarized and affirmed the movement.Richard N. Longenecker, . Eerdmans, 2011. The work of these writers inspired a large number of scholars to study, discuss, and debate the relevant issues. Many books and articles dealing with the issues raised have since been published. N.T. Wright has written a large number of works aimed at popularising the ‚Äúnew perspective‚Äù outside of academia.For example, The ‚Äúnew- perspective‚Äù movement is closely connected with a surge of recent scholarly interest in studying the Bible in the context of other ancient texts, and the use of social-scientific methods to understand ancient culture. Scholars affiliated with The Context Group have called for various reinterpretations of biblical texts based on studies of the ancient world.  Main ideas  It is often noted that the singular title \\"the new perspective\\" gives an unjustified impression of unity. It is a field of study in which many scholars are actively pursuing research and continuously revising their own theories in light of new evidence, and who do not necessarily agree with each other on any given issue. It has been suggested by many that a plural title of \\"new perspectives\\" may therefore be more accurate. In 2003, N. T. Wright, distancing himself from both Sanders and Dunn, commented that \\"there are probably almost as many 'new' perspective positions as there are writers espousing it ‚Äì and I disagree with most of them\\".N. T. Wright, New Perspectives. There are certain trends and commonalities within the movement, but what is held in common is the belief that the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives of Paul the Apostle and Judaism are fundamentally incorrect. The following are some of the issues being widely discussed. = Works of the Law = Paul's letters contain a substantial amount of criticism of \\"works of the Law\\". The radical difference in these two interpretations of what Paul meant by \\"works of the Law\\" is the most consistent distinguishing feature between the two perspectives. The historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives interpret this phrase as referring to human effort to do good works in order to meet God's standards (Works Righteousness). In this view, Paul is arguing against the idea that humans can merit salvation from God by their good works alone (note that the \\"new\\" perspective agrees that we cannot merit salvation; the issue is what exactly Paul is addressing). By contrast, new-perspective scholars see Paul as talking about \\"badges of covenant membership\\" or criticizing Gentile believers who had begun to rely on the Torah to reckon Jewish kinship.For \\"badges of covenant membership\\", see N. T. Wright, Paul for Everyone: Romans part one (Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 2004), 35‚Äì41. 5. For reliance on the Torah to reckon Jewish kinship, see It is argued that in Paul's time, Israelites were being faced with a choice of whether to continue to follow their ancestral customs, the Torah, or to follow the Roman Empire's trend to adopt Greek customs (Hellenization, see also Antinomianism, Hellenistic Judaism, and Circumcision controversy in early Christianity). The new-perspective view is that Paul's writings discuss the comparative merits of following ancient Israelite or ancient Greek customs. Paul is interpreted as being critical of a common Jewish view that following traditional Israelite customs makes a person better off before God, pointing out that Abraham was righteous before the Torah was given. Paul identifies customs he is concerned about as circumcision, dietary laws, and observance of special days.Dunn, James D. 'The New Perspective on Paul', 104, 2005. = Human effort and good works = Due to their interpretation of the phrase \\"works of the law\\", theologians of the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives see Paul's rhetoric as being against human effort to earn righteousness. This is often cited by Lutheran and Reformed theologians as a central feature of the Christian religion, and the concepts of grace alone and faith alone are of great importance within the creeds of these denominations. \\"New-perspective\\" interpretations of Paul tend to result in Paul having nothing negative to say about the idea of human effort or good works, and saying many positive things about both. New-perspective scholars point to the many statements in Paul's writings that specify the criteria of final judgment as being the works of the individual. Wright however does not hold the view that good works contribute to one's salvation but rather that the final judgment is something we can look forward to as a future vindication of God's present declaration of our righteousness. In other words, our works are a result of our salvation and the future judgment will show that.. Others tend to place a higher value on the importance of good works than the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives do, taking the view that they causally contribute to the salvation of the individual. Advocates of the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives often see this as being \\"salvation by works\\", and as a bad thing, contradicting fundamental tenets of Christianity. New-perspective scholars often respond that their views are not so different. For in the perspective of Luther and Calvin, God graciously empowers the individual to the faith which leads to salvation and also to good works, while in the \\"new\\" perspective God graciously empowers individuals to the faith (demonstrated in good works), which leads to salvation. See also Synergism in theosis in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Orthopraxy in Christianity. = Pistis Christou ‚Äì 'faith in', or 'faithfulness of' = An ongoing debate related to the \\"new\\" perspective has been over Paul's use of the Greek word pistis (œÄŒØœÉœÑŒπœÇ, meaning \\"trust\\", \\"belief\\", \\"faith\\", or \\"faithfulness\\"). Writers with a more historic Lutheran and Reformed perspective have typically interpreted this word as meaning a belief in God and Christ, and trust in Christ for salvation with faith that he will save you. This interpretation is based on several passages from the Christian Bible, notably the epistle to the Ephesians: \\"For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast\\" (Eph. 2:9). E. P. Sanders has conceded that Ephesians 2:9 teaches the traditional perspective. By contrast, many recent studies of the Greek word pistis have concluded that its primary and most common meaning was faithfulness, meaning firm commitment in an interpersonal relationship.Douglas A. Campbell, \\"The Quest For Paul‚Äôs Gospel: A Suggested Strategy\\", 2005, pp. 178‚Äì207Pilch and Malina, \\"Handbook of Biblical Social Values\\", 1998, pg 72‚Äì75 As such, the word could be almost synonymous with \\"obedience\\" when the people in the relationship held different status levels (e.g. a slave being faithful to his master). Far from being equivalent to \\"lack of human effort\\", the word seems to imply and require human effort. The interpretation of Paul's writings that we need \\"faithfully\\" to obey God's commands is quite different from one which sees him saying that we need to have \\"faith\\" that he will do everything for us. This is also argued to explain why James was adamant that \\"faith without works is dead\\" and that \\"a man is justified by works, and not by faith alone\\" (Js. 2:24), while also saying that merely to believe places one on the same level as the demons (see James 2). The \\"new\\" perspective argues that James was concerned with those who were trying to reduce faith to an intellectual subscription without any intent to follow God or Jesus, and that Paul always intended \\"faith\\" to mean a full submission to God. Another related issue is the pistis Christou (\\"faith of Christ\\") debate. Paul several times uses this phrase at key points in his writings and it is linguistically ambiguous as to whether it refers to our faith in Christ (\\"objective genitive\\"), or Christ's own faithfulness to God (\\"subjective genitive\\"), or even our faith/faithfulness to God like that which Christ had (\\"adjectival genitive\\"). There is wide disagreement within the academic community over which of these is the best rendering.See, e.g.: for subjective genitive:  For objective genitive: * * The NET Bible translation became the first mainstream English Bible translation to use a subjective genitive translation (\\"the faithfulness of Jesus Christ\\") of this phrase.E.g., Romans 3:21‚Äì22: 'But now apart from the law the righteousness of God (which is attested by the law and the prophets) has been disclosed ‚Äì namely, the righteousness of God through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ for all who believe. ...' (emphasis added. Also see Gal. 2:20). = Grace, or favor = Writers with a more historic Lutheran and Reformed perspective have generally translated the Greek word charis as \\"grace\\" and understood it to refer to the idea that there is a lack of human effort in salvation because God is the controlling factor. However those who study ancient Greek culture have pointed out that \\"favor\\" is a better translation, as the word refers normally to \\"doing a favor\\". In ancient societies there was the expectation that such favors be repaid, and this semi-formal system of favors acted like loans.David A.deSilva, Honor, Patronage, Kinship and Purity: Unlocking New Testament Culture, 2000, pg 117 Gift giving corresponded with the expectation of reciprocity.B. J. Oropeza, \\"The Expectation of Grace,\\" Bulletin for Biblical Research 24.2 (2014) 207-226 Therefore, it is argued that when Paul speaks of how God did us a \\"favor\\" by sending Jesus, he is saying that God took the initiative, but is not implying a lack of human effort in salvation, and is in fact implying that Christians have an obligation to repay the favor God has done for them. Some argue that this view then undermines the initial \\"favor\\"‚Äîof sending Jesus‚Äîby saying that, despite his life, death and resurrection, Christians still have, as before, to earn their way to heaven. However, others note this is the horns of a false dilemma (all grace versus all works). Many new-perspective proponents that see \\"charis\\" as \\"favor\\" do not teach that Christians earn their way to heaven outside of the death of Christ. Forgiveness of sins through the blood of Christ is still necessary to salvation. But, that forgiveness demands effort on the part of the individual (cf. Paul in Phil. 3:12‚Äì16). = The Atonement = To writers of the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives the penal substitution atonement theory and the belief in the \\"finished work\\" of Christ have been central. New-perspective writers have regularly questioned whether this view is really of such central importance in Paul's writings. Generally new-perspective writers have argued that other theories of the atonement are more central to Paul's thinking, but there has been minimal agreement among them as to what Paul's real view of the atonement might be. The following is a broad sample of different views advocated by various scholars: * E. P. Sanders argued that Paul's central idea was that we mystically spiritually participate in the risen Christ and that all Paul's judicial language was subordinate to the participatory language. * N. T. Wright has argued that Paul sees Israel as representative of humanity and taking onto itself the sinfulness of humanity through history. Jesus, in turn, as Messiah is representative of Israel and so focuses the sins of Israel on himself on the cross. Wright's view is thus a \\"historicized\\" form of Penal Substitution.N. T. Wright, \\"Jesus and the Victory of God\\" * Chris VanLandingham has argued that Paul sees Christ as having defeated the Devil and as teaching humans how God wants them to live and setting them an example.Chris VanLandingham, \\"Judgment and Justification in Early Judaism and the Apostle Paul\\", Hendrickson 2006 * David Brondos has argued that Paul sees Jesus as just a part in a wider narrative in which the Church is working to transform lives of individuals and the world, and that Paul's participatory language should be understood in an ethical sense (humans living Christ-like lives) rather than mystically as Sanders thought.David Brondos, \\"Paul on the Cross: Reconstructing the Apostle's Story of Redemption\\", Fortress Press, 2006 * Pilch and Malina take the view that Paul holds to the Satisfaction theory of atonement.Bruce J. Malina and John J. Pilch, \\"Social-Science Commentary on the Letters of Paul\\" Augsburg Fortress 2006 * Stephen Finlan holds that Paul uses numerous different metaphors to describe the atonement; ‚Äújustified by his blood‚Äù (Rom 5:9) means that a cultic substance has a judicial effect. Paul also taught the transformation of believers into the image of God through Christ (Theosis).Stephen Finlan, Problems with Atonement: The Origins of, and Controversy about, the Atonement Doctrine, Liturgical Press 2005, pp. 58‚Äì59, 120‚Äì23.  Criticism  The \\"new\\" perspective has been an extremely controversial subject and has drawn strong arguments and recriminations from both sides of the debate. In 2003 Steve Chalke, after being influenced by new-perspective writers, published a book targeted at a popular audience which made comments highly critical of the penal substitution theory of the atonement.. This caused an extensive and ongoing controversy among Evangelicals in Britain, with a strong backlash from laypeople and advocates of the Lutheran and Reformed traditions.Ashworth, Pat. \\"Atonement row gets personal as Evangelical partnership splits\\", 'Church Times', 27 April 2007. Chalke's views drew much support as well as criticism, with numerous articles, blogs and books being written on both sides of the debate. The continuing controversy led to the Evangelical Alliance organising a symposium in July 2005 to discuss the issue. A record of this symposium includes a chapter by Chalke and his views are also contained in \\"the atonement debate\\". A group of three conservative evangelical theologians responded to Chalke with their book, Pierced for our Transgressions (Crossway Publishing, 2007), which strongly criticised Chalke's position as inconsistent with some evangelical confessions of faith. However, N. T. Wright endorsed Chalke and spoke out against the latter book, commenting, for instance, that ‚Äòdespite the ringing endorsements of famous men, it [Pierced For Our Transgressions] is deeply, profoundly, and disturbingly unbiblical.‚Äô Both sides of the debate have attempted to claim the higher, and more accurate, view of scripture. New-perspective advocates claim that supporters of the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspective are too committed to historic Protestant tradition, and therefore fail to take a \\"natural\\" reading of the Bible; while those of the Lutheran and Reformed perspectives claim that new- perspective advocates are too intrigued by certain interpretations of context and history, which then lead to a biased hermeneutical approach to the text. The \\"new\\" perspective has been heavily criticized by conservative scholars in the Reformed tradition, arguing that it undermines the classical, individualistic, Augustinian interpretation of election and does not faithfully reflect the teachings of the Scriptures. It has been the subject of fierce debate among Evangelicals in recent years, mainly due to N. T. Wright's increasing popularity in evangelical circles. Its most outspoken critics include Calvinists John Piper,John Piper, Interview with Piper on Wright, October 11, 2007.

Carson Don Carson on the New Perspective, MP3 file of lecture Tom Holland,Tom Holland Contours of Pauline Theology Ligon Duncan.J. Ligon Duncan, The Attractions of the New Perspective(s) on Paul. Barry D. Smith has claimed that the New Perspective's challenge to the traditional view of Jewish faith practice as legalistic is misplaced.Barry D. Smith, 'The Tension Between God as Righteous Judge and as Merciful in Early Judaism‚Äô, What Must I Do to Be Saved? Paul Parts Company with His Jewish Heritage. In 2015 John M.G. Barclay published Paul and the Gift which re-frames Paul's theology of grace and, in doing so, provides a nuanced critique of the New Perspective. The book has been praised for keeping grace at the center of Paul's theology (pace the New Perspective) while illuminating how grace, understood in light of ancient theories of gift, demands reciprocity and thus the formation of new communities based not on ethnicity but the unqualified Christ-gift (much like the New Perspective).  Catholic and Orthodox reactions  The \\"new\\" perspective has, by and large, been an internal debate among Protestant scholars. Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox writers have generally responded favorably to new-perspective ideas,Despotis, A., Die ‚ÄûNew Perspective on Paul‚Äú und die griechisch-orthodoxe Paulusinterpretation, [VIOTh 11], St. Ottilien: EOS-Verlag 2014, seeing both a greater commonality with their own beliefs and strong similarities with the views of many of the early Church Fathers. From a Catholic point of view, the \\"new\\" perspective is seen as a step toward the progressive reality of human salvation in Christ. The increased importance new-perspective writers have given to good works in salvation has created strong common ground with the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. Historic Protestantism has never denied that there is a place for good and faithful works, but has always excluded them from justification, which Protestants argue is through faith alone, and to which good deeds do not contribute, whether with or without God's grace. This has, since the Reformation, been a line of distinction between Protestantism (both Reformed and Lutheran) and other Christian communions.

The small radiator was fitted behind the grill between the two headlights. It featured 12-volt electric start and CVT transmission; the transmission changed from low to high at around 5500 rpm. It had an automatic centrifugal clutch that engaged gradually from 3000 rpm. It was made to carry only one person at a time and had no provisions for a passenger. It featured V-TACS; this was a small valve in the exhaust port that was operated (closed to activate) by a lever via the rider's left heel. Many other larger two-stroke engines use a similar system although most are engaged automatically by electric servos. V-TACS gave it more power from 5500 rpm (but it also made less power if engaged below 5500 rpm). An expansion chamber and tuned length exhaust were fitted from factory although they were only \\"average\\" in design. Top speed was about @ 11,000 rpm. Both front and back brakes were drum brakes. The dashboard had a tachometer (rpm), a speedometer, and gauges for engine temperature and fuel level. A small set of lights on the rpm dial illuminated when V-tacs was engaged; other lights on the dash lit up for turn signal, oil low (two-stroke oil) and high beam (head lights). A small light on the speed dial flashed when speed exceeded 35 km/h.

Early life McGrath was born in London and grew up near Broadmoor Hospital from the age of five where his father was Medical Superintendent.Foreword to Penguin edition of Asylum publ 1996 He was educated at a Jesuit boarding school in Windsor from the age of thirteen, before moving to another Jesuit public school, Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, upon the closure of his first school. In 1967, at the age of sixteen, he ran away from this institution to London. He graduated from the Birmingham College of Commerce with an honours degree in English and American literature in 1971, awarded externally by the University of London, before his father found him a job later that year in Penetang, Ontario working in the Oakridge top-security unit of the Penetang Mental Health Centre. He has lived in various parts of North America and also spent several years on a remote island in the North Pacific, before finally settling in New York City in 1981. McGrath also worked as a teacher of creative writing to undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Texas at Austin in the fall semester of 2006. He also taught craft courses for a number of years in the MFA program at Hunter College, New York, and since 2007, has taught an MFA program at the New School in New York. His archive was acquired by the University of Stirling, Scotland. Career His fiction is principally characterised by the first person unreliable narrator, and recurring subject matter in his work includes mental illness, repressed homosexuality and adulterous relationships. His novel Martha Peake won the Premio Flaiano Prize in Italy and Asylum was shortlisted for the 1996 Guardian Fiction Prize. He is also currently on the writing faculties of both the New School in New York and Princeton University. Professor Emeritus of Creative Writing at Princeton, Joyce Carol Oates, makes the case that McGrath is transcribing the \\"nightmares of the 'shattered personality' that resonate within us all,\\" calling his short stories \\"masterful and seductive, ... Bold, original, and disquieting tales are told by narrators who are themselves bizarre (a boot, a fly‚Äîto name just two) and are in most cases omniscient.\\" On 27 June 2018, the University of Stirling, Scotland, conferred on him the degree of Doctor of the University \\"for Patrick McGrath's outstanding support of academic research.\\" Personal life He is married to actress Maria Aitken and divides his time between London and New York City. He is the oldest of four siblings.

He was an expert on wildflowers and authored several guides for amateur naturalists. Life Fitter was born in London, England, on 1 March 1913 and was educated at Eastbourne College and the London School of Economics. He was the only son of Sidney and Dorothy Fitter. In 1938 he married Alice Mary (Maisie) Stewart (died 1996) and they had two sons and a daughter. He was recruited to the Institute for Political and Economic Planning in 1936, and in 1940 moved to the social research organisation Mass- Observation to investigate civilian morale for the Ministry of Information. During the Second World War he worked at the Operations research section of the RAF Coastal Command. During this time he worked for two hours each evening on a comprehensive urban natural history of London, which was published in May 1945 as London's Natural History, his first book. After the war in 1945 he was appointed secretary of the Wildlife Conservation Special Committee of the Ministry of Town and Country Planning, which made proposals for nature conservation as part of the reconstruction after the war. In 1946, Fitter became assistant editor of The Countryman and moved from London to Burford, Oxfordshire, where his writing career flourished. In later life he moved to Great Shelford, Cambridge. He died in Cambridge on 3 September 2005, survived by his children. Work Fitter wrote many books and was active in various areas relating to nature and conservation. His wife Maisie was a colleague and collaborator on many of his researches. They were joint authors of The Penguin Dictionary of British Natural History (1967). His son, Alastair Fitter, is a professor of biology at the University of York. They collaborated on three books: Guide to the Countryside (1984; Field Guide to the Freshwater Life of Britain and NW Europe (1986); and Wild Flowers of Britain and Ireland (2003). In 2002 father and son jointly authored a paper in Science analysing the changing phenology of plant flowering times due to global warming. He wrote the Collins Pocket Guide to British Birds (1952), which started a series of field guides by various authors, setting a style which was helpful to the inexperienced observer by the way it was organised and explained, placing short texts alongside pictures. This had birds grouped according to habitat, size and colour, rather than the biological classification which traditional books had done. His Pocket Guide to Wild Flowers (with David McClintock,1956) had pictures grouped by colour for easier identification. His Fontana Wild Flower Guide (1957) showed which plants might be found in different counties. He was heavily involved with nature conservation organisations including the Council for Nature, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and the Fauna and Flora Preservation Society (now Fauna and Flora International) where he was Honorary Secretary. He also served on the councils of the RSPB and the British Trust for Ornithology, and founded the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Naturalists' Trust. In 1968 he was one of the founders of the British Deer Society, which aimed to help with study, management and control. He was also involved in the search for the Loch Ness Monster, being a director of the Loch Ness Investigation Bureau.1969 Annual Report: Loch Ness Investigation Honours *Order of the Golden Ark in the Netherlands (1978) *Peter Scott Medal from the British Naturalists' Association (1998) *Christopher Cadbury Medal from the Royal Society for Nature Conservation. In 2008 the British Naturalists' Association instituted a Richard Fitter Memorial Medal which is awarded annually to an individual who is a dedicated active field naturalist. Hobbies Fitter collected 'bird inn signs.' He wrote about his hobby in the Birmingham Daily Post, published Tuesday 22 March 1955. Fitter wrote that \\"I just note them down in my diary whenever I see them. I started during the second winter of the war, as a kind of light relief from the somewhat grim preoccupations of those days.\\" By 1955 Fitter had several hundred signs in his collection of some 38 different bird species. https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000619/19550322/326/0015 Birmingham Daily Post - Tuesday 22 March 1955 Bibliography * London's Natural History 1945 New Naturalist no 3. * London's Birds (Collins) 1949 * Home Counties (About Britain Series; No.3) 1951 * Contributions to the Bibliography of the Natural History of the London Area: No.2: a Subject Index of the Society's Journals, 1941‚Äì51 1952 * The Pocket Guide to British Birds (illustrated by Richard Richardson) 1952 * Birds of Town and Village (Collins Naturalist Series) 1953 * The Natural History of the City 1953 * The Pocket Guide to Nests and Eggs 1955 * Fontana Bird Guide (Fontana series) 1956 * Pocket Guide to Wild Flowers (with David McClintock) 1956 * Fontana Wild Flower Guide 1957 * Your Book of Bird Watching 1958 * The Ark in Our Midst: The Story of the Introduced Animals af Britain; Birds, Beasts, Reptiles, Amphibians, Fishes 1959 * The 'Countryman' nature book: An anthology from 'The Countryman' 1960 * Your Book About Wild Flowers 1960 * Collins Guide to Bird Watching (illustrated by Richard Richardson) 1963 * Fitters Rural Rides: 'The Observer' Illustrated Map-Guide to the Countryside 1963 * Wildlife in Britain (Pelican books) 1963 * Wildlife ‚Äì and Death (Take Home Books) 1964 * Britain's wildlife: Rarities and Introductions 1966 * Pocket Guide to British Birds (with Richard Richardson) 1966 * The Penguin Dictionary of British Natural History (with Maisie Fitter) 1967 * Pocket Guide to Nests and Eggs 1968 * Vanishing Wild Animals of the World 1968 * Guide to Bird Watching 1970 * Contributed section on Mammals to \\"The Shell Natural History of Britain\\" 1970 * Finding Wild Flowers 1971 * Birds of Britain and Europe with North Africa and the Middle East (with illustrations by Hermann Heinzel and maps by John Parslow) 1972 * The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast (with William Plomer, illustrations by Alan Aldridge) 1973 * Wild Flowers of Britain and Northern Europe (Collins Pocket Guide) (with Alastair Fitter, Marjorie Blamey)1974 * Penitent Butchers: The Fauna Preservation Society 1903‚Äì1978 (with Sir Peter Scott) 1978 * Collins Gem Wild Flowers (with Marjorie Blamey) 1980 * The Complete Guide to British Wildlife (with Alastair Fitter, illustrated by Norman Arlott) * Grasses, Sedges, Rushes & Ferns of Britain and Northern Europe (Collins Pocket Guide) (with Alastair Fitter, Ann Farrer) 1984 * Collins Guide to the Countryside (with Alastair Fitter) 1984 * Contributed the article on 'Naturalized Birds' to A Dictionary of Birds (edited by Bruce Campbell & Elizabeth Lack 1985 * Wild Life of the Thames Counties (Ed) 1985 * A Field Guide to Freshwater Life in Britain and North-west Europe (Collins Field Guide) (with Richard Manuel) 1986 * Wild Life for Man (with Norman Arlott) 1986 * Collins Guide to the Countryside in Winter (Collins Handguide) (with Alastair Fitter) 1988 * Wild Flowers (Collins Gem Series) (with Martin Walters) 1999 * The Wild Flowers of Britain and Ireland: The Complete Guide to the British and Irish Flora (with Alastair Fitter, Marjorie Blamey) 2003 =As editor= * =Journals= * \\"Rapid Changes in Flowering Time in British Plants\\" (with A.

Umbrisols are the counterpart of comparable soils with a high base saturation (Chernozems, Kastanozems and Phaeozems). Umbrisols develop in weathering material of siliceous rock. They are found in mostly cool humid climates in mountainous regions with little or no moisture deficit, including tropical and subtropical mountains. Many Umbrisols are under a natural or near-natural vegetation cover. Umbrisols occur above the actual tree line in the Andean, Himalayan and Central Asian mountain ranges; they are at lower altitudes in northern and western Europe where the former forest vegetation has been largely cleared, carry a vegetation of short grasses of low nutritional value. Coniferous forest predominates in Brazil (and in the United States). Umbrisols in tropical mountain areas in South Asia and Oceania are under montane evergreen forest. In the mountains of southern Mexico, the vegetation varies from tropical semi- deciduous forest to much cooler montane cloud forest. Contour terraces and grassed waterways used for erosion control in Kansas. The predominance of sloping land and wet and cool climate conditions restricts utilization of many Umbrisols to extensive grazing. Management focuses on the introduction of improved grasses and correction of the soil pH by liming. Many Umbrisols are susceptible to erosion. The planting of perennial crops and bench or contour terracing offer possibilities for permanent agriculture on gentler slopes. Where conditions are suitable, cash crops may be grown, e.g. cereals and root crops in the US, Europe and South America, or tea and cinchona in Indonesia. Highland coffee on Umbrisols demands high management inputs to meet its stringent nutrient requirements. In New Zealand, Umbrisols have been transformed into highly productive soils, used for intensive sheep and dairy farming, and production of cash crops. Distribution Distribution of umbrisols. Umbrisols occupy about throughout the world. In South America, Umbrisols are common in the Andean ranges of Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia and Peru. They also occur in Brazil, in Lesotho and in South Africa. Umbrisols in North America are confined largely to the northwest Pacific seaboard. In Europe, Umbrisols occur along the northwest Atlantic seaboard, e.g. in Iceland, on the British Isles and in northwest Portugal and Spain. In Asia, they are found in the mountain ranges east and west of Lake Baikal, and on fringes of the Himalayas, notably in India, Nepal, China and Burma. Umbrisols occur at lower altitudes in eastern India, in Burma and in Sumatra. In Oceania, Umbrisols are found in the mountain ranges of Papua New Guinea and southeast Australia and in the eastern parts of South Island, New Zealand. Related terminology \\"Umbrisol\\" is a Reference Soil Group of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB). Many of such soils are classified in the USDA soil taxonomy as Great Groups of Entisols and Inceptisols, and as \\"Very dark-humus soils\\" in the Russian soil classification.

There is no reference to the Army within the official title of the NZCC, but an army theme is used for the NZCC. All of its members, from the cadets themselves to the officers and the support committees are civilian volunteers. Members have no obligation to head into the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF); however, some do choose to join the NZDF. Organisation =National= The NZCC is managed at a national level by the commandant (usually a Regular Force Lieutenant colonel / Wing commander / Commander), and his/her staff at Defence Force Headquarters in Wellington. (The current commandant is Commander Andrew Law, RNZN). =Area= The country is broken into 3 areas, Northern (Northern half of the North Island), Central (Southern half of the North Island) and Southern (entire South Island). Each area has a NZCF training and support unit, commanded by an area co-ordinator, with advisors for New Zealand Cadet Corps units. =Unit= Each unit is led and managed by the cadet unit commander, and his/her officers and staff. There are currently 36 New Zealand Cadet Corps units in New Zealand. Uniform and Insignia An example of the NZCC SDAR uniform An example of the NZCC DPM uniform The uniform worn by NZCC members is the same as that of the New Zealand Army, except that for all ranks, the lettering on the bottom of the rank insignia shoulder boards reads CADET FORCES rather than NEW ZEALAND to differentiate NZCC personnel from New Zealand Army personnel. Furthermore, NZCC rank insignia are red, a colour no longer used by the New Zealand Army for rank insignia. Officer service dress uniforms have a shoulder flash reading NEW ZEALAND CADET FORCES, rather than NEW ZEALAND for the same reason. The cadets wear a NZCF cap badge (same as NZCC logo) on their beret, Cadets wear their achievements on a shoulder brassard. Officers who were formerly cadets do not wear their cadet awards on the officer uniform.. Uniforms worn by the New Zealand Cadet Forces: * Service dress all ranks (SDAR) * New Zealand Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM) Furthermore the New Zealand Cadet Corps plans to get the new New Zealand Multi Terrain Pattern uniform when released in a joint purchase with the NZDF instead of going to MCU's. This is due to the many problems the MCU uniform has meaning NZDPM's and the new NZMTP's are better overall. { style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin:0 12px 12px 0; margin:auto; width:100%; text-align:center;\\" + Officer Ranks and Insignia in the NZCC  } { style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin:0 12px 12px 0; margin:auto; width:100%; text-align:center;\\" + Cadet Ranks and Insignia in the NZCC  } Membership =Cadet members= Cadets can join from the age of 13, and may serve as a cadet or cadet NCO until their 19th birthday. Under officers may serve up until their 22nd birthday. The exception is the sole school-based unit, as opposed to city or regional based units. Hamiltons Fraser High School Cadet Unit permits all students enrolled at Hamiltons Fraser High School to enroll in the unit. Units provide uniform, but may hold bonds to ensure that they are returned. Unit fees are set by each unit Parent Support Committee annually. Due to fluctuating operating costs, these vary from unit to unit. Cadets may in time be promoted to NCO ranks. Cadet NCO ranks are based on the New Zealand Army Infantry ranks, and are * Cadet lance corporal (CDT LCPL), * Cadet corporal (CDT CPL), * Cadet sergeant (CDT SGT), * Cadet staff sergeant (CDT SSGT), * Cadet warrant officer class two (CDT WO2), and Cadets who have received the necessary training, and have the desire and commitment to become an NZCF officer can also serve as under officers. Under officers are officers- in-training and are normally treated as officers, but are, however, not entitled to salutes. * Under officer NZCC (UO, NZCF). The exception is that under officer is not a rank in the NZ Army. The UO rank slide is based upon the Air Force officer cadet rank, and a similar rank is used in the New Zealand Army Officer Cadet School. In the NZCC, NCO ranks are often abbreviated by omitting the \\"cadet\\" prefix. However, not all cadets become NCOs, but all get the chance to train and progress through the different levels of training, Basic, Corps (junior), and Advanced (senior) levels, by demonstrating knowledge of subjects in their training year. =Adult members= Adult members can serve in two capacities: commissioned officers or civilian instructors. Officers are commissioned into the New Zealand Cadet Forces, with the post-nominal letters NZCF, at the rank of second lieutenant, and can be promoted to lieutenant, captain or major after completing the necessary training and service. To reach captain the officer must have served as the commanding officer of a cadet unit, while officers must be an area support officer to be promoted to major. At the end of 2014, the NZCF introduced a new position of national support officer (NSO). If he or she is an NZCC officer, as opposed to an ATC or SCC officer, they will hold the rank of lieutenant colonel. Officers are unpaid volunteers, therefore they receive no pay for routine parades and unit activities. They are paid when attending training courses run by the New Zealand Defence Force. Civilian instructors are civilians who help train cadets. They do not wear uniform, but they are generally treated similarly to officers by cadets. Members of the NZDF are occasionally attached to cadet units to assist in conducting training. This is normally because they know a cadet/officer in that unit, or if they have a particular interest in cadet forces. Activities =Parade nights= Every unit holds parade nights around 2‚Äì3 hours long weekly during school terms. Each parade night usually begins and ends with a parade. The starting parade is used to inspect uniforms, and to inform the cadets on the parade night's activities. The final parade to inform the cadets on upcoming events in the unit. Between the parades, the cadets undergo classroom, or practical instruction. =Bushcraft= A New Zealand Cadet Corps unit on exercise Most units conduct classroom training in bushcraft and survival skills, and hold regular basic and advanced bushcraft camps in the local area during weekends. =Shooting= An NZCC Cadet Firing the JW-15A 0.22 Rifle Units conduct regular range training with smallbore rifles. Some units have their own armouries and ranges at their parade hall. Cadets must pass a TOET (test of elementary training) before being allowed on the range. The rifle used at present is the Marlin XT. =Other activities= * Adventure training * Assault courses * Drill * Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme * First-aid/search & rescue/casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) * General service knowledge/Cadet force knowledge * Initiative * Leadership * Fieldcraft * Navigation * Observation * Radio procedures * Survival * Team Work * Watermanship * Weather reading skills Courses = Tri-Corps courses = * Junior NCO course * Senior NCO course * Cadet shooting coaches course Also, senior cadets and officers may be selected to staff these courses (except for the shooting coaches course) = Officer courses = * Officers' Commissioning course * Instructional technique & management course * Officers' outdoor leaders course * Range safety officer course * NZCF Command course Also, officers may be selected to staff these courses, except for the range safety officer course. NZCC competitions  =Regional Skills Competition= The Regional Skills Competition tests NZCC cadets on a wide range of skills, such as things like GSK & CFK (knowledge of the NZDF and NZCF respectively), rifle shooting, navigation and drill. It is held every year in the Northern, Central and Southern areas. The Northern Area competition is often held at Tamaki Leadership Centre, Central held at RNZAF Base Ohakea and Southern held at Burnham Military Camp. Each competition's winner is then sent on to compete in the National Skills Competition. =National Skills Competition= The National Skills Competition is more in line with New Zealand Army activities than other competitions, and is intended to provide a challenge comparable to an army exercise. It focuses more on fieldcraft and teamwork than the Regional Skills Competition, and also gives more freedom for the team's leader for decision making. It is often held at the Waiouru Military Camp in the central North Island. =Fennell Shooting Competition = The Ffennell competitions are a group of small-bore rifle matches for the youth of the Commonwealth. New Zealand Cadet Forces units contest the Class B competitions (using issued rifles and sights).https://www.cadetnet.org.nz/wp- content/uploads/2018/03/NZCF-160-Competitions-and-Awards-Manual.pdf =Gunson Cup Shooting Trophy = Originally awarded to the best first year cadet .22 rifle team in the School Cadet Corps now is presented to the winning team of the New Zealand Cadet Corps smallbore postal shoot.https://www.cadetnet.org.nz/wp- content/uploads/2018/03/NZCF-160-Competitions-and-Awards-Manual.pdf See also * United Kingdom Army Cadet Force References External links * New Zealand Cadet Forces Web Site Category:Army cadet organisations Cadet Corps, New Zealand Cadet Corps, New Zealand ","title":"New Zealand Cadet Corps"},{"id":"2198940","text":"Bio-Dome is a 1996 American comedy film directed by Jason Bloom. Bio-Dome was produced by Motion Picture Corporation of America on a budget of $15 million and was distributed theatrically by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The plot of the film revolves around two clumsy, dim-witted slackers who, while on a road trip, look for a toilet stop in what they believe is a shopping mall, which turns out to be a \\"bio-dome\\", a form of closed ecological system in which five scientists are to be hermetically sealed for a year. The film has themes of environmentalism, combined with drug use, sexual innuendo, and toilet humor. The film stars Stephen Baldwin and Pauly Shore, and has cameo appearances by celebrities such as Roger Clinton, Kylie Minogue, Patricia Hearst, and Rose McGowan. Jack Black and Kyle Gass first came to global attention in Bio-Dome in which they performed together as Tenacious D on-screen for the first time. The film grossed $13 million at the box office in North America. Bio-Dome was panned by critics, gaining a record low score of 1/100 on Metacritic. On December 18, 2013, Stephen Baldwin appeared on Mancow Muller's radio/TV show, confirming that he is in talks with Pauly Shore about making a sequel to the film revolving around the children of Bud and Doyle, their characters. Plot Bud \\"Squirrel\\" Macintosh and Doyle \\"Stubs\\" Johnson are best friends who live together. Their environmentalist girlfriend, Jen and Monique, stand them up for a date, due to their immaturity. Driving back home, they pass by the Bio-Dome, where scientist Dr. Noah Faulkner is about to seal his team in for a year without outside contact. Mistaking the Bio-Dome for a mall, Bud and Doyle go inside to use the bathroom, only to be sealed in along with the scientists. Dr. Leaky, the project's investor, discovers them and demands that they be kicked out. Dr. Faulkner refuses, claiming it would destroy the purpose of the experiment, and so Bud and Doyle remain. Although things go smoothly at first, this proves to be a mistake, as Bud and Doyle continue their antics, harming themselves and destroying many of the scientists' projects. The scientists plead to Dr. Faulkner, but he only relents after the two find a secret stash of junk food and experiment with laughing gas. Bud and Doyle are then banished to the desert environment section and after three days of being stuck, they discover a key in the lock of one of the windows, which opens a back door, and they escape the Bio-Dome. As Bud and Doyle are receiving a pizza delivery at the dome, they learn Jen and Monique are attending an environmental party with other men. Bud and Doyle decide to outdo the party and hold one inside the Bio-Dome to win them back. The party backfires as it throws the experiment into chaos and Jen and Monique disavow the boys. The scientists prepare to exit out the desert through the door, but realizing their idiotic actions, Bud and Doyle intervene and demand they all stay and restore the dome to full health, arguing that the real world itself is currently not a pristine environment, with Doyle swallowing the key as a last resort. The group gets a grip on the situation and begins to fix the dome together, while the boys and the scientists bond with each other as a team, and Bud and Doyle's efforts in restoring the dome soon draw a large group of fans and supporters, including Monique and Jen. Meanwhile, Dr. Faulkner, who had disappeared the night of the party, has gone insane and is starting plans to blow up the dome with homemade coconut bombs. After several months pass and Earth Day approaches, Bud, Doyle, and the team are successful in restoring the dome. But on the night before the doors open again, Bud and Doyle discover Dr. Faulkner, hoping to apologize to him and make amends. He tells the two that he is rigging pyrotechnics for the door opening ceremony and gets them to help plant the items, not knowing they are really bombs. Once Bud and Doyle are on their own with the bombs, they goof off with one of the coconuts and, after a failed long pass, they discover their dangerous nature. They alert the others and try to exit the dome early, but the door cannot be opened until the clock hits zero, when the bombs will go off. Bud and Doyle run back into the dome to find Dr. Faulkner and get him to deactivate the bombs. After a chase and struggle, they knock him out and use a remote to disable the coconuts. With the Bio-Dome experiment complete, the team gets ready to exit the now open door, but as they begin to walk out, Dr. Faulkner returns with one last coconut bomb, trips, and the bomb detonates at the entrance. Bud, Doyle, Jen and Monique bid farewell to the Bio-Dome scientists and drive off, where Doyle yet again has to use the bathroom and the car is seen driving toward a mysterious nuclear power plant. Dr. Faulkner, meanwhile, has escaped the dome through the desert window door, having retrieved the key Doyle swallowed, and flees through the desert with police in pursuit. Cast Reception =Box office= Bio-Dome grossed $13.4 million in North America, against an estimated production budget of $8.5 million. MGM spent $10 million on marketing. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 4% based on reviews from 25 critics. The critical consensus reads: \\"Like its two obnoxious protagonists, this dreadfully unfunny Pauly Shore vehicle should remain separated from society.\\" On Metacritic it has a score of 1 out of 100 based on reviews from 10 critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". It is one of ten films to hold this rating; the other nine being 10 Rules for Sleeping Around, Chaos, inAPPropriate Comedy, Not Cool, The Singing Forest, The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, Death of a Nation, Hardbodies, and United Passions. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B- on scale of A to F. Leondard Klady of Variety magazine wrote: \\"It‚Äôs not by any means inspired madness. Neither the script nor direction lives up to the concept, and the picture evolves into a ‚ÄúBio‚Äù-degradable hash rather than a zany sendup of potent issues and serious intents gone awry.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a grade F, saying \\"Even with the low expectations any reasonable viewer brings to a Shore flick, this rates only stupid-plus.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times called it \\"inept in almost every respect\\". =Accolades= At the 1996 Golden Raspberry Awards, Shore co-won a Razzie Award for Worst Actor for his work in the film, tied with Tom Arnold for that actor's performances in Big Bully, Carpool and The Stupids. At the 1996 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the movie won two of the movies' three nominations: Worst On-Screen Hairstyle for Stephen Baldwin and Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy. Shore was also nominated for Worst Actor, but lost it to Tom Arnold for his acting in the same three movies (Big Bully, Carpool and The Stupids). Sequel On December 18, 2013, Stephen Baldwin appeared on Mancow Muller's radio/TV show, confirming that he is in talks with Pauly Shore about making a sequel to the film revolving around the children of their characters Bud and Doyle. Baldwin had also stated that he gets recognized more for his role in Bio-Dome than any other film he has done thus far. In an interview published in Variety on January 17, 2017, he reiterated his desire to make a sequel, saying that Shore was interested and he has funding, but is seeking studio approval.

The supporting cast includes Bill Duke, Eric Roberts, Colm Feore, and Matt McCoy. The film was released in January 2003, and grossed over $50 million worldwide at the box office. It was shot at various locations in Greater Los Angeles, including Long Beach and Santa Clarita. Plot Two LAPD policemen, Hank Rafferty and Charlie Reed, investigate a warehouse heist and discover a gang of thieves, one of whom kills Charlie before they escape. Meanwhile, Earl Montgomery's lifelong dream to become a police officer is thwarted when he flunks police academy for accidentally causing an explosion. After Hank receives a warning from Detective Frank McDuff after interfering with the investigation of Charlie's death, he meets Earl when Hank notices him trying to get into his car after locking his keys inside. When Hank questions Earl, Earl race-baits and insults Hank to the point of getting himself arrested. A bumblebee comes along, to which Earl is allergic, causing him to panic. From afar, it appears as if Hank is brutalizing Earl when he is actually attempting to shoo the bee away by swatting it with his baton; a man catches the incident on videotape. Because of the incriminating evidence and a spiteful Earl lying about the accused brutalizing, Hank is terminated from the police force and charged with aggravated assault against Earl. He is sentenced to six months in prison. After being released, Hank takes a job as a security guard and continues investigating Charlie's death. Noticing an alarm being tripped at a soda warehouse, Hank goes to investigate. Earl, who is working for the same security company, is on duty at the warehouse but is slacking off. Hank interrupts the heist, and a gunfight erupts with the thugs, during which Hank and Earl cross paths again. The two give chase to the thieves but are pulled over by the police for speeding. One of the thieves drops a cell phone, which leads them to a semi-trailer truck. Inside the truck, Hank and Earl find the thieves' van. Earl tries to hotwire the van but accidentally triggers the alarm, alerting the thieves. After a brief shootout, Hank and Earl drive the van out of the truck and escape. Inside the van are what look like ordinary beer kegs; Hank has them examined at a foundry, where they learn that the kegs are actually made of an atomic aerospace alloy, which is worth millions. Hank takes the van and the kegs to the house of his ex-girlfriend, Denise. They broke up after Hank was arrested, and Hank asks Earl to tell Denise the truth about the \\"assault\\". Earl promises, but when he sees that Denise is an attractive black woman, he breaks his promise and starts hitting on her, playing the victim again. This causes another fight between them, and Denise kicks both of them out. After a heated argument, Hank punches Earl in the face, before storming off. Later, the pair is cornered by police, learning that they are suspects in the earlier shootout. They escape and Hank realizes that the thieves must have an inside man in the police department. That night, the pair trace the van's owner to an address and stake out the place, but Earl rushes inside on his own and is confronted by the thieves. Hank arrives just as Earl is shot in the leg, and before escaping, he recognizes one of the thieves, Nash, as Charlie's murderer. When Hank takes Earl to Denise to get his wound treated (which turns out to be simply a graze), a bee flies into the house and Earl runs for cover, making Denise realize that Hank's story about the \\"assault\\" on Earl was actually true. She slaps Earl for lying and reconciles with Hank. Based on something overheard from Nash, they follow him to a meeting at a yacht club and witness him talking to McDuff, who is revealed to be Nash's inside man. Hank and Earl share everything they know with Hank's former boss, Lieutenant Washington, and then pretend to approach McDuff, offering to sell him back the \\"beer kegs\\" for $1 million. However, Nash learns about their plans and takes Washington hostage first. During the confrontation the next day, Earl and Hank meet with McDuff, Nash, and their men near the coast, rescuing Washington and accidentally starting a shootout, but the trio manage to kill or apprehend most of Nash's gang, including McDuff. Hank is shot, but he survives and kills Nash by dropping a nearby crane's lifting hook onto an unstable slab of rock that Nash is standing on, catapulting him into the ocean, avenging Charlie‚Äôs death. Six more months later, in honor of their heroic actions, Hank is reinstated in the LAPD and Earl is admitted to the force, and they are made partners. The two encounter a situation similar to where they met, in which a man is apparently locked out of his car. Earl helps the man but learns that he is actually a thief. He successfully stops the thief by shooting at the car, but the vehicle explodes soon after.

With the usual notation \\\\operatorname E; for the expectation operator, if the processes have the mean functions \\\\mu_X(t) = \\\\operatorname \\\\operatorname E[X_t] and \\\\mu_Y(t) = \\\\operatorname E[Y_t], then the cross- covariance is given by :\\\\operatorname{K}_{XY}(t_1,t_2) = \\\\operatorname{cov} (X_{t_1}, Y_{t_2}) = \\\\operatorname{E}[(X_{t_1} - \\\\mu_X(t_1))(Y_{t_2} - \\\\mu_Y(t_2))] = \\\\operatorname{E}[X_{t_1} Y_{t_2}] - \\\\mu_X(t_1) \\\\mu_Y(t_2).\\\\, Cross-covariance is related to the more commonly used cross-correlation of the processes in question. In the case of two random vectors \\\\mathbf{X}=(X_1, X_2, \\\\ldots , X_p)^{\\\\rm T} and \\\\mathbf{Y}=(Y_1, Y_2, \\\\ldots , Y_q)^{\\\\rm T}, the cross-covariance would be a p \\\\times q matrix \\\\operatorname{K}_{XY} (often denoted \\\\operatorname{cov}(X,Y)) with entries \\\\operatorname{K}_{XY}(j,k) = \\\\operatorname{cov}(X_j, Y_k).\\\\, Thus the term cross-covariance is used in order to distinguish this concept from the covariance of a random vector \\\\mathbf{X}, which is understood to be the matrix of covariances between the scalar components of \\\\mathbf{X} itself. In signal processing, the cross- covariance is often called cross-correlation and is a measure of similarity of two signals, commonly used to find features in an unknown signal by comparing it to a known one. It is a function of the relative time between the signals, is sometimes called the sliding dot product, and has applications in pattern recognition and cryptanalysis. Cross-covariance of random vectors Cross- covariance of stochastic processes The definition of cross-covariance of random vector may be generalized to stochastic processes as follows: =Definition= Let \\\\\\\\{ X(t) \\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{ Y(t) \\\\\\\\} denote stochastic processes. Then the cross-covariance function of the processes K_{XY} is defined by:Kun Il Park, Fundamentals of Probability and Stochastic Processes with Applications to Communications, Springer, 2018, 978-3-319-68074-3 cellpadding= 6 border border colour = #0073CF background colour=#F5FFFA}} where \\\\mu_X(t) = \\\\operatorname{E}\\\\left[X(t)\\\\right] and \\\\mu_Y(t) = \\\\operatorname{E}\\\\left[Y(t)\\\\right]. If the processes are complex stochastic processes, the second factor needs to be complex conjugated. :\\\\operatorname{K}_{XY}(t_1,t_2) \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\operatorname{cov} (X_{t_1}, Y_{t_2}) = \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left[ \\\\left( X(t_1)- \\\\mu_X(t_1) \\\\right) \\\\overline{\\\\left( Y(t_2)- \\\\mu_Y(t_2) \\\\right)} \\\\right] =Definition for jointly WSS processes= If \\\\left\\\\\\\\{X_t\\\\right\\\\\\\\} and \\\\left\\\\\\\\{Y_t\\\\right\\\\\\\\} are a jointly wide-sense stationary, then the following are true: :\\\\mu_X(t_1) = \\\\mu_X(t_2) \\\\triangleq \\\\mu_X for all t_1,t_2, :\\\\mu_Y(t_1) = \\\\mu_Y(t_2) \\\\triangleq \\\\mu_Y for all t_1,t_2 and :\\\\operatorname{K}_{XY}(t_1,t_2) = \\\\operatorname{K}_{XY}(t_2 - t_1,0) for all t_1,t_2 By setting \\\\tau = t_2 - t_1 (the time lag, or the amount of time by which the signal has been shifted), we may define :\\\\operatorname{K}_{XY}(\\\\tau) = \\\\operatorname{K}_{XY}(t_2 - t_1) \\\\triangleq \\\\operatorname{K}_{XY}(t_1,t_2). The cross-covariance function of two jointly WSS processes is therefore given by: which is equivalent to :\\\\operatorname{K}_{XY}(\\\\tau) = \\\\operatorname{cov} (X_{t+\\\\tau}, Y_{t}) = \\\\operatorname{E}[(X_{t+ \\\\tau} - \\\\mu_X)(Y_{t} - \\\\mu_Y)] = \\\\operatorname{E}[X_{t+\\\\tau} Y_t] - \\\\mu_X \\\\mu_Y. =Uncorrelatedness= Two stochastic processes \\\\left\\\\\\\\{X_t\\\\right\\\\\\\\} and \\\\left\\\\\\\\{Y_t\\\\right\\\\\\\\} are called uncorrelated if their covariance \\\\operatorname{K}_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\mathbf{Y}}(t_1,t_2) is zero for all times. Formally: :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{X_t\\\\right\\\\\\\\},\\\\left\\\\\\\\{Y_t\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\text{ uncorrelated} \\\\quad \\\\iff \\\\quad \\\\operatorname{K}_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\mathbf{Y}}(t_1,t_2) = 0 \\\\quad \\\\forall t_1,t_2. Cross-covariance of deterministic signals The cross- covariance is also relevant in signal processing where the cross-covariance between two wide-sense stationary random processes can be estimated by averaging the product of samples measured from one process and samples measured from the other (and its time shifts). The samples included in the average can be an arbitrary subset of all the samples in the signal (e.g., samples within a finite time window or a sub-sampling of one of the signals). For a large number of samples, the average converges to the true covariance. Cross-covariance may also refer to a \\"deterministic\\" cross-covariance between two signals. This consists of summing over all time indices. For example, for discrete-time signals f[k] and g[k] the cross-covariance is defined as :(f\\\\star g)[n] \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\sum_{k\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}} \\\\overline{f[k]} g[n+k] = \\\\sum_{k\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}} \\\\overline{f[k-n]} g[k] where the line indicates that the complex conjugate is taken when the signals are complex-valued. For continuous functions f(x) and g(x) the (deterministic) cross-covariance is defined as :(f\\\\star g)(x) \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\int \\\\overline{f(t)} g(x+t)\\\\,dt = \\\\int \\\\overline{f(t-x)} g(t)\\\\,dt. = Properties = The (deterministic) cross-covariance of two continuous signals is related to the convolution by :(f \\\\star g)(t) = (\\\\overline{f(-\\\\tau)}*g(\\\\tau))(t) and the (deterministic) cross-covariance of two discrete-time signals is related to the discrete convolution by :(f \\\\star g)[n] = (\\\\overline{f[-k]}*g[k])[n].

It is usually caused by the ingestion of a sharp, metallic object. These pieces of metal settle in the reticulum and can irritate or penetrate the lining. It is most common in dairy cattle, but is occasionally seen in beef cattle. It is very rarely reported in any other ruminants. It can be difficult to conclusively diagnose, but can be prevented by the oral administration of a magnet around the time that the animal reaches the age of one year.  Causes  Cattle commonly swallow foreign objects, because they do not use their lips to discriminate between materials and they do not completely chew their feed before swallowing. Sharp metallic objects, such as nails or wire, are the common initiators of hardware disease. The object travels into the rumen and is then pushed into the reticulum along with the rest of the feed. In some cases, contractions of the reticulum can push the object through part of the reticulum wall into the peritoneal cavity, where it causes severe inflammation. In rare cases, the metal object penetrates the entire wall of the reticulum and can pierce the heart sac, causing pericarditis. Compression by the uterus in late pregnancy, straining during parturition and mounting during estrus can increase the likelihood of the object penetrating the abdominal wall or the heart sac.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis is typically based on history and clinical findings when the veterinarian examines the cow. Symptoms of hardware disease vary depending on where the object penetrates. The cow exhibits an arched back, a reluctance to move and a slow, careful gait. The cow may groan when lying down, getting up, defecating and urinating. The heart rate is normal or slightly elevated, and the respiration is shallow and rapid. In dairy cows, there is often a decrease in milk production. Laboratory tests are not always necessary, but increases in fibrinogen and total plasma protein often result from hardware disease and may be diagnosed with a blood sample. Electronic metal detectors can be used, but not all heavy sharp objects will be metal and it does not distinguish between penetrating and nonpenetrating bodies. Radiographs are also used and are advantageous because the location of the metallic body can be identified. However, if the sharp object is not metallic or dense enough the radiograph is of no use. If there is inflammation in either the Peritoneal cavity or the Pericardium, it can be detected using an ultrasonograph.  Treatment  If hardware disease is suspected, a magnet should be administered orally through a tube into the reticulum. Depending on the type of magnet used, inserting a second magnet could cause internal pinching which could lead to serious complications. A broad-spectrum antibiotic should also be given to control infection. The cow should be confined and movement limited in the hopes that the reticulum can repair the hole. Surgery is necessary in some cases and involves rumenotomy with a physical removal of the object. In some advanced cases that don‚Äôt respond to medical or surgical therapy, slaughter is often considered from an economic perspective.  Prevention  Good feed management is also important; in smaller operations, some farmers pass metal detectors or magnets over the feed. A cow magnet is a veterinary medical device for the treatment or prevention of hardware disease in cattle. Traditionally, cow magnets were strong Alnico magnets about 1 cm by 8 cm (0.4 by 3.1 inches) in the shape of a smoothed rod, but today they are more commonly several ring-shaped ferrite magnets attached to a stainless-steel or plastic core, in the same shape as the single-piece original. Newer designs to help increase effectiveness include a cage design, in which the magnet holds metal objects inside a protective plastic framework. Even newer designs include a stronger array of rare-earth magnets inside a stainless steel body that resembles the original Alnico design. A rancher or dairy farmer feeds a magnet to each calf at branding time; the magnet settles in the rumen or reticulum and remains there for the life of the animal. The magnet is administered after fasting the cow for 18‚Äì24 hours. This is most effective if done to the entire herd before the age of one. The cow magnet attracts such objects and prevents them from becoming lodged in the animal's tissue. While the resultant mass of iron remains in the cow's rumen as a pseudobezoar (an intentionally introduced bezoar), it does not cause the severe problems of hardware disease. Cow magnets cannot be passed through a cow's 4th bonivial meta-colon. Cow magnets are widely available from veterinary, feed supply, and scientific supply sources.

In 2007 the city council of Rosario awarded her the title of Illustrious Citizen. In the English-speaking world Gorodischer might be best known for Kalpa Imperial (In Argentina volume 1 appeared in 1983 and both volumes by 1984). Its English translation came in 2003 by United States speculative fiction author Ursula K. Le Guin. A collection of short stories, it details the history of a vast imaginary empire through tales of fantasy, fable, and allegory. It does this in a way that gained in many admirers who deem it to be one of the finest genre work of Argentina. It also gained supporters in the English-speaking world. A part of the work appeared as a story in the American anthology Starlight 2. \\"Stories Among the Ruins: Angelica Gorodischer's Kalpa Imperial\\" by John Garrison, January 19, 2004, Strange Horizons She also produced many works before Kalpa Imperial including the collections Opus dos [Opus two, 1967], Bajo las jubeas en flor [Under the Flowering Jubeas, 1973], and Casta Luna Electronica [Chaste Electric Moon, 1977]. She was a science fiction author noted for her work about the differences of power among men and women. She focused on the pros and cons of people in power and wrote about corrupt rulers. Gorodischer is author of two novels within the genre of detective fiction. Her detective persona is a female grand dame who reluctantly and haphazardly engages in the world of international intrigue. She made her literary debut in 1985 in Gorodischer's short fictional tale or noveleta entitled Floreros de alabastro, alfombras de Bokhara, reappearing later in different form in Jugo de mango (1988).Garcia Chichester, Ana. \\"Representing the Female Sleuth: Logic and Femininity in Ang√©lica Gorodischer's Floreros de alabastro, alfombras de Bokhara.\\" In Identity, Nation and Discourse: Latin American Women Writers and Artists.

The parties may engage in sexual activity. The generally recognized basis for permitting such visits in modern times is to preserve family bonds and increase the chances of success for a prisoner's eventual return to ordinary life after release from prison. They also provide an incentive to inmates to comply with the various day-to-day rules and regulations of the prison. Conjugal visits usually take place in designated rooms or a structure provided for that purpose, such as a trailer or a small cabin. Supplies such as soap, condoms, lubricant, bed linens, and towels may be provided. Country =Australia= In Australia, conjugal visits are permitted in the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. Other jurisdictions, including Western Australia and Queensland, do not permit conjugal visits. =Japan= In Japan, conjugal visits are not allowed. =Brazil= In Brazil, male prisoners are eligible to be granted conjugal visits for both heterosexual and homosexual relationships, while women's conjugal visits are tightly regulated, if granted at all. =Canada= In Canada, all inmates, with the exception of those on disciplinary restrictions or at risk for family violence, are permitted \\"private family visits\\" of up to 72 hours' duration once every two months. Eligible visitors, who may not themselves be prison inmates, are: spouse, or common-law partner of at least six months; children; parents; foster parents; siblings; grandparents; and \\"persons with whom, in the opinion of the institutional head, the inmate has a close familial bond\\". Food is provided by the institution but paid for by the inmates and visitors, who are also responsible for cleaning the unit after the visit. During a visit, staff members have regular contact with the inmate and visitors. =Czech Republic= In the Czech Republic, a prison warden has the authority to allow an inmate \\"a visit without visual and auditory supervision of the employees of the Prison Service\\". Inmate's medical check is required before such visit is permitted. =Denmark= In Denmark, conjugal visits are permissible. The State Prison of East Jutland has apartments for couples, where inmates who have been sentenced to more than 8 years in prison can have visitation for 47 hours per visit. =France= In France, inmates are permitted conjugal visits. Visits last up to 72 hours and take place in mini- apartments consisting of two small rooms, a kitchen and a dining area. =Germany= Germany allows prisoners and their spouses or partners to apply for conjugal visits. Those who are approved are allowed unsupervised visits so that prisoners can preserve intimate bonds with their partners. However, prisoners are searched before being allowed a visit. In 2010, an inmate murdered his girlfriend and attempted suicide during a visit, leading to additional criticism of the allegedly lax security in German prisons. =Hong Kong= Hong Kong does not permit conjugal visits. =India= In 2015, the Punjab and Haryana High Court held that the right of married convicts and jail inmates to have conjugal visits or artificial insemination for pregnancy was a fundamental right. =Ireland= Ireland does not allow conjugal visits. Marie and Noel Murray, an anarchist married couple imprisoned for a 1976 murder, lost a 1991 appeal for conjugal rights. The Supreme Court ruled that the Constitutional right to beget children within marriage was suspended while a spouse was lawfully imprisoned. =Israel= The Israel Prison Service (IPS) allows standard conjugal visits to inmates who are married or are in a common- law relationship or if their partner has been visiting them frequently for at least two years, and have a record of good behavior. Inmates who receive prison furloughs are not eligible for conjugal visits. Conjugal visits can be withheld on security grounds or as a means of punishment for misbehavior. IPS guidelines were clarified in July 2013 to allow conjugal visits of same-sex partners. =Mexico= Conjugal visits are a universal practice in Mexico, independent of a prisoner's marital status; in some correctional facilities entire families are allowed to live in prisons with their imprisoned relative for extended periods. Specifically in Mexico City, in July 2007, the prison system in that city has begun to allow gay prisoners to have conjugal visits from their partners, on the basis of a 2003 law which bans discrimination based on sexual orientation. =Netherlands= Per December 2015, The Netherlands allows for one conjugal visit ('Bezoek zonder Toezicht' - 'Unsupervised Visit') per month, provided the imprisonment period is at least six months and there's a close and durable relation between the partners. This does not apply to maximum security penitentiaries. =New Zealand= New Zealand does not permit conjugal visits. =Pakistan= In Pakistan, conjugal visits prior to 2009 were permitted only under special circumstances. In August 2009, Federal Shariat Court ruled that married prisoners should be allowed conjugal visits at the designated facilities within the jail complex and alternatively, they should be granted a short parole to visit their spouses. Following the ruling, the Province of Sindh was the first to adopt legislation providing conjugal visits for married prisoners within Jail premises. Human Rights Book 2010 reports that Conjugal visits are now available for Prisoners in all Provinces and Federal territories if they are male and married. Since homosexuality is considered a criminal offense in Pakistan and same-sex marriage is not recognized by law, this privilege applies only to heterosexual couples. =Russia= In the Russian penal system, since a campaign of prison reform that began in 2001, well-behaved prisoners are granted an eighteen-day holiday furlough from incarceration to see loved ones. Prisoners also get extended on-site family visits, approximately once per month. =Spain= In Spain, prisoners are allowed conjugal visits every four to eight weeks. They are held in private rooms and can last up to three hours. Couples are provided with condoms, shower facilities, and clean towels. = Turkey = Since April 2013, the Turkish General Directorate of Prisons and Detention offers conjugal visits as a reward to well-behaved prisoners. =United Kingdom= The English, Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish prison systems do not allow conjugal visits. However, home visits, with a greater emphasis on building other links with the outside world to which the prisoner will be returned, are allowed. These home visits are usually only granted to prisoners who have a few weeks to a few months remaining of a long sentence. Furthermore, home visits are more likely to be granted if the prisoner is deemed to have a low risk of absconding (i.e. prisoners being held in open prisons have a better chance of being granted home visits than prisoners being held in closed conditions). =United States = In Lyons v. Gilligan (1974), the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio held that prisoners have no federal constitutional right to conjugal visits with their spouses during sentences. The United States Federal Bureau of Prisons does not allow conjugal visits for prisoners in federal custody. For prisoners in state custody, the availability of conjugal visits is governed by the law of the particular state. Where conjugal visits are allowed, inmates must meet certain requirements to qualify for this privilege: The visitor may be required to undergo a background check, and the inmate must also be free of any sexually transmitted diseases. As a matter of procedure, both visitor and inmate are searched before and after the visit, to ensure that the visitor has not attempted to smuggle any items into or out of the facility. The first state to implement conjugal visits was Mississippi in the Mississippi State Penitentiary (Parchman). It was enacted to convince black male prisoners to work harder in their manual labor. Jorja Leap, a professor of social welfare at the Luskin School of Public Affairs at the University of California, Los Angeles stated that criminologists believe allowing conjugal visits would build family ties and reduce recidivism. Over the last 40 years, most new prisons included special buildings specifically designed for \\"Sunday visits.\\" By the early 1990s, 17 states had conjugal programs. According to Leap, conjugal visits declined after an increase in attitudes that prison should be a place for punishment and that conjugal visits were not appropriate for people being punished, and also because academic literature in the 1980s and 1990s argued that it was not possible to rehabilitate some criminals. In June 2007, the California Department of Corrections announced it would allow same-sex conjugal visits. The policy was enacted to comply with a 2005 state law requiring state agencies to give the same rights to domestic partners that heterosexual couples receive. The new rules allow for visits only by registered married same sex couples or domestic partners who are not themselves incarcerated. Further, the same-sex marriage or domestic partnership must have been established before the prisoner was incarcerated. As of 2008, conjugal visitation programs are now known as the extended-family visits or family-reunion visits because mothers, fathers, and other family members may attend these visits. The focus is on family ties and rehabilitation. In April 2011, New York adopted legislation to allow family visits for married partners. In January 2014, the head of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, Chris Epps, terminated the state conjugal program. New Mexico announced it was also ending its program in May 2014. The four states that currently allow conjugal visits are California, Connecticut, New York, and Washington.

It grows to a height of and has phyllodes (flattened leaf stalks) instead of true leaves. Sickle-shaped, these are between long, and wide. The profuse fragrant, golden flowers appear in late winter and spring, followed by long seed pods. Plants are cross- pollinated by several species of honeyeater and thornbill, which visit nectaries on the phyllodes and brush against flowers, transferring pollen between them. An understorey plant in eucalyptus forest, it is found from southern New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, through Victoria and into southeastern South Australia. Explorer Thomas Mitchell collected the type specimen, from which George Bentham wrote the species description in 1842. No subspecies are recognised. The bark of A. pycnantha produces more tannin than any other wattle species, resulting in its commercial cultivation for production of this compound. It has been widely grown as an ornamental garden plant and for cut flower production, but has become a weed in South Africa, Tanzania, Italy, Portugal, Sardinia, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, as well as Western Australia, Tasmania and New South Wales. Acacia pycnantha was made the official floral emblem of Australia in 1988, and has been featured on the country's postal stamps. Description Habit, Geelong Botanic Gardensalt=A rounded tree with green foliage and profuse yellow flowers in a public garden Acacia pycnantha generally grows as a small tree to between in height, though trees of up to high have been reported in Morocco. The bark is generally dark brown to grey‚Äîsmooth in younger plants though it can be furrowed and rough in older plants. Branchlets may be bare and smooth or covered with a white bloom. The mature trees do not have true leaves but have phyllodes‚Äîflat and widened leaf stems‚Äîthat hang down from the branches. Shiny and dark green, these are between long, wide and falcate (sickle-shaped) to oblanceolate in shape. New growth has a bronze colouration. Field observations at Hale Conservation Park show the bulk of new growth to take place over spring and summer from October to January. Floral buds are produced year-round on the tips of new growth, but only those initiated between November and May go on to flower several months later. Flowering usually takes place from July to November (late winter to early summer) in the golden wattle's native range; because the later buds develop faster, flowering peaks over July and August. The bright yellow inflorescences occur in groups of 40 to 80 on -long racemes that arise from axillary buds. Each inflorescence is a ball-like structure that is covered by 40 to 100 small flowers that have five tiny petals (pentamerous) and long erect stamens, which give the flower head a fluffy appearance. Developing after flowering has finished, the seed pods are flattish, straight or slightly curved, long and 5‚Äì8 mm wide. They are initially bright green, maturing to dark brown and have slight constrictions between the seeds, which are arranged in a line in the pod. The oblong seeds themselves are 5.5 to 6 mm long, black and shiny, with a clavate (club-shaped) aril. They are released in December and January, when the pods are fully ripe. Species similar in appearance include mountain hickory wattle (A. obliquinervia), coast golden wattle (A. leiophylla) and golden wreath wattle (A. saligna). Acacia obliquinervia has grey-green phyllodes, fewer flowers in its flower heads, and broader (-wide) seed pods. A. leiophylla has paler phyllodes. A. saligna has longer, narrower phyllodes. Taxonomy Acacia pycnantha was first formally described by botanist George Bentham in the London Journal of Botany in 1842. The type specimen was collected by the explorer Thomas Mitchell in present-day northern Victoria between Pyramid Hill and the Loddon River. Bentham thought it was related to A. leiophylla, which he described in the same paper. The specific epithet pycnantha is derived from the Greek words pyknos (dense) and anthos (flower), a reference to the dense cluster of flowers that make up the globular inflorescences. Queensland botanist Les Pedley reclassified the species as Racosperma pycnanthum in 2003, when he proposed placing almost all Australian members of the genus into the new genus Racosperma. However, this name is treated as a synonym of its original name. Johann Georg Christian Lehmann described Acacia petiolaris in 1851 from a plant grown at Hamburg Botanic Gardens from seed said to be from the Swan River Colony (Perth). Carl Meissner described A. falcinella from material from Port Lincoln in 1855. Bentham classified both as A. pycnantha in his 1864 Flora Australiensis, though he did categorise a possible subspecies angustifolia based on material from Spencer Gulf with narrower phyllodes and fewer inflorescences. However, no subspecies are currently recognised, though an informal classification distinguishes wetland and dryland forms, the latter with narrower phyllodes. In 1921 Joseph Maiden described Acacia westonii from the northern and western slopes of Mount Jerrabomberra near Queanbeyan in New South Wales. He felt it was similar to, but distinct from, A. pycnantha and was uncertain whether it warranted species rank. His colleague Richard Hind Cambage grew seedlings and reported they had much longer internodes than those of A. pycnantha, and that the phyllodes appeared to have three nectaries rather than the single one of the latter species. It is now regarded as a synonym of A. pycnantha. Common names recorded include golden wattle, green wattle, black wattle, and broad-leaved wattle. At Ebenezer Mission in the Wergaia country of north-western Victoria the aborigines referred to it as witch. Hybrids of the species are known in nature and cultivation. In the Whipstick forest near Bendigo in Victoria, putative hybrids with Whirrakee wattle (Acacia williamsonii) have been identified; these resemble hakea wattle (Acacia hakeoides). Garden hybrids with Queensland silver wattle (Acacia podalyriifolia) raised in Europe have been given the names Acacia x siebertiana and Acacia x deneufvillei. Distribution and habitat Galls formed by alt=Round green ball-like galls among green phyllodes (leaves) Golden wattle occurs in south-eastern Australia from South Australia's southern Eyre Peninsula and Flinders Ranges across Victoria and northwards into inland areas of southern New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. It is found in the understorey of open eucalypt forests on dry, shallow soils. The species has become naturalised beyond its original range in Australia. In New South Wales it is especially prevalent around Sydney and the Central Coast region. In Tasmania it has spread in the east of the state and become weedy in bushland near Hobart. In Western Australia, it is found in the Darling Range and western wheatbelt as well as Esperance and Kalgoorlie. Outside Australia it has become naturalised in South Africa, Tanzania, Italy, Portugal, Sardinia, India, Indonesia and New Zealand. It is present in California as a garden escapee, but is not considered to be naturalised there. In South Africa, where it had been introduced between 1858 and 1865 for dune stabilization and tannin production, it had spread along waterways into forest, mountain and lowland fynbos, and borderline areas between fynbos and karoo. The gall-forming wasp Trichilogaster signiventris has been introduced in South Africa for biological control and has reduced the capacity of trees to reproduce throughout their range. The eggs are laid by adult wasps into buds of flower heads in the summer, before hatching in May and June when the larvae induce the formation of the grape-like galls and prevent flower development. The galls can be so heavy that branches break under their weight. In addition, the introduction in 2001 of the acacia seed weevil Melanterius compactus has also proved effective. Ecology alt=a fly perched on a phyllode Though plants are usually killed by a severe fire, mature specimens are able to resprout. Seeds are able to persist in the soil for more than five years, germinating after fire. Like other wattles, Acacia pycnantha fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere. It hosts bacteria known as rhizobia that form root nodules, where they make nitrogen available in organic form and thus help the plant grow in poor soils. A field study across Australia and South Africa found that the microbes are genetically diverse, belonging to various strains of the species Bradyrhizobium japonicum and genus Burkholderia in both countries. It is unclear whether the golden wattle was accompanied by the bacteria to the African continent or encountered new populations there. Self-incompatible, Acacia pycnantha cannot fertilise itself and requires cross-pollination between plants to set seed. Birds facilitate this and field experiments keeping birds away from flowers greatly reduces seed production. Nectaries are located on phyllodes; those near open flowers become active, producing nectar that birds feed upon just before or during flowering. While feeding, birds brush against the flower heads and dislodge pollen and often visit multiple trees. Several species of honeyeater, including the white-naped, yellow-faced, New Holland, and occasionally white- plumed and crescent honeyeaters, and Eastern spinebills have been observed foraging. Other bird species include the silvereye, striated, buff-rumped and brown thornbills. As well as eating nectar, birds often pick off insects on the foliage. Honeybees, native bees, ants and flies also visit nectaries, but generally do not come into contact with the flowers during this activity. The presence of Acacia pycnantha is positively correlated with numbers of swift parrots overwintering in box‚Äìironbark forest in central Victoria, though it is not clear whether the parrots are feeding on them or some other factor is at play. The wood serves as food for larvae of the jewel beetle species Agrilus assimilis, A. australasiae and A. hypoleucus. The larvae of a number of butterfly species feed on the foliage including the fiery jewel, icilius blue, lithocroa blue and wattle blue. Trichilogaster wasps form galls in the flowerheads, disrupting seed set and Acizzia acaciaepycnanthae, a psyllid, sucks sap from the leaves. Acacia pycnantha is a host to rust fungus species in the genus Uromycladium that affect the phyllodes and branches. These include Uromycladium simplex that forms pustules and U. tepperianum that causes large swollen brown to black galls that eventually lead to the death of the host plant. Two fungal species have been isolated from leaf spots on Acacia pycnantha: Seimatosporium arbuti, which is found on a wide range of plant hosts, and Monochaetia lutea. Uses alt=closeup of trunk and bark with single point showing oozing transparent golden gum-like substance Golden wattle has been grown in temperate regions around the world for the tannin in its bark, as it provides the highest yield of all wattles. Trees can be harvested for tannin from seven to ten years of age. Commercial use of its timber is limited by the small size of trees, but it has high value as a fuel wood. The scented flowers have been used for perfume making, and honey production in humid areas. However, the pollen is too dry to be collected by bees in dry climates. In southern Europe, it is one of several species grown for the cut-flower trade and sold as \\"mimosa\\". Like many other species of wattle, Acacia pycnantha exudes gum when stressed. Eaten by indigenous Australians, the gum has been investigated as a possible alternative to gum arabic, commonly used in the food industry. Cultivation Golden wattle is cultivated in Australia and was introduced to the northern hemisphere in the mid-1800s. Although it has a relatively short lifespan of 15 to 30 years, it is widely grown for its bright yellow, fragrant flowers. As well as being an ornamental plant, it has been used as a windbreak or in controlling erosion. Trees are sometimes planted with the taller sugar gum (Eucalyptus cladocalyx) to make a two-layered windbreak. One form widely cultivated was originally collected on Mount Arapiles in western Victoria. It is floriferous, with fragrant flowers appearing from April to July. The species has a degree of frost tolerance and is adaptable to a wide range of soil conditions, but it prefers good drainage. It tolerates heavy soils in dry climates, as well as mild soil salinity. It can suffer yellowing (chlorosis) in limestone-based (alkaline) soils. Highly drought-tolerant, it needs winter rainfall for cultivation. It is vulnerable to gall attack in cultivation. Propagation is from seed which has been pre-soaked in hot water to soften the hard seed coating. Symbolic and cultural references alt=Green leaves and numerous small yellow round flowerheads against the sky Although wattles, and in particular the golden wattle, have been the informal floral emblem of Australia for many years (for instance, it represented Australia on the Coronation gown of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953), it was not until Australia's bicentenary in 1988 that the golden wattle was formally adopted as the floral emblem of Australia. This was proclaimed by Governor-General Sir Ninian Stephen in the Government gazette published on 1 September. The day was marked by a ceremony at the Australian National Botanic Gardens which included the planting of a golden wattle by Hazel Hawke, the Prime Minister's wife. In 1992, 1 September was formally declared \\"National Wattle Day\\". The Australian Coat of Arms includes a wreath of wattle; this does not, however, accurately represent a golden wattle. Similarly, the green and gold colours used by Australian international sporting teams were inspired by the colours of wattles in general, rather than the golden wattle specifically. The species was depicted on a stamp captioned \\"wattle\\" as part of a 1959‚Äì60 Australian stamp set featuring Australian native flowers. In 1970, a 5c stamp labelled \\"Golden Wattle\\" was issued to complement an earlier set depicting the floral emblems of Australia. To mark Australia Day in 1990, a 41c stamp labelled \\"Acacia pycnantha\\" was issued. Another stamp labelled \\"Golden Wattle\\", with a value of 70c, was issued in 2014. Clare Waight Keller included golden wattles to represent Australia in Meghan Markle's wedding veil, which included the distinctive flora of each Commonwealth country. The 1970 Monty Python's Flying Circus Bruces sketch includes a reference, by one of the stereotyped Australian characters, to \\"the wattle\\" as being \\"the emblem of our land\\", with suggested methods of display including \\"stick[ing] it in a bottle or hold[ing] it in your hand\\" - despite the wattle prop itself being a large, forked branch with sparse patches of leaves and generic yellow flowers.

S. MacLeay in 1839. They are commonly called antmimicking spiders, but they are not the only spiders that have this attribute. The name is a combination of Ancient Greek (myrmex), meaning \\"ant\\", and (arachne), meaning \\"spider\\". This genus has undergone many changes, and is still under review as more information becomes available. In 2016, several genera were split off, including Helicius and the monotypic genus Panachraesta. The genus Emertonius was revalidated in 2018 after being synonymized with Myrmarachne for nearly thirty years. Description Myrmarachne have an elongated cephalothorax with relatively long chelicerae that projects forward in males. The cephalothorax has a waist, and the opisthosoma often has one too. The colors can vary from black to yellow, depending on ant species it is mimicking, and can change over the course of its life. For example, one African species was observed to mimic a certain species of ants as a juvenile, and another ant species as an adult. They tend to wave their front legs in the air to simulate antennae, and many have bodies that also closely resemble ants. The genus Bocus is so similar to Myrmarachne that it cannot be distinguished without the help of a microscope. Species With about 80 described and many undescribed southeast Asian species, Myrmarachne is the most diverse genus of jumping spider in this region. A few species, such as the palearctic M. formicaria, occur in temperate regions. it contains 185 species and three subspecies found in the tropics from Africa to Australia, with some species found in the New World: References Further reading * Category:Salticidae Category:Salticidae genera Category:Cosmopolitan spiders ","title":"Myrmarachne"},{"id":"2199064","text":"Makeup sex is an informal term for sexual intercourse which may be experienced after conflict in an intimate personal relationship. These conflicts may range from minor arguments to relationship breakups. Sex under these circumstances may be more gratifying and invested with additional emotional significance. It is sometimes conceived as a physical expression of reconciliation and rediscovery of one's partner following the cathartic experience of a fight and may resolve underlying conflicts. Makeup sex has been attributed to increased sexual desires stemming from romantic conflict. After conflict during a relationship, arousal transfer may occur which shifts anger into arousal. Experts disagree on the outlook of makeup sex, some believe makeup sex is unhealthy as it rewards \\"fighting, drama, and generally bad behavior\\". Sexologist and television personality Jessica O‚ÄôReilly, describes makeup sex as positive, settling conflicts which can only be resolved through sex. Makeup sex may be more intense, as it may assist in releasing underlying emotions. Breakup sex While makeup sex often seen as a form of reconciliation, breakup sex has been described as \\"more like one last 'hurrah' before you part ways\\".

Paraceratherium means \\"near the hornless beast\\", in reference to Aceratherium, the genus in which the type species A. bugtiense was originally placed. The exact size of Paraceratherium is unknown because of the incompleteness of the fossils. The shoulder height was about , and the length about . Its weight is estimated to have been about . The long neck supported a skull that was about long. It had large, tusk-like incisors and a nasal incision that suggests it had a prehensile upper lip or proboscis (trunk). The legs were long and pillar-like. The lifestyle of Paraceratherium may have been similar to that of modern large mammals such as the elephants and extant rhinoceroses. Because of its size, it would have had few predators and a slow rate of reproduction. It was a browser, eating mainly leaves, soft plants, and shrubs. It lived in habitats ranging from arid deserts with a few scattered trees to subtropical forests. The reasons for the animal's extinction are unknown, but various factors have been proposed. The taxonomy of the genus and the species within has a long and complicated history. Other genera of Oligocene indricotheres, such as Baluchitherium, Indricotherium, and Pristinotherium, have been named, but no complete specimens exist, making comparison and classification difficult. Most modern scientists consider these genera to be junior synonyms of Paraceratherium, and it is thought to contain at least three discernible species; P. bugtiense, P. transouralicum, and P. huangheense. The most completely-known species is P. transouralicum, so most reconstructions of the genus are based on it. Differences between P. bugtiense and P. transouralicum may be due to sexual dimorphism, which would make them the same species. Taxonomy 1911 illustration of the down-turned lower jaw of P. bugtiense, which was the basis for its separation from the genus Aceratherium The taxonomic history of Paraceratherium is complex due to the fragmentary nature of the known fossils and because Western, Soviet, and Chinese scientists worked in isolation from each other for much of the 20th century and published research mainly in their respective languages. Scientists from different parts of the world tried to compare their finds to get a more complete picture of these animals, but were hindered by politics and wars. The opposing taxonomic tendencies of \\"lumping and splitting\\" have also contributed to the problem. Inaccurate geological dating previously led scientists to believe various geological formations that are now known to be contemporaneous were of different ages. Many genera were named on the basis of subtle differences in molar tooth characteristicsfeatures that vary within populations of other rhinoceros taxaand are therefore not accepted by most scientists for distinguishing species. Early discoveries of indricotheres were made through various colonial links to Asia. The first known indricothere fossils were collected from Balochistan (in modern-day Pakistan) in 1846 by a soldier named Vickary, but these fragments were unidentifiable at the time.Prothero, 2013. pp. 35‚Äì52 The first fossils now recognised as Paraceratherium were discovered by the British geologist Guy Ellcock Pilgrim in Balochistan in 1907‚Äì1908. His material consisted of an upper jaw, lower teeth, and the back of a jaw. The fossils were collected in the Chitarwata Formation of Dera Bugti, where Pilgrim had previously been exploring. In 1908, he used the fossils as basis for a new species of the extinct rhinoceros genus Aceratherium; A. bugtiense. Aceratherium was by then a wastebasket taxon; it included several unrelated species of hornless rhinoceros, many of which have since been moved to other genera.Prothero, 2013. pp. 17‚Äì34 Fossil incisors that Pilgrim had previously assigned to the unrelated genus Bugtitherium were later shown to belong to the new species. 1913 illustration of an astragalus bone, foot bone, atlas bone, and various vertebrae, which were part of the basis for Baluchitherium osborni, now a synonym of P. bugtiense In 1910, more partial fossils were discovered in Dera Bugti during an expedition by the British palaeontologist Clive Forster-Cooper. Based on these remains, Foster-Cooper moved A. bugtiense to the new genus Paraceratherium, meaning \\"near the hornless beast\\", in reference to Aceratherium. His rationale for this reclassification was the species' distinctly down-turned lower tusks. In 1913, Forster-Cooper named a new genus and species, Thaumastotherium (\\"wonderful beast\\") osborni, based on larger fossils from the same excavations (some of which he had earlier suggested to belong to male P. bugtiense), but he renamed the genus Baluchitherium later that year because the former name was preoccupied, as it had already been used for a hemipteran insect. The fossils of Baluchitherium were so fragmentary that Foster-Cooper was only able to identify it as a kind of odd-toed ungulate, but he mentioned the possibility of confusion with Paraceratherium. The American palaeontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn, after which B. osborni was named, suggested it may have been a titanothere. A Russian Academy of Sciences expedition later found fossils in the Aral Formation near the Aral Sea in Kazakhstan; it was the most complete indricothere skeleton known, but it lacked the skull. In 1916, based on these remains, Aleksei Alekseeivich Borissiak erected the genus Indricotherium named for a mythological monster, the \\"Indrik beast\\". He did not assign a species name, I. asiaticum, until 1923, but the Russian palaeontologist Maria Pavlova had already named it I. transouralicum in 1922. Also in 1923, Borissiak created the subfamily Indricotheriinae to include the various related forms known by then. In 1922, the American explorer Roy Chapman Andrews led a well- documented expedition to China and Mongolia sponsored by the American Museum of Natural History. Various indricothere remains were found in formations of the Mongolian Gobi Desert, including the legs of a specimen standing in an upright position, indicating that it had died while trapped in quicksand, as well as a very complete skull. These remains became the basis of Baluchitherium grangeri, named by Osborn in 1923.Prothero, 2013. pp. 1‚Äì16 In 2017, a new species, P. huangheense, was named by the Chinese palaeontologist Yong-Xiang Li and colleagues based on jaw elements from the Hanjiajing Formation in the Gansu Province of China; the name refers to the nearby Huanghe River. A multitude of other species and genus namesmostly based on differences in size, snout shape, and front tooth arrangementhave been coined for various indricothere remains. Fossils attributable to Paraceratherium continue to be discovered across Eurasia, but the political situation in Pakistan has become too unstable for further excavations to occur there. =Species and synonyms= Preparator with P. transouralicum skull (AMNH 18650), formerly assigned to B. grangeri, American Museum of Natural History In 1922 Forster-Cooper named the new species Metamynodon bugtiensis based on a palate and other fragments from Dera Bugti, thought to belong to a giant member of that genus. These fossils are now thought to have belonged to an aberrant Paraceratherium bugtiense specimen that lacked the M3 molar. In 1936, the American palaeontologists Walter Granger and William K. Gregory proposed that Forster-Cooper's Baluchitherium osborni was likely a junior synonym (an invalid name for the same taxon) of Paraceratherium bugtiense, because these specimens were collected at the same locality and were possibly part of the same morphologically variable species. The American palaeontologist William Diller Matthew and Forster-Cooper himself had expressed similar doubts few years earlier. Although it had already been declared a junior synonym, the genus name Baluchitherium remained popular in various media because of the publicity surrounding Osborn's B. grangeri.Prothero, 2013. pp. 67‚Äì86 1911 illustration of a P. bugtiense incisor and part of a mandible In 1989, the American palaeontologists Spencer G. Lucas and Jay C. Sobus published a revision of indricothere taxa, which is followed by most western scientists today. They concluded that Paraceratherium, as the oldest name, was the only valid indricothere genus from the Oligocene, and contained four valid species, P. bugtiense, P. transouralicum (originally in Indricotherium), P. prohorovi (originally in Aralotherium), and P. orgosensis (originally in Dzungariotherium). They considered most other names to be junior synonyms of those taxa, or as dubious names, based on remains too fragmentary to identify properly. By analysing alleged differences between named genera and species, Lucas and Sobus found that these most likely represented variation within populations, and that most features were indistinguishable between specimens, as had been pointed out in the 1930s. The fact that the single skull assigned to P. transouralicum or Indricotherium was domed, while others were flat at the top was attributed to sexual dimorphism; it is possible that P. bugtiense fossils represent the female, while P. transouralicum represents the male of the same species. According to Lucas and Sobus, the type species P. bugtiense from the late Oligocene of Pakistan includes junior synonyms such as B. osborni and P. zhajremensis. P. transouralicum from the late Oligocene of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and northern China includes B. grangeri and I. minus. In 2013, the American palaeontologist Donald Prothero suggested that P. orgosensis may be distinct enough to warrant its original genus name Dzungariotherium, though its exact position requires evaluation. P. prohorovi from the late Oligocene of Kazakhstan may be too incomplete for its position to be resolved in relation to the other species; the same applies to proposed species such as I. intermedium and P. tienshanensis, as well as the genus Benaratherium. Though the genus name Indricotherium is now a junior synonym of Paraceratherium, the subfamily name Indricotheriinae is still in use because genus name synonymy does not affect the names of higher level taxa that are derived from these. Members of the subfamily are therefore still commonly referred to as indricotheres. In contrast to the revision by Lucas and Sobus, a 2003 paper by Chinese palaeontologist Jie Ye and colleagues suggested that Indricotherium and Dzungariotherium were valid genera, and that P. prohorovi did not belong in Paraceratherium. They also recognised the validity of species such as P. lipidus, P. tienshanensis, and P. sui. A 2004 paper by Chinese palaeontologist Tao Deng and colleagues also recognised three distinct genera. Some western writers have similarly used names otherwise considered invalid since the 1989 revision, but without providing detailed analysis and justification. =Evolution= Comparison of the front teeth of Metamynodon (Amynodontidae), Hyracodon (Hyracodontidae), Paraceratherium (Indricotheriinae), and Trigonias (Rhinocerotidae) The superfamily Rhinocerotoidea, which includes modern rhinoceroses, can be traced back to the early Eoceneabout 50 million years agowith early precursors such as Hyrachyus. Rhinocerotoidea contains three families; Amynodontidae, Rhinocerotidae (\\"true rhinoceroses\\"), and Hyracodontidae. The diversity within the rhinoceros group was much larger in prehistoric times; they ranged from dog-sized to the size of Paraceratherium. There were long-legged, cursorial forms adapted for running and squat, semi aquatic forms. Most species did not have horns. Rhinoceros fossils are identified as such mainly by characteristics of their teeth, which is the part of the animals most likely to be preserved. The upper molars of most rhinoceroses have a pi-shaped (œÄ) pattern on the crown, and each lower molar has paired L-shapes. Various skull features are also used for identification of fossil rhinoceroses. The subfamily Indricotheriinae, to which Paraceratherium belongs, was first classified as part of the family Hyracodontidae by the American palaeontologist Leonard B. Radinsky in 1966. Previously, they had been regarded as a subfamily within Rhinocerotidea, or even a full family, Indricotheriidae. In a 1999 cladistic study of tapiromorphs, the American palaeontologist Luke Holbrook found indricotheres to be outside the hyracodontid clade, and wrote that they may not be a monophyletic (natural) grouping. Radinsky's scheme is the prevalent hypothesis today. The hyracodont family contains long-legged members adapted to running, such as Hyracodon, and were distinguished by incisor characteristics. Indricotheres are distinguished from other hyracodonts by their larger size and the derived structure of their snouts, incisors and canines. The earliest known indricothere is the dog-sized Forstercooperia from the middle and late Eocene of western North America and Asia. The cow-sized Juxia is known from the middle Eocene; by the late Eocene the genus Urtinotherium of Asia had almost reached the size of Paraceratherium.Prothero, 2013. pp. 53‚Äì66 Paraceratherium itself lived in Eurasia during the Oligocene period, 23 to 34 million years ago. The genus is distinguished from other indricotheres by its large size, nasal incision that would have supported a muscular snout, and its down-turned premaxillae. It had also lost the second and third lower incisors, lower canines, and lower first premolars. Skull and neck of Juxia, a cow sized relative from the middle Eocene, Palaeozoological Museum of China The cladogram below follows the 1989 analysis of Indricotheriinae by Lucas and Sobus, and shows the closest relatives of Paraceratherium: Lucas and colleagues had reached similar conclusions in a previous 1981 analysis of Forstercooperia, wherein they still retained Paraceratherium and Indricotherium as separate genera. In 2016, the Chinese researchers Haibing Wang and colleagues used the name Paraceratheriidae for the family and paraceratheriine for the subfamily, and placed them outside of Hyracodontidae. Description Estimated size of P. transouralicum (olive green) compared with that of humans, other large mammals, and the dinosaur Patagotitan Paraceratherium is one of the largest known land mammals that have ever existed, but its precise size is unclear because of the lack of complete specimens. Its total body length was estimated as from front to back by Granger and Gregory in 1936, and by the Soviet palaeontologist Vera Gromova in 1959, but the former estimate is now considered exaggerated. The weight of Paraceratherium was similar to that of some extinct proboscideans, with the largest complete skeleton known belonging to the steppe mammoth (Mammuthus trogontherii). Despite its roughly equivalent mass, Paraceratherium might have been taller than any proboscidean. Its shoulder height was estimated as at the shoulders by Granger and Gregory, but by the American palaeontologist Gregory S. Paul in 1997. The neck was estimated at long by the palaeontologists Michael P. Taylor and Mathew J. Wedel in 2013. Life restoration of P. transouralicum Early estimates of are now considered exaggerated; it may have been in the range of at maximum, and as low as on average. Calculations have mainly been based on fossils of P. transouralicum because this species is known from the most complete remains. Estimates have been based on skull, teeth, and limb bone measurements, but the known bone elements are represented by individuals of different sizes, so all skeletal reconstructions are composite extrapolations, resulting in several weight ranges. There are no indications of the colour and skin texture of the animal because no skin impressions or mummies are known. Most life restorations show the creature's skin as thick, folded, grey, and hairless, based on modern rhinoceroses. Because hair retains body heat, modern large mammals such as elephants and rhinoceroses are largely hairless. Prothero has proposed that, contrary to most depictions, Paraceratherium had large elephant-like ears that it used for thermoregulation. The ears of elephants enlarge the body's surface area and are filled with blood vessels, making the dissipation of excess heat easier. According to Prothero, this would have been true for Paraceratherium, as indicated by the robust bones around the ear openings.Prothero, 2013. pp. 87‚Äì106 The palaeontologists Pierre-Olivier Antoine and Darren Naish have expressed scepticism towards this idea. =Skull= P. transouralicum skull, AMNH The largest skulls of Paraceratherium are around long, at the back of the skull, and wide across by the zygomatic arches. Paraceratherium had a long forehead, which was smooth and lacked the roughened area that serves as attachment point for the horns of other rhinoceroses. The bones above the nasal region are long and the nasal incision goes far into the skull. This indicates that Paraceratherium had a prehensile upper lip similar to that of the black rhinoceros and the Indian rhinoceros, or a short proboscis (trunk) as in tapirs. The back of the skull was low and narrow, without the large lambdoid crests at the top and along the sagittal crest, which are otherwise found in horned and tusked animals that need strong muscles to push and fight. It also had a deep pit for the attachment of nuchal ligaments, which hold up the skull automatically. The occipital condyle was very wide and Paraceratherium appears to have had large, strong neck muscles, which allowed it to sweep its head strongly downwards while foraging from branches. One skull of P. transouralicum has a domed forehead, whereas others have flat foreheads, possibly because of sexual dimorphism. A brain endocast of P. transouralicum shows it was only 8 percent of the skull length, while the brain of the Indian rhinoceros is 17.7 percent of its skull length. Upper molars of P. transouralicum, Musee d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris The species of Paraceratherium are mainly discernible through skull characteristics. P. bugtiense had features such as relatively slender maxillae and premaxillae, shallow skull roofs, mastoid-paroccipital processes that were relatively thin and placed back on the skull, a lambdoid crest, which extended less back, and an occipital condyle with a horizontal orientation, which it shared with Dzungariotherium. P. transouralicum had robust maxillae and premaxillae, upturned zygomata, domed frontal bones, thick mastoid-paroccipital processes, a lambdoid crest that extended back, and occipital condyles with a vertical orientation. P. huangheense differed from P. bugtiense only in the anatomy of the rear portion of the jaw, as well as its larger size. Unlike those of most primitive rhinoceroses, the front teeth of Paraceratherium were reduced to a single pair of incisors in either jaw, which were large and conical, and have been described as tusks. The upper incisors pointed downwards; the lower ones were shorter and pointed forwards. Among known rhinoceroses, this arrangement is unique to Paraceratherium and the related Urtinotherium. The incisors may have been larger in males. The canine teeth otherwise found behind the incisors were lost. The incisors were separated from the row of cheek teeth by a large diastema (gap). This feature is found in mammals where the incisors and cheek teeth have different specialisations. The upper molars, except for the third upper molar that was V-shaped, had a pi-shaped (œÄ) pattern and a reduced metastyle. The premolars only partially formed the pi pattern. Each molar was the size of a human fist; among mammals they were only exceeded in size by proboscideans, though they were small relative to the size of the skull. The lower cheek teeth were L-shaped, which is typical of rhinoceroses. =Postcranial skeleton= Hind foot of P. transouralicum, AMNH No complete set of vertebrae and ribs of Paraceratherium has yet been found and the tail is completely unknown. The atlas and axis vertebrae of the neck were wider than in most modern rhinoceroses, with space for strong ligaments and muscles that would be needed to hold up the large head. The rest of the vertebrae were also very wide, and had large zygapophyses with much room for muscles, tendons, ligaments, and nerves, to support the head, neck, and spine. The neural spines were long and formed a long \\"hump\\" along the back, where neck muscles and nuchal ligaments for holding up the skull were attached. The ribs were similar to those of modern rhinoceroses, but the ribcage would have looked smaller in proportion to the long legs and large bodies, because modern rhinoceroses are comparatively short-limbed. The last vertebra of the lower back was fused to the sacrum, a feature found in advanced rhinoceroses. Like sauropod dinosaurs, Paraceratherium had pleurocoel-like openings (hollow parts of the bone) in their pre-sacral vertebrae, which probably helped to lighten the skeleton. 1923 skeletal reconstructions of B. grangeri (now P. transouralicum), in rhinoceros-like and slender versions The limbs were large and robust to support the animal's large weight, and were in some ways similar to and convergent with those of elephants and sauropod dinosaurs with their likewise graviportal (heavy and slow moving) builds. Unlike such animals, which tend to lengthen the upper limb bones while shortening, fusing and compressing the lower limb, hand, and foot bones, Paraceratherium had short upper limb bones and long hand and foot bonesexcept for the disc-shaped phalangessimilar to the running rhinoceroses from which they descended. Some foot bones were almost long. The thigh bones typically measured , a size only exceeded by those of some elephants and dinosaurs. The thigh bones were pillar-like and much thicker and more robust than those of other rhinoceroses, and the three trochanters on the sides were much reduced, as this robustness diminished their importance. The limbs were held in a column-like posture instead of bent, as in smaller animals, which reduced the need for large limb muscles. The front limbs had three toes. Due to the fragmentary nature of known Paraceratherium fossils, the skeleton of the animal has been reconstructed in several different ways since its discovery. In 1923, Matthew supervised an artist to draw a reconstruction of the skeleton based on the even less complete P. transouralicum specimens known by then, using the proportions of a modern rhinoceros as a guide. The result was too squat and compact, and Osborn had a more slender version drawn later the same year. Some later life restorations have made the animal too slender, with little regard to the underlying skeleton. Gromova published a more complete skeletal reconstruction in 1959, based on the P. transouralicum skeleton from the Aral Formation, but this also lacked several neck vertebrae. Palaeobiology Foraging herd of P. transouralicum, by Elizabeth Rungius Fulda, 1923 The British zoologist Robert M. Alexander suggested in 1988 that overheating may have been a serious problem in Paraceratherium due to its size. According to Prothero, the best living analogues for Paraceratherium may be large mammals such as elephants, rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses. To aid in thermoregulation, these animals cool down during the day by resting in the shade or by wallowing in water and mud. They also forage and move mainly at night. Because of its large size, Paraceratherium would not have been able to run and move quickly, but they would have been able to cross large distances, which would be necessary in an environment with a scarcity of food. They may therefore have had large home ranges and have been migratory. Prothero suggests that animals as big as indricotheres would need very large home ranges or territories of at least and that, because of a scarcity of resources, there would have been little room in Asia for many populations or a multitude of nearly identical species and genera. This principle is called competitive exclusion; it is used to explain how the black rhinoceros (a browser) and white rhinoceros (a grazer) exploit different niches in the same areas of Africa. Most terrestrial predators in their habitat were no bigger than a modern wolf and were not a threat to Paraceratherium. Adult individuals would be too large for any land predators to attack, but the young would have been vulnerable. Bite marks on bones from the Bugti beds indicate that even adults may have been preyed on by -long crocodiles, Crocodylus bugtiensis. As in elephants, the gestation period of Paraceratherium may have been lengthy and individuals may have had long lifespans. Paraceratherium may have lived in small herds, perhaps consisting of females and their calves, which they protected from predators. It has been proposed that may be the maximum weight possible for land mammals, and Paraceratherium was close to this limit. The reasons mammals cannot reach the much larger size of sauropod dinosaurs are unknown. The reason may be ecological instead of biomechanical, and perhaps related to reproduction strategies. Movement, sound, and other behaviours seen in CGI documentaries such as Walking With Beasts are entirely conjectural. =Diet and feeding= P. transouralicum skull illustration The simple, low- crowned teeth indicate that Paraceratherium was a browser with a diet consisting of relatively soft leaves and shrubs. Later rhinoceroses were grazers, with high-crowned teeth because their diets contained grit that quickly wore down their teeth. Studies of mesowear on Paraceratherium teeth confirm the creatures had a diet of soft leaves; microwear studies have yet to be conducted. Isotope analysis shows that Paraceratherium fed chiefly on C3 plants, which are mainly leaves. Like its perissodactyl relatives, the horses, tapirs, and other rhinoceroses, Paraceratherium would have been a hindgut fermenter; it would extract relatively little nutrition from its food and would have to eat large volumes to survive. Like other large herbivores, Paraceratherium would have had a large digestive tract. Granger and Gregory argued that the large incisors were used for defence or for loosening shrubs by moving the neck downwards, thereby acting as picks and levers. Tapirs use their proboscis to wrap around branches while stripping off bark with the front teeth; this ability would have been helpful to Paraceratherium. Some Russian authors suggested that the tusks were probably used for breaking twigs, stripping bark and bending high branches and that, because species from the early Oligocene had larger tusks than later ones, they probably had a more bark than leaf based diet. Since the species involved are now known to have been contemporaneous, and the differences in tusks are now thought to be sexually dimorphic, the latter idea is not accepted today. Herds of Paraceratherium may have migrated while continuously foraging from tall trees, which smaller mammals could not reach. Osborn suggested that its mode of foraging would have been similar to that of the high-browsing giraffe and okapi, rather than to modern rhinoceroses, whose heads are carried close to the ground. Distribution and habitat Locations of fossil finds Remains assignable to Paraceratherium have been found in early to late Oligocene (34‚Äì23 million years ago) formations across Eurasia, in modern-day China, Mongolia, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, and the Balkans. Their distribution may be correlated with the palaeogeographic development of the Alpine-Himalayan mountain belt. The range of Paraceratherium finds implies that they inhabited a continuous landmass with a similar environment across it, but this is contradicted by palaeogeographic maps that show this area had various marine barriers, so the genus was successful in being widely distributed despite this. The fauna which coexisted with Paraceratherium included other rhinoceroses, artiodactyls, rodents, beardogs, weasels, hyaenodonts, nimravids and cats. Restoration of a P. transouralicum pair, with two Hyaenodon below The habitat of Paraceratherium appears to have varied across its range, based on the types of geological formations it has been found in. The Hsanda Gol Formation of Mongolia represents an arid desert basin, and the environment is thought to have had few tall trees and limited brush cover, as the fauna consisted mainly of animals that fed from tree tops or close to the ground. A study of fossil pollen showed that much of China was woody shrubland, with plants such as saltbush, mormon tea (Ephedra), and nitre bush (Nitraria), all adapted to arid environments. Trees were rare, and concentrated near groundwater. The parts of China where Paraceratherium lived had dry lakes and abundant sand dunes, and the most common plant fossils are leaves of the desert-adapted Palibinia. Trees in Mongolia and China included birch, elm, oaks, and other deciduous trees, while Siberia and Kazakhstan also had walnut trees. Dera Bugti in Pakistan had dry, temperate to subtropical forest. Extinction The reasons Paraceratherium became extinct after surviving for about 11 million years are unknown, but it is unlikely that there was a single cause. Theories include climate change, low reproduction rate, and invasion by gomphothere proboscideans from Africa in the late Oligocene (between 28 and 23 million years ago). Gomphotheres may have been able to considerably change the habitats they entered, in the same way that African elephants do today, by destroying trees and turning woodland into grassland. Once their food source became scarce and their numbers dwindled, Paraceratherium populations would have become more vulnerable to other threats. Large predators like Hyainailurus and Amphicyon also entered Asia from Africa during the early Miocene (between 23 and 16 million years ago); these may have preyed on Paraceratherium calves. Other herbivores also invaded Asia during this time.Prothero, 2013. pp. 107‚Äì121 References Bibliography * Category:Oligocene rhinoceroses Category:Aquitanian genus extinctions Category:Prehistoric mammal genera Category:Rupelian genus first appearances Category:Hyracodonts Category:Fossil taxa described in 1911 Category:Taxa named by Clive Forster-Cooper ","title":"Paraceratherium"},{"id":"2199069","text":"Iranian Canadians or Persian Canadians are citizens of Canada whose national background is traced from Iran or are people possessing Iranian and Canadian dual citizenship.

According to the 2016 Census there were 219,555 Canadians who claimed Lebanese ancestry, showing an increase compared to the 2006 Census, making them by far the largest group of people with Arabic-speaking roots.  History  Lebanese immigration began in 1882. The first Lebanese immigrant to Canada was Abraham Bounadere (Ibrahim Abu Nadir) from Zahl√© in Lebanon who settled in Montreal. Because of situations within Lebanon and restrictive Canadian laws these immigrants were 90% Christian. These immigrants were mostly economic migrants seeking greater prosperity in the New World. In more recent years this pattern has changed, and large numbers of Lebanese Muslims and Druze have come to Canada. Immigration laws were liberalized after the Second World War, and immigration steadily increased in the 1950s and 1960s. The greatest influx of Lebanese was during the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990), and this period saw a number of Lebanon's wealthiest and best educated move to Canada to flee the violence in their homeland. Canada and Australia were the only western countries to set up special programs to enable Lebanese to more easily emigrate. Canada set up an office in Cyprus to process Lebanese refugees. The media has reported that as many as 50,000 of Lebanese-Canadians were in Lebanon during the summer of 2006, with about half of them permanently residing there.Canada and Lebanon, a special tie from CBC 1 August 2006 During 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict the large number of Canadians caught in the middle of the Israeli onslaught led to a major effort to evacuate them from the war zone. It also led some to accuse some of those holding Canadian citizenship of being Canadians of convenience.  Demography  Many Lebanese speak French and prefer to settle in francophone Montreal rather than anglophone Toronto and Vancouver, British Columbia. About half the Lebanese-Canadian community is located in and around Montreal, and most Lebanese-Canadian organizations, especially religious ones, are based in that city. Lebanese Canadians account for a larger share of the population of Ottawa than that of any other census metropolitan area across the country, constituting over 2% of the total population of the National Capital Region. Canadians of Lebanese origin also made up more than 1% of the total populations of both Montreal and Halifax, while the figure was close to 1% in both Calgary and Edmonton. In Toronto, people of Lebanese origin made up less than a half a per cent of the total population. There are also substantial Lebanese populations in Vancouver, Windsor, London, Edmonton, Fredericton and Charlottetown.

The first paraceratheres were only about the size of large dogs, growing progressively larger in the late Eocene and Oligocene. They were most common in the rainforest floodplain region which is now Kazakhstan, India, and southwest China, and lived further inland throughout northern and central Asia as well. The paraceratheres reached the peak of their evolution from the middle Oligocene to the early Miocene, where they became very large, herbivorous mammals. Most genera were about the size of modern draft horses and the extinct giant horse Equus giganteus, with some growing significantly larger. The largest genus was Paraceratherium, which was more than twice as heavy as a bull African elephant, and was one of the largest land mammals that ever lived. However, they remained confined to Asia, which at the time was mostly lush lowland floodplains. No fossil remains of paraceratheres have been found in Europe or North America, even though the paraceratheres had millions of years of opportunities to reach those regions. The collision with the Indian subcontinent and the Himalayan uplift led to global cooling, desertification, and the disappearance of forest habitats, which resulted in the extinction of these giant ungulates. Although considered a subfamily of the Hyracodontidae by some authors, recent authors treat the paraceratheres as a distinct family, Paraceratheriidae (Wang et al. 2016 recover hyracodonts as more basal than paraceratheres).Z.

They are chiefly defined by the presence of a brood pouch, or marsupium, formed from thin flattened plates (oostegites) borne on the basalmost segments of the legs. Peracarida is one of the largest crustacean taxa and includes about 12,000 species. Most members are less than in length, but the largest is probably the giant isopod (Bathynomus giganteus) which can reach . Characteristics General bauplan of a peracarid mandibula: 1. Molar process; 2. Spine row; 3. Lacinia mobilis; 4. Incisor process; 5. Palp The most obvious characteristic of the group is the marsupium in females. This brood pouch is enclosed by the large, flexible oostergites, bristly flaps which extend from the basal segments of the thoracic appendages, which form the floor of a chamber roofed by the animal's sternum. This chamber is where the eggs are brooded, development being direct in most cases. Other characteristics include the possession of a single pair of maxillipeds (rarely 2‚Äì3), of mandibles with an articulated accessory process between the molar and incisor teeth in the adults (called the lacinia mobilis), and of a carapace which is often reduced in size and is not fused with the posterior thoracic somites. In some orders, the young hatch at a post-larval, prejuvenile stage called a manca which lacks the last pair of legs. In the underground order Thermosbaenacea, there are no oostergites and the carapace of the female is expanded to form a dorsal marsupium. Orders There is some disagreement as to which orders should be included within Peracarida. Martin & Davies include the following eleven orders: *Amphipoda Latreille, 1816 *Cumacea Kr√∏yer, 1846 *Isopoda Latreille, 1817 *Lophogastrida Sars, 1870 *Mictacea Bowman, Garner, Hessler, Iliffe & Sanders, 1985 *Mysida Haworth, 1825 *‚Ä†Pygocephalomorpha Beurlen, 1930 (only known from fossil remains) *Spelaeogriphacea Gordon, 1957 *Tanaidacea Dana, 1849 *Thermosbaenacea Monod, 1927 but Ruppert, Fox and Barnes exclude Thermosbaenacea and place it in a separate order, Pancarida. They also place Lophogastrida, Mysida and Pygocephalomorpha in a single order, Mysidacea. This arrangement is disputed by Meland and Willassen who found that molecular data shows that the three orders are not closely related.

Bronllys is also the name of an electoral ward to Powys County Council. The community includes Llyswen. Description The village is in the historic county of Brecknockshire (Breconshire). It has recently benefited from a new bypass as part of the Talgarth Relief Road and Bronllys Bypass scheme. Despite being a small village it has a swimming pool and small leisure centre, post office and hospital.  Bronllys Castle  Bronllys Castle motte and tower Bronllys Castle is a motte and bailey fortress standing south of the village, towards Talgarth. The castle was founded in or soon after 1100, by Richard Fitz Pons, the owner of the adjacent Herefordshire barony of Clifford, who was a supporter of Bernard of Neufmarch√©, Lord of Brecknock (in which the land around Bronllys fell). Richard's castle was of the motte-and-bailey design, but only wooden. In 1521, the year the castle became a crown property, the antiquarian John Leland went to inspect it, reporting that it had fallen into great disrepair; by 1583 the disrepair was substantially worse. It is now in the care of Cadw, the arm of the Welsh Assembly charged with care of historic monuments and is open to the public between April and October.  Bedo Brwynllys  The minor Welsh bard Bedo Brwynllys lived in Bronllys in the 15th century. His poetry is characteristic of a follower or imitator of Dafydd ap Gwilym and is mainly love poetry or religious poetry and some eulogistic poems such as his elegy for Sir Richard Herbert of Coldbrook, written in 1469. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward includes Erwood and at the 2011 Census had a total population of 1,282. The ward elects a county councillor to Powys County Council.

Its original German title is Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (Nosferatu: Phantom of the Night). The film is set primarily in 19th-century Wismar, Germany and Transylvania, and was conceived as a stylistic remake of F. W. Murnau's 1922 German Dracula adaptation Nosferatu. The picture stars Klaus Kinski as Count Dracula, Isabelle Adjani as Lucy Harker, Bruno Ganz as Jonathan Harker, and French artist-writer Roland Topor as Renfield. There are two different versions of the film, one in which the actors speak English, and one in which they speak German. Herzog's production of Nosferatu was very well received by critics and enjoyed a comfortable degree of commercial success. The film also marks the second of five collaborations between director Herzog and actor Kinski, immediately followed by 1979's Woyzeck. The film had 1,000,000 admissions in West Germany and grossed ITL 53,870,000 in Italy. The film was also a modest success in Adjani's home country, taking in 933,533 admissions in France. A novelization of the screenplay was written by Paul Monette and published by both Avon Publishing () and Picador () in 1979. The 1988 Italian horror film Nosferatu in Venice is an \\"in-name-only\\" sequel, again featuring Kinski in the title role. Plot Jonathan Harker is an estate agent in Wismar, Germany. His employer, Renfield, informs him that a nobleman named Count Dracula wishes to buy a property in Wismar, and assigns Harker to visit the Count and complete the lucrative deal. Leaving his young wife Lucy behind in Wismar, Harker travels to Transylvania, to the castle of Count Dracula, in a journey that lasts four weeks, carrying with him the deeds and documents needed to sell the house to the Count. On his journey, Harker stops at a village inn, where the locals plead for him to stay away from the accursed castle, providing him with details of Dracula's vampirism. Ignoring the villagers' pleas as superstition, Harker continues his journey, ascending the Borgo Pass on foot and eventually arriving at Dracula's castle, where he meets the Count, a strange, almost rodent-like man, with large ears, pale skin, sharp teeth, and long fingernails. The Count is enchanted by a small portrait of Lucy and immediately agrees to purchase the Wismar property, especially with the knowledge that he and Lucy would become neighbors. As Jonathan's visit progresses, he is haunted at night by a number of dream-like encounters with the vampiric Count. Simultaneously, in Wismar, Lucy is tormented by night terrors, plagued by images of impending doom. Additionally, Renfield is committed to an asylum after biting a cow, apparently having gone completely insane. To Harker's horror, he finds the Count asleep in a coffin, confirming for him that Dracula is indeed a vampire. That night, Dracula leaves for Wismar, taking with him a number of coffins filled with the cursed earth that he needs for his vampiric rest. Harker finds that he is imprisoned in the castle and attempts to escape through a window via a makeshift rope fashioned from bedsheets. The rope is not long enough, and Jonathan falls, severely injuring himself. He awakes on the ground the next morning, stirred by the sound of a young Gypsy boy playing a violin. He is eventually sent to a hospital and raves about 'black coffins' to doctors, who assume that the illness is affecting his mind. Meanwhile, Dracula and his coffins travel to Wismar by ship via the Black Sea Port of Varna, thence through the Bosphorus and Gibraltar straits and around the entire west European Atlantic coast to the Baltic Sea. He systematically kills the entire crew, making it appear as if they were afflicted with plague. The ghost ship arrives, with its cargo, at Wismar, where doctors ‚Äì including Abraham Van Helsing ‚Äì investigate the strange fate of the ship. They discover a ship's log that mentions their perceived affliction with plague. Wismar is then flooded with rats from the ship. Dracula arrives in Wismar with his coffins, and death spreads rapidly throughout the town. The desperately ill Jonathan is finally transported home, but when he finally arrives he does not appear to recognize his wife. Lucy later has an encounter with Count Dracula; weary and unable to die, he demands some of the love that she gave so freely to Jonathan, but she refuses, much to Dracula's dismay. Now aware that something other than plague is responsible for the death that has beset her once-peaceful town, Lucy desperately tries to convince the townspeople, but they are skeptical and uninterested. From a book given to Jonathan by the people in Transylvania, she finds that she can vanquish Dracula's evil by distracting him until dawn, at which time the rays of the sun will destroy him, but only at the cost of her own life. That night, she lures the Count to her bedroom, where he proceeds to drink her blood. Lucy's beauty and purity distract Dracula from the call of the rooster, and at the first light of day, he collapses to the floor, dead. Van Helsing arrives to discover Lucy dead but victorious. He then drives a stake through the heart of the Count to make sure that Lucy's sacrifice was not in vain. In a final ironic twist, Jonathan awakens from his sickness, now a vampire, and has Van Helsing arrested for the murder of Count Dracula. He then states enigmatically that he has much to do, and is last seen riding away on horseback, garbed in the same fluttering black as Dracula.

W. Murnau's silent film Nosferatu (1922), which differs somewhat from Stoker's original work. The makers of the earlier film could not obtain the rights for a film adaptation of Dracula, so they changed a number of minor details and character names in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid copyright infringement on the intellectual property owned (at the time) by Stoker's widow Florence. A lawsuit was filed, resulting in an order for the destruction of all prints of the film. Some prints survived, and were restored after Florence Stoker had died and the copyright had expired. By the 1960s and early 1970s the original silent returned to circulation, and was enjoyed by a new generation of moviegoers. Herzog considered Murnau's Nosferatu to be the greatest film ever to come out of Germany, and was eager to make his own version of the film, with Klaus Kinski in the leading role. In 1979, by the very day the copyright for Dracula had entered the public domain, Herzog proceeded with his updated version of the classic German film, which could now include the original character names. Herzog saw his film as a parable about the fragility of order in a staid, bourgeois town. \\"It is more than a horror film\\", he says. \\"Nosferatu is not a monster, but an ambivalent, masterful force of change. When the plague threatens, people throw their property into the streets, they discard their bourgeois trappings. A re‚Äêevaluation of life and its meaning takes place.\\"The New York Times, 30 July 1978 Adjani said about her heroine: \\"There's a sexual element. She is gradually attracted towards Nosferatu. She feels a fascination ‚Äî as we all would, think. First, she hopes to save the people of the town by sacrificing herself. But then, there is a moment of transition. There is a scene when he isn't sucking her blood ‚Äî sucking and sucking like an animal‚Äîand suddenly her face takes on a new expression, a sexual one, and she will not let him go away any more. There is a desire that has been born. A moment like this has never been seen in a vampire picture\\". According to Kinski: \\"We see Dracula sympathetically [in this film]. He is a man without free will. He cannot choose and he cannot cease to be. He is a kind of incarnation of evil, but he is also a man who is suffering, suffering for love. This makes it so much more dramatic, more double‚Äêedged.\\" =Filming= Nosferatu the Vampyre was co- produced by Werner Herzog Filmproduktion, French film company Gaumont, and West German public-service television station ZDF. As was common for West German films during the 1970s, Nosferatu the Vampyre was filmed on a minimal budget, and with a crew of just 16 people. Herzog could not film in Wismar, where the original Murnau film was shot, so he relocated production to Delft, Netherlands. Parts of the film were shot in nearby Schiedam, after the Delft authorities refused to allow Herzog to release 11,000 rats for a scene in the film. Dracula's home is represented by locations in Czechoslovakia. At the request of distributor 20th Century Fox, Herzog produced two versions of the film simultaneously, to appeal to English-speaking audiences. Scenes with dialogue were filmed twice, in German and in English, meaning that the actors' own voices (as opposed to dubbed dialogue by voice actors) could be included in the English version of the film. Herzog himself said in 2014 that the German version was more \\"authentic\\", but wouldn't disavow the English version. The opening sequence was filmed by Herzog himself at the Mummies of Guanajuato museum in Guanajuato, Mexico, where a large number of naturally mummified bodies of the victims of an 1833 cholera epidemic are on public display. Herzog had first seen the Guanajuato mummies while visiting in the 1960s. On his return in the 1970s he took the corpses out of the glass cases in which they are normally stored. To film them, he propped them against a wall, arranging them in a sequence running roughly from childhood to old age. Kinski's Dracula make-up, with black costume, bald head, rat-like teeth and long fingernails, is an imitation of Max Schreck's makeup in the 1922 original. The makeup artist who worked on Kinski was Japanese artist Reiko Kruk. Although he fought with Herzog and others during the making of other films, Kinski got along with Kruk, and the four-hour makeup sessions went on with no outbursts from Kinski himself. A number of shots in the film are faithful recreations of iconic shots from Murnau's original film, some almost perfectly identical to their counterparts, intended as homages to Murnau. =Music= The film score to Nosferatu the Vampyre was composed by the West German group Popol Vuh, who have collaborated with Herzog on numerous projects. Music for the film comprises material from the group's album Br√ºder des Schattens ‚Äì S√∂hne des Lichts. Additionally, the film features Richard Wagner's prelude to Das Rheingold, Charles Gounod's \\"Sanctus\\" from Messe solennelle √† Sainte C√©cile and traditional Georgian folk song \\"Tsintskaro\\", sung by Vocal Ensemble Gordela. =Animal cruelty= Dutch behavioral biologist Maarten 't Hart, hired by Herzog for his expertise with laboratory rats, revealed that, after witnessing the inhumane way in which the rats were treated, he no longer wished to cooperate. Apart from travelling conditions that were so poor that the rats, imported from Hungary, had started to eat each other upon arrival in the Netherlands, Herzog insisted the plain white rats be dyed gray. In order to do so, according to Hart, the cages containing the rats needed to be submerged in boiling water for several seconds, causing another half of them to die. The surviving rats proceeded to lick themselves clean of the dye immediately, as Hart had predicted they would. Hart also implied sheep and horses that appear in the movie were treated very poorly, but did not specify this any further.Maarten 't Hart in Zomergasten, VPRO, 2010-08-01. Release Released as Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht in German and Nosferatu the Vampyre in English, the film was entered into the 29th Berlin International Film Festival, where production designer Henning von Gierke won the Silver Bear for an outstanding single achievement. =Critical response= Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports a 94% approval critic response based on 54 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website's critical consensus states: \\"Stunning visuals from Werner Herzog and an intense portrayal of the famed bloodsucker from Klaus Kinski make this remake of Nosferatu a horror classic in its own right.\\" In contemporary reviews, the film is noted for maintaining an element of horror, with numerous deaths and a grim atmosphere, but it features a more expanded plot than many Dracula productions, with a greater emphasis on the vampire's tragic loneliness. Dracula is still a ghastly figure, but with a greater sense of pathos; weary, unloved, and doomed to immortality. Reviewer John J. Puccio of MovieMet considers it a faithful homage to Murnau's original film, significantly updating the original material, and avoiding the danger of being overly derivative. In 2011, Roger Ebert added the film to his \\"Great Movies Collection\\". Concluding his four-star review, Ebert said: > One striking quality of the film is its beauty. Herzog's pictorial eye is > not often enough credited. His films always upstage it with their themes. We > are focused on what happens, and there are few 'beauty shots'. Look here at > his control of the color palette, his off-center compositions, of the > dramatic counterpoint of light and dark. Here is a film that does honor to > the seriousness of vampires. No, I don't believe in them. But if they were > real, here is how they must look.

Distribution and ecology C. quadricarinatus is found in permanent freshwater streams, billabongs and lakes on the north coast of the Northern Territory and northeastern Queensland. Populations are also found in Papua New Guinea. Through translocation by humans, the range has spread down to southern Queensland and into the far north of West Australia. C. quadricarinatus is considered an invasive species, and has established feral populations in South Africa, Mexico, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Indonesia, Zambia and Singapore. This tropical crustacean is very tolerant of environmental changes, and is primarily a detritivore. Description The colour of C. quadricarinatus ranges from dark brown to blue-green and adult males have a distinct red patch on the outer margin of the claws. They can reach up to . Life cycle Females, which are smaller than males, spawn 300‚Äì800 olive-green eggs per brood, which are fertilised from a spermatophore which the male has deposited at the base of her walking legs (pereiopods) during mating. Fertilised eggs are affixed to the female's pleopods, situated on the underside of the tail. Incubation takes approximately six weeks and the newly hatched juveniles rapidly become independent. Aquaculture C. quadricarinatus is farmed commercially in Queensland and the Northern Territory, and is harvested at between . C. quadricarinatus is a sought-after product with a delicate crustacean flavour. They are both non-aggressive in nature as well as highly fertile, and can therefore be bred in large numbers in captivity. Time to sexual maturity, and therefore harvest size, is somewhere between six and twelve months in optimally farmed conditions.

At larger shows, there might be several judges, with each responsible for only certain breeds or classes. Qualifications Because dogs are judged based on how well they conform to their breed's breed standard, a judge must be intimately familiar with the particular breed's standard and must be able to analyze the qualities of the dog to determine its relative quality. Usually a license as a dog judge is granted by either a breed association or a kennel club. The license specifies the different breeds over which the judge is qualified to officiate. Judges may study and, over time, apply for a license to judge a single breed, multiple breeds, or all recognized breeds. A judge who has successfully completed the requirements for judging all of the dog groups is known as a group judge. A judge who is licensed to judge all breeds is often referred to as an \\"all-rounder\\". In some cases the qualification and membership of a National-based organisation is the criteria as to how a judge might operate.http://www.dogjudge.com/http://www.adsj.org/ A few international groups and accreditation also exist Travelling judges Judges are most commonly licensed specifically to the registry with which they are affiliated (for example, American Kennel Club judges judge AKC shows). However, some registries choose to recognize licensed judges from other registries and organizations. Judging outside of one's country or registry is often an indication of a particular appreciation of that judge's skills and knowledge. Famous judges Some judges who are regulars at the larger English or American dog shows become well known among dog show participants and breeders and gain respect from large audiences for their ability to recognise good examples of the breeds that they judge.

Early life Sloman was born in Oldham, Lancashire but his family moved to Plymouth when he was two years old. He attended Exeter University. Writing In the early 1970s he made a significant contribution to the science fiction programme Doctor Who on the BBC. Together with then producer Barry Letts, he wrote four stories for the Jon Pertwee era on the programme: The D√¶mons (credited as Guy Leopold); The Time Monster; The Green Death; and Planet of the Spiders, which was Pertwee's final serial. The first of these is often one of the most well regarded in the programme's history; while the others contained strong moral messages, especially the focus on pollution and globalisation in The Green Death. When The Green Death was released on DVD in 2004, Sloman contributed a feature on the writing of the story. Sloman had also planned to bring the Daleks back at the end of the third Pertwee season, Season 9, in a serial called The Daleks in London. This plan was dropped when the production staff realised that the show wouldn't have a hook for the start of the season to entice viewers, and Sloman's serial was allegedly shaping up to be too similar to The Dalek Invasion of Earth. Instead, writer Louis Marks was asked to alter his serial to include the Daleks ‚Äì which became Day of the Daleks. Robert Sloman also co-wrote two plays in the West End, both co-written with Laurence Dobie: The Golden Rivet, and The Tinker; the latter was later turned into a film, The Wild and the Willing, in 1962.

It is a frazione of the town of Vibo Valentia. It has around 10,000 inhabitants. The town lies in the Gulf of Saint Euphemia, on the Tyrrhenian Sea. Pizzo and Bivona are nearby; other important towns near Vibo Marina are Vibo Valentia, Lamezia Terme and Tropea. History In the 3rd century BC, Agathocles the tyrant of Syracuse ordered the construction of a harbour where Vibo Marina now stands. The installation of the harbour goes from the caste of Bivona to the high part of Vibo Marina, where a Roman manor had existed in ancient times. Vibo Marina was originally called Porto Santa Venere (Saint Venus' Harbour). A legend tells that the local fishermen discovered on the sandy shore a statue of Saint Venus. Under the Fascist government, the name was changed in 1928 to Vibo Marina. On 8 September 1943 part of the 8th Army, 231st Brigade landed at what the allies still referred to as Porto San Venere (Vibo Marina) with the intention of cutting off as many German units as possible who were expected to retreat from the main force of the British Commonwealth Eighth Army landings at the toe of Italy at Reggio Calabria via the coast road Strada statale 18 and the rail line passing close to the port. The Operation Ferdy landing force consisted of naval units flagship Motor Torpedo Boat MTB 77; Monitor HMS Erebus (I02); Two Insect Class gunboats HMS Aphis and HMS Scarab; Two Landing Ship Tank (LST), 9 & 65; 18 Landing Craft Tank (LCT) including 4, 306, & 316; Two Landing Craft Gun including LCG 12; Two Landing Craft Flack (LCF); 24 Landing Craft Infantry (LCI) and Harbour Defence Motor Launch HDML 1128. The landings were led by 40 Commando and 3 Commando. Enemy opposition to the landing was unexpectedly heavy included fire from machine guns, mortars and 88mm artillery guns. At 7am German Fw 190 aircraft attacked the ships and sank MTB 77 the flagship of the landing force and the injured Rear Admiral McGrigor was rescued by HDML 1128. Monitor HMS Erebus which was armed with twin 15‚Äù guns was called in to provide much needed naval artillery fire at about 17.45pm along with the two shallow draft Insect Class Gunboats Aphis and Scarab with their 6‚Äù guns. Fighting continued the next day, an assault from Panzergrenadiers penetrated to within a mile of the landing beaches however by 23.00 that night the German troops ceased their artillery fire, disengaged and headed rapidly north towards Sapri.http://comuneportosantavenere.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/operation- ferdy-8-sept-allied-landing.html Economy It is an important industrial area in the economy of the Vibo Valentia province.

Germaine's father was John of Foix, Viscount of Narbonne and son of Queen Eleanor of Navarre. Her mother, Marie of Orl√©ans, was the sister of King Louis XII of France.  Queenship  Following the death of his wife, Isabella I, in 1504, Ferdinand had to yield the government of Castile to his son-in-law Philip of Burgundy (1478‚Äì1506), who assumed power in the name of his wife Joanna (1479‚Äì1555), Isabella's heiress. Ferdinand objected to Philip's policies and to prevent Philip from gaining Aragon through Joanna, he sought to have a male heir with a new wife. A new male heir would displace Joanna (and by extension her husband) from the line of succession. He negotiated with King Louis XII of France for a marriage, hoping to gain accession to the throne of Navarre. At the Treaty of Blois, Louis agreed to have his niece Germaine of Foix marry Ferdinand; Germaine was Louis' niece (daughter of his sister) and Ferdinand's grandniece (granddaughter of his half-sister). Louis XII also ceded in the treaty his weak claim to the Kingdom of Naples (already controlled by Aragon) and Kingdom of Jerusalem (controlled by neither) to his niece, conditional on a male child being produced. The marriage, between Ferdinand (aged 54) and Germaine (aged 18), took place in March 1506.Frederic J. Baumgartner, Louis XII, (St. Martin's Press, 1996), 146. A short truce and brief alliance between the two kings resulted, despite several wars before and after the Treaty. In 1506 Philip of Burgundy died and Ferdinand became regent of Castile for his mentally unstable daughter Joanna. Ferdinand and Germaine did have a son, John, Prince of Girona on 3 May 1509, but he died shortly after birth. Despite the use of love potions, they did not have another. If John had lived, then the Crown of Aragon would have split from the Crown of Castile once again (after being semi-unified by Ferdinand and Isabella's marriage). This included Aragon, Valencia, Majorca, and Catalonia in Spain, and the Kingdom of Naples, Sicily and Sardinia in the Italian peninsula and the Tyrrhenian Sea. With Juan's death, both Castile and Aragon would eventually go to Ferdinand and Isabella's daughter Joanna. Ferdinand's diplomatic deviousness and off-and-on alliances with France infuriated Henry VIII of England (born 1491, reigned 1509‚Äì1547), married to Ferdinand and Isabella's youngest daughter, Catherine of Aragon (1485‚Äì1536). Seeing this match devalued, Henry in 1514 forced his sister Mary (1496‚Äì1533) into a loveless marriage with Louis XII to spite Ferdinand. Louis XII died the next year.  Death of Ferdinand and Succession of Charles V  Ferdinand died after two years of health problems in 1516, leaving Germaine a widow. Ferdinand's successors were Joanna and her son Charles V. Ferdinand did, however, leave Germaine a yearly income of 50,000 gold florins, and exhorted his grandson Charles V in his last letter not to abandon her. In 1517, Charles V moved from the Netherlands to Castile as the new King of Castile and Aragon. Germaine moved from Aragon to Castile to join his court as well, where the 17-year-old king took well to his 29-year-old stepgrandmother. He organized several tournaments and banquets in her honor. On 20 August 1518, Germaine gave birth in Valencia to a daughter, Isabel. It is widely speculated among historians that Charles V was Isabel's father; Germaine refers to her in her will as the \\"Infanta Isabel\\", a title that would usually only be given to the daughter of a King.Wim Blockmans. Carlos V: la utop√≠a del imperio. Madrid: Alianza Editorial, 2000. Page 150.Manuel Fern√°ndez √Ålvarez. Carlos V, el C√©sar y el hombre. Madrid: Espasa Editorial, 1999. Page 591. Charles V, Germaine, and Charles V's sister Eleanor moved from Castile to Aragon in 1519, where he would be formally sworn in as King of Aragon. He would spend a year in Aragon, negotiating with its parliament and managing affairs. While in Barcelona, Charles V arranged for Germaine to marry the margrave Johann of Brandenburg-Ansbach, a landless cadet and cousin of Joachim I, Elector of Brandenburg. Germaine left Spain to travel with Charles V to Germany, where she was married.  Vicereine of Valencia  In 1523 Charles V appointed the couple jointly viceroys of Valencia. There Germaine, recently returned to Spain, dealt with the fallout of the Revolt of the Brotherhoods by the Valencian guilds (Germanies). Germaine favored harsh treatment of the agermanats; she is thought to have signed the death warrants of 100 former rebels personally, and sources indicate that as many as 800 executions may have occurred in total. This undid the more lenient policy of Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, who had favored reconciliation with the rebels. In December 1524, Germaine signed a pardon that officially ended the persecution of all former participants in the rebellion. However, fines imposed on the guilds and guild- aligned cities as punishment would take many years to be repaid. It is maintained by Valencian historians that the fact that Germaine moved her court to Valencia was the first step in the degradation of social prestige of the Valencian language in the Kingdom of Valencia, as the higher classes started favouring Castilian/Spanish over their native language to please her. Next year after Johann's death in 1525, Germaine married Ferdinand, Duke of Calabria, a son of King Frederick IV of Naples (1496‚Äì1501) by his second wife Isabella del Balzo. The two continued as viceroys of Valencia and were patrons of the arts and music. Germaine also encouraged the slow integration of Valencia with Castilian-dominated Spain as a whole. Germaine died on 15 October 1536 in Liria, probably due to obesity related edema, and was interred in the Monastery of San Miguel de los Reyes.Real Academia de la historia: Diccionario Bibliogr√°fico espa√±ol - Germana de Foix The Duke of Calabria continued in office until his death in 1550.

Background Sidney Faithorn Green was born in Kent in 1841. he studied at Tonbridge School and Cambridge University. Green was ordained a priest of the Church of England in Manchester in 1866, and served as a curate in Swinton until his appointment as incumbent of St John the Evangelist, Miles Platting, Manchester. He was a follower of the Oxford Movement who celebrated the Eucharist in the style of Anglo-Catholicism, see Anglican Eucharistic theology. Timeline of the ritual controversy at Miles Platting *June 1869: Green is appointed incumbent of St. John's, Miles Platting, Manchester. *January 1871: Green is admonished by Bishop of Manchester James Fraser for mixing water with wine in the service of Holy Communion. Green agrees to abandon the practice. *1874: Green nominates Rev. Harry Cowgill as his curate but Fraser refuses to approve the nomination on the grounds of Cowgill's avowed refusal to accept the authority of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in church matters. *May 1877, Fraser learns that Green is using incense and unlawful vestments, perceived as trappings of Anglo-Catholicism, in his services. Green is again admonished and agrees to abandon the practice. *May 18, 1878: Fraser receives a petition purporting to be from 320 of Green's parishioners accusing him of propagation of false doctrine and deadly error. *May 20, 1878: Fraser responds coolly, pointing out the vagueness of the accusations and the similarity of the handwriting in many of the \\"signatures\\". *December 2, 1878: The Church Association takes up the case and Fraser receives a \\"presentation\\" against Green charging, contrary to the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874: *#The mixing of wine and water. *#Lighted candles. *#Unlawful vestments. *#Kneeling during the prayer of consecration. *#Elevating the paten and chalice. *#Placing the alms on the credence instead of allowing them to lie on the Holy Table. *#Using the sign of the cross towards the congregation. *#Performing the consecration in such a manner that the congregation could not see him break the bread or take the chalice in his hand. *#Unlawfully and ceremoniously raising the chalice. *#Unlawfully displaying a large brass cross. *#Displaying a baldacchino. *December 3, 1878: At an interview with Fraser, Green declines to submit to his authority on liturgical matters as I should deny my Lord and imperil (peril?) my own salvation. Fraser declines to invoke his discretion to stay proceedings under the Act. *December 23, 1878: Fraser receives a petition supporting Green but is unimpressed by the standing of the signatories. *June 14, 1879: The case is tried before James Plaisted Wilde, Baron Penzance who upholds the charges. *August 9, 1879: A monition is issued to Green prohibiting the practices complained of. Green persists and an order is made inhibiting him from exercising the cure of souls. Green persists and is held to be in contempt of court. *November 25, 1879: Lord Penzance issues a significavit to the Court of Chancery of the county palatine of Lancaster notifying Green's contempt. *March 9, 1880: The court issues the writ de contumace capiendo. *March 19, 1880: Green is arrested and held in Lancaster Castle. Cowgill, without the bishop's licence, takes Green's place at Miles Platting but Fraser takes no action for fear of inflaming the situation. *July 24, 1880: An application is made to Lord Penzance for a ruling that Green is in contempt for non-payment of costs of ¬£293 7s 8d. *October 22, 1880: An order for the sequestration of his property is served on Green. *March, 1881: An application is made to the Lord Chancellor, Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne, to take possession of Green's effects. The application is opposed. *April 2, 1881: The application is heard but Selborne defers his decision because of an impending challenge to the Queen's Bench related to Lord Penzance's action. *April 6, 1881: An application for a writ of habeas corpus is dismissed by the Queen's Bench. *April 12, 1881: An appeal is dismissed by Lords Brett and Cotton. *May 7, 1881: Selborne denounces the costs awarded against Green as a great scandal. *May 20, 1881: Selborne reluctantly orders the sale of Green's effects. *May 21, 1881: The English Church Union obtain a legal opinion from Sir John Holker and E. Vaughan Williams favouring an appeal by Green and implore him to do so. *August 3‚Äì4, 1881: An appeal to the House of Lords is heard by Selborne, Lord Blackburn and Lord Watson. It is dismissed. *August 4, 1881: Green's effects are sold to defray the costs of the Church Association. *September 21, 1881: Fraser finally obtains an, at least nominal, undertaking from Green to obey his bishop's direction. Fraser writes to prime minister William Ewart Gladstone requesting that he petition Queen Victoria to exercise her Royal Prerogative to pardon Green. The case is forwarded to the Lord Chancellor, Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne, and Home Secretary, Sir William Vernon Harcourt. *October 25, 1881: Green writes to Fraser emphasising that his submission to episcopal authority will not extend to disobedience to his conscience in liturgical matters. *October 31, 1881: Fraser writes to Gladstone to withdraw his petition for a pardon. *January, 1882: A Mr. Leeds starts to assist Cowgill, who is suffering from anxiety and fatigue, at Miles Platting. Fraser takes no action despite Leeds' unlicensed status. *August, 1882: Selborne writes to Fraser to advise him that, three years having elapsed since the inhibition, Green's living at Miles Platting has lapsed under the Act. Green's detention now seems to serve little purpose but he was imprisoned for contempt and there is no trivial remedy. It seems unlikely that either Green or the Church Association will apply to the court for release but Fraser has no locus standi. *October 17, 1882: Fraser writes to Selborne advising him that Green is being guided by the English Church Union who regard deprivation of living under the Act with no greater gravity than any of its other provisions. *October 20, 1882: Fraser consults with his Chancellor, Richard Copley Christie, and writes to Selborne advising him of his resolve to free Green despite his fears for the consequences. *November 4, 1882: Fraser applies to Penzance for Green's release. The motion is unopposed, succeeds and Green is released that day. Green resigns his living in an attempt to deny the state's sequestration of his office. However, sequestration is already complete and Rev. W.R. Pym has been appointed as locum. Later life In 1883, Green was appointed to a curacy at St. John's, Kensington and then in 1889 as rector of Charlton by Dover, an avowedly ritualist parish of which Keble College, Oxford was patron. He became Rector of Luddenham with Stone in Kent in 1914 but soon retired due to ill health. He died in Sydenham on August 11, 1916.

Typically aromatization is achieved by dehydrogenation of existing cyclic compounds, illustrated by the conversion of cyclohexane into benzene. Aromatization includes the formation of heterocyclic systems. :The conversion of methylcyclohexane to toluene is a classic aromatization reaction. This platinum (Pt)-catalyzed process is practiced on scale in the production of gasoline from petroleum. Industrial practice Although not practiced under the name, aromatization is a cornerstone of oil refining. One of the major reforming reactions is the dehydrogenation of naphthenes into aromatics. The process, which is catalyzed by platinum, is exemplified in the conversion methylcyclohexane (a naphthene) into toluene (an aromatic). Dehydrocyclization converts paraffins (acyclic hydrocarbons) into aromatics. A related aromatization process includes dehydroisomerization of methylcyclopentane to benzene: :center Biochemical processes :center Aromatases are enzymes that partially aromatize steroids. The specific conversions are testosterone to estradiol and androstenedione to estrone. Each of these aromatizations involves the oxidation of the C-19 methyl group to formic acid to allow for the formation of the aromatic system, conversions which are necessary parts of estrogen tumorogenesis in the development of breast cancer and ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women and gynecomastia in men. Aromatase inhibitors like exemestane (which forms a permanent and deactivating bond with the aromatase enzyme) and anastrozole and letrozole (which compete for the enzyme) have been shown to be more effective than anti- estrogen medications such as tamoxifen likely because they prevent the formation of estradiol. Aromatization pathways =Oxidative dehydrogenation= For cyclohexane, cyclohexene, and cyclohexadiene, dehydrogenation is the conceptually simplest pathway for aromatization. The activation barrier decreases with the degree of unsaturation. Thus, cyclohexadienes are especially prone to aromatization. Formally, dehydrogenation is a redox process. Dehydrogenative aromatization is the reverse of arene hydrogenation. As such, hydrogenation catalysts are effective for the reverse reaction. Platinum-catalyzed dehydrogenations of cyclohexanes and related feedstocks are the largest scale applications of this reaction (see above). 2,3-Dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) is often the reagent of choice. DDQ and an acid catalyst has been used to synthesise a steroid with a phenanthrene core by oxidation accompanied by a double methyl migration. In the process, DDQ is itself reduced into an aromatic hydroquinone product. :center Sulfur and selenium are traditionally used in aromatization, the leaving group being hydrogen sulfide. Soluble transition metal complexes can induce oxidative aromatization concomitant with complexation. Œ±-Phellandrene (2-methyl-5-iso-propyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene) is oxidised to p-iso-propyltoluene with the reduction of ruthenium trichloride. Oxidative dehydrogenation of dihydropyridine results in aromatization, giving pyridine. =Dehydration= Semmler-Wolff synthesis of aniline Non-aromatic rings can be aromatized in many ways. Dehydration allows the Semmler-Wolff transformation of 2-cyclohexenone oxime to aniline under acidic conditions. =Tautomerization= 1,4-Dioxotetralin and its aromatized tautomer 1,4-naphthalenediol coexist in equal abundance in solution. The isomerization of cyclohexadienones gives the aromatic tautomer phenol. Isomerization of 1,4-naphthalenediol at 200 ¬∞C produces a 2:1 mixture with its keto form, 1,4-dioxotetralin. =Hydride and proton abstraction= Classically, aromatization reactions involve changing the C:H ratio of a substrate. When applied to cyclopentadiene, proton removal gives the aromatic conjugate base cyclopentadienyl anion, isolable as sodium cyclopentadienide: :2 Na + 2 C5H6 -> 2 NaC5H5 \\\\+ H2 Aromatization can entail removal of hydride. Tropylium, arises by the aromatization reaction of cycloheptatriene with hydride acceptors. : + ‚Üí + + Ciamician-Dennstedt rearrangement of a pyrrole to a pyridine. The first step involves dearomatization. The second step involves aromatization. =From acyclic precursors= The aromatization of acyclic precursors is rarer in organic synthesis, although it is a significant component of the BTX production in refineries. Among acyclic precursors, alkynes are relatively prone to aromatizations since they are partially dehydrogenated. The Bergman cyclization is converts an enediyne to a dehydrobenzene intermediate diradical, which abstracts hydrogen to aromatize. The enediyne moiety can be included within an existing ring, allowing access to a bicyclic system under mild conditions as a consequence of the ring strain in the reactant. Cyclodeca-3-en-1,5-diyne reacts with 1,3-cyclohexadiene to produce benzene and tetralin at 37 ¬∞C, the reaction being highly favorable owing to the formation of two new aromatic rings: :Scheme 1.

It is listed as a vulnerable species of crayfish by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), though wild yabby populations remain strong, and have expanded into new habitats created by reservoirs and farm dams. Other names frequently used for Cherax destructor include the blue yabby or cyan yabby. Its common name of \\"yabby\\" is also applied to many other Australian Cherax species of crustacean (as well as to marine ghost shrimp of the infraorder Thalassinidea). Yabbies occasionally reach up to in length, but are more commonly long. Colour is highly variable and depends on water clarity and habitat; yabbies can range from black, blue- black, or dark brown in clear waters to light brown, green-brown, or beige in turbid waters. Yabbies specifically bred to be a vibrant blue colour are now popular in the aquarium trade in Australia. An Australian yabby can travel up to across land in search of new waters to make its home. The word \\"yabby\\" comes from the Wemba Wemba, an Aboriginal Australian language.Oxford Dictionary of English, p 2,054. Dissemination Yabbys are common in Victoria and New South Wales, although the species also occurs in southern Queensland, South Australia, throughout parts of the Northern Territory and even as low as Tasmania, making it the most widespread Australian crayfish. It has been introduced to Western Australia, where it is an invasive species and poses a threat to other Cherax crayfish species native to the region, such as gilgies (Cherax quinquecarinatus). Yabbys are found in swamps, streams, rivers, reservoirs, and farm dams at low to medium elevations. Yabbys apparently were largely restricted to lower-altitude habitats in inland areas of south-eastern Australia including the Murray-Darling Basin before European settlement, with the Euastacus spiny crayfish species found in higher-altitude habitats and the coastal river systems. High-altitude yabby populations in Lakes Eucumbene and Jindabyne, on the upper reaches of the coastal Snowy River system, are unusual and may be translocated. Yabbys are found in many ephemeral waterways, and can survive dry conditions for several years by lying dormant in burrows sunk deep into muddy creek and swamp beds. Yabbys are primarily nocturnal detritivores, feeding primarily on algae and plant remains at night, but also opportunistically feeding on any fish or animal remains they encounter at any time of day. In Southern Australia, it is commonly accepted that yabbys are active and thereby available to catch during the warmer months. (Colloquially, any month with the letter \\"R\\" in it.) When temperatures fall below , they enter a state of reduced metabolic activity, or \\"partial hibernation\\". Yabbys are an important dietary item for Australian native freshwater fish such as Murray cod and golden perch. Catching Catching yabbies, or \\"yabbying\\", in rivers and farm dams is a popular summertime activity in Australia, particularly with children. The most popular method involves tying a piece of meat to a few metres of string or fishing line, which in turn is fastened to a stick in the bank, and throwing the meat into the water. The string is pulled tight when a determined yabby grasps the meat in its claws and tries to make off with it. The line is then slowly pulled back to the bank, with the grasping yabby usually maintaining its hold on the meat. When the meat and the grasping yabby reaches the water's edge, a net is used to quickly scoop up both the meat and the grasping yabby in one movement. Other methods of catching yabbies involve various types of nets and traps. Local fishing regulations must be checked before using any nets and traps for yabbies; many types of nets and traps are banned, as wildlife such as platypus, water rats, and long-necked turtles can become trapped in them and drown. Aquaculture Week-old yabby eggs, 2‚Äì3 mm, attached by minute hairs to underside of female abdomen, CSIRO The common yabby is a popular species for aquaculture, although their burrowing can destroy dams. Yabbies can also be found in private property dams where permission to fish must first be obtained. Bag limits apply to yabbies in most states. For example, in South Australia it is illegal to catch over 200 yabbies a day. All females carrying eggs under their tails must be returned to the water. Yabbies as food While less common than prawns and other crustaceans, yabbies are eaten in Australia much like crayfish in other countries. Usually, yabbies are boiled and eaten plain, or with condiments. They are also occasionally served at restaurants, where they may be prepared in salads, ravioli, pasta, etc. Prior to cooking, it is advisable to 'purge' the yabby in clean salt water, this helps to clear the gut of any muddy flavour, resulting in sweeter tasting meat. In New South Wales, yabbies can be sold live at some fish markets such as Sydney Fish Market. In Victoria, whole yabbies can be purchased cooked and ready to eat at Queen Victoria Market.

Alternative names for it include St. Patrick's cabbage, whimsey, prattling Parnell, and look up and kiss me. Before 1700 the ‚ÄúLondon pride‚Äù appellation was given to the sweet William (Dianthus barbatus).Brewers Dictionary of Phrase and Fable 18th edition, 2005 In 1846, Theresa Cornwallis West made a journey to Ireland. Near Dunloe in County Kerry \\"heareabouts grew quantities of our London Pride, and upon my expressing a wish for some roots to carry home, Sullivan [the driver] sprang down and tore up a large tuft. 'Ah, then,' said [our guide Spillane], 'that's too much entirely; why wouldn't ye leave some for the next comer?'\\" (A Summer Visit to the West of Ireland in 1846, p. 99). Taxonomy The \\"true\\" London pride is a hybrid between Saxifraga umbrosa, native to the Spanish Pyrenees, and Saxifraga spathularis (which is the plant to which the name St Patrick's Cabbage more correctly belongs, coming from western Ireland). The hybrid has been known at least since the 17th century. The name is sometimes applied to any of several closely related plants of the saxifrage genus. The section Gymnopera of the genus Saxifraga are collectively referred to as \\"London Pride saxifrages\\", and others of them have \\"London pride\\" in their common names, for example the lesser London pride, S. cuneifolia, and the miniature London pride, S. umbrosa var. primuloides. Description Close-up of blossom London pride is tolerant of dry, shady conditions. It grows to a height of and provides rapid ground cover without being aggressively invasive, and in late spring produces a mass of small pale pink rosette flowers growing from succulent stems. It will grow well in neglected or unfavourable urban spaces where few other flowers flourish, and is a common garden escapee. London pride planted in a garden This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Symbolism In particular, tradition holds that Saxifraga √ó urbium rapidly colonised the bombed sites left by the London Blitz of the early 1940s. As such it is symbolic of the resilience of London and ordinary Londoners, and of the futility of seeking to bomb them into submission. A song by No√´l Coward, celebrating London and the flower, achieved great popularity during the World War II years. In the language of flowers, London Pride is held to stand for frivolity, and its day is 27 July. Bishop Walsham How (1823‚Äì1897) wrote a poem to the flower rebuking it for having the sin of pride. When told the flower had the name because Londoners were proud of it he wrote another poem apologising to it.

LIPA was originally created under the Long Island Power Act of 1985 to acquire the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO)'s electric and natural gas infrastructure after the cancellation of the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant. LIPA acquired LILCO's transmission system in May 1998, while the remainder of LILCO's natural gas- related infrastructure merged with Brooklyn Union Gas to form KeySpan Energy. Since January 1, 2014, LIPA has contracted with New Jersey-based Public Service Enterprise Group to operate LIPA's electric infrastructure on LIPA's behalf for a period of 12 years. Before 2014, LIPA's electric and natural gas infrastructure was run under its own name, though KeySpan operated its electric and natural gas infrastructure under a prior management contract with LIPA until 2007. KeySpan merged with National Grid USA in 2007, and National Grid began operating the electric infrastructure portion of LIPA business until 2013. National Grid handed control of the electric infrastructure portion of LIPA business to PSEG at the close of business on December 31, 2013. KeySpan still operates the natural gas infrastructure on Long Island. LIPA's Long Island electric system provides service to over 1.1 million customers in Nassau and Suffolk counties, and the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens. LIPA does not own or operate any generation plants or retail natural gas assets on Long Island, although many generation plants are under contract to LIPA to meet its power supply needs. LIPA is listed as the \\"Owner, Operator and/or Billing Organization\\" for 27 different electric power generation facilities located on Long Island in the 2018 NYISO Gold Book, for a total of about 5,048-megawatts (MW) of nameplate capacity. Organization LIPA's policy is guided by a 9-member board of trustees. The LIPA management team is headed by Tom Falcone who was appointed CEO in March 2016. Ralph V. Suozzi is the chairman of LIPA's Board of Trustees, and was appointed by Governor Andrew Cuomo. In 2017, LIPA had operating expenses of $3.214 billion, an outstanding debt of $3.574 billion, and a level of staffing of 54 people. Although Public Service Law Section 3-b grants the New York State Public Service Commission the ability to review and make recommendations in regards to LIPA's electric retail rates and spending, the NYSPSC does not have the power to set those rates or expenditure levels. It can, however, inspect LIPA's facilities, books, and records. The New York State Public Service Commission runs its own field office on Long Island to enforce this recommendation and inspection capability. On January 24, 2007, then-Governor Eliot Spitzer announced that Kevin Law would replace Richard Kessel as Chairman of LIPA until the fall when a new Chairman would be named and Law would become Chief Executive Officer of LIPA.Rather, John. \\"New Governor, New Energy Czar\\", The New York Times, January 28, 2007.

LIPA is listed as the \\"Owner, Operator and/or Billing Organization\\" for 27 different electric power generation facilities located on Long Island in the 2018 NYISO Gold Book, for a total of about 5,048 MW of nameplate capacity. For comparison, Long Island had a peak electric demand of 4,972 MW and New York State had a peak demand of 29,699 MW in 2017. Utility Debt Securitization Authority The Utility Debt Securitization Authority is a separate New York State public-benefit corporation run by a governor-appointed board of trustees that is responsible for LIPA's financial reporting. In 2017, it had operating expenses of $122.2 million, an outstanding debt of $4.262 billion, and a level of staffing of 3 people. Controversy =Hurricane Sandy= On December 15, 2011, LIPA selected Public Service Enterprise Group of New Jersey, the largest electric utility of that state, to take over management and operation of the electric grid from National Grid, starting in January 2014. In 2012 and 2013, LIPA and National Grid caught much media criticism in their response to Hurricane Sandy. As a result, key people at LIPA resigned including Michael Hervey, COO of LIPA, who resigned on November 13, 2012 and, though not officially confirmed as a response to Sandy, Bruce Germano (VP of Customer Service) and X. Cristofer Damianos (Member of the Board of Trustees) who resigned on November 27, 2012, and LIPA chairman Howard Steinberg who resigned on November 30, 2012. On January 9, 2013, Governor Cuomo called for the transfer of operations of LIPA in his State of the State speech. Even though the governor appoints five of the nine trustees to serve on the LIPA Board, he cited LIPA's inability to quickly recover from Hurricane Sandy among other incidents. In May, he announced a plan to give PSEG day-to-day operations of LIPA's electric grid under a management contract. The Long Island Power Authority is the owner of the system and holder of its debt. On July 29, 2013 the state legislature passed a law implementing Governor Cuomo's plan. On January 1, 2014 PSEG rebranded the LIPA system \\"PSEG Long Island\\", effectively removing the LIPA name from the public eye. =2013 LIPA Reform Act= The 2013 LIPA Reform Act has been criticized by the New York State Comptroller for having contributed to a more expensive and less transparent retail electric service provider in LIPA. The comptroller noted that LIPA's debts have risen since its passage and in the case of transparency, noted that PSEG-LI requested three-quarters of rate case plan documents to be kept confidential, even with the New York State Public Service Commission's enhanced review power. The report from the comptroller's office also noted that the new New York State Public Service Commission's Long Island office is costing Long Island rate payers $8 million a year. A bill was introduced in 2016 that would enhance rate setting abilities by the New York State Public Service Commission. It would have also lifted a provision from state law that disallows LIPA from buying cheap hydroelectric energy directly from the New York Power Authority - see the Green Island Power Authority for comparison. A news article stated that the Governor's office was reviewing the bill.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) from 2005 to 2012. Early life and family McEntee was born in the village of Nobber in County Meath. He had seven siblings. His father Tony died in March 2011 at the age of 86, while his mother Madge outlived him. He became an active member of Fine Gael when he joined the party at the age of 15. Before being elected, he worked as a farmer and agricultural sales representative. He ran the \\"Dee Local Bar\\". McEntee was also very involved in the GAA, both as trainer and player (until an injury ended his promising career). He played at the back with Nobber, and won the 1983 Feis Cup, managed the Meath minor team during the 1990s, and led three clubs (Ballinlough, Syddan, and Castletown) to finals of the Meath Intermediate Football Championship, with two wins from the three. His brother Gerry is a renowned surgeon, who won the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship with Meath in 1987 and 1988. Another brother, Andy went on to manage Meath, while Andy's son Shane also played for Meath, both after the death of their brother and uncle respectively. He was married with two daughters and a son. His daughter Helen succeeded him as TD for Meath East after his death. Politics A close friend of Taoiseach Enda Kenny, McEntee's election candidacy began in 2004 when he was selected as the Fine Gael candidate in the Meath by-election, which was triggered by the resignation from D√°il √âireann of Fine Gael's former leader, John Bruton. Polling was on 11 March 2005, and McEntee narrowly beat the Fianna F√°il candidate Shane Cassells, and was elected to the 29th D√°il. McEntee was re- elected at the 2007 and 2011 general elections. He was the Fine Gael deputy spokesperson on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with special responsibility for Food and Fisheries from 2007 to 2011. On 10 March 2011, he was appointed as the Minister of State for Food, Horticulture and Food Safety. McEntee was also a successful campaigner on behalf of families in counties Dublin, Meath and Kildare whose homes had been damaged by pyrite in stone used in the foundations. McEntee gave an impassioned speech in defence of party leader Enda Kenny during the 2010 Fine Gael leadership challenge. Death McEntee died by suicide on 21 December 2012, two days after his 56th birthday. McEntee had been feeling under pressure because of criticism of a number of Government budgetary decisions. His funeral took place on 24 December 2012. The by- election for his seat was held on 27 March 2013, and was won by his daughter Helen.

In January 1940, she traveled to Mexico to see the exiled Russian Revolutionary Leon Trotsky and his wife Natalia Sedova. There, at the house of Trotsky in Coyoac√°n, Reed met the American Trotskyist leader James P. Cannon, leader of the Socialist Workers Party (United States). Reed joined in the same year, and remained a leading party member until her death. An active participant in the Women's liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s, Reed was a founding member of the Women's National Abortion Action Coalition in 1971. During these years she spoke and debated on women's rights in cities throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Ireland, the United Kingdom and France. Inspired by the works on women and the family by Friedrich Engels and Alexandra Kollontai, Reed is the author of many books on Marxist feminism and the origin of the oppression of women and the fight for their emancipation. Some of the most notable works by Reed are: Problems of Women's Liberation, Woman's Evolution: From Matriarchal Clan to Patriarchal Family, Is Biology Woman's Destiny?, and Cosmetics, Fashions, and the Exploitation of Women (with Joseph Hansen and Mary-Alice Waters.) She was nominated as a candidate for President of the United States for the Socialist Workers Party in the 1972 United States presidential election.

The organisation was founded as the Church of England Protection Society on 12 May 1859 to challenge the authority of the English civil courts to determine questions of doctrine. It changed its name to the English Church Union in May 1860. In particular, it was active in defending Anglo-Catholic priests such as Arthur Tooth, Sidney Faithorn Green and Richard William Enraght against legal action brought under the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874. This passing of this law was secured by Archbishop of Canterbury Archibald Campbell Tait to restrict the growing Oxford Movement and had the support of the then prime minister Benjamin Disraeli. One of the most famous attempts at prosecution under the 1874 act began in 1888. It was aimed against Edward King (bishop of Lincoln), but the Archbishop of Canterbury Edward Benson (bishop) revived his own archiepiscopal court (inactive since 1699) to avoid the prosecution of the saintly King in a lay court.Owen Chadwick, The Victorian Church (Part II), Adam & Charles Black: place, 1980, p.354. Such prosecutions ended in 1906 after a Royal Commission recognized pluralism in worship, but the act was not repealed until the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Measure 1963. In 1933 the English Church Union merged with the Anglo-Catholic Congress to form the present organisation.

It was adapted from the 1947 novel of the same name by Anthony Thorne. Origin The general plot derives from what appears to be a 19th-century urban legend, known variously as \\"The Vanishing Hotel Room\\" or \\"The Vanishing Lady\\", which has inspired several fictional works. The first published version of the story was written by Nancy Vincent McClelland as ‚ÄúA Mystery of the Paris Exposition‚Äù in The Philadelphia Inquirer dated November 14, 1897. It next appeared in the Detroit Free Press in 1898 as ‚ÄúPorch Tales: The Disappearance of Mrs. Kneeb,‚Äù by Kenneth Herford. The German author Anselma Heine's novel Die Erscheinung (1912) covers the same idea, and it was filmed as a segment called 'The Apparition\\" in Unheimliche Geschichten (Uncanny stores) (1919, remake 1932). Belloc Lowndes‚Äô 1913 novel The End of Her Honeymoon also contains the tale, as does Lawrence Rising‚Äôs 1920 She Who Was Helena Cass, Sir Basil Thomson‚Äôs 1925 The Vanishing Of Mrs. Fraser, and Ernest Hemingway‚Äôs 1926 The Torrent Of Spring.The Vanishing Hotel Room on Urban Legends Reference Pages (snopes.com) The German film Covered Tracks (1938) was based on the story, with a script by Thea von Harbou, and portions of the idea also featured in Alfred Hitchcock's 1938 film The Lady Vanishes The radio play \\"Cabin B-13\\" by John Dickson Carr tells a similar story. It aired three times in the series Suspense (twice in 1943 and once in 1949), and gave rise its own short-lived mystery radio series, Cabin B-13, after which it was adapted for television as \\"Cabin B-13\\" in the series Climax! (1958). It was then filmed as the theatrical release Dangerous Crossing (1953) and as the television movie Treacherous Crossing (1992). On television, both the episode \\"Into Thin Air\\" (1955) of the anthology-series Alfred Hitchcock Presents and the episode \\"The Disappearance\\" (1967) of the TV-series The Big Valley were based on the same tale. Later followed \\"Maybe You Will Remember\\", a variation told in Alvin Schwartz's book Scary Stories 3 (1991). The film's title derives from the nursery rhyme Oh Dear! What Can the Matter Be?. Plot In 1889, young Englishwoman Vicky Barton (Simmons) and her brother Johnny (David Tomlinson) arrive in Paris to see the Exposition Universelle. This is Vicky's first time in Paris, and after checking into a hotel, she drags her tired brother to dinner and the famous Moulin Rouge. She finally retires for the night, while Johnny has a late-night drink. When English painter George Hathaway (Bogarde) drops off his girlfriend, Rhoda O'Donovan (Honor Blackman), and her mother (Betty Warren) at the hotel, he asks Johnny for change for a 100 franc note to pay a carriage driver; Johnny lends him 50 francs and gives him his name and room number. The next morning, Vicky finds a blank wall where Johnny's room used to be. When she questions hotel owner and manager Madame Herv√© (Cathleen Nesbitt), the latter claims she arrived alone. The room number now adorns the common bathroom. Madame Herv√©'s brother Narcisse (Marcel Pontin) and the day porter (Eugene Deckers) back up her story. Frantic, Vicky goes to see the British consul (Felix Aylmer), followed secretly by Narcisse. She has no proof of her brother's existence, so the consul can only suggest she find a witness, Nina (Zena Marshall), the hotel maid who attended her. Nina had informed her that she was going up in a balloon with her boyfriend at the Exposition that day, so the consul takes her there. Tragically, she is too late. Before she can talk to Nina, the balloon ascends, bursts into flames, and plummets to the ground, killing the two passengers. Vicky tries the French police commissaire (Austin Trevor). He questions Madame Herv√© and her brother, but can find nothing amiss in their story. Since her room has been reserved for only two nights, Vicky has to leave the hotel. Madame Herv√© offers her a ticket home to England, which she is forced to accept, as she has little money left. However, unbeknownst to either party, Rhoda O'Donovan has been asked by George Hathaway to deliver a letter containing his loan repayment to Johnny. Not finding his room, Rhoda slips the envelope under Vicky's door, where she finds it. Vicky goes to see George. When he confirms having met her brother, she bursts into tears. He offers his assistance. George notices there are six balconies, but only five rooms on the floor, and finds the missing hotel room, the entrance having been covered over to be part of the wall. Under questioning by the police, Madame Herv√© reveals where Johnny has been taken. It turns out that he became sick with the Black Plague during the night. The news would have been disastrous for the Exposition, so he was secretly taken away to a hospital. George brings along Doctor Hart (Andr√© Morell), who tells Vicky her brother has a chance of living.

Background Carter was born 28 January 1953 in Islington, North London and educated at Friern Barnet Grammar School.Wreckers of Civilisation: The Story of Coum Transmissions and Throbbing Gristle, by Simon Ford He began his career in the late 1960s working for various UK TV stations (Thames, Granada and LWT) as a sound engineer on numerous TV shows and documentaries. This gave him an invaluable grounding in audio techniques and theories. He also found himself getting more involved in the visual side of entertainment, which eventually progressed into designing and presenting light shows and visual effects for numerous festivals, events and gigs, including for bands as diverse as Yes and Hawkwind. This led to commissions for the BBC Television shows Colour Me Pop and The Old Grey Whistle Test. By the early 1970s Carter was touring universities and colleges with a solo multimedia show, playing self-built synthesizers and keyboards and incorporating myriad lighting effects learned from his previous work. During this time he also worked extensively with visual artist John Lacey on many 8 mm & 16 mm experimental films and multimedia presentations. In the mid-1970s, through his connection with Lacey, Carter began an experimental music/sound collaboration with Cosey Fanni Tutti and Genesis P-Orridge, who were also working at the time as performance art group COUM Transmissions along with Peter Christopherson. The results of this musical collaboration were the creation of the group Throbbing Gristle, of the music label Industrial Records, and the birth of the 'Industrial Music' genre. In 1976 Carter also worked at the London bureau of the ABC News agency as a sound engineer and during that time designed and constructed their London radio studio. In 1977 he was offered a contract to build another ABC studio in Rome but turned it down to continue his involvement as a member of Throbbing Gristle. During the early years of Throbbing Gristle, the four members each continued with other solo projects and work. It was during this period (1980) when Carter recorded his first solo album for Industrial Records called The Space Between, which is now available on Mute Records. Shortly after the demise of Throbbing Gristle in 1981, and with help and backing from Rough Trade Records, Carter and Cosey Fanni Tutti formed their Conspiracy International (CTI) record label, and began working together as Chris & Cosey and CTI. Initially they released only music, but soon moved into producing video works, and with the help of Doublevision released a number of CTI experimental video films and soundtracks. In 1985 Carter released his second solo album Mondo Beat. As well as successfully touring all over the world, Chris & Cosey also recorded and collaborated on innumerable releases, most notably with Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart, Robert Wyatt, Coil, Boyd Rice, Lustmord, Monte Cazazza and many more. Chris & Cosey and Carter Tutti have also remixed tracks for Mortal Loom and Erasure, Pantaleimon, Throbbing Gristle, John Cage, Current 93 and Chris Ewan (FBH). In 1994 Carter also moved into journalism, and regularly has technical articles and reviews published in the magazine Sound on Sound. He is additionally a keen photographer and graphic designer, and in collaboration with Cosey Fanni Tutti has designed and produced numerous album covers, posters and art works. Carter returned to solo performance work in 1995 after a gap of 15 years. His performances included subtle references to his earlier works, but with obvious influences from his more recent collaborations. In 1998 Carter released a compilation CD entitled Disobedient, consisting of tracks from his 1995 Disobey tour (produced by Paul Smith). In 2000 he released a solo studio album, Small Moon. In 1998 the album Caged, a collaboration with electronic musician Ian Boddy, was released on the DiN label. In 2000 Carter, in collaboration with Cosey Fanni Tutti, began producing and releasing a series of albums titled: Electronic Ambient Remixes. The first of these, EAR ONE, consisted of dark ambient remixes of his 1980 The Space Between album. In 2002 he released EAR THREE, a further solo ambient CD, which consists of radical remixes of original Throbbing Gristle industrial rhythm tracks. In 2003 Carter and Cosey Fanni Tutti stopped releasing material and performing as Chris & Cosey, and began producing all their work under the title of Carter Tutti. One of their first appearances as Carter Tutti was a special quadraphonic performance in the Disney Theatre at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles in 2005. Carter and the other original members of Throbbing Gristle regrouped the band in 2003 and released the TG24 CD boxed set, with an accompanying art exhibition in London. TG performances followed in London, Camber Sands, Turin, Berlin, Barcelona and Paris. During 2007 Carter and Cosey Fanni Tutti again worked on numerous Throbbing Gristle projects, recordings, installations, exhibitions and performances. These included their groundbreaking audio/visual performance at Tate Modern turbine hall and their three-day 'public recording session' at the ICA in London. Carter worked on a Carter Tutti album entitled Feral Vapours of the Silver Ether, which is released in 2007 on the Conspiracy International label. Carter continues to work and collaborate with both Cosey Fanni Tutti and Throbbing Gristle. He is also working on a solo experimental audio project titled CCCL, and produced a new Carter Tutti film, released on DVD in 2008. Inventions Carter has invented a sound generator called The Dirty Carter Experimental Sound Generating Instrument‚Äîa circuit bending device with a tilt sensor.

It has no permanent residents. History West Quincy was platted in 1874, and named for its location west of Quincy, Illinois. It is the location of the Lock and Dam No. 21 Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. West Quincy is directly across the Mississippi River from Quincy, Illinois and once housed a Chicago, Burlington & Quincy train station, drive-in theater, and corporation. However, since the Great Flood of 1993, many businesses have left. The Knapheide corporation headquarters was formerly located in West Quincy, but it has relocated its main location to northern Quincy, Illinois. However, an active Knapheide facility still remains in West Quincy to this day. A tornado hit the drive-in theater and nearly crossed to Quincy but receded once it hit the bluffs. During the flood of 1993, the levee was sabotaged and water filled the floodplain, and a nearby barge was sucked into the break in the levee. It hit a local gas station and caused an explosion.Jehl, Douglas. Clinton Tours Floods and Considers Sending Troops. New York Times, 1993-07-18. Oil caught fire and the fire snaked across the water before it extinguished itself. All of the Quincy bridges‚Äîthe only links across the river from Missouri to Illinois for 200 miles‚Äîwere closed. One bridge, the Bayview Bridge, was closed for 71 days.Floods in Missouri Prevent Border Crossing for Miles. Weekend Edition, National Public Radio, 1993-07-17. This forced residents to drive to St. Louis or Burlington, Iowa, fly or take a ferry to get across the river. A man from the Illinois side of the river, James Scott, was convicted of causing the flood and was sentenced to life in prison. Today, West Quincy is home to a number of gas stations that largely serve consumers from Quincy. Missouri's lower state taxes on gasoline and cigarettes are the primary draw, as are the seasonal fireworks tents that spring up in the area during the summer. A number of other small businesses, including a pawn shop, a bank, and a number of car dealerships also operate in West Quincy.

The record is as of February 2011. It involves three- or four-wheeled electric vehicles, somewhat similar in overall appearance to a Go-Kart with an aerodynamic body, but powered by an electric motor and batteries. Electrathon class vehicles are principally defined and constrained by length and width (12 feet long and 4 feet wide or 3.6 m √ó 1.2 m maximum) and by battery weight and chemistry (, sealed lead acid). Discharged for one hour, this amounts to just under one kilowatt (1.3 hp). Driver's weight is ballasted to for fairness, and the vehicles themselves may weigh from . Safety regulations require features such as braking systems, roll bars, and electrical disconnects. Electrathon racing started in England, spread to Australia, and arrived in the United States in 1990. The basic format is to determine which car can travel the furthest in one hour within the limitations of battery weight and other factors mentioned above. Design teams must compromise speed in order to gain distance. Success requires efficiency of both the machine and driving technique. The relatively low cost of the electrathon racing has made the sport a popular activity for high school age students worldwide who learn skills related to design, problem-solving, teamwork, mathematics, physics, and electricity. Prizes are awarded for high school, college and open divisions, and there are separate classes for solar and advanced battery vehicles, but all generally race together under the same rules. Races are held on parking lots, road courses, and oval speedways, but size is a major factor, as cornering friction decreases efficiency. At present, the world record for distance travelled in one hour is , set in July 2009 on the oval at the Ford Michigan Proving Ground, by C. Michael Lewis. Using the USDOE conversion factors, this would be the equivalent of .

It used the same vehicle design rules, but instead of a 60 minute endurance event, it's a straight line top speed event on a one mile course. Speed was/is measured using a 30 foot trap at the end of the 1 mile distance.

After hydrogen fluoride, KF is the primary source of the fluoride ion for applications in manufacturing and in chemistry. It is an alkali halide and occurs naturally as the rare mineral carobbiite. Solutions of KF will etch glass due to the formation of soluble fluorosilicates, although HF is more effective. Preparation Potassium fluoride is prepared by dissolving potassium carbonate in hydrofluoric acid. Evaporation of the solution forms crystals of potassium bifluoride. The bifluoride on heating yields potassium fluoride: : K2CO3 \\\\+ 4HF ‚Üí 2KHF2 \\\\+ CO2‚Üë + H2O : KHF2 ‚Üí KF + HF‚Üë Platinum or heat resistant plastic containers are often used for these operations. Potassium chloride converts to KF upon treatment with hydrogen fluoride. In this way, potassium fluoride is recyclable. Applications in organic chemistry In organic chemistry, KF can be used for the conversion of chlorocarbons into fluorocarbons, via the Finkelstein (alkyl halides) and Halex reactions (aryl chlorides).. Such reactions usually employ polar solvents such as dimethyl formamide, ethylene glycol, and dimethyl sulfoxide.Han, Q.; Li, H-Y. \\"Potassium Fluoride\\" in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, 2001 John Wiley & Sons,New York.

He was a natural left- hander, though hit his serve with his right hand. Bromwich twice won the Australian Championships singles title, in 1939 (over Adrian Quist in a straight sets final) and in 1946 (a thrilling 5-set final victory over Dinny Pails). He was ranked World No. 3 by A. Wallis Myers in 1938 and again by Harry Hopman in 1947. Tennis career Although a fine singles player, Bromwich was primarily known as being a brilliant doubles player, winning 13 men's doubles titles and 4 mixed doubles titles in the majors. Tennis great (and near contemporary) Jack Kramer writes in his 1979 autobiography that if \\"Earth were playing in the all-time Universe Davis Cup, I'd play Budge and Vines in my singles, and Budge and Bromwich in the doubles. That's what I think of Johnny as a doubles player.\\" In the 1939 Davis Cup final, just as World War II was starting, Bromwich played arguably the match of his life in beating the American, Frank Parker, in straight sets, to clinch the Cup for Australia. Australia had trailed 0‚Äì2 after the first day, and came back to win the tie, 3‚Äì2. This remains the only time in Davis Cup history where the winning team has won a Davis Cup final after trailing 0‚Äì2. In 1948, Bromwich played the American Bob Falkenburg in the Wimbledon final, and had a championship point at 5‚Äì3 in the fifth set. He came to the net for a volley but decided that Falkenburg's ball would go long and let it go by. It landed on the baseline and Falkenburg fought his way back into the match. Bromwich later had another two championship points, but was unable to take those either, and Falkenburg came back to win the championship, taking the last four games to win the fifth set, 7‚Äì5. Kramer later wrote that \\"...it never seemed to me that he was the same player after that. He doubted himself. He was a precision player to start with ‚Äì he used a terribly light racket weighing less than twelve ounces, and it was strung loosely. He could put a ball on a dime, and I suppose after he misjudged that one shot, the most important in his life, he never possessed the confidence he needed.\\" Bromwich also had a championship point in losing the 1947 Australian Championships singles final to Dinny Pails. John Bromwich in a 1944 exhibition match against Dinny Pails Bromwich gained some revenge against Falkenburg in the 1949 Wimbledon quarterfinals, coming back from two sets down to win in five sets. Bromwich then lost to Jaroslav Drobn√Ω in the semifinals. Writing about Bromwich, Kramer says, \\"Bromwich was like McMillan today because as a kid John hit from both sides two-handed, and while he eventually had given up the two-handed forehand, he still hit backhand two-handed and could anything back from the baseline.

In a large body such as a planet, this train could be left to accelerate using just the force of gravity, since during the first half of the trip (from the point of departure until the middle), the downward pull towards the center of gravity would pull it towards the destination. During the second half of the trip, the acceleration would be in the opposite direction relative to the trajectory, but, ignoring the effects of friction, the speed acquired before would be exactly enough to overcome this deceleration, and as a result, the train's speed would reach zero at precisely the moment the train reached its destination. Origin of the concept In the 17th century, British scientist Robert Hooke presented the idea of an object accelerating inside a planet in a letter to Isaac Newton. A gravity train project was seriously presented to the Paris Academy of Sciences in the 19th century. The same idea was proposed, without calculation, by Lewis Carroll in 1893 in Sylvie and Bruno Concluded. The idea was rediscovered in the 1960s when physicist Paul Cooper published a paper in the American Journal of Physics suggesting that gravity trains be considered for a future transportation project.  Mathematical considerations  Under the assumption of a spherical planet with uniform density, and ignoring relativistic effects as well as friction, a gravity train has the following properties:Robin Davis: A Physicist's Pipe Dream * The duration of a trip depends only on the density of the planet and the gravitational constant, but not on the diameter of the planet. * The maximum speed is reached at the middle point of the trajectory. For gravity trains between points which are not the antipodes of each other, the following hold: * The shortest time tunnel through a homogeneous earth is a hypocycloid; in the special case of two antipodal points, the hypocycloid degenerates to a straight line. * All straight-line gravity trains on a given planet take exactly the same amount of time to complete a journey (that is, no matter where on the surface the two endpoints of its trajectory are located). On the planet Earth specifically, since a gravity train's movement is the projection of a very Low Earth Orbit satellite's movement onto a line, it has the following parameters: * The travel time equals 2530.30 seconds (nearly 42.2 minutes, half the period of a Low Earth Orbit satellite), assuming Earth were a perfect sphere of uniform density. * By taking into account the realistic density distribution inside the Earth, as known from the Preliminary Reference Earth Model, the expected fall-through time is reduced from 42 to 38 minutes. * For a train that goes directly through the center of the Earth, the maximum speed is equivalent to Earth's first cosmic velocity, also known as its orbital velocity ‚Å†‚Äî ‚Å†that which will bring a rocket or other projectile into orbit around Earth (a slower projectile falling back to Earth, a faster one escaping Earth's gravity altogether) ‚Å†‚Äî ‚Å†about 7,900 meters per second (28,440 km/h), equivalent to Mach 23.2 at sea level and standard temperature. To put some numbers in perspective, the deepest current bore hole is the Kola Superdeep Borehole with a true depth of 12,262 meters; covering the distance between London and Paris (350 km) via a hypocycloidical path would require the creation of a hole 111,408 metres deep. Not only is such a depth 9 times as great, but it would also necessitate a tunnel that passes through the Earth's mantle. Mathematical derivation Using the approximations that the Earth is perfectly spherical and of uniform density \\\\rho, and the fact that within a uniform hollow sphere there is no gravity, the gravitational acceleration a experienced by a body within the Earth is proportional to the ratio of the distance from the center r to the Earth's radius R. This is because underground at distance r from the center is like being on the surface of a planet of radius r, within a hollow sphere which contributes nothing. :a = \\\\frac{GM}{r^2} = \\\\frac{G\\\\rho V}{r^2} = \\\\frac{G\\\\rho\\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi\\\\,r^3}{r^2} = G\\\\rho \\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi\\\\,r On the surface, r = R, so the gravitational acceleration is g = G\\\\rho \\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi\\\\,R . Hence, the gravitational acceleration at r is :a = \\\\frac{r}{R}\\\\,g =Diametric path to antipodes= In the case of a straight line through the center of the Earth, the acceleration of the body is equal to that of gravity: it is falling freely straight down. We start falling the surface, so at time t (treating acceleration and velocity as positive downwards): :r_t = R - \\\\int_0^t v_t \\\\,dt = R - \\\\int_0^t\\\\int_0^t a_t\\\\,dt\\\\,dt Differentiating twice: :\\\\frac{d^2r}{dt^2} = -a_t = -\\\\frac{r}{R}\\\\,g = -\\\\omega^2\\\\,r where \\\\omega = \\\\sqrt\\\\frac{g}{R}. This class of problems, where there is a restoring force proportional to the displacement away from zero, has general solutions of the form r = k \\\\cos(\\\\omega t + \\\\varphi), and describes simple harmonic motion such as in a spring or pendulum. In this case r_t = R \\\\cos \\\\sqrt\\\\frac{g}{R}\\\\,t so that r_0 = R, we begin at the surface at time zero, and oscillate back and forth forever. The travel time to the antipodes is half of one cycle of this oscillator, that is the time for the argument to \\\\cos \\\\sqrt\\\\frac{g}{R}\\\\,t to sweep out {\\\\pi} radians. Using simple approximations of g = 10\\\\text{ m}/\\\\text{s}^2, R = 6500\\\\text{ km} that time is : T = \\\\frac \\\\pi \\\\omega = \\\\frac \\\\pi {\\\\sqrt\\\\frac{g}{R}} \\\\approx \\\\frac{3.1415926}{\\\\sqrt\\\\frac{10}{6500000}} \\\\approx 2532 \\\\text{ s} =Straight path between two arbitrary points= Path of gravity train For the more general case of the straight line path between any two points on the surface of a sphere we calculate the acceleration of the body as it moves frictionlessly along its straight path. The body travels along AOB, O being the midpoint of the path, and the closest point to the center of the Earth on this path. At distance r along this path, the force of gravity depends on distance x to the center of the Earth as above. Using the shorthand b = R \\\\sin \\\\theta for length OC: :g_r = \\\\frac{x}{R}\\\\,g = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{r^2+b^2}}{R}\\\\,g The resulting acceleration on the body, because is it on a frictionless inclined surface, is g_r \\\\cos \\\\varphi: Diagram of forces on a gravity train on non- diametrical straight line path :a_r = g_r \\\\cos \\\\varphi = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{r^2+b^2}}{R}\\\\,g \\\\cos \\\\varphi But \\\\cos \\\\varphi is r/x = \\\\frac{r}{\\\\sqrt{r^2+b^2}}, so substituting: :a_r = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{r^2+b^2}}{R}\\\\,g\\\\,\\\\frac{r}{\\\\sqrt{r^2+b^2}} = \\\\frac{r}{R} \\\\, g which is exactly the same for this new r, distance along AOB away from O, as for the r in the diametric case along ACD. So the remaining analysis is the same, accommodating the initial condition that the maximal r is R \\\\cos \\\\theta = AO the complete equation of motion is : r_t = R \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\cos \\\\sqrt\\\\frac{g}{R}\\\\,t The time constant \\\\omega = \\\\sqrt\\\\frac{g}{R} is the same as in the diametric case so the journey time is still 42 minutes; it's just that all the distances and speeds are scaled by the constant \\\\cos \\\\theta. =Dependence on radius of planet= The time constant \\\\omega depends only on \\\\frac{g}{R} so if we expand that we get : \\\\frac{g}{R} = \\\\frac{GM/R^2}{R} = \\\\frac{GM}{R^3} = \\\\frac{G\\\\rho\\\\,V}{R^3} = \\\\frac{G\\\\rho\\\\,\\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi\\\\,R^3}{R^3} = G\\\\rho\\\\,\\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi which depends only on the gravitational constant and \\\\rho the density of the planet. The size of the planet is immaterial; the journey time is the same if the density is the same. In fiction The 1914 book Tik-Tok of Oz has a tube, that passed from Oz, through the center of the earth, emerging in the country of the Great Jinjin, Tittiti-Hoochoo. In the 2012 movie Total Recall, a gravity train called \\"The Fall\\" goes through the center of the Earth to commute between Western Europe and Australia. In the video game Super Mario Galaxy, there are various planets with holes that Mario can jump through to illustrate the gravity train effect.

The original family name was \\"Feld\\", which is German for \\"field\\". It was changed to Field to Americanize his last name. His parents emigrated to America in 1909; his extended family that remained in Europe perished during the Holocaust. Field returned on assignment from WCBS to search for remnants of his family and produced a one-hour special Journey of the Heart, which included an emotional interview with Eli Wiesel. He was a first lieutenant and meteorologist with the 8th Air Force during World War II in the European Theater. His meteorological training was at Brown University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Field holds a B.A. in geology from Brooklyn College, a B.S. in optometry from Columbia University, and an O.D. degree from the Massachusetts College of Optometry. He was on the faculty of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Department of Preventive and Environmental Medicine. Field began his career in 1958 at WRCA-TV - which became WNBC-TV in 1960 - remaining there for over 25 years. He was friends with Johnny Carson and was a frequent guest on The Tonight Show. On August 12, 1984, Field moved to rival WCBS-TV, where he worked for 11 years. Later, he moved to WNYW-TV for two years before ending his weather forecaster career at WWOR-TV. Field was noted for his science reports on new technology and medicines. In the 1970s and 1980s, he hosted a nationally syndicated program on health originating from WNBC, called Health Field, and anchored a similar health news program on WLNY for the North Shore Long Island Jewish Health System, called Medical Update.http://www.northshorelij.com/NSLIJ/Medical+Update+TV He also did a documentary called Plan To Get Out Alive where he used a simulated house fire to show viewers how to survive that catastrophe. He won a local Emmy Award for his work. Dr. Field has now been replaced from Medical Update to retire in Florida. Family Field's son, Storm Field (b. 1948) was a meteorologist as well, following his father into weather forecasting. Storm Field joined WABC- TV in 1976 and became the station's chief weather forecaster shortly thereafter, staying on until 1991. Storm would join his father at WCBS the next year, with a humorous ad campaign employed by the station using puns and plays on both Frank and Storm Field's names. Storm Field eventually took over the chief meteorologist's role that his father held before him. He left in 1997 to become chief meteorologist at WWOR-TV where he again got a chance to work with his father. Storm Field presented a special in 2003 that highlighted his father's career. Field's daughter, Allison, was a meteorologist for WCBS- TV. She also appeared in a few movies, playing reporters or newscasters.

However, a stay is sometimes used as a device to postpone proceedings indefinitely. United Kingdom In civil procedure, stays of proceedings are governed by the Civil Procedure Rules. In criminal trials, they are governed by the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985., ss 22(4), 22A, 22B =Scope of power to order= Court have the power to stay: * the whole or part of any part of litigation before it * litigation permanently or temporarily * the proceedings pending some contingent event, such as conclusion of an appeal or a period allowed for mediation. =Inherent power= UK courts also maintain an inherent jurisdiction to manage legal proceedings before them,China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation v Emerald Energy Resources Ltd [2018 EWHC 1503 (Comm) (22 June 2018), para 61] but it is rarely exercised. Stays of proceedings are usually made under case management powers,CPR 3.1(2)(f) and may be ordered upon the application by one of the parties or by the court's own motion (the latter being infrequent). A court may issue a stay in a winding-up upon the creation of an application for rescission, an order being made against a false or mistaken institution, the petition debt being paid in full, the pertaining institution ceasing to exist, or the prior existence of a winding-up order.\\"Stay of Proceedings \\". Insolvency.gov.uk In bankruptcy, a case can be stayed if a certification for annulment exists or an individual voluntary arrangement is being negotiated. When the parties agree to terms of settlement while litigation is on foot, they may file a Tomlin order to stay the proceedings. Once approved by the court, the proceedings are permanently stayed pending an application by one of the parties to enforce the terms of the settlement agreement. =Lifting of stays= When a stay of proceedings is lifted, the proceedings continue. Allowances are made for interference of the stay with any case management directions (which specify dates which the parties must take steps in the action), so that parties are not time prejudiced by the making or interference caused by the stay. =Examples of stays= In R v.

As part of the Conservative government's fiscal austerity policy, the Ministry of Justice decided to cut the fees paid to barristers for Very High Cost Cases (VHCC) by 30% in November 2013. Due to the amount of papers involved this case was classed as a VHCC by the Legal Aid Authority (LAA) who pay the defendant's costs (as free representation (legal aid) is required under the European Convention on Human Rights). Barristers in protest of the cuts refused the instructions to act on behalf of the defendants at the reduced fees, so no suitably qualified barristers could be found to represent the defendants. As the defendants would not be able to have a fair trial without suitable representation (in breach of their right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights) the case could not proceed and was stayed. An adjournment was found to be unlikely to resolve the case and excessive delay would contradict a further requirement of the ECHR (Article 6(1)) requiring timely handling of prosecution. =Stays of execution= Stays of execution have a similar effect in respect of execution of judgments. No step may be taken to enforce a judgment while a stay of execution remains in force. United States According to the legal code, a stay of proceedings can be issued in a case \\"brought in any of the courts of the United States upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration\\" when the ruling on the case is pending, can be stayed \\"until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement, providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration\\".Cornell Law- Title 9, Chapter 1,3 For example, in the 2010s, as federal and state judges struck down same-sex marriage bans across the country, many judges stayed the rulings during the appeals process. Although a state's ban was struck down, such as that of Louisiana, the stay prevented implementation of their ruling pending a higher court decision and so prevented same-sex couples from obtaining a marriage license.http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/09/louisiana_same- sex_marriage_ru.html See also * Continuance * Preliminary injunction * Subpoena ad testificandum * Subpoena duces tecum References Category:Civil procedure Category:Criminal procedure ","title":"Stay of proceedings"},{"id":"2199457","text":"Bemidji Airlines (Bemidji Aviation Services Inc) is an American airline based in Bemidji, Minnesota USA.

Development The aircraft was designed as a single-seater aerobatic sports plane that could also be used as a trainer for fighter pilots. Its chief designer was Jerzy Drzewiecki of the RWD design team at the DWL (Do≈õwiadczalne Warsztaty Lotnicze) aircraft factory. Its silhouette was similar to the RWD-8. The first prototype (registration SP-ALC), was flown in July 1933 by Drzewiecki. Its stability was not satisfactory, but after modifications, including lengthening of the fuselage, it turned out to be a successful design, completing state trials in 1935. In a mock dogfight with the PZL P.11c fighter, the RWD-10 kept on the P.11's tail. The first public aerobatics show of the RWD-10 took place during the Gordon Bennett Cup in ballooning on September 14‚Äì15, 1935 in Warsaw. In 1936, the LOPP paramilitary organization ordered 20 aircraft, the purchase funded by a public collection for aviation development. They were built in 1937 and then distributed among the Polish regional aero clubs - the largest number going to the Warsaw Aero Club. In 1938, another two were built. In total, approximately 22 serial RWD-10s were produced. Three aircraft crashed before the war, the rest were probably destroyed during the Invasion of Poland in 1939.

The forest comprises and has portions of both the Absaroka- Beartooth and Lee Metcalf Wilderness areas within its boundaries. Gallatin National Forest borders Yellowstone National Park on the north and northwest and is part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, a region which encompasses almost . The forest is named after Albert Gallatin (1761‚Äì1849), U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and scholar of Native American languages and cultures. In descending order of land area the forest is located in parts of Park, Gallatin, Sweet Grass, Madison, Carbon, and Meagher counties. Administration Since 2014, the Gallatin and Custer National Forests are managed together as the Custer‚ÄìGallatin National Forest with headquarters in Bozeman, Montana. There are local ranger district offices located in West Yellowstone, Livingston and Gardiner in Montana for Gallatin, and Ashland and Red Lodge in Montana, and in Camp Crook in South Dakota for Custer. Features Sign marking entry to Gallatin National Forest along Beartooth Highway (U.S. Route 212), July 2002 There are six separate mountain ranges within the forest including the Gallatin, Madison, Bridger, Crazy, Absaroka, and Beartooth Ranges. The Beartooth's are home to Granite Peak, which at , is the highest point in Montana and also in the forest. Quake Lake on the Madison River is the site of the 1959 earthquake and landslide which formed the lake. A separate section of the forest north of Livingston, Montana is located in the Crazy Mountains which rise over above the great plains to the east. The forest includes two wilderness areas, the Absaroka‚ÄìBeartooth () and the Lee Metcalf (). While the lower elevations are often covered in grasses and sagebrush, higher altitudes support Douglas fir, with several species of spruce, cottonwood and aspen being the dominant tree species. Of the of streams and rivers there are major tributaries of the Yellowstone River, which bisects the western and eastern sections of the forest running through Paradise Valley. The Gallatin and Madison Rivers, major tributaries of the Missouri River, also are found in the forest. The habitat supports over 300 wildlife species, including the grizzly bear, bald eagle, and peregrine falcon. Many western North American species are represented in this climax ecosystem including elk, mule deer, bison, moose, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, cougar, wolf packs and black bear. Various subspecies of trout are plentiful in the streams and they contribute to the forest being one of the preeminent fly fishing regions in the United States. Over of hiking trails are located in the forest providing access into wilderness areas and interlinking with trails in Yellowstone National Park. There are almost 40 vehicle accessible campgrounds scattered throughout the forest, numerous picnic areas and even cabins that can be rented for a nominal fee through the forest's district offices. West Yellowstone, Montana provides access both into the forest and to Yellowstone National Park and is a popular snowmobile center during the winter. Nighttime temperatures can be below freezing any time of the year and mosquitos in the late spring and early summer also pose problems. Summertime high temperatures average in the 70s Fahrenheit (21‚Äì26 ¬∞C) and the wintertime lows can drop below ‚àí40 degrees. Most of the precipitation falls in the form of snow with some places averaging over annually. Access the forest off Interstate 90 south on U.S. Highway 89 from Livingston, Montana to Gardiner, Montana or south on U.S. 191 from Bozeman, Montana to West Yellowstone. The forest headquarters is located in Bozeman.

He was born in March in the Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire. Tucker joined the BBC in 1937 to work in radio where he remained for several years before moving to TV work. In 1954 Tucker wrote and directed The Three Princes which featured future Doctor Who producer Barry Letts and actor Roger Delgado who later became well known for playing the Doctor's opponent The Master. In 1961 he wrote, produced and directed the historical serial Triton, which was remade in 1968. Tucker also wrote a sequel Pegasus for broadcast in 1969. Amongst his work, he was a driving force during the formative stages of Doctor Who in 1963, acting as a caretaker producer prior to the arrival of Verity Lambert. Tucker's friend, the actor and director Hugh David -- whom Tucker had actually approached about playing the leading role in the series -- later claimed in interviews that it was Tucker who had named the series Doctor Who, although Tucker himself credited Sydney Newman with this. Tucker was also the director originally assigned to the first serial, An Unearthly Child, and later it had been planned that Tucker would direct more of the programme's introductory season. However, these commitments did not work out, and ultimately he directed only The Gunfighters in 1966. During the last episode, The O.K. Corral, a dispute arose between Tucker and then producer Innes Lloyd over the editing of the episode, leading to Tucker requesting that his credit be excised. In 2013 the BBC commissioned a docudrama about the creation and early days of Doctor Who, called An Adventure in Space and Time, as part of the programme's fiftieth anniversary celebrations. Tucker appears as a character in the drama, played by actor Andrew Woodall.

Methoxsalen modifies the way skin cells receive the UVA radiation, allegedly clearing up the disease. The dosage comes in 10 mg tablets, which are taken in the amount of 30 mg 75 minutes before a PUVA (psoralen + UVA) light treatment. Levels of individual patient PUVA exposure were originally determined using the Fitzpatrick scale. The scale was developed after patients demonstrated symptoms of phototoxicity after oral ingestion of Methoxsalen followed by PUVA therapy. Chemically, methoxsalen belongs to a class of organic natural molecules known as furanocoumarins. They consist of coumarin annulated with furan. It can also be injected and used topically.  Natural sources  In 1947, methoxsalen was isolated (under the name \\"ammoidin\\") from the plant Ammi majus, bishop's weed. In 1970, Nielsen extracted 8-methoxypsoralen from four species of the genus Heracleum in the carrot family Apiaceae, Cited by Mitchell and Rook (1979). including Heracleum mantegazzianum and Heracleum sphondylium. An additional 32 species of the genus Heracleum were found to contain 5-methoxypsoralen (bergapten) or other furanocoumarins.  Biosynthesis  The biosynthetic pathway is a combination of the shikimate pathway, which produces umbelliferone, and the mevalonate pathway. = Synthesis of umbelliferone = Umbelliferone Umbelliferone is a phenylpropanoid and as such is synthesized from L-phenylalanine, which in turn is produced via the shikimate pathway. Phenylalanine is lysated into cinnamic acid, followed by hydroxylation by cinnamate 4-hydroxylase to yield 4-coumaric acid. The 4-coumaric acid is again hydroxylated by cinnamate/coumarate 2-hydroxylase to yield 2,4-dihydroxy-cinnamic acid (umbellic acid) followed by a bond rotation of the unsaturated bond adjacent to the carboxylic acid group. Finally an intramolecular attack from the hydroxyl group of C2' to the carboxylic acid group closes the ring and forms the lactone umbelliferone. = Synthesis of methoxsalen = Dimethylallyl pyrophosphate The biosynthetic route then continues with the activation of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), produced via the mevalonate pathway, to form a carbo-cation via the cleavage of the diphosphates. Once activated, the enzyme umbelliferone 6-prenyltransferase catalyzes a C-alkylation between DMAPP and umbelliferone at the activated position ortho to the phenol, yielding demethylsuberosin. This is then followed by a hydroxylation catalyzed by the enzyme marmesin synthase to yield marmesin. Another hydroxylation is catalyzed by psoralen synthase to yield psoralen. A third hydroxylation by the enzyme psoralen 8-monooxygenase yields xanthotoxol which is followed by a methylation via the enzyme xanthotoxol O-methyltransferase and S-adenosyl methionine to yield methoxsalen.  Risks and side effects  Patients with high blood pressure or a history of liver problems are at risk for inflammation and irreparable damage to both liver and skin. The eyes must be protected from UVA radiation. Side effects include nausea, headaches, dizziness, and in rare cases insomnia. Methoxsalen has also been classified as an IARC Group 1 carcinogen (known to cause cancer) but is only cancerous when combined with light - UVA radiation.  Cultural aspects  Author John Howard Griffin (1920‚Äì1980) used the chemical to darken his skin in order to investigate racial segregation in the American South. He wrote the book Black Like Me (1961) about his experiences.

Earning a living for his family in the post-war years he, and his brother Harold with three other musicians, formed a band that played to commuters outside London Bridge Station before winding their way along the streets in London to a location outside the Queen‚Äôs Hall Gardens venue. It was here that Heath‚Äôs professional career began as he was spotted on the street and asked to play with the Jack Hylton Band who had a residence there. He did not last long, not having the experience required, but it gave him the ambition to pursue a career as a professional musician.Alan Dell Interviews on Ted Heath 21st Anniversary Album 1920s His first real band gig was with an American band on tour in Europe ‚Äì the Southern Syncopated Orchestra ‚Äì which had an engagement in Vienna, Austria and needed a trombone player. The drummer for this band, Benny Payton, taught Heath all about Jazz and Swing. Heath had to pay his own way back from Austria when the band ran out of money. From 1925 to 1926 Heath played in the Kit Cat Club band led by American Al Starita. There he heard Bunny Berigan, Tommy Dorsey and Jimmy Dorsey and Paul Whiteman when they toured Europe. He next played with the Metro-Gnomes, a small band fronted by Hylton's then-wife Ennis Parkes. In the late 1920s, Heath again joined Hylton's larger stage band (also being present on a number of 12-inch \\"concert\\" recordings), staying until 1930. Around this time, he also began to play for a number of other dance orchestras. 1930s In 1928, he joined Bert Ambrose's orchestra at the Mayfair Hotel in London and played there until 1935 when he moved on to Sydney Lipton's orchestra at the Grosvenor House. Ambrose, a strict disciplinarian, taught Heath how to be a bandleader. It was during this time that Heath became the most prominent trombone player in Britain, renowned for his perfect tone. He kept playing on numerous recordings as a studio musician, although he concentrated his efforts on the Ambrose band after 1932. In September 1939 the war caused the immediate disbandment of the Sydney Lipton Band, which was on tour in Scotland at the time. Heath, his wife Moira and children went back to London. In late 1939, Heath joined Maurice Winnick's Dorchester Hotel band. During the late '30s and early '40s, Heath also played as a sideman on several Benny Carter sessions. 1940s In 1940, Heath joined Geraldo's orchestra and played numerous concerts and broadcasts during the war travelling to the Middle East to play to the Allied Forces based there. He often became one of the \\"boys\\" in Geraldo's vocal group, 'Three Boys and a Girl'. In 1941, Geraldo asked his band members to submit a favourite tune to include in their broadcasts. Heath had composed a song \\"That Lovely Weekend\\", after his wife had written him a poem on a rare weekend together amongst his war travels, and he set this to music. Heath suggested \\"That Lovely Weekend\\" to Geraldo and it was orchestrated, with Dorothy Carless on vocal, and was an immediate wartime hit. The royalties from this song and another composition \\"Gonna Love That Guy\\" allowed Heath to form his own band. Ted Heath and his music Heath was inspired by Glenn Miller and his Army Air Force Band and spoke with Miller at length about forming his own band when Miller toured Britain with the USAAF Orchestra. Heath admired the immaculate precision of the Miller ensemble and felt confident that he could emulate Miller‚Äôs success with his own orchestra. In 1944, Heath talked Douglas Lawrence, the Dance Music Organiser for the BBC's Variety Department, into supporting a new band with a broadcasting contract. Lawrence was sceptical as Heath wanted a much larger and more jazz orientated band than anyone had seen in Britain before. This band followed the American model, and featured 5 saxes, 4 trombones, 4 trumpets, piano, guitar, Bass and Drums. The new Ted Heath Band, originally organised as a British \\"All Star Band\\" playing only radio dates, was first heard on a BBC broadcast in 1944. In 1945, the BBC decreed that only permanent, touring bands could appear on radio. So Ted Heath and his Music was officially formed on D-Day, 1944. In late 1945, American bandleader Toots (Tutti) Camarata came to UK as musical director for the film London Town (1946) starring comedian Sid Field. This film was intended to be Britain's first attempt to emulate the American film musicals of studios such as MGM and Camarata commissioned Heath to provide his band as the nucleus for the film's orchestra. The film was not a success. Heath arranged a stint at the Winter Gardens at Blackpool in 1946, a Scandinavian tour, a fortnight at the London Casino with Lena Horne, and backed Ella Fitzgerald at the London Palladium. Huge popularity quickly followed and Heath's Band and his musicians were regular Poll Winners in the Melody Maker and the NME (New Musical Express) ‚Äì Britain‚Äôs leading music newspapers. Subsequently Heath was asked to perform at two Royal Command Performances in front of King George VI in 1948 and 1949. In 1947 Heath persuaded impresario Val Parnell, uncle of the band's star drummer Jack Parnell, to allow him to hire the London Palladium for alternating Sundays for his Sunday Night Swing Sessions. The band caused a sensation and eventually played 110 Sunday concerts, ending in August 1955, consolidating the band's popular appeal from the late 1940s. These concerts allowed the band to play much more in a jazz idiom than it could in ballrooms. In addition to the Palladium Sunday night concerts the band appeared regularly at the Hammersmith Palais and toured the UK on a weekly basis. At this time, the teenage Alma Cogan applied to work with Heath, who told her she was too young. Later he admitted that the missed opportunity was one of the biggest mistakes of his life. Dead Link @ 04-2015 1950s and US tour In April 1956 Heath arranged his first American tour. This was a reciprocal agreement between Heath and Stan Kenton, who would tour Britain at the same time as Heath toured the United States. The tour was a major negotiated agreement with the British Musicians' Union and the American Federation of Musicians, which broke a 20-year union deadlock. Heath contracted to play a tour that included Nat King Cole, June Christy and the Four Freshmen that consisted of 43 concerts in 30 cities (primarily the southern states) in 31 days (7,000 miles) climaxing in a Carnegie Hall concert on 1 May 1956.Ted Heath Carnegie Hall review, Billboard, 12 May 1956 At this performance, the band's instrument truck was delayed by bad weather. The instruments finally arrived just minutes before the curtain rose. The band had no time to warm up or rehearse. There were so many encore calls at the Carnegie Hall performance that Nat King Cole (who was backstage, but not on the bill) had to come out on stage and ask people to leave. During the tour, Nat King Cole was attacked on stage in Birmingham, Alabama by a group of white segregationists. Heath was so appalled he nearly cancelled the remainder of the tour but was persuaded by Cole to continue. They remained firm friends until Cole died in 1965 and collaborated musically on many occasions. Heath later successfully toured the US again and also toured Australia and Europe. The 1950s was the most popular period for Ted Heath and His Music during which a substantial repertoire of recordings were made. In 1958 nine albums were recorded. He became a household name throughout the UK, Europe, Australasia and the US. He won the New Musical Express Poll for Best Band/Orchestra each year from 1952 to 1961. Heath was asked to perform at a third Royal Command Performance for King George VI in 1951, and for Elizabeth II in 1954. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1959 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre. During this period, Heath and his band appeared in several more films (following London Town) including Dance Hall (1950); It‚Äôs a Wonderful World (1956) and Jazz Boat (1960). Professional relationships In addition to Cole, Heath established close personal and professional relationships with Woody Herman, Count Basie, Marlene Dietrich, Johnny Mathis and Tony Bennett. He worked with Sarah Vaughan,Leslie Gourse \\"Sassy: The Life of Sarah Vaughan\\" Ella FitzgeraldElla Fitzgerald: The Chuck Webb Years and Beyond\\" p. 93 Lena Horne; June Christy; Mel Torme; The Four Freshmen; Donna Hightower and others. His band members included Ronnie Scott, an early member of the band, the pianist Stan Tracey, trumpeters Kenny Baker, Eddie Blair, Duncan Campbell, sax players Don Rendell and Tommy Whittle, trombonists Don Lusher and Wally Smith, drummers Jack Parnell and Ronnie Verrell and double bass Johnny Hawksworth. The addition of singers Dickie Valentine, Lita Roza and Dennis Lotis in the '50s gave the band more teenage appeal. He commissioned scores from all the top arrangers of the era with more than 800 original arrangements as part of the band‚Äôs library.

He continued to commission a huge number of original scores and arrangements and some of his biggest US chart successes came during this time. He performed continuously and successfully until his health faltered in 1964 suffering a cerebral thrombosis on his 62nd birthday and collapsing on stage in Cardiff. Thereafter the band toured less, but continued to record several albums. Death, and continuation of band through the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s He died in 1969 at the age of 67, but the band re-formed after a Thames Television tribute broadcast in 1976 with the approval of the Heath family, and went on performing concerts. Initially some early 1970s recordings were recorded under the musical direction of Roland Shaw, Ralph Dollimore and Stan Reynolds, but thereafter all recordings were supervised by trombonist Don Lusher, who led the band for 25 years until 2000, with mostly original Heath alumni. The final concert in December 2000, was a sell out at London‚Äôs Royal Festival Hall, attended by most Heath personnel past and present and the Heath family. The band at that performance was made up almost entirely of players who had played under Ted Heath's leadership. Numerous radio and television tributes have been broadcast over the years. The band compared favourably with the best of America‚Äôs big bands in the opinion of Count Basie in his testimonial to Heath on Heath‚Äôs 21st Anniversary album, and is generally accepted as the best swing band that Britain ever produced.Colin Larkin, \\"The Virgin Encyclopedia of Fifties Music\\" Personal life Heath was married twice, firstly in 1924 to Audrey Keymer who died in 1932. There were two sons from the marriage, Raymond and Robert. His second marriage was to Moira Tracey‚Äîa ballet dancer who appeared in one of the first television transmissions by John Logie Baird on the BBC, and became a prolific lyricist and songwriter. She received a special award for services to television, the 'Freedom of the City of London' in recognition of her services to songwriting and a British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors 'Gold Badge Award'. She died on 24 January 2000 in Weybridge, Surrey, England, UK. There were four children from this marriage, Martin, Valerie, Nicholas and Timothy. Two of Heath‚Äôs sons, Nick Heath and Tim Heath, continued the musical and entertainment tradition in the family by becoming successful artiste managers, record company and music publishing company owners, and Nick Heath continues his entertainment business career as a music producer and owner of Birdland Records. James Heath (Heath‚Äôs grandson‚ÄîNick Heath's son) is a film and music video director. Archives Leeds College of Music in Leeds, Yorkshire, United Kingdom has a wide collection of Ted Heath recordings and memorabilia available for research.

It is the fourth largest township in South Africa, after Soweto, Tembisa and Katlehong. Umlazi is the only township in the country that has its own registration plate, which is NUZ. It is divided into 26 sections, A through to Z, with the exception of I, O and X, but with an addition of AA, BB and CC. Etymology According to legend, the name Umlazi comes from \\"umlaza\\", the Zulu word for the sour acid produced from fermented or sour milk. It is believed that when King Shaka was passing through the area, he refused to drink from a local river claiming it had the taste of \\"umlaza\\". The area was called Umlazi after this incident. Infrastructure Umlazi, like many townships in the urban areas of Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Johannesburg, is witnessing increased private and government investments, as seen in the construction of new shopping complexes, primary and secondary schools, universities of technology and libraries. The new educational infrastructure is particularly important, as an affordable, easily accessible quality secondary education is valuable for many children in Umlazi, particularly with regards to their search for employment following school. Most young residents do not attend tertiary institutions due to their family's limited financial resources. Mangosuthu Highway is the most popular road in Umlazi and it links the residents to the many sections. There are now three shopping malls in Umlazi, the Mega-Philani Shopping Centre, Kwa-Mnyandu Shopping Centre and Umlazi Mega City Mall which is located just off the freeway that exits to Umlazi. The recently built KwaMnyandu Shopping Centre opened its doors on the 5th of June 2014. Almost all sections in Umlazi have a clinic and a police station. The King Zwelithini Stadium, which is located on the Mangosuthu Highway (Griffiths Mxenge Highway), has been revamped for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Education The township has two FET Colleges, Umlazi Coastal College V and BB Campuses, which are the equivalent of American Community Colleges, and a university, Mangosuthu University of Technology There are schools that produce 100% Matric (Grade 12) pass rate, including Ogwini Comprehensive Technical High School Umlazi Comprehensive Technical High School (ComTech), Menzi High School, Velabahleke High School and Zwelibanzi High School. About 30% of homes in Umlazi are informal settlements (tin and wooden shacks). Most of these informal settlements have been demolished and replaced with brand new homes and roads that are part of the Residential Development Project (RDP).

He was a member of Independent Fianna F√°il until he joined Fianna F√°il in 2006, he served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for Donegal North-East from 2002 to 2011. For personal reasons, he decided not to contest the 2011 general election. He had since contested a number of Seanad elections and attempted, but failed, to win a Fianna F√°il nomination in the Midlands‚ÄìNorth-West constituency for the 2019 European Parliament election. Early life Niall Blaney hails from a family with a long political history. His grandfather Neal Blaney, his uncle Neil Blaney, and his father Harry Blaney all preceded him as TDs. Niall Blaney was born in Letterkenny, County Donegal in 1974. He graduated from Letterkenny Institute of Technology with a diploma in civil engineering. He married Rosaleen in August 2002 and the couple had three children together. On 9 January 2011, at a political meeting at the Silver Tassie Hotel, Letterkenny, Blaney disclosed that he and his wife had agreed to an amicable separation and that he had moved out of the family home in Rosnakill, Fanad. Local and national politics Blaney first became involved in politics when he was elected to Donegal County Council in 1999. Three years later, in the 2002 general election, he won election to D√°il √âireann, capturing the third seat in the Donegal North-East constituency after Fianna F√°il's Jim McDaid and Cecilia Keaveney. Blaney started his political career as a member of Independent Fianna F√°il, a splinter group created by his uncle Neil T. Blaney when he was expelled from Fianna F√°il over the Arms Crisis of 1969‚Äì70. As a supporter of the Fianna F√°il‚Äìled coalition government upon his election to the D√°il, Blaney was widely anticipated to join Fianna F√°il and stand as a candidate for that party at the 2007 general election. Although some members of the Blaney family opposed the move, Niall Blaney announced on 26 July 2006 that he had joined the Fianna F√°il party, a move that marked the effective end of Independent Fianna F√°il. At the 2007 general election, Blaney again won the third seat in the constituency, after Fine Gael's Joe McHugh and Fianna F√°il's Jim McDaid. He was elected on the eighth count after a closely fought struggle with Sinn F√©in councillor P√°draig Mac Lochlainn. D√°il retirement and Seanad campaigns In a surprise statement on 30 January 2011, just hours before a Fianna F√°il selection convention for his constituency, Blaney announced that he would not be contesting the 2011 general election. He cited \\"personal reasons\\" for his decision. His retirement ended one of the longest family dynasties in Irish politics; a Blaney had served in the Oireachtas with only a few short breaks from 1927 to 2011. Blaney was an unsuccessful candidate for the Industrial and Commercial Panel of Seanad √âireann in the April 2016 election. He was also an unsuccessful candidate at the Seanad by-election in April 2018. The vacancy was caused by the resignation of Trevor √ì Clochartaigh of Sinn F√©in from the Agricultural Panel. The seat was won by former Fine Gael TD Anthony Lawlor. Blaney tried, but failed, to win a Fianna F√°il nomination in the Midlands‚ÄìNorth-West constituency for the 2019 European Parliament election. With the support of game shoot bodies regulator the National Association of Regional Game Councils (NARGC), Blaney was a candidate for the Agricultural Panel of Seanad √âireann in the March 2020 Seanad election. The move set him up against incumbent Senator Brian √ì Domhnaill (also with a history in Fianna F√°il). With only eleven seats available, √ì Domhnaill expressed surprise at Blaney's campaign, particularly as it was on a different panel than the one to which he sought admission in 2016. In March 2020, Blaney was elected to the Seanad, while √ì Domhnaill lost his seat. Following his involvement in the Oireachtas Golf Society Scandal (\\"Golfgate\\") in August 2020, Blaney was one of six senators who lost the party whip in the Senate as punishment for their actions.

It currently flies training and transport operations. The squadron was raised in February 1942 for service during World War II. Equipped with Lockheed Hudsons, the squadron was tasked with anti-submarine, anti- shipping operations, bombing and reconnaissance missions in New Guinea. In late 1942, the squadron was withdrawn to Sydney and re-equipped with Bristol Beauforts, which it operated along the east coast of Australia until the war ended. The squadron was disbanded in November 1945, but was re-formed in 1989 and currently operates King Air 350s.  History  = World War II = The squadron was established as a reconnaissance and bomber unit, equipped with Lockheed Hudson aircraft, at Port Moresby on 21 February 1942. It was formed from elements of other RAAF Hudson squadrons deployed from their home bases for combat operations against Japanese forces. No. 32 Squadron played an important role during the early stages of the New Guinea campaign, conducting anti-submarine and anti-shipping patrols, flying bombing sorties against enemy airfields and flying boat bases, as well as conducting reconnaissance and supply missions. No. 32 Squadron's first mission took place the day it was formed, when aircraft were launched to search for a reported enemy submarine. A few days later, the squadron undertook the first of many bombing raids on the Japanese air base at Gasmata. After only a few weeks of operations, due to enemy raids on Port Moresby's Seven Mile airfield, the squadron was withdrawn to Horn Island, Queensland, but continued to stage out of Seven Mile on its missions, its aircraft refuelling there en route to their targets. In March 1942, one of the squadron's Hudsons was the first to spot the Japanese convoy transporting the forces for the invasion of the New Guinea mainland. Later the same month, the squadron engaged Japanese forces landing at Lae and Salamaua. In July 1942, No. 32 Squadron was active in the Gona area and during the lead- up to the Battle of Milne Bay.Wilson, Stewart. Anson, Hudson & Sunderland in Australian Service. Aerospace Publications, Weston Creek ACT 1992. The skill and fighting spirit of a lone, outnumbered crew from No. 32 Squadron impressed Sabur≈ç Sakai, who would become among the highest-scoring Japanese aces of the war. Pilot Officer Warren Cowan, Pilot Officer David Taylor, Sergeant Russell Polack and Sergeant Lauri Sheard, in Hudson Mk IIIA A16‚Äì201 (bu. no. 41-36979), were killed in action after being shot down by Sakai on 22 July 1942. A16‚Äì201 was intercepted over Buna, New Guinea by nine Mitsubishi A6M \\"Zeroes\\" of the Tainan Kaigun K≈çk≈´tai, led by Sakai. The Hudson's crew surprised the Zero pilots by taking the initiative in a turning dogfight and were apparently unscathed for at least 10 minutes. Sakai observed that after he killed or wounded the Hudson's rear/upper gunner, the pilot became less able to evade his rounds. It caught fire and crashed in jungle near the coastal village of Popogo. So impressed were the Japanese pilots by their opponents that, many years after the war's end, Sakai asked Australian researchers to help him identify the pilot. In 1997, Sakai took the unusual step of writing to the Australian government, recommending that Cowan be \\"posthumously awarded your country's highest military decoration\\".The Commonwealth's highest military honour ‚Äì and the only decoration that can be awarded posthumously, has always been the Victoria Cross. The suggestion was rejected on the grounds that all such recommendations had been closed at the war's end. Redeployed to Sydney in September 1942, No. 32 Squadron conducted anti-submarine patrols, initially from RAAF Base Richmond and then from Camden. In March 1943, the Hudsons were replaced by DAP-built versions of the Bristol Beaufort, which it used until the end of the war. The squadron was disbanded in November 1945. = Reactivation = No. 32 Squadron was reformed on 1 July 1989 at RAAF Base East Sale as a training and transport squadron equipped with Hawker Siddeley HS 748 aircraft. In 1997, leased Beechcraft B200 Super King Airs joined the squadron, although it continued to operate some of the HS 748s as well. No. 32 Squadron was re-equipped with leased Beechcraft King Air 350 aircraft commencing in 2003 and the remaining HS 748s were retired on 30 June 2004. There are eight King Air 350s in service. The King Air 350s have been heavily modified and are used in three main roles: for Air Combat Officer and Maritime Aviation Warfare Officer; for low-level tactical and maritime operations training under the auspices of the School of Aviation Warfare; and as light transport aircraft. Typical low-level training missions are conducted at 200 to 500 feet (61 to 153 metres) above sea or ground level, while transport missions may be undertaken at altitudes as high as 35,000 ft (10,675 m). The current squadron motif is a sulphur-crested cockatoo with the Southern Cross depicted on a blue background. In May 2018, a King Air belonging to No. 32 Squadron deployed to the South Pacific for a two week rotation as part of the RAAF's support to Operation Solania. The operation is focused upon detecting illegal fishing and policing economic exclusion zones, and involves air and naval forces from Australia, New Zealand, the United States and France.

Origin of the name  According to local folklore, the term originates from an incident in which a monkey was hung in Hartlepool, England. During the Napoleonic Wars, a French ship of the type chasse mar√©e was wrecked in a storm off the coast of Hartlepool. The only survivor from the ship was a monkey, allegedly dressed in a French army uniform to provide amusement for the crew. On finding the monkey on the beach, some locals decided to hold an impromptu trial; since the monkey was unable to answer their questions and because they had seen neither a monkey nor a Frenchman before, they concluded that the monkey must be a French spy.Maconie, Stuart (2008), Pies and Prejudice: In search of the North, Ebury Press, (p. 300-301) Being found guilty, the animal was duly sentenced to death and was summarily hanged on the beach. An alternative theory is that it was a young boy who was hanged (the term \\"powder-monkey\\" was commonly used at the time for children employed on naval warships to prime the cannon with gunpowder). An earlier and remarkably similar monkey-hanging legend with a similar associated song refers to the inhabitants of Boddam, Aberdeenshire.Westwood, Jennifer and Kingshill, Sophia (2009), The Lore of Scotland: A guide to Scottish legends, Random House Books, (p. 302) With similar lyrics and scansion (\\"And the Boddamers hung the Monkey, O\\") it is plausible that Ned Corvan heard and adapted the song while travelling the Scottish Lowlands with Blind Willie Purvis. The story may also have its origins in the rivalry between Hartlepool (the small coastal village) and West Hartlepool (the growing industrial town based around the docks). The comic song may have been popular in one of the West Hartlepool's music halls, where the audience would have enjoyed poking fun at the Hartlepool ‚Äòyokels‚Äô who hanged the monkey. The Monkey Song The earliest evidenced mention of the hanging is from the popular song, written and performed by 19th century comic performer, Ned Corvan, \\"The Monkey Song\\". Given that \\"only after Corvan's appearances in Hartlepool is there any strong evidence for the development of the Monkey story\\", the song itself seems the most plausible origin for the myth. In popular culture Another monkey statue at Hartlepool Marina collects coins for charity. The local football club, Hartlepool United F.C., capitalised on their \\"Monkey Hangers\\" nickname by creating a mascot called \\"H'Angus the Monkey\\" in 1999. Two of the town's six rugby clubs use variations of the hanging monkey, Hartlepool Rovers crest being a beret wearing monkey hanging from a gibbet, while Hartlepool RFC neckties sport a rugby ball kicking monkey suspended from a rope. One wearer of the monkey suit, Stuart Drummond, unexpectedly became the first directly elected mayor of Hartlepool in 2002 while in the guise of H'Angus, but was forbidden from wearing the costume while in office. A statue of the monkey has been erected on the Headland; another at Hartlepool Marina (formerly in West Hartlepool) also serves to collect coins for a local hospice. Although some Hartlepool residents find the term \\"monkey hanger\\" insulting,Maconie 2008 (p. 301) a large number of residents have embraced the term and celebrate it as an important and unique characteristic of the town; as seen in the 2014 documentary Heart of the Pools. The French comic book Le Singe de Hartlepool by Wilfrid Lupano and J√©r√©mie Moreau published in 2012 tells this story. The Electric Six song \\"Unnatural Beauty\\" from their 2013 album Mustang makes reference to the term Monkey Hanger and its association with Hartlepool with the lyrics: In 2008, a novel based on the legend called The Hartlepool Monkey, written by Sean Longley, was published. The novel tells the story of the monkey, named Jacques LeSinge by the French doctor who discovers him, that was supposedly hanged. In the book, the monkey talks and possesses several other human characteristics. The Hartlepool Monkey also featured prominently in the play Bestiary, written by Jim Burke and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2003.Daoust, Phil, \\"Pick of the Day\\" The Guardian, 8 July 2003 In 2014, a documentary was made about the Hartlepool Monkey and its long-lasting significance to the city and its inhabitants called Heart of The Pools.Heart of The Pools A radio play by Ian Martin, The Hartlepool Spy, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Christmas Day 2018, with a cast including Michael Palin, Vic Reeves, Toby Jones, Gina McKee and Monica Dolan. The Hartlepool monkey is mentioned in Jonathan Coe's novel Middle England (published by Penguin Random House, 2018). The Northumbrian singer/songwriter Jez Lowe has a satirical song \\"The Simian Son\\" (originally known as \\"The Monkey's Revenge\\") that was performed first in 2012. In it, the grandson of the ill-fated monkey reveals the simian curse under which Hartlepool has been living since the hanging.

The incident occurred during the main event of Nitro, featuring WCW World Heavyweight Champion Kevin Nash, who was the leader of the Wolfpac faction of the New World Order (nWo), and Hollywood Hogan, the leader of the Hollywood faction of the nWo, with whom Nash and his group had been feuding since April 1998 when the original faction split up, and Hogan had retired from wrestling. The Wolfpac faction were babyfaces (heroes), while the Hollywood faction were heels (villains), as was the original nWo. The match saw Hogan poke Nash in the chest with his index finger, prompting Nash to theatrically throw himself onto the mat and allow Hogan to pin him; the victory marked the reunion of both nWo factions into one villainous group. During the same broadcast, WCW announcer Tony Schiavone gave away the results of their Monday Night Wars rival World Wrestling Federation's Raw Is War (which was taped six days earlier, and aired from tape at the same time Nitro was being aired live), revealing that wrestler Mick Foley (as Mankind) was set to win the WWF Championship. Although this revelation was meant to deter Nitro viewers from switching to Raw Is War, it instead reportedly prompted 600,000 viewers to change channels in order to see Foley's victory, with most viewers only tuning back in to Nitro when there were five minutes left in the broadcast. The incident was named \\"The Fingerpoke of Doom\\" both for Nash's deliberately over-selling the finger poke, and for the negative ramifications the incident had for the company as a whole, with some wrestling journalists crediting it as the beginning of WCW's ultimate downfall and loss of the Monday Night Wars.  Setup  The match was directly related to a controversial main event that occurred at Starrcade in December 1998, during which Kevin Nash pinned Goldberg to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. At the time of the match, Goldberg had been undefeated in his WCW career; and his defeat came about due to the interference of Nash's former tag team partner Scott Hall. The following evening, Nash professed dissatisfaction with Hall's interference, and offered Goldberg a rematch for the following episode of Nitro in Atlanta. However, Goldberg was kayfabe arrested halfway through the three-hour Nitro at the Georgia Dome and accused of \\"aggravated stalking\\" by Miss Elizabeth (Goldberg was originally to have been accused of rape, but refused to go along with that particular storyline). Although Goldberg was later released when Elizabeth could not keep her story straight, he would not make it back to the arena in time to compete against Nash; it was noted in The Death of WCW by R.D. Reynolds and Bryan Alvarez that the entire skit was proven to make no sense after it was revealed that the police station was across the street from the Georgia Dome.Reynolds, R.D.; Alvarez, Bryan. The Death of WCW, ECW Press, 200 Meanwhile, Hollywood Hogan showed up for the first time since declaring his retirement one month prior. Hogan and Nash had been in a feud since April 1998, when Nash became a fan favorite by breaking away from Hogan's nWo stable in order to form his own rival faction, nWo Wolfpac; Hogan remained a villain, leading his own nWo faction, nWo Hollywood. In Goldberg's absence, Nash offered the title shot to Hogan, who accepted the offer. Hogan came out to the ring accompanied by Scott Steiner, who had taken over the leadership role in nWo Hollywood. Nash came out next, then revealed a surprise to Hogan and the crowd by stopping at the end of the entrance ramp and pointing backwards. The surprise was Hall, who had been a part of nWo Hollywood for most of the last seven months and who entered wearing a Wolfpac T-shirt. This marked the reunion of The Outsiders, who had broken up as a tag team at Slamboree in May 1998.  Match  The match started with the two men circling each other. Nash tried intimidating Hogan by pushing him hard into the corner. In retaliation, Hogan then hinted at punching Nash only to poke him in the chest. Nash fell on his back in a theatrical manner, which has been compared to \\"getting hit in the chest with a cannonball\\". Hogan then covered him to get the pinfall and was declared the new WCW World Heavyweight Champion. After this occurred, Hall and Steiner entered the ring and celebrated with Nash and Hogan to signify the Wolfpac and Hollywood factions were reuniting again. As Hogan had done before each time he had won the title since August 1996, he spray-painted the belt's faceplate with \\"nWo\\". However, to signify the reunion with the Wolfpac, Hogan used red spray paint. Meanwhile, the dissatisfied crowd began pelting the ring with food and other debris. Goldberg then reentered the building and ran to the ring to attack the reunited nWo members. Wolfpac member Lex Luger followed him, appearing to assist him, but instead jumped Goldberg from behind and showed he was also part of the reunited nWo. Goldberg was handcuffed to the ropes, repeatedly shocked with a taser, and had \\"nWo 4 Life\\" painted in red and black paint all over his back. A loud \\"We want Sting!\\" chant erupted from the fans in the Georgia Dome, hoping that Sting would come to rescue Goldberg and even things up for WCW. However, Sting had been out since Bret Hart attacked him at Halloween Havoc in October and would not appear again until March 1999; by that time the nWo reunion story had largely petered out in favor of Ric Flair taking control of WCW, and most of the nWo members had been sidelined due to injuries.  Mankind incident  Airing opposite Nitro this night was the episode of Raw Is War in which Mick Foley (as Mankind) won the WWF Championship from The Rock. As per their procedures at the time, the WWF had taped this particular episode of Raw Is War six days in advance of the program's airing and even acknowledged the title change on their website immediately after the taping had concluded. Earlier that night, armed with knowledge of what happened, WCW announcer Tony Schiavone, who was acting on orders from Eric Bischoff, gave away the result of the match before it aired: Within minutes, as shown by Nielsen ratings, over half a million viewers switched channels from Nitro on TNT to Raw Is War on the USA Network. After the Steve Austin run-in, the title match finish, and the post-match celebration, many fans then switched back to Nitro, which still had five minutes of air time left. The final ratings for the night were 5.7 for Raw Is War and 5.0 for Nitro. The next week on Raw Is War, there were signs in the crowd that said: \\"Mick Foley put my butt in this seat\\".  Controversy In WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling, R.D. Reynolds says of the match, \\"That was that. Fans had been burned one time too many by WCW and the nWo. From that point on in 1999, ratings steadily dropped for the company\\". WWE refers to the match as \\"one of the most scandalous title changes of all time\\" and states that \\"shocking does not even adequately describe this moment\\". According to wrestling writers Brian Fritz and Christopher Murray, the event insulted fans, upset viewers, and alerted other wrestlers in the company of problems. They draw a direct link between the title change and the drop in ratings that took place in its aftermath. In The Death of WCW, Reynolds and Alvarez expand on this link, stating that the January 4 incident \\"more than any other, started the ball rolling towards the company's inevitable doom\\". They believe that the \\"now-legendary\\" event made the episode \\"the single most destructive Nitro in the history of the company\\" and call it a \\"disaster of epic proportions\\". The New York Daily News stated that the match \\"is widely considered the beginning of the end for WCW\\". In an interview with RF Video, Nash claimed that he had nothing to do with the booking of the incident. When discussing what RF Video refers to as \\"infamous one finger pin with Hogan\\", Nash said that Goldberg was the one who caused that rumor to be spread and that he had not begun booking until February 1999. In The Rise and Fall of WCW, Goldberg said that the incident was Hogan and Nash playing their own little games against the wrestling world. Furthermore, Reynolds and Alvarez contended in The Death of WCW that the actions of Hogan and Nash from the time Goldberg beat Hogan in Atlanta until their own match in the same venue six months later, including the match itself, were part of an ongoing plot between the two wrestlers. On the August 31, 2009 episode of Raw, Dusty Rhodes, Shawn Michaels, and Triple H were shown watching and discussing footage of the Hogan‚ÄìNash match backstage. In his autobiography, Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Hulk Hogan rejected the idea that the Fingerpoke of Doom was pivotal in WCW's fall. He claimed that \\"watering down the whole concept\\" of the New World Order by splitting the group and creating spinoffs such as the Latino World Order and an inability to compete with the WWF's more risqu√© \\"Attitude style\\" were more responsible for WCW's downfall. Eric Bischoff's autobiography Controversy Creates Ca$h includes a chapter entitled The Turning Point That Wasn't. In it, Bischoff claimed that singling out the Fingerpoke as the reason WCW went under to be an over-simplification. He did acknowledge that people switched from watching Nitro to Raw Is War after Schiavone's remark about Foley winning the WWF Championship, but claimed that \\"the tide had turned so significantly that us talking about one match didn't matter\\".

Production The series premiered on August 7, 1995, occupying Jugate Conmigo's former time-slot years before. Part of the Jugate cast, including Luciano Castro and Romina Yan herself, is featured in the show's first season. The series started in the traditional dramatic telenovela format, with an adult cast sharing space with the young cast on screen. This aspect changed gradually in the following years (starting with the third season, in 1997), with the young characters receiving more prominence in the storyline. Fantasy elements were also added to the plot. Actress Agustina Cherri had an exclusivity contract with Telefe and was cast as the young protagonist among the orphans, Mili Uri√©n. Romina Yan auditioned for the role of Bel√©n Fraga with few other actresses and was cast. The series is also known for being the first using the serialized format, unusual in the telenovela genre. Season One has 155 episodes; Seasons Two to Six have the very same number of episodes each year, in a total 210. As a consequence of the series's cancellation, the shortest season is the last one, with only nine episodes. Despite having a sudden ending, the seventh season features the return of Agustina Cherri as a 20-year-old Mili.http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2000/12/21/c-00201.htm Romina Yan left the series in 1998 (Season Four), and the storyline was rebooted in the following year, Chiquititas 1999 (Season Five), with new characters, a new story and setting, co-starring Grecia Colmenares and Marcela Kloosterboer. Although having different roles, some young actors from previous seasons remained (such as Guillermo Santa Cruz and Camila Bordonaba), which initially caused confusion on the audience. In 2000 (Season Six), the setting went back to the Rinc√≥n de Luz manor, where the series ended in 2001. Each season received a respective soundtrack with three additional albums, all of them released by Sony Music. The songs are without exception composed by Carlos Nilson and Cris Morena.http://edant.clarin.com/diario/1997/08/23/c-00801d.htm Actor, singer and musician Felipe Colombo was brought by Cris Morena from the Mexican version of the series, where he portrayed Julio. He was introduced in Season Five, alongside Luisana Lopilato. Camila Bordonaba was introduced in Season Two as Pato and Benjamin Rojas in Season Four. They were all cast in Rebelde Way, an Argentine hit television series also created and produced by Morena, in which they portrayed its protagonists and members of the band Erreway. =Stage presentations= Annual stage presentations at the Gran Rex theatre, written and directed by Cris Morenahttp://edant.clarin.com/diario/1998/12/28/c-00602d.htm complemented the series from the second year onwards, featuring the whole cast of each season. The fourth year holds to this day the record of most tickets ever sold by that theatre.http://edant.clarin.com/diario/1998/10/11/c-00601d.htm An incident occurred in the Season Five performances (Chiquititas 1999), in which a fire generated by short circuit destroyed part of the scenario, specifically the thematic giant tree. Gran Rex did not return the money to the present and frustrated audience. Between 1996 and 2000, 1.100.432 of Argentine people watched the Chiquititas presentations. =Cancellation= Chiquititas was canceled after financial disagreements between Cris Morena and Claudio Villarruel, Telefe's newly employed chairman. In the seventh and final season, the running was changed from daily to weekly, being aired at Sundays, and being replaced by a retrospective of Chiquititas previous seasons, entitled Chiquititas: la historia, which was aired daily on the original time slot (weekdays at 6 PM). Morena moved to Canal 9, for which she created Rinc√≥n de Luz, a new series with similar concept. The show had to be renamed since the title of Chiquititas contractually belonged to Telefe. Reception Chiquititas was panned by critics that deemed the program to be over sexualized and having a bad quality. The idea of an orphanage being portrayed as a beautiful place full of pretty well-dressed white children was also heavily panned. The Season Five ending, where the adult characters were removed from the storyline after an accident, and the children are sent to the Hogar de las Sombras child prison from where they escape, was considered by some reviewers as \\"anything but ingenious\\" and too \\"traumatic\\" for children, and received criticism for the writer's \\"incoherence and unjustified cruelty\\". Despite receiving bad reviews, the series became a hit among the young audience, and spawned 150 licensed products and a monthly magazine, La Revista de Chiquititas. The Season Three released soundtrack, La M√∫sica de Chiquititas Vol. 3, sold 2.500 copies, and the Season Four album is the top selling among the twelve volumes. Themes such as \\"Mentiritas\\", \\"Coraz√≥n con Agujeritos\\" and \\"Pimpollo\\" are the most remembered songs to this day.

Rinc√≥n de Luz Rinc√≥n de Luz is a 2003 series created by Cris Morena for Argentine channel Canal 9.

Starring the popular singer Soledad Pastorutti and Guido Kaczka (who had acted in Chiquititas first four seasons as Piojo, Bel√©n's brother), the show did not reach the amount of popularity the first version of the program achieved. However, it was extremely successful in Israel and the complete cast of the show visited Tel Aviv for a series of concerts at Nokia Arena. In 2001, while leaving Telefe, Cris Morena made it clear that, despite of legal rights, she would not stop producing Chiquititas, stating that it was \\"more than a title\\".

While Sunnis regard Umar ibn al-Khattab in high esteem and respect his place as one of the \\"Four Righteously Guided Caliphs\\", the Shia do not view him as a legitimate leader of the Ummah and believe that Umar and Abu Bakr conspired to usurp power from Ali. Shia believe that the Sunni view of Umar was created by the later Umayyad dynasty to honour the man that gave power to the first Umayyad ruler and third Sunni Caliph, Uthman. In this way, it gives legitimacy to Umar's consultation that started their own dynasty. Shia believe that the Umayyad view was propagated with lethal force and heavy duress and as time went on, that view became predominant and eventually taken as truth, cemented by the works of Bukhari. Shi'a Biography =Embracing Islam= A Sh'ia scholar states: =Hafsa= Hafsa, the daughter of Umar, was originally married to Khunais ibn Hudhaifa. When he died, Umar sought to find a husband for her. He approached his friend Uthman who said \\"I am of the opinion that I shall not marry at present\\", after thinking about the proposal for a few days. Umar became angry with Uthman and asked Abu Bakr the same thing. Abu Bakr did not give him a reply, causing Umar to become even more angry with him than he was with Uthman. Umar then preceded to Muhammad to discuss the previous two incidents. Muhammad reassured Umar by saying that \\"Hafsa will marry one better than Uthman will marry one better than Abu Bakr.\\" Umar was obviously alluding to the fact that Hafsa was to marry Muhammad and that Uthman was to marry a daughter of Muhammad.Bukhari 005.059.342 Hafsa was married to Muhammad in 625. Muhammad's household was not always peaceful as his wives were in two groups.Bukhari 003.047.755 Umar said on one occasion: :\\"Hafsa, the news has reached me that you cause Allah's Messenger trouble. You know that Allah's Messenger does not love you, and had I not been (your father) he would have divorced you.\\" (On hearing this) she wept bitterly.Sahih Muslim 009.3507 =Pen and paper= writes: =After Muhammad= Shia claim that the despair felt by Umar at the time of Muhammad's death was not genuine, they insist that there was no despair, only threats aimed to delay matters so that his friend and confederate Abu Bakr could return before Ali was confirmed as the successor. As for Ali's allegiance to Abu Bakr's rule, this too was made up to support Abu Bakr's claim to power.Did Imam Ali Give Allegiance to Abu Bakr?  Islamic InsightsIn the words of Imam Ali himself: Nahjul Balagha Letter 28 =Coup d'√©tat= writes: =Abu Bakr's era= Shi'a view Umar as the \\"khalifa-maker\\" of Abu Bakr and that during Abu Bakr's khilafat, Umar was his principal adviser.A Restatement of the History of Islam and Muslims on Al- Islam.org Ali is quoted saying: :\\"I watched the plundering of my inheritance till the first one [Abu Bakr] went his way but handed over the Caliphate to Ibn al-Khattab after himself.\\" (Then he quoted al-A'sha's verse):al-A\`sha's verse :\\"My days are now passed on the camel's back (in difficulty) while there were days [of ease] when I enjoyed the company of Jabir's brother Hayyan.\\" (Implying the contrast between the present and the time of Muhammad) :\\"It is strange that during his [Abu Bakr] lifetime he wished to be released from the caliphate but he confirmed it for the other one [Umar] after his death. No doubt these two shared its udders strictly among themselves\\".Nahj al-Balagha Sermon 3 =Umar's Caliphate= states: = Marriage to Umm Kulthum bint Ali = The majority of Shi'a's are in agreement that Umm Kulthum, the daughter of the Ali, was not married to Umar. One narration concerning the marriage is, Ali is further quoted in the same sermon: :\\"This one [Umar] put the Caliphate in a tough enclosure where the utterance was haughty and the touch was rough. Mistakes were in plenty and so also the excuses therefore. One in contact with it was like the rider of an unruly camel. If he pulled up its rein the very nostril would be slit, but if he let it loose he would be thrown. Consequently, by Allah people got involved in recklessness, wickedness, unsteadiness and deviation\\". =Death= It is recorded in some Shi'a texts that Ali said: writes: Views on the Shi'a view =Non-Muslim view= Edward Gibbon wrote: And he also writes that Ali...

Anderson was involved in a match fixing scandal that ended his career. In a game at Old Trafford on 29 December 1917 against Burnley, he was accused of fixing the match after three United players complained to the team president. He was then banned from Old Trafford on 8 January 1918 and later sentenced to eight months in prison after his trial in Liverpool. In 1915, Anderson had already testified during the investigation of the 1915 British football betting scandal, which led to the banning of seven Manchester United and Liverpool players.

They are esters of phosphoric acid H3PO4 and corresponding alcohol. For example, the formula of methyl phosphate is CH3-H2PO4, dimethyl phosphate ‚Äì (CH3)2HPO4 and trimethyl phosphate ‚Äì (CH3)3PO4. Alkyl phosphates are widely distributed in nature, and form the basis of most biological processes. For example, high energy metabolites such as ATP and PEP are alkyl phosphates, as are nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA. Alkyl phosphates are also important medicinally, for example the HIV drug AZT is inactive until it becomes an alkyl phosphate in vivo. Dialkyl phosphate In Dialkyl phosphates, two of the hydrogens in phosphoric acid are replaced by alkyl groups, e.g. dimethyl phosphate ‚Äì (CH3)2HPO4 =Agricultural use= Dialkyl phosphates or dialkyl phosphate esters are used in many agricultural chemicals. Levels in the urine have been used as a method of trying to determine levels of exposure to organophosphates; however, it is unclear how well they do this. =Health effects= Exposure to dialkyl phosphate during pregnancy appears to increase the risk of ADHD.

Life Herbert McCabe was born in Middlesbrough in the North Riding of Yorkshire. He studied chemistry at Manchester University, but influenced by Dorothy Emmet switched to philosophy. He contributed a number of pieces to Humanitas, and became friends with Eric John among others.\\"Herbert McCabe\\", obit, The Guardian McCabe joined the Dominicans in 1949, where under Victor White he began his lifelong study of the works of Thomas Aquinas. Born John Ignatius McCabe, his novice master, Columba Ryan, gave McCabe the religious name Herbert, in honour of Saint Herbert of Derwentwater, a seventh-century Lakeland hermit. Ordained in 1955, was a pastor in Newcastle for three years before being assigned as chaplain to De La Salle College, where one of his pupils was Terry Eagleton. In 1965, he was sent to Cambridge as editor of the journal New Blackfriars in 1965 but was removed in 1967 following a now-famous editorial in that journal in which he criticised the theologian Charles Davis for having left the Catholic Church. Davis left publicly, denouncing the church as corrupt. McCabe countered that of course the Church was corrupt but that this was no reason to leave it. He was reinstated three years later, and began his editorial that month in characteristically combative style: \\"As I was saying, before I was so oddly interrupted....\\" He spent many years teaching at Blackfriars, Oxford University, writing four books, The New Creation, a study of the Sacraments, in 1964; Law, Love and Language, on the centrality of language in ethics, in 1968; The Teaching of the Catholic Church, a short catechism, in 1986; God Matters in 1987; and God Still Matters, a collection of his articles, in 2002. He was a member of the Slant group, and combined a commitment to the thought of Aquinas and Wittgenstein with a socialist political stance. McCabe's sermons were carefully prepared and delivered with great intelligence and wit. A major theme was a caution against making God a god, of reducing the Creator to an object within this world, and thus committing idolatry. In 1974 McCabe became an Irish citizen.Obituary in the Telegraph Terry Eagleton attributed to his friend McCabe the view that 'If you don't love, you're dead, and if you do, they'll kill you.' Terry Eagleton, 'The God Debate,' Gifford Lecture 2010 53:22 McCabe died at Oxford on 28 June 2001, and was buried at Wolvercote Cemetery on 5 July.

He scored a total of 5,185 points, in 169 games played in the Yugoslav League, for a career scoring average of 30.7 points per game. Koraƒá once scored 74 points in a Yugoslav League game. With OKK Beograd, he won four Yugoslav League titles. Koraƒá also played in multiple FIBA European Champions' Cup (EuroLeague) competitions with OKK Beograd. Koraƒá was named a part of the best European selection, in both 1964 and 1965. In a two-game playoff series against Swedish League champions Alviks, during the 1964‚Äì65 season of the FIBA European Champions' Cup (EuroLeague), he scored 170 points. He scored 71 points in the first game of the series, and 99 points in the second game of the series, for a series scoring average of 85 points per game.Euroleague.net Radivoj Korac's 99 points. He averaged 54.8 points per game that season, which is the highest single-season scoring average in the EuroLeague's history, since 1958. Koraƒá's career scoring average in the EuroLeague was 43.6 points per game. He was also the best scorer in the Belgian League in 1968, while playing with Standard Li√®ge, and the Italian League's best scorer in 1969, while playing with Padova. National team career Koraƒá entered into the senior Yugoslavian national basketball team in 1958, and went on to win five silver medals, and one bronze medal with them, in a total of 157 international games. He was the EuroBasket's Top Scorer 4 times (1959, 1961, 1963, 1965), and was named the MVP of EuroBasket 1961. He also won the silver medal at both the 1963 FIBA World Championship, and the 1967 FIBA World Championship. He was the Top Scorer of the 1960 Summer Olympic Games,FIBA.com 1960 Olympic Games: Tournament For Men. and he won the silver medal at the 1968 Summer Olympic Games.

He was a senior undergraduate, from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering (ETF), at the University of Belgrade. Surprisingly, he once turned down a contract offer to play with Red Star Belgrade. Death and legacy On Monday 2 June 1969, Koraƒá died in a car crash, just outside of Sarajevo, on the road between Vogo≈°ƒáa and Semizovac. The Yugoslav Basketball Federation decided that no basketball games would be played in Yugoslavia, on the 2nd of June again.

In the early nineteenth century, when news broke of the building of the North Midland Railway, it was clear that George Stephenson would follow the gentle gradient of the Rivers Rother and Don, bypassing Sheffield. Stephenson known for his railway building techniques never built lines with gradients higher than 1 in 130. Despite representations by Sheffield people, who engaged Joseph Locke to state their case, and from Charles Vignoles and George Hudson to convince Stephenson to bring the NMR to Sheffield, the NMR was built via the Rother valley, to the east of Sheffield. Planning Much work had already been done in surveying the land between Rotherham and Sheffield with plans being put forward for a canal linking Tinsley to Sheffield earlier in the century. This was originally planned to follow a route to the north of the River Don to a basin in (or near) Saville Street. Plans were changed when it was realised that this route would preclude coal from the Duke of Norfolk's estate from directly reaching the waterway, and a new route to the south of the river used. The railway was aligned approximately north-northeast so that it also followed a gentle gradient, making use of the same route as was planned for the canal. The act for the incorporation of the company received the Royal assent on 4 July 1836, authorising a capital of ¬£100,000 and the facility to raise a loan of a further ¬£30,000. A second act was obtained on 23 March 1840. The first director was George Wilton Chambers, a coal master. Its secretary was Thomas Pearson, a civil engineer and also a coal master. The engineers were John Stephenson (not known to be a relation of George) who introduced scientific methods into earthwork construction and the excavation of deep cuttings, and Isaac Dodds whose \\"talent for invention was highly respected in his day\\" Superintending the construction was Frederick Swanwick, a pupil of George Stephenson, who was nominally engineering chief. Construction From Wicker Station in Sheffield the line proceeded to the first stopping place at Grimesthorpe Bridge. It then followed the River Don to the next stop at Holmes then a short lived station called Blackburn Forge (closed 1839), then passing close to Masbrough where the North Midland Railway would later cross it. The line then crossed the River Don arriving at Westgate Station in Rotherham. Example of fishbelly rail The whole line was just over 5 miles more or less straight, with gentle gradients apart from a one in 68 section just before Rotherham. There were 13 bridges, six level crossings and five footpath crossings. The track was laid to the standard gauge of , since it would meet the North Midland Railway, and used fish bellied rail at about 50 lb. to the yard, on stone blocks or plain larch sleepers. Opening The line in 1840, as show in Drake's Roadbook of the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway. Although earthworks were unfinished and the second track had not been laid, the railway opened on 31 October 1838. The first train, on 31 October, transported Earl Fitzwilliam and guests to Rotherham. A celebration breakfast followed by the obligatory speeches were held at the Court House. The Rotherham proprietors used the return train to Sheffield. On the following day, 1 November 1838, came the public opening. The first train was pulled by Victory and consisted of six yellow and black carriages, holding 300 passengers. The line's trackside, trees and bridge were filled with crowds who'd turned up for the event. Victory travelled to Rotherham in 17 minutes. Locomotive London was the next one to travel to Rotherham and followed 2 minutes later. The first returning train met locomotive Leeds at Meadow Hall. The number of passengers in the first year was double that which had been predicted when the line was put before Parliament. Advertised fares were 1s first class, 9d second and 6d third class. No tips were allowed, and neither was smoking in the station. Passenger trains were usually of three carriages, and made the journey in about 20 minutes, including two intermediate stops. Departures from Wicker were timetabled at 8 am, 9 am, 10 am, 12 noon, 2 pm, 4 pm and 6 pm (plus a departure at 7 pm on Mondays) and 8.30 am, 9.30 am, 10.30 am, 2.30 pm, 4.30 pm and 6.30 pm from Rotherham. Operation The North Midland Railway opened in 1840, crossing the S&R; near Masbrough. A branch was built to link the railway to the North Midland in a northerly direction from Sheffield at Rotherham Masborough station. A path to the south was installed in 1869. On 7 August 1839 the railway opened a branch from its main line at Holmes to the head of the Greasbrough Canal, where it connected with the colliery wagonways of Earl Fitzwilliam. The facilities at Greasbrough were rather primitive and were felt to be the cause for poor results on coal traffic operations. At a meeting of shareholders on 15 February 1840, were discussed arrangements for working after the North Midland Railway opened later in the year. It was hoped that traffic would increase and so the decision to build a booking office at Wicker station as well as a locomotive depot was taken. The decision to allow NMR stock to work throughout the S&R; was taken in April 1840, avoiding the need to change train at Masbrough. The line from Leeds opened on 1 July 1840, and a corresponding service with trains form Sheffield was established. The first train from Leeds was scheduled to arrive at Masbrough 0945, but the train from Sheffield saw no sign of the Leeds train. Having left at 8 am, it arrived at 1030 due to weather conditions. The Sheffield portion of the train was attached at the back of the Leeds train, and it then progressed south. The train arrived in Derby at 1.15 pm. Popular railway travel for citizens of Sheffield arrived on Monday 28 September 1840 when the NMR ran a half-price excursion to Leeds. On the first day this operation, 61 carriages were pulled by 5 locomotives. NMR fares from Derby to Sheffield were 11s first class and 7s second class. The S&R; dispensed with second class altogether. Locomotive Sheffield was chosen to pull one carriage on the full line. It departed on 11 April and was expected to arrive in Birmingham on 13 April. The train's only passengers were Mr and Mrs Vickers, who were joined by George Stephenson and Michael Longridge in Derby. The London & Birmingham Railway obviously had a great sense of humour as they fined the Sheffield & Rotherham ¬£10 for running over L&B; lines without a fourteen-day notice. Nevertheless, as Whishaw put it: Before the introduction of railways, a journey from London to this place was attended with considerable fatigue, and occupied the best part of twenty- four hours; whereas, by the united efforts of four private companies, Sheffield is now within little more than an eight hours' easy drive of the metropolis. Whishaw, F, (1840) The Railways of Great Britain and Ireland: Practically described and illustrated London: Simpkin, Marshall and Co. Locomotives and rolling stock  Among the first of the duties which fell to Isaac Dodds was designing the railway's first engine The Cutler. While up to that time, locomotive boilers had been fastened rigidly to the frames, Dodds fastened it at the front only, allowing for movement with expansion at the firebox end.Ransom, P.J. G., (1990) The Victorian Railway and How It Evolved, (p177) London: Heinemann Whether this locomotive was built by him, or whether the railway itself built any, is unclear, though Dodds left in 1842 to set up in business on his own. Certainly, at that time, demand may have been outstripping supply. One engine, the 2-2-2 Agilis was supplied in 1839 by Fenton, Murray and Jackson, who provided another Rotherham, built under subcontract by Bingley and Company of Leeds. Another, the Sheffield, said to be the first to have been built in that city, was provided in 1840 by Davy Brothers. This was a six-wheeled locomotive to design of a Mr. William Vickers. The 5 ft 6 inch drivers were connected to the other wheel by four- inch belts which provided traction on all wheels. It was later, it is believed, converted to a conventional pattern.Lowe, J.W., (1989) British Steam Locomotive Builders, Guild Publishing By 1840 the line owned six locomotives, all six-wheeled, with one or more supplied by Robert Stephenson and Company. Although services began with three classes of carriage, the second class was soon discarded. The first class consisted of the usual three compartments each holding six people and had Losh's patent wheels. The third class coaches apart from two were enclosed and held about 40 passengers, probably standing, and had the usual cast-iron wheels. Apart from one sheep truck, all the goods wagons belonged to Earl Fitzwilliam the coal owner. Later history Economic stagnation in 1841 and 1842 meant that the S&R; saw little profit the following years. In January 1843, the line's only intermediate station, Grimesthorpe Bridge closed. By February 1844 the S&R; had decided that expansion regardless of cost was the only way to protect itself. A start was made in 1847 by the construction of a small connecting line with the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway (SA&MR;) at Bridgehouses. This short steeply graded line, enclosed within a tunnel for almost its entire length was known locally as the Fiery Jack. The company‚Äôs half-yearly meeting held in August 1844 was a messy affair. The exact date at which the meeting was to be held was not known, and no agenda had been established. Accusations of share trafficking were made.Batty, S.R., (2004) Rail Centres Sheffield, S.R. Batty. (p20) Nottingham: Booklaw Publications The recession faded away in 1843 and the Great Midland Amalgamation Bill passed parliament on 10 May 1844, creating the Midland Railway. In September, the S&R; began negotiations with the MR for either sale or lease of its railway to the MR. Terms were agreed upon quickly, and the MR started operations on 10 October 1844. The title of S&R; existed on paper until the takeover was finally authorised by an Act on 21 July 1845. In 1870 the Midland built a line from Chesterfield through Sheffield via the Bradway Tunnel, which rejoined the old line at Masbrough. The majority of the line is still in use today.

An alpha build of the Subtext environment, which illustrates the unique \\"polymorphic conditionals\\" present in the IDE. Subtext is a moderately visual programming language and environment, for writing application software. It is an experimental, research attempt to develop a new programming model, called Example Centric Programming, by treating copied blocks as first class prototypes, for program structure. It uses live text, similar to what occurs in spreadsheets as users update cells, for frequent feedback. It is intended to eventually be developed enough to become a practical language for daily use. It is planned to be open software; the license is not yet determined. Subtext was created by Jonathan Edwards who submitted a paper on the language to OOPSLA. It was accepted as part of the 2005 conference. Environment Early build of the Subtext environment with the program's current state visible. The employee data (like \\"wage\\") is visibly changed after invoking the \\"Raise\\" method by clicking its \\"invoke arrow\\", and the hypothetical state (displayed within the Raise method) is also updated. Early build of the Subtext environment with interactive console inputs. Early video previews of the Subtext environment were released circa 2006,Introduction to Subtext, I/O and Mutable state, first Subtext environment video demo which demonstrated the semantics of Subtext programs, and the close integration with the Subtex environment and runtime. Subtext programs are declared and manipulated (or mutated) by adding and linking elements of various types to a syntax tree, and entering in values or names as necessary, as opposed to typing out textual programs. Due to the design of the Subtext language and environment, there is no distinction between a program's representation and its execution. Like spreadsheets, Subtext programs are live executions within an environment and runtime, and programming is direct manipulation of these executions via a graphical environment. Unlike typical functional programming languages, Subtext has simple semantics and is easily applicable to reactive systems that require mutable state, I/O, and concurrency, under a model known as \\"Reactive Programming\\".First Class Copy & Paste, MIT CSAIL draft paper by Jonathan Edwards in 2006. Console input (\\"invocations\\") can be utilized via data flow within a Subtext program, allowing users to manipulate values interactively. Coherence A continuation and subset of the Subtext language using other principles,Coherence home page, states continuation of Subtext is Coherence, an experimental programming language and environment, which uses a new model of change-driven computation called \\"Coherent reaction\\", to coordinate the effects and side-effects of programs interactively as they are being developed. The language is specialized for interactive application software, and is being designed by the creator of Subtext, Jonathan Edwards, who reports upon its development by publishing white papers. Logo for the Coherence programming language State changes trigger events called reactions, that in turn change other states. A coherent execution order is one in which each reaction executes before any others that are affected by its changes. A coherent order is discovered iteratively by detecting incoherencies as they occur and backtracking their effects. The fundamental building block of Coherence is the dynamically typed mutable tree. The fundamental abstraction mechanism is the virtual tree, whose value is lazily computed, and whose behavior is generated by coherent reactions.DSpace@MIT : Coherent Reaction, CSAIL Digital Archive, Technical Reports References *Example Centric Programming Jonathan Edwards.

Dual roles (or a larger number of roles for an actor) may be deliberately written into a script, or may instead be a choice made during production, often due to a low budget. In film and television, dual roles are often used for comic effect, or to depict identical twins. In a theatrical production where more than one actor plays multiple characters, it is sometimes referred to as an \\"Ironman\\" cast. Theatre In theatre, the use of multiple roles may be budget-related, may be intended to give an accomplished actor more stage time or a greater challenge, or may be of thematic significance to the story. The combination of factors leading to such a decision may often remain unknown. For example, debate exists over the significance of William Shakespeare's use of dual roles, with a notable example being whether the characters of Cordelia and the Fool in King Lear were intended to be one and the same, or whether the mysterious Third Murderer in Macbeth is actually Macbeth himself. In the works of absurdists such as Tom Stoppard, characters played by the same actor are often of thematic significance. In the musical Hamilton, four actors/actresses are cast in dual roles, each a major supporting character, with a change of roles between the first and second acts. The actors who play John Laurens/Philip Hamilton, Lafayette/Thomas Jefferson, and Hercules Mulligan/James Madison wear identical white costumes in the opening song, \\"Alexander Hamilton\\", and were given lines with intentional double meanings that would fit either of their dual roles.  Film  Lee Marvin won an Academy Award for Best Actor for a dual role in Cat Ballou (1965), and Nicolas Cage was nominated for Best Actor for a dual role in Adaptation (2002). In some low-budget films, actors have been cast in more than one role to save money. Multiple casting has often included the casting of an actor as multiple members of the same family. Starting in the 1970s, having a living double in a Bollywood film became \\"almost a genre in itself,\\" according to filmmaker Govind Nihalani. Television In television, soap operas have commonly used the technique to either portray twins (or even similar looking relatives), or to bring an actor back whose character has been killed.

He is the husband of Victorian Senator Kimberley Kitching. Early life and business career Landeryou is the son of Bill Landeryou, a former Leader of the Opposition and then the Government in the Victorian Legislative Council and a minister in the Australian Labor Party Victorian state government of John Cain. Andrew Landeryou was active in the Labor Party, and particularly the Labor Right faction. He was elected as President of Melbourne University Student Union, taking office in January 1991. A referendum of union members removed him after five months when he proposed commercialising the union's services. He then became managing director of IQ Corporation, a sports statistics company, which was invested in by Solomon Lew until it went into liquidation in 2003. He was also a co-owner of Marbain, a company with a contract with MUSU. After he failed to answer a court summons in December 2004, Landeryou spent five months in Costa Rica. In May 2005, he was arrested on his return to Australia and required to attend at a liquidator's examination of the affairs of MUSU. Landeryou was declared bankrupt by the Federal Magistrates Court in May 2006. Blogging In 2005, Landeryou established a weblog commenting on Australian party politics called The Other Cheek ‚Äì Andrew Landeryou's Blog of Freedom. Lucy Saunders, a political activist linked to the Socialist Left who had been criticised by Landeryou, wrote on ABC News Online that \\"The overwhelming majority of what Landeryou prints is vague rumour, personal vendettas and outright fiction. Very occasionally, though, some actual facts sneak through.\\" He clashed with another political blogger, Stephen Mayne, in 2006 when they accused each other of being spivs. After The Other Cheek was deleted in 2008, Landeryou launched the short-lived tabloid website VEXNEWS, which closed in 2013.VEXNEWS (archived) Andrew Bolt from the Herald Sun referred to Landeryou as \\"always entertaining\\" and \\"often compelling,\\" while The Age newspaper described the site as \\"dirt-dishing\\". VEXNEWS broke a story revealing AFL footballer Brendan Fevola's attack on a Melbourne journalist. Landeryou also broke a story drawing on Liberal party sources when he revealed that the authors of an anti- Ted Baillieu website were employees of Baillieu's own party. Other front-page stories prompted by Landeryou include a Fairfax story about Australian politicians sanitising their Wikipedia articles and a story about a Christian Family First candidate who had exposed himself in photographs. Landeryou declared him 'Australia's smallest loser', an epithet repeated by MSNBC's Keith Olbermann when he covered the story for US cable news.Andrew Quah International Media Mega Star Appears on MSNBC ‚Äì YouTube Legal issues =Vandalism conviction= Landeryou was arrested along with two other men in St Kilda at 2.40am on the morning of the 2016 federal election, with police stating that they seized box cutters from the car the men were travelling in. They were charged over an alleged vandalism spree in the Melbourne electorate of Labor MP Michael Danby. At the time, Bill Shorten said ‚Äúanyone in an election who is conducting vandalism deserves to have the book thrown at them‚Äù. Victorian Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie told the Federal Parliament that the four men had been arrested ‚Äúfor allegedly vandalising Greens and Liberal polling material at multiple polling stations from Elwood to Port Melbourne‚Äù and ‚Äúallegedly driving at volunteers who tried to stop them‚Äù. Landeryou was reportedly charged with five counts of damaging and five counts of stealing rival Liberal and Greens campaign advertising material. On 28 April 2017 he pleaded guilty to the charges. Magistrate Ann Collins ordered Landeryou and his co-accused David Boutros-Asmar, George Droutsas and Dean Sherrif to pay $1,000 to the court and told them \\"You acted more like schoolboys than like adults\\". They were ordered to write letters of apology to people whose signs they had taken down and letters of gratitude to prosecutors who had recommended them for the court diversion program, which allows people to avoid convictions for minor crimes if they take responsibility for them. =Restraining order= In 2018, Landeryou purchased the domain name davidlangsam.com, and used it to portray David Langsam ‚Äì a journalist who edits Biotech Daily ‚Äì as \\"some kind of Rene Rivkin-style tout pitching stocks without a financial services licence\\". Langsam, who does not offer stock tips, successfully applied for an interim intervention order against Landeryou in the Melbourne Magistrate's Court, which prohibits Landeryou from contacting him, approaching him, or writing about him. The two parties then reached an out-of-court settlement where Landeryou agreed to turn the domain over to Langsam.

One of their first actions was to appoint W.E.H. Stanner to organise a conference on the state of Aboriginal Studies in Australia, to be held in 1961 at the ANU. Academics and anthropologists in the field of Aboriginal Studies attended the conference, and contributed research papers published in a conference report in 1963.Shiels, H (ed) 1963, Australian Aboriginal Studies: A Symposium of Papers at 1961 Research Conference, Oxford University Press, Melbourne No Aboriginal people were present at the conference. The Prime Minister, Robert Menzies appointed an Interim Council in 1961. The role of the Interim Council was to plan for a national Aboriginal research organisation and establish how this organisation would interact with existing research and scientific bodies. The Interim Council was also tasked with immediately developing a programme that would identify and address urgent research needs.'Australian Institute for Aboriginal Studies Agency Details', National Archives of Australia, www.naa.gov.au, retrieved 28 October 2014. The Interim Council consisted of 16 members and was chaired by Deputy Vice- Chancellor of the ANU, Professor AD Trendall, officially recognised as the first Chair of the institute now known as AIATSIS.'Chairs and Principals of AIATSIS', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/about-us/governance-and- structure/executive/chairs-and-principals , retrieved 17 March 2015 In August 1962, a draft constitution for the institute was submitted to the Menzies government, and rejected.

These were: :(a) to sponsor and to foster research of a scientific nature on the Australian Aborigines. :(b) to treat as a matter of urgency those studies for which the source materials are disappearing. :(c) to establish and conduct a documentation centre on the Aborigines, and a library of books, manuscripts and other relevant material, both for the use of scholars and for public education. :(d) to encourage co-operation with and between scholars in universities, museums, and other institutions engaged in studies of the Aborigines, and with appropriate private bodies. :(e) to publish and to support the publication of the results of research. :(f) to co- operate with appropriate bodies concerning the financing of research, the preservation of sites, and the collection of records. :(g) to promote as and when necessary the training of research workers. :(h) to establish and maintain relations with relevant international bodies. AIAS had a twenty-two member Council, composed mainly of academics, and had a foundation membership of one hundred.

The creation of the AIAS provided an opportunity for greater cross-discipline interaction in fields relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies in Australia. The Institute‚Äôs founding principal, Fred McCarthy, was an advocate of film as an important part of research methodology as early as his tenure as curator of anthropology at the Australian Museum in Sydney in the 1940s. This was evident in the contributions he made during his involvement in establishing the AIAS and also as its principal, in continuing to support the development of the AIAS Film UnitBryson, Ian (2002), 'Capturing a changing culture: The first phase of the Film Unit' , Bringing to Light: a history of ethnographic filmmaking at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra, p 18-19 and championing ethnographic film in global forums.

And again in 1972, with the appointment of Dick Roughsey to replace Phillip Roberts at the end of his term.Lambert 2011, p. 128 The appointment of Phillip Roberts to the Council reflected a growing pressure for an increase in Aboriginal representation within the Institute. But the move did not allay the belief held by some Aboriginal activists that the AIAS was engaging in 'tokenism' in the extent to which Aboriginal people were involved in the administration of Aboriginal Studies.Widders, Thompson, Bellear & Watson (1974), Eaglehawk and Crow: an open letter concerning the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, 29 March, AIAS, cited in Lambert 2011, p. 142 The changes to the Institute that would take place in the following decade were also influenced by the shifting social and political landscape in Australia.Lambert 2011, p. 107 The Aboriginal rights movement was growing and Aboriginal people were demanding a voice on Council, consultation with communities and an increased focus on projects relevant to the needs of Indigenous people. In 1972, the Whitlam government was elected.

The Aboriginal Advisory Committee was established in 1975, and consisted of the six Aboriginal members of the AIAS Council.Lambert 2011, p. 164 Early recommendations including increased representation of Aboriginal people on committees and the AIAS Council as well as employment at the Institute. The committee was renamed in 1978, to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advisory Committee.Lambert 2011, p. 185 In 1975‚Äì1976, a category of research grants for Aboriginal researchers was introduced. The emergence of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people filling the role of 'cultural practitioner', travelling to the AIAS to provide advice on projects and research being undertaken, was also documented from around 1976 onwards.Lambert 2011, p. 175 The time Peter Ucko spent as Principal of the AIAS saw a phase of \\"rapid expansion\\" for the Institute. The AIAS Film Unit that had operated in Sydney until 1973 was re-established in Canberra in 1975. Prominent American-born ethnographic filmmaker David MacDougall was appointed as the Director of this new AIAS Film Unit. With his wife and filmmaking partner Judith, and Kim McKenzie, the Film Unit operated until 1988 when its functions were absorbed back into the Institute.

The filmmakers also practised a more collaborative approach to their films, and chose to use translations and subtitles to give direct access to the subjects voice and thoughts rather than the dominant 'voice of god' narration style.MacDougall, David, 'Subtitling Ethnographic Films: Archetypes into Individualities', Visual Anthropology Review, 11 (1): 83‚Äì91 One of the most notable films produced towards the end of this period was Waiting for Harry, a prize-winning film\\"Waiting for Harry\\", Royal Anthropological Institute website, https://www.therai.org.uk/film/volume-ii-contents/waiting-for-harry , retrieved 11 November 2014 directed by Kim McKenzie with anthropologist Les Hiatt and now considered to exemplify the \\"style of collaborative filmmaking\\" the Film Unit favoured in their work. The power of film to \\"influence opinion\\" was becoming increasingly recognised and with this, the lack of representation of Aboriginal people telling their own stories. In 1978, a meeting chaired by prominent activist and academic Marcia Langton expressed these concerns, arguing for greater access to film and video in Aboriginal communities, and training in film production by the AIAS. By the following year, the AIAS Film Unit had begun to implement a training program and had started employing trainee Aboriginal filmmakers on productions by the early 1980s.'A Short History of Indigenous Filmmaking', Australian Screen Online website, http://aso.gov.au/titles/collections/indigenous-filmmaking/, retrieved 10 November 2014 The AIAS began presenting a biennial Wentworth Lecture in 1978, named as a tribute to W.C.

At the time, there were four Aboriginal staff members, making up around 7% of the total staff.Lambert 2011, p. 280 This was followed in 1985 with the creation of the role of Aboriginal Studies Coordination Officer within the AIAS, whose responsibilities involved improving access for Aboriginal people to the research and resources of the Institute. The 'After 200 Years' project was launched in 1985, aiming to fill some of the gaps in the AIAS photographic collection; particularly images of daily life in the southern, urban parts of Australia. Aboriginal involvement in selecting subject matter, photographing and documenting the collection was a major part of the project. The three-year project culminated in the publication of a book containing hundreds of photographs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and selected by them to represent their community.Taylor, Penny.

The recordings represent a breadth of cultural and historical information including languages, ceremonies, music, oral histories and interviews with participants in significant events such as the 1965 Freedom Rides and Prime Minister Kevin Rudd‚Äôs Apology to the Stolen Generations.'Sound', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/sound, retrieved 12 March 2015 =Acquisitions= Since the establishment of the Institute in 1964, the AIATSIS collection has been developed through acquisition by donation, gift and purchase or, through materials created and collected during the work of ethnographic field researchers and filmmakers funded by the AIATSIS grants program. The collection has also been built through deposits of materials, an arrangement which permits the original owners to assign access and use conditions appropriate to the cultural information contained in the items. AIATSIS' approach to collection building is based on three primary criteria: :1. Comprehensiveness ‚Äì the aim is to have the collection be as comprehensive as possible. Given limited resources, the Audiovisual Archive focuses primarily on unpublished audio and visual materials and the Library generally on published materials. Other items are collected where possible. :2. Significance ‚Äì items that meet this criteria are considered to make 'a lasting contribution to worldwide knowledge', reflect current AIATSIS research areas, valued by a particular Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community, are not well represented in other collections, have a link to AIATSIS' own history. :3. Representativeness ‚Äì when resources are limited, AIATSIS will focus on collecting items that are 'representative of a particular class of creativity, research discipline or mode of cultural production.' =Collection management= Once material has been acquired by AIATSIS, the Institute faces the challenges of maintaining a cultural resource collection.AIATSIS Act 1989, Section 5 (e) This is achieved through a collection management plan that involves processes of recording and cataloguing, and appropriate storage and handling to extend the life of physical items and preserving their content through format shifting. Preservation of physical items in the collection is achieved in two key ways: :1. Assessment and monitoring for contaminants, such as insects and mould, as well as any potential deterioration through environmental factors or physical damage.‚Äò'AIATSIS Collection Management Plan 2013‚Äì2016'‚Äô, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/collection-management- plan.pdf, retrieved 12 March 2015 :2. Storage of collection items in climate- controlled vaults, to maintain their integrity and to minimise contact with deteriorating agents such as moisture and light. The Institute also follows international archiving guidelines for the storage and preservation of materials.'Preservation, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/caring-collection/preservation, retrieved 12 March 2015 There are a wide variety of analogue photograph, tape and film formats held in the AIATSIS collection, which pose special preservation and future access risks. The age of some of these formats and materials, combined with the varying conditions in which they were stored prior to their acquisition by AIATSIS, heightens the deterioration of the media. Another preservation issue inherent in these analogue materials is the machines that can play back that particular format, as in some cases the material and the playback device are no longer manufactured. To manage these risks and maintain future access to the collection, preservation of the actual content contained in collection items is also achieved through a program of digitisation.'Caring for the collection', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/caring-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015An AIATSIS pictorial technician prepares a tin type photograph for scanningDue to the potential issues of long-term archiving and storage of digital items, the opposite process is often employed to ensure access and preservation.'Future Watch: Strategies for Long-Term Preservation of Electronic Records', Gordon E.J Hoke, CRM, http://content.arma.org/IMM/May- June2012/futurewatchstrategiesforlongtermpreservation.aspx , retrieved 25 February 2015'Electronic Records ‚Äì Problem Solved?: the Victorian Electronic Records Strategy and the future of electronic record keeping in Victoria', VALA website, http://www.vala.org.au/vala2000/2000pdf/Gib_Hea.PDF, retrieved 25 February 2015 In the case of digital publications and manuscripts, the originals will often be printed and incorporated into the print collections as an additional preservation measure. The AIATSIS collection holds material that is sensitive and/or secret/sacred to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.'Using the collection', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015 In accordance with its founding Act,AIATSIS Act, Section 41, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aioaatsisa1989702/s41.html, retrieved 23 February 2015 and as part of their collection management plan, AIATSIS adheres to strict protocols when handling and processing these sensitive items. The Institute also supports and adheres to the protocols developed by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Library, Information and Resource Network (ATSILIRN). Restricted visual media such as photographs and printed items are stored separately to the rest of the collection and audio and moving image items are not played until any cultural requirements are checked. Restricted material must also be carefully handled during digitisation, which means that the work is carried out in secured conditions such as enclosed booths and by staff that can meet the protocols of the item being digitised.'AIATSIS Collection Access and Use Policy', p 8, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/collections- access-use-policy.pdf, retrieved 12 March 2015 (R-L) The Shadow Telecine for motion picture film and the Sondor Magnetic film dubber, used by the AIATSIS Moving Image Unit to convert film stock to video tape or file =Digitisation program= AIATSIS launched its Library Digitisation Pilot Program in 2001, before which the Library had no dedicated digitisation equipment or policies for managing digital materials. This two-year program was originally funded by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), and involved the creation of digital collections across the institution. Since then AIATSIS has continued to incorporate digitisation of the collection into its management plan, but have publicly stated that an increase in funding is required for the Institute to digitise some of the at risk formats held in the collection before those items are lost.Barnsley, Warren, \\"AIATSIS digitisation funding welcome but still 'inadequate'\\", National Indigenous Radio Service, 16 May 2014, http://nirs.org.au/blog/NEWS/article/33902/AIATSIS-digitisation-funding- welcome-but-still-inadequate.htmlRaggatt, Matthew, \\"Historic indigenous collection in 'severe and catastrophic state'\\", The Canberra Times, 6 December 2014, http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/historic-indigenous-collection- in-severe-and-catastrophic-state-20141206-121hl1.html Given these limitations, AIATSIS prioritises the selection of materials for digitisation using factors including significance of the item/s, the level of deterioration, cultural protocols, copyright status, and client demand. One of the identified priorities of the program is to digitise and preserve all of the audiovisual collection currently on endangered magnetic tape formats by the 2025 deadline set by UNESCO. =Access to the collection= Library stacks showing some of the print collection available at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, in Canberra, ACT, Australia The collection is housed in the AIATSIS building on Acton Peninsula and is accessible through a number of resources. The AIATSIS Library is open to the public and holds a range of printed materials including manuscripts, journals, readers in different Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages, dictionaries, published books and rare books, maps, and posters. Access to AIATSIS' print and manuscript collections can be made through the Library's Stanner Reading Room and the film, sound and pictorial collections by appointment through the Access Unit. These physical access points are open limited hours.'Visiting the collection', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using- collection/visiting-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015 The AIATSIS Digitisation Program contributes to increased access to the collection; whether access is through on site resources, the provision of copies of materials or the sharing of the collection online. Due to increasing obsolescence of analogue formats, AIATSIS identifies digitisation as the way to preserve those items for future generations to access. This is considered to be particularly important for facilitating \\"remote access by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities\\" as well as for access by researchers and the general public. The AIATSIS Access Unit runs a program called Return of Material to Indigenous Communities (ROMTIC), through which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients are provided with up to twenty copies of collection materials that relate to their language group or family. This service is limited to items that have been preserved, so AIATSIS' digitisation program has allowed an increasing number of digital items available to ROMTIC clients.'Return of materials to Indigenous communities', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/return-material-indigenous- communities, retrieved 12 March 2015 AIATSIS also makes the collection available through a series of online exhibitions and digitised collection material published on their website.'Collections online', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/collections-onlinel, retrieved 12 March 2015 These showcase different themes or discrete collections of material, including: *A.M.

The game was initially to be developed by Big Rooster for PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade and Windows PCs through Steam, with possible versions for the Wii and the Nintendo DS. However, only Xbox Live Arcade and Windows Phone 7 versions have been confirmed after development of the game was resumed by Babaroga. The Xbox Live Arcade version has never been released. Game play The game play of Zombies is closely modeled on the original board game. Players move their \\"shotgun guy\\" (player piece) around the board trying to reach the helipad tile to escape the ever-growing zombie horde. Alternately, players can win the game by killing 25 zombies. The Windows Phone 7 version of Zombies uses the touchscreen of the device for all control input. For example, players tap a die graphic to roll for character movement, zombie movement, and combat. Players can use touchscreen gestures to zoom in and out of the board as well as scroll to view different areas of the board. The initial Windows Phone 7 release of Zombies supports single-player as well as multiplayer game play on one device. Human players can play against up to four CPU or human opponents in a \\"pass and play\\" game. In this style of play, Player 1 takes their turn, then passes the device to Player 2, who takes their turn and passes to Player 3, etc. According to developer Babaroga, on-line multiplayer for Zombies is in development for a future update to the game which may also include play \\"across multiple hardware setups.\\" Single-player game play in Zombies is a \\"Survival Mode\\" in which the \\"shotgun guy\\" is placed in a randomly generated town full of zombies. The player must move their \\"shotgun guy\\" to the helipad tile (as in a standard multi-player game) or kill all the zombies in the town in order to win the game. Development Development of Zombies by Big Rooster was originally announced in October 2008. In October 2009, videogame news site Joystiq reported that Twilight Creations was looking for another company to develop the game, but could not \\"disclose the status of [former developer] Big Rooster.\\" No further word on the game appeared until Microsoft announced a list of Xbox Live-compatible titles for their Windows Phone 7 platform at Gamescom 2010. Developed by Babaroga, the Windows Phone 7 version of Zombies was released on 12 January 2011. A version of the game for Xbox Live Arcade has been confirmed and is in active development.

A development of the 9K111 Fagot with greater firepower, the 9M113 Konkurs can use the same launchers and is very similar visually, distinguishable only by a slight bulge towards the end of the Konkurs' missile tube. Development The 9M113 Konkurs was developed by the Tula Machinery Design Bureau (Tula KBP). Development began with the aim of producing the next generation of SACLOS anti-tank missiles, for use in both the man-portable role and the tank destroyer role. The 9M113 Konkurs was developed alongside the 9M111; the missiles use similar technology, differing only in size. The original 9M113 with a single-charge warhead can penetrate 600 mm of rolled homogeneous armor (RHA). The missile entered service in 1974. Iran bought a license for the Konkurs in 1991 and began producing a copy, the Tosan (not to be confused with the Toophan), sometime around 2000.http://modlex.ir/cgi-bin/store.pl/page=product.html/pid=MXF05-000060 Chistopher F. Foss, Jane's Defence Weekly, Another ATGW for Iran Description 9M113 Konkurs launching rails on the top of 9P148 vehicle The missile is designed to be fired from vehicles, although it can also be fired from the later models of 9M111 launchers. It is an integral part of the BMP-2, BMD-2 and BRDM-2 vehicles. The missile is stored and carried in a fiberglass container/launch tube. The system uses a gas generator to push the missile out of the launch tube. The gas also exits from the rear of the launch tube in a similar manner to a recoilless rifle. The missile leaves the launch tube at 80 meters per second, and is quickly accelerated to 200 meters per second by its solid fuel motor. This initial high speed reduces the missile's deadzone, since it can be launched directly at the target, rather than in an upward arc. In flight, the missile spins at between five and seven revolutions per second. The launcher tracks the position of an incandescent infrared bulb on the back of the missile relative to the target and transmits appropriate commands to the missile via a thin wire that trails behind the missile. The system has an alarm that activates when it detects jamming from a system like Shtora. The operator can then take manual control, reducing the missile to MCLOS. The SACLOS guidance system has many benefits over MCLOS. The system's accuracy is quoted in some sources as 90%, though its performance is probably comparable to the BGM-71 TOW or later SACLOS versions of the 9K11 Malyutka.

Based on the play Fly Away Home by Dorothy Bennett and Irving White, the film was directed by Michael Curtiz. It was released by Warner Bros. on June 23, 1939. Plot Freewheeling Jim Masters returns home after a 20-year absence, during which he was declared dead, to find that his wife, Nancy, is about to marry Sam Sloane, a stable local man in Carmel, California. She must now choose between her ex-husband and her new fianc√©. The Masters daughters are also upset that their irresponsible father has re- entered their lives after so long an absence. Meanwhile, the youngest daughter, Buff, is drawn to tough-guy Gabriel Lopez, a man that reminds Jim Masters of himself.

However, the storyline of Four Daughters and the Lemp family is continued in the 1939 film Four Wives, and 1941's Four Mothers. Reception Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times called the film \\" a thoroughly pleasant entertainment‚Äîhowbeit reminiscent‚Äîwith a thoroughly pleasant cast to grace it.\\" Variety wrote: \\"Few of the situations can stand up under too close scrutiny, but the flavor of the film as a whole is entertaining, amusing, and occasionally emotional.\\" Harrison's Reports called it \\"Good entertainment ... Although it is not as impressive as 'Four Daughters,' it nevertheless holds one's attention well, since one is in sympathy with all the characters.\\" Film Daily called it \\"A production with a high voltage of sentimental of romantic appeal\\" with a \\"super-duper\\" cast. John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote that Garfield added \\"a touch of color or adventuresome liveliness\\" to help along the story, but found \\"a quantity of bungalow patter that wears one down at times\\" and \\"a slight dullness\\" to the picture. Home media Warner Archive released the film on DVD in August 1, 2011. The film was also released by Warner Archive in the \\"Four Daughters Movie Series Collection\\".

Initially a continuation of Jefferson Starship, it underwent a change in musical direction, the subsequent loss of personnel, and a lawsuit settlement that led to a name change. They had three number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in addition to two gold or platinum selling albums. History In June 1984, Paul Kantner, the last remaining founding member of Jefferson Airplane, left Jefferson Starship. In October 1984, Kantner took legal action over the Jefferson Starship name against his former bandmates. In March 1985, Kantner settled out of court and signed an agreement that neither party would use the names \\"Jefferson\\" or \\"Airplane\\" unless all members of Jefferson Airplane Inc. (Bill Thompson, Paul Kantner, Grace Slick, Jorma Kaukonen, Jack Casady) agreed. The band briefly performed as \\"Starship Jefferson\\" while legal proceedings occurred, before settling on the shortened name \\"Starship\\". David Freiberg stayed with the band after the lawsuit and attended the first studio sessions for the next album. He became frustrated with the sessions because all the keyboard work in the studio was being done by Peter Wolf (who had played on the sessions for Nuclear Furniture and briefly joined the band on the road for the follow-up tour) and that was the instrument Freiberg was supposed to be playing. Freiberg was dismissed from the band in 1985. The next album was finished with the five remaining members, consisting of Slick, co-lead singer Mickey Thomas, guitarist Craig Chaqui√ßo, bassist Pete Sears, and drummer Donny Baldwin. In 1984, Gabriel Katona (who had previously played in Rare Earth and Player) joined the band to play keyboards and saxophone on the road with them through to the end of the 1986 tour. 175x175pxThe next album, Knee Deep in the Hoopla was released in September 1985 and scored two number-one hits. The first was \\"We Built This City\\", written by Bernie Taupin, Martin Page, Dennis Lambert, and Peter Wolf and was engineered by Grammy-winning producer Bill Bottrell and arranged by Bottrell and Jasun Martz; the second was \\"Sara\\". The album itself reached No. 7, went platinum, and spawned two more singles: \\"Tomorrow Doesn't Matter Tonight\\" (#26), and \\"Before I Go\\" (#68). The band had not had a number- one hit record since previous incarnation Jefferson Starship released Red Octopus in 1975.223x223pxIn 1986, the group recorded \\"Cut You Down to Size\\" for the film Youngblood. By the time the sessions for No Protection began, bassist Pete Sears had left the band. Sears went on to play keyboards with former Jefferson Airplane members Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady in Hot Tuna for ten years. In early 1987, \\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\\", recorded while Sears was still with the band, appeared in the film Mannequin and hit No. 1. At that time, the song made Slick the oldest female vocalist to sing on a number-one Billboard Hot 100 hit, at the age of 47 (she held this record until Cher broke it at the age of 52, in 1999 with \\"Believe\\"). No Protection was released in 1987, and also featured the singles \\"It's Not Over ('Til It's Over)\\" (#9), and \\"Beat Patrol\\" (#46). \\"Wild Again\\" (which reached No. 73 on the Billboard singles chart) was also used in the film Cocktail. The last song on the album, \\"Set the Night to Music\\", would later become a hit in 1991, re- recorded as a duet by Roberta Flack and Maxi Priest. Following the completion of the album sessions in 1987, Brett Bloomfield was brought in to replace Sears and Mark Morgan joined the band on keyboards. Slick left Starship in February 1988, going on to join the reformed Jefferson Airplane for an album and tour in 1989, before retiring from music. As Kantner, Sears and Freiberg had left the band, all the new and remaining members were more than a decade younger than she was. Slick has been quoted as saying that \\"old people don't belong on a rock and roll stage\\".\\"Jefferson Airplane\\". Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, Centennial Edition. Nicolas Slonimsky, Editor Emeritus. Schirmer, 2001. With Thomas the sole lead singer, the revamped lineup released Love Among the Cannibals in August 1989 and went on another tour to support the album; recruiting backing singers Christina Marie Saxton and Melisa Kary to fill the gap left by Slick's departure. On September 24, 1989, while the band was in Scranton, Pennsylvania for a show, Baldwin and Thomas got into a violent altercation during which Thomas was seriously injured and required facial surgery, and two titanium plates implanted in his skull. Baldwin resigned from the band immediately afterward. The remainder of the tour was postponed until Thomas had recovered and was able to tour again. After Thomas was well enough to tour, the band continued to tour in support of Cannibals. Kenny Stavropoulos was recruited to be the band's new drummer. After the Cannibals tour wound up in 1990, Chaquico, the last remaining original Jefferson Starship member, handed in his notice. Thomas attributes the comparative lack of commercial success of the last album to the interruption of the tour, among other factors. Cannibals remains his personal favorite Starship album. Brett Bloomfield, Mark Morgan, and Kenny Stavropoulos also departed the group in 1990. Peter Wolf was added as a member on keyboards at this time. In May 1991, RCA assembled a compilation album, Greatest Hits (Ten Years and Change 1979-1991). The collection also included two new tracks, \\"Don't Lose Any Sleep\\" with Thomas and Chaquico (recorded before Chaquico had left) and \\"Good Heart\\" (#81) with Thomas, Wolf, and session musicians. A third track originally recorded during this time period, \\"Keys to the City\\", was released in October 2012 on the album Playlist: The Very Best of Starship. Shortly after the release of the 1991 greatest hits album, manager Bill Thompson decided to fire the group and told RCA that the band was done making records. The band was let go by RCA. Starship became inactive. = Starship featuring Mickey Thomas = Starship featuring Mickey Thomas - 2010 In early 1992, Thomas revived Starship as \\"Mickey Thomas' Starship\\" before changing the name to Starship featuring Mickey Thomas, which has toured steadily ever since. Although Thomas has been supplemented by a mostly new cast of performers, bassist Brett Bloomfield did return to the fold for several years. Melisa Kary and Christina Marie Saxton, who had both performed with the group as backing singers on tour in 1989 through 1990, also had stints as full band members in Starship featuring Mickey Thomas. Darrell Verdusco, formerly of KBC Band, has served as drummer since 1995. Keyboard player Phil Bennett also joined in 1995. The band recorded the album Live at Stanley Cup in 1997. Jeff Adams came aboard on bass in 2000. In 2003, Starship featuring Mickey Thomas released a DVD documentary Starship: Greatest & Latest. The album accompanying this release contained re-recordings by Starship featuring Mickey Thomas of some of the Starship's biggest hits, songs originally from the period of Thomas's tenure in Jefferson Starship, as well as \\"Fooled Around and Fell in Love\\", which Thomas sang with the Elvin Bishop Group in 1976. Female vocalist Stephanie Calvert joined the band in 2006. A live album, Layin' it on the Line Live in Las Vegas was released in 2007. Starship featuring Mickey Thomas released the non-album single \\"Get Out Again\\" in 2007. A new Starship album, Loveless Fascination, produced by Jeff Pilson of Foreigner, was released on September 17, 2013. The band performed at the Streamy Awards on September 8, 2014. The non-album single \\"My Woman\\" was released in 2016. On February 1, 2019, Rhino Entertainment acquired the rights to the Starship catalog for all the albums released between 1985 and 1991. Former Starship trumpet player Max Haskett, who performed with the band from their reformation in 1992 until the following year, died in 1999 as a result of pancreatic cancer. Lead guitarist Erik Torjesen, who performed with the band between 1996 and 2000, died of cancer, aged 34, in 2001. Torjesen's replacement, Mark Abrahamian, died from a heart attack, aged 46, following a concert on September 2, 2012. Abrahamian was replaced as guitarist by John Roth.

Movie World in Queensland, Australia. The story takes place in a dystopian future. The main character in the movie, John Henry Brennick (Christopher Lambert) and his wife Karen B. Brennick (Loryn Locklin) are sent to a maximum security prison because they are expecting a second child, which is against strict one-child policies. The film was a financial success, but critical reviews were mixed. A sequel, Fortress 2: Re-Entry, was released in 2000, with Lambert reprising his role. Plot In a dystopian 2017, ex-army officer John Henry Brennick and his wife Karen are attempting to cross the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border to Vancouver to have a second child. Strict one-child policies forbid a second pregnancy, even after their firstborn has died, so Karen wears a magnetic vest to trick the security scanners. A guard notices and raises the alarm. Brennick is caught, believing Karen to have escaped, and sentenced to 31 years at the Fortress, a private maximum security prison run by the Men-Tel Corporation. To maintain discipline all inmates are implanted with \\"Intestinators\\" which induce severe pain or death as a form of physical control and mental conditioning. The prison is co- run by Director Poe, who oversees Zed-10, a computer that monitors day-to-day activities. The prison is located underground, in the middle of the desert, inside a deep pit that can only be crossed by a retractable bridge, while the prisoners are kept in overcrowded cells secured by laser walls. John is imprisoned with inmates Abraham, a model prisoner who works as Poe's manservant and is awaiting parole; D-Day, a machine and demolitions expert; Nino Gomez and Stiggs, who tries to extort John. John learns his wife has been captured and is held in another level with his unborn child who, being illegal, is now officially owned by Men-Tel and will be confiscated at birth. Stiggs has a friend, Maddox, who intimidates John and the two are involved in a brawl which culminates with Maddox being shot by a security turret. John manages to grab Maddox's Intestinator and gives it to D-Day before he is taken away to be subjected to a mind-wipe procedure as punishment. Poe, infatuated with Karen, tells her that if she lives with him he will treat John well and release him from the mind-wipe chamber. She accepts to help John. Poe is revealed to be a cyborg, powerfully enhanced by Men-Tel cybernetics. Four months later, a heavily pregnant Karen manages to use her access to the prison computer in Poe's quarters to help John by restoring him from his mind-wiped state. Karen steals a holographic map and gives it to Abraham to give to John. D-Day dismantles Maddox's Intestinator and uses a magnetic component to pull out the others' Intestinators. During their next work shift John's group puts their Intestinators in an air-duct and stage a brawl, causing Zed to trigger the devices and blow the duct open to prepare their escape. Poe promptly flushes the duct with steam and sends in \\"Strike Clones\\", networked cyborgs armed with flamethrowers and machine guns. Stiggs surrenders and gets shot dead, but the rest of the group kill a Strike Clone, steal its weapon and use it to kill the remaining clones. Zed alerts Poe of Karen's actions. He reveals to her that her child, like all MenTel-owned babies, will be extracted in a fatal Caesarean to be made a cyborg. Abraham and Karen resist, but are powerless against the cyborg Poe and Abraham dies of strangulation. Hijacking one of the gun turrets and using it as an elevator, John's group travels to Zed's control room. John takes Poe hostage and orders him to release Karen. Poe gives the order, but Zed refuses the command while stating that MenTel does not engage in any negotiations during hostage situations and a gun turret blasts Poe, blowing him to pieces and leaving John's group with no leverage. Once brought over to the core computer, D-Day hacks into Zed and accesses a powerful virus confiscated at the start of his sentence. D-Day manages to activate the virus after being shot and incapacited, causing a complete systems crash and all automated security to fail. John and Gomez rescue Karen, hijack a truck, and escape to Mexico where Karen enters labor in an abandoned barn and gives birth to her and John's child. Original ending The original ending of Fortress has been edited from some versions of the film. After reaching Mexico, Brennick, his wife, and Gomez end up at a barn where she starts going into labor. Gomez goes out to the truck to get a blanket for the soon-to-arrive baby. The Fortress computer manages to establish a remote linkup with the truck, overriding its internal controls. The truck suddenly comes to life and runs Gomez down, killing him. Brennick shoots the truck with the Strike Clone machine gun. He then sets it on fire with the flamethrower attachment. The truck crashes into the barn, exploding. Brennick climbs into the burning ruins to find his wife sitting against an old tractor, clutching her newborn baby. Cast *Christopher Lambert as John Henry Brennick *Loryn Locklin as Karen B.

Stephen Holden of The New York Times said: \\"Like so many other futuristic movies, Fortress is a lot better at setting up its premise than in developing a story around it, [but] for all its faults, [it] has an unusually energetic imagination. At its best, it blends RoboCop, The Handmaid's Tale, and Brave New World into something scary, original and grimly amusing.\\"Fortress review, Stephen Holden, The New York Times, 4 September 1993 Nathan Shumate of Cold Fusion Video Reviews said: \\"It‚Äôs a good little film, kept very interesting by a multitude of plot twists. [...] The beauty of this movie is that it‚Äôs not terribly ambitious; [director Stuart] Gordon knew that it was not meant to be this generation‚Äôs defining science fiction film, and so instead had fun with it. The characters are colorful and engaging, and the actors are b-movie all-stars; the story moves along at a fair clip; and the prison itself is a novel setting, with plenty of inconsistencies in future technology but none that sit up and insist that you notice them.\\"Fortress review, Cold Fusion Video Reviews James Berardinelli of ReelViews said: \\"Fortress has [...] an impressive visual style, [...] the set design is excellent, and the action scenes are well-paced, [but it's] hampered by a poorly-constructed story line [and] never gets on track. Instead of entering the rarefied atmosphere inhabited by such films as Aliens and the original Terminator, it falls in line with the likes of Freejack and Alien 3.\\" Box office Fortress grossed $2,855,154 at the box office in Australia. Internationally it grossed 40 million dollars, turning into a very profitable movie for having been shot with a budget of $12,000,000. Home media Fortress was released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1994 by Live Home Video, and re- released along with the DVD in 1999 by Artisan Entertainment. Columbia TriStar also released the film on VHS, Laserdisc and DVD in some other territories in 1993-2004. The film also released on DVD with Full Uncut Editions in UK and Germany.

The park is bordered by Ocean Avenue to the north and Baxter Boulevard to the south. The offices of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland are located across from the park on Ocean Avenue. History It is named for Edward Payson, which was the name of two prominent residents of the same name. Rev. Edward Payson (1783-1827) was a prominent Congregationalist preacher. His son of the same name (1813-1890) who lived near the park in the Payson House.Writers Program (Maine).

Traditionally, the tobacco industry markets cigarette smoking, but it is increasingly marketing other products, such as electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products. Products are marketed through social media, stealth marketing, mass media, and sponsorship (particularly of sporting events). Expenditures on nicotine marketing are in the tens of billions a year; in the US alone, spending was over US$1 million per hour in 2016; in 2003, per-capita marketing spending was $290 per adult smoker, or $45 per inhabitant. Nicotine marketing is increasingly regulated; some forms of nicotine advertising are banned in many countries. The World Health Organization recommends a complete tobacco advertising ban.  Effects  Though advertisements for cigarettes are banned in many countries, such advertising could still be seen in the sponsorship of events such as auto racing. The effectiveness of tobacco marketing in increasing consumption of tobacco products is widely documented. Advertisements cause new people to become addicted, mostly when they are minors. Ads also keep established smokers from quitting. Advertising peaks in January, when the most people are trying to quit, although the most people take up smoking in the summer. Tobacco shop in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland in 2020: advertisement is authorized inside the shop The tobacco industry has frequently claimed that ads are only about \\"brand preference\\", encouraging existing smokers to switch to and stick to their brand. There is, however, substantial evidence that ads cause people to become, and stay, addicted. Marketing is also used to oppose regulation of nicotine marketing and other tobacco control measures, both directly and indirectly, for instance by improving the image of the nicotine industry and reducing criticism from youth and community groups. Industry charity and sports sponsorships are publicized (with publicity costing up to ten times the cost of the publicized act), portraying the industry as actively sharing the values of the target audience. Marketing is also used to normalize the industry (\\"Just Another Fortune 500 Company\\", \\"More Than a Tobacco Company\\"). Finally, marketing is used to give the impression that nicotine companies are responsible, \\"Open and Honest\\". This is done through an emphasis on informed choice and \\"anti-teen-smoking\\" campaigns, although such ads have been criticized as counterproductive (causing more smoking) by independent groups. Magazines, but not newspapers, that get revenue from nicotine advertising are less likely to run stories critical of nicotine products. Internal documents also show that the industry used its influence with the media to shape coverage of news, such as a decision not to mandate health warnings on cigarette packages or a debate over advertising restrictions. Counter-marketing is also used, mostly by public health groups and governments. The addictiveness and health effects of nicotine use are generally described, as these are the themes missing from pro-tobacco marketing. =Regulation and evasion techniques= Tobacco distributor in Belgium after the introduction of plain packaging (April 2020) Because it harms public health, nicotine marketing is increasingly regulated. Advertising restrictions typically shift marketing spending to unrestricted media. Banned on television, ads move to print; banned in all conventional media, ads shift to sponsorships; banned as in-store advertising and packaging, advertising shifts to shill (undisclosed) marketing reps, sponsored online content, viral marketing, and other stealth marketing techniques. Unlike conventional advertising, stealth marketing is not openly attributed to the organization behind it. This neutralizes mistrust of tobacco companies, which is widespread among children and the teenagers who provide the industry with most new addicts. Another method of evading restrictions is to sell less- regulated nicotine products instead of the ones for which advertising is more regulated. For instance, while TV ads of cigarettes are banned in the United States, similar TV ads of e-cigarettes are not. The most effective media are usually banned first, meaning advertisers need to spend more money to addict the same number of people. Comprehensive bans can make it impossible to effectively substitute other forms of advertising, leading to actual falls in consumption. However, skillful use of allowed media can increase advertising exposure; the exposure of U.S. children to nicotine advertising is increasing as of 2018.  Methods  One of the Find Your Voice ads used by Virginia Slims in 1999 that drew attention due to its rebellious advertising aimed at women. Its tagline reads \\"NEVER let the goody two shoes get you down\\". Nicotine advertising uses specific techniques, but often uses multiple methods simultaneously. For instance, the ad illustrated in this section uses many of the techniques discussed below. Its tagline reads \\"NEVER let the goody two shoes get you down\\",1999 advertisement, in the collection of Stanford Research Into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising making use of reactance; it has also been described as urging smokers to disregard health warnings. The model's gesture echoes earlier ads which made more explicit claims of voice box benefits.Classic vs. modern ad comparison, Stanford Research Into the Impact of Tobacco Advertising ad database. The 1999-2000 \\"Find your voice\\" ad campaign, of which this ad was a part, was criticized as offensive to smokers who have lost their voices to throat cancer, and as targeting minority women and seeking to associate itself with empowerment, independence, self- expression, women's rights, and sexual allure. American spirits sales promotion advertisement inside a shop in Japan =Rebellion= Nicotine marketing makes extensive use of reactance, the feeling that one is being unreasonably controlled. Reactance often motivates rebellion, in behaviour or belief, which demonstrates that the control was ineffective, restoring the feeling of freedom. Ads thus rarely explicitly tell the viewer to use nicotine; this has been shown to be counter-productive. Instead, they frequently suggest using nicotine as a way to rebel and be free. This marketing message is at odds with the feelings of smokers, who commonly feel trapped by their addiction and unable to quit. Mention of addiction is avoided in nicotine advertising. Reactance can be eliminated by successfully concealing attempts to manipulate or control behaviour. Unlike conventional advertising, stealth marketing is not openly attributed to the organization behind it. This neutralizes mistrust of tobacco companies, which is widespread among children and the teenagers who provide the industry with most new addicts. The internet and social media are particularly suited to stealth and viral marketing, which is also cheap; nicotine companies now spend tens of millions per year on online marketing. Counter-advertising also shows awareness of reactance; it rarely tells the viewer what to do. More commonly, it cites statistics about addictiveness and other health effects. Some anti- smoking ads dramatise the statistics (e.g. by piling 1200 body bags in front of the New York headquarters of Philip Morris, now Altria, to illustrate the number of people dying daily from smoking); others document individual experiences. Providing information does not generally provoke reactance. =Social conformity= Advertisement featuring Joe Dimaggio in 1941 Despite products being marketed as individualistic and non-conformist, people generally actually start using due to peer pressure. Being offered a cigarette is one of the largest risk factors for smoking. Boys with a high degree of social conformity are also more likely to start smoking. Social pressure is deliberately used in marketing, often using stealth marketing techniques to avoid triggering reactance. \\"Roachers\\", selected for good looks, style, charm, and being slightly older than the targets, are hired to offer samples of the product. \\"Hipsters\\" are also recruited clandestinely from the bar and nightclub scene to sell cigarettes, and ads are placed in alternative media publications with \\"hip credibility\\". Other strategies include sponsoring bands and seeking to give an impression of usage by scattering empty cigarette packages. Ads also use the threat of social isolation, implied or explicit (e.g. \\"Nobody likes a quitter\\").Source for example quote is an ad for blu e-cigarettes, accessible at: Great care is taken to maintain the impression that a brand is popular and growing in popularity, and that people who smoke the brand are popular Billboard in Denver promoting Old Gold cigarettes (May 1972) Marketing seeks to create a desirable identity as a user, or a user of a specific brand. It seeks to associate nicotine use with rising social identities (see, for instance, the illustrating ad, and history of nicotine marketing in the woman's and civil rights movements, and its use of western affluence in the developing world, below). It seeks to associate nicotine use with positive traits, such as intelligence, fun, sexiness, sociability, high social status, wealth, health, athleticism, and pleasant outdoor pursuits. Many of these associations are fairly implausible; smoking is not generally considered an intelligent choice, even by smokers; most smokers feel miserable about smoking, smoking causes impotence, many smokers feel socially stigmatized for smoking, and smoking is expensive and unhealthy. Marketing also uses associations with loyalty, which not only defend a brand, but put a positive spin on not quitting. A successful campaign playing on loyalty and identity was the \\"rather fight than switch\\" campaign, in which the makeup the models wore made it seem as if they had black eyes, by implication from a fight with smokers of other cigarettes (campaign by a subsidiary of American Tobacco Company, now owned by British American Tobacco). =Mood changes= Nicotine is also advertised as good for \\"nerves\\", irritability, and stress. Again, ads have moved from explicit claims (\\"Never gets on your nerves\\") to implicit claims (\\"Slow down. Pleasure up\\"). Although nicotine products temporarily relieve nicotine withdrawal symptoms, an addiction causes worse stress and mood, due to mild withdrawal symptoms between hits. Nicotine addicts need the nicotine to temporarily feel normal. Nicotine addiction seems to worsen mental health problems, but industry marketing has claimed that nicotine is both less harmful and therapeutic for people with mental illness, and is a form of \\"self-medication\\". Marketing has also claimed that quitting will worsen rather than improve mental health symptoms. These claims have been criticised by independent researchers as inaccurate. It is thought that nicotine withdrawal is worse for those who are already stressed or depressed, making quitting more difficult. About 40% of the cigarettes sold in the U.S. are smoked by people with mental health issues. Smoking rates in the U.S. military were also high, and over a third started smoking after entering the military; deployment was also a risk factor. Disabled people are more likely to smoke; smoking causes disability, but the stress of disability might also cause smoking. According to the CDC Tobacco Product Use Among Adults 2015 report, people who are American Indian/Alaska Native, non-Hispanic, less- educated (0‚Äì12 years education; no diploma, or General Educational Development), lower-income (annual household income <$35,000), Lesbian, gay, or bisexual, the uninsured, and those under serious psychological distress have the highest reported percentage of any tobacco product use. Poorer people also smoke more. When marketing cigarettes to the developing world, tobacco companies associate their product with an affluent Western lifestyle. However, in the developed world, smoking has almost vanished among the affluent. Smoking rates among the American poor are much higher than among the rich, with rates of over 40% for those with a high school equivalency diploma. These differences have been attributed to both lack of healthcare and to selective marketing to socio-economic, racial, and sexual minorities. The tobacco industry targeted young rural men by creating advertisements with images of cowboys, hunters, and race car drivers. Teens in rural areas are less likely to be exposed to anti-tobacco messages in the media. Low-income and predominantly minority neighborhoods often have more tobacco retailers and more tobacco advertising than other neighborhoods. The tobacco industry focusses marketing towards vulnerable groups, contributing to the large disparity in smoking and health problems. The tobacco industry has marketed heavily to African Americans, sexual minorities, and even the homeless and the mentally ill. In 1995, Project SCUM, which targeted sexual and racial minorities and homeless people in San Francisco, was planned by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (a British American Tobacco subsidiary). Tobacco companies have often been progressive in their hiring policies, employing women and blacks when this was controversial. They also donate some of their profits to a variety of organisations that help people in need. =Non-addictiveness and healthiness= Reference to the addictiveness of nicotine is avoided in marketing. Indeed, the addictiveness of nicotine was explicitly denied into the nineties; in 1994, seven tobacco executives stated that nicotine was not addictive while on oath before the US Congress. Industry feared that, if continuing to smoke was not seen as a \\"free choice\\", they would be exposed to legal and social liabilities. The nicotine industry frequently markets its products as healthy, safe, and harmless; it has even marketed them as beneficial to health. These marketing messages were initially explicit, but over the decades, they became more implicit and indirect. Explicitly claiming something that the consumer knows to be untrue tend to make them distrust and reject the message, so the effectiveness of explicit claims dropped as evidence of the harms of cigarettes became more widely known. Explicit claims also have the disadvantage that they remind smokers of the health harms of the product. Implicit claims include slogans with connotations of health and vitality, such as \\"Alive with pleasure\\", and imagery (of instance, images of athletic, healthy people, the presence of healthy children, healthy natural environments, and medical settings). \\"Modified risk\\" products \\"Modified risk\\" nicotine products, alternate nicotine products that are implied to be less harmful, are an old strategy. These products are used to discourage quitting, by offering unwilling smokers an alternative to quitting, and implying that using the alternate product will reduce the hazards of smoking. \\"Modified risk\\" products also attract new smokers. Many \\"modified risk\\" nicotine products are actually just as risky as the products they were marketed against. As the long-term harms of cigarette smoking emerge after ~20 years of use, claims of reduced long-term harms for a new product cannot immediately be refuted. Products may become popular on the basis of false health claims before the research is done that proves them false. Explicit claims of health benefits carry legal risks. They may also require regulatory pre-approval. Reduced levels of specific harmful chemicals are often advertised; people tend to wrongly interpret these as claims of reduced harm. To imply that some nicotine products are healthier than others without making explicit claims, marketing has used descriptions like \\"light\\", \\"mild\\", \\"natural\\", \\"gentle\\", \\"calm\\", \\"soft\\", and \\"smooth\\". Both adults and youth have been shown to misinterpret marketing claims about changes in risk. They falsely interpret them as meaning that the product is safe. They are more likely to start using it, and less likely to quit, as a result. =\\"Mild\\" and \\"roasted\\" cigarettes= In the 1920s to 1950s, ads often focused on throat irritation and coughs, claiming that specific brands were better. This also distracted from the more serious harms of smoking, which were being revealed by research at the time. Claims were made that toasting tobacco removed irritants (which were said to have been sold on to chemical companies). =Menthol cigarettes= Menthol cigarettes have also been marketed as healthier from the 1930s onwards. They were even inaccurately advertised as medicinal, a treatment for smokers that would sooth a throat irritated by smoking, or as a treatment for a cold. Where this is illegal, they are marketed as healthier by implication, using words like \\"mild\\", \\"natural\\", \\"gentle\\", \\"calm\\", \\"soft\\", \\"smooth\\", and imagery of healthy natural environments. There is no evidence that menthol cigarettes are healthier, but there is evidence that they are somewhat easier to become addicted to and harder to quit. =Filter cigarettes= In the fifties, filters were added to cigarettes, and heavily marketed, until they faced regulatory action as false advertising. Initially, efforts were made to develop filters that actually reduced harms; as it became obvious that this was not economically possible, filters were instead designed to turn brown with use. =Ventilated (\\"light\\") cigarettes= Ventilated cigarettes (marketed as \\"light\\", \\"low-tar\\", \\"low-nicotine\\" etc.) do feel cooler, airier, and less harsh, and a smoking machine will give lower tar and nicotine readings for them. But they do not actually reduce human intake or health risks, as a human responds to the lower resistance to breathing through them by taking bigger puffs. They were also designed to be equally addictive, as manufacturers did not want to lose customers. They were introduced in the 1970s, responding to regulation requiring that nicotine and tar yields be included in cigarette ads. Light cigarettes became so popular that, as of 2004, half of American smokers preferred them over regular cigarettes,Light but just as deadly, by Peter Lavelle. The Pulse, 21 October 2004. According to the US federal government's National Cancer Institute (NCI), light cigarettes provide no benefit to smokers' health.The Truth About \\"Light\\" Cigarettes: Questions and Answers, from the National Cancer Institute factsheet'Safer' cigarette myth goes up in smoke, by Andy Coghlan. New Scientist, 2004 However, people using \\"light\\" cigarettes are less likely to quit. =Heated tobacco products= Heated tobacco products, presented as heat-not-burn products, are marketed as less harmful than regular cigarettes since 1988. There is no reliable evidence that these products are any less harmful than regular cigarettes. A reduced harm from using these products has not been proven. These products are marketed as a \\"smoke-free\\" alternative to regular cigarettes. These products do generate smoke. Companies are using similar strategies and channels as previously used for traditional cigarettes. =Electronic cigarettes= A 2014 review said, \\"the e-cigarette companies have been rapidly expanding using aggressive marketing messages similar to those used to promote cigarettes in the 1950s and 1960s.\\" Unsupported claims on safety and quitting smoking are made. Common marketing messages on brand websites, claiming that e-cigarettes are safe and healthy, have been described as \\"concerning\\". It is commonly claimed that e-cigarettes emit merely \\"harmless water vapor\\", which is not the case. E-cigarette e-liquids marketed as \\"nicotine-free\\" have been found to contain nicotine.  Targets  =Unwilling smokers: customer retention= On average, smokers start as adolescents and make over 30 quit attempts, at a rate of about 1 per year, before breaking a nicotine addiction in their 40s or 50s. Most say they feel addicted, and feel misery and disgust at their inability to quit (in surveys, 71-91% regret having started, over 80% intend to quit, around 15% plan to quit within the next month). The industry calls this group \\"concerned smokers\\" and seeks to retain them as customers. Techniques for lowering their quit rate include dissuading them from wanting to quit and offering them meaningless product choices which help them feel in control of their habit. For instance, downplaying the risks, and encouraging them to take pride in smoking as an identity, reduces desire to quit. Suggesting that addicts can reduce their risk by choosing to switch to another product (branded to suggest that it is less harmful or addictive) can reduce their cognitive dissonance and sense of lack of control, without offering a health improvement. Switching to a product branded to suggest that it is less harmful or addictive (\\"mild\\", \\"light\\", \\"low-tar\\", \\"filtered\\" etc.) is, in terms of health effects, meaningless. = Youth: new customers = Marlboro shirt in the 1980s. Owning and being willing to use promotional items is a significant risk factor for nicotine addiction. Smokers typically start young, often as teenagers. As a result, much cigarette advertising is intended to target youth, and depicts young people smoking and using tobacco as a form of leisure and enjoyment. The tobacco industry has targeted youth as young as eight years of age in India. Before 2009, many tobacco companies made flavored tobacco packaged often in colorful candy like wrappers to attract new users, many of which were a younger audience. However these flavored cigarettes were banned in the United States on September 22, 2009 by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. Despite this initiative, flavored cigarettes are still on the rise because tobacco companies change their products slightly so they are filtered or slim cigarettes, which are not banned by the act. Chemical additives and physical design have also been used to make \\"starter products\\" aimed at youth feel smoother and less irritating, part of efforts to make cigarettes addict more quickly, strongly, and reliably. Cigarettes in a Pok√©mon-cartoon-branded claw crane arcade game in 2008 in Jaffa, Israel. The intended audience of tobacco advertising has changed throughout the years, with some brands specifically targeted towards a particular demographic. According to Reynolds American Inc, the Joe Camel campaign in the United States was created to advertise Camel brand to young adult smokers. Class action plaintiffs and politicians described the Joe Camel images as a \\"cartoon\\" intended to advertise the product to people below the legal smoking age. Under pressure from various anti-smoking groups, the Federal Trade Commission, and the U.S. Congress, Camel ended the campaign on 10 July 1997. Vending machines, individually sold single cigarettes, and product displays near schools, next to candy and sweet drinks, and at the eye- level of young children are all used around the world to sell nicotine- containing products. Even large brands are frequently advertised in ways that break local regulations. In many countries, such marketing methods are not illegal. Where they are illegal, enforcement is often a problem. For instance, Dr. Suresh Kumar Arora, New Delhi's chief tobacco control officer, said: \\"We were wasting our time fining cigarette vendors and distributors. They had no idea of the law. Most are illiterate. Our teams would tear down posters and in no time, they would be up again because the real culprits were the big tobacco companies ‚Äì ITC, Philip Morris (now Altria), Godfrey Phillip. I told them to stop giving posters to their dealers otherwise I would drag them through the courts. Since last May, Delhi has been free of tobacco posters, 100% free\\". He has, however, been unable to keep mobile vendors from illegally selling cigarettes next to schools. Easily circumvented age verification at company websites enables minors to access and be exposed to marketing for e-cigarettes. Tobacco businesses intensely market e-cigarettes to youth using cartoon characters and candy flavors. E-cigarettes are also marketed on Facebook, where age restrictions are in many cases not implemented.  \\"Harm reduction\\" advertising  Some tobacco companies have sponsored ads that claim to discourage teen smoking. Such ads are unregulated. However, these ads have been shown, in independent studies, to increase the self-reported likelihood that teens will start smoking. They also cause adults to see tobacco companies as more responsible and less in need of regulation. Unlike promotional ads, tobacco companies do not track the effects of these ads themselves. These ads differ from independently produced antismoking ads in that they do not mention the health effects of smoking, and present smoking as exclusively an \\"adult choice\\", undesirable \\"if you're a teen\\". There is more exposure to industry-sponsored \\"antismoking\\" ads than to antismoking ads run by public health agencies. Tobacco companies have also funded \\"anti-smoking\\" groups. One such organization, funded by Lorillard, enters into exclusive sponsorship agreements with sports organisations. This means that no other anti-smoking campaigns are allowed to be involved with the sporting organisation. Such sponsorships have been criticised by health groups. = Recapturing former smokers = Companies have also sought to recapture people who have successfully broken a nicotine dependency. Ex-smokers tend to view these attempts very negatively, and their existence has frequently been denied. Methods discussed in industry documents include price drops, increasing acceptance of smoking by nonsmokers, making products more socially acceptable, and making \\"healthier\\" cigarettes (scare quotes in original). Economics As tobacco companies keep spending money on marketing until it stops being profitable, marginal changes in marketing typically have no measurable effect, but the total amount of marketing has a strong effect. Econometric studies have been done into the endogeneity and other aspects of bans. = Budgets = Tobacco companies have had particularly large budgets for their advertising campaigns. The Federal Trade Commission claimed that cigarette manufacturers spent $8.24 billion on advertising and promotion in 1999, the highest amount ever at that time. The FTC later claimed that in 2005, cigarette companies spent $13.11 billion on advertising and promotion, down from $15.12 billion in 2003, but nearly double what was spent in 1998. The increase, despite restrictions on the advertising in most countries, was an attempt at appealing to a younger audience, including multi-purchase offers and giveaways such as hats and lighters, along with the more traditional store and magazine advertising. Marketing consultants ACNielsen announced that, during the period September 2001 to August 2002, tobacco companies advertising in the UK spent ¬£25 million, excluding sponsorship and indirect advertising, broken down as follows: * ¬£11 million on press advertising * ¬£13.2 million on billboards * ¬£714,550 on radio advertising * ¬£106,253 on direct mail advertising Figures from around that time also estimated that the companies spent ¬£8m a year sponsoring sporting events and teams (excluding Formula One) and a further ¬£70m on Formula One in the UK. The ¬£25 million spent in the UK amounted to approximately US$0.60 per person in 2002. The 15.12 billion spent in the United States in 2003 amounted to more than $45 for every person in the United States, more than $36 million per day, and more than $290 for each U.S. adult smoker. Television and radio e-cigarette advertising in some countries may be indirectly advertising traditional cigarette smoking. A 2014 review said, \\"the e-cigarette companies have been rapidly expanding using aggressive marketing messages similar to those used to promote cigarettes in the 1950s and 1960s.\\" In the US, six large e-cigarette businesses spent $59.3 million on promoting e-cigarettes in 2013. E-cigarettes are increasingly sold by the traditional tobacco multinationals.

It is the capital of Delta State, Nigeria and one of the 3 towns of Oshimili South Local Government Area, A fast developing urban area, Asaba had a population of 149,603 as at the 2006 census, and a metropolitan population of over half a million people. Asaba is well known for social activities due to the presence of large people and social amenities such as hotels, clubs, cinemas, malls, event centre, etc. It holds a yearly program named Delta Yaddah which always host series of gospel singers among others. Due to its large population, crime rate is high. Crimes such as pick pocketing, sideways robbery, etc, is rampart in Asaba. Because of the existence of foreigners in the state, cost of living is high in Asaba. The Onitsha bridge is the boundary between Delta and Anambra state, as the bridge separates Asaba and Onitsha. Etymology Asaba is from the exclamation Ahabam, meaning \\"I have chosen well\\", a quote from the Nnebisi the founding father of Asaba. History The city of Asaba was once the colonial capital of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate. It was founded in 1884.Letters from Nigeria,D.W. Carnegie,BiblioBazaar, LLC, Between 1886 and 1900, it hosted the Royal Niger Company, which the British authorities set up to stimulate trade and the exportation of goods to England. That company has grown today into UAC Nigeria PLC. Scottish explorer William B. Balkie, when signing a trade treaty with Igbo chief Ezebogo in Asaba on August 30, 1885, remarked \\"After our salutations, I spoke of friendship, of trade, and of education, and particularly enlarged upon the evils of war, and the benefits of peace, all of which was well received\\". Owing to Asaba's influential history and geography, and current strategic political and economic influence in Nigeria, Asaba is generally known as the regional capital of the Anioma area. The clamour for creation of Anioma state has been going on for decades. Geography Asaba is situated on a terrace of the lower Niger River, overlooking the point where the Anambra River flows into it. Beyond the river banks, on the high plains which are far more extensive than the river basins, secondary forest vegetation flourishes. The historic Niger River is a trans- African link beginning from West Africa and down into the Atlantic Ocean. Asaba forms a connector between western, eastern and northern Nigeria through the Niger River from the north and via the Asaba Niger Bridge, an east-west link and a Nigerian landmark. Asaba Niger bridge Asaba lies approximately 6 degrees north of the equator and about the same distance east of the meridian; about north of where the River Niger flows into the Atlantic Ocean. The greater Asaba occupies an area of about 300 square kilometers. It maintains an average tropical temperature of 32 ¬∞C during the dry season and an average fertile rainfall of during the rainy season. Greater Asaba includes some of the other neighbouring communities such as Igbuzo, Okpanam, Oko, Okwe and Ugbolu on the western section of the Niger River. Culture Asaba is culturally led by the highly revered Asagba of Asaba, to whom the leaders (individually referred to as the ‚ÄúDiokpa‚Äù) of each of the five settlement quarters (locally identified as Ebos) report directly on matters affecting the community. The Asagba is assisted by the Iyasele of Asaba [Iyase] who is the customary Prime Minister as well as a council of chiefs and elders [Olinzele, Otu Ihaza, Oloto, etc]. Demographics Igbo people constitute sixty-three percent of the total population of Asaba. Since becoming the administrative capital of Delta State, Asaba has grown in population to over half a million people. Today, it maintains a cosmopolitan population of predominantly non- indigenous people. Some of the other groups in the city include Urhobo, Isoko, Ijaw, Hausa, Itsekiri and Yoruba people. Economy Asaba is an administrative area and seat of government established during the time of the Royal Niger Company (now UACN), and is the administrative capital of Delta state. Thus civil service leads the economy and economic activities of the city's inhabitants. The Nigerian government through the administration of Samuel Ogmemudia established the Asaba Textile Mills and a power substation at Asaba. The city of Asaba hosts some pharmaceutical companies that manufacture medicines and there is also a steel mill within the city. Tourism is also attracts revenue into the city, which has resulted to a booming hotel and hospitality business. Sport The Stephen Keshi Stadium at Asaba, which had a face-lift to satisfy local fans, has hosted several international competitions and soccer events since it was upgraded by the administration of Senator Dr. Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa and commissioned by Nigeria's former president Olusegun Obasanjo. The stadium is the home of Delta Force FC. Transport =Air= The city of Asaba and neighbouring cities are accessible by air through the Asaba international airport. =Road= The Asaba-Benin express road is an important road which connects parts of eastern Nigeria with western Nigeria. There is also a road that connects areas of Asaba with Ughelli, while the Asaba-Ebu road connects the city with northern Nigeria. =Water= Asaba is served by water transportation available through the Niger River, which surrounds most parts of the African city.

Although later chroniclers stated he had previously held ecclesiastical office in Canterbury, there is no contemporary evidence of this, and his first appearance in history is when he became archbishop in 833. Ceolnoth faced two problems as archbishop ‚Äì raids and invasions by the Vikings and a new political situation resulting from a change in overlordship from one kingdom to another during the early part of his archiepiscopate. Ceolnoth attempted to solve both problems by coming to an agreement with his new overlords for protection in 838. Ceolnoth's later years in office were marked by more Viking raids and a decline in monastic life in his archbishopric. Archbishop Gervase of Canterbury wrote at the end of the twelfth century that Ceolnoth was Dean of the see of Canterbury previous to being elected to the archiepiscopal see of Canterbury, but this story has no confirmation in contemporary records.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury pp. 143‚Äì145 There is no sign of him being associated with either Canterbury or Kent, the region where Canterbury is located, prior to his elevation as archbishop. Given the length of his archiepiscopate, he was probably a young man when he was elected to Canterbury. Ceolnoth was consecrated archbishop on 27 July 833.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 214 Upon becoming archbishop, Ceolnoth had to deal with two problems ‚Äì first the Viking attacks on his archbishopric and the surrounding lands in Kent and second the newly ascendant kings of Wessex who had just gained control of Kent. Previously, the Mercian kings had ruled Kent. In 836, Ceolnoth presided, with Wiglaf of Mercia, over a council held at Croft attended by the clergy of the southern part of Britain.Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 158 This was the last time that the archbishop worked in concert with a Mercian king as, after this, he was an attendee at the Wessex royal court instead of the Mercian. In 838 a council was held at Kingston upon Thames where Ceolnoth made an alliance with the West Saxon kings Egbert and √Üthelwulf.Wareham \\"Ceolnoth\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography This agreement gave control of all of the free minsters under Canterbury's authority to the king in return for protection from Viking raids.Blair Church in Anglo-Saxon Society p. 124 Ceolnoth also ceded the right to influence the election of abbots within Kent to the king. In return, Egbert received the support of Ceolnoth for the succession of Egbert's son √Üthelwulf as king. When Egbert died shortly after this, √Üthelwulf succeeded his father and became the first son to follow his father as king of Wessex in almost two centuries.Pollard Alfred the Great p. 39 Ceolnoth also recovered control of some lands that had been lost by Canterbury. The end result of this agreement was that the Wessex kings became the secular protectors of the churches and monasteries of the archdiocese of Canterbury. Later life and death During Ceolnoth's archbishopric, monastic life declined under the pressure of the Viking attacks, and there was a noticeable decline in the quality of the books and other works produced by the scriptoriums. A number of monasteries died out under the pressure of the raids by the invaders, who wintered over in Kent in 851 and 855. He held councils in 839 and 845, the second at London.Keynes \\"Ceolnoth\\" Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England During his later years in office, he was assisted by four clerics, who appear to have been or acted as archdeacons, one of the earliest appearances of this office in England.Stenton Anglo-Saxon England p. 440 Ceolnoth is also known to have corresponded with Pope Leo IV.Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 164 Archbishop Ceolnoth died on 4 February 870. Although monastic and secular life suffered during the later part of Ceolnoth's archbishopric, his agreement with Egbert set the foundation for the co-operation between the archbishops of Canterbury and the kings of England in the future.

Instead of being based on stratigraphy, these dates are defined chronometrically. A Siderian banded iron formation in Dales Gorge, Western Australia The deposition of banded iron formations peaked early in this period. These iron rich formations were formed as anaerobic cyanobacteria produced waste oxygen that combined with iron, forming magnetite (Fe3O4, an iron oxide). This process removed iron from the Earth's oceans, presumably turning greenish seas clear. Eventually, with no remaining iron in the oceans to serve as an oxygen sink, the process allowed the buildup of an oxygen-rich atmosphere. This second, follow-on event is known as the oxygen catastrophe, which, some geologists believe triggered the Huronian glaciation. Since the time period from 2420 Ma to 2250 Ma is well-defined by the lower edge of iron-deposition layers, an alternative period named the Oxygenian, based on stratigraphy instead of chronometry, was suggested in 2012 in a geological timescale review.

Conception  The show was originally conceived as a live weekly event for the upstairs venue Le Joke of the Melbourne comedy venue The Last Laugh. Tory McBride, then the associate producer of comedy at the Last Laugh, came up with the concept and the title and in association with comedy director, John Thomson, put together the team which was to become The Blood Group. The show was very loosely scripted and then improvised on stage, with two planned storylines depending on live audience voting. The live Le Joke version, which had a continuous weekly run for about a year, was a success with audience members returning every Thursday evening to see the next episode. Before long, it had become too big for the 100-seat Le Joke theatre, and was moved downstairs for several seasons on the main stage of the Last Laugh. There was also a radio version of the show.  Television Let The Blood Run Free was subsequently picked up for television and 26 episodes were produced using a number of the storylines developed during the stage shows. They aired in Australia from 20 August 1990 to 22 January 1994 and in the UK on Channel 4 from 29 August 1992 to 7 January 1995. The show featured the original cast including Kath & Kim actor Peter Rowsthorn in the early role of hospital orderly Warren Cronkshonk. It is thought to be one of the first interactive television series ever made - in keeping with the live version, at the end of each episode the viewers could vote by telephone to decide the direction the storylines would take. It was also unusual in its lack of respect for television conventions, breaking the fourth wall by turning to the camera and directly addressing the viewers. The stories were as over-the-top as the acting; Pam and Ray discovering they are brother and sister - just after they get married and Pam announces her pregnancy; Effie being run over by St Christopher in a VW campervan and squashed flat, only to be brought back from the dead in Series 2 by Ray and her boyfriend Warren; Matron Dorothy Conniving-Bitch teaming up with her long-lost axe-murdering lover Bill Schwarzenhameneggenberger to destroy Pam and Ray's relationship; the vampire Carla Laboumdier falling for Ray, meanwhile stalking the staff, until her eventual staking by Ray. Both Series 1 and Series 2 are available on DVD in Australia, each season occupying a two-disc set. Characters' names In keeping with the spoof nature of the series each character had a name that was either a pun or extreme. * Nurse Pam Sandwich - who became Pam Good-Sandwich on marrying Ray and Pam Good-Lovechild-Sandwich on marrying Richard - as played by Jean Kittson * Dr. Ray Good as played by Brian Nankervis * Dr. Richard Lovechild as played by David Swann * Matron Dorothy Conniving-Bitch as played by Lynda Gibson * Warren Cronkshonk as played by Peter Rowsthorn, who also played axe-murderer Bill Schwarzenhameneggenberger * Inspector George Slabb - pronounced Slab-ub, because of the double \\"b\\" - as played by Mark Cutler.

Interested in American Indian music, he became associated with the Indianist movement and founded the Wa-Wan Press to publish music in this genre. He combined teaching, composing and conducting in his career, working on both coasts and in Michigan.  Biography  Farwell was born in St Paul, Minnesota. He trained as an engineer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, graduating in 1893. But he turned toward a musical career following contact with Rudolf Gott, an eccentric Boston-based composer. After studying in Boston, Farwell traveled to Europe for additional work, becoming a student of Engelbert Humperdinck in Berlin and Alexandre Guilmant in Paris. Returning to the U.S., he lectured in music at Cornell University from 1899 to 1901. He founded the Wa-Wan Press, dedicated to publishing the works of the American Indianist composers, among whom Farwell was a leading figure. There was great interest in this period in drawing from Native American forms and songs. From 1910 to 1913 Farwell directed municipal concerts in New York City, including massed performances of choral works, some of them his own, by up to 1,000 voices. He directed the Music School Settlement (now Third Street Music School Settlement) in New York from 1915‚Äì18, where his private pupils included the young Roy Harris. During this period he composed the score for Percy MacKaye's \\"Community Masque\\" Caliban by the Yellow Sands. In 1918 Farwell moved to California, assuming the role of Acting Head of the music department at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1918-19, he founded the Santa Barbara Community Chorus, and was first holder of the composer's fellowship of the Music & Art Association of Pasadena (1921‚Äì25). He moved to Michigan, where he taught theory at Michigan State College (1927‚Äì39) (now Michigan State University in East Lansing). Nicolas Slonimsky noted in Baker's Biographical Dictionary that \\"Disillusioned about commercial opportunities for American music, including his own, he established in East Lansing, in April 1936, his own lithographic handpress, with which he printed his own music, handling the entire process of reproduction, including the cover designs, by himself.\\" Farwell eventually returned to New York City, where he settled. His notable students include Roy Harris, Dika Newlin, and Bernard Rogers.  Music and writings  Farwell wrote a copious amount of instrumental, chamber, choral and orchestral music as well as theatre scores, masques and music for community performance. Some of his works reflect his interest in a personal, esoteric form of spirituality. This is also expressed in his lectures and writings on the theme of Intuition. Among his principal compositions are a number of Symbolistic Studies for orchestra, a Symphony developed from a fragmentary opening left by his mentor Rudolph Gott, the large-scale \\"symphonic song ceremony\\" Mountain Song for orchestra and chorus, a string quartet, a piano quintet and many works both vocal and instrumental drawing from the music of Native American peoples. A gradual but ceaseless developer as a composer, in his last couple of decades Farwell produced his most individual works - including a series of polytonal studies for piano, several concise instrumental sonatas, numerous effective and penetrating settings of the poetry of Emily Dickinson, and a satirical opera, Cartoon, which contains extended parodies of Stravinsky and Schoenberg.

The corresponding titles for other MPs were burgess in a borough constituency (or citizen if the borough had city status) and baron for a Cinque Ports constituency. Knights of the shire had more prestige than burgesses, and sitting burgesses often stood for election for the shire in the hope of increasing their standing in Parliament. The name \\"knight of the shire\\" originally implied that the representative had to be a knight, and the writ of election referred to a belted knight until the 19th century; but by the 14th century men who were not knights were commonly elected. An act of Henry VI stipulated that those eligible for election were knights and \\"such notable esquires and gentlemen as have estates sufficient to be knights, and by no means of the degree of yeoman\\".; citing 23 Hen.6 c.15 [recte 14] \\"that the Knights of the Shires for the Parliament hereafter to be chosen, shall be notable Knights of the same Counties for the which they shall (')be chosen, or otherwise such notable Esquires, Gentlemen(') of the same Counties, as shall be able to be Knights ; and no Man to be such Knight which standeth in the Degree of a Yeoman and under.\\" From Simon de Montfort's Parliament in 1265, each shire sent two knights, and the number was standard until 1826 when Yorkshire gained two additional knights after the disfranchisement of Grampound borough. Under the Great Reform Act of 1832 counties with larger populations sent more knights than smaller ones. The Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 split each multiple-seat shire into multiple single-seat divisions. This change, together with the concomitant standardisation of the franchise, means that county and borough constituencies now differ only slightly, as to election expenses and their type of returning officer. The term \\"knight of the shire\\" has been used more recently in a tongue-in-cheek manner for senior Conservative Party backbenchers representing rural constituencies in England and Wales.  Middle Ages  The precursor to the English parliamentary system was a Magnum Concilium or great council, an advice chamber to the king consisting of peers, ecclesiastics, and Knights of the Shire (with the king summoning two of these from each county). In 1264, this council evolved to include representatives from the boroughs (burgesses), requiring that all members be elected (Montfort's Parliament). The parliament gained legislative powers in 1295 (the Model Parliament). In the following century Edward III split parliament into its current bicameral structure, which includes the House of Commons and the House of Lords, in 1341. It opted in 1376 to appoint Sir Peter de la Mare to convey to the Lords complaints about heavy taxes, demands for an accounting of the royal expenditures, and criticism of the king's management of the military. Although de la Mare was imprisoned for his actions, many recognised the value of a single representative voice for the Commons. Accordingly, an office of Speaker of the House of Commons was created. Mare was soon released after the death of Edward III and became the Speaker of the House again in 1377. Until legislation in 1430, the franchise (electorate) for elections of knights of the shire was not restricted to forty shilling freeholders. Discussing the original county franchise, historian Charles Seymour suggested, \\"It is probable that all free inhabitant householders voted and that the parliamentary qualification was, like that which compelled attendance in the county court, merely a 'resiance' or residence qualification.\\" He goes on to explain why Parliament decided to legislate about the county franchise. \\"The Act of 1430,\\" he said, \\"after declaring that elections had been crowded by many persons of low estate, and that confusion had thereby resulted, accordingly enacted that the suffrage should be limited to persons qualified by a freehold of 40s\\". The Parliament of England legislated the new uniform county franchise, in the statute 8 Henry VI, c. 7. However the Chronological Table of the Statutes does not mention such a 1430 Act, as it was included in the Consolidated Statutes as a recital in the Electors of Knights of the Shire Act 1432 (10 Henry VI, c. 2), which amended and re-enacted the 1430 law to make clear that the resident of a county had to have a forty shilling freehold in that county in order to be a voter there. Over the course of time, authorities began to consider a great number of different types of property as forty shilling freeholds. Subsequently, the residence requirement disappeared.  Reform  Until the Great Reform Act of 1832, each county continued to send two Knights (apart from Yorkshire, which had its number of Knights increased to four in 1826). How these knights were chosen varied from one county to the next and evolved over time. The 1832 Act increased the number of Knights sent by some populous counties to as many as six.  Modern usage  The term became obsolete due to the final destruction of counties mentioned by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 and widened structure of electorate in the Reform Act of 1884 (the Third Great Reform Act), and in the Representation of the People Act of 1918. The term rapidly died out during the 20th century in reference to Members of Parliament who represent county constituencies; for they no longer represented a whole county. The term occasionally features as journalese to describe elderly Members of Parliament, usually any Conservative backbenchers with long service who possess a knighthood.

The main ore exploited in those times was native copper from the oxidation zone of the deposit. Later on, iron ores brought about a gradual switch from copper to iron mining. Mining was an activity of the Dacians, the ancient inhabitants of present-day Romania. After the Roman conquest in 106, mining was expanded in the Roman province of Dacia. At Berzovis (present day Berzovia, ten kilometres northwest of Ocna de Fier) a Roman metallurgy school, Schola fabrorum, was established, showing the keen interest the Romans had in metal extraction.

This period is interesting for the first evidence of sexual reproduction. The 1.2 billion years old Hunting Formation on Somerset Island, Canada, dates from the end of the Ectasian. It contains the microfossils of the multicellular filaments of Bangiomorpha pubescens (type of red algae), the first taxonomically resolved eukaryote. This was the first organism that exhibited sexual reproduction, which is an essential feature for complex multicellularity. Complex multicellularity is different from \\"simple\\" multicellularity, such as colonies of organisms living together. True multicellular organisms contain cells that are specialized for different functions. This is, in fact, an essential feature of sexual reproduction as well, since the male and female gametes are specialized cells. Organisms that reproduce sexually must solve the problem of generating an entire organism from just the germ cells. Sexual reproduction and the ability of gametes to develop into an organism are the necessary antecedents to true multicellularity. In fact, we tend to think of sexual reproduction and true multicellularity as occurring at the same time, and true multicellularity is often taken as a marker for sexual reproduction.

The house is open daily to public from May through October (half days on Sundays). An admission fee is charged. History The house has both historical and literary importance, as it is both the oldest standing structure on the Portland peninsula and the childhood home of famous American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807‚Äì1882). American Revolutionary War General Peleg Wadsworth built the house in 1785‚Äì1786, the first wholly brick dwelling in Portland.Haas, Irvin. Historic Homes of American Authors. Washington, DC: The Preservation Press, 1991. . p. 69. Wadsworth raised ten children in the two-story structure with a pitched roof before retiring to the family farm in Hiram, Maine, in 1807. His daughter Zilpah and her husband Stephen Longfellow IV were married in the house. Their son, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, was born nearby at the home of an aunt, Stephen's sister, on February 27, 1807. The home was a three-story Federal architecture-style home at the corner of Fore and Hancock Streets.Calhoun, Charles C. Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life. Boston: Beacon Press, 2004: 5. . Young Longfellow did not move with his parents to the Wadsworth-Longfellow House until he was eight months old, but spent the next 35 years there.Haas, Irvin. Historic Homes of American Authors. Washington, DC: The Preservation Press, 1991. . p. 70. The Longfellows added today's third story in 1815. Preservation Anne Longfellow Pierce (1810‚Äì1901) was the last family member to live in the house. She deliberately kept the house much as it was in Peleg Wadsworth's time, but is perhaps best remembered for growing oranges in the window (no small feat in a Maine winter).Portland Historical Society Her will stipulated that the house, lot, and many furnishings be given to the Maine Historical Society upon her death. Pierce died in 1901 and the Maine Historical Society opened the home to the public within a year. At the time, only one other American author's home was owned by an organization committed to its preservation, specifically the John Greenleaf Whittier Homestead in Haverhill, Massachusetts.Sweeting, Adam W. \\"Preserving the Renaissance: Literature and Publivc Memory in the Homes of Longfellow, Hawthorne, and Poe\\", American Studies. 46:1 (Spring 2005): 23.

The Longfellow Garden Club engaged landscape architect Myron Lamb to design the Colonial Revival style Longfellow Garden located in what was once part of the Longfellow family farmyard. The garden was replanted in 2007 after renovations to Maine Historical Library. A lilac tree mentioned by Anne Longfellow is located in the back corner alongside the library.

The poem is written in blank verse and encompasses nine books (the woman's number, the number of the Sibylline Books). It is a first person narration, from the point of view of Aurora; its other heroine, Marian Erle, is an abused self-taught child of itinerant parents. The poem is set in Florence, Malvern, London and Paris. The author uses her knowledge of Hebrew and Greek, while also playing off modern novels, such as Corinne ou l'Italie by Anne Louise Germaine de Sta√´l and the novels by George Sand. As far as Book 5, Aurora narrates her past, from her childhood to the age of about 27; in Books 6‚Äì9, the narrative has caught up with her, and she reports events in diary form. Elizabeth Barrett Browning styled the poem \\"a novel in verse\\", and referred to it as \\"the most mature of my works, and the one into which my highest convictions upon Life and Art have entered.\\" Scholar Deirdre David asserts that Barrett Browning's work in Aurora Leigh has made her into \\"a major figure in any consideration of the nineteenth-century woman writer and of Victorian poetry in general.\\" John Ruskin called it the greatest long poem of the nineteenth century.Bov√©, Paul A. Early Postmodernism: Foundational Essay. Durham, NC: Duke University, 1995, p. 164. Plot summary =First Book= Aurora describes her childhood in Florence, growing up as the daughter of a Tuscan mother and an English father. Her mother died when she was four, leaving her father to raise her. He was a scholar, and imparted to her knowledge of Greek and Latin and a love of learning. Her father died when she was thirteen, and she was sent to England to live with his sister, her aunt, in Leigh Hall, her family's ancestral home. Her aunt tried to educate her in what she considered a ladylike manner, but Aurora discovered her father's old library and read scholarly books on her own. She read many of Shakespeare's famous works and fell in love with his writing style and aspired to be a great writer like him one day. =Second Book= This book starts on Aurora's twentieth birthday. Her cousin, Romney Leigh, proposes marriage to her. He is skeptical about her poetic ability, telling her that women do not have the passion, intellectual capacity, or redemptive qualities to be true artists. Because of this, and because she feels that he is too wrapped up in his social work and ideals to be a good husband, she angrily rejects him. Aurora's aunt chastises her for refusing him, telling her that because he is the male heir, he will inherit all of the estate and Aurora will be left with nothing. Shortly afterwards, her aunt dies. Romney attempts to give Aurora money, but she refuses it, deciding to go to London to make her living as a poet. =Third Book= This book opens in Aurora's London apartment. She has been writing small popular poems for magazines, which have earned her an enthusiastic following among romantic young men and women, but she is dissatisfied. The great works of art of which she felt she was capable have arrived stillborn ‚Äì she has the inspiration, but somehow cannot get it onto the page. While she works, frustrated, a visitor arrives for her, a Lady Waldemar. She is beautiful but sharp and sarcastic, and Aurora does not like her. Lady Waldemar explains to Aurora that she is in love with Romney, so much so that she lowers herself to do charity work with him, but Romney has decided to marry instead one of his lower-class ‚Äòprojects,' Marian Erle (whose name is a pun). She wants Aurora to speak to Marian and then to Romney and convince them of their foolishness. Aurora, partly out of curiosity and partly concern for Romney, goes to visit Marian and hears her life story: Marian's drunken mother tried to sell her into prostitution, and to escape it she ran away and became ill, eventually being taken into a poor hospital. There Romney found her and assisted her in getting work as a seamstress. =Fourth Book= Marian continues her story, relating how Romney continued to aid her and ultimately proposed marriage to her. Aurora asks her if she is sure he truly loves her, to which Marian replies that Romney loves everything. She assures Aurora that despite her lower-class status, she will be a loving and devoted wife to him. Before Aurora can answer, Romney enters Marian's room. He and Aurora awkwardly trade words, and she tells him she approves of Marian. He walks her home, and during their conversation she becomes confused about her own feelings for him. A month passes, and it is time for Romney and Marian's wedding ‚Äì but Marian sends a letter in her place to the ceremony, telling Romney that she is not good enough for him. The crowd at the wedding assume that Romney has seduced and abandoned her, and attack him. Romney is devastated, and searches for Marian for days, but cannot find her. He and Aurora have a conversation about their respective disappointments with their missions; Romney can neither make a dent in the poverty he sees all around him nor gain the respect of the people he tries to help, while Aurora still has not succeeded in writing a real work of Art. =Fifth Book= Aurora discusses her further attempts to write. She tells how she is determined not to be constricted by her woman's role but is doubtful that the modern age presents opportunities for epic poetry. As the book continues, she grows more and more desperate, crying out to her muses and gods for inspiration. She confides that she has not seen Romney Leigh for almost two years, but she has heard that he has turned Leigh Hall into a refuge for the poor. At a stifling, insipid evening party at one of her well-born friend's houses, she learns that Romney is engaged to marry Lady Waldemar, and bitterly reflects that \\"He loved not Marian, more than once he loved/Aurora.\\" She decides that to find inspiration, she must travel to Italy, her mother's land, and in order to get the money sells some of her father's old books, as well as her own unfinished manuscript. =Sixth Book= This book begins with Aurora in France, presumably on a stop-over on the way to Italy. She wanders Paris with her head in the clouds, enjoying the atmosphere of history and the beauty that surrounds her. Suddenly, she catches a glimpse of a familiar face ‚Äì it is Marian Erle. Frantically, Aurora follows her, losing her in the crowd eventually, but not before seeing that Marian is carrying a child. She is shocked, but resolves not to judge her harshly and tries for a week to find her, finally running into her by chance at a flower market. Marian takes her to her poor room, where she shows Aurora her baby boy. Aurora reproaches Marian for being promiscuous, but Marian angrily replies that far from it, she was attacked and raped and left pregnant. She explains to Aurora that Lady Waldemar convinced her that Romney did not truly love her, and sent her to France with her lady's maid. The lady's maid left her in a brothel, where she was raped and almost driven insane, but she managed to escape. =Seventh Book= Marian continues to tell Aurora her story: she was taken in by a kind lady as a maid, but was summarily fired when her pregnancy became apparent. Despite this, she could not bring herself to be unhappy: she was overjoyed that out of her dreadful experience, she could have the wonderful experience of motherhood. Aurora, after hearing Marian's story, apologizes profusely to her for misjudging her and offers her a ‚Äòmarriage' of sorts ‚Äì she will protect Marian and her son and take them to Italy with her. Marian gratefully accepts. Aurora decides not to inform Romney that she has found Marian, but writes an angry letter to Lady Waldemar, telling her she knows of her disgraceful conduct towards Marian. Marian's presence, however, constantly brings Romney to Aurora's thoughts. She is surprised when a friend writes to her to congratulate her on her book ‚Äì the manuscript she sold to get to Italy. She decides that perhaps it was better than she thought. She finds no particular inspiration in Italy, however, finding instead constant bittersweet memories of her childhood. =Eighth Book= Several years have passed. Aurora, Marian, and the boy are living in a villa in Florence. Suddenly, Romney Leigh arrives, having discovered their whereabouts through a friend of Aurora's. Aurora, believing him to be married to Lady Waldemar, is cold with him. He tells her that he has read her book and believes it to be good and true Art, and tells her that he has reconsidered the judgmental strictures he passed on her previously. He relates to her the sorry failure of his attempts at social reform: after he converted Leigh Hall into a refuge, stories went around the village that it was a prison and a mob burned the whole thing to the ground. Aurora expresses her sympathy, but tells him she still cannot think well of his wife. Romney is surprised, and tells her that he is not married to Lady Waldemar, although he has a message from her to Aurora. Aurora tears it open, and reads it. =Ninth Book= Aurora reads Lady Waldemar's letter, which claims that she did not intend to hurt Marian, only to remove her. Her scheme did not work; even after Marian was gone, Romney did not love her. She tells Aurora, in a vitriolic tone, that she, by her letter forcing Lady Waldemar to tell Romney that Marian lived, has doomed him to a loveless life with her, when he is truly in love with Aurora. Aurora, somewhat shocked both by the letter's contents and the angry rhetoric, dazedly asks Romney what he will do now, and he answers that he will marry Marian and raise her child as his own. Marian refuses him, however, stating that she prefers to remain as her child's only guardian and devote her life to him, rather than a husband, and that she has realized that what she thought was love for Romney was rather hero-worship. She leaves, urging Romney to talk to Aurora. They converse, and forgive each other for any wrongs they have done to each other over the years. Romney admits to Aurora that he is blind. Aurora, in tears, confesses to Romney that she loves him, and has finally realized it; and also realizes that, in loving him, she will be able to complete herself and find her poetic muse once more. The poem ends with Aurora and Romney in a loving embrace, as she describes the landscape for his unseeing eyes in Biblical metaphors.

The expression it girl originated in British upper-class society around the turn of the 20th century.Etherington-Smith, Meredith & Pilcher, Jeremy. (1986). The 'It' Girls, 241. It gained further attention in 1927 with the popularity of the Paramount Studios film \\"It\\", starring Clara Bow. In the earlier usage, a woman was especially perceived as an it girl if she had achieved a high level of popularity without flaunting her sexuality. Today the term is used more to apply simply to fame and beauty.  Early use  An early literary usage of it in this sense may be traced to a 1904 short story by Rudyard Kipling, which contained the line \\"It isn't beauty, so to speak, nor good talk necessarily. It's just 'It'.\\" Elinor Glyn, the notorious British novelist who wrote the book titled It and its subsequent screenplay, lectured: Glyn first rose to fame as the author of the scandalous 1907 bestseller Three Weeks. She is widely credited with the invention of the \\"It Girl\\" concept: although the slang predates her book and film, she was responsible for the term's impact on the culture of the 1920s. Clara Bow later said she wasn't sure what \\"It\\" meant,Waterloo Daily Courier, 21 September 1950 although she identified Lana Turner and later Marilyn Monroe as \\"It Girls\\", and Robert Mitchum as an \\"It Man\\". The fashion component of the It Girl originated with the celebrated couturier Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, known professionally as \\"Lucile\\", the name under which she managed exclusive salons in London, Paris and New York; she was Elinor Glyn's elder sister. As Lucile, Lucy Duff-Gordon was the first designer to present her collections on a stage complete with the theatrical accoutrements of lights and music, inspiring the modern runway or catwalk show, and she was famous for making sexuality an aspect of fashion through her provocative lingerie and lingerie-inspired clothes.Evans, Caroline. (2013). The Mechanical Smile, pp 34‚Äì36, 39‚Äì41Bigham, Randy Bryan. (2012). Lucile: Her Life by Design pp 23‚Äì31. Lucile also specialised in dressing trendsetting stage and film performers, ranging from the stars of the Ziegfeld Follies on Broadway to silent screen icons such as Mary Pickford and Irene Castle. As early as 1917, Lucile herself used the term It in relation to style in her fashion column for Harper's Bazaar: \\"... I saw a very ladylike and well-bred friend of mine in her newest Parisian frock ... she felt she was 'it' and perfectly happy.\\"Duff-Gordon, Lady (Lucile). (1917). \\"The Last Word in Fashions\\". Harper's Bazaar, 63, October 1917Bigham, Randy Bryan. (2012). Lucile - Her Life by Design, 31, 275.  \\"It\\" (1927 film)  The Paramount Studios film was planned as a special showcase for its popular star Clara Bow, and her spectacular performanceprivate showing. (1927-01-01) Variety introduced the term \\"It\\" to the cultural lexicon. The film plays with the notion that \\"It\\" is a quality which eschews definitions and categories; consequently, the girl portrayed by Bow is an amalgam of an ingenue and a femme fatale, with a touch of Madonna's latter day \\"Material Girl\\" incarnation. By contrast, Bow's rival in the script is equally young and comely (and rich and well-bred to boot), yet she doesn't have \\"It\\".  Modern \\"It Girls\\"  Since the 1980s, It Girl or It-Girl has been used slightly differently, referring to a wealthy, normally unemployed, young woman who is pictured in tabloids going to many parties often in the company of other celebrities, receiving media coverage in spite of no real personal achievements or TV hosting / presenting. The writer William Donaldson observed that, having initially been coined in the 1920s, the term was applied in the 1990s to describe \\"a young woman of noticeable 'sex appeal' who occupied herself by shoe shopping and party-going\\".Donaldson, W. (2002) Brewer's Rogues, Villains and Eccentrics. The prominence of an \\"It Girl\\" is often temporary; some of the rising It Girls will either become fully-fledged celebrities, commonly initially via engineering appearances on reality TV shows or series; lacking such an accelerant, their popularity will normally fade. = Film and theater = * Glyn's 1927 film script was adapted into a musical called The It Girl, which opened off-Broadway in 2001 at the York Theatre Company, starring Jean Louisa Kelly.

Chepstow Railway Bridge was built to the instructions of Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1852. The \\"Great Tubular Bridge\\" over the River Wye at Chepstow, which at that point forms the boundary between Wales and England, is considered one of Brunel's major achievements, despite its appearance. It was economical in its use of materials, and would prove to be the design prototype for Brunel's Royal Albert Bridge at Saltash. Although the superstructure has since been replaced, Brunel's tubular iron supports are still in place. It is a Grade II listed structure.  Background  Mabey Bridge works. Brunel had to take the two tracks of the South Wales Railway across the River Wye. The Admiralty had insisted on a clear span over the river, with the bridge a minimum of above high tide. The span would have to be self-supporting, since although the Gloucestershire side of the river consists of a limestone cliff, the Monmouthshire side is low-lying sedimentary deposit subject to regular flooding. Thus on that side, there was nowhere for an abutment capable of either resisting the outward push of an arch bridge, or the inward pull of a conventional suspension bridge. In any case, neither could be used: an arch bridge would not have met the height and width restrictions imposed by the Admiralty, and suspension bridges were notoriously unfit for carrying railway trains. The concentrated weight caused the chains to deflect, allowing the bridge-deck to ride dangerously up and down. A self-supporting truss bridge was the only option. Robert Stephenson had bridged the River Conwy (1848) and the Menai Straits (1850) with spans of 400 and respectively, using large box- girder sections of riveted wrought iron. Conwy-like box-girders would have been very expensive to use at Chepstow as well as being heavy (problematic, since the spans had to be lifted much higher than at Conwy). Brunel, characteristically, sought a radical solution. He had already built a bowstring or tied arch bridge at Windsor (1849) consisting of three triangular cross-section cellular arch ribs \\"strung\\" by wrought iron deck girders supported by vertical hangers from the arches. This was the same year as Stephenson's tied arch High Level Bridge at Newcastle upon Tyne, which was supposed to have influenced Brunel at Chepstow. However, Brunel's solution for the latter was to make a leap forward, based, nevertheless, on sound engineering principles and a variation of the tied-arch theme. The experiments of William Fairbairn, and the mathematical analysis of Eaton Hodgkinson had shown by a series of experiments that an enclosed box girder, made of riveted wrought iron, combined relative lightness with great strength. The tubular wrought-iron girder ‚Äì be the cross-section rectangular, triangular or circular ‚Äì formed a most efficient truss component. If the cross-section was large enough it could be self-supporting. It was Fairbairn's experiments that led to the design of the Menai and Conwy bridges. Stephenson had originally proposed using a box-girder section suspended from chains. The box section would, he argued, be stiff enough to overcome the conventional problems of the bridge- decks of suspension bridges. In the event, Fairbairn showed that a properly constructed box girder would be strong enough so that the chains could be dispensed with. Nevertheless, the decision (not to use chains) was taken late in the project, so the Britannia bridge support towers were still built with holes for the chains. Stephenson's box-girders were a great innovation, and using steel or pre-stressed concrete instead of wrought iron, box-girder construction is the standard today for large bridges. But as Berridge has observed, \\"Brunel was never one to follow fashion for fashion's sake... (at Chepstow)... Here was the real engineer at work, designing the bridge to suit the site and the best way of getting it into position\\". The bridge filled a gap in the main rail line between Gloucester and Swansea. The line between Chepstow railway station and Swansea was opened on 18 June 1850, and on 19 September 1851 the line was completed between Gloucester and a station east of the river, known as Chepstow East. Until the bridge was completed and opened, through passengers were carried from one station to the other by coach, using the 1816 road bridge across the River Wye. The railway bridge was opened to public use for the first time on 19 July 1852; Chepstow East station closed at the same time as redundant. Originally there was only one line of railway over the bridge; a second was brought into use on 18 April 1853. The new railway line, and bridge, had the effect of reducing the journey time between London and Swansea from 15 hours, by rail, road and ferry, to 5 hours by rail.Chepstow Society, Brunel's Tubular Suspension Bridge over the River Wye, 1970, SBN 900278 04 8  The Chepstow Bridge design  Brunel's cast iron pillars for the original bridge, still supporting the modern railway bridge and its underhung truss. Brunel recognised that a circular cross-section tubular girder ‚Äì a shallow \\"bow\\", excellent in compression and tension ‚Äì could be strung by suspension chains to form a stiff, self-supporting structure very much lighter (thus less expensive) than a Stephenson-type box girder. Instead of hanging the chains from towers and suspending the bridge deck from them, Brunel used the chains to stress and slightly bow the tubes, which were braced against the chains using struts. The bridge deck was rigid, because it was effectively clamped against the tubes by the chains. Brunel solved the problem in his own way, and for more than 100 years, the Chepstow and subsequently the Royal Albert Bridge were the only suspension bridges on the British railway system. In spite of their apparent rivalry, Brunel and Stephenson were great personal friends, to the extent that they supported each other professionally. When Stephenson was under pressure during the enquiry following the collapse of his cast-iron girder bridge over the River Dee killing several people, Brunel did not desert him. In spite of his extreme distrust of the use of cast-iron girders for such purposes, Brunel refused to condemn them when cross-examined as an expert witness. He was also present to provide Stephenson moral support, when the great Britannia box-girders were floated across the river prior to being jacked up to their final positions. So when it came to the revolutionary design at Chepstow, The Times of 24 February 1852, reported that ‚ÄúMr Stephenson, the eminent engineer, has examined the (great railway) bridge (at Chepstow) and concurred in the plan adopted by Mr Brunel...‚Äù. The bridge was a triumph of the application of a radical design to a specific problem using available materials. The total cost (¬£77,000) was half what the Conwy bridge cost (¬£145,190 18s 0d) ‚Äî admittedly with a main span of only compared with Conwy's , but there were no deep-water foundations needed at Conwy, and at Chepstow, the cost included a further of land spans. With regard to the appearance of the bridge, the Illustrated London News stated that \\"the peculiarity of the site did not permit any display of 'Art' ‚Äì that is, of architectural embellishment; indeed, a pure taste rejects any attempt to decorate a large mechanical work with sham columns, pilasters, and small ornamental details.\\" The bridge was constructed on site for Brunel by Edward Finch of Liverpool as partner in the firm Finch & Willey. After it was completed, Finch remained in Chepstow, and developed a major engineering and, later, shipbuilding business on the site, beside the river. The adjoining site, later occupied by the engineering firm Mabey Bridge (formerly Fairfield Mabey), was engaged in prefabricated bridge construction, and in 1987 was responsible for building the A48 road bridge which now runs alongside the railway bridge.Ivor Waters, The Town of Chepstow, 1972Alan Crow, Bridges on the River Wye, 1995, Mabey left the site in 2015, and as at 2020 it is being redeveloped for housing. Saul Cooke-Black, \\"Major housing scheme for 345 homes at the former Fairfield-Mabey Bridge site in Chepstow is approved by councillors\\", South Wales Argus, 7 May 2019. Retrieved 6 July 2020  Legacy  Present day Chepstow Railway Bridge However, even Brunel was not infallible, and his foresight in allowing for slight movement of the suspension chains against supports on the bridge-deck to relieve stress, led to a weakening of the structure. In the 1950s, the speed of trains using the bridge was restricted to , because some of the girders had become distorted. In 1962, a new structure to support the bridge beneath the main span was put in place. Of the bridges mentioned here, the Windsor and Conwy bridges are still standing and in use, although the Conwy spans have been shortened using intermediate supports; the Britannia bridge had to be replaced in 1970 after a fire. Nevertheless, Brunel's Chepstow bridge was a watershed, leading to a final refinement of the design in his great masterpiece, the Royal Albert Bridge over the River Tamar at Saltash, which continues to carry the former Cornwall Railway main line into Cornwall.

She probably was the first wife of Vytautas the Great, Grand Duke of Lithuania. Anna was mother of Sophia of Lithuania, the only child of Vytautas and wife of Vasily I of Moscow. She is best remembered for helping Vytautas to escape from a prison in Kreva in 1382 and thus probably saving his life. Little is known about Anna's life and even her origins remain disputed by historians. Life =During the civil wars= Likely Anna and Vytautas were married between 1368 and 1377 or around 1370. Anna first comes to light in 1382 when her husband was imprisoned in the Kreva Castle by his cousin Jogaila during the Lithuanian Civil War (1381‚Äì1384). While all accounts agree that she freed her husband, details vary from source to source. It is unclear how much freedom Anna had in Kreva and if she was guarded. It is written in the Lithuanian Chronicles that she had two maids with her. She convinced one of them to exchange clothes with Vytautas who then escaped undetected. Chronicler Wigand of Marburg claimed that Vytautas dressed in Anna's clothes rather than in one of Anna's maids. It is believed that Anna remained in Kreva and no information is available on how she escaped or was released. Historian Teodor Narbutt (1784‚Äì1864) later added many colorful details to the story, including Vytautas illness and maid Alena, who sacrificed herself to save her master. In 1389, when her husband's coup to capture Vilnius failed, she was in Hrodna. After the failed coup Anna followed her husband to the Teutonic Knights, where Vytautas asked for an alliance against his cousins Jogaila and Skirgaila in the Lithuanian Civil War (1389‚Äì1392). For a while she was held hostage to guarantee that Vytautas would not break the alliance. After the disagreements were settled in 1392, Anna confirmed the Ostr√≥w Agreement, the peace treaty which made Vytautas the Grand Duke of Lithuania. She signed two letters, one given to Jogaila and another to his wife Jadwiga of Poland. Anna continued to be active in political life and attended negotiations for the Treaty of Salynas (1398). =Later life= Kƒôstutis and his son Vytautas imprisoned in Kreva by Jogaila in 1382. Kƒôstutis died within a week. Vytautas remained locked up for a couple of months before being saved by his wife Anna. Before 1396, she and her husband traveled to K√©sm√°rk to meet King Sigismund of Hungary to establish a friendly relationship. While they spoke for a long time, a fire broke out burning half of the city, leading the Hungarian nobles to suspect Vytautas's people. Sigismund intervened and cleared up the situation, resuming the negotiations. After the visit was finished, Vytautas and his wife Anna gave many presents to Sigismund including a coat, a hat and gloves made of sable fur and embroidered in gold. Details of all these presents \\"given by Vytautas's wife\\" were recorded in a 15th-century chronicle by , a close associate of Sigismund of Hungary. In 1400, Anna visited the tomb of Dorothy of Montau in Marienwerder (modern Kwidzyn), and prayed in the churches of Saint Anne in Brandenburg and of Saint Barbara in Oldenburg. She was accompanied by her brother-in-law Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis and an escort of 400 men. Anna was greeted with expensive gifts and lavish receptions. Anna continued to maintain good relationship with the Teutonic Knights, who sent her expensive gifts, including a clavichord and portative organ in 1408 and rare wine in 1416. After her death, all churches in Prussia were ordered to hold requiem masses. Various chronicles and documents recorded much less positive interaction between Anna and Poland. It is believed that St. Anne's Church, built in Vilnius Lower Castle before 1390, was so named in Anna's honor. It was later known as St. Barbara's Church but did not survive to the present. Flemish traveler Guillebert de Lannoy wrote favorably about the Grand Duchess. After her death in 1418, Vytautas wanted to marry her niece Uliana Olshanska, daughter of Ivan Olshanski. Polish historian Jan D≈Çugosz asserts that Ivan of Karachev, first husband of Uliana, was murdered by Vytautas in order to marry her. The Bishop of Vilnius refused the ceremony due to their close relationship (Vytautas was Uliana's uncle-in-law) and demanded they seek approval from the pope. Eventually the Bishop of W≈Çoc≈Çawek performed the ceremony. Family =Origin= There is considerable debate about who the parents of Anna were. According to the Bychowiec Chronicle, a late and unreliable source, Anna was a sister of Yuri Svyatoslavich, the last sovereign ruler of the Principality of Smolensk. For a long time this was the only theory about her origins. In 1933, Lithuanian historian Ignas Jonynas published a study in which he attempted to debunk the Bychowiec Chronicle and demonstrate that Anna was not an Orthodox duchess from Slavic lands, but a daughter of a local Lithuanian noble. Jonynas pointed out that no other contemporary source mentions the relationship between Vytautas and Yuri even though Lithuania and Smolensk were at war several times. The First Lithuanian Chronicle, the basis for which was written while Vytautas was still alive, describes how wars against Smolensk were waged in 1386, 1395, 1401, and 1404, but mentions nothing about Vytautas and Yuri being in-laws. Jonynas argued that Anna was a sister of Sudimantas, a nobleman from Ei≈°i≈°kƒós and commander of Vytautas' army. Teutonic Chronicle mentions Sudimantas as swoger of Vytautas. At the time swoger meant brother-in-law. Another document from 1416 refers to Sudimantas as magen, which denoted a relative, usually related by blood. Since Jonynas' study, Sudimantas has been variously presented as Anna's brother, father, or sister's husband. In his 1995 article, Polish historian Jan Tƒôgowski disagreed with Jonynas and argued that the Bychowiec Chronicle was correct. He argued that Sudimantas was married to a sister of Anna. Tƒôgowski's main argument that Anna was from Smolensk rested on two documents from 1413 that mention a \\"Russian duke Basil\\" as Vytautas's brother-in-law. Tƒôgowski identified this Basil as a son of . Lithuanian historian Inga Baranauskienƒó refuted this identification since the only known Basil from Smolensk was a son of Ivan, Sviatoslav's brother. She also analyzed the overall relationship between Smolensk and Lithuania noting it was mostly adversary. Further, she noted that Anna had two sisters who were married to local Lithuanian nobles which would be virtually impossible if they were daughters of the Prince of Smolensk. =Sisters= Flemish traveler Guillebert de Lannoy mentioned that he was received by two sisters of Anna when he visited Vilnius in 1413. A 1390 complaint written by Vytautas against cousins Jogaila and Skirgaila mentioned that his wife's sister was married to his close associate Ivan Olshanski. A memorial book from a monastery in Liubech recorded her name as Agrippina (these books recorded names of the deceased so that they could be remembered in prayers). Ivan and Agrippina had at least four sons and a daughter (Uliana Olshanska who married Vytautas after Anna's death). Another sister of Anna was mentioned by historian Jan D≈Çugosz (1415‚Äì1480). He recorded that Julijona, sister of Anna, was married to Narimantas who was murdered by Vytautas during an attack on Vilnius in 1390; Julijona later married Albertas Manvydas, the first Voivode of Vilnius. The Latin version of the 1390 complaint by Vytautas recorded a different version ‚Äì before her marriage to Albertas Manvydas, she was married to Butrimas, a cousin of Vytautas, who was murdered in retribution for the hanging of Vaidila.

It is one of the 65 ELCA synods. The synod covers Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery counties as well as the City of Philadelphia. The synod includes more than 70,000 baptized members, 154 congregations and missions, and more than 340 rostered ministers (pastors, deacons, and members of the ELCA Deaconess Community). The synodical organization, the office of the bishop, and related staff provide support, resources and programs for the congregations and rostered and lay leaders of the synod. On May 5, 2018, the synod elected the Rev. Patricia Ann Curtis Davenport as its fifth bishop. She assumed office on August 1, 2018. Bishop Davenport is the first woman of African-American descent to be elected a bishop in the ELCA. The following day, the South Central Synod of Wisconsin elected another African-American pastor, the Rev. Viviane Thomas-Breitfeld, as its bishop. They were among six women elected bishops in the ELCA in 2018, bringing the total number of women in the Conference of Bishops to 16. Bishop Davenport will be installed on September 22, 2018, by ELCA Presiding Bishop Elizabeth A. Eaton. Prior to her election, Bishop Davenport served as the Synod‚Äôs Director for Evangelical Mission and Assistant to the Bishop. She previously served as founding Pastor/Developer for Spirit and Truth Worship Center, a new church start in Yeadon, Pa. She received the Master of Divinity degree from the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia, now United Lutheran Seminary. The highest legislative authority of the synod is the Synod Assembly, which meets annually in May. The Synod Council is the board of directors of the synod and is its interim legislative authority between meetings of the Synod Assembly. The Synod Council normally meets five times every year. The Bishop is elected by the Synod Assembly and may serve an unlimited number of six-year terms. The other synod officers are the Vice President (who must be a layperson), Secretary, and Treasurer (either a layperson or a rostered pastor), all of whom may serve an unlimited number of four-year terms. The synod's current office is located on the grounds of United Lutheran Seminary, having been moved from its previous office in Norristown, Pennsylvania in 2008. The synod's territory is located in an area rich in German and Swedish history, with the latter bringing Lutheranism (as missions of the Church of Sweden) in the 1640s before the subsequent takeover of Tinicum (present-day Chester) by the British and the formation of the Province of Pennsylvania under the Quaker William Penn, who invited scores of people, mostly British Quakers and German Lutherans and Anabaptists (Amish and Mennonite), to settle the land. Its predecessor body, the Ministerium of Pennsylvania and Adjacent States, the oldest Lutheran synod in America, was organized in 1748 at Philadelphia by the Lutheran patriarch, Pastor Henry Melchior Muhlenberg of Trappe, Pennsylvania. The synod is also the home of United Lutheran Seminary (ULS) formerly Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia (LTSP). Since the Called to Common Mission with the Episcopal Church, it has been in ecumenical partnership with the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania, allowing the synod and the diocese to share both pastors and staff. Symbolically, the synod gave the diocese a baptismal font with the consecration of the new Philadelphia Episcopal Cathedral located in Philadelphia's \\"University City\\" section (near the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University). Geographically, the synod shares the same five-county area as the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia and the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania. The Eastern Pennsylvania Conference of the United Methodist Church, part of the larger Philadelphia Episcopal Area (which includes the Peninsula Delaware Conference), is also located within the geographic boundaries of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Synod, but also includes territory located within the ELCA's Northeastern Pennsylvania Synod, mostly the Lehigh Valley and Pocono Mountains regions.

After his death in 1341, Kreva became the patrimony of his son and successor, Algirdas. In 1382, the Grand Duke Kƒôstutis was imprisoned in Kreva during the Lithuanian Civil War (1381‚Äì84) and subsequently murdered on the order by his nephew Jogaila. The ruins of the castle were severely damaged during World War I, as they were near the front lines. They remain extant to the present day. In 1385, the Union of Krewo (Act of Kreva) was signed in Kreva. In 1387, following the Christianization of Lithuania, the Grand Duke Jogaila established the first Catholic parish in the Lithuanian pagan lands and built a church which is now known as the Church of St. Mary. Before World War II, 500 Jews lived in the village. After the German occupation of the town they are kept imprisoned in a ghetto and used as used as slave labourers in harsh conditions.

Italy had emerged from World War I in a poor and weakened condition and, after the war, suffered inflation, massive debts and an extended depression. By 1920, the economy was in a massive convulsion, with mass unemployment, food shortages, strikes and so on. That conflagration of viewpoints can be exemplified by the so-called Biennio Rosso (Two Red Years).  Background  There were some economic problems in Europe like inflation in the aftermath of the war. The consumer price index in Italy continued to increase after 1920 but Italy did not experience hyperinflation on the level of Austria, Poland, Hungary, Russia and Germany. The costs of the war and postwar reconstruction contributed to inflationary pressure. The changing political attitudes of the post-war period and rise of a working class was also a factor and Italy was one of several countries where there was a disagreement about the tax burden.  Fascist economic policy  Benito Mussolini came to power in 1922 under a parliamentary coalition until the National Fascist Party seized control and ushered in a one-party dictatorship by early 1925. The growth in Mussolini‚Äôs popularity to the extent of becoming a national leader was gradual as would be expected for a leader of any fascist movement. The doctrine only succeeded in Italy because the public was just as enthusiastic for change as much as Mussolini was committed to doing away with the liberal doctrines and Marxism in the country. Therefore, he would later write and distribute The Doctrine of Fascism to the Italian society, which ended up being the basis of the Fascist agenda throughout Mussolini‚Äôs dictatorship. Mussolini did not simply thrust himself into the dictatorship position, but rather rose gradually based on his understanding of the existing support for his ideas in the country. Before the dictatorship era, Mussolini tried to transform the country's economy along fascist ideology, at least on paper. In fact, he was not an economic radical, nor did he seek a free-hand in the economy. The Fascist Party held a minority faction of only three positions in the cabinet, excluding Mussolini;Howard M. Sachar, The Assassination of Europe 1918-1942: A Political History, University Press of Toronto Press, 2015, p. 48 and providing other political parties more independence. During the coalition period, Mussolini appointed a classical liberal economist, Alberto De Stefani, originally a stalwart leader in the Center Party as Italy‚Äôs Minister of Finance,Howard M. Sachar,The Assassination of Europe, 1918-1942: A Political History, Toronto: Canada, University of Toronto Press, 2015, p. 48 who advanced economic liberalism, along with minor privatization. Before his dismissal in 1925, Stefani \\"simplified the tax code, cut taxes, curbed spending, liberalized trade restrictions and abolished rent controls\\", where the Italian economy grew more than 20 percent, and unemployment fell 77 percent, under his influence.Jim Powell, ‚ÄúThe Economic Leadership Secrets of Benito Mussolini,‚Äù Forbes, Feb. 22, 2012. Source: To proponents of the first view, Mussolini did have a clear economic agenda, both long and short-term, from the beginning of his rule. The government had two main objectives‚Äîto modernize the economy and to remedy the country's lack of strategic resources. Before the removal of Stefani, Mussolini's administration pushed the modern capitalistic sector in the service of the state, intervening directly as needed to create a collaboration between the industrialists, the workers and the state. The government moved toward resolving class conflicts in favour of corporatism. In the short term, the government worked to reform the widely abused tax system, dispose of inefficient state-owned industry, cut government costs and introduce tariffs to protect the new industries. However, these policies ended after Mussolini took dictatorial controls and terminated the coalition. The lack of industrial resources, especially the key ingredients of the Industrial Revolution, was countered by the intensive development of the available domestic sources and by aggressive commercial policies‚Äîsearching for particular raw material trade deals, or attempting strategic colonization. In order to promote trade, Mussolini pushed the Italian parliament to ratify an \\"Italo-Soviet political and economic agreement\\" by early 1923.Xenia Joukoff Eudin and Harold Henry Fisher, Soviet Russia and the West, 1920-1927: A Documentary Survey, Stanford University Press, 1957, p. 190 This agreement assisted Mussolini‚Äôs effort to have the Soviet Union officially recognized by Italy in 1924, the first Western nation to do so.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism 1914‚Äî1945, University of Wisconsin Press, 1995 p. 223 With the signing of the 1933 Treaty of Friendship, Nonaggression, and Neutrality with the Soviet Union, Fascist Italy became a major trading partner with Joseph Stalin's Russia, exchanging natural resources from Soviet Russia for technical assistance from Italy, which included the fields of aviation, automobile and naval technology.Donald J. Stoker Jr. and Jonathan A. Grant, editors, Girding for Battle: The Arms Trade in a Global Perspective 1815-1940, Westport: CT, Praeger Publishers, 2003, page 180 Although a disciple of the French Marxist Georges Sorel and the main leader of the Italian Socialist Party in his early years, Mussolini abandoned the theory of class struggle for class collaboration. Some fascist syndicalists turned to economic collaboration of the classes to create a \\"productivist\\" posture where \\"a proletariat of producers\\" would be critical to the \\"conception of revolutionary politics\\" and social revolution.A. James Gregor, Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship, Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, pp. 59-60 However, most fascist syndicalists instead followed the lead of Edmondo Rossoni, who favored combining nationalism with class struggle,Franklin Hugh Adler, Italian Industrialists from Liberalism to Fascism: The Political Development of the Industrial Bourgeoisie, 1906-1934, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 311 often displaying a hostile attitude towards capitalists. This anti-capitalist hostility was so contentious that in 1926 Rossoni denounced industrialists as \\"vampires\\" and \\"profiteers\\".Lavoro d'Italia, January 6, 1926 Since Italy‚Äôs economy was generally undeveloped with little industrialization, fascists and revolutionary syndicalists, such as Angelo Oliviero Olivetti, argued that the Italian working class could not have the requisite numbers or consciousness \\"to make revolution\\".A. James Gregor, Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship, Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 55 They instead followed Karl Marx's admonition that a nation required \\"full maturation of capitalism as the precondition for socialist realization\\".A. James Gregor, Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship, Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 59 Under this interpretation, especially as expounded by Sergio Panunzio, a major theoretician of Italian fascism, \\"[s]yndicalists were productivists, rather than distributionists\\".A. James Gregor, Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship, Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 60 Fascist intellectuals were determined to foster economic development to enable a syndicalist economy to \\"attain its productive maximum\\", which they identified as crucial to \\"socialist revolution\\".A. James Gregor, Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship, Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, pp. 60-61  Structural deficit, public works and social welfare  Referring to the economics of John Maynard Keynes as \\"useful introduction to fascist economics\\", Mussolini spent Italy into a structural deficit that grew exponentially.James Strachey Barnes, Universal Aspects of Fascism, Williams and Norgate, London: UK, (1928) pp. 113-114 In Mussolini‚Äôs first year as Prime Minister in 1922, Italy's national debt stood at 93 billion lire. By 1934, Italian historian Gaetano Salvemini, estimated Italy's national debt had risen to 149 billion lire.John T. Flynn, As We Go Marching, New York: NY, Doubleday and Company, Inc., 1944, p. 51. Also see ‚ÄúTwelve Years of Fascist Finance,‚Äù by Dr. Gaetano Salvemini Foreign Affairs, April 1935, Vol. 13, No. 3, p. 463 In 1943, The New York Times put Italy‚Äôs national debt as 406 billion lire.John T. Flynn, As We Go Marching, New York: NY, Doubleday and Company, Inc., 1944, p. 50. See New York Times, Aug. 8, 1943 A former school teacher, Mussolini‚Äôs spending on the public sector, schools and infrastructure was considered extravagant. Mussolini \\"instituted a programme of public works hitherto unrivaled in modern Europe. Bridges, canals and roads were built, hospitals and schools, railway stations and orphanages; swamps were drained and land reclaimed, forests were planted and universities were endowed\\".Christopher Hibbert, Benito Mussolini: A Biography, Geneva: Switzerland, Heron Books, 1962, p. 56 As for the scope and spending on social welfare programs, Italian fascism \\"compared favorably with the more advanced European nations and in some respect was more progressive\\".A. James Gregor, Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship, Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 263 When New York city politician Grover Aloysius Whalen asked Mussolini about the meaning behind Italian fascism in 1939, the reply was: \\"It is like your New Deal!\\".Grover Aloysius Whalen, Mr. New York: The Autobiography of Grover A. Whalen, G.P. Putnam‚Äôs Sons, 1955, p. 188 By 1925, the Fascist government had \\"embarked upon an elaborate program\\" that included food supplementary assistance, infant care, maternity assistance, general healthcare, wage supplements, paid vacations, unemployment benefits, illness insurance, occupational disease insurance, general family assistance, public housing and old age and disability insurance.A. James Gregor, Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship, Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, pp. 258-264 As for public works, the Mussolini's administration \\"devoted 400 million lire of public monies\\" for school construction between 1922 and 1942, compared to only 60 million lire between 1862 and 1922.A. James Gregor, Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship, Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 260  First steps  The Fascist government began its reign in an insecure position. Coming to power in 1922 after the March on Rome, it was a minority government until the 1923 Acerbo Law and the 1924 elections and it took until 1925, after the assassination of Giacomo Matteotti, to establish itself securely as a dictatorship. Economic policy in the first few years was largely classical liberal, with the Ministry of Finance controlled by the old liberal Alberto De Stefani. The multiparty coalition government undertook a low-key laissez-faire program‚Äîthe tax system was restructured (February 1925 law, 23 June 1927 decree-law and so on), there were attempts to attract foreign investment and establish trade agreements and efforts were made to balance the budget and cut subsidies. The 10% tax on capital invested in banking and industrial sectors was repealed while the tax on directors and administrators of anonymous companies (SA) was cut down by half. All foreign capital was exonerated of taxes while the luxury tax was also repealed. Mussolini also opposed municipalization of enterprises. The 19 April 1923 law transferred life insurance to private enterprise, repealing a 1912 law that created a State Institute for insurances, which had envisioned construction of state monopoly ten years later.Daniel Gu√©rin, Fascism and Big Business, Chapter IX, First section, p.191 in the 1999 Syllepse Editions Furthermore, a 19 November 1922 decree suppressed the Commission on war profits while the 20 August 1923 law suppressed the inheritance tax inside the family circle.Daniel Gu√©rin, Fascism and Big Business, Chapter IX, Second section, p.193 in the 1999 Syllepse Editions There was a general emphasis on what has been called productivism‚Äînational economic growth as a means of social regeneration and wider assertion of national importance. Up until 1925, the country enjoyed modest growth, but structural weaknesses increased inflation and the currency slowly fell (1922 L90 to ¬£1, 1925 G135 to ¬£1). In 1925, there was a great increase in speculation and short runs against the lira. The levels of capital movement became so great the government attempted to intervene. De Stefani was sacked, his program side-tracked and the Fascist government became more involved in the economy in step with the increased security of their power. In 1925, the Italian state abandoned its monopoly on telephone infrastructure while the state production of matches was handed over to a private \\"Consortium of matches' productors\\". Furthermore, various banking and industrial companies were financially supported by the state. One of Mussolini's first acts was to fund the metallurgical trust Ansaldo to the height of 400 million lire. Following a deflation crisis that started in 1926, banks such as the Banco di Roma, the Banco di Napoli and Banco di Sicilia were also assisted by the state.Daniel Gu√©rin, Fascism and Big Business, Chapter IX, Fifth section, p.197 in the 1999 Syllepse Editions In 1924, the Unione Radiofonica Italiana (URI) was formed by private entrepreneurs and part of the Marconi group and granted the same year a monopoly of radio broadcasts. URI became the RAI after the war.  Firmer intervention  The lira continued to decline into 1926. It can be argued that this was not a bad thing for Italy since it resulted in cheaper and more competitive exports and more expensive imports. However, the declining lira was disliked politically. Mussolini apparently saw it as \\"a virility issue\\" and the decline was an attack on his prestige. In the Pesaro Speech of 18 August 1926, he began the \\"Battle for the Lira\\". Mussolini made a number of strong pronouncements and set his position of returning the lira to its 1922 level, \\"Quota 90\\". This policy was implemented through an extended deflation of the economy as the country rejoined the gold standard, the money supply was reduced and interest rates were raised. This action produced a sharp recession, which Mussolini took up as a sign of his assertion of power over \\"troublesome elements\\"‚Äîa slap to both capitalist speculators and trade unions. On a wider scale, the Fascist economic policy pushed the country towards the corporative state, an effort that lasted well into the war. The idea was to create a national community where the interests of all parts of the economy were integrated into a class-transcending unity. Some see the move to corporatism in two phases. First, the workers were brought to heel over 1925‚Äì1927. Initially, the non-fascist trade unions and later (less forcefully) the fascist trade unions were nationalized by Mussolini's administration and placed under state ownership, conforming to Vladimir Lenin's earlier policies to eliminate independent labor unions in the Soviet Union.Samuel Gompers and William English Walling, Out of Their Own Mouths: A Revelation and an Indictment of Sovietism, New York: NY, E.P Dutton and Company, 1921, p. 76.Edmund Clingan, Introduction to Modern Western Civilization, Bloomington: IN, iUnivere, 2011, p. 207 Under this labor policy, Fascist Italy enacted laws to make union membership compulsory for all workers.Gaetano Salvemini, The Fate of Trade Unions Under Fascism, Chap. 3: \\"Italian Trade Unions Under Fascism\\", 1937, p. 35 This was a difficult stage as the trade unions were a significant component of Italian fascism from its radical syndicalist roots and they were also a major force in Italian industry. The changes were embodied in two key developments. The Pact of the Vidoni Palace in 1925 brought the fascist trade unions and major industries together, creating an agreement for the industrialists to only recognise certain unions and so marginalise the non-fascist and socialist trade unions. The Syndical Laws of 1926 (sometimes called the Rocco Laws after Alfredo Rocco) took this agreement a step further as in each industrial sector there could be only one trade union and employers organisation. Labour had previously been united under Edmondo Rossoni and his General Confederation of Fascist Syndical Corporations, giving him a substantial amount of power even after the syndical laws, causing both the industrialists and Mussolini himself to resent him. Thereby, he was dismissed in 1928 and Mussolini took over his position as well.Roland Sarti, Fascism and the Industrial Leadership in Italy, 1919-40: A Study in the Expansion of Private Power Under Fascism, 1968 Only these syndicates could negotiate agreements, with the government acting as an \\"umpire\\". The laws made both strikes and lock-outs illegal and took the final step of outlawing non-fascist trade unions. Despite strict regimentation, the labour syndicates had the power to negotiate collective contracts (uniform wages and benefits for all firms within an entire economic sector).Sarti, 1968 Firms that broke contracts usually got away with it due to the enormous bureaucracy and difficulty in solving labour disputes, primarily due to the significant influence the industrialists had over labour affairs. Employer syndicates had a considerable amount of power as well. Membership within these associations was compulsory and the leaders had the power to control and regulate production practices, distribution, expansion and other factors with their members. The controls generally favoured larger enterprises over small producers, who were dismayed that they had lost a significant amount of individual autonomy. Since the syndical laws kept capital and labour separate, Mussolini and other party members continued to reassure the public that this was merely a stop-gap and that all associations would be integrated into the corporate state at a later stage.  The corporative phase  From 1927, these legal and structural changes led into the second phase, the corporative phase. The Labour Charter of 1927 confirmed the importance of private initiative in organising the economy while still reserving the right for state intervention, most notably in the supposedly complete fascist control of worker hiring. In 1930, the National Council of Corporations was established and it was for representatives of all levels of the twenty-two key elements of the economy to meet and resolve problems. In practice, it was an enormous bureaucracy of committees that while consolidating the potential powers of the state resulted in a cumbersome and inefficient system of patronage and obstructionism. One consequence of the Council was the fact that trade unions held little to no representation whereas organized business, specifically organized industry (CGII), was able to gain a foothold over its competitors. A key effect that the Council had on the economy was the rapid increase in cartels, especially the law passed in 1932, allowing the government to mandate cartelization. The dispute was sparked when several industrial firms refused CGII orders to cartelize, prompting the government to step in. Since the corporations cut across all sectors of production, mutual agreements and cartelization was a natural reaction. Hence in 1937, over two-thirds of cartels authorized by the state, many of which crossed sectors of the economy, had started after the founding of the Council, resulting in the noticeable increase in commercial- industrial cartelization. Cartels generally undermined the corporative agencies that were meant to ensure they operated according to Fascist principles and in the national interest, but the heads were able to show that cartel representatives had total control over the individual firms in the distribution of resources, prices, salaries and construction. Businessmen usually argued in favour of \\"collective self-regulation\\" being within Fascist ideological lines when forming cartels, subtly undermining corporative principles. Government intervention in industry was very uneven as large programs started, but with little overarching direction. Intervention began with the \\"Battle of the Grain\\" in 1925 when the government intervened following the poor harvest to subsidise domestic growers and limit foreign imports by increasing taxes. This reduced competition and created, or sustained, widespread inefficiencies. According to historian Denis Mack Smith (1981), \\"[s]uccess in this battle was [...] another illusory propaganda victory won at the expense of the Italian economy in general and consumers in particular\\", continuing that \\"[t]hose who gained were the owners of the Latifondia and the propertied classes in general [...] his policy conferred a heavy subsidy on the Latifondisti\\".Denis Mack Smith (1981), Mussolini. Larger programs began in the 1930s with the Bonifica Integrale land reclamation program (or so-called \\"Battle for Land\\"), which was employing over 78,000 people by 1933; the Mezzogiorno policies to modernise southern Italy and attack the Mafia as per capita income in the south was still 40% below that of the north; the electrification of the railways and similar transport programs; hydroelectrical projects; and the chemical industry, automobiles and steel. There was also limited takeover of strategic areas, notably oil with the creation of Agip (Azienda Generale Italiana Petroli‚ÄîGeneral Italian Oil Company).  The Great Depression  The worldwide depression of the early 1930s hit Italy very hard starting in 1931. As industries came close to failure they were bought out by the banks in a largely illusionary bail- out‚Äîthe assets used to fund the purchases were largely worthless. This led to a financial crisis peaking in 1932 and major government intervention. After the bankruptcy of the Austrian Kredit Anstalt in May 1931, Italian banks followed, with the bankruptcy of the Banco di Milano, the Credito Italiano and the Banca Commerciale. To support them, the state created three institutions funded by the Italian Treasure, with the first being the Sofindit in October 1931 (with a capital of 500 million liras), which bought back all the industrial shares owned by the Banca Commerciale and other establishments in trouble. In November 1931 the IMI (capital of 500 million liras) was also created and it issued five and one-half billion liras in state obligations as reimbursables in a period of ten years. This new capital was lent to private industry for a maximum period of ten years. Finally, the Institute for Industrial Reconstruction (IRI) formed in January 1933 and took control of the bank-owned companies, suddenly giving Italy the largest industrial sector in Europe that used government-linked companies (GLC). At the end of 1933, it saved the Hydroelectric Society of Piemont, whose shares had fallen from 250 liras to 20 liras‚Äîwhile in September 1934, the Ansaldo trust was again reconstituted under the authority of the IRI, with a capital of 750 million liras. Despite this taking of control of private companies through (GLC), the Fascist state did not nationalize any company. Not long after the creation of the Institute for Industrial Reconstruction, Mussolini boasted in a 1934 speech to his Chamber of Deputies: \\"Three-fourths of the Italian economy, industrial and agricultural, is in the hands of the state\\".Gianni Toniolo, editor, The Oxford Handbook of the Italian Economy Since Unification, Oxford: UK, Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 59; Mussolini‚Äôs speech to the Chamber of Deputies was on May 26, 1934Carl Schmidt, The Corporate State in Action, London: Victor Gollancz Ltd., 1939, pp. 153‚Äì76 As Italy continued to nationalize its economy, the IRI \\"became the owner not only of the three most important Italian banks, which were clearly too big to fail, but also of the lion‚Äôs share of the Italian industries\\".Costanza A. Russo, ‚ÄúBank Nationalizations of the 1930s in Italy: The IRI Formula‚Äù, Theoretical Inquiries in Law, Vol. 13:407 (2012), p. 408 Mussolini's economic policies during this period would later be described as \\"economic dirigisme\\", an economic system where the state has the power to direct economic production and allocation of resources.Iv√°n T. Berend, An Economic History of Twentieth- Century Europe, New York: NY, Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 93 The economic conditions in Italy, including institutions and corporations gave Mussolini sufficient power to engage with them as he could. Although there were economic issues in the country, the approaches used in addressing them in the fascist era included political intervention measures, which ultimately could not effectively solve the strife. An already bad situation ended up being worse since the solutions presented were largely intended to increase political power as opposed to helping the affected citizens. These measures played a critical role in aggravating the conditions of the great depression in Italy. By 1939, Fascist Italy attained the highest rate of state ownership of an economy in the world other than the Soviet Union,Patricia Knight, Mussolini and Fascism: Questions and Analysis in History, New York: Routledge, 2003, p. 65 where the Italian state \\"controlled over four-fifths of Italy's shipping and shipbuilding, three-quarters of its pig iron production and almost half that of steel\\".Martin Blinkhorn, Mussolini and Fascist Italy, 2nd edition, New York: NY, Routledge, 1991, p. 26 IRI also did rather well with its new responsibilities‚Äîrestructuring, modernising and rationalising as much as it could. It was a significant factor in post-1945 development. However, it took the Italian economy until 1955 to recover the manufacturing levels of 1930‚Äîa position that was only 60% better than that of 1913.  After Depression  As Mussolini's ambitions grew, domestic policy was subsumed by foreign policy, especially the push for autarky after the 1935 invasion of Abyssinia and the subsequent trade embargoes. The push for independence from foreign strategic materials was expensive, ineffective and wasteful. It was achieved by a massive increase in public debt, tight exchange controls and the exchange of economic dynamism for stability. Recovery from the postwar slump had begun before Mussolini came to power, and later growth rates were comparatively weaker. From 1929 to 1939, the Italian economy grew by 16%, roughly half as fast as the earlier liberal period. Annual growth rates were 0.5% lower than prewar rates, and the annual rate of growth of value was 1% lower. Despite the efforts directed at industry, agriculture was still the largest sector of the economy in 1938, and only a third of total national income was derived from industry. Agriculture still employed 48% of the working population in 1936 (56% in 1921), industrial employment had grown only 4% over the period of fascist rule (24% in 1921 and 28% in 1936), and there was more growth in traditional than in modern industries. The rate of gross investment actually fell under Mussolini, and the move from consumer to investment goods was low compared to the other militaristic economies. Attempts to modernise agriculture were also ineffective. Land reclamation and the concentration on grains came at the expense of other crops, producing very expensive subsidised wheat while cutting more viable and economically rewarding efforts. Most evidence suggests that rural poverty and insecurity increased under fascism, and their efforts failed markedly to create a modern, rational agricultural system. In the late 1930s, the economy was still too underdeveloped to sustain the demands of a modern militaristic regime. Production of raw materials too small, and finished military equipment was limited in quantity and too often in quality. Although at least 10% of GDP, almost a third of government expenditure, began to be directed towards the armed services in the 1930s, the country was \\"spectacularly weak\\". Notably, the investment in the early 1930s left the services, especially the army, obsolete by 1940. Expenditures on conflicts from 1935 (such as commitments to the Spanish Civil War in 1936 to 1939 as well as the Italy-Albania War in 1939) caused little stockpiling to occur for the much greater (World War II in 1940‚Äì1945).

Preetz has a population of about 16,000 and is the largest city in the district of Pl√∂n.  Geography  Preetz is located in a hilly area referred to as the Holsteinische Schweiz (Holstein Switzerland) with a number of lakes and forests surrounding the town. Lakes include the Postsee, Lanker See and the smaller Kirchsee in the centre of town, which forms part of the river Schwentine. There are multiple nature reserves around Preetz that attract tourists and locals alike for biking and hiking, especially in the summer months. History Preetz around 1895 The first mention of Preetz dates from the year 1185, when Ecbrecht Procensis writes about the location Poretz in the Versus de Vicelino. The origins of the name Preetz are said to be found in the Slavic term \\"po rece\\" (i.e., on the river). In 1221, the term \\"Poretzie\\" appeared, and in 1442 \\"Pretze\\". A first town church was built in 1210. In 1211, Count Albrecht von Orlam√ºnde established a Benedictine monastery: Preetz Priory. The foundation of the abbey was renewed by Adolf IV von Schauenburg in 1226, and it was given to nuns. In 1268, the nunnery church was built. The nunnery formed the highest administrative authority until 1867 and exercised jurisdiction as well. Preetz obtained street lighting in 1852. The station was built in 1864, the Council Hall in 1871. An oak tree in front of the Council Hall, which was planted in 1871, still exists.

In today's terms, the farm began a few feet (metres) south of 33rd Street and extended north to the middle of the block between 38th and 39th Street. At the southern end, the plot was rather narrow but at the northern end it went from approximately Lexington Avenue to a spot between Madison and Fifth Avenues.

There were several bad line calls that went against Riggs in this match. McNeill was the third player who managed to overcome a two-set deficit in the final of the U.S. Championships after Maurice McLoughlin (1912) and Bill Tilden (1922). His title wins in 1940 earned McNeill the No. 1 ranking in the USA at the end of the year. There were no \\"official\\" amateur rankings during World War II - McNeill reached as high as World No. 7 in Gordon Lowe's amateur rankings list in 1939.United States Lawn Tennis Association (1972). Official Encyclopedia of Tennis (First Edition), p. 425. During the war McNeill served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy and was attached to the embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina. While stationed there he won the Argentinian Championships in 1942 and defended the title successfully in November 1943, defeating Pancho Segura in the final. After the war McNeill decided to focus on his business career and played tournaments less frequently. In 1950 McNeill won his second U.S. Indoor title, twelve years after winning his first. This time in the final he was too strong for Fred Kovaleski, defeating him in four sets. Additionally he had been a runner-up in 1940 and 1946. Both Allison Danzig, in a New York Times article in 1936, and Pancho Segura, in a telephone interview in 2014, described McNeill's game as consisting of very heavily topspun drives off both wings, and Segura was of the opinion that McNeill didn't turn pro because there was really very little money in professional tennis then. He was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1965. After his tennis career he became an advertising executive in New York. McNeill died on November 28, 1996 in Vero Beach due to complications from pneumonia.

He specialized in biblical studies, particularly the New Testament, but he also made contributions to the study of the Dead Sea Scrolls and early Jewish literature. Life Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1920, Fitzmyer was admitted, on July 30, 1938, to the novitiate of the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus, commonly known as the Jesuits, in Wernersville, Pennsylvania. After completing that stage of his formation in the summer of 1940, he was sent to study at Loyola University in Chicago, Illinois, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree and then, in 1945, a Master of Arts degree in Greek. He then studied theology in the Facult√©s Saint-Albert (Egenhoven‚ÄìLouvain), Belgium, and was ordained a Catholic priest on August 15, 1951. He was granted a Licentiate of Sacred Theology (S.T.L.) by the Catholic University of Leuven in 1952, a doctorate in Semitics from the Johns Hopkins University in 1956, and a Licentiate in Sacred Scripture (S.S.L.) from the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome in 1957. From 1958 to 1969, Fitzmyer taught New Testament and biblical languages at Woodstock College. From 1969 to 1971, he taught Aramaic and Hebrew at the University of Chicago and then New Testament and biblical languages at Fordham University (1971‚Äì1974), at Weston School of Theology in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1974‚Äì1976), and finally in the Department of Biblical Studies at The Catholic University of America (1976‚Äì1986) as Professor of New Testament until his retirement. His publications covered Scripture, theology, Christology, catechesis, and the Dead Sea Scrolls. A co-editor of the New Jerome Biblical Commentary, he also served as president of the Catholic Biblical Association of America (1969‚Äì1970), of the Society of Biblical Literature (1979), and of the Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas (1992‚Äì1993). Fitzmyer, the Speaker's Lecturer at the University of Oxford in 1974‚Äì1975, was the 1984 recipient of the Burkitt Medal of the British Academy, and he served on the Pontifical Biblical Commission from 1984 to 1995. Fitzmyer was a member of the Jesuit community at Georgetown University, Washington, DC. He died in Merion, Pennsylvania, on December 24, 2016. Scholarship Fitzmyer contributed to several biblical commentaries, including the Jerome Biblical Commentary, the New Jerome Biblical Commentary, and the Anchor Bible Commentary. His contribution to the Anchor Bible Commentary included work on The Gospel of Luke (in two volumes), Acts of the Apostles, 1 Corinthians, Romans, and Philemon. In the New Jerome Biblical Commentary, he has articles introducing the New Testament Epistles, Galatians, Romans, Philemon and on the history of Israel as well as Paul and Pauline theology. In the last one, after a historical review of 40 themes, he concludes: > As Christ was \\"the image of the God\\" (2 Cor 4:4) so human beings are > destined to be \\"the image of the heavenly man\\" (1 Cor 15:49; cf. Rom 8:29). > [Through] growth in Christ ... the Christian lives his or her life \\"for God\\" > (Gal 2:19). Thus, for all his emphasis on Christ, Paul once again refers > Christian existence ultimately to the Father ‚Äì through Christ. Fitzmyer published three commentaries on Romans: The Jerome Biblical Commentary (1968), The New Jerome Biblical Commentary (1989), and the Anchor Bible Commentary (1993). The last work runs over 800 pages, and from it came a very practical and spiritually accessible work, Spiritual Exercises Based on Paul's Epistle to the Romans. The creative endeavor links biblical commentary and exegeses with modern spirituality. In it, Fitzmyer lays out his interpretation of Romans in a more condensed form. Using historical and rhetorical criticism, Paul's Jewish background and Graeco-Roman setting fail to prevent Fitzmyer from seeing coherency in Paul's message. While some scholars argue that Paul's theology is largely dependent on its context, such as the crisis in the Corinthian community, Fitzmyer argues for a vital application of Romans to our modern context. In his The Impact of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Fitzmyer summarizes in the book his 50 years of research as a pioneer in the field.

He was the No. 1-ranked American player in 1942; the No. 2 for 4 consecutive years, 1946 through 1949, and the latter year saw Schroeder ranked World No. 1 by Pierre Gillou (president of the F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise de Tennis). He was born in Newark, New Jersey, but developed as a tennis player in Southern California under the guidance of Perry T. Jones. Early life and career Schroeder was born in Newark, NJ but moved to Glendale in his childhood where he learned to play tennis. He was discovered by Perry T. Jones who was based at the Los Angeles Tennis Club and mentored several world-class players including Ellsworth Vines, Bobby Riggs and Jack Kramer. Schroeder was an almost exact contemporary of Kramer, having been born only 10 days earlier in 1921, and they began to play against each other as top boy players in the mid-1930s. Schroeder's career is similar to Kramer's in that they both became top players whose careers were then interrupted by World War II. They were also lifelong friends and at least once Schroeder mortgaged his house on short notice in order to be able to lend an unsolicited $25,000 to Kramer. Schroeder, however, attended college for four years, the first two at the University of Southern California (USC), and the last two at Stanford University. After the war Kramer proved himself to be slightly better than Schroeder in the amateur ranks and subsequently turned professional. 'Lucky Ted' When Riggs semi-retired he became the promoter of the professional tour. He and Kramer decided that the only player who could oppose Kramer for a financially successful tour would be Schroeder. The youthful Pancho Gonzales was the reigning American amateur champion, due to his upset win at the U.S. Open Championships in 1948, but during his brief career had been beaten by Schroeder eight matches out of nine. Schroeder, playing during vacation time from his job, won Wimbledon in June 1949, winning some tough matches along the way. Schroeder was two sets down against Gardnar Mulloy in round one and then had five set wins against Frank Sedgman, Eric Sturgess and Jaroslav Drobny in the quarters, semis and final. According to his obituary in the New York Times, he . . . Professional hope Following his Wimbledon victory, Riggs and Kramer offered Schroeder $25,000 to turn pro after he won the up-coming 1949 U.S. Championships and Schroeder accepted. But Gonzales upset their plans by beating the heavily favored Schroeder in a five- set final ‚Äî it has been called the 11th greatest match of all time.Tennis Magazine, on page 330 of The Tennis Book, Edited by Michael Bartlett and Bob Gillen Gonzales lost the 1-hour and 15-minute first set 16‚Äì18 but finally managed to prevail in the fifth set. Kramer writes that in spite of his friendship with Schroeder, he has always felt that Schroeder subconsciously \\"tanked\\" the match, in order to avoid the rigors of the professional tour. In any event, Gonzales was now the two-time American champion and Kramer and Riggs were obliged to sign him, instead of Schroeder, to a professional contract. Post-war Schroeder was never much more than a part-time player after the War, being preoccupied with his family and his career as vice president of a commercial refrigeration equipment company, and had never really intended to turn professional. Schroeder said he took his tennis far too emotionally to allow him to treat it as a profession. He remained a successful amateur player for a few more years and then faded from view. He died in La Jolla, California at the age of 84. His son, John, is a professional golfer who has won on the PGA Tour. Abilities In his 1979 autobiography, the long-time tennis promoter and great player Jack Kramer included Schroeder in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time.Writing in 1979, Kramer considered the best ever to have been either Don Budge (for consistent play) or Ellsworth Vines (at the height of his game). The next four best were, chronologically, Bill Tilden, Fred Perry, Bobby Riggs, and Pancho Gonzales. After these six came the \\"second echelon\\" of Rod Laver, Lew Hoad, Ken Rosewall, Gottfried von Cramm, Ted Schroeder, Jack Crawford, Pancho Segura, Frank Sedgman, Tony Trabert, John Newcombe, Arthur Ashe, Stan Smith, Bj√∂rn Borg, and Jimmy Connors. He felt unable to rank Henri Cochet and Ren√© Lacoste accurately but felt they were among the very best. Schroeder, says Kramer, \\"won with heart and stamina, but lacked in the simple mechanics.\\" Kramer writes, Schroeder was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1966, two years before his old friend Jack Kramer.

This is more flexible than shared hosting, as organizations have full control over the server(s), including choice of operating system, hardware, etc. There is also another level of dedicated or managed hosting commonly referred to as complex managed hosting. Complex Managed Hosting applies to both physical dedicated servers, Hybrid server and virtual servers, with many companies choosing a hybrid (combination of physical and virtual) hosting solution. There are many similarities between standard and complex managed hosting but the key difference is the level of administrative and engineering support that the customer pays for ‚Äì owing to both the increased size and complexity of the infrastructure deployment. The provider steps in to take over most of the management, including security, memory, storage and IT support. The service is primarily proactive in nature.‚ÄúInternet Infrastructure Technology‚Äù Structure Research, Sept 5, 2012 Server administration can usually be provided by the hosting company as an add-on service. In some cases a dedicated server can offer less overhead and a larger return on investment. Dedicated servers are hosted in data centers, often providing redundant power sources and HVAC systems. In contrast to colocation, the server hardware is owned by the provider and in some cases they will provide support for operating systems or applications. Using a dedicated hosting service offers the benefits of high performance, security, email stability, and control. Due to the relatively high price of dedicated hosting, it is mostly used by websites that receive a large volume of traffic. Operating system support Availability, price and employee familiarity often determines which operating systems are offered on dedicated servers. Variations of Linux and Unix (open source operating systems) are often included at no charge to the customer. Commercial operating systems include Microsoft Windows Server, provided through a special program called Microsoft SPLA. Red Hat Enterprise is a commercial version of Linux offered to hosting providers on a monthly fee basis. The monthly fee provides OS updates through the Red Hat Network using an application called Yum. Other operating systems are available from the open source community at no charge. These include CentOS, Fedora Core, Debian, and many other Linux distributions or BSD systems FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD. Support for any of these operating systems typically depends on the level of management offered with a particular dedicated server plan. Operating system support may include updates to the core system in order to acquire the latest security fixes, patches, and system-wide vulnerability resolutions. Updates to core operating systems include kernel upgrades, service packs, application updates, and security patches that keep the server secure and safe. Operating system updates and support relieves the burden of server management from the dedicated server owner. Bandwidth and connectivity Bandwidth refers to the data transfer rate or the amount of data that can be carried from one point to another in a given time period (usually a second) and is often represented in bits (of data) per second (bit/s). =95th percentile method= Line speed, billed on the 95th percentile, refers to the speed in which data flows from the server or device, measured every 5 minutes for the month, and dropping the top 5% of measurements that are highest, and basing the usage for the month on the next- highest measurement. This is similar to a median measurement, which can be thought of as a 50th percentile measurement (with 50% of measurements above, and 50% of measurements below), whereas this sets the cutoff at 95th percentile, with 5% of measurements above the value, and 95% of measurements below the value. This is also known as Burstable billing. Line speed is measured in bits per second (or kilobits per second, megabits per second or gigabits per second). =Unmetered method= The second bandwidth measurement is unmetered service where providers cap or control the ‚Äútop line‚Äù speed for a server. Top line speed in unmetered bandwidth is the total Mbit/s allocated to the server and configured on the switch level. Unmetered bandwidth services usually incur an additional charge. =Total transfer method= Some providers will calculate the Total Transfer, which is the measurement of actual data leaving and arriving, measured in bytes. Although it is typically the sum of all traffic into and out of the server, some providers measure only outbound traffic (traffic from the server to the internet). =Bandwidth pooling= One of the reasons for choosing to outsource dedicated servers is the availability of high powered networks from multiple providers. As dedicated server providers utilize massive amounts of bandwidth, they are able to secure lower volume based pricing to include a multi-provider blend of bandwidth. To achieve the same type of network without a multi-provider blend of bandwidth, a large investment in core routers, long term contracts, and expensive monthly bills would need to be in place. The expenses needed to develop a network without a multi-provider blend of bandwidth does not make sense economically for hosting providers. Many dedicated server providers include a service level agreement based on network up-time. Some dedicated server hosting providers offer a 100% up-time guarantee on their network. By securing multiple vendors for connectivity and using redundant hardware, providers are able to guarantee higher up-times; usually between 99-100% up-time if they are a higher quality provider. One aspect of higher quality providers is they are most likely to be multi-homed across multiple quality up-link providers, which in turn, provides significant redundancy in the event one goes down in addition to potentially improved routes to destinations. Bandwidth consumption over the last several years has shifted from a per megabit usage model to a per gigabyte usage model. Bandwidth was traditionally measured in line speed access that included the ability to purchase needed megabits at a given monthly cost. As the shared hosting model developed, the trend towards gigabyte or total bytes transferred, replaced the megabit line speed model so dedicated server providers started offering per gigabyte. Management Dedicated hosting services primarily differ from managed hosting services in that managed hosting services usually offer more support and other services. As such, managed hosting is targeted towards clients with less technical knowledge, whereas dedicated hosting services, or unmanaged hosting services, are suitable for web development and system administrator professionals. To date, no industry standards have been set to clearly define the management role of dedicated server providers. What this means is that each provider will use industry standard terms, but each provider will define them differently. For some dedicated server providers, fully managed is defined as having a web based control panel while other providers define it as having dedicated system engineers readily available to handle all server and network related functions of the dedicated server provider. Server management can include some or all of the following: * Operating system updates * Application updates * Server monitoring * SNMP hardware monitoring * Application monitoring * Application management * Technical support * Firewall services * Anti-spam software * Antivirus updates * Security audits * DDoS protection and mitigation * Intrusion detection * Backups and restoration * Disaster recovery * DNS hosting service * Load balancing * Database administration * Performance tuning * Out-of-band Management * Software installation and configuration * User management * Programming consultation Dedicated hosting server providers define their level of management based on the services they provide. In comparison, fully managed could equal self managed from provider to provider. Administrative maintenance of the operating system, often including upgrades, security patches, and sometimes even daemon updates are included. Differing levels of management may include adding users, domains, daemon configuration, or even custom programming. Dedicated server hosting providers may provide the following types of server managed support: * Fully managed ‚Äì Includes monitoring, software updates, reboots, security patches and operating system upgrades. Customers are completely hands-off. * Managed ‚Äì Includes medium level of management, monitoring, updates, and a limited amount of support. Customers may perform specific tasks. * Self-managed ‚Äì Includes regular monitoring and some maintenance. Customers provide most operations and tasks on dedicated server. * Unmanaged ‚Äì Little to no involvement from service provider. Customers provide all maintenance, upgrades, patches, and security. Security Dedicated hosting server providers utilize extreme security measures to ensure the safety of data stored on their network of servers. Providers will often deploy various software programs for scanning systems and networks for obtrusive invaders, spammers, hackers, and other harmful problems such as Trojans, worms, and crashers (Sending multiple connections). Linux and Windows use different software for security protection. Software Providers often bill for dedicated servers on a fixed monthly price to include specific software packages. Over the years, software vendors realized the significant market opportunity to bundle their software with dedicated servers. They have since started introducing pricing models that allow dedicated hosting providers the ability to purchase and resell software based on reduced monthly fees. Microsoft offers software licenses through a program called the Service Provider License Agreement. The SPLA model provides use of Microsoft products through a monthly user or processor based fee. SPLA software includes the Windows Operating System, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft SharePoint and shoutcast hosting, and many other server based products. Other software applications available are specialized web hosting specific programs called control panels. Control panel software is an all- inclusive set of software applications, server applications, and automation tools that can be installed on a dedicated server. Control panels include integration into web servers, database applications, programming languages, application deployment, server administration tasks, and include the ability to automate tasks via a web based front end. Limitations Many providers do not allow IRC (bots, clients or daemons). This is due to rogue IRC users triggering DDoS attacks against the provider, which may overwhelm their networks, lowering service quality for all customers. * Adult content is disallowed by many providers as it may either be of questionable legality or consume large amounts of bandwidth. * Copyright violations ‚Äì Hosting copyrighted material of which an individual does not own the copyright to is against the terms of service of most hosting companies.

Miquita Oliver attended Holland Park School. In 2001, aged 16, she became presenter of the Channel 4 music show Popworld, co-presenting with Simon Amstell. The pair were known for employing a great deal of humour in interviews. They left the show in 2006, but Oliver continued to present the T4 strand. After an incident in mid-2010 in which Oliver was overheard insulting singer Kesha behind her back by Kesha's management, Oliver was suspended from T4 for six weeks and subsequently her contract was not renewed. She recorded her last T4 in December 2010. She has hosted shows on both BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra, notably covering for Sara Cox and Spoony. She left her early morning show Oneclick to focus on TV projects. In an interview with Heat magazine, Oliver said that she was sacked from BBC Radio 1 following a comment she made in an interview with NME magazine about Fearne Cotton, calling her a \\"Devil Woman\\". Oliver made a brief appearance in May 2007 on the BBC programme Neneh & Andi Dish It Up ‚Äì which is presented by her mother Andrea and \\"Auntie\\" Neneh Cherry ‚Äì and has also made appearances on political talk show This Week, on 25 June 2009 and 17 December 2009. In March 2010 Oliver made a programme for Channel 4's T4 called \\"Miquita's Oliver\\". She was set the challenge of starting a one-off urban production of the classic musical Oliver! from scratch. She had to cast it, script it and then direct it. The finished product was performed at the Hackney Empire to surprising critical acclaim. She then went on to have her own television show, called The Month With Miquita, which she hosted on the 4Music channel. She continued to present programmes for T4, such as T4 Movie Special in August 2011. In November 2011, Oliver filed for bankruptcy after non-payment of a tax bill.\\"Miquita Oliver faces bankruptcy over ¬£170,000 tax bill\\", London Evening Standard, 2 February 2012. Jenna Gregory, \\"Miquita Oliver Files for bankruptcy\\", Marie Claire, 3 February 2012.\\"Miquita Oliver facing bankruptcy over unpaid tax bill\\", Newsbeat, BBC Radio 1, 2 February 2012. In December 2013 she presented the programme Young, British and Broke: The Truth about Payday Loans on BBC Three. She said that her own experiences of bankruptcy made her passionate about making the show. Oliver's godmother is former Holby City actress Amanda Mealing. Oliver was a part of the four-part BBC TV series 24 Hours in the Past, along with Colin Jackson, Alistair McGowan, Ann Widdecombe, Tyger Drew-Honey and Zoe Lucker which went out between 28 April and 19 May 2015 on BBC One. =Miquita Does series= In 2009, Oliver hosted a Miquita Does series: #\\"Miquita Does American Boys\\" #\\"Miquita Does All-Time Floorfillers\\" #\\"Miquita Does Number 1s\\" #\\"Miquita Does Movies\\" #\\"Miquita Does Pop\\" #\\"Miquita Does Power Ballads\\" #\\"Miquita Does Urban Anthems\\" Fashion In 2008 Miquita Oliver along with vinspired.com helped launch Fashion Favours, a collection of reworked fashion items, customised by volunteers from around the UK. On 25 September 2008, to promote fashion favours, Miquita modelled Prime Minister Gordon Brown's shirt. On 25 June 2009, Oliver appeared on political talk show This Week to discuss issues relating to fashion including Speaker John Bercow's decision not to wear the traditional robes,Andrew Sparrow, \\"John Bercow abandons traditional dress as he begins Speaker role\\", The Guardian, 23 June 2009.] and French President Nicolas Sarkozy's decision to ban the burqa in France.Angelique Chrisafis (in Paris), \\"Nicolas Sarkozy says Islamic veils are not welcome in France\\", The Guardian, 22 June 2009.] References External links * *4Music profile Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:People from Paddington Category:English television presenters Category:Black English television personalities Category:People educated at Holland Park School Category:English people of Antigua and Barbuda descent ","title":"Miquita Oliver"},{"id":"2200009","text":"Dollywaggon Pike is a fell in the English Lake District. It stands on the main spine of the Helvellyn range in the Eastern Fells, between Thirlmere and the Ullswater catchment. Name The spelling ‚ÄòDollywaggon‚Äô is used on Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 maps but ‚ÄòDollywagon‚Äô on 1:50,000 maps. The Ordnance Survey gazetteer, nominally based on the 1:50,000 maps, lists only ‚ÄòDollywaggon Pike‚Äô. As of 2005, the ‚ÄòDollywagon‚Äô spelling is slightly more common in online references. Alfred Wainwright used ‚ÄòDollywaggon Pike‚Äô in his Pictorial Guide, a position supported by other writers.Richards, Mark: Near Eastern Fells: Collins (2003): Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): One etymology for the word Dollywaggon gives an Old Norse source formed by the combination of ' (‚Äòfiend‚Äô or ‚Äògiant‚Äô) and veginn (‚Äòlifted‚Äô).A. Harry Griffin. The Guardian, Country Diary. (4 July 1994). Topography Map showing Dollywaggon Pike and surrounding features from 1925. The Helvellyn range runs broadly north‚Äìsouth for about 7 miles, remaining above 2,000 ft (600 m) throughout its length. Dollywaggon Pike is the southernmost fell of the ridge proper, with Nethermost Pike immediately to the north. There is a subsidiary top between Nethermost and Dollywaggon Pikes named High Crag (2,990 ft / 884 m). Due to the very limited depression between the two, most guidebooks follow WainwrightAlfred Wainwright:A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 1: in counting High Crag as a part of Nethermost Pike. To the south of Dollywaggon Pike is the complex depression containing Grisedale Tarn, with Seat Sandal and Fairfield rising beyond. In common with much of the Helvellyn range there is a marked contrast between the western and eastern slopes of Dollywaggon Pike. In Wainwright‚Äôs words ‚ÄòTo the west, uninteresting grass slopes descend to Dunmail Raise almost unrelieved by rock and scarred only by the wide stony track gouged across the breast of the fell by the boots of generations of pilgrims to Helvellyn. But the eastern side is a desolation of crag and boulder and scree.‚Äô High Crag, often considered part of Nethermost Pike, seen from Dollywaggon Pike summit. The western flank is named Willie Wife Moor for reasons lost to antiquity. It is bounded by Birkside Gill to the north and Raise Beck to the south, Reggle Knott being the only area of rough ground. At the base of the slope Raise Beck flows north to Thirlmere, having been diverted as a part of the 1884 reservoir project. It previously turned south down the other side of Dunmail Raise pass to feed Grasmere. Before this diversion, Dollywaggon Pike was distinctive in that its drainage reached the sea at more widely spread points than any other Lakeland Fell, with Raise Beck going through Grasmere and Windermere to reach Morecambe Bay, Birkside Gill going through Thirlmere and Derwent Water to reach the Irish Sea at Workington and Grisedale Beck draining into Ullswater and then to the sea at the Solway Firth. This is still the case today when there is enough water in Raise Beck for it to flow both north and south, but normally Seat Sandal now has this distinction. Birkside Gill contains the remains of a number of levels driven for copper between 1840 and 1866.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells, Dalesman (1995); On the east, the first impression is all of rock. The long strath of Grisedale runs north-eastward to Ullswater, cutting off a series of hanging valleys which fall from the Helvellyn range. To the north- east of Dollywaggon Pike, below the summit of High Crag, is Ruthwaite Cove, a corrie surrounded on three sides by crag. Ruthwaite Cove is now the site of Ruthwaite Lodge, a climbing hut. It was formerly the setting for more industrious activity, with the remains of several levels and some shallow open mineworking being visible near the Lodge. These excavations were made for lead-bearing galena, and are believed to have been worked in the sixteenth century. Further leases were taken out in 1784 and 1862, the last-known operation being in 1880. To the east of Dollywaggon Pike is a second corrie, Cock Cove, with Falcon Crag and the deeply gullied Tarn Crag providing the impressive headwall.Cock Cove seen from The Tongue on Dollywaggon Pike. Between the two coves, Dollywaggon Pike sends out a fine rocky ridge, The Tongue. This ar√™te ascends by a series of rocky steps making straight for the summit. At the bottom of The Tongue is Spout Crag, standing above Grisedale Beck and forcing walkers to take a detour from the ridgeline. North of Dollywaggon Pike the ridge narrows and then steps up over High Crag to the plateau top of Nethermost Pike. In the other direction the high ground curves south-east around Cock Cove before a long slope falls to Grisedale Tarn at around 1,770 ft (539 m). This sizeable tarn has a depth of around 110 ft (34 m) and holds brown trout, perch and eels.Blair, Don: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): The outflow is to Ullswater to the north east, picking up all of the rainfall from the eastern face of Dollywaggon Pike. To the west of the tarn is the unnamed col between Dollywaggon Pike and Seat Sandal and immediately to the south is Grisedale Hause, the depression between Seat Sandal and Fairfield. Thus Seat Sandal stands topographically on the ridge between the two higher fells, but so out on a limb that many walkers proceed directly from Dollywaggon Pike to Fairfield. Geology Geologically the summit of the fell forms part of the Deepdale Formation, (principally volcaniclastic sandstone) underlain by the dacitic lapilli-tuff of the Helvellyn Formation.Woodhall, DG: Geology of the Keswick District- a brief explanation of the geological map. 1:50,000 Sheet 29: British Geological Survey (2000) Summit The summit is a small grassy rise directly at the head of The Tongue. It carries a small cairn with a larger one a few yards to the west. The view is extensive with the eastern foreground particularly fine Ascents The Tongue provides a fine route of ascent, though a long one, from Patterdale and the fell can also be reached from the Grasmere area via Grisedale Tarn. Ascents up the western slopes are unimpeded but uninteresting.

He is said to have been a chaplain to both Elizabeth I and James I. Early life and education George Downame was a son of William Downame, Bishop of Chester, and an elder brother of John Downame. He matriculated at Christ‚Äôs College, Cambridge, in November 1581, graduated B.A. in 1584/5, obtained the further degree of B.D. in 1595, and was made D.D. in 1601.John Peile (compiler), Biographical Register of Christ‚Äôs College 1505-1905, Vol.I, 1448-1665, Cambridge University Press, 1910, p. 166. In the early 1580s he was, although a bishop‚Äôs son, briefly a \\"zealous espouser of puritan principles\\" and it was only after \\"mature study\\" that he \\"heartily embraced episcopy\\".John Strype, Annals of the Reformation and establishment of Religion during Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs Reign, New Edition, Clarendon Press, 1824, Vol. III, Part I, pp. 719-720; Peter Ivan Kaufman, The Godly, Godlier and Godliest, The Elizabethan World (ed. Susan Doran, Norman Jones), Routledge, 2014, pp. 245-247. Heated debate among Fellows of Christ‚Äôs on such matters in the 1580s may account for the conformist Richard Clerke, a future translator of the King James Version, having been charged with striking the more radical Downame: see the entry for Richard Clerke at kingjamesbibletranslators.org. Career to 1601 Downame was elected a Fellow of Christ‚Äôs College, Cambridge in 1587 and shortly afterwards was chosen to be Professor of Logic in the University. Thomas Fuller considered \\"no man was then and there better skilled in Aristotle or a greater follower of Ramus\\".Thomas Fuller, The History of the Worthies of England, New Edition (ed. F. Austin Nuttall), Vol. I, 1840, p. 291. Fuller classed Downame (rendered \\"Dounham\\") as \\"the top-twig of the branch\\" in the Aristotelian-Ramist school of thought. The supremacy of Aristotle in the study of Logic (or Dialectics) was in decline and the writings of Petrus Ramus became increasingly dominant, in large part due to Downame‚Äôs role as \\"the Cambridge apostle\\" for Ramus‚Äôs approach.Augustus de Morgan, \\"On the Syllogism III, and on Logic in General\\", Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, Vol. X (1864), p. 181 (reprinted in On the Syllogism and Other Logical Writings, Routledge, 1966, p. 84). It is likely the dominance of Ramus at Cambridge did not long outlive Downame‚Äôs personal career there: ibid. In 1601 he published an 800-page commentary on Ramus‚Äôs 95-page Dialecticae,Commentarius in Rami Dialecticam. First publication was at Frankfurt, where four more editions were printed between 1605 and 1631; the first London edition dates from 1669: Jameela Lares, \\"The Ghost of Rhetoric: Milton‚Äôs Logic and the Renaissance Trivium\\", in A Concise Companion to the Study of Manuscripts, Printed Books and the Production of Early Modern Texts, ed. Edward Jones, John Wiley & Sons, 2015, p.194. the eloquence of Downame so opening the \\"clenched fist\\" of the subject matter as to \\"smooth and stroke one with the palm thereof\\".Fuller, The History of the Worthies of England. By 1593 he was Divinity Lecturer at St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, where he held the prebend of Caddington Major, and on appointment to the vicarage of Sandbach in the following year he also became a prebendary of Chester. In September 1596 he was preferred by Elizabeth I to the rectory of St Margaret‚Äôs, Lothbury, continuing there until 1601 when his brother John succeeded him in the living.John Ingle Dredge, Dr George Downame, Bishop of Derry, Manchester, 1882, pp. 4-5. Among his parishioners at Lothbury was the diplomat Sir Henry Killigrew, to whom Downame dedicated the printed text of his Easter Sermon of 1602, declaring that \\"to your Worship, your loving brother and the virtuous Lady your wife I am for great benefits exceedingly bound\\".Downame, \\"Abraham‚Äôs Tryall: a Sermon preached at the Spittle in Easter weeke, Anno Domini 1602\\", London, 1602. Sir Henry‚Äôs brother, Sir William Killigrew, was also influential at Court. Both Sir Henry and his brother Sir William Killigrew were on intimate terms with the Earl of Essex, which may have contributed to Downame‚Äôs appointment as chaplain to the ill-fated Earl by 1599.In December 1599 Downame was summoned to explain himself to the Privy Council for publicly praying for the Earl, whose health and favour were both in decline: Notes and Queries, Second Series, Vol.II (1856), p. 61. He is said also to have served as a chaplain to Elizabeth IPeile, Biographical Register of Christ‚Äôs College; Downame‚Äôs father had been chaplain to Elizabeth before her succession. and James I. Henry Cotton, The Succession of the Prelates and Members of the Cathedral Bodies of Ireland, Hodges & Smith, Dublin, 1850, Vol. III, p. 317. Career from 1601 Downame held the rectory of Munden Magna, Hertfordshire, from 1601. While there he published the substance of his teaching at St Paul‚Äôs in successive volumes.Dredge, Dr George Downame, p. 5. These volumes included A Treatise concerning Antichrist (in two books), 1603, and Lectures on the XV Psalme, 1604, both dedicated to James I. Downame also prepared a Treatise on the Ten Commandments containing the sum of his lectures at St Paul‚Äôs; from this was extracted \\"Abstract on the Duties commanded and Sins forbidden in the Law of God\\", published in 1620: see Dredge, p. 12. In 1616 he was appointed Bishop of Derry.Cotton, The Succession of the Prelates and Members of the Cathedral Bodies of Ireland, giving the date of his presentment as 6 December 1616 followed by consecration in January 1617. The Ordnance Survey of the County of Londonderry, Vol. I, Dublin, 1837, p. 60, states his letter of appointment under the Privy Seal was dated 28 October and his patent 6 December 1616. His diocese, comprising 45 parishes, was potentially valuable but in a state of decay. Little remained of the fabric of its old cathedral and 34 of its churches were ruinous or roofless.Londonderry Sentinel, 14 July 1945. Downame‚Äôs own account of the condition of his See in 1622 survives in An Account of the State of the Diocese of Derry. This was very much his own work - written in the first person and with candid comment on personalities - and forms part of The Ulster Visitation Book preserved at Trinity College Dublin. Downame‚Äôs seventeen years as bishop saw the commencement and completion of Derry‚Äôs new Cathedral Church of St Columb (the first non-Roman Catholic cathedral to be built in Western Europe) and, following his failure to agree terms with the Irish Society for a suitable site within the city, he built a new Bishop‚Äôs Palace overlooking Lough Swilly at Fahan.David Dickson, Derry‚Äôs Backyard: The Barony of Inishowen 1650-1800, Donegal History and Society, eds. William Nolan and ors, Geography Publications, 1995, p. 412. Downame‚Äôs appointment to the See of Derry was a fitting sequel to the Church of Ireland‚Äôs adoption of its own confession of faith (the \\"Irish Articles\\") in the previous year. Although he had embraced the episcopalian tradition, his theology chimed with the Calvinist tone of the Irish Articles and he brought to Ireland a deep-seated antipathy and hostility to the Church of Rome, which he declared had been controlled by Antichrist since the accession of Boniface III as Pope in 607.George Downame, Treatise concerning Antichrist, divided into two books, the former proving that the Pope is Antichrist; the latter maintaining the same assertion against all the objections of Robert Bellarmine, Jesuit and Cardinal of the Church of Rome, London, 1603; and see Alan Ford, \\"Force and Fear of Punishment: Protestants and Religious Coercion in Ireland 1693-33\\", in \\"Enforcing Reformation in Ireland and Scotland 1580-1700\\", ed. Crawford Gribben and Elizabethanne Boran, Aldgate Press, Aldershot, 2006. His beliefs made him particularly acceptable to the Scots Presbyterian settlers in UlsterCharles Pastoor, Galen K. Johnson, Historical Dictionary of the Puritans, Scarecrow Press, 2007, p. 108. and he was vehement in opposing toleration of Roman Catholic practice. He spoke the Irish Bishops‚Äô declaration of opposition when preaching before Lord Deputy Falkland in April 1627, saying toleration made one \\"an accessory to superstition and idolatry and to the perdition of a seduced people\\".Samuel R. Gardiner, History of England from the Accession of James I to the Outbreak of Civil War, 1603-1642, New Edition, Longman Green & Company, London, 1891, Vol. VIII: 1635-1639, pp. 15-16. Catholic priests had a strong hold over the native population in Downame‚Äôs diocese\\"Though they be rude, ignorant and vicious fellows, yet carry the Natives after them\\": Downame‚Äôs assessment in the concluding section of his Visitation. and, in despair at the civil and military authorities‚Äô acquiescence in this, he obtained from Dublin a special commission allowing him to arrest and detain all within his jurisdiction who refused obedience to him on spiritual matters.Dredge, Dr George Downame, p. 6; Rev. John Graham (writing as \\"Statisticus\\"), \\"Desiderata Curiosa Derriana\\", No. 72, Londonderry Sentinel, 5 November 1842, citing Loftus No. 85, Trinity College Dublin; and see Alexander Gordon, Dictionary of National Biography, 1908-9, Vol.4, pp. 1300-1301 (entry for Downham or Downame, George). He favoured the appointment of clergy who could catechise and preach in Irish in those parishes where it was the most spoken language,Alexander Gordon, DNB, p. 1301. and it was perhaps on such account that Fuller declared \\"This learned bishop was the greatest beauty [of his diocese], endeavouring by gentleness to cicurate and civilise the wild Irish, and proved very successful therein\\".Fuller, The History of the Worthies of England. Final years In 1631, Downame published, at Dublin, The Covenant of Grace in which, observed Archbishop James Ussher, he \\"handleth at full the Controversy on Perseverence and the Certainty of Salvation\\".James Ussher to Dr Samuel Ward, 10 December 1630 (Richard Parr, The Life of the Most Reverend James Ussher, late Lord Archbishop of Armagh... with a Collection of three-hundred letters..., London, 1686, Letter CLIX at p. 438). Passages within this exposition (written in 1604) were in conflict with the Arminian tendencies of Archbishop William Laud who, in the King‚Äôs name, ordered all copies of the book to be seized. By the time Laud‚Äôs instruction reached Dublin, most copies had already been distributed.James Seaton Reid, History of the Presbyterian Church In Ireland, Waugh & Innes, Edinburgh, 1834, p. 163. Downame had arrived in Derry three years after agreement had been reached between the King and the City of London for the latter‚Äôs conduct of the Londonderry Plantation. The City‚Äôs progress with the enterprise was slow and in 1623 Sir Thomas Phillips was appointed to oversee reform of the Plantation. To encourage the Londoners‚Äô implementation of remedial work, their rents were sequestrated in 1625; the sequestration order was quashed in 1627 and a Royal Commission was established to investigate the Plantation‚Äôs progress and problems. Downame became actively involved in these events, being appointed one of the 1625 sequestrators and a member of the 1627 Commission.James Stevens Curl, The Londonderry Plantation 1609-1914, Phillimore, 1986, pp. 72-84. He died on 17 April 1634, aged 67, and was buried in his cathedral four days later.Dredge, Dr George Downame, p. 8, citing Funeral Certificate taken by Alban Leverett, Athlone Pursuivant. Downame‚Äôs marriage licence appears in London Marriage Licences 1521-1869, ed. Joseph Foster (Quaritch, 1887), column 416; it is dated 19 April 1617 and states his age as 50. Legacy Downame was one of the leading controversialists of his day, writing numerous treatises that were printed or reprinted after this death.Arthur T. Russell, Memorials of the Life and Works of Thomas Fuller, D.D., William Pickering, London, 1884, p. 138. His most enduring work was his Commentary on Ramus‚Äôs Dialecticae which, in original or digest form, was standard reading for students at both English and American universities in the late seventeenth century.See, e.g., Rick Kennedy and Thomas Knoles, \\"Increase Mather‚Äôs Catechismus Logicus: A Translation and an Analysis of the Role of a Ramist Catechism at Harvard\\", Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society, Vol. 109 (1999), pp. 150-151. In 1858 Augustus de Morgan, perhaps the leading British logician of the mid-19th century, could still acknowledge the book as \\"an excellent work\\".de Morgan, \\"On the Syllogism III, and on Logic in General\\". It provided the basis, and most of the text, for John Milton‚Äôs Art of Logic (1672) and, to the extent that exercises in logic are said to have played a part in shaping Milton‚Äôs other works, Downame‚Äôs thinking may have indirectly reached a wider audience.Thomas S. K. Scott-Craig, \\"The Craftsmanship and Theological Significance of Milton‚Äôs Art of Logic\\", Huntingdon Library Quarterly, No. 1 (1953), pp. 1-6. Computational analysis by Francine Lusignan (PhD thesis, University of Montreal, 1974) shows that about 82% of the first book of Milton‚Äôs Ars Logica and 73% of the second book are directly taken, without acknowledgement, from Downame: Gordon Campbell & ors, Milton and the Manuscript De Doctrina Christiana, Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 81. Downame‚Äôs library, including books that had been his father‚Äôs and more than one hundred volumes previously owned by his father-in-law William Harrison, forms an important part of the present Derry and Raphoe Diocese Library Collection.Joe McLaughlin, \\"A Bibliographical Archaeological Site\\", History Ireland, Vol. 17, No. 6 (2009), pp. 36-37. See also Nicholas Pickwoad's paper on the library. Family Downame was three times married. His first wife, Ann Harrison, was a daughter of the antiquarian William Harrison and bore him at least eleven children. She died on 18 March 1616, and on 20 April 1617 he married, at St Margaret‚Äôs, Lothbury, Jaell (n√©e de Peigne), the widow of Sir Henry Killigrew, being the \\"Virtuous Lady\\" whose benevolence Downame had acknowledged fifteen years earlier; the marriage, which was solemnised by his brother John, had been expected since the previous December.Letter of John Chamberlain to Sir Dudley Carleton, 7 December 1616: for which see 'James 1 - volume 89: December 1616', in Calendar of State Papers Domestic: James I, 1611-18, ed.

Jaell Downame was ill and made her will on 16 October 1617 but it was not proved until 1623.The National Archives, PROB11/161/378. Following her death the Bishop married Margery Roe, a natural daughter of Sir Nicholas Bagenal and widow of Sir Francis Roe of Co. Tyrone. Of Downame‚Äôs children, James (1611-81) became Dean of Armagh, Mary married George Downing (a Member of the Dublin Parliament of 1634), Jane married a son of Bishop Andrew Knox, Elizabeth married Major Dudley Phillips (son of Sir Thomas), and Dorothy became the wife of Rev. Charles Vaughan, D.D., Prebendary of Comber, Londonderry. All Downame‚Äôs marriages and the names of his children and their spouses were recorded in his Funeral Certificate of 1634.Dredge, Dr George Downame, pp. 8-9. Theological writings His A Treatise of Justification, published in 1633, was his outstanding work of theology.

It has about 5,200 inhabitants. The centre of the town is historically significant and is protected by law as urban monument zone. Administrative parts Villages of Hrbov, Janovice, Nov√© Dvory and Skr√Ω≈°ov are administrative parts of Poln√°. History =Middle Ages= Founded in the second half of the 12th century, it is first mentioned in a written document in 1242. At that time, there had already been a church in Poln√°. Originally, Poln√° was a forest collier settlement, and not far from it there was built a castle called Poln√°, originally Polmna. The town lies on the line between two historic Czech lands ‚Äì Bohemia and Moravia, therefore the town became an important mercantil and tactical point. Poln√° became the centre of Poln√° (later Poln√°-P≈ôibyslav) domain. During its existence, Poln√° was, most of the time, part of significant aristocrat families' property. After the lords of Poln√°, the lords of Lip√° owned the town, from the half of the 14th century Poln√° was owned by the lords of Pirken≈°tejn. During the Hussite Wars, Hynek Pt√°ƒçek of Pirken≈°tejn, a hussite nobleman, ruled over Poln√° and bought also the nearby town of P≈ôibyslav. Victor, son of the Czech king George of Podƒõbrady who bestowed Poln√° significant town rights and the coat of arms, got Poln√° by marriage with ≈Ωofie Pt√°ƒçkov√° (daughter of Hynek Pt√°ƒçek). =15th‚Äì18th century= In the 15th century, Trƒçeks of L√≠pa owned the town followed by the Wallensteins, lords of Hradec and ≈Ωejdlices of ≈†enfeld. In 1623 Rudolf ≈Ωejdlic's property was confiscated because of his revolt against the Emperor. All the domain was bought by cardinal Franti≈°ek of Ditrich≈°tejn who changed the town's privileges and the coat of arms. Poln√° belonged to the Ditrich≈°tejns' property almost 300 years. In the 17th century a Jewish community settled in Poln√°. In 1794 the castle (rebuilt to a chateau) burned down and was never completely restored again. =19th century= In the 19th century Poln√° was the centre of Czech culture for large locality and formed a counterbalance to the German-speaking city of Jihlava. In the half of the 19th century 6,500 people lived in Poln√°, which made it the third largest town in the Vysoƒçina Region (after Jihlava and T≈ôeb√≠ƒç). In August 1863, a tragedy took place in Poln√°. A giant fire destroyed 189 houses and 456 families lost their homes. Many baroque and renaissance houses were ruined. Many people moved from the town. The fact that the Northwest Railroad were built 6 kilometers far from Poln√° caused another economical decline of the town. Railroad Dobron√≠n- Poln√° was built in 1903 but since 1982 the passenger traffic does not carry on. The most significant incident of the 19th century was the murder of 19-year-old Ane≈æka Hr≈Øzov√° in the B≈ôezina forest. A Poln√° Jew, Leopold Hilsner, was wrongfully accused of the crime. Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk, later the first president of Czechoslovakia, engaged himself in this affair. =20th century= In 1906, the telephone network were installed in Poln√°. A power plant was built in 1911. During the World War II most of the Jewish community died in concentration camps. Only three Poln√° Jews survived the war. In 1949 Poln√° became part of the Havl√≠ƒçk≈Øv Brod District. In 1960, after another territorial reorganization it became part of the Jihlava District.

Also textile industry is present in the town. Culture Every second weekend in September, the so-called \\"carrot fun fair\\" or \\"carrot-bun fun fair\\" () is organized in Poln√°. Sights Poln√° Castle Kle≈°ter is a glen where there led an ancient merchant path from Moravia to Bohemia. Kle≈°ter is a unique technical landmark of the Middle Ages. It was about 500 m long, partially cut in a rock. Poln√° Castle was built approximately in 1320 on a point above the junction of the ≈†lapanka river and the Ochozsk√Ω brook. It was rebuilt to a large gothic castle. In the 15th century its rampart was extended (incl. three ponds; one of them, Peklo, meaning Hell, exists to date). After a fire in 1584 the castle was reconstructed to a renaissance chateau. In 1645 and 1647 it was burned down by Swedes. After a vast fire in 1794 it started to wasteaway. In recent days the chateau was repaired and today it serves as a branch of the Vysoƒçina Museum. Church of Assumption of the Virgin Mary was built between 1700 and 1705, the tower in 1714. Author of the project was Italian builder Domenico D'Angeli. The building is 63 m long, 26 m wide and 22 m high. Inside the church there is a rich stucco decoration, tapestry, 10 altars, a font of tin (1617) and an organ by Jan David Sieberg (it is the biggest organ preserved organ in the Czech lands). The tower was destroyed by the 1863 fire and rebuilt in 1895. It is 64 m high. Church of Saint Catherine was built in 1378‚Äì1389 by Jan Pt√°ƒçek of Pirken≈°tejn. In 1906‚Äì1910 fragments of wall frescoes from the 15th and 16th centuries were discovered. Jewish Town is situated south-east from the town's main square (Hus Square). There is a preserved and reconstructed synagoge there. The Jewish cemetery can be found north-west of the town. The oldest gravestones are from the 17th century, the youngest one is from 1940. Hus Square makes the centre of the town. On the square there are deanery with the \\"Kaplanka\\" building (the former seat of the vicariate), Baroque Trinity Column and \\"Hastrmanka\\" Fountain, colloquially called \\"Vodn√≠k\\" (water sprite).

Their aim is to enforce speed limits and red traffic lights by the use of cameras. They were initially established in 1999 as part of the National Safety Camera Scheme to enforce speed limits in the United Kingdom. Until April 2007, the partnerships were funded from penalties generated from the use of traffic enforcement cameras in each area, but subsequently time they have received road safety grants. Rationale The stated objective was to reduce deaths and serious injury on the roads by reducing the level and severity of speeding and red light running through deterring, detecting and enforcement of speed and red light offences using but not limited to camera technology and driver education programmes. The programme was started as part of the UK government's Road Safety Strategy that set targets of: * 40% reduction in deaths and serious injuries by 2010 (compared to the average of 1994-8) * 50% reduction in deaths and serious injuries of children. The reported casualty statistics 2009 showed that the 2009 figures for deaths and serious injuries were 44% lower than the 1994-8 average and deaths and serious injuries of children down by 61% on the 1994-8 average. A similar level of 10-year casualty reduction had been consistently achieved over each of the previous sixteen years, with a previous high of 43% in 1993 and the lowest recent figure being 38% in 2006.  History  The safety camera programme was announced with a press release in December 1999. Eight trial areas were announced which would begin a roll- out of a number of Safety Cameras. These areas were Cleveland, Essex, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Nottingham, South Wales, Strathclyde and Thames Valley. The announcement was in part the result of a report commissioned by the UK Department for Transport (DfT) to look at the differing effects of various strategies related to the deployment of speed cameras. The main finding of the report was that camera deployment can reduce drivers' speeds markedly and that cameras on the survey roads were perceived to be reasonably effective. The eight initial implementations began on 1 April 2000. The cameras were mainly to be placed in locations where there had been a significant number of casualties as a result of road accidents. One novelty in the partnerships was that the revenue raised by the cameras would be ring- fenced for investment back into the running and maintenance of the original cameras and investment in more cameras. In part this was a response to allegations that such cameras were being placed for revenue generation and not for safety reasons. From the start the partnerships were controversial with strong opinions both for and against the cameras. In December 2001 new regulations enforced a code of visibility for the cameras in order that they were always clearly seen by motorists. As of April 2006 there were thirty eight safety camera partnerships in England and Wales covering forty-one police force areas out of a total of forty-three (Durham and North Yorkshire are the exceptions). Similar arrangements exist in Scotland and Northern Ireland. As the cameras became more widespread the issue became more contentious politically. In particular motoring bodies began to question the effectiveness of speed cameras as a means for accident prevention. This created a demand for research showing whether or not the cameras were, in practice, effective at reducing deaths and injuries from road accidents. Four independent evaluation reports were commissioned by the DfT to address this. Since April 2007 however, an annual specific (although not ring fenced) 'road safety grant' which was no longer related to the number of penalties issued locally was given directly to the local authorities with a responsibility for road safety who were free to choose whether or not to re-invest this in their partnership. During 2007 a total of 1.26 million fixed penalties were issued, which was down 23% from the previous year.

Biography Wrenn was born in Highland Park, Illinois. Wrenn attended Harvard University, where he was a prominent quarterback on the football team. Wrenn was considered \\"one of Harvard's greatest all-around athletes,\\" a star player at football, ice hockey, and baseball. Wrenn played a small role in the formation of collegiate ice hockey in the United States. In the fall of 1892, Wrenn and fellow tennis champion (and doubles partner) Malcolm Greene Chace played in an international tennis tournament in Niagara Falls, New York. There they met some Canadian athletes who invited them to return the next winter to learn about their sport of ice hockey, which differed from the game of ice polo which was then played in American colleges. Wrenn and Chace gathered some friends from other northeast colleges including Cornell University and returned to Canada over Christmas break 1894-95 for a series of hockey matches. Each of the students returned to their respective campuses to promote the sport of ice hockey. Wrenn later played for the St. Nicholas Hockey Club. Wrenn won his tennis titles in 1893, 1894, 1896 and 1897 (losing out to Fred Hovey in 1895). In 1898, served in Cuba with Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. He contracted yellow fever while in Cuba. Wrenn played for the U.S. Davis Cup team in 1903 together with his brother George. In the final against the British Isles at the Longwood Cricket Club, Boston, MA they were defeated 1‚Äì4 and Wrenn lost both his singles matches against Reginald and Laurence Doherty as well as the doubles against the Doherty brothers. Wrenn was vice-president of the United States Tennis Association from 1902 until 1911 and president from 1912 until 1915. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1955. He was arrested in 1914 when the car he was driving ran over and killed Herbert George Loveday, the choir director of St Mary's Church, in Tuxedo Park, New York. Wrenn was exonerated when, according to The New York Times (May 21, 1914), \\"The Grand Jury, finding from testimony that the mechanism of the car had become disarranged, and the steering gear powerless, declined to find an indictment, and the complaint was dismissed.\\" Wrenn was an aviator in World War I. He died of Bright's disease at age 53, at his apartment in the Hotel Madison in New York City.

(6 May 1908 ‚Äì 1 October 1988) was an American cinematographer. He worked on more than 130 films during his 50-year career, collaborating multiple times with directors including Josef Von Sternberg, John Brahm, Henry Hathaway, Budd Boetticher, Raoul Walsh, Sam Peckinpah and Tom Gries. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography for The Caretakers (1963). He was married to Merle Oberon. Biography Ballard was born in Miami, Oklahoma in 1908. His mother was Cherokee. He attended the University of Oklahoma and the University of Pennsylvania and after graduating, he became a surveyor. Ballard began working on films at Paramount Studios in 1929 after dating a script woman there. He later joked in an interview that it was a three-day party at the home of actress Clara Bow that convinced him \\"this is the business for me\\". He began his career loading trucks at Paramount and trained to be a camera assistant. He was taken on as an assistant to Lee Garmes on Josef von Sternberg's Morocco (1930). Von Sternberg allowed him credit as a second cameraman on The Devil is a Woman (1935), and the two shared a Venice Film Festival award for Best Cinematography in 1935. Von Sternberg promoted him to director of photography on Crime and Punishment (1935) and The King Steps Out (1936), based on the life of Empress Elisabeth of Austria, both at Columbia Pictures. After filming Dorothy Arzner's Craig's Wife also at Columbia, he settled into making B movies such as The Devil's Playground (1937), Penitentiary and The Lone Wolf in Paris, both 1938. While at Columbia, he also shot several two-reel comedies, including a number with The Three Stooges. In an interview with Leonard Maltin, he said he enjoyed working on them because it gave him the freedom to experiment with different lenses and filters, which likely would not have been permitted on features. Ballard filmed Let Us Live! (1939) for John Brahm and made more films with him including Wild Geese Calling (1941) and The Lodger (1944). On the set of The Lodger, Ballard met and then married actress Merle Oberon; they remained married from 1945 until 1949. He photographed 4 more of her films - This Love of Ours (1945), Temptation (1946), Night Song (1948), Berlin Express (1948). After she was involved in a near fatal car crash in London, he invented a light which was mounted by the side of the camera, to provide direct light onto a subject's face, with the aim of reducing the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles. Named the \\"Obie\\", the device benefited Oberon, who had sustained facial scarring in the car accident. The Obie became widely used in the film industry. In 1941's Howard Hughes film The Outlaw, Hughes cast Jane Russell in the lead and had numerous shots of her cleavage, which got the attention of the Hollywood censors. The film was shot in 1940 and 1941 but took five years to be released to selected theaters. Ballard was the camera man for the screen tests, did some of the second unit work for director Howard Hawks, and assisted cinematographer Gregg Toland on the first unit crew. He also filmed Laura (1944) for Rouben Mamoulian until Otto Preminger took over as director. On Morocco, Ballard had also worked with assistant director Henry Hathaway. This relationship with Hathaway came back to benefit Ballard when Hathaway himself became a director. They worked together on five films, including Diplomatic Courier (1952), Prince Valiant (1954), The Sons of Katie Elder (1965), Nevada Smith (1966), and True Grit (1969). The last, because of the natural beauty of southwestern Colorado, garnered Ballard acclaim among his peers. He also worked on a segment of O. Henry's Full House (1952) with him. After working with Budd Boetticher on The Magnificent Matador (1955), they worked together on six feature films, including The Killer Is Loose (1956), Buchanan Rides Alone (1958),The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond (1960), A Time for Dying (1969) and Arruza (1971) as well as the television show Maverick (1957) and the documentary My Kingdom For... (1985). He made The House on Telegraph Hill (1951) and The Desert Rats (1953) for Robert Wise; Return of the Texan (1952) and Susan Slade (1961) with Delmer Daves; three films with Raoul Walsh including The King and Four Queens (1956) and Band of Angels (1957); and three films with Roy Ward Baker, including Inferno (1953), often considered the best shot color 3D film of the era. He also worked with Stanley Kubrick on The Killing (1956). Ballard was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography for The Caretakers (1963). Another relationship of importance was with Sam Peckinpah. They worked together on The Westerner (1960 television series), Ride the High Country (1962), The Wild Bunch (1969), The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970), The Getaway (1972), and Junior Bonner (1972). He won the National Society of Film Critics award for Best Cinematography for The Wild Bunch. He also formed a partnerhsip with Tom Gries making five films, including Will Penny (1968) and Breakheart Pass (1976). His last feature film was Joan Rivers' Rabbit Test (1978) starring Billy Crystal in his film debut. Ballard died at the age of 80 in 1988, two days after being involved in a car accident near his home in Indian Wells, California. Personal life Ballard had been married before Oberon and was married for a third time in the 1950s to Inez, who was killed in an automobile accident in 1982. He had two sons, Christopher and Anthony.

Roma and Arn Anderson would hold the WCW World Tag Team Championship for a little over a month before losing the championship to The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobbs and Jerry Sags). After the 1993 pay-per-view Battlebowl, the Horsemen Roma and Anderson faced the semi-regular team of Paul Orndorff and \\"Stunning\\" Steve Austin on Saturday Night. During the match, Roma acted very indifferent to his tag team partner. Next, Roma teamed with Erik Watts to take on the team of Orndorff and Lord Steven Regal, but this time Roma took it a step further and attacked Erik Watts before announcing that he was now teaming with Orndorff. = Pretty Wonderful = Under the tutelage of manager Masked Assassin, the team quickly began to work well together in a feud with Marcus Alexander Bagwell and 2 Cold Scorpio. After a few months as a team, they targeted the then WCW World Tag Team Champions, Cactus Jack and Kevin Sullivan. The champions had one last defense against former champions The Nasty Boys that also saw Kevin's injured brother Dave. The match degraded into a brawl that saw Pretty Wonderful interfere, using Dave's crutch to attack the champions. Before leaving the ring, they also took a couple of shots at The Nasty Boys for good measure. Going into Bash at the Beach, Pretty Wonderful had the advantage as both champions were suffering from injuries inflicted by the challengers on previous occasions, which would lead Roma and Orndorff to win the championship. After successfully defending the championship against The Nasty Boys, Pretty Wonderful was challenged by the duo of Stars and Stripes (Marcus Alexander Bagwell and The Patriot) at Fall Brawl, where Pretty Wonderful retained the WCW World Tag Team Championship, only to lose it a week later to Stars and Stripes in a rematch. Pretty Wonderful was granted a rematch against the new champions with a match booked for Halloween Havoc, where Pretty Wonderful regained the championship when Roma used one of the title belts to knock Bagwell out cold. At Clash of the Champions XXIX, Stars and Stripes were granted one final shot at the WCW World Tag Team Championship, but the challengers also had to put up the Patriot's mask on the line, as if they lost he would unmask. After a controversial double pin, Stars and Stripes were declared the winners, and thus put an end to Pretty Wonderful's second and final run with the championship. = Aftermath = After their last title loss, Roma and Orndorff went their separate ways with Roma being used as \\"enhancement talent\\" to help build young stars. Roma would be fired less than three months later, due to kicking out from a pin attempt early in a match, where he lost to Alex Wright at SuperBrawl V. Orndorff remained with the company until an injury cut his in ring career short at the end of 2000.

History Stars and Stripes was formed in WCW in the summer of 1994 when The Patriot and Marcus Bagwell formed a face (fan favorite) tag team. Bagwell, who had previously held the WCW World Tag Team Championship while teaming with 2 Cold Scorpio, got wrestling gear to match The Patriot's patriotic look. Stars and Stripes teamed for the first time on May 28 episode of Saturday Night, defeating Dick Slater and Chris Sullivan in a tag team match. Shortly after the pair began teaming, Pretty Wonderful (Paul Roma and Paul Orndorff) won the WCW World Tag Team Championship. Bagwell and The Patriot faced the new champions in a series of non-title matches on house shows. They defeated Roma and Orndorff in the majority of the matches, but they were unable to win the title belts during a match between the teams at Fall Brawl on September 18. They faced each other one week later on the September 25 episode of Saturday Night, and Stars and Stripes won the match and the championship. Bagwell and The Patriot defended the title in a series of rematches over the next month, but they dropped the belts back to Pretty Wonderful at Halloween Havoc 1994 on October 23. The feud continued between the teams, and Stars and Stripes regained the championship on November 16 at Clash of the Champions XXIX. Had Roma and Orndorff won the match, The Patriot would have been forced to remove his mask. The team defended the belts against a series of challenger but lost them in a match with Harlem Heat on December 8 during a taping of WCW Saturday Night. They were unable to regain them in subsequent rematches; the match was not aired for several weeks, however, so Stars and Stripes continued to be billed as champions at events until the match was shown on television. Bagwell and The Patriot resumed their rivalry with Pretty Wonderful and were given a title match against Harlem Heat at Clash of the Champions XXX, but the champions retained the belts. In February 1995, Stars and Stripes began a series of matches with The Blue Bloods (Lord Steven Regal and Earl Robert Eaton). They also wrestled Romeo Valentino and Dino Casanova at SuperBrawl V in a dark match and defeated them in one minute and ten seconds. After the match, Bagwell and The Patriot were attacked by Big Van Vader. The team continued to face Harlem Heat and The Blue Bloods (with Steve Austin substituting for Bobby Eaton).

Kennedy assassination in 1963. In the novel, a fictitious charismatic character, John Thatch, an engineer, is seeking nomination for the Republican Party candidate at 1964 presidential elections. He is described as being contaminated with the \\"political virus\\". A handful of political professionals are promoting his nomination, in confrontation with the Party establishment. There exist apparent parallels between Thatch and Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., a write-in hero at New Hampshire primary. The novel criticizes the socio-political effects on society at large from the use of computers to run massive simulations, which predict the public reaction to certain (proposed) political moves before implementing them. Such simulations make it easy to manipulate the public consciousness. The \\"480\\" in the title denotes the number of groups (by party affiliation, socioeconomic status, location, origin, etc.) that the computer simulation uses to classify the American electorate. The full list of these is reproduced in the Appendix, claimed by the author to be the true list used by the Simulmatics Corporation (real name) in Senator John F. Kennedy's Presidential campaign in 1960. The cover features an IBM 5081 punched card. The Simulmatics Corporation was created by MIT Professor Ithiel de Sola Pool, who provided a non-fiction backup to \\"The 480\\" in \\"Candidates, Issues, and Strategies: A Computer Simulation of the 1960 Presidential Election,\\" MIT Press, 1964 (with co-authors Robert P. Abelson and Samuel L. Popkin). They built their model from 130,000 archived interviews in Gallup and Roper polls over a ten-year period. Based on its output, they advised Kennedy that he would benefit from a strong civil rights stand and that he had nothing to lose, and much to gain, by attacking religious bigotry and dealing frankly with his Catholicism. The 480 has been cited as prefiguring the effect of modern social media and data gathering on politics.

Their gimmick was of two \\"pretty boys\\" who were fond of their own bodies and popular with women.Reynolds, R.D. and Blade Braxton. The Wrestlecrap Book of Lists!. Toronto: ECW Press, 2007. (pg. 86) Riggs was Bagwell's third partner with whom he won the WCW World Tag Team Championship, the previous two being 2 Cold Scorpio and The Patriot. The American Males won the tag team title soon after they began teaming together but soon dropped the belts back to Harlem Heat, the previous champions. Bagwell and Riggs did not return to main-event status, and they eventually split up and feuded with each other. History =Background= Marcus Bagwell had competed in the tag team division in WCW since 1993, during which time he held the WCW World Tag Team Championship with two different partners. Teaming with 2 Cold Scorpio, he held the title belts for three weeks. He later won the title twice more while teaming with The Patriot, a team that was dubbed Stars and Stripes due to the patriotic theme both wrestlers were using at the time. After being left behind by both partners, he expressed a desire to form a new tag team to challenge for the title again. According to WCW's storylines, his former partners believed that he was too demanding, and he was unable to find anyone interested in teaming with him due to his reputation as being \\"difficult to work with\\". =Formation= The team was formed in August 1995 when Scott Antol signed a WCW contract and was placed with \\"tag team specialist\\" Marcus Alexander Bagwell. In the process, both men changed their ring names, Antol changing his last name to \\"Riggs\\" and Bagwell shortening his name to simply Marcus Bagwell. Once together, they both wore short shorts and leather vests (later wrestling tights and suspenders) to the ring and began clapping their hands over their head in time with their entrance music, which sang their praises between choruses of the team name being repeated over and over. They wrestled on the first episode of Nitro, defeating World Tag Team Champions Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck in a non-title match. Their first major appearance together came at the Fall Brawl pay-per-view, where they defeated The Nasty Boys in a match that aired on Main Event. Pro Wrestling Illustrated magazine stated that the team \\"work[ed] well as a unit and could soon challenge for the belts\\". Bagwell commented on the team in a scripted interview, saying that he believed that his previous tag teams had failed because they were in a rush to win the title belts and that he planned to work slowly toward a title victory with Riggs. =World Tag Team Champions= Marcus Bagwell in his post-American Males \\"Buff Bagwell\\" persona. On the episode of Nitro after Fall Brawl, Riggs and Bagwell won the World Tag Team Championship after defeating then-champions Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) in an upset win in an impromptu match. The American Males had been scheduled to face The Blue Bloods, but Harlem Heat attacked both members of the Blue Bloods prior to the match and volunteered to take their place. As champions, the pair defeated Harlem Heat and the team of Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck. However, Bagwell and Riggs lost the titles back to Harlem Heat one week later on Saturday Night. The American Males remained top challengers for the title belts for the rest of 1995 but were unable to regain the championship from Harlem Heat. By the end of 1995, The American Males were no longer being pushed by WCW; they competed at Starrcade 1995 in a dark match and defeated The Blue Bloods. Through most of 1996, they competed in the tag team division with no major storylines and never reached the same heights as when they were champions. They were able to defeat other mid-card teams like the Faces of Fear, and they competed in a dark match prior to Slamboree 1996, defeating The Shark and Maxx. They were consistently defeated by the company's top tag teams, and Pro Wrestling Illustrated noted that they were getting lost in a \\"very deep\\" tag team division that included The Road Warriors, Public Enemy, Harlem Heat, The Nasty Boys, the Blue Bloods, Lex Luger and Sting, Four Horsemen, The Steiner Brothers, and The Outsiders, among others. In October 1996, the team began showing signs of splitting, which intensified over the weeks. At World War 3 on November 24, 1996, the frustration came to a head as Bagwell attacked Riggs following both men's elimination from the three-ring battle royal that served as the main event. The next night on Nitro Eric Bischoff, representing the New World Order (nWo) stable, informed all WCW wrestlers that they would become targets of the nWo if they did not join the group within 30 days. Bagwell and Riggs walked to the ring shortly after Bischoff's statement, with Bagwell looking to join and Riggs trying to talk him out of it. Bagwell decided to join the nWo, turning on Riggs and dissolving the team in the process. In a scripted interview, Bagwell stated, \\"Who needs Riggs anymore when I have the nWo?!\\" He also later stated that the team's lack of success after their first title reign was the fault of Riggs' ineptitude, stating \\"I couldn't make up for all his weaknesses.\\" =Split= Following the breakup, the former partners feuded for a while with Bagwell getting the better of Riggs. Riggs would go on to briefly feud with Raven, later joining The Flock, while Bagwell formed Vicious and Delicious with Scott Norton before suffering a severe neck injury that kept him out of action for a while. Bagwell later returned to WCW, teaming with Shane Douglas to win another tag team championship. After losing the championship, he formed another tag team, pairing with Lex Luger to form Totally Buffed. When Riggs joined Extreme Championship Wrestling in 2000, he did a parody of the American Males gimmick by calling himself \\"The U.S. Male\\" and using their overhead clap taunt.

In some of these reports, it is claimed that Ayyavazhi is an anti-Christian religious phenomenon. The rapid growth of the London Missionary Society is heavily challenged by Ayyavazhi in Thiruvithancore, which is the most succeeded venue of LMS in India and revealed in certain reports. Reports of the London Mission Society =1838= This report says about the fast spread of Ayyavazhi then throughout the regions of Southern Kerala (then Travancore) and South Tamil Nadu (the then 'Tinnevely') as, \\"multitudes of people flocked from all parts of the provinces of Travancore and Tinnevelly.\\" One part of the report states that Ayya Vaikundar's devotees believe they were \\"cured by him of different diseases.\\" On the Ayyavazhi religion, the report says that \\"multitudes of people flocked to him from all parts of Travancore and Tinnevelly.\\" (p. 71) On the Thuvayal Thavasu, the report goes on to say: \\"About seventy families of this sect, having subsequently established a community of goods, removed under the guidance of a man of some influence to a part of the sea-shore in Tinnevelly, where they erected huts, performed frequent ablutions, and often assembled to hear the dreams and vision of their leader and to witness the miracles he was said to perform.\\" (p. 71) Apart from this, it mentions the practice of vegetarianism in Ayyavazhi, saying that \\"[they] abstained from all kinds of animal food, and observed the most simple and abstentious habits\\".(p. 71) This report is also a witness from any external source to show the interference of Travancore King into Ayyavazhi. This report says that, \\"The Government, however, interfered, and the excitement quickly died away.\\" (p. 71) The same report Call Vaikundar as a person of \\"deranged mind\\". (p. 71) This report also calls Ayyavazhi as a \\"new and singular sect\\". (p. 71) =1843= In one part of these report, the missionaries view \\"Ayyavazhi\\" as an anti-Christian religious phenomenon, using such phrases as an \\"agent of Satan\\" (pp. 78‚Äì79) when referring to \\"Ayya Vaikundar\\", and further reported that large \\"numbers of the low classes have joined him (Vaikundar).\\" The same report notes the \\"rapid and extraordinary career\\" of Vaikundacami (Vaikundar) (p. 75), mentioning that his religious phenomenon had \\"spread to an astonishing degree, showing by its progress.\\" (p. 75) The report also says that, \\"he is enabled to perform the cure of all diseases, and to confer innumerable blessings on his followers.\\" (p. 75) It also says that such a fast spread of Ayyavazhi created an excitement in the country as \\"so much excitement\\" and also that the majority was from low class of the society as, \\"numbers of the low classes have joined him\\". (p. 75) In another part of the report, it mentions that Vaikundacami \\"asserts that one of the principle Hindu deities has taken up his abode within him,\\" and that because of this, \\"he is enabled to perform the cure of all diseases, and to confer innumerable blessings on his followers.\\" (p. 75) The same report call the activities of Vaikundar as \\"amid these indications of advancement and the triumph (of LMS mission), it is painful to find that the agents of the prince of this world have been busily engaged in their malignant attempts to frustrate, if possible, the work of God. A negative religious imposter, named Moottecoothee, having gathered numerous disciples around him from among the heathen, has also succeeded in gaining over to his impious cause, several who had a profession of Christianity and stood in visible connection with the followers of the redeemer\\" (p. 78-79) =1847= This report provides information that around 10,000 people had joined the practice of Christianity, principally of the \\"Shanar tribe,\\" an area near PatnamPattanam/Patnam/Pattinam means port city. (Thengapattanam), and that, \\"an equal, if not greater, number had taken to Ayyavazhi.\\" (p. 88-89) Another report speaks of Vaikundar, treating diseases with only earth and water, stating: \\"They take no medicine; but rub ashes on the forehead and drink cold water (patham) as the cure for all diseases.\\" (p. 88-89) It also says that the followers of Ayyavazhi \\"have instituted a new mode of worship\\" in the place of the \\"pagan rites.\\" This report also says that, \\"they have instituted a new mode of worship, in which no images are introduced... They ... inveigh zealously against idols and demons, and profess only to worship an incarnation of Veeshnoo.\\" (P. 88-89) This report also form one among the external evidences to the fact that Vaikundar is believed as an incarnation of God even as early in the time of Vaikundar. =1858= Again, as in the 1838 report, this report mentions the practice of vegetarianism in a disciple of Vaikundacami who, \\"abstained from flesh and ate only vegetables.\\" And it refers to an active female follower of Ayyavazhi who \\"abstained from fish on Tuesdays and Fridays.\\" =1872= In this report, Vaikundar had been viewed as a \\"False Prophet\\". This report also call Swamithope as, \\"head-quarters of Mutthukuttiism.\\" (P. 107) = 1892 = In this report, reference is made to those engaged in the practice of Thuvayal Thavasu. Specifically, a comparison appears to be made in the report that the devotees of Ayya Vaikundar, especially the Thuvayal Thavasu participants, keep their bodies and their houses cleaner than the other people of chanar tribe. Reports of the Nagercoil Mission District = 1864 = This report speaks of it as \\"a modern sect, greatly on the increase\\", says that, \\"day after day, numbers flocked to him (Vaikundar)\\" (Patrick p. 4, quoting Frederick Wilkinson, ARTDC 1864). In this report a missionary Frederick Wilkinson opinioned negatively about Vaikundar as, \\"While young Muthukutti was a cowherd and afterwards became a palmyra-climber from the circumstance of his having a long and entangled plait of hair on his head he imagined he was specially favoured by the deity and got many to believe that he was the incarnation of Vishnu. Day after day numbers flocked to him.\\" (P. 4) This report says the special worship on Ayyavazhi centers as, \\"He ordered his followers to worship him especially on Sundays.\\" (P. 4) This report also says about the then construction of Swamithope Pathi as, \\"after his death they erected a tomb over his grave and a substantial building on the site in which they worship him.\\" (P. 4) The same report says that, \\"they (followers of Ayyavazhi) say that Muthukutti will come again, raise his followers from the dead.\\" (P. 4) = 1866 = This is also a part which tells about the spread of Ayyavazhi. It says that \\"he (Vaikundar) drew after him a great many people\\" (Patrick p. 15, quoting Goodeve Mabbs from ARTDC 1866). This report witness the monthly and yearly festivals in Swamithope Pathi as, \\"... built him a tomb, and hold monthly and yearly festivals in his honour.\\" (P. 15) This report also says that, \\"Many of the heathen now worship a new deity of the name Muttukutti.\\"(P. 15). = 1874 = This report reads as, \\"It was in the village comprising this (Thamaraikulam) section that the gospel gained its earliest conquests in South Taravancore. Progress was rapid. Congregation were formed and adherents come over in great numbers. In 1821 there were upwards of 1200 converts in these place. It seemed as if the whole population would soon be brought under the influence of the cross. But a terrible check was given to our operations by the rise of Muthukuttyism. ... shrines rose, rites and ceremonies are initiated, temples were dedicated and lastly a car festival was instituted at Kottayady to which thousands are annually drawn from the towns and villages far and near. This cunning contrivance of Satan has much impeded our progress in these parts and s still a great power of darkness against which we have to wage unceasing war. Our weapon are mighty through God, to the pulling down of strongholds. We have truth on our side against which neither Muthukuttyism nor any other gate to hell shall prevail. All we need is more life in these churches...\\" Reports of Kottaram Mission District = 1871 = This report records the anguish of Mr Nathaneil, an evangelist of Jamestown, who 'deplored' the increase of the followers of Ayyavazhi in \\"several places around him.\\" (Patrick p. 7, quoting S. Jones, ARTDC 1871). Reports of the Santhapooram District = 1858 = This report also views Ayyavazhi as an anti-Christian religion, speaking about a female shaman of Ayyavazhi, \\"a widow living at this place who was a follower of Muthukutti. She was also a fortune- teller and pretended to cure diseases by incantations. She allowed her hair to grow matted like that of Pantaram, abstained from fish on Tuesdays and Fridays, performed her ablutions in the sea, sang for four or five hours together in honour of her swami and was occasionally under the influence of the devil.\\" (Patrick p. 4-5, quoting Ebenezer Lewis, ARTDC 1858). In this same report Ebenezer Lewis (a missionary) says about the way of worship if people in Ayyavazhi centers as, \\"they sing and dance in honour of their Swami.\\" = 1859 = In this report Ebenezer Lewis (a missionary), calls Vaikundar as an \\"imposter\\". (P. 15) This report presents the reply of an Ayyavazhi follower to a Christian Mossionary as, \\"We worship the true God, what business have you here? We need not your instructions, begone... Narayanan (Vaikuntacami) is the true God; it is he who created us... All who deny the divinity of Narayanana are fools and mad men, for no man of sense will do it.\\" It also says that, \\"thousands continue to worship him still, believing that before long he will rise from the dead.\\" (P. 15-16) = 1863 = This report says a public proclamation of a mendicant devotee of Ayyavazhi as, \\"at this time he was telling the people that the Swami Vaigundar is expected soon, that he has sent messages to his devotees upon the people and render the country prosperous.\\" (P. 5) = 1864 = It says that, \\"Some years ago a Palmara clmber named Muthukutty claimed to be the incarnation of Vishnu and deceived many people. His followers had erected pagodas in many places. As they regard Muthukutty as incarnation of Vishnu, they affirm that the worship of Muthukutty is really a worship of the supreme being ........ This imposter is one of the chief obstacles to the spread of the gospel in these parts.\\" (Page. 6-7) Reports of the Jamestown Mission District = 1863 = This report (says about the way of worship as, \\"the followers meet together in a building something smaller than... village Chapels\\" and \\"dancing and plenty of noise make up the greater part of the worship.\\" (P. 4) Reports of the Tittuvilai Mission District = 1869 = This report says that, the people seem to have considered 'Vaikuntacami' (Vaikundar) as, \\"the last avatar of Vishnu.\\" (P. 8) See also *List of Ayyavazhi-related articles *Travancore *London Missionary Society References Further reading *ARTRC.

Early life The Santerre family moved from Saint-Michel-en-Thi√©rache to Paris in 1747 where they purchased a brewery known as the Brasserie de la Magdeleine. Antoine Santerre married his third cousin Marie Claire Santerre, daughter of a wealthy bourgeois brewer, Jean Fran√ßois Santerre, from the Cambrai in March 1748. The couple had six children, Antoine Joseph being the 3rd. The others were Marguerite, born in 1750; Jean Baptiste, born in 1751; Armand Th√©odore, born in 1753; followed by Fran√ßois and Claire. The future general's father died in 1770, his mother just months later. His elder brother and sister, Marguerite and Jean Baptiste took charge of the household and family business, helping their mother raise the younger children, they never married. Armand Th√©odore went into the sugar business, and owned a factory in Essonnes, the other members of the family remained in the brewery business. Fran√ßois, known as Fran√ßois Santerre de la Fontinelle, had breweries in S√®vres, Chaville and Paris and Claire, the youngest, married a lawyer. Antoine Joseph was sent to school at the coll√®ges des Grassins, followed by history and physics under M.M. Brisson and the abbot Nollet. His interest in physics led advances in beer production that pushed breweries out of their infancy. In 1770 Antoine Joseph was emancipated, and 2 years later, with his inheritance he purchased with his brother Fran√ßois Mr. Acloque's brewery at 232 Faubourg St. Antoine for 65,000 French Francs. In that same year he married his childhood sweetheart, the daughter of his neighbour, Monsieur Francois, another wealthy brewer. Antoine Joseph was 20 years old and Marie Fran√ßois was sixteen. Marie died the following year from an infection derived from a fall during her 7th month of pregnancy. Years later Antoine Joseph married Marie Ad√®la√Øde Deleinte with whom he had three children, Augustin, Alexandre and Theodore. Military life His generosity won great popularity in the Faubourg St. Antoine. When the French Revolution erupted in 1789, he participated in the storming of the Bastille and was given command of a battalion of the Parisian National Guard. After the Champ de Mars Massacre on 17 July 1791, a warrant was issued for his arrest and Santerre went into hiding. He emerged again the following year to lead the people of the Faubourg St. Antoine, the eastern units, in the assault on the Tuileries Palace by the Paris mob, which overwhelmed and massacred the Swiss Guard as the royal family fled through the gardens and took refuge with the Legislative Assembly. Louis XVI was officially removed as king soon after. Santerre was appointed by the National Convention to serve as the jailer of the former king. He notified Louis that the motion had passed for his execution, and the next day, at eight o'clock on a 21 January morning, Santerre arrived at the convicted man's room and said, \\"Monsieur, it's time to go\\". He escorted Louis XVI through the some eighty thousand armed men and countless citizens down the streets of Paris to the guillotine. There are differing accounts of his conduct at the execution itself. According to some, he ordered a drum roll halfway through the king's speech in order to drown out his voice. Others say that it was actually General J.F. Berruyer ‚Äì the man in command of the execution ‚Äì who ordered the drum roll, and that Santerre only relayed the order. Santerre's family maintained, however, that he actually silenced the drums so that Louis could speak to the people. Santerre was promoted to General of a division of the Parisian National Guard in July 1793. When the revolts broke out in the Vend√©e, Santerre took command of a force sent in to put a stop to the rebellions. He was not as successful as a military commander in the field; his first military operation saw the defeat of the Republican forces at Saumur. After the battle, reports circulated that Santerre himself had been killed; the Royalists even composed a humorous epitaph about his death. Nor was Santerre popular among the sans-culottes he commanded. Wounded soldiers returning to Paris reported that he was living in Oriental luxury and complained that their defeat was due either to his treason or his incompetence. Some demanded that he be relieved of his command or even sent to the guillotine. On the other hand, Santerre was not in supreme command, and not considered responsible for the outcome of the war. In October, Santerre returned to Paris, where his popularity in the Faubourg St. Antoine was undiminished. Nevertheless, his report on this expedition, in which he drew attention to the plight of the Republican army in the Vend√©e, aroused suspicion. Accused of being a Royalist due to his lack of glory during the battles in the Vend√©e, he was arrested in April 1794 and was imprisoned until the fall of Robespierre. Upon his release, he resigned his command and attempted to return to business, but his brewery was ruined. He died in poverty in Paris on 6 February 1809.

He was Italy's foreign minister from 1903 until 1909, except for a five-month period. He also was interim prime minister for about two weeks in March 1905. Tommaso Tittoni, Incarichi di governo, Parlamento italiano (Accessed May 8, 2016) Early life Tommaso Tittoni was born in Rome. His father, Vincenzo, a tenant farmer on a large scale at La Manziana, had taken part in the defence of the Roman Republic under Giuseppe Garibaldi in 1849, was exiled by Pius IX, and re-entered Rome in 1870 through the breach of Porta Pia. Tittoni was educated first at Naples, and subsequently at Oxford and Li√®ge. Tittoni became an alderman of Rome, before becoming a deputy in the Chamber of Deputies for Civitavecchia in 1886, aligning himself with the right wing. He resigned his seat in 1897, having been appointed prefect of Perugia. Three years later he went to Naples in a similar capacity, and in 1902 he entered the Senate.Tittoni Dies at 75; Italian Statesman, The New York Times, February 8, 1931 Tittoni, Tommaso, Francesco Tommasini, Treccani Enciclopedia Italiana (1937) Foreign minister and prime minister When Giovanni Giolitti became premier for the second time in 1903, Tittoni became his foreign minister. He aimed at improving relations with Austria, and also tried to bring about a reconciliation with France. It was under his auspices that French President √âmile Loubet visited Rome. On the resignation of Giolitti in March 1905, Tittoni became interim premier for a few days and remained in Alessandro Fortis's cabinet as foreign minister. His proposal to reduce the duty on Spanish wines in connection with an Italo- Spanish commercial treaty aroused a storm of indignation among the agricultural classes and caused the fall of the cabinet on 24 December 1905, and although Fortis composed a new administration, Tittoni did not enter it. Foreign policy A few months later he was appointed ambassador in London (March 1906), but in May, on the fall of Sidney Sonnino's ministry and the return of Giolitti to power, he was again summoned to the Consulta (the Foreign Ministry). He continued the policy of improving relations with Austria-Hungary, which did not contribute to his popularity. After the Bosnian crisis and the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary, his imprudently worded speech at Carate created the illusion that Italy was to be compensated, perhaps by the cession of the Trentino, and the disappointment when nothing of the kind materialized greatly weakened his prestige. He remained in office until the fall of Giolitti in December 1909. As foreign minister, Tittoni prudently advanced Italian claims on Tripolitania, at the time part of the Ottoman Empire, without resorting to outright threats of annexation.Childs, Italo-Turkish Diplomacy and the War Over Libya, 1911‚Äì1912, pp. 8-9 The Tittoni family had interests in the area. In 1907, the Banco di Roma founded a branch in Tripoli and built significant interests in banking, shipping and agriculture. The bank's vice-president was Romolo Tittoni, the brother of Tommaso Tittoni. The bank also financed the important newspaper Corriere d'Italia, which campaigned for the Italo-Turkish War in 1911.Clark, Modern Italy: 1871 to the present, pp. 184-85Sarti, Italy: a reference guide from the Renaissance to the present, p. 136 On 24 October 1909, Tittoni and the Russian diplomat Aleksandr Izvolsky exchanged diplomatic notes on an informal agreement, known as the Racconigi Bargain, for Russia and Italy to support each other's interests in the Balkans and in the Ottoman Empire, at the Italian city of Racconigi, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia was hosted by King Victor Emmanuel III.Childs, Italo-Turkish Diplomacy and the War Over Libya, 1911‚Äì1912, pp. 8-11 Italy and the Russian Empire concluded another agreement with Austro-Hungarian Empire a few days later disregarding this agreement. In April 1910, he was appointed ambassador in Paris. Titt√≥ni, Tommaso, Treccani enciclopedie on line (Accessed May 8, 2016) World War I and Paris Peace Conference Tittoni and Prime Minister Antonio Salandra at a conference of the Allied Powers on 27‚Äì28 March 1916 in Paris When World War I broke out, in spite of his Triplicist policy (supporting the Triple Alliance, the Triplice, of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy) he openly expressed himself in favour of Italian neutrality, and on Italy's entry into the war he was careful not to compromise himself with Giolitti's attitude. But he was not at his ease in the French capital, and in November 1916 he resigned from the Paris embassy. On the fall of the Orlando Cabinet in June 1919, the new Premier, Francesco Saverio Nitti, chose Tittoni as foreign minister and first delegate at the Paris Peace Conference. Nitti and Tittoni played down Italy's territorial claims, which disappointed \\"interventionist\\" like Gabriele D'Annunzio.Clark, Modern Italy: 1871 to the present, p. 245 In July 1919, Tittoni and the Prime Minister of Greece, Eleftherios Venizelos, agreed on a secret non-binding agreement, known as the Venizelos‚ÄìTittoni agreement about the conflicting territorial claims of the two countries. Greece pledged to support the Italian claims over Vlor√´ and the establishment of an Italian protectorate over Albania.Burgwyn, Italian foreign policy in the interwar period, p. 15 Greece would also secure for Italy a free zone at the port of Smyrna (under Greek administration from May 1919), while Italy pledged to support the Greek territorial claims over Northern Epirus and transfer the Dodecanese to Greece, except for the island of Rhodes, which would remain under Italian rule until such time as Cyprus would be ceded to Greece by Britain. The severe strain of the work told on his health forced Tittoni to resign in November 1919. He was chosen president of the Italian Senate in December 1919, and soon after was appointed Italian delegate on the Council and Assembly of the League of Nations, but ill-health again forced him to relinquish the latter two appointments. He remained president of the Senate until January 1929. Support of Mussolini After the March on Rome, Tittoni supported Mussolini's government and later became the first president of Royal Academy of Italy (28 October 1929 ‚Äì 16 September 1930), the most important cultural institution of the fascist dictatorship.Sarti, Italy: a reference guide from the Renaissance to the present, p. 340 On 8 April 1923, he had received the supreme honour of the knighthood of the Annunziata by King Victor Emmanuel. He died from a heart attack in Rome on 7 February 1931. References * Burgwyn, H. James (1997), Italian foreign policy in the interwar period: 1918 - 1940, Westport: Praeger, * Childs, Timothy W.

One standard work remarks that under the Ming dynasty, the elite who held privileged status through passing the Imperial exams were called shenshi Á¥≥Â£´ or jinshen Á∏âÁ¥≥. These literati, or scholar-officials, are \\"loosely known in English as the Chinese gentry\\". Through education this elite held a virtual monopoly on office holding, and overlapped with an unofficial elite of the wealthy. After the Tang dynasty, the Song Dynasty developed the civil service exam to replace the nine-rank system which favored nobles. Under the Song dynasty, their power and influence eclipsed that of the hereditary and largely military aristocrats.Brian Hook, ed., The Cambridge Encyclopedia of China (Cambridge University Press, 2nd ed. 1991), p. 200 They are also called Â£´Á¥≥ shishen \\"scholar gentry\\" or ÈÑâÁ¥≥ xiangshen \\"local gentry\\". Attempts have been made to define them as a social class who had passed the examinations and so were eligible to hold office, as well as retired mandarins or their families and descendants. Owning land was often their way of preserving wealth.Chang Chung-li [Zhongli Zhang], The Chinese Gentry: Studies on Their Role in Nineteenth-Century Chinese Society (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1955).  Caste under Confucianism  Under the Confucian class system (the four occupations) the scholar-official was at the top with farmers, artisans, and merchants below them in descending order. Since the next highest class was agricultural, scholar-officials retired to landed estates. They did not work the land themselves but hired peasants as tenant farmers. In this period of Chinese history, peasants were actually of a higher class than the merchants. The sons of these mandarins aspired to pass the imperial exams and continue the family legacy. Members of the gentry were expected to be an example to their community as Confucian gentlemen. By late imperial China, sons of merchants used their money to buy an education and enter the civil service. Also, financially desperate gentry married into merchant families which led to a breakdown of the old class structure. With the abolition of the exam system and the overthrow of the Qing dynasty came the end of the scholar-official as a legal group.  Mass killings of landlords under Mao  After the New Culture Movement, radicals used the term to criticize land owners as \\"feudal\\". Mao Zedong led the way in attacking \\"bad gentry and local bullies\\" for demanding and collecting high rent from their tenants during the republican period, and indeed many local landlords organized violent gangs to enforce their rule. The communists were able to rally much of the village population through their promises of agrarian reform and land redistribution. After the People's Republic of China was established, many landlords were executed by class struggle trials and the class as a whole was abolished. Former members were stigmatized and faced persecution which reached its heights during the Cultural Revolution. This persecution ended with the advent of Chinese economic reform under Deng Xiaoping.

It is also used by people living in the surrounding areas of Bowdon and Hale Barns. The station is located on Ashley Road. It is on the Mid-Cheshire Line, from Chester to Manchester Piccadilly, 8 miles south west of Manchester Piccadilly. History The station was opened as Peel Causeway by the Cheshire Midland Railway (CMR) on 12 May 1862 when the railway opened from Altrincham to Knutsford. The CMR was amalgamated into the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) on 15 August 1867. The station became Peel Causeway for Hale on 1 January 1899, and on 1 January 1902 it was renamed Hale. The station was served by passenger trains from Manchester Central to Northwich and Chester Northgate. The CLC remained an independent entity, as a joint London, Midland and Scottish Railway and London and North Eastern Railway operation after the Grouping of 1923, until the creation of British Railways (BR). The station then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation on 1 January 1948. When Sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Regional Railways under arrangement with the Greater Manchester PTE (Now Transport for Greater Manchester) until the Privatisation of British Railways. Hale railway station in 1988 looking north from the level crossing with the signal box near left. Services Monday to Saturday there is generally an hourly service from Hale via Stockport to Manchester Piccadilly eastbound (although some morning peak trains terminate at Stockport), and to westbound. There is an additional hourly service in peak hours only (in peak direction only). All services are operated by Northern Trains, who operate Class 142, Class 150 and Class 156 trains on the route. The current ageing rolling stock is expected to be modernised following the removal of all Pacer trains in the country by 2020. This will allow for less crowded, smoother and cleaner services for passengers using the station. Typical Monday to Saturday service pattern as of May 2018: xx:13 (platform 2) service to Chester. xx:56 (platform 1) service to Manchester Piccadilly. Sundays see a roughly two-hourly service both ways (7tpd to Chester & 8tpd to Manchester).  The Station  The station has a ticket office at Platform 1, which is open on weekday mornings. Digital station information boards are in operation on both platforms, and there are station announcements. There is a station car park on either side of the level crossing. The station has a Victorian feel to it with the station canopies and footbridge. Much of the station building on Platform 1 is now a vet surgery, and the station building on Platform 2 is now a health clinic. The signal box is not in use any more.

Early life Fedden was born in the Bristol area to fairly wealthy and influential parents. His older brother was the artist Romilly Fedden. Fedden's family was the first in the area to own a car, an interesting parallel with fellow engine designer, Harry Ricardo. This early influence almost certainly led to his future career. Fedden attended Clifton College,\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p201: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 but did not do well scholastically and was known primarily for sports. After leaving, he declined to enter the Army, and announced he would apprentice as an engineer. Apprenticeship His apprenticeship was completed in 1906, and he immediately designed a complete car.Lumsden 2003, p.91. He managed to convince the local firm of Brazil Straker to hire him, and the design was produced as the successful Shamrock. He remained at Brazil Straker over the following years, and he was particularly influential in convincing company management to take on the repair of various aircraft engines when World War I started. The company's role soon expanded to producing Rolls-Royce Hawk and Falcon engines, as well as major parts of the famous Rolls-Royce Eagle. Henry Royce offered Fedden a senior position with his company, but Fedden declined. In 1915, Fedden started the design of his own aero engine, along with his draughtsman Leonard Butler. The two were inseparable for the next twenty years, and the part number of most components of Fedden's engines were prefixed \\"FB\\" to indicate the shared credit. They designed two engines during World War I: the 14-cylinder radial Mercury, notable for the cylinders being arranged helically instead of in two rows, and the larger, more conventional single row nine- cylinder Jupiter design of about . Cosmos Engineering and the Jupiter The Bristol Jupiter, designed by Roy Fedden During this period, the aviation portions of Brazil Straker were purchased by Cosmos Engineering, where work on the designs continued. Both were ready for testing in 1918, but there seemed to be little interest at first. In September, however, a Mercury was experimentally fitted to a Bristol Scout and it dramatically improved performance, easily beating the competing Sunbeam Arab. Bristol then decided to try the Jupiter in their new Badger design, finding that it, too, completely outperformed the competing ABC Dragonfly. Production of both designs for Bristol was to start immediately but the war ended only days later and the contract was cancelled. With the ending of the war, Cosmos had no production designs and their repair work was quickly dwindling. The company was soon insolvent. Convinced of the quality of the Cosmos designs, the Air Ministry \\"made it be known\\" that they would be rather happy if the company were purchased by Bristol, which eventually took place in 1920. Sir George White later noted that they acquired the Mercury design and seven engines, all the assets of Cosmos, along with Fedden and his design team, for just ¬£15,000.Gunston 1989, p.30. Even then most sources suggest they only did so after being persuaded to do so by the Air Ministry, which is perhaps not surprising given the fragile economy of the era. Bristol soon found a role for the larger design, which entered production at Bristol's new engine plant in Filton as the Bristol Jupiter. The Jupiter became a commercial success and was widely used around the world, resulting in Fedden becoming one of the most highly paid engineers in Europe. After Jimmy Ellor's pioneering work at the RAE on turbosuperchargers, the Jupiter was experimentally adapted with a turbo to become the first \\"Orion\\" design, although this saw little use. By the late 1920s, the Jupiter design was no longer competitive and Fedden and Butler started work on a pair of new designs. Both would use a supercharger, at that time a new-fangled idea, to provide boost even at ground level and thereby deliver similar power as the Jupiter's from a much smaller engine. Re-using their earlier name, this design emerged as the Bristol Mercury, while a more powerful design at the same size as the original Jupiter became the Bristol Pegasus. Development of sleeve valve engines In 1925 and 1926, Harry Ricardo wrote a series of seminal papers at the RAE claiming that the poppet valve system was already operating at its peak capability, and that any future engines would have to use sleeve valves instead. Fedden and Butler immediately turned to such a design, adapting the Mercury to become the Bristol Aquila, and the Pegasus as the Bristol Perseus. However, both of these engines quickly found themselves at the \\"low end\\" of the power spectrum as ever-larger aircraft designs demanded ever-larger engines to power them. To solve this problem, the two designs were quickly adapted to two-row configurations, resulting in the Bristol Taurus and the superb Bristol Hercules. Not one to rest on his laurels, Fedden then started adapting the Hercules into a two-row 18-cylinder design as the Bristol Centaurus. The Taurus was in service when World War II started in 1939, but the Hercules was still in testing. Work on the Centaurus was suspended while the final problems with Hercules production were worked out. The entire Bristol sleeve-valve range would see widespread service throughout the war on a wide variety of designs. They were so successful that the Air Ministry forced a reluctant Bristol to help with the high-power Napier Sabre project that had bogged down due to problems with their sleeves. With Hercules production in full swing in 1941, Fedden returned to the Centaurus. Production was able to start in 1942, but at the time there were few aircraft that could be adapted to a 2,500 hp engine. Newer designs intended to mount engines of this size appeared near the end of the war, notably certain versions of the Hawker Tempest, taking over from the Sabre in that design. Even as the Centaurus was beginning to enter production, Fedden began considering the need for an even larger design. At the time he pitched this for very large, long-range bombers and patrol aircraft, but he stated throughout development from late 1941 that the ultimate goal was the transatlantic airline market. This led to the Orion concept, originally an enlarged Centaurus of about 4,000 hp. They also considered a four-row design with 28 cylinders, but little work on that model was carried out. For his role in creating some of the most successful aircraft engines of the era, Fedden was knighted in 1942. Later war and after The stress of wartime production needs had taken its toll on Leonard Butler, who left the company to recuperate. Although Fedden had created a long line of hugely successful engines for Bristol, he had fought constantly with management over funding priorities. Without Butler's influence it seems Fedden \\"had enough\\", and shortly after being knighted, he left Bristol to take up a variety of positions within the Government. For much of the remainder of the war, he travelled in the United States with another Bristol employee, Ian Duncan, to study US production line techniques to improve their own. In 1945 Fedden led a Ministry of Aircraft Production (MAP) mission to examine German aeronautical expertise and research. In the course of this, known as the \\"Fedden Mission\\", he visited the V-2 production centre and labour camps at Nordhausen.\\"Inquest on Chaos\\", Flight, 29 November 1945 He wrote several articles on German engine design and production concepts, and concluded generally that the German engines were lacking in supercharger design and power-per-volume compared to British types, although their fuel injection systems and single-lever controls were excellent.Roy Fedden, \\"German Piston-engine Progress\\", Flight, 6 December 1945Roy Fedden, \\"German Jet Developments\\", 13 December 1945 On his return Fedden, together with Duncan, set up Roy Fedden Ltd. in 1945. The company was provided sixty Volkswagen Type 1s by Major Ivan Hirst but was unable to sell any in the anti-German postwar climate and difficult economic conditions.Christopher, John. The Race for Hitler's X-Planes (The Mill, Gloucestershire: History Press, 2013), pp.202-3. The company's first product, the Fedden O-325, was a small horizontally-opposed fuel injected six cylinder sleeve valve aeroengine intended for helicopters or for submerged wing installation in aircraft.Christopher, p.205. It was technically superior to any flat-four or -six produced in the U.S.Christopher, p.205. and was being considered for the American Ercoupe.https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1947/1947%20-%200948.html The engine did not progress beyond development as \\"Roy Fedden Limited\\" went into liquidation in June 1947. Fedden then turned to a new turboprop design, the Cotswold, meant to be installed within the wings of aircraft in either tractor or pusher configuration,Christopher, p.205. This source may be misleading as Gunston\\"Fedden-the life of Sir Roy Fedden\\" Bill Gunston, Rolls- Royce heritage Trust, Derby 1998, , p.305 shows three different schemes, all tractor nacelle installations. The Cotswold engine did not progress beyond the design stage. Finally they decided to design their own car, powered by a three-cylinder air-cooled radial, but they found it had vibration and overheating problems and tended to skid badly when being cornered hard.Christopher, p.205. Work started on a replacement chassis, but the rest of the company's engineers lost interest and left, and soon the company had to be dissolved. After this, Fedden worked for a time consulting with George Dowty, but soon retired and spent his time teaching at the College of Aeronautics at Cranfield University. Fedden was childless. He has sometimes been mistakenly described as the father of a prominent British artist, Mary Fedden. He was her uncle. References =Notes= =Bibliography= * *Gunston,Bill. By Jupiter!

London: Pluto Press, 2001See Marx, The Poverty of Philosophy, chapter 1 part 2 where Marx refers to Proudhon's own \\"law of value\\" and chapter 3, titled \\"Application of the Law of the Proportionality of Value\\". Most generally, it refers to a regulative principle of the economic exchange of the products of human work, namely that the relative exchange-values of those products in trade, usually expressed by money-prices, are proportional to the average amounts of human labor-time which are currently socially necessary to produce them.John Eaton, Political Economy: A Marxist Textbook. Rev ed. 1963 reprinted 1970. p. 29.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I, Penguin, pp. 676‚Äì77; Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin ed., p. 522. Thus, the fluctuating exchange value of commodities (exchangeable products) is regulated by their value, where the magnitude of their value is determined by the average quantity of human labour which is currently socially necessary to produce them (see labor theory of value and value-form). In itself, this theorem is fairly simple to understand and intuitively it makes sense to many working people. However, theorizing its implications is a much more complex task as it kept Marx busy across more than two decades. When Marx talked about \\"value relationships\\" or \\"value proportions\\" (German: Wertverh√§ltnisse), he did not mean \\"the money\\" or \\"the price\\". Instead, he meant the ratio of value (or 'worth') that exist between products of human labour. These relationships can be expressed by the relative replacement costs of products as labour hours worked. The more labour it costs to make a product, the more it is worth and inversely the less labour it costs to make a product, the less it is worth. Money-prices are at best only an expression or reflection of Marx's value relationships‚Äîaccurately or very inaccurately. Products can be traded above or below their value in market trade and some prices have nothing to do with product-values at all (in Marx's sense) because they refer to tradeable objects which are not regularly produced and reproduced by human labour, or because they refer only to claims on financial assets. Theorizing the value of labour-products The \\"law of value\\" is often equated with the \\"labour theory of value\\", but this is strictly speaking an error, for five reasons.Peter C. Dooley, The Labour Theory of Value. New York: Routledge, 2005. *The law of value only states a general regulative principle about the necessary and inevitable relationship between the trading values of commodities, and the socially average labour-time required to supply them. It is simply a law governing commodity exchange. *The labour of value in economics aims to explain that determination actually works, what kinds of causal relationships are involved, how the law of value interacts with other economic laws, etc. *For Marx himself, the \\"labour theory of value\\" referred only to the theory of value upheld by some of the classical political economists from William Petty to David Ricardo, who regarded human labour as the real substance of product value. *Marx's own value theory is not a theory of value, but only of the value-system involved in commodity production and commodity trade. *Marx never referred to his own theory as a \\"labour theory of value\\";Mike Beggs, \\"Zombie Marx and Modern Economics, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Forget the Transformation Problem.\\" Journal of Australian Political Economy, issue 70, Summer 2012/13, p. 16. Gary Mongiovi, \\"Vulgar economy in Marxian garb: a critique of Temporal Single System Marxism.\\" In: Review of Radical Political Economics, Vol. 34, Issue 4, December 2002, pp. 393-416, at p. 398. his own critique of the political economists was, that they all failed to explain satisfactorily the determination of product-value by labour-time actually worked‚Äîthey assumed it, but they did not explain it consistently (see below). Thus, Marx often regarded himself as perfecting a theory which had already existed for a long time, but which had never been consistently presented before.See for example Letter of Marx to Engels, 9 August 1862. in: Marx/Engels Selected Correspondence. Moscow: Progress, 1975, p. 125. Nevertheless, in the Marxist tradition, Marx's theory of product-value is conventionally labeled \\"the labour theory of value\\"‚Äîwhile controversy persists about how much Marx's theory actually differs from that of the classical political economists.Isaak Illich Rubin, A History of Economic Thought. London: Ink Links, 1979. =Gold referent= In Das Kapital Marx normally thinks of the quantity of labour that determines product-value as the ratio between the average total amount of labour-time required to produce a reproducible good, and the corresponding average amount of labour required to produce a unit of gold (see also gold standard).Ian Steedman, \\"Marx and Ricardo\\", in: Ian Bradley and Michael Howard, Classical and Marxian Political Economy: Essays in honour of Ronald L. Meek. London: Macmillan, 1982, p. 120. Already in 1844, long before he wrote Das Kapital, Marx was very aware of credit money. Whereas \\"commodity money\\" (coinage or bullion) played an important role in the earlier stages of capitalist development, the growth of integrated capital markets meant increased use of credit money. Marx felt that the initial assumption of gold-money as a standard of value was justified, in analysing the capitalist relations of production and distribution. Thus, as follows: X quantity of product = Y quantity of average labour hours = Z quantity of gold-money Marx's idea is effectively that the value of traded products is the \\"objectified expression\\" of the current social valuation of the human labour implicated in producing them. For Marx, labour itself has no value in bourgeois society, only a price. Only the results of human work have value; the labour has to materialize itself in some kind of object which has value, and can be owned for a price or a fee. The importance of labour is its ability to preserve capital value, increase already existing value, and create wholly new value. How any individual happens to regard a particular product normally cannot change that social valuation at all; it's simply a \\"social fact\\" in the same way as \\"the state of the market\\" is a social fact, even though particular products can at any time trade at prices above or below their socially established value. Marx realized very well, that the assumption of gold-money was a simplification‚Äîthere might not be such a stable relationship between price-levels, average commodity values, and gold quantities ‚Äî but he regarded the assumption as helpful, in explaining the basic laws of motion [Bewegungsgesetze] of the capitalist mode of production \\"in its ideal average\\". =Formalization= While Marx used the concept of the law of value in his works Grundrisse, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Theories of Surplus Value and Das Kapital, he did not explicitly formalise its full meaning in a mathematical sense, and therefore how it should be exactly defined remains to some extent a controversial topic in Marxian economics. Different economists dispute how the proportionality between exchange-value and labour-time should be mathematically understood or modeled, and about the measures which are relevant.See e.g. Ian Steedman et al., The Value Controversy.

Marx's analysis of value was dialectical, in the sense that he thought value phenomena could only be understood dynamically, holistically and relationally, but he did not spell out all the conceptual, quantitative and logical implications of his position with great exactitude. The scholarly debate about those implications continues even today.See e.g. Alan Freeman & Guglielmo Carchedi, Marx and non-equilibrium economics.

Professor Ben Fine and a group of academic colleagues coordinate the conferences of the International Initiative for Promoting Political Economy (IIPPE) Basic definition of the concept =Supply and demand= Excess demand can raise the prices of products traded, and excess supply can lower them; but if supply and demand are relatively balanced, the question arises of what regulates the settled exchange-ratios (or average price-levels) of products traded in that case, and this is what the law of value is intended to explain. According to the law of value, the trading ratios of different types of products reflect a real cost structure of production, and this cost structure ultimately reduces to the socially average amounts of human labor- time required to produce different goods and services. =Cost structures and price structures= Simply put, if product A takes 100 hours of human work to produce in total, and product B takes 5 hours to produce, the normal trading- ratio of A and B will gravitate to a rate of around 1:20 (one of A is worth 20 of B), because A is worth much more than B. Moreover, if A and B are combined and used up to make product C in 40 hours, then product C is likely to be worth the equivalent of around 145 hours of human work in total, including the work of actually making product C.Luigi Pasinetti, \\"The notion of vertical integration in economic analysis\\", in L. L. Pasinetti (ed.), Essays on the theory of joint production. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1980. Pasinetti, \\"Growing subsystems, vertically hyperintegrated sectors and the labour theory of value.\\" In: Cambridge Journal of Economics, Vol. 12, No. 1,1988, pp. 125‚Äì34. For that reason, most market trade in products is regular and largely predictable as far as price levels are concerned, rather than chaotic and arbitrary. According to Marx, price movements were not simply random, arbitrary or chaotic, but governed by causal laws that limited price variability. The concept of a cost structure refers to the (direct and indirect) current labour inputs required to make a product, reflected in its price level. The concept of a price structure refers to the fact that prices rarely exist, or change, in isolation; instead, price-levels are interdependent on other price-levels, so that, if some prices would change, a lot of other prices would start to change as well‚Äîtransmitting a change in valuation across the economy. A structure exists if there is a fairly stable relationship across time between price-levels which are interdependent. Marx argues that the cost structures and price structures for products are, in general, determined by the law of value. =Terms of exchange= The law of value originates in the \\"terms of exchange\\" established for different products. If a producer has to supply too much of his own product to get a different product, this has direct consequences for the additional time he has to work to sustain himself and the trading of his product. Over time, and with more market integration, relatively stable values for products are established in accordance with production norms which exist independently of the productivity of individual producers. In that situation, each producer has to adapt his own production to those socially accepted values, the average terms of trade for products vary only within fairly narrow margins, and thus producers' activities fall under the sway of the law of value, which links \\"the economy of labour-time\\" with \\"the economy of trade\\". Paradoxically, as Marx says, the more that the producers become dependent on exchange, the more exchange appears to become independent of them.Karl Marx, Economic Manuscripts of 1857‚Äì58, in Karl Marx Frederick Engels Collected Works, Vol. 28 (New York: International Publishers, 1986), p. 834. Product-markets begin to operate according to their own laws, to which the producers can only adjust themselves. If some prices go up, many other prices will go up as well because people have to cover their increased costs. If some prices go down, many other prices will go down as well since products otherwise fail to sell when cheaper alternatives become available, but no individual is in control of these price fluctuations, or in control of how all the price changes will impact on each other. All they can really do to influence the market is to raise or lower their own prices, but even so they can do that only within certain limits. Ordinarily, people have to accept and work with many given cost-price levels and given sale-price levels which they cannot do anything about. If a product cannot be produced at a certain cost, or if it cannot be sold at a certain price-level, it is unlikely that it will be available much at all. In this way, Marx argues, production activities actually become dominated by the values of the products being produced and exchanged (so-called \\"market forces\\"), often quite irrespective of what human needs might be, because these product-values will determine whether and how it is \\"economic\\" or \\"uneconomic\\" to produce and trade particular products. =Field of application= According to Marx, \\"economic value\\" is a purely social category. It is only and exclusively a characteristic of things which are really produced and reproduced by human labour. Thus, things have an \\"economic value\\" simply and only because it takes human labour-time to make them. This value exists and persists quite independently of fluctuating prices in markets. Although they are connected, the value relationships between labour-products and price relationships can vary independently of each other, within certain limits. A price can be attached to almost any object, but this does not automatically mean that the object also has a value in Marx's sense of being the product of labour. The field of application of the law of value is limited to new output by producers of traded, reproducible labour-products,Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I, Penguin ed., p. 131. A comment by I.I. Rubin, Essays on Marx's theory of value (Montreal: Black Rose Books, 1990), chapter 15, note 15, p. 166: \\"Marx's goal was not to subsume the price of unreproducible objects under the law of value. He did not do this because of the simple reason that the law of value has to explain precisely the laws of human productive activities. In his theory of value, Marx does not treat the value of products which 'cannot be reproduced by labor, such as antiques and works of art by certain masters, etc.'\\" although it might indirectly influence trade in other goods or assets (for example, the value of a second-hand good may be related to a newly produced good of the same type). Thus, the law does not apply to all goods, services or assets in an economy, and it does not rule the whole economy. In modern Marxism, the law of value is often equated with \\"market economy\\", but that was not Marx's own idea. Rather, it limits, regulates and constrains the trade in products. Simply put, the socially necessary labour requirements set limits for the movements of product prices. Primary products are a special case, which Marx discusses in his theory of differential and absolute ground rent. World market prices for primary products can at any time be strongly influenced by the yield of harvests and mines in different countries, regardless of labour effort.Ernest Mandel, The second slump: a Marxist analysis of recession in the seventies. London: Verso, 1978. There are, besides, various kinds of products which, for one reason or another, are not subject to the law of value (see below). Origins of the concept According to Marx, the knowledge that the law of value existed, expressed in one form or another, sometimes more clearly and sometimes less, was very ancient‚Äîit reached right back to the first nomadic traders in food, crafts, services and minerals. People knew very well that there was a definite relationship between time worked and the value of products traded; in itself that was not a very difficult insight to grasp. In fact, three hundred years before the Scottish and English political economists, Ibn Khaldun had already formally presented a fairly sophisticated understanding of the law of value. The economic effects of the availability or lack of labour‚Äîalready reckoned with some precision in ancient Sumer more than four thousand years agoMichael Hudson & Cornelia Wunsch, Creating economic order. Record-keeping, standardization, and the development of accounting in the ancient Near East. Bethesda, Maryland: CDL Press, 2004, pp. 10+‚Äîwere rather self-evident in practical life. Nevertheless, different thinkers in history failed to conceptualize the law of value with any adequacy. The basic idea of the law of value was expressed by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations.\\"Labour alone, therefore, never varying in its own value, is alone the ultimate and real standard by which the value of all commodities can at all times and places be estimated and compared‚Äô ‚Äì Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1974, p. 136.Utz-Peter Reich, National Accounts and Economic Value: A Study in Concepts. London: Palgrave/Macmillan, 2001, p. 1. Neoclassical economist Paul A. Samuelson (1971) famously argued that \\"the beaver-deer exchange ratio can range anywhere from 4/3 to 2/1 depending upon whether tastes are strong for deer or for beaver\\" and, therefore, it seems that trading ratios are regulated only by the volume and intensity of consumer demand, as expressed by consumer preferences, rather than by labour-time.Paul A. Samuelson, 'Understanding the Marxian notion of exploitation: a summary of the so-called transformation problem between Marxian values and competitive prices', Journal of Economic Literature, 9, 1971: 399‚Äì431. According to the classical economists, however, such shifts in trading ratios would quickly cause a switch from beaver-hunting to deer-hunting or vice versa; short-term fluctuations in demand could not usually change the labour-costs of hunting as such, except if new technologies suddenly made it possible to capture more game in less labour-time, or if the herds of animals had become seriously depleted.Ronald L. Meek, Studies in the Labour Theory of Value. Monthly Review Press, 2nd ed., 1976, p. 70. The concept of the law of value was also stated by David Ricardo at the very beginning of his Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, as follows: At the most basic level, this Ricardian law of value specified \\"labor-content\\" as the substance and measure of economic value, and it suggests that trade will‚Äîother things being equal‚Äîevolve towards the exchange of equivalents (insofar as all trading partners try to \\"get their money's worth\\"). At the basis of the trading process is the economising of human time, and normal trading ratios become known to, or accepted, by economic actors. This leads naturally to the idea that the law of value will \\"balance out\\" the trading process.See further Geoffrey Pilling, \\"The law of value in Ricardo and Marx\\", Economy & Society, Vol 1, issue 3, 1972, pp. 281‚Äì307. Marx, Capital, Volume I, Penguin, p. 168. The corollary is that market trade is regarded as intrinsically self-regulating through the mutual adjustments of supply and demand: market trade spontaneously tends towards an equilibrium state. Marx's real concern was to understand and analyze how the law of value determines or regulates exchange, i.e. how the balancing of the production of outputs and the demand for them could be accomplished, in a society based on a universal market such as capitalism, and how this was regulated by labour-time. Marx's theory specifically aims to grasp capital in motion, i.e. how, through the circulation and competitive dynamics of capital, changing expenditures of social labor are reconciled with (or fail to be reconciled with) changing social needs. In the third volume of Das Kapital, he aims to show how the competition for profits from production is constrained by the law of value and how this shapes the developmental pattern of capitalist production. He concludes that the law of value cannot directly regulate commodity prices in capitalist production, but only indirectly (prices of production are constrained by comparative costs in labour time). Marx praised Adam Smith for already recognizing that in the transition \\"from simple commodity exchange and its law of value to... exchange between capital and wage-labour... something new occurs, [so that] apparently (and actually, in the result) the law of value changes into its opposite.\\"Karl Marx, Theories of surplus-value, chapter 3, section 4 However, Marx noted both Adam Smith and David Ricardo were unable to explain consistently how product-values were regulated by labour-time within capitalist production. Both Smith and Ricardo deeply believed that price structures for products were determined by the law of value; but, Marx argued, neither of them could explain how that value-price relationship operated, without contradicting themselves. They could not theoretically reconcile the regulation of commodity trade by law of value, with profit- receipts in proportion to capital employed (rather than in proportion to labour-time worked).Friedrich Engels, Preface to Capital, Volume II, Penguin edition, p. 101. Smith and Ricardo mooted the concept of \\"natural prices\\" instead, to postulate a \\"natural\\" (intrinsic) self-balancing tendency of markets‚Äîat the point where demand and supply were balanced, the \\"natural\\" price (the \\"true\\" value) had been reached. The effect was that their \\"labour theory of value\\" was disconnected from their theory of capital distributions. In Marx's theory, a true supply/demand balance in the capitalist economy‚Äîwhich, if it existed at all, would occur only incidentally‚Äîwould mean that goods sold at their normal production price, but this did not automatically or necessarily mean that they sold at their value. The production prices could be persistently above or below product-values. Economic value Economic value exists necessarily, according to Marx, because human beings as social beings and moral subjects must co-operatively produce and economize their means of life to survive. Humans have to value things, and each other, in order to survive. In so doing they are subject to relations of production. They know that their products have a socially accepted value, even if no trade occurs yet. Three main kinds of relationships are involved which are objectively and empirically verifiable, and often formalised in law: *Between people (social relations). *Between people and their economic products (technical relations). *Between economic products themselves (with or without trading prices; these are technical, economic or commercial relations, or, in general, value proportions). The attribution of value to labor-products, and therefore the economising of their use, occurs within these three types of relationships interacting with each other. The value of one product then depends on the value of many other products, and, in a community of independent private producers, their economic relations are then necessarily expressed through the product-values of what they trade. This expression involves character masks. Over time, most products acquire a normal exchange-value, meaning that what a product costs relative to other products remains fairly stable. However, because these three types of relationships co- exist and interact objectively independent of individuals, it may appear that economic value is an intrinsic property of products, or alternately, that it is simply a characteristic that results from negotiations between market actors with different subjective preferences. Marx recognised that value has both objective and subjective aspects,Michael Perelman, \\"The Qualitative Side of Marx's Value Theory\\". Rethinking Marxism: A Journal of Economics, Culture & Society, Volume 6, Issue 1, 1993. but he was primarily concerned with the objectification of value through market trade, where objectified (reified) value relations rule human affairs (see value-form).Marc Linder, Reification and the consciousness of the critics of political economy. Copenhagen: Rhodos, 1975. Paradoxically, he argues, this phenomenon meant that human lives became \\"ruled and dominated\\" by the products which people themselves had produced, and more specifically by the trading values of those products. When more and more of human requirements are marketised, and a complex division of labor develops, the link between value and labor-time becomes obscured or opaque, and economic value seems to exist only as an impersonal \\"market force\\" (a given structure of priced costs and sale-values) to which all people must adjust their behaviour. Human labor becomes dominated by the economic exchange of the products of that labor, and labor itself becomes a tradeable abstract value (see Abstract labour and concrete labour). The result of the difficulties in explaining economic value and its sources is that value becomes something of a mystery, and that how the attribution of value really occurs is no longer clear. The three relationships mentioned become mixed up, and are confused with each other, in commercial and economic discourse, and it appears that things and assets acquire an independent power to create value, even although value is a human attribution. Marx refers to this as commodity fetishism or thingification (Verdinglichung or reification) which culminates in what he calls fictitious capital. Value then seems to appear spontaneously out of trading activity. He regards this perception as an inevitable effect of commercial practice, since it involves the circumstance that objects acquire a value which exists independently of the valuer, a value \\"set by the state of the market\\" which individuals normally cannot change and must adjust to. The end result is that value theory is banished from economics as a useless metaphysics, surviving only in the form of assumptions made about price behaviour. Because money-prices offer convenient quantifiable and generally applicable units of economic value, no further inquiry into value is deemed necessary.Ian Steedman thus argued value theory was unnecessary, since everything can be stated in terms of prices. See: Ian Steedman, Marx after Sraffa. London: NLB, 1977. To solve the riddle of economic value, Marx argues, we must investigate the real historical origins of the conditions which give rise to the riddle in the first place, i.e. the real economic history of trade and the way that history has been reflected in human thought. Once we do this, value is no longer defined simply an attribute of products and assets, but as a relation between objects and subjects.See Karl Marx, Theories of Surplus Value (3 Vols.) and the Grundrisse manuscript. Is it an equilibrium theory? Thomas T. Sekine has interpreted Marx's law of value as a purely theoretical principle of market equilibrium which has no application to empirical reality.See Thomas T. Sekine, \\"Marxian theory of value, what we might learn from it\\", in: Korean Journal of Political Economy, Volume 2, 2004, pp. 1‚Äì35. This raises the question of how we verify that it is a \\"law\\" at all. Paul Mattick argued that Marx offered no theory of market equilibrium, only a dynamic theory of enlarged economic reproduction. In reality, markets were rarely in equilibrium anyway (that was more a hypothesis used by economists, or a euphemism for \\"price stability\\"), and what explained the market behaviour of individuals and groups was precisely the imbalances between supply and demand propelling them into action. On this interpretation, capitalist development is always imbalanced development which, typically, the state tries to mitigate or compensate for. Under capitalist conditions, balancing output and market demand depended on capital accumulation occurring. If profits were not made, production would stop sooner or later. A capitalist economy was therefore in \\"equilibrium\\" so long as it could reproduce its social relations of production, permitting profit-making and capital accumulation to occur, but this was compatible with all sorts of market fluctuations and disequilibria. So long as workers were \\"back to work\\" each working day, maintaining the value of assets and creating new value, it was \\"business as usual\\". Only when shortages or oversupply began to threaten the existence of the relations of production themselves, and block the accumulation of capital in critical areas (for example, an economic depression, a political revolt against capitalist property or against mass unemployment), a genuine \\"disequilibrium\\" occurred; all the rest was just ordinary market fluctuations. Real social needs and their monetary expression through market demand might be two very different things. A demand might exist without any buying power, and it might be that more could technically be supplied, but isn't (see Capacity utilization). Economic equilibrium was not created by any perfect match of supply and demand, but by the social framework which permitted the balancing act to occur. The role of the political state was essential in this, to provide an enforced legal framework for fair trade, currency stability and secure property rightsGeoff Kay and James Mott, Public Order and the Law of Labour;. London: Macmillan, 1982. Marx himself regarded the idea that society was somehow balanced out by market trade as a typical figment of \\"bourgeois ideology\\" and he was a strong critic of Jean-Baptiste Say.Bernice Shoul, \\"Karl Marx and Say's Law.\\" The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 71 No. 4, 1957, pp. 611‚Äì29. In the real world, there was only a more or less haphazard adjustment of supply and demand through incessant price fluctuations. In reality, a lot of non-market activity was necessary to keep market activity going, and the role of the state was indispensable (for the security of private property, currency stability and the enforcement of trading obligations). Factors counteracting the law of value The law of value can interact with other phenomena which modify its effects. The 15 main factors counteracting the operation of the law of value, as a law governing the economic exchange of products, are the following: *The non-existence of regular trade or an established, stable market for products, so that a dominant social valuation and generally accepted trading norms do not rule the terms of trade for products; in this case, there is no consensus on what products are worth, or it is unknown, and products will trade on all kinds of different terms which could vary greatly. *Structural unequal exchange ‚Äì alternative or competing sources of supply or demand are absent or blocked, distorting trading ratios in favour of those in a stronger market (or bargaining) position. In that case, the true value or cost of products may deviate greatly from actual selling prices for a prolonged time. *Other restrictions on trade and what people may do with resources (legal, technical, protectionism etc.). *Taxation and subsidies to producers by government (subsidies less indirect taxes paid can be a significant addition to the value of gross product). *Disparities in currency exchange rates. *Monopoly pricing where firms drive up prices because they control the supply of most of the market demand (perhaps because they own brands or patents), or temporarily lower prices to increase market share. *Large-scale speculation driving up prices. *Administered prices set by a state authority or a monopolist. *The large-scale use of credit economy to acquire goods and services produced elsewhere, without corresponding increases in local production occurring. *Non-market allocation of resources, including gifts and grants. *Countertrade (forms of barter). *Accumulation of fictitious capital (bubble economies). *Dumping of surplus goods at dumping prices.See for example the Australian Brumby Anti-Dumping Review of 27 November 2012. http://antidumpingreview.gov.au/ *Wars and disasters which create abnormal scarcities and demands for goods and services. *Illegal (criminal) or \\"grey\\" transactions (including pirated and counterfeited goods). All of these phenomena occur to some degree or other in any real economy. Hence the effect of the law of value would usually be mediated by them, and would manifest itself only as a tendency, or as a law of \\"grand averages\\". Nevertheless, price-value divergences are typically quantitatively limited. Although the real cost structure of production can be distorted by all kinds of extraneous factors, the law of value places limits on the amount of the distortion. Even if goods sell at an abnormally low or high prices, that abnormality relates to a \\"normal\\" referent price, and it is precisely that price which, according to Marx, is constrained by the law of value, i.e. by the proportionalities of human labour-time reflected in the cost structure of products. In capitalism Marx argues that, as economic exchange develops and markets expand while traditional methods of production are destroyed and replaced by commercial practices, the law of value is modified in its operation. =Production prices= Thus, the capitalist mode of production is a type of economy, in which both inputs and outputs of production have become marketed goods and services (or commodities) which are bought and sold freely. Here, capitalists do not make money simply from trading or renting, but from the capitalization of production itself. Products and labour are purchased to manufacture new products which have a higher value in the market than their cost price, resulting in a profit from the added value. In such an economy, Marx argues, what directly regulates the economic exchange of new labour- products is not the law of value, but their prices of production. The theoretical problem which Marx then tries to tackle is how the movements of production prices across time are nevertheless regulated by the law of value. That was the problem which classical political economy failed to solve. The production price is the price at which output would have to sell, in order to realize the average, normal rate of profit on the capital invested in producing that output. That is largely a matter of cost-prices, profit margins and sales turnover. If we find that the distribution of sale-prices for a given type of commodity converges on a particular normal price-level, then, Marx argues, the real reason is, that only at that price-level the commodity can be supplied at an acceptable or normal profit. In pre-capitalist societies, where many inputs and outputs often weren't priced goods, but allocated \\"by right\\" or according to custom, the concept of an average production price would be rather meaningless. Large price differences existed even between towns, provinces and regions, yielding welcome profit to merchant traders. In capitalist society, differences in capital yields are constantly being leveled out by competition on a larger and larger scale, creating industry norms for normal returns on investments. The corollary in capitalist production is the increasingly free movement (or, at least, mobility) of labour and capital among branches of industry, in other words that capital and labour can be traded and shifted around fairly freely, with the aid of better transport and communication systems. In Capital, Volume I, Marx largely ignored price fluctuations for the given inputs and outputs of production. He assumed that the prices of commodities were equal to their values. There were, however, three main reasons for this simplification: *Whether or not commodities used or produced traded for a bit more, or a bit less, than their socially average value, made no substantial difference to the capitalist relationships of the production process which he sought to analyze. *Marx aimed to show, that even if all commodities traded exactly at their value (equal exchange), and regardless of short-term price fluctuations, capitalists could still make money from production, since, in the normal business situation, workers always created more value for their employers than was represented by the total wage bill. If that wasn't the case, capitalists would be defeated by market fluctuations very quickly. Economic exploitation was, therefore, not simply a matter of unfairly short-changing people in market trade, but rooted in the permanently unequal position of employers and employees in production. *Although it appears like trading relationships determine the relationships of production, Marx argues that in aggregate (in an overall sense) it is just the other way round: the relationships of the direct production process (the mode of production) determine the relationships of exchange. This justifies the initial analysis of production in abstraction from all kinds of price fluctuations. =Economic significance of price-value divergences= The fact that products can be traded above or below their value (and hence that more labour can exchange for less labour) became a fundamental theoretical problem for classical political economy. That is, the classical political economists failed theoretically to reconcile the law of value with unequal exchange (the exchange of unequal values). For Marx, the exchange of non-equivalents was not an aberration in the exchange process at all, but instead the pivot of business competition among producers in capitalist society. Price-value differences for labour-products determined how much of the new surplus value produced by enterprises, potentially contained in an output of commodities, could be realized as profit by those enterprises. Capitalist economic exchange, Marx argues (contrary to David Ricardo's theory), is not a simple exchange of equivalent values.Christian Girschner, Politische √ñkonomie und Weltmarkt; Allgemeine Weltmarktdynamik in der Marxschen Kritik der politischen √ñkonomie. Cologne: Papyrossa, 1999. It aims not to trade goods and services of equivalent value, but instead to make money from the trade (this is called capital accumulation). The aim is to buy as cheaply as possible, and sell as dear as possible, under the competitive constraint that everybody has the same objective. The effect is that the whole cost-structure of production permanently includes profit as an additional impost.Paul Bairoch, Victoires et deboires, Vol. 3, Gallimard 1997, p. 699\\\\. Gross profit in Marx's sense has three main components: the fees of corporate officers; undistributed profit used to finance investment; and profit distributed as dividends to shareholders or owners. A fraction of income from depreciation write-offs (where government incentive schemes are applicable) and net increases in the value of inventories may also be counted as part of gross profit. In an overall sense, Marx argues the substance of this impost is the unpaid surplus labour performed by the working class; part of society can live off the labour of others due to their ownership of property. In this situation, output values produced by enterprises will typically deviate from output prices realised. Market competition for a given demand will impose a ruling price-level for a type of output, but the different competing enterprises producing it will take more or less labour to produce it, depending on productivity levels and technologies they use. Consequently, output values produced by different enterprises (in terms of labour-time) and output prices realised by them will typically diverge (within certain limits): enterprises can get more or less income for the value of what they produce. That divergence becomes a critical factor in capitalist competition and the dynamics of the production system, under conditions where the average price- levels for products are beyond anyone's control. =Competition between producers= If capital accumulation becomes the dominant motive for production, then producers will do everything they can to cut costs, increase sales and increase profits. Since they mostly lack control over the ruling market prices for their inputs and outputs, they try to increase productivity by every means at their disposal and maximise surplus labour. Because the lower the unit-costs of goods produced by an enterprise, the greater the margin will be between its own cost-prices and the ruling sale prices for those goods in the market, and therefore the larger the profits that can be realised as result when goods are sold. Producers thus become very concerned with the value added in what they produce, which depends crucially on productivity. In the classical competitive situation, capitalists basically aim to employ workers to: *produce and sell a greater volume of products more quickly, *at a competitive market-price which is below the socially established normal valuation for that kind of product which applies in market- trade, *principally by means of a better labour-exploitation rate and higher productivity than their competitors, *which lowers the cost-price per unit of product in the total turnover, *yet provides a superior profit rate on capital invested, even if the selling price is below the normal valuation. Such price- cutting competition is limited in scope however, because if competitors adopt the same production methods, the productivity advantage will disappear. In addition, beyond a certain point workers will begin to resist their exploitation, and they may join trade unions. And, if market prices for products were reduced to their most competitive cost-prices only, profits would fall to zero. This leads to constant attempts worldwide to improve production techniques to cut costs, improve productivity and hold down labour- costs, but ultimately also to a decline in the labor-content of commodities. Therefore, their values will also decline over time; more and more commodities are produced, for a larger and larger market, at an increasingly cheaper cost. Marx claims that this trend happens \\"with the necessity of a natural law\\"; producers had no choice about doing what they could in the battle for productivity, if they wanted to maintain or increase sales and profits. That was, in Marx's view, the \\"revolutionary\\" aspect of capitalism.In the Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels state somewhat rhetorically: \\"The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature's forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground -- what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labor?\\" Competition among producers inexorably gives rise to market monopolies for products, which may constrain further significant advances in productivity and innovation.Josef Steindl, Maturity and Stagnation in American Capitalism. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1952. According to Marx, monopolies and competition always co-exist; monopolies in the production of goods and services are rarely permanent, and as soon as competition is blocked at one level, it reappears at another level. However, Marx never discussed all the different forms of economic competition in capitalist society. His main concern was to explain what the competition was ultimately about, and what structural factors were involved, from the point of view of the production system as a whole. The negative influence of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall on business income could, Marx argued, be overcome in the long run only by organizing production and sales on a larger and larger scale, or by technological revolutions which reduced the cost of raw materials, labour and fixed equipment. That was capitalist progress. But to be able to compete in product markets in the end requires enormous amounts of investment capital, which (1) cuts out most would-be producers and (2) lowers the profit rate on investment capital. In turn, investors will no longer commit very large amounts of capital to investment projects if they are uncertain about whether those projects will yield an adequate return in the future. The more uncertainty there is, the more difficult it is to \\"securitize\\" (insure) their longer-term investments against losses of capital. If the state will not provide financial backing, private finance must provide it, but the latter is reluctant to do so if the risks outweigh the yields. This causes a powerful development of capital markets and supporting financial services, including shadow banking (credit facilities by non-bank organizations).See: Financial Stability Board, Global Shadow Banking Monitoring Report 2012. In a developed capitalism, the development or decline of the different branches of production occurs through the continual entry and exit of capital, basically guided by profitability criteria, and within the framework of competition. Where demand and profits are high, capital moves in, and when demand and profits are low, capital moves elsewhere. Thus, supply and demand are reconciled, however imperfectly, by the incessant migrations of capital across the economy. Yet, Marx argues, this whole process is nevertheless still regulated by the law of value; ultimately, relative price movements for products are still determined by comparative expenditures of labour-time. Thus, market prices for outputs will gravitate towards prices of production which themselves are constrained by product-values expressible in quantities of labour-time. =Law of value and crises= In serious economic crises, Marx suggests, the structure of market prices is more or less suddenly readjusted to the evolving underlying structure of production values.Michael Perelman, Marx's crises theory: scarcity, labor, and finance. New York: Praeger, 1987. The economic crisis means that price and value relationships have gotten badly out of kilter, causing a breakdown of the normal trading process. According to Marx, the basic meaning of crises for capitalists was, that they could not longer invest their capital at an adequate profit income, which usually meant also that their capital lost part of its value. For workers, crises meant an increase in unemployment, and wage-cuts. Some output and assets might also be destroyed, because they could not be sold, or because they did not make money. Solving the crisis meant reorganizing production and trade, to meet the new requirements for profitable sales. Usually, crises were happening all the time somewhere in the capitalist economy, but those crises were limited to specific industries going bust ‚Äì such crises normally did not spread to the whole economy. However, at some point, the crisis of particular branches of activity could set off a chain-reaction which would spread to the whole economy. Marx himself never developed a substantive theory of capitalist crises, beyond commenting about the economic crises he was able to observe himself. His main claim was that the crises are system-immanent (due to endogenous causes), and not an accidental aberration, i.e. they are a necessary feature of capitalist development. A large Marxist literature on \\"crisis theory\\" nowadays exists, in which different authors defend various ideas about the \\"ultimate\\" causes of capitalist crises (see also crisis theory) ‚Äì basing themselves on a few scattered comments by Marx on the topic.\\"Books on the Global Financial Crisis and Capitalism\\". Modkraft.dk progressive portal. Such theories are very difficult to prove scientifically, for five reasons: *The theories are very abstract, making it difficult to test them convincingly. *Even if reliable data is available, the data can be read in different ways. *There exist a very large number of different factors which can influence business profitability, investments and market sales, while it is difficult to prove how these factors are all related, or to prove which ones are the most important ones in an overall sense (since different kinds of business operate in different circumstances). *The final causes of crises might not be exactly the same in every crisis occurring in the last two centuries, except if particular causes are accepted as the main ones \\"by definition\\". *Marx's ideas about crises were based on the kind of capitalism that existed in the mid-19th century, without it being very clear what the continuities and discontinuities are with present-day capitalism. According to a popular Marxist interpretation, crises are the necessary result of the falling profitability of production capital, which, according to Marx, was an effect of rising overall productivity (raising the organic composition of production capital and lowering the value of commodities).Rick Kuhn, Henryk Grossmann and the Recovery of Marxism. University of Illinois Press, 2007; Guglielmo Carchedi, Behind the crisis. Brill Publishers, 2010; Andrew Kliman, The failure of capitalist production: underlying causes of the great recession. London: Pluto Press, 2011. But supposing that we can prove definitely that profitability did gradually decline across (say) 25 years, it is still not proved why a serious economic crisis would occur precisely at the end of that period, rather than (say) after 5 years, or 10 years, or 15 years. That is, by demonstrating an empirical profitability trend, the main causes and effects of the trend are not yet proved. In addition, production capital is a smaller and smaller fraction of the total mass of capital accumulated, and thus, it is not proved how the reduced profitability of only a minor part of the total capital can, by itself, throw the whole of capitalist society into crisis.Anwar Shaikh, \\"Explaining the Global Economic Crisis: A Critique of Brenner\\" in Historical Materialism, No. 5, 1999, p. 104. What can be definitely proved, is that slumps have happened fairly regularly in the history of industrial capitalism from the 1820s onward, some being more severe than others. In the real economic history of capitalism, there is therefore no evidence of a spontaneous tendency toward economic equilibrium: capitalism develops spasmodically, through booms and slumps. Every crisis is supposed to be the last one, until a new crisis occurs. That was, for Marx, a good reason for doing away with the capitalist system, and bringing production under planned, collective control by the freely associated producers. Modification in the world market Marx believed that the operation of the law of value was not only modified by the capitalist mode of production, but also in the world market (world trade, as contrasted with the home market or national economy). The main reason for this was the existence of different levels of the intensity and productivity of labour in different countries, creating for example a very different cost structure in different countries for all kinds of products.The Marxist Ernest Mandel argued that even before differentials in productivity between nations became apparent through foreign trade, there already existed regional disparities within countries; these disparities tended to fade with more market integration. See: Ernest Mandel, Capitalism and Regional Disparities. Toronto: Hogtown Press pamphlet, 1971, reprinted under the same title in: Southwest Economy and Society, Vol. 1, 1976. Products that took 1 hour of labour to make in country A might take 10 hours to make in country B, a difference in production costs which could strongly influence the exchange values realised in the trade between A and B. More labour could, in effect, exchange for less labour internationally (an \\"unequal exchange\\" in value terms) for a prolonged time. In addition, the normal rate of surplus value could be different in different countries. That makes a huge difference not only to profitability, but to the ability to sell products at competitive prices. So traders would try to use this differential to their advantage, with the usual motto \\"buy cheap, sell dear\\". This promotes the internationalization of business. The result, some Marxists argue, is an international transfer of value, from countries with a weaker bargaining position to those with a stronger one.See Anwar Shaikh, \\"Values and Value transfers: A Comment on Itoh.\\" and Enrique Dussel & Anibal Yanez, \\"Marx's economic manuscripts of 1861‚Äì63 and the 'concept' of dependency\\". Latin American Perspectives, Vol. 17 No. 2, Spring 1990, pp. 62‚Äì101, as well as the literature cited in the article on unequal exchange. The differential in labour valuations becomes a source of profit (see also global labor arbitrage). Among German Marxists, Marx's fragmentary remarks on the law of value in a world market setting stimulated an important theoretical debate in the 1970s and early 1980s.See *Oliver Nachtwey and Tobias ten Brink, \\"Lost in Transition: the German World-Market Debate in the 1970s\\".

Marburg: Metropol Verlag, 1992; Wissenschaftlicher Streit um die modifizierten durchsetzungsformen des Wertgesetzes auf dem Weltmarkt One aim of this debate was to move beyond crude Ricardian interpretations of comparative advantage or comparative costs in explaining the pattern of world trade. To some extent similar debates took place in the US, France and Japan.See Anwar Shaikh's work, Samir Amin's work in France, and Makoto Itoh's Japanese work available in English. In particular, when the volume of intra-industry trade (IIT) between countries grows (i.e. the same kinds of products are both imported and exported by a country), and when different branches of the same multinational import and export between countries with their own internal price regime, international comparative advantage theories of the Ricardian type do not apply. Nowadays, Marxian scholars argue, comparative advantage survives mainly as an ideology justifying the benefits of international trade, not as an accurate description of that trade (some economists however draw subtle distinctions between comparative \\"advantages\\" and comparative \\"costs\\", while others switch to the concept of competitive advantage).Guglielmo Carchedi, For Another Europe: A Marxist Analysis of the EU. London: Verso, 2001; Branko Horvat, The theory of international trade; an alternative approach. Palgrave Macmillan, 1999; John Weeks, \\"International Exchange and the Causes of Backwardness\\", in Latin American Perspectives VI (Spring 1978) Ultimately, the \\"comparative advantage\\" ideology is based on a very simple ideology about trade. This ideology says, that if everybody specializes in what they are the best at producing, this provides the greatest amount of wealth for everybody, because then everybody will be operating in the most efficient way. But this ideology is hopelessly naive.Andre Gunder Frank, Capitalism and Underdevelopment in Latin America. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1971, pp. 183‚Äì84. The simple reason is that, even if products are produced very efficiently, this says nothing about the terms on which products will be traded, and the incomes which producers will get for their work. They might work very efficiently, but get very little money for their effort. The operation of the law of value in the world market might however seem rather abstract, in view of the phenomena of unequal exchange, differences in accounting norms, protectionism, debt-driven capital accumulation and gigantic differences in currency exchange rates between rich and poor countries. These phenomena can create very a significant distortion in world trade between final market prices for goods, and the real production costs for those goods, resulting in superprofit for the beneficiaries of the trade. The value and physical volume of manufactured exports by developing countries increased gigantically more than the actual income obtained by the producers. Third world nations relatively speaking received less and less for what they produced for sale in the world market, even as they produced more and more; this is also reflected in the international terms of trade for manufactured products. The postulate of the law of value does however lead to the Marxian historical prediction that global prices of production will be formed by world competition among producers in the long term. That is, the conditions for producing and selling products in different countries will be equalised in the long run through global market integration; this will be reflected also in International Financial Reporting Standards. Thus globalisation means that incipiently the \\"leveling out of differences in industrial rates of profit\\" through competition begins to operate internationally.Lowell Bryan, \\"Globalization's critical imbalances\\". McKinsey Quarterly, June 2010. Trading ratios and exchange-values for products sold globally would thus become more and more similar, in the long term.See Anwar Shaikh, \\"Foreign trade and the law of value.\\" In Soviet-type societies There has been a long debate among Marxists about whether the law of value also operates in non-capitalist societies where production is directed mainly by the state authorities.Catherine Samary, Plan, Market and Democracy, IIRE Notebook for study and research 7/8, 1988. This debate occurred separately from the socialist calculation debate. There is still little agreement on the issue, because different Marxists use different definitions and concepts which are often influenced by political attitudes. =Joseph Stalin= In his famous pamphlet Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR, Joseph Stalin argued that the law of value did operate in the economy of the Soviet Union.Joseph Stalin, Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR. Stalin was primarily concerned at the time with the problem of wasted labour, in an economy where workers often could not be easily fired (they had a constitutionally guaranteed right to a job, and there was considerable featherbedding of employees), and where there was often no clear relationship between salary-levels, work performance and actual output. The Stalin theory of the law of value was critically discussed by W≈Çodzimierz Brus in The market in a socialist economy.W≈Çodzimierz Brus, The market in a socialist economy. London: Routledge, 1972. =Yevgeni Preobrazhensky= Apart from Stalin, the most influential theorist of the law of value in the 20th century was Yevgeni Preobrazhensky. In his book The New Economics (1926, published in English in 1965), Preobrazhensky tried to specify clearly what the law of value should be understood to mean, for the purpose of economic policy. His main thesis was as such: This influential analysis equated the law of value with market economy, and counterposed it to state-organized economy. There was, in other words, a structural conflict between the market principle and the collective planning principle. Preobrazhensky then aimed to show how state-organized economy could prevail over market forces in such a way, that the economic growth path would be optimal. His basic idea was that a tax on the millions of farmers in the Russian empire could finance urban industrialization. Preobrazhensky's approach to the law of value became the common assumption of left-wing Marxists discussing the transition to socialism,see, e.g., Ernest Mandel, Marxist Economic Theory, Vol. 2. London: Merlin Press, 1968, chapters 15, 16 and 17; Catherine Samary, Plan, Market and Democracy, IIRE Notebook for study and research 7/8, 1988 ; Paul Sweezy, ‚ÄúToward a Program of Studies of the Transition to Socialism,‚Äù Monthly Review Vol. 23, no. 9 (February 1972): 1‚Äì13. until the theorists of market socialism began to challenge it and gained more intellectual influence. According to Fred L. Block, nowadays \\"Contemporary scholarship rejects the assumption...that state and market are distinct and opposing modes of organizing economic activity.\\"Fred Block & Peter Evans, \\"The state and the economy\\". In: Neil J. Smelser & Richard Swedberg, The handbook of economic sociology. Princeton University Press, 2005, p. 505. =State capitalism theorists= Supporters of the theory of state capitalism in the Soviet Union (such as Tony Cliff and Chris Harman) and scholars such as Andre Gunder Frank have also believed that the law of value operated in Soviet-type societies.Andre Gunder Frank, \\"In Memoriam: Tribute To Ernest Mandel\\" ; John Lister, The Fallacies of State Capitalism: Ernest Mandel and Chris Harman Debate the USSR. Socialist Outlook, 1991. However, it is not always clear what they mean by the law of value, beyond the vague idea that the direct producers remain dominated by their own products, or that labour costs remain important, or that Soviet-type societies remained influenced by the world market. In 1979, Tony Cliff explained: Many Western Marxists reasoned that if workers were oppressed in the Soviet economy, the Soviet system could not be socialist, and that if it was not socialist, it must be capitalist ‚Äì be it a special kind of capitalism, a capitalism mainly directed by the state.See Marcel van der Linden, Western Marxism and the Soviet Union.Haymarket Books, 2009. A similar theory was adopted in 1967 by the Chinese communists: after Stalin died in 1953, according to this theory, a sort of coup d'√©tat had occurred in the Kremlin, which led to the \\"restoration of capitalism\\" throughout the USSR. The 1965 Soviet economic reform was interpreted as a proof of that theory. Some Western Maoists followed this interpretation.Martin Nicolaus, Restoration of capitalism in the USSR. Chicago: Liberator Press, 1975; Marcel van der Linden,Western Marxism and the Soviet Union. A Survey of Critical Theories and Debates since 1917. Haymarket Books, 2009, chapter six. A 1977 resolution of the Bay Area Communist Union, an American Maoist group, stated that: \\"In socialist society, commodity exchange, as well as value and the law of value continue to a certain extent. Only communism obliterates all aspects of commodity exchange, value, money, etc. However, one commodity does disappear under socialism: labor-power.\\"Bay Area Communist Union, ¬¥¬¥Marxism- Leninism-Mao Tsetung Thought. Resolutions of our Fourth General Meeting (July 1977)¬¥¬¥. San Francisco, 1977. From the 1930s to the 1950s, when Soviet industrialization seemed to be forging ahead, many Western Marxists theorized that Soviet state capitalism was a \\"higher stage\\" of capitalism than ordinary capitalism. But when it became very clear, in the 1980s, that Soviet economic growth was lagging behind the West, the Soviet state-capitalist stage was often reconceptualized as a lower stage of capitalism,Marcel van der Linden,Western Marxism and the Soviet Union. A Survey of Critical Theories and Debates since 1917. Haymarket Books, 2009, chapter 7. which would in due course lead to \\"ordinary\\" capitalism (in Cliff's theory, all capitalisms in all countries are \\"state capitalisms\\" of one sort or another ‚Äì some more developed, and others less developed). In his famous book State capitalism in Russia (1948), Tony Cliff theorized that the law of value \\"tends to equalise supply and demand, a situation in which price is equal to value, or more correctly, is equal to price of production.\\" Although there seemed to him to be little internal evidence that the law of value regulated the Soviet economy, he believed the law of value was \\"the arbiter of the Russian economic structure as soon as it is seen in the concrete historical situation of today‚Äîthe anarchic world market.\\"State capitalism in Russia (1948), chapter 7 (originally published in 1955, republished by Bookmarks in 1996). Critics of this interpretation argue that the Soviet economy was, in reality, rather autarkic (self-sufficient), that foreign trade was state-directed and played a comparatively small role in the economy as a whole, and that the foreign transactions were often non-commercial (often a form of barter, subsidized transfers or counter-trade).Albert Szymanski, Is the Red Flag Flying? The Political Economy of the Soviet Union. London: Zed Press, 1979. Rudolf Hilferding regarded state capitalist theories as conceptually incoherent, because ‚Äì he argued ‚Äì the law of value presupposed market competition among private enterprises. If the allocation of resources was performed by a state dictatorship, there was no capitalism at all.Rudolf Hilferding, \\"State Capitalism or Totalitarian State Economy\\". The Modern Review, June 1947, pp. 266‚Äì71. =Ernest Mandel= According to Ernest Mandel,Mandel's ideas are discussed in: Manuel Kellner, Gegen Kapitalismus und B√ºrokratie. Zur sozialistischen Strategie bei Ernest Mandel. Cologne: Neuer ISP Verlag, 2009. the law of value, as a law of exchange, did influence non-capitalist societies to some extent, inasmuch as exchange and trade persisted, but because the state directed the bulk of economic resources, the law of value no longer ruled or dominated resource allocation.Ernest Mandel, \\"The Laws of Motion of the Soviet Economy\\". In: Review of Radical Political Economics, Vol. 13, No. 1, Spring 1981, pp. 35‚Äì39. The best proof of that was that there was mostly no clear relationship at all anymore between the exchange-value of goods traded, how they were allocated, and what it really cost to produce them; accounting information, insofar as it was valid, might in fact be unable to show anything about the real nature of resource allocation. The prices in the Soviet economy were, for the most part, not market prices but administered prices set by the planning boards (there was also a black market, mainly for consumer goods).David Remnick, \\"Soviet Union's \`Shadow Economy' ‚Äì Bribery, Barter, Black-Market Deals Are The Facts Of Life.\\" The Seattle Times, September 22, 1990. Insofar as the social priorities of state policy ensured that people got what they needed, that was a good thing; but insofar as resources were wasted because of a lack of sensible cost-economies, it was a bad thing. Cost- accounting is, of course, no more \\"neutral\\" than profit-accounting; a lot depends on what costs are included and excluded in the calculation. Mandel blamed the waste of resources in the Soviet economy on bureaucracy, and regarded the USSR as a bureaucratically degenerated workers' state. He believed that if there was genuine democracy instead of bureaucracy, there would be no more waste.Ernest Mandel, \\"Some comments on H. Ticktin's \\"Towards a political economy of the USSR\\", in: Critique (Glasgow), 1974 (3), pp. 23‚Äì26; Ernest Mandel, \\"Ten theses on the social and economic laws governing the society transitional between capitalism and socialism\\" in: Critique (Glasgow), 1974 (3) : pp. 5‚Äì21; Ernest Mandel, Power and money. A Marxist theory of bureaucracy. London: Verso, 1992. Mandel's critics believe this is a naive theory because: *It presents democracy as a solution, without considering property forms and institutional arrangements in any detail. *In the real world, there exists ‚Äì as Mandel sometimes admittedErnest Mandel, \\"Economics of the transition period\\", in: Fifty years of world revolution: an international symposium, ed. and with an introd. by Ernest Mandel. New York: Merit Publications, 1968 : pp. 275‚Äì303. ‚Äì no \\"quick-fix\\" or panacea for the problems of bureaucracy. *According to Mandel, \\"the bureaucracy\\" is a purely parasitic social caste, which has usurped the power to rule over society; it has no productive function at all, it is only \\"ballast\\" for society. Thus, if the bureaucracy is wiped out through a political revolution, the bureaucrats would not be missed and society would be better off.Ernest Mandel, \\"Why the Soviet bureaucracy is not a new ruling class\\", in: Monthly Review (New York) Vol. 31, 1979, No. 3, pp. 63‚Äì76. This interpretation is difficult to sustain in reality, since the bureaucrats performed essential managerial, organizing, development, service and coordination functions. *Democratic decisions are not necessarily any better-made or more efficient, than bureaucratic or entrepreneurial ones; at most, democracy allows for errors to be corrected more easily, and permits bad managers to be ousted more easily, instead of bad managers becoming entrenched in positions of power. *The real issue is not democracy as such, but the specifics of democratic procedures, mechanisms and organizational forms.Claus Offe, \\"Democracy in crisis: two and a half theories about the operation of democratic capitalism.\\" Open Democracy (online), 9 July 2012. *Mandel misunderstands the core idea of communism, which is to change the way human beings relate and are related, so that they can all have good lives in a cooperative commonwealth. *Economists have made many arguments along the lines that inefficiency in the Soviet economy resulted precisely from the lack of any clear relationship between pricing and economic value (in the sense of true economic cost). Charles Bettelheim complained that Mandel lacked a \\"dialectical synthesis\\", because, in a somewhat Cartesian way, Mandel tried \\"to deal with the complex reality of the transitional society by means of the simplest and most abstract categories of \\"pure\\" and fully developed socialist society.\\"Charles Bettelheim, The transition to socialist society. Hassocks, Sussex: Harvester Press, 1975, p. 150. Other critics think the problem is rather different: it is that almost all Marxists have created a theoretical dichotomy between \\"market economy\\" and \\"planned economy\\", suggesting that either there is market anarchy, or else a planned, non-market economy.Diane Elson, \\"Market socialism or socialization of the market?\\" in: New Left Review I/172, November‚ÄìDecember 1988, pp. 1‚Äì44. In the real world, such a dichotomy rarely exists‚Äîalmost all economists agree that planning and markets are compatible; in fact they usually depend on each other.Michael Hudson, \\"A planned economy for the 1%\\". Interview in The Real News, 26 February 2012. According to Peter Frase, \\"The Market has been so mystified by its apologists that we no longer recognize a planned economy when we see it.\\"Peter Frase, \\"The Market as a plan\\". Jacobin magazine (New York), 1 January 2012. =Che Guevara= In socialist Cuba, Che Guevara adopted the view that if more resources were directly allocated to satisfy human needs, instead of commercially supplied, a better life for people would result.See, for more information, Helen Yaffe, Che Guevara: The Economics of Revolution. Palgrave Macmillan, 2009. Guevara organised an interesting conference at which the theoretical issues were debated.Bertram Silverman, Man and Socialism in Cuba; The Great Debate. New York: Atheneum, 1971. At that time, Cuba benefited from plentiful subsidies by Eastern bloc countries, principally the Soviet Union, which compensated for the US trade boycott against Cuba. However, the Cuban Government defaulted on most of its international debt in 1986, reducing its access to foreign credit, and from 1989 the support of the Eastern Bloc disappeared, causing a steep decline in the Cuban national product. The Cuban economy was thereafter sustained to a large extent with foreign tourism, foreign remittances, foreign counter-trade and joint-ventures with foreign companies. In recent years, there have been a number of pro-market reforms, and attempts to reduce state-bureaucratic regulation.Marc Frank, \\"Cuba plans massive shift to \\"non-state\\" sector\\". Reuters press release, 23 April 2012. Nicholas Ward, \\"In Cuba will new rules mean new markets?\\". Financial Post (Don Mills, Ontario), 20 March 2012. The modal standard of living and quality of life in Cuba is still among the best in Central and Latin America.The United Nations Human Development Index for 2011 ranked Cuba at #51 out of 173 countries (in the top 30% of countries). This ranking was surpassed by Chile at #44, Argentina at #45, and Uruguay at #48. =New Left= Generally, the Western New Left adopted the idea that true socialism would involve the abolition of the law of value, since commodity production would be abolished ‚Äì goods and services would be allocated according to need, and primarily according to non-market principles. This recalled an idea by Nikolai Bukharin and Yevgeni Preobrazhensky in The ABC of Communism (1920): =John Weeks= John Weeks has argued that the law of value is unique to an economy based on the capitalist mode of production.John Weeks, Capital and exploitation. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1981. He rejects the claim by Engels that the law of value is associated with the entire history of economic exchange (trade), and modified when the vast majority of inputs and outputs of production have become marketed, priced commodities. Marx himself said that the law of value \\"develops fully only on the foundation of capitalist production\\", implying that the law of value already asserted itself before capitalist production, although not fully. Indeed, in a criticism of Adam Smith, Marx specifically refers to the law of value governing \\"simple commodity exchange\\"‚Äîthe point being that this law is transformed in capitalist exchange where \\"more labour is exchanged for less labour (from the labourer‚Äôs standpoint), less labour is exchanged for more labour (from the capitalist‚Äôs standpoint)\\".Karl Marx, Theories of surplus value, chapter 3, section 4.. Other Marxists (including Ernest Mandel, Michael Perelman and the Japanese scholar Kozo Uno) followed Marx and Engels in believing that the law of value emerges and develops from simple exchange based on simple commodity production.Ernest Mandel, Marxist Economic Theory. Monthly Review Press, 1969; Kozo Uno, Principles of Political Economy. Harvester Press, 1980. If the law of value was unique to capitalism, it becomes impossible to explain the development of pre-capitalist commodity exchange or the evolution of trading processes in a way consistent with historical materialism and Marx's theory of value. So a better approach, it is argued, is to regard the application of the law of value as being modified in the course of the expansion of trade and markets, including more and more of production in the circuit of capital. In that case, a specific society must be investigated to discover the regulating role that the law of value plays in economic exchange. =Heinz Dieterich's equivalence economy= In contemporary Venezuela, the German socialist economist Heinz Dieterich has argued that the production and distribution of products should occur in accordance with their true labour costs, as shown by special macro-economic labour accounts estimating how much work-time products take to make (in socialism of the 21st century this is called \\"equivalence economy\\"). The idea here is that people \\"get even\\" when they get just as much work back, as they put in themselves. However, this argument is very controversial. Its critics claim equivalence economy is practically impossible, and some indeed point to Marx's rejection in the Grundrisse of the \\"time-chit\\" theory of allocating goods proposed by 18th and 19th century utopian socialists such as John Francis Bray and John Gray.See Marx, Grundrisse, chapter 2 . In Capital, Volume I, Marx states: \\"I have elsewhere discussed exhaustively the shallow utopianism of the idea of 'labour-money' in a society founded on the production of commodities\\". (Penguin ed., p. 188). see also: Alfredo Saad-Filho, \\"Labour, money and 'labour-money: a review of Marx's critique of John Gray's monetary analysis'\\", History of political economy, Vol. 25, issue 1, 1993, pp. 65‚Äì84. On this view, Dieterich at most shows that the allocation of goods according to commercial principles is only one method of allocating resources; other methods such as sharing, redistribution, subsidization, barter, grants and direct allocation according to need may often serve the interest of fairness, efficiency and social justice better, provided that people accept a common ethic about what is best for all, if they can see that adopting such an ethic has good results. Thus, while integrated labour accounts are certainly useful to have as a planning tool, allocating resources according to the labour-time they represent is most likely not useful as a general economic principle (it could be useful in specific areas of activity). One feasible alternative to Dieterich's labour- equivalents is a new type of digital credit system, in which people gain or lose credits (and therefore gain or lose access to resources) depending on what they verifiably do, and on what age they are. This alternative has not yet been very popular among socialist theorists, because generations of socialists have been educated in the idea that socialism aims to abolish monetary instruments, and because the idea seems to many to be too close to \\"social-democratic subsidization\\" or \\"funny money\\" social credit theories. Nevertheless, monetary transactions in modern capitalism are increasingly only digital credits and debits, the technology exists to make transactions by mobile phone, and more than 90% of all money in developed capitalist countries is bank money, not cash or cash deposits.\\"Almost all of the money in a contemporary economy consists of the liabilities of financial institutions. In the eurozone, for example, currency in circulation is just 9 per cent of broad money (M3).\\" ‚Äì Martin Wolf, \\"Intolerable choices for the eurozone\\". Financial Times, 31 May 2011 (in the US, it is about 7%; in 1960 according to Federal Reserve data series, it was about 50%) =Ongoing debate= The international debate is still continuing.Jayati Ghosh, \\"The Emerging Left in the \\"Emerging\\" World\\". Ralph Miliband Lecture on the Future of the Left, London School of Economics, London, U.K., 28 May 2012. MR Zine, 26 June 2012. Among the 9 unsolved questions of Marxism which Perry Anderson named in Considerations of Western Marxism (London: New Left Books, 1976, p. 121) were \\"How can established systems of bureaucratic privilege and oppression be attacked and abolished? What would be the structure of an authentic socialist democracy?\\". Although the number of Marxist academics proliferated, none of the 9 questions was really solved. How progressive the Soviet Union really was is still being debated even today, for example by Bob Allen in his book Farm to factory.Robert C. Allen, Farm to Factory: A Reinterpretation of the Soviet Industrial Revolution. Princeton University Press, 2009. See also Wendy Carlin, Mark Schaffer & Paul Seabright, \\"Soviet power plus electrification: what is the long-run legacy of communism?\\" For some socialist economists, the socialist economy is an end in itself, for others it is only a means to an end. Some socialist theorists (such as Paul W. Cockshott) are monothetic theorists: they wish the whole of the economy to be dominated by one economic principle, such as labour-value, or a few basic economic principles. Other socialist theorists (like Alec Nove) are pluralist theorists, believing that the economy functions best if there is a variety of different systems for producing/distributing different kinds of products and services, using a variety of property forms. Historical research is being done on the commons, often inspired by Elinor Ostrom.Amy R. Poteete, Marco A. Janssen, and Elinor Ostrom, Working together; Collective action, the Commons and Multiple Methods in Practice. Princeton University Press, 2010. Tine de Moor, \\"What do we have in common? A comparative framework for old and new literature on the commons\\". International Review of Social History, Volume 57 Part 2, August 2012. This is an attempt to understand empirically how people were able to manage land use collectively for 500 years or more, without significant state support or supervision.In 2014, the Review of Radical Political Economics features a special issue on the commons. A frequent complaint in the discussion is that socialists, like their liberal and conservative counterparts, confuse an ethical principle of resource allocation (the \\"why\\") with the economic technique of resource allocation (the \\"how\\") ‚Äì the result being an economic policy in which the means and the ends are confused. In almost any society, market and non-market methods of allocating resources are in practice combined,Costas Lapavitsas, \\"Commodities and Gifts: Why Commodities Represent More than Market Relations\\". Science & Society, Vol 68, # 1, Spring 2004. which is acknowledged in official national accounts by the inclusion of market and non-market sectors. The real question for economists is how the two can be combined to achieve the best economic result for citizens, and what the effect is of market and non-market methods on each other.See e.g. the works of J√°nos Kornai. This can be a highly politicized and contentious dispute, since the chosen methods can advantage some and disadvantage others; it is very difficult to devise allocation methods which distribute the gains and losses of economic policy in an equal or equitable way among all economic actors. Typically, pro-capitalist theorists argue that \\"there is no alternative to the market\\", and the anti-capitalists argue that markets could not even exist without many non-market mechanisms and supports (i.e. marketisation merely shifts the burden of unpaid work effort onto someone else). Almost all modern economies are \\"mixed economies\\" meaning that they combine market allocation of resources with non-market allocation, in various ways. That is why the modern economic controversies are almost always about the relative importance which different kinds of allocation mechanisms should have.Carmelo Mesa-Lago, Market, socialist and mixed economies. Comparative policy and performance - Chile, Cuba and Costa Rica. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003. This debate is, of course, very strongly influenced by the income which the different economic actors can get, if particular economic policies are realized. Criticism Traditionally, criticism of Marx's law of value has been of three kinds, i.e. conceptual, logical and empirical. =Conceptual criticism= The conceptual criticism concerns the concept of value itself. For Marx, economic value in capitalist society was an objectified social characteristic of labour-products, exchanged in an economic community, given the physical reality that products took a definite amount of society's labour- time to produce, for a given demand. A product had a value, regardless of what any particular person might think about it, priced or unpriced (see value- form). Marx regarded the law of value as analogous to an objective physical law, since people could never escape from the fact that the products they consumed presupposed an objective cost in human labour time. Critics however argue that economic value is something purely subjective, i.e. a personal valuation determined by personal preferences and marginal utility; only prices are objective.Simon Clarke, Marx, Marginalism and Modern Sociology: From Adam Smith to Max Weber. Palgrave Macmillan, 1991. One of the first Marx-critics to argue this was the Austrian Eugen B√∂hm von Bawerk.Eugen von Bohm-Bawerk, Karl Marx and the close of his system, followed by Bohm Bawerk's criticism of Marx, by Rudolf Hilferding. Porcupine Press, 1984. Marx himself never denied that subjective valuations existed, but argued rather that they co-existed with objective values which were ultimately not determined by preferences but by real production costs. In the real world, many prices are not \\"objectively manifest\\" either‚Äîthey are only ideal prices used for the purpose of calculation, accounting and estimation, not actually charged or applying directly to any real transaction.\\"Every trader knows, that he is far from having turned his goods into money, when he has expressed their value in a price or in imaginary money, and that it does not require the least bit of real gold, to estimate in that metal millions of pounds' worth of goods. When, therefore, money serves as a measure of value, it is employed only as imaginary or ideal money. This circumstance has given rise to the wildest theories.\\" - Marx, Capital Vol. 1, ch 3, section 1. Yet, these notional prices can nevertheless influence economic behaviour, inasmuch as the prices estimated affect expectations of incomes and expenditures. Economists then debate about when a price can be said to be \\"objective\\". Marx argues that products have different objective costs of production, reducible to different amounts of labour-time. Against this view, one could also argue that the physical amounts of comparable resources (such as energy, land, water, etc.), necessary to manufacture a car, are much larger than resources necessary for growing a carrot, explaining why the cost (and, hence, minimal price) of a car is larger than the cost of a carrot. In other words, it is the total input costs (including costs of labour), not the amount of labour per se, which create the difference in costs (and, therefore minimal equilibrium prices) of the goods. However, Marx argues in the first chapters of Das Kapital that most of such costs (i.e. insofar as they refer to reproducible goods) are again reducible to direct and indirect costs in human labour time. When we see a car, we do not see the worldwide cooperation of labour-efforts that produced it at a certain cost,Barry Park, \\"States of origin: where cars come from\\". Drive (Sydney), 7 April 2012. yet those labour efforts, weighed against other labour efforts, determine its value. Austrian economics explicitly rejects the objectivity of the values of goods as logically and conceptually unsound. On this view, we cannot validly say that products took a certain amount of labour, energy and materials to make, and compare them on that basis. It follows that the Austrian School thinks most contemporary economic theory is invalid, as it relies in one way or another on the aggregation and comparison of actual and ideal prices. This is forcefully argued by Friedrich von Hayek who therefore was skeptical about the objectivity of macroeconomic aggregations as such.Friedrich von Hayek, Individualism and economic order. London: Routledge, 1948. Andrew Gamble, Hayek: the iron cage of liberty. Westview Press, 1996, p. 67-68. However, this raises the question of \\"what is the explanatory power of Austrian economics\\", if all we can say about a realized price is that it expresses a subjective preference, given that there are billions of subjective preferences which are all different.See further e.g. Bruce Caldwell, Hayek's Challenge: an intellectual biography of F.A. Hayek. University of Chicago Press, 2004, part 3. Ecologists and environmentalists have criticized Marx on the ground that natural resources have (or should have) a value which has nothing to do with production costs in labour time, because in fact they are entropic non-reproducible goods.See e.g. Harry Rothman, Murderous providence; a study of pollution in industrial societies. London: R. Hart-Davis, 1972; Elmar Altvater, Gesellschaftliche Produktion und √∂konomische Rationalit√§t - Externe Effekte und zentrale Planung im Wirtschaftssystem des Sozialismus. Frankfurt: EVA, 1969; Barry Commoner, The closing circle : confronting the environmental crisis. London: Cape, 1972; Andre Gorz, Ecology as Politics. South End Press, 1979. However, Marx himself never denied this; he was merely referring to the bourgeois valuation scheme, originating from commercial trade, double-entry bookkeeping, private property theory and the theory of prices.Ernest Mandel, \\"La dialectique de la croissance: √† propos du rapport Mansholt\\". In: Mai (Bruxelles), 1972 (Nov./Dec.): pp. 7‚Äì14. Translated as \\"Marxismus und Ekologie\\" in: Ernest Mandel, Karl Marx: die Aktualit√§t seines Werkes, ed. Willy Boepple. Cologne: ISP verlag, 1984. Precisely because natural resources were for a long time either non-reproducible or freely available goods (i.e. not reproducible commodities) the whole tendency in the market economy was for those resources to be plundered for private gain, rather than economized appropriately.John Bellamy Foster, Marx's Ecology: Materialism and Nature. Monthly Review Press, 2000. Their \\"value\\" became apparent only when they became scarce. Ecologists also note that Marxist theories of value caused large-scale environmental problems in the industrialization of the Soviet Union,Boris Komarov, The Destruction of Nature in the Soviet Union. Pluto Press, 1980 ChinaVaclav Smil, China's Environmental Crisis: An Inquiry into the Limits of National Development. M.E. Sharpe, 1982; Judith Shapiro, Mao's War against Nature: Politics and the Environment in Revolutionary China. Cambridge University Press, 2001. and other countries ruled by communist parties; thus, whether or not an economy is a market economy or a state economy does not seem to make much difference, the problem is rather with the values of human cultures themselves or with industrialization processes as such. This more complex debateFor some thoughtful insights into the current controversies, see: Daniel Ben-Ami, Ferraris for all: in defence of progress. Polity Press, 2010 ; George Monbiot, Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning. Allen Lane, 2006. Richard Smith, \\"Green capitalism: the god that failed\\". Real-world economics review, issue no. 56, March 2011. cannot be dealt with in this article; it may be noted only that newly industrializing countries to a large extent imitated technical methods used in industrialized countries, and that Marx can hardly be held responsible for all the things done in his name‚Äîhe had explicitly referred to problems of environmental despoilation quite a number of times, including in Das Kapital.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I, chapter 15 section 10. In The German Ideology (1845), Marx and Engels commented that \\"In the development of productive forces there comes a stage when productive forces and means of intercourse are brought into being, which, under the existing relationships, only cause mischief, and are no longer forces of production but forces of destruction (machinery and money)\\". ) He never dealt systematically with socialist economics, amongst other things because he lacked an evidential basis for theorizing about that.See further, Alec Nove, The economics of feasible socialism, 2nd ed. Harper Collins, 1991; Makoto Itoh, Political Economy of Socialism. New York: St Martins Press, 1995. =Logical criticism= The logical criticism revolves around the idea that Marx is unable to reconcile the domain of value relations and the domain of price relations, showing exactly how value magnitudes correspond to price magnitudes. Various arguments are made to show that Marx's theory of value is logically incoherent. The most famous of these is the controversy about Marx's prices of production, sometimes called the transformation problem in which it is argued that total output value must equal total output production prices, and total profits must equal total surplus value, so that the distributions of particular output values and output prices can then be inferred from each other, via mathematical functions and a tidy accounting sum, assuming the same rate of profit on capital invested by all sectors.See, for this interpretation, Maurice Dobb, Theories of value and distribution since Adam Smith. Cambridge University Press, 1973, p. 159). However, it cannot be proved, whether logically or empirically, that the total output value is equivalent to total output production prices, or, for that matter, that total profit equals total surplus-value. On that ground alone, many critics argue, there is already no proof that there is any necessary quantitative relationship between them (Marx simply assumes that relationship, but does not prove it).Paul A. Samuelson, \\"Understanding the Marxian Notion of Exploitation: A Summary of the So-Called Transformation Problem Between Marxian Values and Competitive Prices\\". In: Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. 9, No. 2, 1971, p. 400. If that is so, then, the critics argue, there is no sense in which the Marxian product-values can explain market prices for products as the determinants of those prices. An additional problem discovered in mathematical modelling is that the assumption of the identity of total production prices and total values (or the identity of total surplus value and total profits) cannot be maintained simultaneously with the assumption that the rate of profit on production capital is the same for all industries‚Äîto create a consistent theory requires making additional assumptions.The debate is usually considered to have begun in earnest with an article by Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, \\"Wertrechnung und Preisrechnung im Marxschen System\\", in: 1906/7, Archiv f√ºr Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik, XXIII-1 (1906) pp. 1‚Äì50, XXV-1 (1907) pp. 10‚Äì51, XXV-2 (1907) pp. 445‚Äì488. This article was translated into English in 1952 as \\"Value and Price in the Marxian System\\", International Economic Papers, no. 2, 1952. A fairly readable exposition of the transformation problem controversy is provided e.g. in M.C. Howard & J.E. King, The political economy of Marx, Longman, 1975, chapter 5, or in Ronald L. Meek, Smith, Marx and after: ten essays in the development of economic thought. London: Chapman & Hall, 1977, chapters 5, 6, 7. However, there exists no book which reviews all the transformation problem literature. A brief overview is provided online in G√©rard Dum√©nil and Duncan Foley, \\"The Marxian Transformation Problem.\\" Although this is often overlooked by economistsParticipants in the \\"transformation problem\\" controversy assumed the necessity of a uniform rate of profit, while the followers of Moshe Machover and Emmanuel Farjoun (more correctly) argued that a uniform rate of profit had never existed.. But no one in the debate clearly posed the question of why Marx had assumed the same rate of profit for all industries, even when he himself indicated in several places in Capital Vol. 3 that there are continuously differentials in industrial profit rates. Marx himself used a uniform rate of profit for all industries in Capital Vol. 3 only for modelling purposes, to show in a simple way how the ruling profit rates on capital impacted on the development of production system, and he explicitly denied that a uniform rate of profit obtained in reality;Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin ed., p. 490. he only argued that at any time there would exist an average \\"minimum acceptable\\" profit rate on capital invested in industries, and if there was no realistic possibility at all of reaching at least that profit rate sometime in the future, capital would very likely be disinvested after a while, since the relevant business would then simply lack commercial viability; alternatively, the business would be taken over, and restructured to restore an acceptable profit rate. This minimum profit rate applying to new investments is closely linked to the ruling interest rates applicable to producing enterprises.Anwar Shaikh, \\"Crisis and distribution\\", New School Economic Review, Volume 4(1), 2010, pp. 72-76, at p. 72. See also Carlo Panico, Interest and profit in the theories of value and distribution, introd. John Eatwell. London: Macmillan Press, 1988. Marx's \\"general rate of profit\\" specifically represents the \\"minimum profit rate\\" on capital, below which the producers, in the normal run of events, cannot stay in business for long.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, chapter 22, Penguin ed., p. 490. It is neither an empirical average of many profit rates, nor merely a theoretical ratio, but a real systemic constraint. Marx and Engels explicitly denied that in reality total product-value would be equal to the total of production prices (see prices of production). Such an \\"accounting identity\\" was ruled out in the real world by continual variations in labour productivity and because, at any time, no competitive force existed that could exactly cancel out the difference between goods sold above value and goods sold below value.See e.g. chapter 49 in Capital Vol. 3, p. 972. See also Engels's letter to Conrad Schmidt dated March 12, 1895. It was also ruled out by the imperfections of the price-form itself, which, the fetishization of price statistics notwithstanding, permitted the expression of product-values only in an approximate way (see real prices and ideal prices). At best‚ÄîMarx assumed‚Äîthere was a reasonably close correspondence between total product-value and total production prices.Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin ed., p. 261. He believed economic fluctuations implied that if some products were sold below their value, this necessarily meant that other products were sold above their value, and vice versa.Karl Marx, Notes on Adolph Wagner's ‚ÄúLehrbuch der politischen √ñkonomie‚Äù (Second Edition), Volume I, 1879. The divergence between total product-values and total production prices on the whole was, Marx believed, probably not so very large, in an open, competitive market within the domestic economy, where enormous price-value discrepancies were ordinarily impossible to maintain commercially for any length of time.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin edition 1981, chapter 49, p. 971. A measuring unit of value can exist only as a theoretical entity (or as an ideal price comparable to an empirical price) which is also exactly how Marx used it in his simplified illustrations of value relationships. He simply uses a number for the value-quantity and another number for the price-quantity, to indicate a proportion. Empirically, one can only get as far as establishing a \\"grand average\\" for the price of an hour of work (this is often referred to in Marxian economics as the \\"monetary equivalent of labour time\\", or MELT) and one can discuss the extent to which labour is undervalued or overvalued in a relative (comparative) sense.See: Simon Mohun and Roberto Veneziani, \\"The Temporal Single-System Interpretation: Underestimation and Inconsistency\\", Marxism 21, Vol. 6 No. 3, 2009, pp. 277‚Äì99. This interpretation is not accepted by all Marxist scholars, because‚Äîthe critics argue‚Äîall price-value differentials among different outputs are necessarily and by definition cancelled out at the aggregate level, not just in an assumed theoretical model, but in reality. They point to passages where Marx suggests that the sum of product-values must be equal to the sum of production prices, implying that there can never be more new product-value or less product-value than is expressed by the sum total of output production prices.Compare Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin ed., p. 259 and p. 273. If they argue that equality does not hold, then there cannot be any determinate quantitative relationship between production prices and product-values. Product-values in Marx's sense quite simply cannot be directly observed, only inferred from the actual behaviour of trading relations.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III. Penguin, 1981, p. 134. In that regard, Marx's concept of \\"\\"value\\" has exactly the same status as the official category of \\"value added\\" (which is an inferred magnitude). Product-values manifest themselves and can only be expressed as trading ratios, (ideal) prices, or quantities of labour-time, and therefore the academic \\"transformation controversy\\" is according to many modern Marxist theorists misguided; it rests simply on a false interpretation of the relationship between the value-form of commodities and the price-form.Alan Freeman \\"Marx without equilibrium\\" (July 1995)MPRA Paper No. 1207, posted November 2007. What Marx really meant by the \\"transformation\\" was that the direct regulation of the exchange-value of commodities according to their labour-value is, in a capitalist mode of production, transformed into the regulation of the exchange of commodities by their production prices‚Äîreflecting the fact, that the supply of commodities in capitalist society has become conditional on the accumulation of capital, and therefore on profit margins (\\"no profit, no sale\\"). As soon as we admit that product-prices may fluctuate above or below the socially average product-values for all kinds of reasons‚Äîa central determinant of market dynamics‚Äîthe quantitative relationship between product- values and product-prices is at best probabilistic, not a fixed function of some type.Emmanuel Farjoun & Moshe Machover, The Laws of Chaos. London: Verso, 1983.See further: Ian Wright, \\"Implicit Microfoundations for Macroeconomics\\". Economics: The open access, open-assessment e-journal, Vol. 3, No. 19, May 11, 2009. The structure of Marx's argument in Capital Vol. 3 is that there is a constant contradiction in capitalism between the inescapable labour-costs incurred to produce products, and the laws of price competition which create pressure to maximize the return on capital invested‚Äîa contradiction which must constantly be mediated in practice, bringing about the \\"real movement\\" of the production system (ideally, capitalists would prefer just to trade assets without the nuisance and trouble of hiring labor, but the assets have to be produced, that production requires labor, and therefore that labor has to be organized in a commercially effective way).Steven Mufson and Jia Lynn Yang, \\"Capital gains tax rates benefiting wealthy feed growing gap between rich and poor\\", in: Washington Post, 12 September 2011. The only way to transcend the scientific \\"arbitrariness\\" to which the young Marx already referred, was by understanding and theorizing the dynamics of the capitalist system as a whole, integrating all the different economic forces at work into a unified, coherent theory that could withstand the test of scientific criticism.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin ed., chapter 1, p. 117. Thus, Marx's value theory offers an interpretation, generalisation or explanation concerning the \\"grand averages\\" of the relative price movements of products, and of economic behaviour in capitalist production as a social system, but it is not possible to deduce specific real product-prices from product-values according to some mathematical function, among other things because, to find labour-values, a relationship between product-prices and labour hours worked must already be assumed. What we can verify is as follows: *How systems of exchange have functioned in history. *To what extent production-costs and the ruling profit rates actually determine market prices for products. *The relationship between hours worked and outputs produced. *Whether the capitalist production system does indeed evolve historically in the way predicted by value theory.See e.g. Willi Semmler, Competition, Monopoly, and Differential Profit Rates; On the Relevance of the Classical and Marxian Theories of Production Prices for Modern Industrial and Corporate Pricing. Columbia University Press, 1984. =Empirical criticism= The empirical criticism is that Marx's law of value contradicts the known facts about the allocation of resources in capitalist society. The main empirical criticism is simply that there is no observable quantitative correspondence at all between changes in relative expenditures of labour-time, and changes in relative market prices of products, however measured (the measures are also contested, for example on the ground that qualitatively different kinds of labour cannot be compared and equated).Shane Mage, \\"The Law of the Falling Tendency of the Rate of Profit; Its Place in the Marxian Theoretical System and Relevance to the US Economy\\". Phd Thesis, Columbia University, 1963 (available from Scribd). See further: Anwar Shaikh, The Empirical Strength of the Labor Theory of Value. In: Riccardo Bellofiore (ed.), Conference Proceedings of Marxian Economics: A Centenary Appraisal. London: Macmillan, 1998 ; a classic study is Anwar Shaikh & Ergutul Tonak, Measuring the Wealth of Nations: The Political Economy of National Accounts. Cambridge University Press, 1994. Most critics have tried to refute Marx's theory with a mathematical model, rather than looking at real data to see if the capitalist economy really behaves in the way Marx claims it does.See e.g. Anwar Shaikh, \\"Neo-Ricardian economics: a wealth of algebra, a poverty of theory\\". In: Review of radical political economics, Vol. 14 no. 2, 1982. Shaikh and his students subsequently developed a number of empirical tests of Marx's theory of value. A recent empirical criticism has to do with what Marxists call \\"financialization\\".See e.g. by John Bellamy Foster, \\"The financialization of capitalism\\"\\". Monthly Review, Vol. 58, issue 11, April 2007 ;\\"The Financialization of Accumulation\\". Monthly Review, Vol. 62, issue 5, October 2010 ; \\"The Financialization of Capital and the Crisis.\\" Monthly Review, Vol. 59, issue 11, April 2008 . In developed capitalist economies, the majority of workers and capital assets no longer directly participate in the production of new commodities by private enterprise. Many workers work in service industries which manage, maintain or distribute already existing resources. That is the result of two centuries of industrialization and mechanization in developed capitalist countries (plus outsourcing to newly industrializing economies). The bulk of capital assets in developed capitalist countries are not physical means of production used by private enterprise to create new commodities; they are financial assets, real estate and other types of property not used for production. This means that human labour is no longer regarded as the mainspring of wealth-creation, and it raises the question of how the law of value could, in that case, be a regulative force in the allocation of resources, or how it could determine prices. According to Professor Hillel Ticktin: This issue has not yet been resolved, because there is little scientific agreement about how the \\"real economy\\" (producing goods and services) and the \\"financial economy\\" (trading property and assets) are related to each other,For more information, see Willi Semmler, Asset Prices, Booms and Recessions: Financial Economics from a Dynamic Perspective, 2nd edition. Springer, 2006; Jan Toporowski, Theories of financial disturbance. Edward Elgar, 2005. or how the \\"developed world\\" is related economically to the \\"developing world\\". Because \\"globalization\\" can mean almost anything, it does not explain anything about the world economy.David Chandler, Hollow Hegemony: Rethinking Global Politics, Power and Resistance. London: Pluto Press, 2009. Additionally, although Marxists have written many articles in which they very precisely try to classify productive and unproductive labour, there has been no comprehensive organizational analysis of the modern division of labour, or a critical analysis of the statistical categories used to understand it.See, however, Christian Girschner, Die Dienstleistungsgesellschaft. Zur Kritik einer fixen Idee. K√∂ln: PapyRossa Verlag, 2003. Responses to criticism These three lines of criticism lead the critics to the conclusion that Marx's law of value is metaphysical and theoretically useless. Austrian economics goes a step further by attributing no special objective meaning to price levels at all, which it considers a mere \\"statistical outcome\\" of comparisons between each party's ratios between the value of money (taken to be just another kind of a good) to values of goods being sold or purchased. The prices, therefore, are knowledge, which may (or may not) influence behaviour of economic agents differently in each particular case. However, it can be argued that this approach is inconsistent, insofar as nothing in their theory entitles the Austrians to aggregate prices at all; because each price expresses a unique subjective preference, adding up prices is like adding up apples and pears; each price refers to a unique set of circumstances. If the Austrians are correct, there can really be nothing \\"objective\\" about the \\"statistical outcome\\"‚Äîit is merely an interpretation based on numerous valuation assumptions. Marx himself thought that the concept of value was necessary to explain the historical origins, the development and mode of functioning of capitalism as a social system, under conditions where traded, priced assets were only a subset of total assets possessing a potential exchange-value. Short-term price fluctuations could not say anything about the long-term development of the capitalist production system; that required an analysis of the determinants of long-term average price movements, and structural factors. According to primitive economics, all prices are of the same kind and differ only quantitatively; they only express more or less money, and can only go up or down.John Authers, \\"Why 'efficient markets' collapse\\", video interview with Benoit Mandelbrot, in: Financial Times website, 30 September 2009. For Marx, this idea was not only false, but totally absurd, since different kinds of prices can assume different valuation principles, contractual obligations, conditionalities, inclusions/exclusions as well as relationships between economic actors. Different kinds of prices express different kinds of trading relationships. Marx noted that the forms prices take are highly variegated, and he drew a sharp distinction between real prices and ideal prices.Marx, Capital Vol. 1, ch 3, section 1 That is why businessmen assumed a theory of value, even if they were not aware that they were doing it. The scientific theory merely made explicit what they were implicitly assuming for the purpose of doing business.Howard Nicholas, Marx's theory of price and its modern rivals. London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2011. The economists assumed all sorts of things about an economy and economic actors, in order to build models of price behaviour; Marx thought those assumptions themselves needed to be looked at and theorised consistently, based on insight into the historical formation of economic categories. However, his critics claim that his own approach has hidden assumptions as well, and that these assumptions contradict praxeology. Marx anticipated this criticism, which he regarded as very shallow.Letter of Karl Marx to Ludwig Kugelmann, London, 11 July 1868 (MECW, Volume 43, p. 67). In his pamphlet Wages, price and profit (1865), Marx argues that the way economic relationships observably appear to the individual is often the inverse of the real process, considered as a whole.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin ed., Part 7, pp. 953ff. It is perfectly possible not only to participate in market trade without much knowledge of markets and their overall effects, but also to participate in markets with a false or one-sided interpretation of what is really going on in the exchanges. After all, the participants in trading activity all have their own interest in the matter, and look at it from their own point of view. In this sense, Marx warns that market trade can stimulate all sorts of delusions about what relationships are really involved.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin ed., chapter 48, pp. 965-970. Marx also argued that if one could not explain the simplest cases of an economic phenomenon, one could not explain all its variations either; in fact, one could not explain anything at all.Karl Marx, Value, Price and Profit, section 6. Marxists often assumed that Marx provided a theoretical system of what they call \\"the totality\\" (the whole economy, or the whole of society).Martin Jay, Marxism and totality : the adventures of a concept from Luk√°cs to Habermas. Cambridge: Polity Press, 1984. In reality, Marx only aimed to portray the essence of capital, by means of a study of the capitalist mode of production in Western Europe (using illustrations from English industry). According to historical materialism, production is the basis of society, and Marx analyzed that basis. Marxists have also often assumed wrongly that Marx's abstract theory can be applied directly and immediately to observable reality. Yet Marx's historical and logical analysis of economic forms is often an abstraction from observable reality. It is an analysis which only aims to define the essence of economic phenomena (i.e. what their true or overall significance is), based on a critical inspection of the evidence. Thus, Marx often offers only a simplified or idealized account of economic phenomena. The largest part of Marx's economic writings was never published in his lifetime, and was never prepared for publication by Marx himself. The ideology of \\"Marxism\\" was formed already long before all the facts and all the texts became available, which meant that Marx the man, his life and his work were frequently interpreted in a false way.

It was first chanted during the First Crusade in 1096, most likely under the form Deus lo vult or Deus le volt, as reported by the Gesta Francorum (c. 1100‚Äì01) and the Historia Belli Sacri (c. 1130). In modern times, the motto has different meanings depending on the context. It has been used as a metaphor referring to \\"God's will\\", as a motto by religious institutions such as the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, or more recently as an Islamophobic slogan by parts of the Alt-right and white nationalists.  Meaning and variants  The phrase appears in another form in the Vulgate translation of 2 Samuel 14:14 from the Bible: nec vult Deus perire animam (\\"God does not want any soul to perish\\").Vulgate, Regum II, 14:14 Variants of the Crusades motto include Deus lo vult, Deus le volt (both in a form of Romance), Deus id vult (Classical Latin), Dieux el volt (Old French), and Deus hoc vult (Class. Lat., \\"God wills this\\").Mrs. William Busk, Mediaeval Popes, Emperors, Kings, and Crusaders, Or, Germany, Italy, and Palestine, from A.D. 1125 to A.D. 1268, Volume 1 (1854), 15, 396. The two first variants, incorrect in Classical Latin, are forms influenced by Romance languages. According to , the articles 'lo' or 'le' were very likely part of the original motto as shouted in Amalfi, since both the authors of the Gesta Francorum and the Historia Belli Sacri report it. Historian Louis Br√©hier notes that the Gesta Francorum is written in a language situated between Latin, Old French and Old Italian. History = First Crusade = The battle cry of the First Crusade is first reported in the Gesta Francorum, a chronicle written in 1100 or 1101 by an anonymous author associated with Bohemond I of Antioch shortly after the successful campaign. According to this description, as the Princes Crusade gathered in Amalfi in the late summer of 1096, a large number of crusaders armed and bearing the sign of the cross on their right shoulders or on their backs, cried in unison \\"Deus le volt, Deus le volt, Deus le volt\\". Deferunt arma ad bellum congrua; in dextra vel inter utrasque scapulas crucem Christi baiulant; sonum vero 'Deus le volt', 'Deus le volt', 'Deus le volt'! una voce conclamant. Gesta Francorum IV.1 (Hagenmeyer (1890), p. 151.) Medieval historian Guibert de Nogent mentions that \\"Deus le volt\\" (deus id vult) has been retained by the pilgrims to the detriment of other cries. The Historia belli sacri, written somewhat later c. 1131, also cites the battle cry. It is again mentioned in the context of the capture of Antioch on 3 June 1098. The anonymous author of the Gesta was himself among the soldiers capturing the wall towers, and recounts that \\"seeing that they were already in the towers, they began to shout Deus le volt with glad voices; so indeed did we shout\\".Gesta Francorum 20.7, Hagenmeyer (1890), p. 304; some manuscripts also mention cries of kyrie eleison. = Robert the Monk = Robert the Monk in c. 1120 re-wrote the Gesta Francorum because it was considered too \\"rustic\\". He added an account of the speech of Urban II at the Council of Clermont, of which he was an eyewitness. The speech climaxes in Urban's call for orthodoxy, reform, and submission to the Church. Robert records that the pope asked western Christians, poor and rich, to come to the aid of the Greeks in the east: > When Pope Urban had said these and very many similar things in his urbane > discourse, he so influenced to one purpose the desires of all who were > present, that they cried out, 'It is the will of God! It is the will of > God!' When the venerable Roman pontiff heard that, with eyes uplifted to > heaven he gave thanks to God and, with his hand commanding silence, said: > Most beloved brethren, today is manifest in you what the Lord says in the > Gospel, \\"Where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in > the midst of them.\\" Unless the Lord God had been present in your spirits, > all of you would not have uttered the same cry. For, although the cry issued > from numerous mouths, yet the origin of the cry was one. Therefore I say to > you that God, who implanted this in your breasts, has drawn it forth from > you. Let this then be your war-cry in combats, because this word is given to > you by God. When an armed attack is made upon the enemy, let this one cry be > raised by all the soldiers of God: It is the will of God! It is the will of > God!Robert the Monk: Historia Hierosolymitana. in [RHC, Occ III.] Dana C. > Munro, \\"Urban and the Crusaders\\", Translations and Reprints from the > Original Sources of European History, Vol 1:2, (Philadelphia: University of > Pennsylvania, 1895), 5-8 (Medieval Sourcebook). Robert also reports that the cry of Deus lo vult was at first shouted in jest by the soldiers of Bohemond during their combat exercises, and later turned into an actual battle cry, which Bohemond interpreted as a divine sign.Hagenmeyer (1890), p. 151, note 10, citing Historia Regum Francorum mOnast. S. Dionysii (ed. Waitz in Mon. Germ. SS. IX p. 405), and for battle cries of the crusaders in general: Ekk. Hieros. p. 90, 234; R√∂hricht, Beitr√§ge II, 47. Other uses Deus lo vult is the motto of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, a Roman Catholic order of chivalry (restored 1824). Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan, a Protestant Episcopalian, used the expression for his argument of \\"the dominion of Christ\\" as \\"essentially imperial\\" and that \\"Christianity and warfare\\" had a great deal in common: Deus vult!' say I. It was the cry of the Crusaders and of the Puritans and I doubt if man ever uttered a nobler [one].\\" George Flahiff CSB in 1947 used Deus Non Vult as the title of an examination of the gradual loss of enthusiasm for the crusades at the end of the 12th century, specifically of the early criticism of the crusades by Ralph Niger, writing in 1189. George B. Flahiff, \\"Deus Non Vult: A Critic of the Third Crusade\\", Mediaeval Studies 9 (1947), 162-188, doi: 10.1484/J.MS.2.306566. Disseminated in the form of hashtags and internet memes, Deus vult has enjoyed popularity with members of the alt-right because of its perceived representation of the clash of civilizations between the Christian West and the Islamic world. Crusader memes, such as an image of a Knight Templar accompanied by the caption \\"I‚Äôll see your jihad and raise you one crusade\\", are popular on hard-right internet pages. The motto is also used by nationalist groups in Europe and was portrayed on large banners during marches celebrating the Polish National Independence Day in 2017.

It is an off-west end studio theatre. History Jermyn Street opened in August 1994. Formerly the changing rooms for staff at the Spaghetti House restaurant, it was transformed under the leadership of Howard Jameson and Penny Horner into a 70-seat studio theatre. They both remain the Chair of the Board and Executive Director respectively. In 1995, Neil Marcus became the first Artistic Director and Jermyn Street received their Lottery Grant in 1997. During this time, producer Chris Grady contributed to Jermyn Street Theatre‚Äôs development. Princess Michael of Kent became the theatre‚Äôs patron in 1995 and David Babani, later the founder of the Menier Chocolate Factory, took over as artistic director in 1998 until 2001. Jermyn Street Theatre has become a staple of London‚Äôs off-west end studio theatre. It received a lot of attention following successful productions of Barefoot in the Park directed by Sally Hughes and starring Alan Cox and Rachel Pickup, and Helping Harry directed by Nickolas Grace and starring Adrian Lukis and Simon Dutton. In the late 2000s, under the artistic direction of Gene David Kirk, Jermyn Street expanded its repertoire to include revivals of obscure plays such as the UK premiere of St John‚Äôs Night by Henrik Ibsen, Little Eyolf starring Imogen Stubbs and Doreen Mantle by Henrik Ibsen, and the postwar classic The River Line by Charles Morgan. Samuel Beckett‚Äôs All That Fall, premiered at Jermyn Street Theatre in 2012, directed by Trevor Nunn and starring Eileen Atkins and Michael Gambon. It then transferred to the Arts Theatre. and later would transfer to the New York‚Äôs 59E59 Theatre In 2011, Jermyn Street Theatre received a Peter Brook Empty Space Award nomination. One year later, the theatre won The Stage 100 Best Fringe Theatre. Following the rising success of Jermyn Street Theatre under the artistic direction of Gene David Kirk was Anthony Biggs who took over as Artistic Director in 2013. He focused on international playwrights and new works. During Biggs‚Äô time, Jermyn Street Theatre produced a repertory season of South African drama and new works by Jonathan Lewis (A Level Playing Field), Sarah Daniels (Soldiers‚Äô Wives), and American playwright Rae Spiegel (Dry Land). Biggs also revived The First Man by American playwright Eugene O‚ÄôNeill, First World War drama Flowers of the Forest by John Van Druten, and First Episode, Terence Rattigan‚Äôs first play, directed by Tom Littler. In 2017, Tom Littler became Artistic Director. His first production was the world premiere of Howard Brenton‚Äôs The Blinding Light. This marked the sixth production Littler has directed at Jermyn Street Theatre. Previous credits include praised revivals of Stephen Sondheim‚Äôs Anyone Can Whistle and Saturday Night which transferred to the Arts Theatre. Since Tom Littler‚Äôs appointment as Artistic Director, Jermyn Street Theatre has been re-launched into a full-scale producing theatre, with eight to ten productions making up an annual season. The theatre‚Äôs creative output is focused on staging new plays, rare revivals, innovative adaptations of European classics, and outstanding musicals, alongside one-off literary events. Jermyn Street Theatre is committed to ensuring that at least fifty percent of all on stage and off stage creatives are women. In 2018, Littler directed the first complete West End revival of Noel Coward‚Äôs Tonight at 8.30, featuring a cast of nine actors playing 73 roles. Jermyn Street Theatre often co-produces with regional theatres including York Theatre Royal, the Watermill Theatre, Theatre by the Lake, Theatre Royal Bath, Creation Theatre, the Stephen Joseph Theatre, and Guildford Shakespeare Company.

It is located at the corner of Fourth Avenue and Union Street in Brooklyn, New York City, serving the communities of Park Slope, Gowanus and Carroll Gardens. It is served by the R train at all times. The D and N trains also stop here during late nights, and some rush-hour W trains stop here in the peak direction. The Union Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, which was approved in 1905. Construction on the segment of the line that includes Union Street started on December 20, 1909, and was completed in September 1912. The station opened on June 22, 1915, as part of the initial portion of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line to 59th Street. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1926-1927, and again during a renovation in 1968‚Äì1970. The station was also renovated in 1970 and in the mid-1990s. History =Construction and opening= left The Union Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, the plan for which was initially adopted on June 1, 1905. The Rapid Transit Commission was succeeded on July 1, 1907, by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC), which approved the plan for the line in late 1907. The contract for the section of the line that included the Union Street station, Route 11A2, which extended from 10th Street to Sackett Street, was awarded on May 22, 1908, to the E.E. Smith Construction Company for $2,296,234.93 (). The New York City Board of Estimate approved the contract on October 29, 1909. Construction on the segment started on December 20, 1909, and was completed in September 1912. As part of negotiations between New York City, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company for the expansion of the city's transit network, the line was leased to a subsidiary of the BRT. The agreement, known as Contract 4 of the Dual Contracts, was signed on March 19, 1913. Union Street opened on June 22, 1915, as part of an extension of the subway to Coney Island, which included the Fourth Avenue Line north of 59th Street as well as the entire Sea Beach Line. The station's opening was marked with a competition between two trains heading from Chambers Street station in Manhattan to the Coney Island station, one heading via the West End Line and the other via the Sea Beach Line; the latter got to Coney Island first. = Station renovations =  1920s  On June 27, 1922, the New York State Transit Commission directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at 23 stations on the lines of the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), the successor to the BRT, to accommodate eight-car trains. As part of the project, Union Street's platforms would have been lengthened from to . Though the Transit Commission ordered the BMT to lengthen these platforms in September 1923, progress on the extensions did not occur until February 16, 1925, when the New York City Board of Transportation (NYCBOT) directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at this and eleven other stations along the Fourth Avenue Line. It estimated the project's cost to be $633,000 (). The NYCBOT received bids for the project on February 25, 1926. The contract was awarded to the Corson Construction Company for $345,021 (). The extensions opened on August 1, 1927.  1950s and 1960s  In July 1959, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) announced that it would install fluorescent lighting at the Union Street station and five other stations along the Fourth Avenue Line for between $175,000 and $200,000. Bids on the project were to be advertised on August 7, 1959 and completed by fall 1960. In the 1960s, the NYCTA started a project to lengthen station platforms on its lines in Southern Brooklyn to to accommodate 10-car trains. On July 14, 1967, the NYCTA awarded a contract to conduct test borings at eleven stations on the Fourth Avenue Line, including Union Street, to the W. M. Walsh Corporation for $6,585 () in preparation of the construction of platform extensions. The NYCTA issued an invitation for bids on the project to extend the platforms at stations along the Fourth Avenue Line between Pacific Street and 36th Street, including those at Union Street, on March 28, 1969. The contract was awarded to the Horn Construction Company on May 13, 1969, for $7,381,890. Funding for the renovation projects came out of the NYCTA's 1969‚Äì1970 Capital Budget, costing $8,177,890 in total. As part of the renovation project, the station's platforms were extended to the north, and the station's elaborate mosaic tile walls were covered over with white cinderblock tiles. The latter change, which was also made to 15 other stations on the BMT Broadway and Fourth Avenue Line, was criticized for being dehumanizing. The NYCTA spokesman stated that the old tiles were in poor condition and that the change was made to improve the appearance of stations and provide uniformity. Furthermore, it did not consider the old mosaics to have \\"any great artistic merit\\".  1990s  alt= The station was renovated again from 1991 to 1994. The $2.397 million contract for the project was awarded on February 28, 1991. During the closure of the Bay Ridge-bound platform, the glazed tiles at the station were heavily defaced with graffiti, and were cleaned prior to the station's reopening with a heavy duty cleaner, which damaged the glazing. A modification to the contract was approved on May 23, 1994. As part of the modification, new graffiti resistant ceramic tile was installed, signage, advertising panels, benches and trash bins were removed and reinstalled, exhaust systems were added in the porter rooms at both platforms, and the wall-mounted conductors board was replaced by a ceiling- mounted one. The modification cost $174,000, and change orders cost $111,004. The Brooklyn-bound platform was closed between July 15 and November 15, 1991, while the Manhattan-bound platform was closed between February 19 and June 20, 1992. In addition to upgrading the same elements that were replaced in the previous overhaul, floors and track wall tiling, the public announcement system, and safety treads along platform edges and track-beds were replaced. It also included an art installation by Emmett Wigglesworth called CommUnion. It features twenty-two panels of various designs in the recessed area of the platform tiles above the station signs and other designs on the openings in the track walls.  Proposed accessibility  As part of the 2015‚Äì2019 Metropolitan Transportation Authority Capital Program, $300 million was allocated to enhance station access and provide ADA-accessibility at 15 stations chosen by New York City. Four stations were being evaluated for such improvements, including the Union Street station. Station layout View of station artwork. This underground station has four tracks and two side platforms. The R stops here at all times; some rush-hour W trains stop here in the peak direction; and the D and N stop here during late nights, but use the center express tracks to bypass the station during daytime hours. A white tiled curtain wall separates the express tracks from the local tracks. Both platforms are columnless except for a section at their extreme north ends, where they were extended in 1970 to accommodate 10-car trains. Here, the columns are cream colored I-beams. The ceiling is lower in this section. Prior to the station's 1970 renovation, it was finished all in white and marble tile, and it had its own color scheme to allow regular passengers to identify the station based only on the color of the marble trimmings. Since the renovation, the station walls have consisted of white cinderblock tiles, except for small recesses in the walls, which contain gray-painted cinderblock tiles. The gray cinderblock field contains the station-name signs and white text pointing to the exits. =Exits= Each platform has one same-level fare control area in the center and there are no crossovers or crossunders to allow free transfer between directions. The Manhattan-bound side has a fare control area, a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The stairs on the Manhattan-bound platform go up to the southeast corner of Union Street and Fourth Avenue while those on the Bay Ridge-bound platform goes up to the southwest corner. The Bay Ridge-bound side has a fare control area, a turnstile bank without a token booth, and two street stairs.

William J. Sutton served as the first principal. By 1960, Cheney encompassed the largest area of any school district in the state of Washington. The district serves residents in a area, comparable to the size of Dallas, accumulating annually on 47 buses. Cheney School District administration was based in the Fisher Building from 1977 to 2012, formerly built as Cheney High School in 1930. In 2012, administrators moved into the site on Andrus Road, a former Nike missile facility designated F-37 (for the defense of nearby Fairchild Air Force Base) which the district had purchased for $29,000 in 2009. =Robert Reid Lab School= Present-day Eastern Washington University (EWU) started as the Benjamin P. Cheney Academy in 1882 and when Washington gained its statehood in 1889, became the Washington State Normal School at Cheney. As part of the normal school's mission to train prospective teachers, a separate Campus School was established in 1892 to facilitate instruction of education students and student teaching of children. A separate building for the Training School was completed in 1908, funded by a $65,000 appropriation. In 1912, a fire destroyed the main building of the Normal School, and the Training School building was appropriated for Normal School classes, with Training School being held temporarily in an 1893 building owned by Cheney Public Schools. A new building, named Martin Hall (after Governor Clarence D. Martin), was completed for the Training School in 1937 at a cost of $284,000. The old Training School building was condemned and demolished in 1940. The Campus or Training School changed its name to the Laboratory School in 1937 with the move to Martin Hall. The modern building for the Laboratory School, named the Robert Reid Lab School, was built in 1959 immediately west of Martin Hall as a laboratory school at a construction cost of $363,754 for the structure and $41,950 for the land. EWU operated Reid as a separate school district (No. 365) until the 1986‚Äì87 academic year, when it began to be jointly operated by the Cheney School District and EWU. EWU was responsible for the costs of operation, and Cheney School District provided teaching staff and equipment. When parents, faculty members, and education students learned that Reid may be closed as other campus capital projects held higher priorities, they held a march in 2007 in protest. Reid retained features unique to laboratory schools, such as one-way glass, microphones, and observation towers to allow education students to observe classes in session with minimal disruption. Following the 2008‚Äì09 academic year, Reid was permanently closed as the required overhauls could not be funded as the building was owned by Eastern, not Cheney School District, and few student teachers were using the facilities. The building was demolished in 2015 to make way for new science facilities on campus. =Cheney High School (Fisher Building)= Fisher Building (photographed in 2015) With the incorporation of several neighboring school districts in 1929, existing school buildings were expected to be overcrowded due to the influx of new students. A plan was presented to local voters proposing that an existing school building (built in 1893) would be demolished and its bricks salvaged to create a new high school at the same site (520 4th St), to cost no more than $125,000. The first event in the new three-story high school was a basketball game, held on January 7, 1930; classes started approximately two weeks later, on January 22. A new high school was built at 460 N. 6th in 1966, and the 1930 building was repurposed to serve as the junior high school until 1977, when the new Cheney Junior High opened on the edge of town. At that point, the building (then renamed the Fisher Building in honor of educator and Cheney mayor George Fisher) served the district as administrative offices and for special functions until 2013. The building was declared surplus and sold to a developer in 2014. One of the first developers to express interest in the Fisher Building was Cheney alumnus and former NFL player Steve Emtman. After several failed sale attempts, the Fisher Building was sold to a Seattle developer and converted to Multi Family Housing called the \\"School House Lofts\\" in 2017, with 36 apartments aimed at students attending neighboring Eastern Washington University. Portions of the building were preserved in their original configuration, including half the gym and a portion of the balcony on the gym's perimeter. The buyer of the Fisher Building, Eastmark Properties, placed the building on the Cheney Historic Register before finalizing the sale, enabling it to take advantage of tax credits for refurbishing historic buildings. =Cheney and Westwood Middle Schools= Two identical buildings were completed in 2012 to serve as Cheney Middle School (adjacent to the site of the junior high school constructed in 1977, at 2716 N. 6th) and Westwood Middle School (at the site of Windsor Elementary in unincorporated Spokane County, near Spokane International Airport). The exterior of Cheney Middle School was painted blue, and Westwood was painted red. Each building is and had nearly identical costs of $24 million (Cheney) and $26 million (Westwood), with the extra cost for Westwood required for site preparation. The buildings were designed by NAC Architecture. =Snowdon Elementary= Ground was broken for a new elementary school in 2012. Cheney School District opened its eighth school building, Snowdon Elementary, for the 2014‚Äì15 academic year. Snowdon was named in honor of the late Phil Snowdon, who had served as superintendent of Cheney School District. Students at Snowdon were drawn from the existing Windsor and Sunset elementaries to relieve district overcrowding. Snowdon has and was also designed by NAC Architecture.

Since this is a story dealing only with humans, it allows the point to be made directly through the medium of speech rather than be surmised from the situation. It is numbered 225 in the Perry Index. Aesop's Fable Parable of the Hidden Treasure by Rembrandt (c. 1630) The basic story concerns a miser who reduced his riches to a lump of gold, which he buried. Coming back to view it every day, he was spied on and his treasure stolen. As the man bewailed his loss, he was consoled by a neighbour that he might as well bury a stone (or return to look at the hole) and it would serve the same purpose for all the good his money had done him or that he had done with his money. Since versions of the fable were confined to Greek, it only began to gain greater currency during the European Renaissance. Gabriele Faerno made it the subject of a Latin poem in his Centum Fabulae (1563). In England it was included in collections of Aesop's fables by Roger L'Estrange as \\"A miser burying his gold\\" and by Samuel Croxall as \\"The covetous man\\". Appreciating the cut and thrust of the argument, the composer Jerzy Sapieyevski included the fable as the fourth his Aesop Suite (1984), set for brass quintet and narrator, as an example of how ‚Äòmusical elements lurk in gifted oratorical arguments‚Äô.There is a performance online at the Music Happens site Alternative versions The story was made the occasion for commenting on the proper use of riches by authors in both the East and the West. In Saadi Shirazi's Bostan (The Garden, 1257), the Persian poet retells it as ‚ÄúA miserly father and his prodigal son‚Äù.G. S Davie, The Garden of Fragrance: Being a Complete Translation of the BostƒÅan of Sadi, 1882, pp. 110-11; available in Google Books The son spies on his father to discover where he has hidden his wealth, digs it up and substitutes a stone. When the father finds that it has all been squandered, his son declares that spending is what money is for, otherwise it is as useless as a stone. In La Fontaine's Fables, where the fable appears as L'avare qui a perdu son tr√©sor (IV.20), the story is made the occasion for a meditation on the nature of ownership. It begins with the statement 'Possessions have no value till we use them' and uses the story as an illustration of someone who is owned by the gold rather than being its owner.The Complete Fables of Jean de La Fontaine, translated by Norman Shapiro, University of Illinois 2007, p.101 In Germany, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing gave the ending an additional twist in his retelling. What drives the miser to distraction, in addition to his loss, is that someone else is the richer for it.Fables and Epigrams of Lessing translated from the German, London 1825, Fable 14 Meanwhile, a parallel fable had entered European literature based upon a symmetrical two-line epigram in the Greek Anthology, once ascribed to Plato but more plausibly to Statillius Flaccus. A man, intending to hang himself, discovered hidden gold and left the rope behind him; the man who had hidden the gold, not finding it, hanged himself with the noose he found in its place.The Greek Anthology III, London 1917, pp.25-6 The 3rd century CE Latin poet Ausonius made a four-line version,Ausonius with an English translation by Hugh G. Evelyn White, London 1921, p.161 the Tudor poet Thomas Wyatt extended this to eight lines and the Elizabethan George Turberville to twelve.Cambridge History of English Literature III, London p.187 Early in the 17th century, John Donne alluded to the story and reduced it to a couplet again: ::::Look, how he look'd that hid the gold, his hope, ::::And at return found nothing but a rope.Elegy XIV, \\"A tale of a citizen and his wife\\", lines 64-5 The longest telling and interpretation of the episode was in the 76 lines of Guillaume Gu√©roult's First Book of Emblems (1550) under the title \\"Man proposes but God disposes\\".Glasgow University emblems project In the following century, La Fontaine added this story too to his Fables as the lengthy ‚ÄúThe treasure and the two men‚Äù (IX.15).

The creek in the foreground is Williams Creek, which is paralleled by Main Street throughout. The Cariboo Gold Rush was a gold rush in the Colony of British Columbia, which earlier joined the Canadian province of British Columbia. The first gold discovery was made at Hills Bar in 1858, followed by more strikes in 1859 on the Horsefly River, and on Keithley Creek and Antler Creek in 1860. The actual rush did not begin until 1861, when these discoveries were widely publicized. By 1865, following the strikes along Williams Creek, the rush was in full swing. Towns grew up, the most famous of these being Barkerville, now preserved as a heritage site and tourist attraction. Other important towns of the Cariboo gold rush era were Keithley Creek, Quesnel Forks or simply \\"the Forks\\", Antler, Richfield, Quesnellemouthe (which would later be shortened to Quesnel), Horsefly and, around the site of the Hudson's Bay Company's fort of the same name, Alexandria. Williams Creek =Richfield= Richfield was the first strike on Williams Creek, and became the seat of government in the region, particularly of the courts. Connected to Barkerville via the canyon of Williams Creek, Richfield became part of \\"Greater Barkerville\\" along with Cameron Town. Differences between the Cariboo and Fraser Canyon Rushes The Cariboo Gold Rush is the most famous of the gold rushes in British Columbia, so much so that it is sometimes erroneously cited as the reason for the creation of the Colony of British Columbia. The Colony's creation had been prompted by an influx of American prospectors to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush three years earlier in 1858, which had its locus in the area from Lillooet to Yale. Unlike its southern counterpart, the population of the Cariboo Gold Rush was largely British and Canadian, among them 4000 were Chinese, although the first wave of the rush was largely American. By the time the Cariboo rush broke out there was more active interest in the Gold Colony (as British Columbia was often referred to) in the United Kingdom and Canada and there had also been time required for more British and Canadians to get there. The electorate of the Cariboo riding were among the most pro-Confederation in the colony, and this was in no small part because of the strong Canadian element in the local populace. One reason the Cariboo rush attracted fewer Americans than the original Fraser rush may have been the American Civil War, with many who had been around after the Fraser Gold Rush going home to take sides, or to the Fort Colville Gold Rush which was largely manned by men who had been on the Fraser or to other BC rushes such as those at Rock Creek and Big Bend. While some of the population that came for the Cariboo rush stayed on as permanent settlers, taking up land in various parts of the Interior in the 1860s and after, that wasn't the general rule for those involved in the Fraser rush. Many veterans of the Cariboo would spread out to explore the rest of the province, in particular triggering the Omineca and Cassiar Gold Rushes, just as the Cariboo itself had been found by miners seeking out in search of new finds from the Fraser rush.

Trails, Roads and Water Routes in Colonial British Columbia. The Dewdney Trail was the dotted line across the south of the colony. The boom in the Cariboo goldfields was the impetus for the construction of the Cariboo Wagon Road by the Royal Engineers, which bypassed the older routes via the Fraser Canyon and the Lakes Route (Douglas Road) via Lillooet by using the canyon of the Thompson River to Ashcroft and from there via the valley of the Bonaparte River to join the older route from Lillooet at Clinton. Towns along the Cariboo Road include Clinton, 100 Mile House and Williams Lake, although most had their beginnings before the Cariboo rush began. During the rush, the largest and most important town lay at the road's end at Barkerville, which had grown up around the most profitable and famous of the many Cariboo mining camps. The Cariboo Road in the Fraser Canyon, 1867 The Cariboo Wagon Road was an immense infrastructure burden for the colony but needed to be built to enable access and bring governmental authority to the Cariboo goldfields, which was necessary in order to maintain and assert control of the wealth, which might more easily have passed through the Interior to the United States. The wagon road's most important freight was the Gold Escort, which brought government bullion to Yale for shipment to the colonial treasury. Despite the wealth of the Cariboo goldfields, the expense of colonizing the Cariboo contributed to the Mainland Colony's virtual bankruptcy and its forced union with the Island Colony, and similarly into Confederation.

This line is called the Eliyya line, because of the name that each of its successive patriarchs assumed. In 1771, the Alqosh Patriarch Eliyya XII Denkha (1722‚Äì1778) entered communion with the Catholic Church. However, on his death in 1778, his successor Eliyya XIII Isho øyahb, after obtaining recognition by Rome, quickly repudiated the union and returned to the traditional doctrine. His cousin Yohannan VIII Hormizd professed the Catholic faith and won others to the same faith. When Eliyya IX Isho øyahb died in 1804, no successor was elected and Yohannan Hormizd remained the only representative of the line. Rome recognized him in 1783 as metropolitan bishop of Mosul and administrator of the Alqosh/Mosul patriarchate. Only in 1830, after the death in 1827 of Augustine Hindi, the representative of the Josephite line, who had also been under consideration for recognition as the Catholic patriarch, was he acknowledged by Rome as patriarch. * 103 Yohannan VIII Hormizd (1830‚Äì1838) ‚Äî had his see in Mosul * 104 Nicholas I Zaya (1839‚Äì1846) * 105 Joseph VI Audo (1847‚Äì1878) * 106 Eliya XIV Abulyonan (1878‚Äì1894) * 107 Audishu V Khayyath (1894‚Äì1899) (Georges Ebed- Iesu) * 108 Yousef VI Emmanuel II Thomas (1900‚Äì1946) * 109 Yousef VII Ghanima (1946‚Äì1958) ‚Äî moved the see to Baghdad * 110 Paul II Cheikho (1958‚Äì1989) * 111 Raphael I Bidawid (1989‚Äì2003) * 112 Emmanuel III Delly (2003‚Äì2012) (retired on 19 December 2012) * 113 Louis Rapha√´l I Sako (31 January 2013‚Äìpresent) See also * Chaldean Catholic Patriarchate of Babylon * List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East *Assyrian Church of the East *Assyria *Assyrian people Sources  * * References External links * Chaldean Patriarchate of Babylon by GCatholic.org * Eastern Uniate Patriarchs from World Statesmen.org * Category:Eastern Catholicism-related lists Category:Iraq religion-related lists Chaldean Category:1552 establishments in the Ottoman Empire Category:1661 establishments in the Ottoman Empire Category:1830 establishments in the Ottoman Empire Chaldean ","title":"List of Chaldean Catholic Patriarchs of Babylon"},{"id":"2200249","text":"Henry Gross (born April 1, 1951) is an American singer-songwriter best known for his association with the group Sha Na Na and for his hit song, \\"Shannon\\". Early years Gross was born in Brooklyn, New York City. His mother's love for music encouraged his pursuit of a performing career. At age 13 he performed at the New Jersey Pavilion at the World's Fair in Flushing, New York with his first band, The Auroras. By age 14, he was playing regularly in local clubs in the New York area, and spending his summers playing at Catskill Mountains resort hotels. At age 18, while a student at Brooklyn College, Gross became a founding member of 1950's Rock & Roll revival group, Sha Na Na, playing guitar and wearing the greaser clothes he wore while a student at Midwood High School. Going solo Gross left Sha Na Na to become a solo singer-songwriter in 1970. He signed a recording contract with ABC Dunhill Records in 1971. While there, he did some session work for producers Tommy West and Terry Cashman. He played electric lead guitar on the Jim Croce album, I Got a Name. His own debut album had little commercial success. He continued to play at clubs and colleges until 1973, when he signed with A&M; Records. His first self-titled A&M; album sold well. It included several regional hits including \\"Simone\\", \\"Come On Say It\\", \\"Skin King\\", and a cover version of Lindisfarne's European hit, \\"Meet Me on the Corner\\". With Gross' second A&M; album, Plug Me into Something, he began to achieve national recognition in Rolling Stone and The New York Times. \\"Shannon\\" Gross moved on to Lifesong Records to make his next album. He produced a single, \\"Shannon\\", a song written about the death of former Beach Boys member Carl Wilson's dog, who was named Shannon. The single went gold in the U.S. and became a worldwide hit, reaching No. 6 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and No. 5 on the Cash Box Top 100 in 1976. In Canada it reached No. 1 in May of the same year. \\"Shannon\\" also reached No. 1 in New Zealand, but peaked only at No. 32 in the UK. After this single's success, Gross released the album, Release. His second single, \\"Springtime Mama\\", reached No. 37 in the US, selling nearly a million copies. On his next album, Show Me to the Stage, Gross mixed rock and roll songs with Phil Spector and Brian Wilson influences. While the album sold well, it provided no hit singles. He also recorded The Beatles song \\"Help!\\" for the documentary, All This and World War II; both occurred in 1976. Gross' recording career slowed, but with CBS Records he made \\"Love Is the Stuff\\" and with Capitol Records, in 1981, along with Bobby Colomby, produced the What's in a Name album. As a session guitarist Henry performed on many records by other artists including Jim Croce (I Got A Name, ABC Records 1973) Judy Collins (Home Again, Elektra/ Asylum 1984), and Andy Kim (Baby, I Love You, Steed/Dot Records 1970). His songs have been recorded by a variety of artists including Judy Collins, Mary Travers, Cyndi Lauper, Jonathan Edwards, Henry Paul, Blackhawk, Southside Johnny, Garry Tallent and Rob Stoner. In the 1980s, Gross performed in the road company production of Pump Boys and Dinettes with a cast featuring Jonathan Edwards (Sunshine) and Nicolette Larson (Lotta Love). Gross moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1986 and signed a publishing deal with Pic-A-Lic Music, a company owned by songwriters Roger Cook and Ralph Murphy. 1990‚Äìpresent Gross continued his songwriting and recording career in Nashville. In 1993, he released the album Nothing But Dreams on his own record label, Zelda Records, named after his mother. He had a Top 40 Country Radio hit, \\"Big Guitar\\" for the Arista recording group Blackhawk, fronted by his good friend, Henry Paul. Gross released I'm Hearing Things on Zelda Records in 2001. He has also written and currently performs a one-man show called \\"One Hit Wanderer\\", chronicling the highlights and funniest moments of his life in and out of the entertainment business. He continues to record in Fort Myers, Florida with multi-instrumentalist and recording engineer John McLane, having produced four albums with 74 tracks: One Hit Wanderer (2006), Foreverland (2007), Rhymes and Misdemeanors and Right as Rain (2011). A single was released, \\"What a Christmas\\", the same year. As a further accomplishment, he released a trio album in 2011 with Jonathan Edwards and Henry Paul, titled Edwards, Gross & Paul AKA \\"The Vereens\\". In 2016 Henry traveled to the UK to support long time friend Joe Brown on his Just Joe UK tour. Joe and Henry played a selection of hits from Joe and Henry's discography as well as a selection of rock and roll and country hits. The tour was a resounding success with the vast majority of the shows selling out. In early 2017 before leaving for the UK, Henry, on his Zelda Records label, released three new CD's, \\"Mixed Messages\\", \\"Stories I've Lived To Tell\\" and \\"New Orleans, New Orleans\\" ‚Äì a collection of songs from a new musical comedy play of the same name, written by Henry and playwright Ed Greenberg. In October 2017, the pair went back on the road with the same show, this time backed up by the live album, produced by Henry, recorded during the 2016 tour. The tour ran through October and November 2017 before breaking for Christmas. They went back on the road in 2018 from January through March. In 2019, while doing many shows celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Woodstock Festival, Henry continued his recording journey with multi instrumentalist/ engineer, John Mclane, completing and releasing the new 17 song CD, Too Clever (For My Own Good) in February 2020 on Zelda Records.

The municipality covers an area of . Borders The municipality shares its border on the north with the state of Zacatecas and the Mezquitic Municipality, to the south with Bola√±os Municipality and Chimaltit√°n Municipality. To the east, it shares its border with Totatiche Municipality and to the west with Mezquitic Municipality. Population The population of the municipality in 2005 was 5,182 inhabitants, of which 3,503 lived in the municipal seat of Villa Guerrero. The remaining population was spread throughout the rural areas within the municipality's borders. Some other notable localities within these borders include Ojo de Agua, Azquelt√°n, Santa Rita, Las Adjuntas, Izolta, La Cienega de Marquez, Uribes and Patagua. The municipality has suffered decreasing population in recent decades, largely due to emigration. In 2000, 31% of the working population was employed in agriculture and husbandry, 14% in construction, 13% in commerce and 13% in manufacturing. History Prior to the Spanish conquest, the municipality of Villa Guerrero was inhabited by the indigenous Tepecan (Tepehuan). The area was conquered by the Spanish Captain Pedro Alm√≠ndez Chirino, sent by Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n in the year 1530. Shortly after the arrival of the Spanish into the area, the Huichol (Wixarika) migrated to the area's remote canyons and mountains. The Spanish settlement of the area at the end of the 16th century brought a number of Tlaxcaltec colonizers to the area. In its origins it was named \\"Xonacatic\\", which means \\"place of onions\\", but not of the edible onion, but of those commonly known as \\"chives\\", which are born alone in times of water and in muddy places. The oldest Spanish land grant in the area was in 1579 to Luis de los Rios Proa√±o. The grant was for approximately 120 km¬≤ in the valley of Juanacatic (from the indigenous name for the valley: Xoncacatic, meaning place of the onions). Missions were founded by the Franciscans in the area in the latter years of the 16th century. In the early 17th century, the area was the scene of a number of indigenous uprisings, including one by the Wixarika and Tepecan in 1607, resulting in its abandonment by the few Spanish settlers. In 1622, the descendants of the original grantee took interest once again in the land, seeking out titles in Zacatecas. The land was eventually sold to Captain Juan de Escobedo and Captain Juan Diaz de Infante. Around 1673, European settlement in the region was still limited, with only one agricultural hacienda in the region known as Juanacatic. By 1673, the place was an agricultural and cattle ranch called Juanacatic, owned by the Spanish captain Juan de Escobedo.https://jalisco.gob.mx/jalisco/municipios/villa-guerrero In 1676, the Spanish military administrator for the region of Colotl√°n Toribio Gonz√°lez de Escalante, began the extraction of saltpeter in the valley. From this activity, the place gained the name of El Salitre. Eventually the extraction of saltpeter ceased due to its cost inefficiency and the administrator's inability to retain sufficient labor. In 1702, the Tepehuan and Wixarika from the nearby mountains and canyons joined forces in a rebellion. The result was an adjudication by the Spanish Crown that forced the major Spanish landowner, Ana de Santiago, widow of Juan Diaz de Infante, to trade some of her agricultural land in the plateau for land in the canyon. Thus the Tepehuan regained part of their historic lands in a location known as Patahua. The Tepehuan community received an official grant for the land in 1733. In 1779, the Juanacatic hacienda was acquired by Pedro de Llanos y Vald√©s as the area began to experience large flows of European immigration. Agricultural activity and husbandry benefited from the mining activities in nearby Bola√±os, which had begun large scale production in the 1730s. El Salitre became a regular stopover of the mule trains that transported the ore out of the canyon. There were several battles in 1810 during the war for independence fought in the region. Many of the local indigenous groups, including the Wixarika fought on the side of the Spanish Crown. Political reforms, such as the Iguala Plan undertaken in 1821 by the newly independent government extinguished separate treatment of indigenous communities and communal lands of the Tepehuan were distributed to individuals. In 1838, the area was made part of the 8th Canton of the free and sovereign state of Jalisco, within the Mexican Republic and was assigned to the municipality of Totatiche within that canton. Construction on a stone church to replace the adobe chapel of the town of El Salitre began in 1905. The work was completed nearly two decades later, following the Mexican Revolution. Soon thereafter, in 1921, the municipality was separated from the municipality of Totatiche and declared an independent municipality by the state legislature and renamed Villa Guerrero in honor of Vicente Guerrero.

The team debuted in 1988 and disbanded in 2002. History =Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling= Sting and Lex Luger first teamed up in April 1988 after Luger found himself without a tag team partner for the 1988 Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament in the wake of former partner Barry Windham turning on Luger and taking Luger's old spot in The Four Horsemen and Ron Garvin's injury at the hands of The Varsity Club. They won the tournament and would periodically team up in between their careers as singles competitors. Their team was seemingly defunct after Luger turned heel in June 1989, but Sting was also the cause of Luger's face turn in February 1990, as Luger replaced Sting as the #1 contender for Ric Flair's NWA World Title while Sting was out with a knee injury. While Luger failed to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, he would end up winning what would eventually become WCW's primary World Title, the WCW World Title on two occasions. They teamed up again as part of the Dudes With Attitudes in World Championship Wrestling to battle The Four Horsemen in 1990. They did not form a regular team again at this point, although they would pair up occasionally, most notably to challenge The Steiner Brothers for the WCW World Tag Team Championship at SuperBrawl I. The two would feud again in 1991 when Flair left WCW for the World Wrestling Federation and Luger turned heel while winning the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Sting won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Luger at SuperBrawl II on February 29, 1992. Luger left WCW after losing the title. The next time they teamed was in September 1995 in WCW when Luger made a return to WCW on the first Monday Nitro. Sting was helping Hulk Hogan and \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage in their feud with The Four Horsemen and The Dungeon of Doom and Luger joined up. Luger bickered with Savage and Hogan, and Sting always had to keep the peace. At WCW Halloween Havoc 1995 on October 29, Luger joined Jimmy Hart and turned heel when he attacked Hogan. He continued his team with Sting and they won the WCW World Tag Team Championship on January 22, 1996 on Nitro when they defeated Harlem Heat. During their reign, Luger was a heel and Sting was a face. During their reign, they feuded with Harlem Heat and the returning Road Warriors. They finally lost the titles on June 24, 1996 to Harlem Heat when The Outsiders caused a distraction at ringside, during a match, which also included The Steiner Brothers. Their team ended in September 1996 when Luger believed that Sting joined the New World Order (nWo). In reality, it was The nWo Sting, and Sting soon turned his back on Luger. They eventually made peace when Sting saved Luger from a gang attack by the nWo. They both joined the nWo rebel faction \\"Wolfpac\\" in May 1998 when the nWo split and teamed together occasionally. However, Sting disappeared from WCW in October due to a severe knee injury and the team was dissolved after the Wolfpac rejoined with the rest of the nWo in January 1999. Luger remained a part of the reunited faction while Sting returned to feud with nWo leader Hogan and others when he returned in March 1999. In September 1999, Luger and Sting reunited when Luger helped Sting defeat Hogan at Fall Brawl, turning Sting heel in the process. However, the team was broken up after Starrcade in December 1999 and began a short feud which ended when Luger broke Sting's wrist by stomping on it while it was enclosed in a steel chair. The two later became allies again in the Millionaire's Club, but Luger was injured shortly thereafter and he and Sting went their separate ways. =World Wrestling All-Stars= In November 2002, Luger and Sting briefly teamed together in World Wrestling All-Stars until Luger turned on him starting another feud over the WWA World Heavyweight Championship.

Since he first appeared on the film scene in 1989, Schnaas has become a leader in Germany's ultra-violent low-budget horror film industry. Schnaas was the first in a series of maverick directors making underground movies who began a sustained revival of German horror cinema post World War II.  Early years  Andreas Schnaas was born in Hamburg and embraced cinema at a very young age. Since many of the local theaters in his city did not care about how young their patrons were, he was exposed to violent martial arts, zombie films, and splatter very early on in his life. Schnaas' parents were not always pleased with his choice of entertainment, but recognized his artistic talents and vivid imagination. He used this imagination, compounded with his love of horror, to make his first film at age twelve. The film, entitled Hunted, featured Andreas and his friend ruthlessly killing an elderly man, who was played by his grandfather. His father filmed this feature, as well as many other movies that the boys made over the next several years. It was not until 1989, however, that he mustered together five thousand marks - enough to make his first full-length feature.  Filmmaking  Shot with his friends over four \\"extremely long\\" weekends, Schnaas' gory tale of \\"Karl the Butcher\\", entitled Violent Shit, went on to become Germany's first direct-to-video horror film. An immediate success, the film quickly appeared in American video stores and throughout the rest of Europe. The German government banned Violent Shit immediately after its release. When asked where he came up with such a vulgar title for his film, the director once explained that a pen pal in New Zealand once playfully told him, ‚ÄúAll you‚Äôre making is violent shit,‚Äù and it stuck. That pen pal grew into producer Ant Timpson, the creator of the ABCs of Death films. Still spiraling off Violent Shit‚Äôs unexpected success, Andreas created his homage to the undead with Zombie 90 - Extreme Pestilence (1990), the English version of which is regarded by some genre fans to have the most hilarious dubbing ever put to celluloid. The following year, he decided to continue the story of Karl with Violent Shit 2: Mother Hold My Hand, eventually releasing it in 1992. Due to an intense fan interest through his official website, Andreas decided to continue the Violent Shit series - filming the third chapter of the trilogy the next year. Budget constraints kept the film from being released for years, but it eventually saw the light of day in 1999 under the title, Violent Shit III: Infantry of Doom (or Zombie Doom in the US). Andreas also played the killer, Karl, in all three films. His following film was Der Kelch - Goblet of Gore of 1996, although various issues kept it shelved until 2005. As a homage to Italian director Joe D'Amato, he then remade the classic slasher film, Anthropophagous, changing the title to Anthropophagous 2000 (1999). It was also in 1999 that Andreas began preparing for his next film, which he would release as his ‚Äúmillennium shocker‚Äù. The movie, Demonium (2001), was his first 35MM project, made with completely professional actors and shot in English. In 2003 Schnaas directed his first film in America, Nikos, featuring Joe Zaso and Felissa Rose. After that, he created the zombie action film Don't Wake the Dead (2006) and, in 2009, directed two films with fellow German auteur Timo Rose - Unrated and Karl vs Axe, the latter of which being the latest chapter in his Violent Shit series. At least one of his regular collaborators has gone on to mainstream success in the horror genre. Writer-Director Ted Geoghegan, whose We Are Still Here became one of 2015's most critically acclaimed horror films, wrote his first two screen plays with Schnaas.

Of all the other planets in the Solar System, it is the one nearest to Earth and most like it in terms of mass, but has no magnetic field or recognizable plate tectonic system. Much of the ground surface is exposed volcanic bedrock, some with thin and patchy layers of soil covering, in marked contrast with Earth, the Moon, and Mars. Some impact craters are present, but Venus is similar to Earth in that there are fewer craters than on the other rocky planets that are largely covered by them. This is due in part to the thickness of the Venusian atmosphere disrupting small impactors before they strike the ground, but the paucity of large craters may be due to volcanic re- surfacing, possibly of a catastrophic nature. Volcanism appears to be the dominant agent of geological change on Venus. Some of the volcanic landforms appear to be unique to the planet. There are shield and composite volcanoes similar to those found on Earth. Given that Venus has approximately the same size, density, and composition as Earth, it is plausible that volcanism may be continuing on the planet today, as demonstrated by recent studies Most of the Venusian surface is relatively flat; it is divided into three topographic units: lowlands, highlands, and plains. In the early days of radar observation the highlands drew comparison to the continents of Earth, modern research has shown that this is superficial and the absence of plate tectonics makes this comparison misleading. Tectonic features are present to a limited extent, including linear \\"deformation belts\\" composed of folds and faults. These may be caused by mantle convection. Many of the tectonic features such as tesserae (large regions of highly deformed terrain, folded and fractured in two or three dimensions), and arachnoids (for those features resembling a spider's web) are associated with volcanism. Eolian landforms are not widespread on the planet's surface, but there is considerable evidence the planet's atmosphere causes the chemical weathering of rock, especially at high elevations. The planet is remarkably dry, with only a chemical trace of water vapor (20 ppm) in the Venusian atmosphere. No landforms indicative of past water or ice are visible in radar images of the surface. The atmosphere shows isotopic evidence of having been stripped of volatile elements by offgassing and solar wind erosion over time, implying the possibility that Venus may have had liquid water at some point in the distant past; no direct evidence for this has been found. Much speculation about the geological history of Venus continues today. The surface of Venus is not easily accessible because of the extremely thick atmosphere (some 90 times that of Earth's) and the surface temperature. Much of what is known about it stems from orbital radar observations, because the surface is permanently obscured in visible wavelengths by cloud cover. In addition, a number of landers have returned data from the surface, including images. Topography Venus topography The surface of Venus is comparatively flat. When 93% of the topography was mapped by Pioneer Venus Orbiter, scientists found that the total distance from the lowest point to the highest point on the entire surface was about , about the same as the vertical distance between the Earth's ocean floor and the higher summits of the Himalayas. This similarity is to be expected as the maximum attainable elevation contrasts on a planet are largely dictated by the strength of the planet's gravity and the mechanical strength of its lithosphere, these are similar for Earth and Venus. According to data from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter altimeters, nearly 51% of the surface is located within 500 meters (1640 feet) of the median radius of ; only 2% of the surface is located at elevations greater than from the median radius. The altimetry experiment of Magellan confirmed the general character of the landscape. According to the Magellan data, 80% of the topography is within of the median radius. The most important elevations are in the mountain chains that surround Lakshmi Planum: Maxwell Montes (11 km, 6.8 mi), Akna Montes (7 km, 4.3 mi) and Freya Montes (7 km, 4.3 mi). Despite the relatively flat landscape of Venus, the altimetry data also found large inclined plains. Such is the case on the southwest side of Maxwell Montes, which in some parts seems to be inclined some 45¬∞. Inclinations of 30¬∞ were registered in Danu Montes and Themis Regio. About 75% of the surface is composed of bare rock. Based on altimeter data from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter probe, supported by Magellan data, the topography of the planet is divided into three provinces: lowlands, deposition plains, and highlands. =Highlands= Aphrodite Terra topography This unit covers about 10% of the planet's surface, with elevations greater than . The largest provinces of the highlands are Aphrodite Terra, Ishtar Terra, and Lada Terra, as well as the regions Beta Regio, Phoebe Regio and Themis Regio. The regions Alpha Regio, Bell Regio, Eistla Regio and Tholus Regio are smaller regions of highlands. Some of the terrain in these areas is particularly efficient at reflecting radar signals. This is possibly analogous to snow lines on Earth and is likely related to temperatures and pressures there being lower than in the other provinces due to the higher elevation, which allows for distinct mineralogy to occur. It is thought that high-elevation rock formations may contain or be coated by minerals that have high dielectric constants. The high dielectric minerals would be stable at the ambient temperatures in the highlands, but not on the plains that comprise the rest of the planet's surface. Pyrite, an iron sulfide, matches these criteria and is widely suspected as a possible cause; it would be produced by chemical weathering of the volcanic highlands after long-term exposure to the sulfur-bearing Venusian atmosphere. The presence of pyrite on Venus has been contested, with atmospheric modeling showing that it might not be stable under Venusian atmospheric conditions. Other hypotheses have been put forward to explain the higher radar reflectivity in the highlands, including the presence of a ferroelectric material whose dielectric constant changes with temperature (with Venus having a changing temperature gradient with elevation). It has been observed that the character of the radar-bright highlands is not consistent across the surface of Venus. For example, Maxwell Montes shows the sharp, snow line-like change in reflectivity that is consistent with a change in mineralogy, whereas Ovda Regio shows a more gradual brightening upwards trend. The brightening upwards trend on Ovda Regio is consistent with a ferroelectric signature, and has been suggested to indicate the presence of chlorapatite. =Deposition plains= Deposition plains have elevations averaging 0 to 2 km and cover more than half of the planet's surface. =Lowlands= The rest of the surface is lowlands and generally lies below zero elevation. Radar reflectivity data suggest that at a centimeter scale these areas are smooth, as a result of gradation (accumulation of fine material eroded from the highlands). Surface observations Ten spacecraft have successfully landed on Venus and returned data, all were flown by the Soviet Union. Venera 9, 10, 13, and 14 had cameras and returned images of soil and rock. Spectrophotometry results showed that these four missions kicked up dust clouds on landing, which means that some of the dust particles must be smaller than about 0.02 mm. The rocks at all four sites showed fine layers, some layers were more reflective than others. Experiments on rocks at the Venera 13 and 14 sites found that they were porous and easily crushed (bearing maximum loads of 0.3 to 1 MPa) these rocks may be weakly lithified sediments or volcanic tuff. Spectrometry found that the surface materials at the Venera 9, 10, 14 and Vega 1 and 2 landing had chemical compositions similar to tholeiitic basalts, while the Venera 8 and 13 sites chemically resembled alkaline basalts. Impact craters and age estimates of the surface Danilova crater in relief Earth-based radar surveys made it possible to identify some topographic patterns related to craters, and the Venera 15 and Venera 16 probes identified almost 150 such features of probable impact origin. Global coverage from Magellan subsequently made it possible to identify nearly 900 impact craters. Danilova, Aglaonice and Saskja craters Compared to Mercury, the Moon and other such bodies, Venus has very few craters. In part, this is because Venus's dense atmosphere burns up smaller meteorites before they hit the surface. The Venera and Magellan data are in agreement: there are very few impact craters with a diameter less than , and data from Magellan show an absence of any craters less than in diameter. The small craters are irregular and appear in groups, thus pointing to the deceleration and the breakup of impactors. However, there are also fewer of the large craters, and those appear relatively young; they are rarely filled with lava, showing that they were formed after volcanic activity in the area ceased, and radar data indicates that they are rough and have not had time to be eroded down. Compared to the situation on bodies such as the Moon, it is more difficult to determine the ages of different areas of the surface on Venus, on the basis of crater counts, due to the small number of craters at hand. However, the surface characteristics are consistent with a completely random distribution, implying that the surface of the entire planet is roughly the same age, or at least that very large areas are not very different in age from the average. Taken together, this evidence suggests that the surface of Venus is geologically young. The impact crater distribution appears to be most consistent with models that call for a near-complete resurfacing of the planet. Subsequent to this period of extreme activity, process rates declined and impact craters began to accumulate, with only minor modification and resurfacing since. A young surface all created at the same time is a different situation compared with any of the other terrestrial planets. Global resurfacing event Age estimates based on crater counts indicate a young surface, in contrast to the much older surfaces of Mars, Mercury, and the Moon. For this to be the case on a planet without crustal recycling by plate tectonics requires explanation. One hypothesis is that Venus underwent some sort of global resurfacing about 300-500 million years ago that erased the evidence of older craters. One possible explanation for this event is that it is part of a cyclic process on Venus. On Earth, plate tectonics allows heat to escape from the mantle by advection, the transport of mantle material to the surface and the return of old crust to the mantle. But Venus has no evidence of plate tectonics, so this theory states that the interior of the planet heats up (due to the decay of radioactive elements) until material in the mantle is hot enough to force its way to the surface. The subsequent resurfacing event covers most or all of the planet with lava, until the mantle is cool enough for the process to start over. Volcanoes Radar image of pancake domes in Venus's Eistla region. The two larger ones are approximately wide and rise less than above the surrounding plain. These wide and fairly low, flat-topped volcanoes are a type of landform that is unique to Venus. They were probably formed by extrusions of highly viscous lava that was too sticky to flow very far down-slope from their vents. Computer generated perspective view of pancake domes in Venus's Alpha Regio. The domes in this image average 25 km in diameter. Arachnoid surface feature on Venus The surface of Venus is dominated by volcanism. Although Venus is superficially similar to Earth, it seems that the tectonic plates so active in Earth's geology do not exist on Venus. About 80% of the planet consists of a mosaic of volcanic lava plains, dotted with more than a hundred large isolated shield volcanoes, and many hundreds of smaller volcanoes and volcanic constructs such as coronae. These are geological features believed to be almost unique to Venus: huge, ring-shaped structures 100-300 kilometers (60-180 mi) across and rising hundreds of meters above the surface. The only other place they have been discovered is on Uranus's moon Miranda. It is believed that they are formed when plumes of rising hot material in the mantle push the crust upwards into a dome shape, which then collapses in the centre as the molten lava cools and leaks out at the sides, leaving a crown-like structure: the corona. Differences can be seen in volcanic deposits. In many cases, volcanic activity is localized to a fixed source, and deposits are found in the vicinity of this source. This kind of volcanism is called \\"centralized volcanism,\\" in that volcanoes and other geographic features form distinct regions. The second type of volcanic activity is not radial or centralized; flood basalts cover wide expanses of the surface, similar to features such as the Deccan Traps on Earth. These eruptions result in \\"flow type\\" volcanoes. Volcanoes less than in diameter are very abundant on Venus and they may number hundreds of thousands or even millions. Many appear as flattened domes or 'pancakes', thought to be formed in a similar way to shield volcanoes on Earth. These pancake dome volcanoes are fairly round features that are less than in height and many times that in width. It is common to find groups of hundreds of these volcanoes in areas called shield fields. The domes of Venus are between 10 and 100 times larger than those formed on Earth. They are usually associated with \\"coronae\\" and tesserae. The pancakes are thought to be formed by highly viscous, silica-rich lava erupting under Venus's high atmospheric pressure. Domes called scalloped margin domes (commonly called ticks because they appear as domes with numerous legs), are thought to have undergone mass wasting events such as landslides on their margins. Sometimes deposits of debris can be seen scattered around them. On Venus, volcanoes are mainly of the shield type. Nevertheless, the morphology of the shield volcanoes of Venus is different from shield volcanoes on Earth. On the Earth, shield volcanoes can be a few tens of kilometers wide and up to 10 kilometers high (6.2 mi) in the case of Mauna Kea, measured from the sea floor. On Venus, these volcanoes can cover hundreds of kilometers in area, but they are relatively flat, with an average height of . Other unique features of Venus's surface are novae (radial networks of dikes or grabens) and arachnoids. A nova is formed when large quantities of magma are extruded onto the surface to form radiating ridges and trenches which are highly reflective to radar. These dikes form a symmetrical network around the central point where the lava emerged, where there may also be a depression caused by the collapse of the magma chamber. Arachnoids are so named because they resemble a spider's web, featuring several concentric ovals surrounded by a complex network of radial fractures similar to those of a nova. It is not known whether the 250 or so features identified as arachnoids actually share a common origin, or are the result of different geological processes. Tectonic activity Despite the fact that Venus appears to have no global plate tectonic system as such, the planet's surface shows various features associated with local tectonic activity. Features such as faults, folds, and volcanoes are present there and may be driven largely by processes in the mantle. The active volcanism of Venus has generated chains of folded mountains, rift valleys, and terrain known as tesserae, a word meaning \\"floor tiles\\" in Greek. Tesserae exhibit the effects of eons of compression and tensional deformation. Unlike those on Earth, the deformations on Venus are directly related to regional dynamic forces within the planet's mantle. Gravitational studies suggest that Venus differs from Earth in lacking an asthenosphere--a layer of lower viscosity and mechanical weakness that allows Earth's crustal tectonic plates to move. The apparent absence of this layer on Venus suggests that the deformation of the Venusian surface must be explained by convective movements within the planet's mantle. The tectonic deformations on Venus occur on a variety of scales, the smallest of which are related to linear fractures or faults. In many areas these faults appear as networks of parallel lines. Small, discontinuous mountain crests are found which resemble those on the Moon and Mars. The effects of extensive tectonism are shown by the presence of normal faults, where the crust has sunk in one area relative to the surrounding rock, and superficial fractures. Radar imaging shows that these types of deformation are concentrated in belts located in the equatorial zones and at high southern latitudes. These belts are hundreds of kilometers wide and appear to interconnect across the whole of the planet, forming a global network associated with the distribution of volcanoes. The rifts of Venus, formed by the expansion of the lithosphere, are groups of depressions tens to hundreds of meters wide and extending up to in length. The rifts are mostly associated with large volcanic elevations in the form of domes, such as those at Beta Regio, Atla Regio and the western part of Eistla Regio. These highlands seem to be the result of enormous mantle plumes (rising currents of magma) which have caused elevation, fracturing, faulting, and volcanism. The highest mountain chain on Venus, Maxwell Montes in Ishtar Terra, was formed by processes of compression, expansion, and lateral movement. Another type of geographical feature, found in the lowlands, consists of ridge belts elevated several meters above the surface, hundreds of kilometers wide and thousands of kilometers long. Two major concentrations of these belts exist: one in Lavinia Planitia near the southern pole, and the second adjacent to Atalanta Planitia near the northern pole. Tesserae are found mainly in Aphrodite Terra, Alpha Regio, Tellus Regio and the eastern part of Ishtar Terra (Fortuna Tessera). These regions contain the superimposition and intersection of grabens of different geological units, indicating that these are the oldest parts of the planet. It was once thought that the tesserae were continents associated with tectonic plates like those of the Earth; in reality they are probably the result of floods of basaltic lava forming large plains, which were then subjected to intense tectonic fracturing. Cutaway diagram of possible internal structure Magnetic field and internal structure Venus's crust appears to be thick, and composed of silicate rocks. Venus's mantle is approximately thick, its chemical composition is probably similar to that of chondrites. Since Venus is a terrestrial planet, it is presumed to have a core made of semisolid iron and nickel with a radius of approximately . The unavailability of seismic data from Venus severely limits what can be definitely known about the structure of the planet's mantle, but models of Earth's mantle have been modified to make predictions. It's expected that the uppermost mantle, from about to deep is mostly made of the mineral olivine. Descending through the mantle, the chemical composition remains largely the same but at somewhere between about and , the increasing pressure causes the crystal structure of olivine to change to the more densely packed structure of spinel. Another transition occurs between and deep, where the material takes on the progressively more compact crystal structures of ilmenite and perovskite, and gradually becomes more like perovskite until the core boundary is reached. Venus is similar to Earth in size and density, and so probably also in bulk composition, but it does not have a significant magnetic field. Earth's magnetic field is produced by what is known as the core dynamo, consisting of an electrically conducting liquid, the nickel-iron outer core that rotates and is convecting. Venus is expected to have an electrically conductive core of similar composition, and although its rotation period is very long (243.7 Earth days), simulations show that this is adequate to produce a dynamo. This implies that Venus lacks convection in its outer core. Convection occurs when there is a large difference in temperature between the inner and outer part of the core, but since Venus has no plate tectonics to let off heat from the mantle, it is possible that outer core convection is being suppressed by a warm mantle. It's also possible that Venus may lack a solid inner core for the same reason, if the core is either too hot or is not under enough pressure to allow molten nickel-iron to freeze there. Lava flows and channels Lava originating from Ammavaru caldera (300 km outside the image) overflowed the ridge left of center and pooled to its right. An anastomosing 2-km-wide lava channel in Sedna Planitia Lava flows on Venus are often much larger than Earth's, up to several hundred kilometers long and tens of kilometers wide. It is still unknown why these lava fields or lobate flows reach such sizes, but it is suggested that they are the result of very large eruptions of basaltic, low-viscosity lava spreading out to form wide, flat plains. On Earth, there are two known types of basaltic lava: aa and pƒÅhoehoe. Aa lava presents a rough texture in the shape of broken blocks (clinkers). PƒÅhoehoe lava is recognized by its pillowy or ropy appearance. Rough surfaces appear bright in radar images, which can be used to determine the differences between aa and pƒÅhoehoe lavas. These variations can also reflect differences in lava age and preservation. Channels and lava tubes (channels that have cooled down and over which a dome has formed) are very common on Venus. Two planetary astronomers from the University of Wollongong in Australia, Dr Graeme Melville and Prof. Bill Zealey, researched these lava tubes, using data supplied by NASA, over a number of years and concluded that they were widespread and up to ten times the size of those on the Earth. Melville and Zealey said that the gigantic size of the Venusian lava tubes (tens of meters wide and hundreds of kilometers long) may be explained by the very fluid lava flows together with the high temperatures on Venus, allowing the lava to cool slowly. For the most part, lava flow fields are associated with volcanoes. The central volcanoes are surrounded by extensive flows that form the core of the volcano. They are also related to fissure craters, coronae, dense clusters of volcanic domes, cones, wells and channels. Thanks to Magellan, more than 200 channels and valley complexes have been identified. The channels were classified as simple, complex, or compound. Simple channels are characterized by a single, long main channel. This category includes rills similar to those found on the Moon, and a new type, called canali, consisting of long, distinct channels which maintain their width throughout their entire course. The longest such channel identified (Baltis Vallis) has a length of more than , about one-sixth of the circumference of the planet. Complex channels include anastomosed networks, in addition to distribution networks. This type of channel has been observed in association with several impact craters and important lava floods related to major lava flow fields. Compound channels are made of both simple and complex segments. The largest of these channels shows an anastomosed web and modified hills similar to those present on Mars. Although the shape of these channels is highly suggestive of fluid erosion, there is no evidence that they were formed by water. In fact, there is no evidence of water anywhere on Venus in the last 600 million years. While the most popular theory for the channels' formation is that they are the result of thermal erosion by lava, there are other hypotheses, including that they were formed by heated fluids formed and ejected during impacts. Surface processes =Wind= Liquid water and ice are nonexistent on Venus, and thus the only agent of physical erosion to be found (apart from thermal erosion by lava flows) is wind. Wind tunnel experiments have shown that the density of the atmosphere allows the transport of sediments with even a small breeze.Greeley, R., et. al., Windblown sand on Venus. Icarus 57: 112‚Äì124. 1984.; cited in Therefore, the seeming rarity of eolian land forms must have some other cause.Greeley, R., et. al., Windblown sand on Venus. Icarus 57: 112‚Äì124. 1984.; cited in This implies that transportable sand-size particles are relatively scarce on the planet; which would be a result of very slow rates of mechanical erosion. The process that is most important for the production of sediment on Venus may be crater- forming impact events, which is bolstered by the seeming association between impact craters and downwind eolian land forms.Greeley, R., et al., Aeolian features on Venus: Preliminary Magellan results. Journal of Geophysical Research 97(E8): 13319‚Äì13345. 1992.; cited in Greeley, R., et al., 1995 Wind- related features and processes on Venus: Summary of Magellan results. Icarus 115: 399‚Äì420.; cited in Weitz, CM, in Ford, et. al. (eds). Surface modification processes. In: Guide to Magellan Image Interpretation. Pasadena, CA: NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. NASA-CR-194340 JPL Publication 93-24: 57‚Äì73. 1993.; cited in This process is manifest in the ejecta of impact craters expelled onto the surface of Venus. The material ejected during a meteorite impact is lifted to the atmosphere, where winds transport the material toward the west. As the material is deposited on the surface, it forms parabola-shaped patterns. This type of deposit can be established on top of various geologic features or lava flows. Therefore, these deposits are the youngest structures on the planet. Images from Magellan reveal the existence of more than 60 of these parabola-shaped deposits that are associated with crater impacts. The ejection material, transported by the wind, is responsible for the process of renovation of the surface at speeds, according to the measurements of the Venera soundings, of approximately one metre per second. Given the density of the lower Venusian atmosphere, the winds are more than sufficient to provoke the erosion of the surface and the transportation of fine-grained material. In the regions covered by ejection deposits one may find wind lines, dunes, and yardangs. The wind lines are formed when the wind blows ejection material and volcanic ash, depositing it on top of topographic obstacles such as domes. As a consequence, the leeward sides of domes are exposed to the impact of small grains that remove the surface cap. Such processes expose the material beneath, which has a different roughness, and thus different characteristics under radar, compared to formed sediment. The dunes are formed by the depositing of particulates that are the size of grains of sand and have wavy shapes. Yardangs are formed when the wind-transported material carves the fragile deposits and produces deep furrows. The line- shaped patterns of wind associated with impact craters follow a trajectory in the direction of the equator. This tendency suggests the presence of a system of circulation of Hadley cells between medium latitudes and the equator. Magellan radar data confirm the existence of strong winds that blow toward the east in the upper surface of Venus, and meridional winds on the surface. =Chemical erosion= Chemical and mechanical erosion of the old lava flows is caused by reactions of the surface with the atmosphere in the presence of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide (see carbonate-silicate cycle for details). These two gases are the planet's first and third most abundant gases, respectively; the second most abundant gas is inert nitrogen. The reactions probably include the deterioration of silicates by carbon dioxide to produce carbonates and quartz, as well as the deterioration of silicates by sulfur dioxide to produce anhydrate calcium sulfate and carbon dioxide.  Ancient liquid water  NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and others have postulated that Venus may have had a shallow ocean in the past for up to 2 billion years, with as much water as Earth. Depending on the parameters used in their theoretical model, the last liquid water could have evaporated as recently as 715 million years ago. Currently, the only known water on Venus is in the form of a tiny amount of atmospheric vapor (20 ppm). Hydrogen, a component of water, is still being lost to space nowadays as detected by ESA's Venus Express spacecraft.

Richard Demarco Gallery Demarco was a co-founder of the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh in 1963. Three years later he and other organisers of the theatre's gallery space left the Traverse to establish what became the Richard Demarco Gallery.\\"Focus on Demarco\\" The gallery, which doubled as a performance venue during the Edinburgh Fringe, ran from 1966 to 1992.Senay Boztas, Demarco to get a gallery for his 75th, The Sunday Herald, 6 March 2005. For many years, the Demarco Gallery promoted cultural links with Eastern Europe, both in terms of presenting artists such as Paul Neagu from 1969, Marina Abramoviƒá from 1973 and Neue Slowenische Kunst from 1986 within Scotland, organising exhibitions of contemporary Polish, Romanian and Yugoslav art and in establishing outgoing connections for Scottish artists across Europe. Richard Demarco's involvement with the artist Joseph Beuys led to various presentations, from Strategy Get ArtsPalermo Restore, Strategy: Get Arts , Edinburgh College of Art. in 1970 to Beuys' hunger strike during the Jimmy Boyle Days in 1980. Also particularly notable were the presentations by Tadeusz Kantor's Cricot 2 group during the 1970s and 1980s, including a celebrated unofficial performance of The Water Hen at the former Edinburgh poorhouse during the 1972 Edinburgh Festival.The Top 20 ...Scottish theatre events of all time, The Scotsman, 13 March 2007. Cricot 2 returned to Edinburgh in later years. Demarco introduced Beuys and Kantor to one another and in one performance of Lovelies and Dowdies Beuys performed under Kantor's direction. For many years, after the Scottish Arts Council withdrew its annual grant in 1980 following controversy associated with Joseph Beuys' support for Jimmy Boyle, the Demarco Gallery led a financially straitened existence. Since the early 1990s, Richard Demarco's activity has continued under the auspices of the Demarco European Art Foundation. In November 2008 a substantial selection from Demarco's archives, covering the period 1963‚Äì1980, was made available on-line by the University of Dundee [see below for direct link to online archive]. Images of Demarco's activities during this period, in particular collaborations with Joseph Beuys, Tadeusz Kantor, Paul Neagu and Marina Abramoviƒá are available in the selection from the Demarco archives. Detailed documentation of the Edinburgh Arts journeys from 1972 to 1980 are also available in this selection. Demarco has presented several thousand art exhibitions, plays, music, conferences, and various other performances, mainly in Edinburgh, involving artists from at least sixty countries, including all of central and eastern Europe during the Cold War, North and South America, all countries of western Europe, Australasia, and from Southern Africa, Middle East, and other parts of Asia. Exhibitions and festival programmes were also organised by him and his Demarco European Arts Foundation in other countries including Poland, Lithuania, Croatia, Bosnia, Malta, Georgia, Hungary, Italy to name but a few. His 'Edinburgh Arts' journeys criss-crossed all of Europe, taking artists and academics from other countries alongside those of Scotland to visit interesting people, great collections, cities, landscapes, and events, to examine Europe's cultural history of the past 5,000 years. It is for his consistent internationalism that he was being successfully nominated as European Citizen of the Year 2013. This also followed from his exhibition \\"Scotland in Europe: Europe in Scotland\\" in Brussels in 2011. His own artworks were included in the Italian pavilion of the 2011 Venice Biennale. In 2013 Demarco organised an Italo-Scottish pavilion at the Venice Biennale, his fourth pavilion there. Edinburgh Festival Richard Demarco has attended every Edinburgh Festival and mounted arts programmes in most of them including major art exhibitions for the Edinburgh International Festival, also called the 'official festival'. He has been extensively involved with the Edinburgh Festival Fringe since its inception, while also being highly critical of it in recent decades for delivering too much shallow entertainment in what is the largest arts festival in the world with over 3,500 productions and 40,000 performances every August. Over the years he has put on a wide variety of challenging theatre productions, art exhibitions and other cultural events. Many of the artists, actors, directors, musicians, film makers who first appeared outside their home countries at his Edinburgh festival venues subsequently became world-renowned such as Tadeusz Kantor, Yvette Bozsik, and Marina Abramoviƒá. The gallery venue was never run for profit; many performers were allowed to put on productions or exhibit at little or no cost. And Demarco himself has been no stranger to artistic and commercial risks. For instance, in 1995, his venue hosted a group of artists flown out from the then besieged city of Sarajevo alongside an opera installation by the young Damien Hirst. During the Cold War Demarco crossed the Iron Curtain 100 times bringing hundreds of artists and arts groups out of Central and Eastern Europe to perform at the Edinburgh Festival. His programs of more than 1,000 art exhibitions and several thousand performing arts productions, and have included artists from more than 60 countries. His ethos is to remain faithful to the founding principle of the Edinburgh Festival, which is to heal the wounds of war through the languages of the arts. Demarco is one of the most widely recognised and best loved arts figures in Scotland and far beyond. No stranger to media controversy, Demarco has challenged successive Fringe organisers' boundaries by staging festival productions outside Edinburgh. These have included a full costume, full length production of Shakespeare's Macbeth staged on Inchcolm Island in the Firth of Forth.Shows that put fringe on cultural map of Britain, Times Online, 12 June 2005 . Always a controversial figure, not least in constantly emphasising the importance of recalling festival history and high art values however avant-garde, his approach has not always sat easily with the Scottish arts establishment as the Fringe has become increasingly driven by commercial considerations that led to over-dominance of the Comedy Festival in the Edinburgh fringe. From 1999, Demarco's involvement at the Fringe was in collaboration with Rocket Venues founder Xela Batchelder, as Demarco-Rocket Productions. In 2003, Rocket Venues took over the Roxy (also sometimes known as the Demarco Roxy) Art House, a converted church on the corner of Roxburgh Place and Drummond Street on the South Side of Edinburgh, previously used by the Pleasance Theatre (Pleasance Over-the-Road). In 2008 the building was sold to another organisation, who doubled the rent and subsequently left Rocket Venues without a home. Richard Demarco and Xela Batchelder (now a full-time Associate Professor) still collaborate on educational and festival type projects, but on a smaller scale. Since the 2011 festival, moving from Craigcrook Castle, Demarco's new home for his archives, exhibitions, theatre and other events is Summerhall at the East end of The Meadows, Edinburgh Southside, Europe's largest private multi-arts centre where 1,300 productions including over 100 art shows are staged annually. Summerhall was for a century the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies until purchased from Edinburgh University in November 2011 by buyers closely associated with Demarco over many years. The veterinary school moved to a new campus outside the city at Easter Bush. Writing Demarco was a regular contributor to ArtReview, then titled Arts Review throughout the 1980s. Honours and awards Previously appointed as an OBE, he was raised to a CBE in the New Year Honours List in December 2006. In 1976, Richard Demarco received a Gold Medal from the Polish government and in 1986, he was made a Cavaliere of the Italian Republic. In 1992 he received the Witkacy Prize. In 2012 he received gold medals simultaneously from both Germany and Poland following a major retrospective entitled Ten Dialogues at the Royal Scottish Academy. Later in the same year he received a gold medal from Romania and another from the Culture Minister of Poland in Warsaw. He has been awarded honorary doctorates by universities in Europe and North America and, from 1993 to 2000, he was Professor of European Culture at the University of Kingston. He received the European Citizen's Medal on Monday 19 August 2013, in a ceremony held at the European Parliament Office, Brussels, the only UK citizen and only arts person receiving this honour. Also, in 2013, Demarco was featured in an episode of the BBC's The Culture Show hosted by Sue Perkins. The episode celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Traverse Theatre. On Monday 24 March 2014, Demarco received an engraved Loving Cup from Edinburgh City Council presented by the Lord Provost in the City Chambers. At the ceremony, Ron Butlin, the Edinburgh Makar, recited a poem commissioned especially for the occasion. An impression of Demarco's handprints has been immortalised on a flagstone in the City Chambers quadrangle alongside previous Edinburgh Award recipients Ian Rankin, JK Rowling, George Kerr, Sir Chris Hoy, Professor Peter Higgs and Elizabeth Blackadder.

It is often used as an argument against the rational value of scientific thought. The argument is as follows: #There are an infinite number of possible theories, #There can only be a finite amount of experimental evidence, #Therefore, it is impossible to disambiguate between all viable theories. While this is true in this abstract form, in practice, parsimony is used to limit the number of theories which are considered useful, and likewise, to limit the number of directions to take experimental research. Occam's Razor, seeking the simplest explanation, forms much of the basis of modern scientific thought; a theory which accounts best for all observed phenomena, does not predict disproven phenomena, and does not introduce unobserved phenomena is to be preferred. Moreover, data obtained by one experiment can be applied to more than one hypothesis, and proven hypotheses can be applied to more than one theory. For example, the theory of gravity has implications for innumerable other theories. There is not an infinite number of possible theories, since the available theories are limited by the ideas which have actually been imagined by scientists.

Mainly among Poles, it was sometimes known acronymically as Hakata or H-K-T after its founders von Hansemann, Kennemann and von Tiedemann. Its main aims were the promotion of Germanization of Poles living in Prussia and destruction of Polish national identity in German eastern provinces. Contrary to many similar nationalist organizations created in that period, the Ostmarkenverein had relatively close ties with the government and local administration, which made it largely successful, even though it opposed both the policy of seeking some modo vivendi with the Poles pursued by Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg and Leo von Caprivi's policies of relaxation of anti-Polish measures. While of limited significance and often overrated, the organization formed a notable part of German anti- democratic pluralist part of the political landscape of the Wilhelmine era. Initially formed in Posen, in 1896 its main headquarters was moved to Berlin. In 1901 it had roughly 21,000 members, the number rose to 48,000 in 1913, though some authors claim the membership was as high as 220,000. After Poland was re-established following World War I in 1918, the society continued its rump activities in the Weimar Republic until it was closed down by the Nazis in 1934 who created the new organisation with similar activity Bund Deutscher Osten.  Background  German 1905 map showing the extent of the Polish- speaking majority in Greater Poland Following the Partitions of Poland in late 18th century, a large part of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (namely the regions of Greater Poland and Royal, the later West Prussia) was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, the predecessor of the German Empire, which was formed in 1871. Primarily inhabited by Poles, Greater Poland initially was formed into a semi-autonomous Grand Duchy of Posen, granted with a certain level of self-governance. However, under Otto von Bismarck's government, the ethnic and cultural tensions in the region began to rise. This was paired by growing tendencies of nationalism, imperialism, and chauvinism within the German society. The tendencies went in two different directions, but were linked to each other. On one hand, a new world order was demanded with desires of creating a German colonial empire. And on the other, feelings of hostility towards other national groups within the German state were growing. The situation was further aggravated by Bismarck's policies of Kulturkampf that in Posen Province took on a much more nationalistic character than in other parts of Germany and included a number of specifically anti-Polish laws that resulted in the Polish and German communities living in a virtual apartheid.Martin Kitchen, op.cit., p.130 Many observers believed these policies only further stoked the Polish independence movement. There is also a question regarding possible personal antipathy towards Poles behind Bismarck's motivation in pursuing the Kulturkampf. Unlike in other parts of the German Empire, in Greater Poland--then known under the German name of Provinz Posen-- the Kulturkampf did not cease after the end of the decade. Although Bismarck finally signed an informal alliance with the Catholic Church against the socialists, the policies of Germanization did continue in Polish-inhabited parts of the country. However, with the end of von Bismarck's rule and the advent of Leo von Caprivi, the pressure for Germanisation was lessened and many German landowners feared that this would lead to lessening the German control over the Polish areas and in the end deprive Germany of what they saw as a natural reservoir of workforce and land. Although the actual extent of von Caprivi's concessions towards the Poles was very limited, the German minority of Greater Poland feared that this was a step too far, and that von Caprivi's government would cede the power in Greater Poland to the Polish clergy and nobility. The Hakata slogan was: \\"You are standing opposite to the most dangerous, fanatic enemy of German existence, German honour and German reputation in the world: The Poles.\\" Society  Under such circumstances a number of nationalist organizations and pressure groups was formed, all collectively known as the nationale Verb√§nde. Among them were the Pan-German League, German Navy League, German Colonial Society, German Anti-Semitic Organization, and the Defence League.Geoff Eley, op.cit., p.VII Many landowners feared that their interests would not be properly represented by those organizations and decided to form their own society. It was officially launched November 3, 1894 in Pozna≈Ñ, then referred to under its German name of Posen. The opening meeting elected an assembly and a general committee composed of 227 members, among them 104 from the Province of Posen and Province of West Prussia, and additional 113 from other parts of German Empire. The social base of the newly founded society was wide and included a large spectrum of people. Some 60% of the representatives of areas of Germany primarily inhabited by Poles were the Junkers, the landed aristocracy, mostly with ancient feudal roots. The rest were all groups of middle class Germans, that is civil servants (30%), teachers (25%), merchants, craftsmen, Protestant priests, and clerks. The official aims of the society was \\"strengthening and rallying of Germandom in the Eastern Marches through the revival and consolidation of German national feeling and the economic strengthening of the German people\\" in the area. This was seen as justified due to alleged passivity of Germans in the eastern territories. Officially it was to work for the Germans rather than against the Poles. However, in reality the aims of the society were anti-Polish and aimed at ousting the Polish landowners and peasants from their land at all cost. It was argued that the Poles were an insidious threat to German national and cultural integrity and domination in the east. The propagandistic rationale behind formation of the H-K-T was presented as a national Polish-German struggle to assimilate one group into the other. It was argued that either the Poles would be successfully Germanized, or the Germans living in the east would face the Polonization themselves. This conflict was often portrayed as a constant biological struggle between the \\"eastern barbarity\\" and \\"European culture\\". To counter the alleged threat, the Society promoted the destruction of Polish national identity in the Polish lands held by Germany, and prevention of polonization of the Eastern Marches, that is the growing national sentiment amongst local Poles paired with migration of Poles from rural areas to the cities of the region. In accordance with the views of Chancellor von Bismarck himself, the Society saw the language question as a key factor in determining one's loyalty towards the state. Because of this view, it insisted on extending the ban on usage of the Polish language in schools, to other instances of everyday life, including public meetings, books, and newspapers. During a 1902 meeting in Danzig (modern Gda≈Ñsk), the Society demanded from the government that the Polish language be banned even from voluntary classes in schools and universities, that the language be banned from public usage and that the Polish language newspapers be either liquidated or forced to be printed in bilingual versions. With limited local success and support, the Ostmarkenverein functioned primarily as a nationwide propaganda and pressure group. Its press organ, the Die Ostmark (Eastern March) was one of the primary sources of information on the Polish Question for the German public and shaped the national-conservative views towards the ethnic conflict in the eastern territories of Germany. The Society also opened a number of libraries in the Polish-dominated areas, where it supported the literary production of books and novels promoting an aggressive stance against the Poles. The popular Ostmarkenromane (Ostmark novels) depicted Poles as non-white and struggled to portray a two race dichotomy between \\"black\\" Poles and \\"white\\" GermansGermany's colonial pasts Eric Ames, Marcia Klotz, Lora Wildenthal, page 84-86, University of Nebraska Press 2005 However, it did not limit itself to mere cultural struggle for domination but also promoted a physical removal of the Poles from their lands in order to make space for the German colonization. The pressure of the H-K-T indeed made the government of von Caprivi adopt a firmer stance against the Poles. The ban on Polish schools was reintroduced and all teaching was to be done in German language. The ban was also used by the German police to harass the Polish trade union movement as they interpreted all public meetings as educational undertakings. An important issue was the colonisation of Polish territory: the organisation actively supported the nationalist policy of Germanisation through removal of Polish population and promoting settlement of ethnic Germans in the eastern regions of the German Empire. It was among the main supporters of creation of the Settlement Commission, an official authority with a fund to buy up the land from the Poles and redistribute it among German settlers. Since 1905 the organisation also proposed and lobbied for a law that would allow forced eviction of Polish owners of land, and succeed in 1908 when the law was eventually passed. However, it remained on paper in the following years, to which the H-K-T responded with large scale propaganda campaign in the press. The campaign proved to be successful and on October 12, 1912 the Prussian government issued a decision allowing eviction of Polish property owners in Greater Poland.  Social base  Although the H-K-T is to this day primarily associated with the Junkers, it was one of the groups to oppose the Society's goals the most. Initially treated with reserve by most of the conservative Prussian aristocracy, with time it became actively opposed by many of them. The Society opposed any immigration of Poles from the Russian Poland to the area, while the Junkers gained large profits from seasonal workers migrating there every year, mostly from other parts of Poland. Also the German colonists brought to formerly Polish lands by the Settlement Commission or the German government largely benefited from the cooperation with their Polish neighbours and mostly either ignored the Hakatisten or even actively opposed their ideas. This made the Ostmarkenverein an organization formed mostly by the German bourgeoisie and settlers, that is middle class members of the local administration, and not the Prussian Junkers. Other notable group of supporters included the local artisans and businessmen, whose interests were endangered by the organic work, that is the Polish response to the economical competition promoted by the Settlement Commission and other similar organizations. In a sample probe of H-K-T's members, the social classes represented were as follows: * 26.6% of civil servants and members of German administration * 17.6% of artisans * 15.7% of businessmen * 14.0% of teachers * 10.7% of landowners * 4.2% of clergymen * 2.7% of army officers * 0.7% of rentiers * 6.5% of other professions * 1.3% of people with no designation  Effects and after-life  = In Poland = By 1913 the Society had roughly 48,000 members. Despite its fierce rhetoric, support from the local administration and certain popularity of its goals, the Society proved to be largely unsuccessful as were the projects it promoted. Much like other similar organizations, the H-K-T not only managed to incite some public awareness to the Polish Question within German public and radicalise the German policies in the area, but also sparked a Polish reaction. As an effect of the external pressure, the Poles living in the German Empire started to organize themselves in order to prevent the plans of Germanisation. In addition, the main opposition centre on the Polish side became the middle class rather than aristocracy, which strengthened the Polish resistance and intensified the national sentiment within the Polish society. Also, the pressure from the German nationalists resulted in strengthening the Polish national-democrats, particularly the Polish National-Democratic Party of Roman Dmowski, and Wojciech Korfanty. For instance, the Settlement Commission throughout the 27 years of its existence managed to plant about 25,000 German families on 1,240 km¬≤ (479 mi¬≤) of land in Greater Poland and Pomerania. However, at the same time the reaction of Polish societies resulted in about 35,000 new Polish farmers being settled in the area of roughly 1,500 km¬≤ (579 mi¬≤) of land.Keith Bullivant, op.cit., pp.52-53 Similarly, the attempts at banning the teaching of religion in Polish language met with a nationwide resistance and several school strikes that sparked a campaign in foreign media. = In Germany = All in all, even though the H-K-T Society was not the most influential and its exact influence on the German governments is disputable, it was among the best-heard and for the Polish people became one of the symbols of oppression, chauvinism, and national discrimination, thus poisoning the Polish-German relations both in the borderland and in entire Germany. On the eve of World War I the nationalisms on both sides ran high and the liberal politicians who were seeking some compromise with the German Empire were seen as traitors, while German politicians trying to tone down the aggressive rhetoric on both sides were under attack from the Hakatisten. This situation proved vital to the failure of German plans of creation of Mitteleuropa during the Great War, as the Polish political scene was taken over mostly by politicians hostile to Germany. = Post-war organisation = The works of the Ostmarkenverein practically ceased during the war. At its end, some of its members joined the Deutsche Vereinigung (German Association), a society that aimed at preventing newly restored Poland from acquiring the lands that were formerly in Prussia. Many more of its members feared possible Polish reprisals after the take-over of Greater Poland, Pomerania and Silesia, and were among the first to pack their belongings and head westwards after the armistice, while others stayed in the lands that were taken over by Poland, protected by the Minority Treaty. Even though the Ostmarkenverein had lost its main rationale as Germany had no influence over the lands of the Republic of Poland, it continued to exist in a rump form. Headed from Berlin, it tried to force the government of the Weimar Republic to use the threat of reprisals against the remaining Polish minority in Germany in order to win further concessions for the German minority in Poland.Richard Blanke, op.cit., pp.138-139 However, the post-war government of Gustav Stresemann mostly rejected the pleas as there were many more Germans in Poland than Poles in Germany, and such a tit-for-tat tactics would harm the German side more. The Society continued to exist in Berlin, limiting its activities mostly to a press campaign and rhetoric, but its meaning was seriously limited. Finally, after the advent of Adolf Hitler's rule in Germany, it was disbanded by the Nazis. Some of its former members, now living in Poland, remained members of other German societies and organizations, and formed the core of the German Fifth column during the German Invasion of Poland of 1939.

The team struggled in the first class matches, where they drew two and lost three matches, and only looked like having a chance of winning in the last match against Kent. The one-day series went slightly better, with Bangladesh A winning two, losing one and abandoning a fourth, but for a second string national team against mainly second elevens from English domestic cricket, it was a highly disappointing tour.  Match details  =British Universities v Bangladesh A (18 July)= British Universities beat Bangladesh A by two wickets In a twelve-a-side match at The Parks, Oxford, a strong Bangladesh A side including nine internationals went down to a combined universities side, admittedly including two current county professionals. Bangladesh A batted first, and made 249 for 6 in their 50 overs, Nafees Iqbal top-scoring with 109, while young prodigy Mushfiqur Rahim also made 50. Bangladesh A proceeded to gift away 35 extras - including 21 in wides - which probably cost them the match, as the Universities passed their score with ten balls remaining. Talha Jubair and Abdur Razzak showed promising things with the ball, though, taking four for 50 and two for 37 respectively. (Cricinfo scorecard) =Gloucestershire v Bangladesh A (20-22 July)= Gloucestershire won by 130 runs Bangladesh A, still without a win on tour of England, shocked Gloucestershire initially at Bristol. Shahadat Hossain took three wickets for the tourists, and Syed Rasel and Talha Jubair also chipped in, as Gloucestershire imploded to 72 for 7. However, 83 from wicketkeeper Stephen Snell lifted them to 232, before Jon Lewis and James Averis dug into the tourists to reduce them to 29 for 3. However, Tushar Imran played his way to his fourth first-class century, a career-best 119, to give the tourists a slender lead of 19 after a 122-run fourth-wicket stand between Tushar and Alok Kapali. However, Gloucestershire were determined to prove their class the second time around, and after losing Kadeer Ali for 1 after half an hour they were in control, batting their way to 330 for 5 in just 65.1 overs before declaring as Alex Gidman recorded a 94-ball century. Sri Lankan overseas player Malinga Bandara then took five for 45 with his leg-spin as the tourists imploded from 106 for 2 to 181 all out. (Cricinfo scorecard) =Hampshire v Bangladesh A (24 July)= Match abandoned without a ball bowled Rain at Rose Bowl, Southampton prevented Bangladesh A from playing their third scheduled match on their tour of England, against Hampshire. (Cricinfo scorecard) =Glamorgan v Bangladesh A (26-28 July)= Match drawn After a first day where Glamorgan had racked up 380 runs, Michael Powell top-scoring with 111 and Alex Wharf making 77 while Syed Rasel took four for 89, the touring Bangladesh A side were sent in to bat. Only 10.1 overs of play was possible on the second day, though, and Andrew Davies took two wickets while Alex Wharf was taken for 36 runs off just five overs. Day three was rained out, so the match at Abergavenny ended in a tame draw, with Bangladesh A finishing on 54 for 2. (Cricinfo scorecard) =Lancashire v Bangladesh A (1 August)= Bangladesh A won by seven wickets (D/L Method) Lancashire put out a second-string side against Bangladesh A, admittedly including former ODI bowler Sajid Mahmood, and were duly punished by the tourists, who cruised to a seven-wicket victory. Having won the toss, the Bangladeshis chose to bowl at Lancashire, and after Andrew Crook and Iain Sutcliffe had put on 35 for the first wicket, Shahadat Hossain dug out two quick wickets. Lancashire recovered somewhat before rain stopped play for nearly two hours, but when the players returned, Abdur Razzak ran through the middle order. He took three wickets for 25, and Lancashire collapsed to 149, with two run outs. Bangladesh were set 152 to win due to the rain interruption, and the tourists scored slowly before Tushar Imran came to the crease. Tushar took 91 balls to forge 93 runs, his sixth one-day fifty, as he guided Bangladesh A to a total of 155 for 3 with more than 15 overs remaining in the match. (Cricinfo scorecard) =Yorkshire v Bangladesh A (3-5 August)= Yorkshire won by 126 runs A second-string Yorkshire pummeled the Bangladeshi bowlers, and despite the short timeframe - three days instead of the County Championship's four - they still got a win. With a run-rate of more than four an over they quickly made their way to 357 for 2 on the first day - Matthew Wood made an unbeaten 202, five short of his career highest score, and shared an opening partnership worth 272 with Joe Sayers. In reply, Tushar Imran made his second first-class century on tour, and the fifth of his career, with 116 in a little over three hours, and 19-year-old Nazimuddin made 60 as the tourists made their way to 325 - left- armer David Lucas taking five for 49. Yorkshire lost two wickets before stumps to be 48 for 2, but Michael Lumb made a century on the final day to ensure continued Yorkshire domination as they declared on 240 for 2, setting Bangladesh a target of 273 in three and a half hours. Lucas continued on his fine form from the first innings, taking three wickets, and no Bangladeshi passed 30 as they succumbed for 146 - Lucas took three for 35, fellow left- armer David Wainwright took three for 22 with his spin, and even part-time medium-pacer Richard Pyrah got one wicket in his two overs. (Cricinfo scorecard) =Durham v Bangladesh A (7 August)= Bangladesh A won by 68 runs 147 from Shahriar Nafees and Nazimuddin's seven-ball 28 - which included three sixes, two fours and a two before he was caught and bowled off Ben Harmison - lifted Bangladesh A to a massive 299 for 6 in 50 overs, despite Neil Killeen removing Tushar Imran and Alok Kapali with successive balls mid-innings. Nafees had paired up with Mehrab Hossain for 209 for the first wicket. Durham started with a 40-run opening partnership, but Syed Rasel and Shahadat Hossain both took two wickets with successive balls, separated by a few overs. Shahadat went on to take four for 34, while Australian Callum Thorp top-scored with 52 - in vain, as Durham imploded to 213. Durham's captain and opener Lowe ground out 36 runs from 80 deliveries to halt Durham's chase severely. (Cricinfo scorecard) =Surrey v Bangladesh A (10-12 August)= Match drawn A Surrey team including two former internationals - England batsman Mark Butcher returning from injury, and the retiring Pakistani spin bowler Saqlain Mushtaq - amassed 336 for 5 before declaring after 74 overs at The Oval. The internationals made little impact in the first innings, however, as Butcher was caught for 5 and Saqlain did not bat. James Benning slashed 22 boundaries in his 124 before being run out, and wicketkeeper Andrew Hodd made an unbeaten 50 in his first first-class game. Bangladesh A battled well in reply, equalling Surrey's score before they were bowled out, while Saqlain got three for 82. Tushar Imran continued on his rich vein of form, making 70 and top- scoring. Scott Newman and Richard Clinton led Surrey to 73 without loss, but two quick wickets from Talha Jubair turned the game slightly. Mark Butcher repaired his first innings failure, however, as he made 90 to lead Surrey to 332 for 6 before they declared again. Jubair got four for 99 from an expensive 19 overs. However, the task of surviving 24 overs was easy enough for the tourists, who only lost one wicket, that of Shahriar Nafees who made a quickfire 63. (Cricinfo scorecard) =Kent v Bangladesh A (16-17 August)= Kent won by three wickets Eighteen wickets fell on the frantic first day at St Lawrence Ground, and nineteen on the second, as two teams clashed in an interesting, low scoring match that lasted for only 173.4 overs. The Bangladesh A tourists had won the coin toss and chosen to bat, but immediately lost Nafees Iqbal for a duck. However, Tushar Imran made 86, and with some help from Shahriar Nafees (with 30) and Nazimuddin (27), he took the score to 185. That total did not look challenging, but that was before Syed Rasel's medium pace came to the scene. After Niall O'Brien and Neil Dexter put on 13 for the first wicket for Kent, Rasel and Shahadat Hossain dug out two wickets each, as Kent lost four wickets for two runs. Rasel took three more wickets before stumps on day one, and two more on the second morning, to end with seven for 50 - the only five-wicket-haul of Bangladesh A on the tour. However, only Shahriar Nafees passed 20 in the second innings, Tushar lost his golden touch (before this innings, he had made 455 runs at a batting average of 65) to only scamper 12 runs, while Antiguan-born Robbie Joseph took five for 19 with his pace bowling. Kent were set 188 to win, and lost wickets at regular intervals, but 54 from the first-class debutant Dexter turned out to be crucial as Kent made it with three wickets to spare.

She is best known for her roles in horror films during the 1950s and early 1960s. Early life Court was born in Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire. Her father, G.W. Court, a cricketer who played for Durham CCC. She attended Boldmere School and Highclare College, and later studied drama at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and the Alexandra Theatre. Career At the age of sixteen, Court met film director Anthony Asquith in London; the meeting gained her a brief part in Champagne Charlie (1944). Court won a British Critics Award for her role as a crippled girl in Carnival (1946) and also appeared in Holiday Camp (1947) and Bond Street (1948). Her first role in a fantasy film was in Ghost Ship (1952). Devil Girl from Mars (1954) was a low-budget film produced by the Danziger Brothers. Court trained at the Rank Organisation's \\"charm school\\". She wanted to act in comedy films but also continued to appear in horror films and, in 1957, had what was to become a career-defining role in the first colour Hammer Horror film The Curse of Frankenstein (1957). In the 1957‚Äì58 television season, she co-starred in a CBS sitcom filmed in England, Dick and the Duchess, in the role of Jane Starrett, a patrician Englishwoman married to an American insurance claims investigator living in London, a role played by Patrick O'Neal.Terrace, Vincent (2011). Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010. McFarland & Company, Inc. . P. 258. Court travelled back and forth between Hollywood and England, appearing in four episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents. She had parts in A Woman of Mystery (1958), The Man Who Could Cheat Death (1959) and Doctor Blood's Coffin (1961) among others. By the early 1960s, Court had moved to the United States permanently. She was featured in the Edgar Allan Poe horror films The Premature Burial (1962) with Ray Milland, The Raven (1963) with Peter Lorre and Boris Karloff and The Masque of the Red Death (1964), the last two with Vincent Price. She appeared on occasion in the early 1960s TV anthology series, The Dick Powell Show (aka, The Dick Powell Theatre) and an entry in the British film series, the Edgar Wallace Mysteries (US: The Edgar Wallace Mystery Theatre) \\"The Man Who Was Nobody\\" (1960). Court also appeared in episodes of several TV series, including Adventures in Paradise, Mission: Impossible, Bonanza, Dr. Kildare, Danger Man, Twelve O'Clock High, Burke's Law with Gene Barry, Sam Benedict starring Edmond O'Brien, Gidget with Sally Field, McMillan and Wife with Rock Hudson, Mannix, The Wild Wild West, Thriller hosted by Boris Karloff, Rawhide (\\"Incident of the Dowry Dundee\\") with Clint Eastwood, and in \\"The Fear\\", the penultimate episode of the original 1959-1964 The Twilight Zone hosted by Rod Serling. Court appeared briefly in Omen III: The Final Conflict (uncredited, 1981). In addition to acting, she was also a painter and sculptress, and studied sculpting in Italy. Personal life Court was married to actor Dermot Walsh from 1949 until 1963. They had a daughter, Sally Walsh, who appeared with her mother in The Curse of Frankenstein. In 1964, Court married actor and director Don Taylor, whom she met while they were shooting an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents. They had two children.  Death  Court died of a heart attack at her home near Lake Tahoe, California, on 15 April 2008, aged 82.

Geography The palace lies at the northern end of the Thimphu Valley, on the west bank of the Thimphu River. The palace is accessed via the Dechhen Lam (road) which runs along the eastern bank of the Thimphu river from the district of Yangchenphug, through Langjupakha for several kilometres before approaching the palace. On the way to the palace the road passes the Royal Banquet Hall, the Centre for Bhutan Studies, the Woodcraft Centre and then passes the Indian Estate on the other side of the river.Pommaret, p.162 Just south of the palace on the other side of the river is the suburb of Taba. The palace is surrounded by forest to the east and west; the eastern forest is denser and is said to be the only leafy forest in the city. Opposite on a slope in the forest high above Taba is the Wangchuck Resort, used as a meditation retreat (the retreat has no connection to the palace).Pommaret, p.178 History Dechencholing Palace was built in 1953 after the coronation of the third King of Bhutan, Druk Gyalpo Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, following the death of his father, Druk Gyalpo Jigme Wangchuck, in 1952. The third king's son Jigme Singye Wangchuck was born here on 11 November 1955. Later, one hundred thousand Raksha Thotreng rituals were performed at the palace as a beneficial rite for the public enthronement of the Jigme Singye Wangchuck in 1974. The late Royal Grandmother, Druk Gyalpo‚Äôs mother the Dowager Queen Phuntsho Choden (Ashi Phuntsho Choden), popularly known as Gayum Angay Phuntsho Choden Wangchuck, lived in this palace as a Buddhist nun. However, the present King does not stay in this palace, as the royal residence is now at the Samteling Palace (Royal Cottage).Brown, p. 97Palin, p. 245 The palace is frequently used for international delegations, especially those with India. Indian ambassadors regularly visit the palace to discuss international relations between India and Bhutan. It is also the venue for hosting luncheons and banquets for Head of the States and other important guests of Bhutan. Structure The palace is a three-storied building set amidst willow trees, lawns and ponds. Except for the present King, other members of the Royal family reside here. Its architecture is entirely in Bhutanese traditional style including the furnishings inside. The palace interior furnishings are said to be encased in metal in repouss√© technique superimposed on white velvet. The late Royal Grandmother, Gayum Phuntsho Choden Wangchuck lived in this palace for many years and possessed her own chapel, adorned with paintings and carvings and candles burning from bowls. Gayum employed a number of women at the palace to weave garments for men and women, producing national dress costumes. As the palace frequently hosts international delegations, it has its own helipad to facilitate swift access even though there is no airport in Thimphu. In 1957, King Jigme Wangchuck commissioned a skilled artist named Lam Durlop Dorji of Bumthang to open an embroidery school at the palace, to instruct some 30 young monks in this field. The school has produced several notable thangka embroideries, notably Thongdrel (large thangkas hanging from the roof tops of monasteries and dzongs), and Thangkas (scroll paintings). As Bhutan is a Tibetan Buddhist nation this school heavily revolves around Buddhism, which is reflected in its artwork.

It has around 5,300 inhabitants. The well-preserved medieval town built above important gold mines is the site of the oldest still-working mint in the world. Name The name is derived from Slovak kreme≈à, kremenina (quartz) with a feminine suffix -ica, functioning to create local names.Martin ≈†tef√°nik - J√°n Lukaƒçka et al. 2010, Lexik√≥n stredovek√Ωch miest na Slovensku, Historick√Ω √∫stav SAV, Bratislava, 2010, pp. 503, 360, . http://forumhistoriae.sk/-/lexikon-stredovekych-miest- na-slovensku History Kremnica was among the major mining towns of the world during the Middle Ages and in the modern era due to the abundant gold ore deposits in the Kremnica Mountains. However, the first evidence of sub- surface mining activities comes from the 9th century. In the 13th century the inhabitants of this area were affected by the invasion of the Mongols. Following that difficult period, Hungarian kings invited new colonists from Germany to settle in the region to help replenish the decimated population. Their innovative technology and knowledge restored the mining activities in the town. The first written reference to the town dates back to 1328, when it was granted royal town privileges by King Charles I of Hungary. The town's mint was already in existence at the time of the granting of royal privileges. Starting in 1335 the mint produced golden florins and later the famous \\"Kremnica ducats\\", which were used as an international means of payment as a result of their consistently high purity of gold. It was the most important mint, and later the only one, in the Kingdom of Hungary, in Czechoslovakia and nowadays in Slovakia; the prosperity brought to the town led to it being given the nickname \\"Golden Kremnica\\". In 1331, Kremnica became the seat of the Chamber Count (Kammergraf) who was the head of the most important mining and minting chamber of the Kingdom of Hungary. The Count administered all the mines and mints in twelve counties of the kingdom in the Middle Ages. At the end of the 14th century, Kremnica became the capital of the mining towns in central Upper Hungary. The steady annual production of gold and silver guaranteed the prosperous development of the town. In the 15th century Kreminca was the second most important city in the Kingdom of Hungary. The town was continuously being granted new privileges and the deputies of the town occupied the second place in the Hungarian Diet (the first place was reserved for the representatives of Buda, the capital of the Kingdom). Gold mining and coin production in Kremnica culminated in the 14th and 15th centuries. As one of the most important centers of Protestant Reformation in the country, the town belonged to the Protestant \\"League of Seven Mining Towns\\" together with Bansk√° Bel√°, Bansk√° Bystrica, Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica, ƒΩubietov√°, Nov√° Ba≈àa, and Pukanec. In the 16th century, the town was a major centre of production of (mostly religious) medals, especially by Joachim Deschler. At the same time however, the miners had to dig deeper and deeper to reach new deposits and the mining conditions deteriorated because of underground water in the shafts. The cost of mining increased and the mining was becoming less profitable. The last gold was extracted in Kremnica in 1970, at which time all the mines were closed. The German population of the town and its surroundings was expelled in 1945 as the conequential punishment by former Czechoslovak government after the World War II. Geography Kremnica lies at an altitude of above sea level and covers an area of . It is located in the Kremnica Mountains on the brook Kremnick√Ω potok, which is a tributary of the Hron River. It is located around west of Bansk√° Bystrica (by line), south of Martin and around from Bratislava. Main sights Plague column on main square. The castle built in the 13th through 15th centuries towers over the town. In the first half of the 14th century, it became the residence of the Chamber Count. The town was immediately fortified with a double wall containing several bastions and towers. The castle represents a unique example of a very well preserved fortification system in Central Europe. In the 14th century, it developed into a multifunctional complex of buildings and thus became the centre of local administration, religious life, and defense. At the end of the 15th century, the Chamber Count moved to a newly built house with a unique diamond vault. Thereafter the residence of the Count in the castle was converted into the St. Catherine's Church. Other sites of interest also include the Museum of Coins and Medals, the Museum of Skiing and a historical main square with a monumental Baroque plague column. The Gothic Church of St. Catherine hosts the popular European Organ Festival. A 20-km long aqueduct, built in the 15th century, is still working, supplying three hydroelectric power plants (one of them located 245 m below the ground). Forested mountains around the town offer plenty of opportunities for hiking and cross-country skiing. The geographical centre of Europe is claimed to be in the nearby village of Krahule. Demographics Kremnica has a population of 5,528 (as of December 31, 2013). According to the 2001 census, 95.8% of inhabitants were Slovaks and 1.2% Germans. However, even among those identifying themselves as Slovaks many are descendants of the Carpathian Germans, who played a very important role in the medieval history of the town. The religious makeup was 64.9% Roman Catholics, 22.6% people with no religious affiliation, and 5.8% Lutherans.

In mathematics, it is used to describe the velocity of a propagating front in the solution of hyperbolic partial differential equation.  Various velocities  Associated with propagation of a disturbance are several different velocities. For definiteness, consider an amplitude modulated electromagnetic carrier wave. The phase velocity is the speed of the underlying carrier wave. The group velocity is the speed of the modulation or envelope. Initially it was thought that the group velocity coincided with the speed at which information traveled. However, it turns out that this speed can exceed the speed of light in some circumstances, causing confusion by an apparent conflict with the theory of relativity. That observation led to consideration of what constitutes a signal. By definition, a signal involves new information or an element of 'surprise' that cannot be predicted from the wave motion at an earlier time. One possible form for a signal (at the point of emission) is: :f(t) = u(t) \\\\sin \\\\omega t \\\\ , where u(t) is the Heaviside step function. Using such a form for a signal, it can be shown, subject to the (expected) condition that the refractive index of any medium tends to one as the frequency tends to infinity, that the wave discontinuity, called the front, propagates at a speed less than or equal to the speed of light c in any medium. In fact, the earliest appearance of the front of an electromagnetic disturbance (the precursor) travels at the front velocity, which is c, no matter what the medium. However, the process always starts from zero amplitude and builds up.

The members of the class are Dirichlet series which obey four axioms that seem to capture the essential properties satisfied by most functions that are commonly called L-functions or zeta functions. Although the exact nature of the class is conjectural, the hope is that the definition of the class will lead to a classification of its contents and an elucidation of its properties, including insight into their relationship to automorphic forms and the Riemann hypothesis. The class was defined by Atle Selberg in , who preferred not to use the word \\"axiom\\" that later authors have employed.The title of Selberg's paper is somewhat a spoof on Paul Erd≈ës, who had many papers named (approximately) \\"(Some) Old and new problems and results about...\\". Indeed, the 1989 Amalfi conference was quite surprising in that both Selberg and Erd≈ës were present, with the story being that Selberg did not know that Erd≈ës was to attend. Definition The formal definition of the class S is the set of all Dirichlet series :F(s)=\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{a_n}{n^s} absolutely convergent for Re(s) > 1 that satisfy four axioms (or assumptions as Selberg calls them): {p^{ns}}\\\\Big) and, for some Œ∏ < 1/2, :b_{p^n}=O(p^{n\\\\theta}).\\\\, }} =Comments on definition= The condition that the real part of Œºi be non-negative is because there are known L-functions that do not satisfy the Riemann hypothesis when Œºi is negative. Specifically, there are Maass forms associated with exceptional eigenvalues, for which the Ramanujan‚ÄìPeterssen conjecture holds, and have a functional equation, but do not satisfy the Riemann hypothesis. The condition that Œ∏ < 1/2 is important, as the Œ∏ = 1/2 case includes the Dirichlet eta-function, which violates the Riemann hypothesis. It is a consequence of 4. that the an are multiplicative and that :F_p(s)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{a_{p^n}}{p^{ns}}\\\\text{ for Re}(s)>0. =Examples= The prototypical example of an element in S is the Riemann zeta function. Another example, is the L-function of the modular discriminant Œî :L(s,\\\\Delta)=\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{a_n}{n^s} where a_n=\\\\tau(n)/n^{11/2} and œÑ(n) is the Ramanujan tau function. All known examples are automorphic L-functions, and the reciprocals of Fp(s) are polynomials in p‚àís of bounded degree. The best results on the structure of the Selberg class are due to Kaczorowski and Perelli, who show that the Dirichlet L-functions (including the Riemann zeta-function) are the only examples with degree less than 2. Basic properties As with the Riemann zeta function, an element F of S has trivial zeroes that arise from the poles of the gamma factor Œ≥(s). The other zeroes are referred to as the non-trivial zeroes of F. These will all be located in some strip . Denoting the number of non-trivial zeroes of F with by NF(T),The zeroes on the boundary are counted with half-multiplicity. Selberg showed that :N_F(T)=d_F\\\\frac{T\\\\log(T+C)}{2\\\\pi}+O(\\\\log T). Here, dF is called the degree (or dimension) of F. It is given byWhile the œâi are not uniquely defined by F, Selberg's result shows that their sum is well-defined. :d_F=2\\\\sum_{i=1}^k\\\\omega_i. It can be shown that F = 1 is the only function in S whose degree is less than 1. If F and G are in the Selberg class, then so is their product and :d_{FG}=d_F+d_G. A function in S is called primitive if whenever it is written as F = F1F2, with Fi in S, then F = F1 or F = F2. If dF = 1, then F is primitive. Every function of S can be written as a product of primitive functions. Selberg's conjectures, described below, imply that the factorization into primitive functions is unique. Examples of primitive functions include the Riemann zeta function and Dirichlet L-functions of primitive Dirichlet characters. Assuming conjectures 1 and 2 below, L-functions of irreducible cuspidal automorphic representations that satisfy the Ramanujan conjecture are primitive. Selberg's conjectures In , Selberg made conjectures concerning the functions in S: *Conjecture 1: For all F in S, there is an integer nF such that ::\\\\sum_{p\\\\leq x}\\\\frac{a_p^2}{p}=n_F\\\\log\\\\log x+O(1) :and nF = 1 whenever F is primitive. *Conjecture 2: For distinct primitive F, F‚Ä≤ ‚àà S, ::\\\\sum_{p\\\\leq x}\\\\frac{a_pa_p^\\\\prime}{p}=O(1). *Conjecture 3: If F is in S with primitive factorization ::F=\\\\prod_{i=1}^mF_i, :œá is a primitive Dirichlet character, and the function ::F^\\\\chi(s)=\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{\\\\chi(n)a_n}{n^s} :is also in S, then the functions Fiœá are primitive elements of S (and consequently, they form the primitive factorization of Fœá). *Riemann hypothesis for S: For all F in S, the non-trivial zeroes of F all lie on the line Re(s) = 1/2. =Consequences of the conjectures= Conjectures 1 and 2 imply that if F has a pole of order m at s = 1, then F(s)/Œ∂(s)m is entire. In particular, they imply Dedekind's conjecture.A celebrated conjecture of Dedekind asserts that for any finite algebraic extension F of \\\\mathbb{Q}, the zeta function \\\\zeta_F (s) is divisible by the Riemann zeta function \\\\zeta (s). That is, the quotient \\\\zeta_F (s)/\\\\zeta(s) is entire. More generally, Dedekind conjectures that if K is a finite extension of F, then \\\\zeta_K (s)/\\\\zeta_F(s) should be entire. This conjecture is still open. M. Ram Murty showed in that conjectures 1 and 2 imply the Artin conjecture. In fact, Murty showed that Artin L-functions corresponding to irreducible representations of the Galois group of a solvable extension of the rationals are automorphic as predicted by the Langlands conjectures. The functions in S also satisfy an analogue of the prime number theorem: F(s) has no zeroes on the line Re(s) = 1\\\\. As mentioned above, conjectures 1 and 2 imply the unique factorization of functions in S into primitive functions. Another consequence is that the primitivity of F is equivalent to nF = 1.

It is described as a \\"resuscitation technique\\" in which through prolonged coughing and deep breathing every 2 seconds, a person suffering a cardiac dysrhythmia immediately before cardiac arrest can keep conscious until help arrives (or until the person can get to the nearest hospital). Neither the American Heart Association nor the American Red Cross endorses cough CPR during a heart attack. This confusion appears to revolve primarily over the public's failure to discriminate between a heart attack, cardiac arrest and cardiac dysrhythmias. A heart attack occurs when an occlusion (e.g. blood clot) of an artery in the heart slowly causes tissue to die. This can result in chest pain and discomfort, and requires immediate medical attention to resolve the occlusion by emergency surgery or cardiac clot-busting drugs. A cardiac dysrhythmia is primarily an electrical problem within the heart, and is sometimes treated with electrolytes, vagal maneuver, or electrical cardioversion. Many dysrhythmias may herald an impending heart attack. Chain E-mails Cough CPR has been the subject of a series of chain email campaigns.

History Settlement at Ke≈æmarok dates back to the Upper Stone Age. In the 13th century the region contained a community of Saxons, a Slovak fishing village, a Hungarian border post and a Carpathian German settlement. Its Latin name was first mentioned in 1251 as Villa (Saxonum apud Ecclesiam) Sancte Elisabeth. In 1269 Ke≈æmarok received its town charter. It also had the right to organize a cheese market (hence the German name Kesmark (\\"K√§semarkt\\" - \\"cheese market\\"). In 1433 the town was severely damaged by a Hussite raid. After 1440, the count of Spi≈° had a seat in Ke≈æmarok. In the 15th century (and then once more in 1655), Ke≈æmarok became a free royal town. The town was a stronghold of the noble Th√∂k√∂ly family. The Hungarian magnate and warrior Imre Th√∂k√∂ly was born in the town in 1657. He died in exile in Turkey in 1705 but in the 20th century his body was returned to Ke≈æmarok and he is buried in a noble mausoleum in the town's Lutheran church.

Ke≈æmarok had an ethnic German majority until around 1910, and Germans stayed a large minority until the end of World War II. It also had a large and active Jewish community. During World War II, under the auspices of the First Slovak Republic, nearly 3,000 of the town's Jews were deported to German death camps. The town's pre-war Jewish cemetery has now been restored. Demographics According to the 2001 census, the town had 17,383 inhabitants. 95.21% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 1.59% Roma, 0.83% Czechs and 0.43% Germans.

He was Archbishop of Dubuque from 1962 to 1983, having previously served as Auxiliary Bishop of St. Paul (1947‚Äì56) and Bishop of Boise (1956‚Äì62). Early life and education James Byrne was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, to Philip Joseph and Mary Agnes (n√©e McMonigal) –íyrne. One of nine children, he had five brothers and three sisters; one of his brothers, Thomas R. Byrne, served as Mayor of St. Paul from 1966 to 1970. Another brother, Robert Byrne, was an instructor of Latin at Saint Thomas Military Academy. After graduating from parochial school, he attended Cretin High School in St. Paul. Byrne enrolled at Nazareth Hall Preparatory Seminary in 1924. In 1927, he continued his studies for the priesthood at St. Paul Seminary. He earned a Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. in 1933. Priesthood On June 3, 1933, Byrne was ordained a priest by Archbishop John Gregory Murray at St. Paul Cathedral. His first assignment was as a curate at St. Peter's Church in Mendota. He continued his studies at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, where he earned a Doctor of Sacred Theology degree in 1937 with a thesis entitled: \\"Idea of Development of Doctrine in Anglican Writings of John Henry Newman.\\" Following his return to Minnesota, Byrne served as professor of philosophy and theology (1937‚Äì45) and academic dean (1941‚Äì45) at the College of St. Thomas. He was also a part-time professor of theology at the College of St. Catherine (1940‚Äì47) and a professor of theology at St. Paul Seminary (1945‚Äì47). In addition to his academic duties, he served as a chaplain at local religious institutions. Episcopacy =St. Paul= On May 10, 1947, Byrne was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and titular bishop of Etenna by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following July 2 from Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, with Bishops Thomas Anthony Welch and Francis Joseph Schenk serving as co-consecrators, at St. Paul Cathedral. He selected as his episcopal motto: Ad Jesum Per Mariam (Latin: \\"To Jesus through Mary\\"). As an auxiliary bishop, Byrne served as pastor of the Church of the Nativity in St. Paul (1948‚Äì56). =Boise= Following the death of Bishop Edward Kelly, Byrne was appointed the fourth Bishop of Boise, Idaho, on June 16, 1956. His installation took place at Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist on August 29 of that year. He remained in Boise for nearly six years. =Dubuque= Archbishop Byrne's coat of arms over the main entrance into St. Raphael's Cathedral, Dubuque Following the appointment of Archbishop Leo Binz to the Archdiocese of Saint Paul, Pope John XXIII named Byrne the ninth bishop and seventh archbishop of Dubuque on March 7, 1962. He was installed as archbishop by the Apostolic Delegate on May 8, 1962, in St. Raphael's Cathedral. Archbishop Byrne would serve as the leader of the Dubuque Archdiocese for 21 years. From 1962-1965, Byrne was present at all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council. Following the council he was responsible for implementing the reforms promulgated by the council within the archdiocese. During his time in office, Archbishop Byrne maintained a relatively low profile in the community. He was noted for asking that Catholics join him in a televised recitation of the Rosary before the evening news, and had cards produced that people could place on top of their television sets. Archbishop Byrne also encouraged the growing cooperation among the Roman Catholic and Protestant seminaries and colleges in Dubuque and often accepted invitations to participate in seminars and to speak to classes. On one occasion, in an airport, he encountered a Protestant seminarian he had come to know through these activities who was going to interview for a parish position and offered his blessing for his success and for his future ministry. He also devoted as much time as he could to visiting those who were hospitalized in Dubuque. In 1966 the archdiocese was one the nation's first dioceses to establish a Priests' Senate. The following year the Archdiocesan Board of Education was established, and adult education was started at the parish level. The Priest Personnel Board was established in 1968 to advise the archbishop on priest assignments in the archdiocese. In 1970 an Interim Pastoral Council was developed as an advisory and consultative group. Villa Raphael was opened in 1971 as a home for retired priests.http://www.encyclopediadubuque.org/index.php?title=BYRNE%2C_James_J. On October 4, 1979, Pope John Paul II made his historic visit to Iowa with Archbishop Byrne serving as his official host in his role as \\"Primate of Iowa.\\" Byrne was also Chancellor of Loras College. Pope John Paul II accepted Byrne's resignation on August 23, 1983, and he was named Archbishop Emeritus of Dubuque. Following his retirement, Byrne remained in the Dubuque area. He died while a resident at the Stonehill Care Center (operated by Franciscan Sisters) in Dubuque on August 2, 1996, and was buried in the mortuary chapel of St. Raphael's Cathedral along with other deceased bishops and archbishops of the archdiocese. Archbishop Byrne had earlier purchased a simple wooden casket from the monks of New Melleray Abbey and stored it at the Cathedral; this was the casket in which he was buried.

Ba≈°ƒçar≈°ija was built in the 15th century when Isa-Beg Isakoviƒá founded the city. Ba≈°ƒçar≈°ija is located on the north bank of the river Miljacka, in the municipality of Stari Grad. On Ba≈°ƒçar≈°ija there are several important historic buildings, such as the Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque and sahat-kula. Today Ba≈°ƒçar≈°ija is the major tourist attraction of Sarajevo. Etymology The word Ba≈°ƒçar≈°ija derives from the Turkish language. The word \\"ba≈°\\" which is \\"ba≈ü\\" in Turkish literally means \\"head\\", in some contexts however also \\"primary\\", \\"main\\", \\"capital\\" and \\"ƒçar≈°ija\\" which is \\"√ßar≈üƒ±\\" in Turkish means \\"bazaar\\" or \\"market\\". The suffix 'ja' (modern Turkish: '(y)a') means 'to' in Turkish, meaning the full name of the district translates to 'to the main bazaar' in Turkish. However, it is more likely that the ending -ija is a Bosnianism, as many Turkish loanwords have the same ending to conform to Bosnian grammatical rules.Graham, Florence. Turkish Loanwords in Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century Bosnian and Bulgarian Franciscan Texts In the nominative case, the place has always been referred to in Turkish as \\"Ba≈ü√ßar≈üƒ±\\" only, without \\"ya\\". History One of the entrances to Gazi Husrev-Beg's Bezistan Before the arrival of the Ottomans in the largest settlement on Sarajevo field was the village square Tornik, which was located at the crossroad of the roads where today is the Ali Pasha's Mosque. Ba≈°ƒçar≈°ija was built in 1462 when Isa-Beg Isakoviƒá built the Ishakoviƒá han, in addition to its many shops. Around the main entrance, the Bazerd≈æani ƒçar≈°ija was formed. The ƒçar≈°ija Kazaz is situated to the west, and to the north sit both the ƒçar≈°ija Sedlar and Saraƒça. The most significant buildings constructed during this period were mosques. Ba≈°ƒçar≈°ija's famous mosque was built by Haved≈æa Durak in 1528, and Gazi Husrev-beg built his mosque in 1530. Gazi Husrev-Beg raises a madrassa, a library, a haniqah, the Gazi Husrev-Beg Hamam, the Gazi Husrev-Beg bezistan, the Moriƒáa Han, sahat-kula and other tourist attractions in Ba≈°ƒçar≈°ija. Gazi Husrev-Beg was buried in the harem of his mosque, beside the harem is the T√ºrbe of his freed slave and the first mutevelija of his vakuf, Murat-beg Tardiƒá. Along with Islamic places of worship erected at that time, Ba≈°ƒçar≈°ija is also the location of the Old Orthodox Church, built sometimes during 16th century and first mentioned in Ottoman sources from 1539, and also the first Sephardi temple, called Old Synagogue which is built between 1581-87. Just next to the Old Synagogue ( = Old Temple) some time later was built New Synagogue ( = New Temple). Today the Jewish community uses the more recently erected synagogue just across the Miljacka river, while both Old and New synagogue buildings are used as Jewish cultural centers. The New Synagogue was donated by the Jewish community to the city of Sarajevo and serves as a gallery called Novi Hram. The Old Synagogue building was turned into the Jewish Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is considered to be one of the finest exhibition spaces in the former Yugoslavia. Old Orthodox Church in Sarajevo, 16th century. The Old Synagogue, today the Jewish Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was the first Sephardi temple in Sarajevo, built between 1581-87. During the 16th century a number of commercial facilities was built, such as bezistans, hans, and caravanserais. Sarajevo was an important center of trade in the Balkans and had three bezistans (today the Gazi Husrev-Beg and Brusa bezistans are still standing). There were colonies of Venetian and Ragusan traders, and Ba≈°ƒçar≈°ija had approximately 12,000 commercial and craft shops. After the earthquake in 1640 and several fires in 1644 and 1656, Sarajevo was 1697 burned and devastated by the troops of Prince Eugene of Savoy. Travel writer Evliya √áelebi wrote: ::\\"The ƒçar≈°ija has in everything, one thousand and eighty stores that are a model of beauty. The ƒçar≈°ija is very attractive and built according to plan.\\" The city of Sarajevo didn't expand significantly until the 19th century. With the Austro-Hungarian occupation in 1878, foreign architects wanted to re-build Sarajevo into a modern European city. A fire contributed to this process, destroying parts of the Stari Grad. During the anti-Serb riots of Sarajevo in June 1914, violent mobs looted and vandalized several Serb-owned shops in Ba≈°ƒçar≈°ija as well as other parts of the city.

Apartheid was characterised by an authoritarian political culture based on baasskap (or white supremacy), which ensured that South Africa was dominated politically, socially, and economically by the nation's minority white population. According to this system of social stratification, white citizens had the highest status, followed by Asians and Coloureds, then black Africans. The economic legacy and social effects of apartheid continue to the present day. Broadly speaking, apartheid was delineated into petty apartheid, which entailed the segregation of public facilities and social events, and grand apartheid, which dictated housing and employment opportunities by race. Prior to the 1940s, some aspects of apartheid had already emerged in the form of minority rule by white South Africans and the socially enforced separation of black Africans from other races, which later extended to pass laws and land apportionment. Apartheid was adopted as a formal policy by the South African government after the ascension of the National Party (NP) during the 1948 general elections. A codified system of racial stratification began to take form in South Africa under the Dutch Empire in the eighteenth century, although informal segregation was present much earlier due to social cleavages between Dutch colonists and a creolised, ethnically diverse slave population. With the rapid growth and industrialisation of the British Cape Colony, racial policies and laws which had previously been relatively relaxed became increasingly rigid, discriminating specifically against black Africans, in the last decade of the 19th century. The policies of the Boer republics were also racially exclusive; for instance, the Transvaal's constitution barred black African and Coloured participation in church and state. The first apartheid law was the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, 1949, followed closely by the Immorality Amendment Act of 1950, which made it illegal for most South African citizens to marry or pursue sexual relationships across racial lines. The Population Registration Act, 1950 classified all South Africans into one of four racial groups based on appearance, known ancestry, socioeconomic status, and cultural lifestyle: \\"Black\\", \\"White\\", \\"Coloured\\", and \\"Indian\\", the last two of which included several sub-classifications.Baldwin-Ragaven, Laurel; London, Lesley; du Gruchy, Jeanelle (1999). An ambulance of the wrong colour: health professionals, human rights and ethics in South Africa. Juta and Company Limited. p. 18 Places of residence were determined by racial classification. Between 1960 and 1983, 3.5 million black Africans were removed from their homes and forced into segregated neighbourhoods as a result of apartheid legislation, in some of the largest mass evictions in modern history. Most of these targeted removals were intended to restrict the black population to ten designated \\"tribal homelands\\", also known as bantustans, four of which became nominally independent states. The government announced that relocated persons would lose their South African citizenship as they were absorbed into the bantustans. Apartheid sparked significant international and domestic opposition, resulting in some of the most influential global social movements of the twentieth century. It was the target of frequent condemnation in the United Nations and brought about an extensive arms and trade embargo on South Africa. During the 1970s and 1980s, internal resistance to apartheid became increasingly militant, prompting brutal crackdowns by the National Party government and protracted sectarian violence that left thousands dead or in detention. Some reforms of the apartheid system were undertaken, including allowing for Indian and Coloured political representation in parliament, but these measures failed to appease most activist groups. Between 1987 and 1993, the National Party entered into bilateral negotiations with the African National Congress (ANC), the leading anti-apartheid political movement, for ending segregation and introducing majority rule. In 1990, prominent ANC figures such as Nelson Mandela were released from prison. Apartheid legislation was repealed on 17 June 1991, pending multiracial elections held under a universal suffrage set for April 1994. Etymology Apartheid is an Afrikaans word meaning \\"separateness\\", or \\"the state of being apart\\", literally \\"apart-hood\\" (from Afrikaans \\"-heid\\").Shore, Megan.

Precursors  Under the 1806 Cape Articles of Capitulation the new British colonial rulers were required to respect previous legislation enacted under Roman Dutch law and this led to a separation of the law in South Africa from English Common Law and a high degree of legislative autonomy. The governors and assemblies that governed the legal process in the various colonies of South Africa were launched on a different and independent legislative path from the rest of the British Empire. In the days of slavery, slaves required passes to travel away from their masters. In 1797 the Landdrost and Heemraden of Swellendam and Graaff-Reinet extended pass laws beyond slaves and ordained that all Khoikhoi (designated as Hottentots) moving about the country for any purpose should carry passes. This was confirmed by the British Colonial government in 1809 by the Hottentot Proclamation, which decreed that if a Khoikhoi were to move they would need a pass from their master or a local official. Ordinance No. 49 of 1828 decreed that prospective black immigrants were to be granted passes for the sole purpose of seeking work. These passes were to be issued for Coloureds and Khoikhoi, but not for other Africans, who were still forced to carry passes. The United Kingdom's Slavery Abolition Act 1833 (3 & 4 Will. IV c. 73) abolished slavery throughout the British Empire and overrode the Cape Articles of Capitulation. To comply with the act the South African legislation was expanded to include Ordinance 1 in 1835, which effectively changed the status of slaves to indentured labourers. This was followed by Ordinance 3 in 1848, which introduced an indenture system for Xhosa that was little different from slavery. The various South African colonies passed legislation throughout the rest of the nineteenth century to limit the freedom of unskilled workers, to increase the restrictions on indentured workers and to regulate the relations between the races. In the Cape Colony, which previously had a liberal and multi-racial constitution and a system of franchise open to men of all races, the Franchise and Ballot Act of 1892 raised the property franchise qualification and added an educational element, disenfranchising a disproportionate number of the Cape's non-white voters,Gish, Steven (2000). Alfred B. Xuma: African, American, South African. New York University Press. p. 8. and the Glen Grey Act of 1894 instigated by the government of Prime Minister Cecil John Rhodes limited the amount of land Africans could hold. Similarly, in Natal, the Natal Legislative Assembly Bill of 1894 deprived Indians of the right to vote.Hoiberg, Dale; Ramchandani, Indu (2000). Students' Britannica India, Volumes 1‚Äì5. Popular Prakashan. p. 142. In 1896 the South African Republic brought in two pass laws requiring Africans to carry a badge. Only those employed by a master were permitted to remain on the Rand and those entering a \\"labour district\\" needed a special pass. In 1905 the General Pass Regulations Act denied blacks the vote and limited them to fixed areas, and in 1906 the Asiatic Registration Act of the Transvaal Colony required all Indians to register and carry passes.{better source needed} Nojeim, Michael J.

In 1910, the Union of South Africa was created as a self-governing dominion, which continued the legislative programme: the South Africa Act (1910) enfranchised whites, giving them complete political control over all other racial groups while removing the right of blacks to sit in parliament,Leach, Graham (1986).

The United Party government began to move away from the rigid enforcement of segregationist laws during World War II.Ambrosio, Thomas (2002). Ethnic identity groups and U.S. foreign policy. Greenwood Publishing Group. pp. 56‚Äì57. Amid fears integration would eventually lead to racial assimilation, the National Party established the Sauer Commission to investigate the effects of the United Party's policies. The commission concluded that integration would bring about a \\"loss of personality\\" for all racial groups.  Institution  = Election of 1948 = Daniel Fran√ßois Malan, the first apartheid-era prime minister (19481954) South Africa had allowed social custom and law to govern the consideration of multiracial affairs and of the allocation, in racial terms, of access to economic, social, and political status. Most white South Africans, regardless of their own differences, accepted the prevailing pattern. Nevertheless, by 1948 it remained apparent that there were gaps in the social structure, whether legislated or otherwise, concerning the rights and opportunities of nonwhites. The rapid economic development of World War II attracted black migrant workers in large numbers to chief industrial centres, where they compensated for the wartime shortage of white labour. However, this escalated rate of black urbanisation went unrecognised by the South African government, which failed to accommodate the influx with parallel expansion in housing or social services. Overcrowding, increasing crime rates, and disillusionment resulted; urban blacks came to support a new generation of leaders influenced by the principles of self-determination and popular freedoms enshrined in such statements as the Atlantic Charter. Whites reacted negatively to the changes, allowing the Herenigde Nasionale Party (or simply the National Party) to convince a large segment of the voting bloc that the impotence of the United Party in curtailing the evolving position of nonwhites indicated that the organisation had fallen under the influence of Western liberals. Many Afrikaners, white South Africans chiefly of Dutch descent but with early infusions of Germans and French Huguenots who were soon assimilated, also resented what they perceived as disempowerment by an underpaid black workforce and the superior economic power and prosperity of white English speakers.P. Brits, Modern South Africa: Afrikaner power, the politics of race, and resistance, 1902 to the 1970s (Pretoria, University of South Africa Press, 2007), p37 In addition, Jan Smuts, as a strong advocate of the United Nations, lost domestic support when South Africa was criticised for its colour bar and the continued mandate of South West Africa by other UN member states.O'Meara, Dan. Forty Lost Years : The National Party and the Politics of the South African State, 1948‚Äì1994. Athens: Ohio University Press, 1996. Afrikaner nationalists proclaimed that they offered the voters a new policy to ensure continued white domination.M. Meredith, In the Name of Apartheid, London: Hamish Hamilton, 1988, This policy was initially expounded from a theory drafted by Hendrik Verwoerd and was presented to the National Party by the Sauer Commission. It called for a systematic effort to organise the relations, rights, and privileges of the races as officially defined through a series of parliamentary acts and administrative decrees. Segregation had thus been pursued only in major matters, such as separate schools, and local society rather than law had been depended upon to enforce most separation; it should now be extended to everything. The party gave this policy a nameapartheid (apartness). Apartheid was to be the basic ideological and practical foundation of Afrikaner politics for the next quarter of a century. The National Party's election platform stressed that apartheid would preserve a market for white employment in which nonwhites could not compete. On the issues of black urbanisation, the regulation of nonwhite labour, influx control, social security, farm tariffs, and nonwhite taxation the United Party's policy remained contradictory and confused. Its traditional bases of support not only took mutually exclusive positions, but found themselves increasingly at odds with each other. Smuts' reluctance to consider South African foreign policy against the mounting tensions of the Cold War also stirred up discontent, while the nationalists promised to purge the state and public service of communist sympathisers. First to desert the United Party were Afrikaner farmers, who wished to see a change in influx control due to problems with squatters, as well as higher prices for their maize and other produce in the face of the mineowners' demand for cheap food policies. Always identified with the affluent and capitalist, the party also failed to appeal to its working class constituents. Populist rhetoric allowed the National Party to sweep eight constituencies in the mining and industrial centres of the Witwatersrand and five more in Pretoria. Barring the predominantly English-speaking landowner electorate of the Natal, the United Party was defeated in almost every rural district. Its urban losses in the nation's most populous province, the Transvaal, proved equally devastating. As the voting system was disproportionately weighted in favour of rural constituencies and the Transvaal in particular, the 1948 election catapulted the Herenigde Nasionale Party from a small minority party to a commanding position with an eight-vote parliamentary lead. Daniel Fran√ßois Malan became the first nationalist prime minister, with the aim of implementing the apartheid philosophy and silencing liberal opposition. When the National Party came to power in 1948, there were factional differences in the party about the implementation of systemic racial segregation. The \\"baasskap\\" (white domination or supremacist) faction, which was the dominant faction in the NP, and state institutions, favoured systematic segregation, but also favoured the participation of black Africans in the economy with black labour controlled to advance the economic gains of Afrikaners. A second faction were the \\"purists\\", who believed in \\"vertical segregation\\", in which blacks and whites would be entirely separated, with blacks living in native reserves, with separate political and economic structures, which, they believed, would entail severe short-term pain, but would also lead to independence of white South Africa from black labour in the long-term. A third faction, which included Hendrik Verwoerd, sympathised with the purists, but allowed for the use of black labour, while implementing the purist goal of vertical separation. = Legislation = NP leaders argued that South Africa did not comprise a single nation, but was made up of four distinct racial groups: white, black, Coloured and Indian. Such groups were split into 13 nations or racial federations. White people encompassed the English and Afrikaans language groups; the black populace was divided into ten such groups. The state passed laws that paved the way for \\"grand apartheid\\", which was centred on separating races on a large scale, by compelling people to live in separate places defined by race. This strategy was in part adopted from \\"left-over\\" British rule that separated different racial groups after they took control of the Boer republics in the Anglo-Boer war. This created the black-only \\"townships\\" or \\"locations\\", where blacks were relocated to their own towns. In addition, \\"petty apartheid\\" laws were passed. The principal apartheid laws were as follows.Alistair Boddy- Evans. African History: Apartheid Legislation in South Africa, About.com. Retrieved 5 June 2007. The first grand apartheid law was the Population Registration Act of 1950, which formalised racial classification and introduced an identity card for all persons over the age of 18, specifying their racial group.Boddy-Evans, Alistar. Population Registration Act No 30 of 1950. About.com. Official teams or boards were established to come to a conclusion on those people whose race was unclear.Ungar, Sanford (1989).

This caused difficulty, especially for Coloured people, separating their families when members were allocated different races.Goldin, Ian (1987).

Group Areas Act No 41 of 1950. About.com. Until then, most settlements had people of different races living side by side. This Act put an end to diverse areas and determined where one lived according to race. Each race was allotted its own area, which was used in later years as a basis of forced removal.Besteman, Catherine Lowe (2008). Transforming Cape Town. University of California Press. p. 6. The Prevention of Illegal Squatting Act of 1951 allowed the government to demolish black shanty town slums and forced white employers to pay for the construction of housing for those black workers who were permitted to reside in cities otherwise reserved for whites.Boddy-Evans, Alistar. Apartheid Legislation in South Africa. About.com. The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949 prohibited marriage between persons of different races, and the Immorality Act of 1950 made sexual relations with a person of a different race a criminal offence. Under the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act of 1953, municipal grounds could be reserved for a particular race, creating, among other things, separate beaches, buses, hospitals, schools and universities. Signboards such as \\"whites only\\" applied to public areas, even including park benches.Beck, Roger B. (2000). The history of South Africa. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 128. . Black South Africans were provided with services greatly inferior to those of whites, and, to a lesser extent, to those of Indian and Coloured people. Further laws had the aim of suppressing resistance, especially armed resistance, to apartheid. The Suppression of Communism Act of 1950 banned any party subscribing to Communism. The act defined Communism and its aims so sweepingly that anyone who opposed government policy risked being labelled as a Communist. Since the law specifically stated that Communism aimed to disrupt racial harmony, it was frequently used to gag opposition to apartheid. Disorderly gatherings were banned, as were certain organisations that were deemed threatening to the government. The Bantu Authorities Act of 1951 created separate government structures for blacks and whites and was the first piece of legislation to support the government's plan of separate development in the bantustans. The Promotion of Black Self-Government Act of 1959 entrenched the NP policy of nominally independent \\"homelands\\" for blacks. So- called \\"self‚Äìgoverning Bantu units\\" were proposed, which would have devolved administrative powers, with the promise later of autonomy and self-government. It also abolished the seats of white representatives of black South Africans and removed from the rolls the few blacks still qualified to vote. The Bantu Investment Corporation Act of 1959 set up a mechanism to transfer capital to the homelands to create employment there. Legislation of 1967 allowed the government to stop industrial development in \\"white\\" cities and redirect such development to the \\"homelands\\". The Black Homeland Citizenship Act of 1970 marked a new phase in the Bantustan strategy. It changed the status of blacks to citizens of one of the ten autonomous territories. The aim was to ensure a demographic majority of white people within South Africa by having all ten Bantustans achieve full independence. Interracial contact in sport was frowned upon, but there were no segregatory sports laws. The government tightened pass laws compelling blacks to carry identity documents, to prevent the immigration of blacks from other countries. To reside in a city, blacks had to be in employment there. Until 1956 women were for the most part excluded from these pass requirements, as attempts to introduce pass laws for women were met with fierce resistance. = Disenfranchisement of Coloured voters = Cape Coloured children in Bonteheuwel Annual per capita personal income by race group in South Africa relative to white levels. In 1950, D. F. Malan announced the NP's intention to create a Coloured Affairs Department.Van der Ross, R. E.; Marais, Johannes Stephanus (1986).

Strijdom, Malan's successor as Prime Minister, moved to strip voting rights from black and Coloured residents of the Cape Province. The previous government had introduced the Separate Representation of Voters Bill into Parliament in 1951, turning it to be an Act on 18 June 1951; however, four voters, G Harris, W D Franklin, W D Collins and Edgar Deane, challenged its validity in court with support from the United Party.Davis, Dennis; Le Roux, Michelle (2009). Precedent & Possibility: The (Ab)use of Law in South Africa. Juta and Company Limited. p. 20. . The Cape Supreme Court upheld the act, but reversed by the Appeal Court, finding the act invalid because a two-thirds majority in a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament was needed to change the entrenched clauses of the Constitution.Rielations.

The first people of the Cape: a look at their history and the impact of colonialism on the Cape's indigenous people. New Africa Books. p. 72. Immediately after the vote, the Senate was restored to its original size. The Senate Act was contested in the Supreme Court, but the recently enlarged Appeal Court, packed with government-supporting judges, upheld the act, and also the Act to remove Coloured voters.Du Pre, R H. (1994). Separate but Unequal ‚Äì The 'Coloured' People of South Africa ‚Äì A Political History. Jonathan Ball Publishers, Johannesburg. pp. 134‚Äì139. The 1956 law allowed Coloureds to elect four people to Parliament, but a 1969 law abolished those seats and stripped Coloureds of their right to vote. Since Asians had never been allowed to vote, this resulted in whites being the sole enfranchised group. A 2016 study in the Journal of Politics suggests that disenfranchisement in South Africa had a significant negative impact on basic service delivery to the disenfranchised. = Division among whites = Before South Africa became a republic in 1961, politics among white South Africans was typified by the division between the mainly Afrikaner pro-republic conservative and the largely English anti-republican liberal sentiments,Muller (1975), p. 508. with the legacy of the Boer War still a factor for some people. Once South Africa became a republic, Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd called for improved relations and greater accord between people of British descent and the Afrikaners.Booth, Douglas (1998). The race game: sport and politics in South Africa. Routledge. p. 89. He claimed that the only difference was between those in favour of apartheid and those against it. The ethnic division would no longer be between Afrikaans and English speakers, but between blacks and whites. Most Afrikaners supported the notion of unanimity of white people to ensure their safety. White voters of British descent were divided. Many had opposed a republic, leading to a majority \\"no\\" vote in Natal.Thompson, Paul Singer (1990). Natalians first: separatism in South Africa, 1909‚Äì1961. Southern Book Publishers. p. 167. Later, some of them recognised the perceived need for white unity, convinced by the growing trend of decolonisation elsewhere in Africa, which concerned them. British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's \\"Wind of Change\\" speech left the British faction feeling that the United Kingdom had abandoned them.Joyce, Peter (2007). The making of a nation: South Africa's road to freedom. Zebra. p. 118. The more conservative English speakers supported Verwoerd;Suzman, Helen (1993). In no uncertain terms: a South African memoir.

They were displeased by having to choose between British and South African nationalities. Although Verwoerd tried to bond these different blocs, the subsequent voting illustrated only a minor swell of support,Lacour-Gayet, Robert (1977). A history of South Africa. Cassell. p. 311. indicating that a great many English speakers remained apathetic and that Verwoerd had not succeeded in uniting the white population.  Homeland system  Map of the 20 bantustans in South Africa and South West Africa. Under the homeland system, the government attempted to divide South Africa and South West Africa into a number of separate states, each of which was supposed to develop into a separate nation-state for a different ethnic group.p. 15 Territorial separation was hardly a new institution. There were, for example, the \\"reserves\\" created under the British government in the nineteenth century. Under apartheid, 13 percent of the land was reserved for black homelands, a small amount relative to its total population, and generally in economically unproductive areas of the country. The Tomlinson Commission of 1954 justified apartheid and the homeland system, but stated that additional land ought to be given to the homelands, a recommendation that was not carried out.Evans, Ivan. Bureaucracy and Race: Native Administration in South Africa. Berkeley: U of California, 1997. N. pag. Print. When Verwoerd became Prime Minister in 1958, the policy of \\"separate development\\" came into being, with the homeland structure as one of its cornerstones. Verwoerd came to believe in the granting of independence to these homelands. The government justified its plans on the ostensible basis that \\"(the) government's policy is, therefore, not a policy of discrimination on the grounds of race or colour, but a policy of differentiation on the ground of nationhood, of different nations, granting to each self-determination within the borders of their homelandshence this policy of separate development\\".Amisi, Baruti, and Simphiwe Nojiyeza. Access to Decent Sanitation in South Africa: The Challenges of Eradicating the Bucket System Baruti Amisi n. pag. Feb. 2008. Web. Under the homelands system, blacks would no longer be citizens of South Africa, becoming citizens of the independent homelands who worked in South Africa as foreign migrant labourers on temporary work permits. In 1958 the Promotion of Black Self-Government Act was passed, and border industries and the Bantu Investment Corporation were established to promote economic development and the provision of employment in or near the homelands. Many black South Africans who had never resided in their identified homeland were forcibly removed from the cities to the homelands. The vision of a South Africa divided into multiple ethnostates appealed to the reform-minded Afrikaner intelligensia, and it provided a more coherent philosophical and moral framework for the National Party's policies, while also providing a veneer of intellectual respectability to the controversial policy of so-called baasskap. Rural area in Ciskei, one the four nominally independent homelands. In total, 20 homelands were allocated to an ethnic groups, ten in South Africa proper and ten in South West Africa. Of these 20 homelands, 19 were classified as black, while one, Basterland, was set aside for a sub-group of Coloureds known as Basters, who are closely related to Afrikaners. Four of the homelands were declared independent by the South African government: Transkei in 1976, Bophuthatswana in 1977, Venda in 1979, and Ciskei in 1981 (known as the TBVC states). Once a homeland was granted its nominal independence, its designated citizens had their South African citizenship revoked and replaced with citizenship in their homeland. These people were then issued passports instead of passbooks. Citizens of the nominally autonomous homelands also had their South African citizenship circumscribed, meaning they were no longer legally considered South African.Those who had the money to travel or emigrate were not given full passports; instead, travel documents were issued. The South African government attempted to draw an equivalence between their view of black citizens of the homelands and the problems which other countries faced through entry of illegal immigrants. = International recognition of the Bantustans = Bantustans within the borders of South Africa and South West Africa were classified by degree of nominal self-rule: 6 were \\"non-self-governing\\", 10 were \\"self-governing\\", and 4 were \\"independent\\". In theory, self-governing Bantustans had control over many aspects of their internal functioning but were not yet sovereign nations. Independent Bantustans (Transkei, Bophutatswana, Venda and Ciskei; also known as the TBVC states) were intended to be fully sovereign. In reality, they had no significant economic infrastructure and with few exceptions encompassed swaths of disconnected territory. This meant all the Bantustans were little more than puppet states controlled by South Africa. Throughout the existence of the independent Bantustans, South Africa remained the only country to recognise their independence. Nevertheless, internal organisations of many countries, as well as the South African government, lobbied for their recognition. For example, upon the foundation of Transkei, the Swiss-South African Association encouraged the Swiss government to recognise the new state. In 1976, leading up to a United States House of Representatives resolution urging the President to not recognise Transkei, the South African government intensely lobbied lawmakers to oppose the bill.http://kora.matrix.msu.edu/files/50/304/32-130-E84-84-al.sff.document.af000020.pdf Each TBVC state extended recognition to the other independent Bantustans while South Africa showed its commitment to the notion of TBVC sovereignty by building embassies in the TBVC capitals. = Forced removals = During the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, the government implemented a policy of \\"resettlement\\", to force people to move to their designated \\"group areas\\". Millions of people were forced to relocate. These removals included people relocated due to slum clearance programmes, labour tenants on white-owned farms, the inhabitants of the so-called \\"black spots\\" (black-owned land surrounded by white farms), the families of workers living in townships close to the homelands, and \\"surplus people\\" from urban areas, including thousands of people from the Western Cape (which was declared a \\"Coloured Labour Preference Area\\") who were moved to the Transkei and Ciskei homelands. The best-publicised forced removals of the 1950s occurred in Johannesburg, when 60,000 people were moved to the new township of Soweto (an abbreviation for South Western Townships). Until 1955, Sophiatown had been one of the few urban areas where black people were allowed to own land, and was slowly developing into a multiracial slum. As industry in Johannesburg grew, Sophiatown became the home of a rapidly expanding black workforce, as it was convenient and close to town. It had the only swimming pool for black children in Johannesburg. As one of the oldest black settlements in Johannesburg, it held an almost symbolic importance for the 50,000 black people it contained. Despite a vigorous ANC protest campaign and worldwide publicity, the removal of Sophiatown began on 9 February 1955 under the Western Areas Removal Scheme. In the early hours, heavily armed police forced residents out of their homes and loaded their belongings onto government trucks. The residents were taken to a large tract of land from the city centre, known as Meadowlands, which the government had purchased in 1953. Meadowlands became part of a new planned black city called Soweto. Sophiatown was destroyed by bulldozers, and a new white suburb named Triomf (Triumph) was built in its place. This pattern of forced removal and destruction was to repeat itself over the next few years, and was not limited to black South Africans alone. Forced removals from areas like Cato Manor (Mkhumbane) in Durban, and District Six in Cape Town, where 55,000 Coloured and Indian people were forced to move to new townships on the Cape Flats, were carried out under the Group Areas Act of 1950. Nearly 600,000 Coloured, Indian and Chinese people were moved under the Group Areas Act. Some 40,000 whites were also forced to move when land was transferred from \\"white South Africa\\" into the black homelands.  Society during apartheid  = Petty apartheid = The NP passed a string of legislation that became known as petty apartheid. The first of these was the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act 55 of 1949, prohibiting marriage between whites and people of other races. The Immorality Amendment Act 21 of 1950 (as amended in 1957 by Act 23) forbade \\"unlawful racial intercourse\\" and \\"any immoral or indecent act\\" between a white and a black, Indian or Coloured person. Blacks were not allowed to run businesses or professional practices in areas designated as \\"white South Africa\\" unless they had a permit - such being granted only exceptionally. They were required to move to the black \\"homelands\\" and set up businesses and practices there. Trains, hospitals and ambulances were segregated.On apartheid transport see Pirie, G.H. Travelling under apartheid. In D M Smith (ed.), The Apartheid City and Beyond: Urbanisation and Social Change in South Africa. Routledge, London (1992), pp. 172‚Äì181. Because of the smaller numbers of white patients and the fact that white doctors preferred to work in white hospitals, conditions in white hospitals were much better than those in often overcrowded and understaffed, significantly underfunded black hospitals.Health Sector Strategic Framework 1999‚Äì2004 ‚Äì Background , Department of Health, 2004. Retrieved 8 November 2006. Residential areas were segregated and blacks were allowed to live in white areas only if employed as a servant and even then only in servants‚Äô quarters. Blacks were excluded from working in white areas, unless they had a pass, nicknamed the dompas, also spelt dompass or dom pass. The most likely origin of this name is from the Afrikaans \\"verdomde pas\\" (meaning accursed pass),Dictionary of South African English on historical principles. Retrieved 27 December 2015. although some commentators ascribe it to the Afrikaans words meaning \\"dumb pass\\". Only blacks with \\"Section 10\\" rights (those who had migrated to the cities before World War II) were excluded from this provision. A pass was issued only to a black with approved work. Spouses and children had to be left behind in black homelands. A pass was issued for one magisterial district (usually one town) confining the holder to that area only. Being without a valid pass made a person subject to arrest and trial for being an illegal migrant. This was often followed by deportation to the person's homeland and prosecution of the employer for employing an illegal migrant. Police vans patrolled white areas to round up blacks without passes. Blacks were not allowed to employ whites in white South Africa. Although trade unions for black and Coloured workers had existed since the early 20th century, it was not until the 1980s reforms that a mass black trade union movement developed. Trade unions under apartheid were racially segregated, with 54 unions being white only, 38 for Indian and Coloured and 19 for black people. The Industrial Conciliation Act (1956) legislated against the creation of multi-racial trade unions and attempted to split existing multi-racial unions into separate branches or organisations along racial lines. Each black homeland controlled its own education, health and police systems. Blacks were not allowed to buy hard liquor. They were able to buy only state-produced poor quality beer (although this law was relaxed later). Public beaches, swimming pools, some pedestrian bridges, drive-in cinema parking spaces, graveyards, parks, and public toilets were segregated. Cinemas and theatres in white areas were not allowed to admit blacks. There were practically no cinemas in black areas. Most restaurants and hotels in white areas were not allowed to admit blacks except as staff. Blacks were prohibited from attending white churches under the Churches Native Laws Amendment Act of 1957, but this was never rigidly enforced, and churches were one of the few places races could mix without the interference of the law. Blacks earning 360 rand a year or more had to pay taxes while the white threshold was more than twice as high, at 750 rand a year. On the other hand, the taxation rate for whites was considerably higher than that for blacks. = Coloured classification = The population was classified into four groups: African, White, Indian and Coloured (capitalised to denote their legal definitions in South African law). The Coloured group included people regarded as being of mixed descent, including of Bantu, Khoisan, European and Malay ancestry. Many were descended from people brought to South Africa from other parts of the world, such as India, Sri Lanka, Madagascar and China as slaves and indentured workers.Patric Tariq Mellet \\"Intro\\", Cape Slavery Heritage. Retrieved 24 May 2011. The Population Registration Act, (Act 30 of 1950), defined South Africans as belonging to one of three races: White, Black or Coloured. People of Indian ancestry were considered Coloured under this act. Appearance, social acceptance and descent were used to determine the qualification of an individual into one of the three categories. A white person was described by the act as one whose parents were both white and possessed the \\"habits, speech, education, deportment and demeanour\\" of a white person. Blacks were defined by the act as belonging to an African race or tribe. Lastly, Coloureds were those who could not be classified as black or white. The apartheid bureaucracy devised complex (and often arbitrary) criteria at the time that the Population Registration Act was implemented to determine who was Coloured. Minor officials would administer tests to determine if someone should be categorised either Coloured or White, or if another person should be categorised either Coloured or Black. The tests included the pencil test, in which a pencil was shoved into the subjects‚Äô curly hair and the subjects made to shake their head. If the pencil stuck they were deemed to be Black; if dislodged they were pronounced Coloured. Other tests involved examining the shapes of jaw lines and buttocks and pinching people to see what language they would say \\"Ouch\\" in. As a result of these tests, different members of the same family found themselves in different race groups. Further tests determined membership of the various sub-racial groups of the Coloureds. Discriminated against by apartheid, Coloureds were as a matter of state policy forced to live in separate townships, as defined in the Group Areas Act (1950), in some cases leaving homes their families had occupied for generations, and received an inferior education, though better than that provided to Africans. They played an important role in the anti-apartheid movement: for example the African Political Organization established in 1902 had an exclusively Coloured membership. Voting rights were denied to Coloureds in the same way that they were denied to Blacks from 1950 to 1983. However, in 1977 the NP caucus approved proposals to bring Coloureds and Indians into central government. In 1982, final constitutional proposals produced a referendum among Whites, and the Tricameral Parliament was approved. The Constitution was reformed the following year to allow the Coloured and Asian minorities participation in separate Houses in a Tricameral Parliament, and Botha became the first Executive State President. The idea was that the Coloured minority could be granted voting rights, but the Black majority were to become citizens of independent homelands. These separate arrangements continued until the abolition of apartheid. The Tricameral reforms led to the formation of the (anti-apartheid) United Democratic Front as a vehicle to try to prevent the co-option of Coloureds and Indians into an alliance with Whites. The battles between the UDF and the NP government from 1983 to 1989 were to become the most intense period of struggle between left-wing and right-wing South Africans. = Education = Education was segregated by the 1953 Bantu Education Act, which crafted a separate system of education for black South African students and was designed to prepare black people for lives as a labouring class. In 1959 separate universities were created for black, Coloured and Indian people. Existing universities were not permitted to enroll new black students. The Afrikaans Medium Decree of 1974 required the use of Afrikaans and English on an equal basis in high schools outside the homelands. In the 1970s, the state spent ten times more per child on the education of white children than on black children within the Bantu Education system (the education system in black schools within white South Africa). Higher education was provided in separate universities and colleges after 1959. Eight black universities were created in the homelands. Fort Hare University in the Ciskei (now Eastern Cape) was to register only Xhosa-speaking students. Sotho, Tswana, Pedi and Venda speakers were placed at the newly founded University College of the North at Turfloop, while the University College of Zululand was launched to serve Zulu students. Coloureds and Indians were to have their own establishments in the Cape and Natal respectively. Each black homeland controlled its own education, health and police systems. By 1948, before formal Apartheid, 10 universities existed in South Africa: four were Afrikaans, four for English, one for Blacks and a Correspondence University open to all ethnic groups. By 1981, under apartheid government, 11 new universities were built: seven for Blacks, one for Coloreds, one for Indians, one for Afrikaans and one dual-language medium Afrikaans and English. = Women under apartheid = Colonialism and apartheid had a major impact on Black and Coloured women, since they suffered both racial and gender discrimination. Judith Nolde argues that in general, South African women were \\"deprive[d] [...] of their human rights as individuals\\" under the apartheid system. Jobs were often hard to find. Many Black and Coloured women worked as agricultural or domestic workers, but wages were extremely low, if existent. Children suffered from diseases caused by malnutrition and sanitation problems, and mortality rates were therefore high. The controlled movement of black and Coloured workers within the country through the Natives Urban Areas Act of 1923 and the pass laws separated family members from one another, because men could prove their employment in urban centres while most women were merely dependents; consequently, they risked being deported to rural areas. Even in rural areas there were legal hurdles for women to own land, and outside the cities jobs were scarce. = Sport under apartheid = By the 1930s, association football mirrored the balkanised society of South Africa; football was divided into numerous institutions based on race: the (White) South African Football Association, the South African Indian Football Association (SAIFA), the South African African Football Association (SAAFA) and its rival the South African Bantu Football Association, and the South African Coloured Football Association (SACFA). Lack of funds to provide proper equipment would be noticeable in regards to black amateur football matches; this revealed the unequal lives black South Africans were subject to, in contrast to Whites, who were much better off financially. Apartheid's social engineering made it more difficult to compete across racial lines. Thus, in an effort to centralise finances, the federations merged in 1951, creating the South African Soccer Federation (SASF), which brought Black, Indian, and Coloured national associations into one body that opposed apartheid. This was generally opposed more and more by the growing apartheid government, andwith urban segregation being reinforced with ongoing racist policiesit was harder to play football along these racial lines. In 1956, the Pretoria regimethe administrative capital of South Africapassed the first apartheid sports policy; by doing so, it emphasised the White-led government's opposition to inter-racialism. While football was plagued by racism, it also played a role in protesting apartheid and its policies. With the international bans from FIFA and other major sporting events, South Africa would be in the spotlight internationally. In a 1977 survey, white South Africans ranked the lack of international sport as one of the three most damaging consequences of apartheid. By the mid-1950s, Black South Africans would also use media to challenge the \\"racialisation\\" of sports in South Africa; anti-apartheid forces had begun to pinpoint sport as the \\"weakness\\" of white national morale. Black journalists for the Johannesburg Drum magazine were the first to give the issue public exposure, with an intrepid special issue in 1955 that asked, \\"Why shouldn't our blacks be allowed in the SA team?\\" As time progressed, international standing with South Africa would continue to be strained. In the 1980s, as the oppressive system was slowly collapsing the ANC and National Party started negotiations on the end of apartheid. Football associations also discussed the formation of a single, non-racial controlling body. This unity process accelerated in the late 1980s and led to the creation, in December 1991, of an incorporated South African Football Association. On 3 July 1992, FIFA finally welcomed South Africa back into international football. Sport has long been an important part of life in South Africa, and the boycotting of games by international teams had a profound effect on the white population, perhaps more so than the trade embargoes did. After the re-acceptance of South Africa's sports teams by the international community, sport played a major unifying role between the country's diverse ethnic groups. Mandela's open support of the predominantly white rugby fraternity during the 1995 Rugby World Cup was considered instrumental in bringing together South African sports fans of all races. = Asians during apartheid = Defining its Asian population, a minority that did not appear to belong to any of the initial three designated non-white groups, was a constant dilemma for the apartheid government. The classification of \\"honorary white\\" was granted to immigrants from Japan, South Korea and Taiwancountries with which South Africa maintained diplomatic and economic relationsand to their descendants. Indian South Africans during apartheid were classified many ranges of categories from \\"Asian\\" to \\"black\\" to \\"Coloured\\" and even the mono-ethnic category of \\"Indian\\", but never as white, having been considered \\"nonwhite\\" throughout South Africa's history. The group faced severe discrimination during the apartheid regime and were subject to numerous racialist policies. In a study done by Josephine C. Naidoo and Devi Moodley Rajab, they interviewed a series of Indian South Africans about their experience in South Africa. Their study highlighted education, the workplace, and general day to day living. One participant who was a doctor said that it was considered the norm for Non- White and White doctors to mingle while working at the hospital but when there was any down time or breaks, they were to go back to their segregated quarters. Not only was there severe segregation for doctors, Non-White, more specifically Indians, were paid three to four times less than their White counterparts. Many described being treated as a ‚Äúthird class citizen‚Äù due to the humiliation of the standard of treatment for Non-White employees across many professions. Many Indians described a sense of justified superiority from Whites due to the apartheid laws that, in the minds of White South Africans, legitimised those feelings. Another finding of this study was the psychological damage done to Indians living in South Africa during apartheid. One of the biggest long-term effects was inter-racial mistrust. Inter-racial mistrust is emotional hatred towards Whites. There was such a strong degree of alienation that left damaging psychological effects of inferiority. Chinese South Africanswho were descendants of migrant workers who came to work in the gold mines around Johannesburg in the late 19th centurywere initially either classified as \\"Coloured\\" or \\"Other Asian\\" and were subject to numerous forms of discrimination and restriction. It was not until 1984 that South African Chinese, increased to about 10,000, were given the same official rights as the Japanese, to be treated as whites in terms of the Group Areas Act, although they still faced discrimination and did not receive all the benefits/rights of their newly obtained honorary white status such as voting. Indonesians arrived at the Cape of Good Hope as slaves until the abolishment of slavery during the 19th century. They were predominantly Muslim, were allowed religious freedom and formed their own ethnic group/community known as Cape Malays. They were classified as part of the Coloured racial group.An appalling \\"science\\" This was the same for South Africans of Malaysian descent who were also classified as part of the Coloured race and thus considered \\"not-white\\". South Africans of Filipino descent were classified as \\"black\\" due to historical outlook on Filipinos by White South Africans, and many of them lived in Bantustans. The Lebanese population were somewhat of an anomaly during the apartheid era. Lebanese immigration to South Africa was chiefly Christian, and were originally classified as non-white; however, a court case in 1913 ruled that because Lebanese and Syrians originated from the Canaan region (the birthplace of Christianity and Judaism), they could not be discriminated against by race laws which targeted non-believers, and thus, were classified as white. The Lebanese community maintained their white status after the Population Registration Act came into effect; however, immigration from the Middle East was restricted. = Conservatism = Alongside apartheid, the National Party implemented a programme of social conservatism.

Television was not introduced until 1976 because the government viewed English programming as a threat to the Afrikaans language. Television was run on apartheid linesTV1 broadcast in Afrikaans and English (geared to a White audience), TV2 in Zulu and Xhosa, TV3 in Sotho, Tswana and Pedi (both geared to a Black audience), and TV4 mostly showed programmes for an urban Black audience.  Internal resistance  Painting of the Sharpeville Massacre which occurred on 21 March 1960 Apartheid sparked significant internal resistance. The government responded to a series of popular uprisings and protests with police brutality, which in turn increased local support for the armed resistance struggle. Internal resistance to the apartheid system in South Africa came from several sectors of society and saw the creation of organisations dedicated variously to peaceful protests, passive resistance and armed insurrection. In 1949, the youth wing of the African National Congress (ANC) took control of the organisation and started advocating a radical black nationalist programme. The new young leaders proposed that white authority could only be overthrown through mass campaigns. In 1950 that philosophy saw the launch of the Programme of Action, a series of strikes, boycotts and civil disobedience actions that led to occasional violent clashes with the authorities. In 1959, a group of disenchanted ANC members formed the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), which organised a demonstration against pass books on 21 March 1960. One of those protests was held in the township of Sharpeville, where 69 people were killed by police in the Sharpeville massacre. In the wake of Sharpeville, the government declared a state of emergency. More than 18,000 people were arrested, including leaders of the ANC and PAC, and both organisations were banned. The resistance went underground, with some leaders in exile abroad and others engaged in campaigns of domestic sabotage and terrorism. In May 1961, before the declaration of South Africa as a Republic, an assembly representing the banned ANC called for negotiations between the members of the different ethnic groupings, threatening demonstrations and strikes during the inauguration of the Republic if their calls were ignored. When the government overlooked them, the strikers (among the main organisers was a 42-year-old, Thembu-origin Nelson Mandela) carried out their threats. The government countered swiftly by giving police the authority to arrest people for up to twelve days and detaining many strike leaders amid numerous cases of police brutality.A War Won, Time, 9 June 1961 Defeated, the protesters called off their strike. The ANC then chose to launch an armed struggle through a newly formed military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), which would perform acts of sabotage on tactical state structures. Its first sabotage plans were carried out on 16 December 1961, the anniversary of the Battle of Blood River. In the 1970s, the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) was created by tertiary students influenced by the Black Power movement in the US. BCM endorsed black pride and African customs and did much to alter the feelings of inadequacy instilled among black people by the apartheid system. The leader of the movement, Steve Biko, was taken into custody on 18 August 1977 and was beaten to death in detention. In 1976, secondary students in Soweto took to the streets in the Soweto uprising to protest against the imposition of Afrikaans as the only language of instruction. On 16 June, police opened fire on students protesting peacefully. According to official reports 23 people were killed, but the number of people who died is usually given as 176, with estimates of up to 700.16 June 1976 Student Uprising in Soweto. africanhistory.about.com(Les Payne of Newsday said at least 850 murders were documented) Elsabe Brink; Gandhi Malungane; Steve Lebelo; Dumisani Ntshangase; Sue Krige, Soweto 16 June 1976, 2001, 9 In the following years several student organisations were formed to protest against apartheid, and these organisations were central to urban school boycotts in 1980 and 1983 and rural boycotts in 1985 and 1986. List of attacks attributed to MK and compiled by the Committee for South African War Resistance (COSAWR) between 1980 and 1983. In parallel with student protests, labour unions started protest action in 1973 and 1974. After 1976 unions and workers are considered to have played an important role in the struggle against apartheid, filling the gap left by the banning of political parties. In 1979 black trade unions were legalised and could engage in collective bargaining, although strikes were still illegal. Economist Thomas Sowell wrote that basic supply and demand led to violations of Apartheid \\"on a massive scale\\" throughout the nation, simply because there were not enough white South African business owners to meet the demand for various goods and services. Large portions of the garment industry and construction of new homes, for example, were effectively owned and operated by blacks, who either worked surreptitiously or who circumvented the law with a white person as a nominal, figurehead manager.Sowell, Thomas (2004, 2009). Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One. Second Edition, NY: Basic Books. Ch. 7: The Economics of Discrimination. In 1983, anti-apartheid leaders determined to resist the tricameral parliament assembled to form the United Democratic Front (UDF) in order to coordinate anti-apartheid activism inside South Africa. The first presidents of the UDF were Archie Gumede, Oscar Mpetha and Albertina Sisulu; patrons were Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Dr Allan Boesak, Helen Joseph, and Nelson Mandela. Basing its platform on abolishing apartheid and creating a nonracial democratic South Africa, the UDF provided a legal way for domestic human rights groups and individuals of all races to organise demonstrations and campaign against apartheid inside the country. Churches and church groups also emerged as pivotal points of resistance. Church leaders were not immune to prosecution, and certain faith-based organisations were banned, but the clergy generally had more freedom to criticise the government than militant groups did. The UDF, coupled with the protection of the church, accordingly permitted a major role for Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who served both as a prominent domestic voice and international spokesperson denouncing apartheid and urging the creation of a shared nonracial state.Nelson Mandela Foundation, United Democratic Front Although the majority of whites supported apartheid, some 20 percent did not. Parliamentary opposition was galvanised by Helen Suzman, Colin Eglin and Harry Schwarz, who formed the Progressive Federal Party. Extra-parliamentary resistance was largely centred in the South African Communist Party and women's organisation the Black Sash. Women were also notable in their involvement in trade union organisations and banned political parties. The public intellectuals too, such as Nadine Gordimer the eminent author and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature (1991), vehemently opposed the Apartheid regime and accordingly bolstered the movement against it.  International relations during apartheid  = Commonwealth = South Africa's policies were subject to international scrutiny in 1960, when UK Prime Minister Harold Macmillan criticised them during his Wind of Change speech in Cape Town. Weeks later, tensions came to a head in the Sharpeville Massacre, resulting in more international condemnation. Soon afterwards, Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd announced a referendum on whether the country should become a republic. Verwoerd lowered the voting age for Whites to eighteen years of age and included Whites in South West Africa on the roll. The referendum on 5 October that year asked Whites; \\"Are you in favour of a Republic for the Union?\\", and 52 percent voted \\"Yes\\". As a consequence of this change of status, South Africa needed to reapply for continued membership of the Commonwealth, with which it had privileged trade links. India had become a republic within the Commonwealth in 1950, but it became clear that African and Asian member states would oppose South Africa due to its apartheid policies. As a result, South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth on 31 May 1961, the day that the Republic came into existence. = United Nations = The apartheid system as an issue was first formally brought to the United Nations attention, in order to advocate for the Indians residing in South Africa. On June 22 of 1946, the Indian government requested that the discriminatory treatment of Indians living in South Africa be included on the agenda of the first General Assembly session. In 1952, apartheid was again discussed in the aftermath of the Defiance Campaign, and the UN set up a task team to keep watch on the progress of apartheid and the racial state of affairs in South Africa. Although South Africa's racial policies were a cause for concern, most countries in the UN concurred that this was a domestic affair, which fell outside the UN's jurisdiction.Ampiah, Kweku (1997). The dynamics of Japan's relations with Africa: South Africa, Tanzania and Nigeria. CRC Press. p. 147. In April 1960, the UN's conservative stance on apartheid changed following the Sharpeville massacre, and the Security Council for the first time agreed on concerted action against the apartheid regime. Resolution 134 called upon the nation of South Africa to abandon its policies implementing racial discrimination. The newly founded United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid, scripted and passed Resolution 181 on August 7, 1963, which called upon all states to cease the sale and shipment of all ammunition and military vehicles to South Africa. This clause was finally declared mandatory on 4 November 1977, depriving South Africa of military aid. From 1964 onwards, the US and the UK discontinued their arms trade with South Africa. The Security Council also condemned the Soweto massacre in Resolution 392. In 1977, the voluntary UN arms embargo became mandatory with the passing of Resolution 418. In addition to isolating South Africa militarily, the United Nations General Assembly, encouraged the boycotting of oil sales to South Africa. Other actions taken by the United Nations General Assembly include the request for all nations and organisations, ‚Äúto suspend cultural, educational, sporting and other exchanges with the racist regime and with organisations or institutions in South Africa which practice apartheid‚Äù. Illustrating that over a long period of time, the United Nations was working towards isolating the state of South Africa, by putting pressure on the Apartheid regime. After much debate, by the late-1980s, the United States, the United Kingdom, and 23 other nations had passed laws placing various trade sanctions on South Africa. A disinvestment from South Africa movement in many countries was similarly widespread, with individual cities and provinces around the world implementing various laws and local regulations forbidding registered corporations under their jurisdiction from doing business with South African firms, factories, or banks. = Catholic Church = Pope John Paul II was an outspoken opponent of apartheid. In 1985, while visiting the Netherlands, he gave an impassioned speech at the International Court of Justice condemning apartheid, proclaiming that \\"no system of apartheid or separate development will ever be acceptable as a model for the relations between peoples or races.\\"Pope Attacks Apartheid in Speech at U.N. Court Los Angeles Times, 13 May 1985 In September 1988, he made a pilgrimage to countries bordering South Africa, while demonstratively avoiding South Africa itself. During his visit to Zimbabwe, he called for economic sanctions against the South African government.Pope's South Africa Visit Honours 2 Vows The New York Times, 13 May 1995 = Organisation for African Unity = The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) was created in 1963. Its primary objectives were to eradicate colonialism and improve social, political and economic situations in Africa. It censured apartheid and demanded sanctions against South Africa. African states agreed to aid the liberation movements in their fight against apartheid.Geldenhuys, Deon (1990). Isolated states: a comparative analysis. Cambridge University Press. p. 274. In 1969, fourteen nations from Central and East Africa gathered in Lusaka, Zambia, and formulated the Lusaka Manifesto, which was signed on 13 April by all of the countries in attendance except Malawi.Royal African Society (1970). African affairs, Volumes 69‚Äì70. Oxford University Press. p. 178. This manifesto was later taken on by both the OAU and the United Nations. The Lusaka Manifesto summarized the political situations of self-governing African countries, condemning racism and inequity, and calling for Black majority rule in all African nations. It did not rebuff South Africa entirely, though, adopting an appeasing manner towards the apartheid government, and even recognizing its autonomy. Although African leaders supported the emancipation of Black South Africans, they preferred this to be attained through peaceful means.Rubin, Leslie; Weinstein, Brian (1977). Introduction to African politics: a continental approach. Praeger. p. 128. South Africa's negative response to the Lusaka Manifesto and rejection of a change to its policies brought about another OAU announcement in October 1971. The Mogadishu Declaration stated that South Africa's rebuffing of negotiations meant that its Black people could only be freed through military means, and that no African state should converse with the apartheid government.Klotz, Audie (1999). Norms in International Relations: The Struggle Against Apartheid. Cornell University Press. p. 77. = Outward-looking policy = In 1966, B. J. Vorster became Prime Minister. He was not prepared to dismantle apartheid, but he did try to redress South Africa's isolation and to revitalise the country's global reputation, even those with Black majority rule in Africa. This he called his \\"Outward-Looking\\" policy. Vorster's willingness to talk to African leaders stood in contrast to Verwoerd's refusal to engage with leaders such as Abubakar Tafawa Balewa of Nigeria in 1962 and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia in 1964. In 1966, he met the heads of the neighbouring states of Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana. In 1967, he offered technological and financial aid to any African state prepared to receive it, asserting that no political strings were attached, aware that many African states needed financial aid despite their opposition to South Africa's racial policies. Many were also tied to South Africa economically because of their migrant labour population working down the South African mines. Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland remained outspoken critics of apartheid, but were dependent on South African economic assistance. Malawi was the first non-neighbouring country to accept South African aid. In 1967, the two states set out their political and economic relations. In 1969, Malawi was the only country at the assembly which did not sign the Lusaka Manifesto condemning South Africa' apartheid policy. In 1970, Malawian president Hastings Banda made his first and most successful official stopover in South Africa. Associations with Mozambique followed suit and were sustained after that country won its sovereignty in 1975. Angola was also granted South African loans. Other countries which formed relationships with South Africa were Liberia, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mauritius, Gabon, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and the Central African Republic. Although these states condemned apartheid (more than ever after South Africa's denunciation of the Lusaka Manifesto), South Africa's economic and military dominance meant that they remained dependent on South Africa to varying degrees. = Sports and culture = Beginning South Africa's isolation in sport began in the mid-1950s and increased throughout the 1960s. Apartheid forbade multiracial sport, which meant that overseas teams, by virtue of them having players of different races, could not play in South Africa. In 1956, the International Table Tennis Federation severed its ties with the all-White South African Table Tennis Union, preferring the non-racial South African Table Tennis Board. The apartheid government responded by confiscating the passports of the Board's players so that they were unable to attend international games. Isolation Verwoerd years In 1959, the non-racial South African Sports Association (SASA) was formed to secure the rights of all players on the global field. After meeting with no success in its endeavours to attain credit by collaborating with White establishments, SASA approached the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1962, calling for South Africa's expulsion from the Olympic Games. The IOC sent South Africa a caution to the effect that, if there were no changes, they would be barred from competing at the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo. The changes were initiated, and in January 1963, the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (SANROC) was set up. The Anti-Apartheid Movement persisted in its campaign for South Africa's exclusion, and the IOC acceded in barring the country from the 1964 Olympic Games. South Africa selected a multi-racial team for the next Olympic Games, and the IOC opted for incorporation in the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games. Because of protests from AAMs and African nations, however, the IOC was forced to retract the invitation. Foreign complaints about South Africa's bigoted sports brought more isolation. Racially selected New Zealand sports teams toured South Africa, until the 1970 All Blacks rugby tour allowed Maori to enter the country under the status of \\"honorary Whites\\". Huge and widespread protests occurred in New Zealand in 1981 against the Springbok tourthe government spent $8,000,000 protecting games using the army and police force. A planned All Black tour to South Africa in 1985 remobilised the New Zealand protesters and it was cancelled. A \\"rebel tour\\"not government sanctionedwent ahead in 1986, but after that sporting ties were cut, and New Zealand made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa until the end of apartheid.The 1981 Springbok rugby tourA country divided. New Zealand History Online. Vorster years On 6 September 1966, Verwoerd was fatally stabbed at Parliament House by parliamentary messenger Dimitri Tsafendas. John Vorster took office shortly after, and announced that South Africa would no longer dictate to the international community what their teams should look like. Although this reopened the gate for international sporting meets, it did not signal the end of South Africa's racist sporting policies. In 1968, Vorster went against his policy by refusing to permit Basil D'Oliveira, a Coloured South African-born cricketer, to join the English cricket team on its tour to South Africa. Vorster said that the side had been chosen only to prove a point, and not on merit. D'Oliveira was eventually included in the team as the first substitute, but the tour was cancelled. Protests against certain tours brought about the cancellation of a number of other visits, including that of an England rugby team touring South Africa in 1969/70. The first of the \\"White Bans\\" occurred in 1971 when the Chairman of the Australian Cricketing AssociationSir Don Bradmanflew to South Africa to meet Vorster. Vorster had expected Bradman to allow the tour of the Australian cricket team to go ahead, but things became heated after Bradman asked why Black sportsmen were not allowed to play cricket. Vorster stated that Blacks were intellectually inferior and had no finesse for the game. Bradmanthinking this ignorant and repugnantasked Vorster if he had heard of a man named Garry Sobers. On his return to Australia, Bradman released a short statement: \\"We will not play them until they choose a team on a non-racist basis.\\"The Day Apartheid Was Hit For Six. The Sydney Morning Herald. Bradman's views were in stark contrast to those of Australian tennis great Margaret Court, who had won the grand slam the previous year and commented about apartheid that \\"South Africans have this thing better organised than any other country, particularly America\\" and that she would \\"go back there any time.\\" In South Africa, Vorster vented his anger publicly against Bradman, while the African National Congress rejoiced. This was the first time a predominantly White nation had taken the side of multiracial sport, producing an unsettling resonance that more \\"White\\" boycotts were coming. Almost twenty years later, on his release from prison, Nelson Mandela asked a visiting Australian statesman if Donald Bradman, his childhood hero, was still alive (Bradman lived until 2001). In 1971, Vorster altered his policies even further by distinguishing multiracial from multinational sport. Multiracial sport, between teams with players of different races, remained outlawed; multinational sport, however, was now acceptable: international sides would not be subject to South Africa's racial stipulations. In 1978, Nigeria boycotted the Commonwealth Games because New Zealand's sporting contacts with the South African government were not considered to be in accordance with the 1977 Gleneagles Agreement. Nigeria also led the 32-nation boycott of the 1986 Commonwealth Games because of UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's ambivalent attitude towards sporting links with South Africa, significantly affecting the quality and profitability of the Games and thus thrusting apartheid into the international spotlight. Cultural boycott In the 1960s, the Anti-Apartheid Movements began to campaign for cultural boycotts of apartheid South Africa. Artists were requested not to present or let their works be hosted in South Africa. In 1963, 45 British writers put their signatures to an affirmation approving of the boycott, and, in 1964, American actor Marlon Brando called for a similar affirmation for films. In 1965, the Writers' Guild of Great Britain called for a proscription on the sending of films to South Africa. Over sixty American artists signed a statement against apartheid and against professional links with the state. The presentation of some South African plays in the United Kingdom and the United States was also vetoed. After the arrival of television in South Africa in 1975, the British Actors Union, Equity, boycotted the service, and no British programme concerning its associates could be sold to South Africa. Similarly, when home video grew popular in the 1980s, the Australian arm of CBS/Fox Video (now 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment) placed stickers on their VHS and Betamax cassettes which labeled exporting such cassettes to South Africa as \\"an infringement of copyright\\".https://vhscollector.com/sites/default/files/vhs/domino-principal- vhs-5-29047.jpg Sporting and cultural boycotts did not have the same impact as economic sanctions, but they did much to lift consciousness amongst normal South Africans of the global condemnation of apartheid. = Western influence = London \\"Boycott Apartheid\\" bus, 1989 While international opposition to apartheid grew, the Nordic countriesand Sweden in particularprovided both moral and financial support for the ANC.International Labour Office (1991).

In Switzerland, the Swiss-South African Association lobbied on behalf of the South African government. The Nixon Administration implemented a policy known as the Tar Baby Option, pursuant to which the US maintained close relations with the white supremacist South African government. The Reagan administration evaded international sanctions and provided diplomatic support in international forums for the South African government. The United States also increased trade with the white supremacist South Africa regime, while describing the ANC as \\"a terrorist organisation.\\"Joseba Zulaika and William Douglass, \\"Terror and Taboo\\" (Routledge, 1996), p. 12 Like the Reagan Administration, the government of Margaret Thatcher termed this policy \\"constructive engagement\\" with the apartheid government, vetoing the imposition of UN economic sanctions. U.S. government justification for supporting the Apartheid regime publicly given as a belief in \\"free trade\\" and the perception of the right-wing South African government as a bastion against Marxist forces in Southern Africa, for example, by the military intervention by the South African government in the Mozambican Civil War in support of right-wing insurgents fighting to topple the government. The U.S. and the U.K. declared the ANC a terrorist organisation, and in 1987 her spokesman, Bernard Ingham, famously said that anyone who believed that the ANC would ever form the government of South Africa was \\"living in cloud cuckoo land\\". The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative lobbying organisation, actively campaigned against divesting from South Africa throughout the 1980s.ALEC's \\"Institutional Corruption\\", From Backing Apartheid to Assault on Clean Energy, Public Sector. Democracy Now! 11 December 2013. By the late-1980s, with no sign of a political resolution in South Africa, Western patience began to run out. By 1989, a bipartisan Republican/Democratic initiative in the US favoured economic sanctions (realised as the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986), the release of Nelson Mandela and a negotiated settlement involving the ANC. Thatcher too began to take a similar line, but insisted on the suspension of the ANC's armed struggle. The UK's significant economic involvement in South Africa may have provided some leverage with the South African government, with both the UK and the US applying pressure and pushing for negotiations. However, neither the UK nor the US was willing to apply economic pressure upon their multinational interests in South Africa, such as the mining company Anglo American. Although a high-profile compensation claim against these companies was thrown out of court in 2004, the US Supreme Court in May 2008 upheld an appeal court ruling allowing another lawsuit that seeks damages of more than US$400 billion from major international companies which are accused of aiding South Africa's apartheid system. = Impact of the Cold War = \\"Total Onslaught\\" Apartheid-era propaganda leaflet issued to South African military personnel in the 1980s. The pamphlet decries \\"Russian colonialism and oppression\\". During the 1950s, South African military strategy was decisively shaped by fears of communist espionage and a conventional Soviet threat to the strategic Cape trade route between the south Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The apartheid government supported the US-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as well as its policy of regional containment against Soviet-backed regimes and insurgencies worldwide. By the late-1960s, the rise of Soviet client states on the African continent, as well as Soviet aid for militant anti-apartheid movements, was considered one of the primary external threats to the apartheid system. South African officials frequently accused domestic opposition groups of being communist proxies. For its part, the Soviet Union viewed South Africa as a bastion of neocolonialism and a regional Western ally, which helped fuel its support for various anti-apartheid causes. From 1973 onwards, much of South Africa's white population increasingly looked upon their country as a bastion of the free world besieged militarily, politically, and culturally by Communism and radical black nationalism. The apartheid government perceived itself as being locked in a proxy struggle with the Warsaw Pact and by implication, armed wings of black nationalist forces such as Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) and the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), which often received Soviet arms and training. This was described as \\"Total Onslaught\\". =Israeli arms sales= Soviet support for militant anti-apartheid movements worked in the government's favour, as its claim to be reacting in opposition to aggressive communist expansion gained greater plausibility, and helped it justify its own domestic militarisation methods, known as \\"Total Strategy\\". Total Strategy involved building up a formidable conventional military and counter-intelligence capability. It was formulated on counter- revolutionary tactics as espoused by noted French tactician Andr√© Beaufre. Considerable effort was devoted towards circumventing international arms sanctions, and the government even went so far as to develop nuclear weapons,Von Wielligh, N. & von Wielligh-Steyn, L. (2015). The Bomb ‚Äì South Africa‚Äôs Nuclear Weapons Programme. Pretoria: Litera. allegedly with covert assistance from Israel. In 2010, The Guardian released South African government documents that revealed an Israeli offer to sell the apartheid regime nuclear weapons. Israel denied these allegations and claimed that the documents were minutes from a meeting which did not indicate any concrete offer for a sale of nuclear weapons. Shimon Peres said that The Guardians article was based on \\"selective interpretation...and not on concrete facts.\\" As a result of \\"Total Strategy\\", South African society became increasingly militarised. Many domestic civil organisations were modelled upon military structures, and military virtues such as discipline, patriotism, and loyalty were highly regarded. In 1968, national service for White South African men lasted nine months at minimum, and they could be called up for reserve duty into their late-middle age if necessary. The length of national service was gradually extended to twelve months in 1972 and twenty-four months in 1978. At state schools, white male students were organised into military-style formations and drilled as cadets or as participants in a civil defence or \\"Youth Preparedness\\" curriculum. Compulsory military education and in some cases, paramilitary training was introduced for all older white male students at state schools in three South African provinces. These programmes presided over the construction of bomb shelters at schools and drills aimed at simulating mock insurgent raids. From the late-1970s to the late-1980s, defence budgets in South Africa were raised exponentially. In 1975, Israeli defense minister Shimon Peres signed a security pact with South African defence minister P.W. Botha that led to $200 million in arms deals. In 1988, Israeli arm sales to South Africa totaled over $1.4 billion. Covert operations focused on espionage and domestic counter-subversion became common, the number of special forces units swelled, and the South African Defence Force (SADF) had amassed enough sophisticated conventional weaponry to pose a serious threat to the \\"front-line states\\", a regional alliance of neighbouring countries opposed to apartheid.  Foreign military operations  South African paratroops on a raid in Angola, 1980s Total Strategy was advanced in the context of MK, PLAN, and Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA) guerrilla raids into South Africa or against South African targets in South West Africa; frequent South African reprisal attacks on these movements' external bases in Angola, Zambia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and elsewhere, often involving collateral damage to foreign infrastructure and civilian populations; and periodic complaints brought before the international community about South African violations of its neighbours' sovereignty. The apartheid government made judicious use of extraterritorial operations to eliminate its military and political opponents, arguing that neighbouring states, including their civilian populations, which hosted, tolerated on their soil, or otherwise sheltered anti-apartheid insurgent groups could not evade responsibility for provoking retaliatory strikes. While it did focus on militarising the borders and sealing up its domestic territory against insurgent raids, it also relied heavily on an aggressive preemptive and counter-strike strategy, which fulfilled a preventive and deterrent purpose. The reprisals which occurred beyond South Africa's borders involved not only hostile states, but neutral and sympathetic governments as well, often forcing them to react against their will and interests. External South African military operations were aimed at eliminating the training facilities, safehouses, infrastructure, equipment, and manpower of the insurgents. However, their secondary objective was to dissuade neighbouring states from offering sanctuary to MK, PLAN, APLA, and similar organisations. This was accomplished by deterring the supportive foreign population from cooperating with infiltration and thus undermining the insurgents' external sanctuary areas. It would also send a clear message to the host government that collaborating with insurgent forces involved potentially high costs. The scale and intensity of foreign operations varied, and ranged from small special forces units carrying out raids on locations across the border which served as bases for insurgent infiltration to major conventional offensives involving armour, artillery, and aircraft. Actions such as Operation Protea in 1981 and Operation Askari in 1983 involved both full scale conventional warfare and a counter-insurgency reprisal operation. The insurgent bases were usually situated near military installations of the host government, so that SADF retaliatory strikes hit those facilities as well and attracted international attention and condemnation of what was perceived as aggression against the armed forces of another sovereign state. This would inevitably result in major engagements, in which the SADF's expeditionary units would have to contend with the firepower of the host government's forces. Intensive conventional warfare of this nature carried the risk of severe casualties among white soldiers, which had to be kept to a minimum for political reasons. There were also high economic and diplomatic costs associated with openly deploying large numbers of South African troops into another country. Furthermore, military involvement on that scale had the potential to evolve into wider conflict situations, in which South Africa became entangled. For example, South Africa's activities in Angola, initially limited to containing PLAN, later escalated to direct involvement in the Angolan Civil War. As it became clearer that full-scale conventional operations could not effectively fulfill the requirements of a regional counter-insurgency effort, South Africa turned to a number of alternative methods. Retributive artillery bombardments were the least sophisticated means of reprisal against insurgent attacks. Between 1978 and 1979 the SADF directed artillery fire against locations in Angola and Zambia from which insurgent rockets were suspected to have been launched. This precipitated several artillery duels with the Zambian Army. Special forces raids were launched to harass PLAN and MK by liquidating prominent members of those movements, destroying their offices and safehouses, and seizing valuable records stored at these sites. One example was the Gaborone Raid, carried out in 1985, during which a South African special forces team crossed the border into Botswana and demolished four suspected MK safe houses, severely damaging another four. Other types of special forces operations included the sabotage of economic infrastructure. The SADF sabotaged infrastructure being used for the insurgents' war effort; for example, port facilities in southern Angola's Mo√ß√¢medes District, where Soviet arms were frequently offloaded for PLAN, as well as the railway line which facilitated their transport to PLAN headquarters in Lubango, were common targets. Sabotage was also used as a pressure tactic when South Africa was negotiating with a host government to cease providing sanctuary to insurgent forces, as in the case of Operation Argon. Successful sabotage actions of high-profile economic targets undermined a country's ability to negotiate from a position of strength, and made it likelier to accede to South African demands rather than risk the expense of further destruction and war. Also noteworthy were South African transnational espionage efforts, which included covert assassinations, kidnappings, and attempts to disrupt the overseas influence of anti-apartheid organisations. South African military intelligence agents were known to have abducted and killed anti-apartheid activists and others suspected of having ties to MK in London and Brussels.Purkitt, Helen E.; Burgess, Stephen Franklin (2005). South Africa's weapons of mass destruction. Indiana University Press. p. 152.Watson, Wendy (2007). Brick by brick: an informal guide to the history of South Africa. New Africa Books.  State security  During the 1980s the government, led by P.W. Botha, became increasingly preoccupied with security. It set up a powerful state security apparatus to \\"protect\\" the state against an anticipated upsurge in political violence that the reforms were expected to trigger. The 1980s became a period of considerable political unrest, with the government becoming increasingly dominated by Botha's circle of generals and police chiefs (known as securocrats), who managed the various States of Emergencies.Fox, William; Fourie, Marius; Van Wyk, Belinda (1998). Police Management in South Africa. Juta and Company Limited. p. 167. Botha's years in power were marked also by numerous military interventions in the states bordering South Africa, as well as an extensive military and political campaign to eliminate SWAPO in Namibia. Within South Africa, meanwhile, vigorous police action and strict enforcement of security legislation resulted in hundreds of arrests and bans, and an effective end to the African National Congress' sabotage campaign. The government punished political offenders brutally. 40,000 people annually were subjected to whipping as a form of punishment.Anzovin, Steven (1987). South Africa: apartheid and divestiture. H.W. Wilson Co. p. 80. . The vast majority had committed political offences and were lashed ten times for their crime.Foster, Don; Davis, Dennis (1987). Detention & torture in South Africa: psychological, legal & historical studies. Currey. p. 18. . If convicted of treason, a person could be hanged, and the government executed numerous political offenders in this way. As the 1980s progressed, more and more anti-apartheid organisations were formed and affiliated with the UDF. Led by the Reverend Allan Boesak and Albertina Sisulu, the UDF called for the government to abandon its reforms and instead abolish the apartheid system and eliminate the homelands completely. = State of emergency = Serious political violence was a prominent feature from 1985‚Äì89, as Black townships became the focus of the struggle between anti- apartheid organisations and the Botha government. Throughout the 1980s, township people resisted apartheid by acting against the local issues that faced their particular communities. The focus of much of this resistance was against the local authorities and their leaders, who were seen to be supporting the government. By 1985, it had become the ANC's aim to make Black townships \\"ungovernable\\" (a term later replaced by \\"people's power\\") by means of rent boycotts and other militant action. Numerous township councils were overthrown or collapsed, to be replaced by unofficial popular organisations, often led by militant youth. People's courts were set up, and residents accused of being government agents were dealt extreme and occasionally lethal punishments. Black town councillors and policemen, and sometimes their families, were attacked with petrol bombs, beaten, and murdered by necklacing, where a burning tyre was placed around the victim's neck, after they were restrained by wrapping their wrists with barbed wire. This signature act of torture and murder was embraced by the ANC and its leaders. On 20 July 1985, Botha declared a State of Emergency in 36 magisterial districts. Areas affected were the Eastern Cape, and the PWV region (\\"Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging\\").Pomeroy, William J. (1986). Apartheid, imperialism, and African freedom. International Publishers. p. 226. . Three months later, the Western Cape was included. An increasing number of organisations were banned or listed (restricted in some way); many individuals had restrictions such as house arrest imposed on them. During this state of emergency, about 2,436 people were detained under the Internal Security Act.Legum, Colin (1989). Africa contemporary record: annual survey and documents, Volume 20. Africana Pub. Co. p. 668. This act gave police and the military sweeping powers. The government could implement curfews controlling the movement of people. The president could rule by decree without referring to the constitution or to parliament. It became a criminal offence to threaten someone verbally or possess documents that the government perceived to be threatening, to advise anyone to stay away from work or to oppose the government, and to disclose the name of anyone arrested under the State of Emergency until the government released that name, with up to ten years' imprisonment for these offences. Detention without trial became a common feature of the government's reaction to growing civil unrest and by 1988, 30,000 people had been detained.McKendrick, Brian; Hoffmann, Wilman (1990). People and violence in South Africa. Oxford University Press. p. 62. The media was censored, thousands were arrested and many were interrogated and tortured.Blond, Rebecca; Fitzpatrick, Mary (2004). South Africa, Lesotho & Swaziland. Lonely Planet. p. 40. On 12 June 1986, four days before the tenth anniversary of the Soweto uprising, the state of emergency was extended to cover the whole country. The government amended the Public Security Act, including the right to declare \\"unrest\\" areas, allowing extraordinary measures to crush protests in these areas. Severe censorship of the press became a dominant tactic in the government's strategy and television cameras were banned from entering such areas. The state broadcaster, the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), provided propaganda in support of the government. Media opposition to the system increased, supported by the growth of a pro-ANC underground press within South Africa. In 1987, the State of Emergency was extended for another two years. Meanwhile, about 200,000 members of the National Union of Mineworkers commenced the longest strike (three weeks) in South African history. The year 1988 saw the banning of the activities of the UDF and other anti-apartheid organisations. Much of the violence in the late-1980s and early-1990s was directed at the government, but a substantial amount was between the residents themselves. Many died in violence between members of Inkatha and the UDF-ANC faction. It was later proven that the government manipulated the situation by supporting one side or the other whenever it suited them. Government agents assassinated opponents within South Africa and abroad; they undertook cross-border army and air-force attacks on suspected ANC and PAC bases. The ANC and the PAC in return detonated bombs at restaurants, shopping centres and government buildings such as magistrates courts. Between 1960‚Äì1994, according to statistics from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the Inkatha Freedom Party was responsible for 4,500 deaths, South African security forces were responsible for 2,700 deaths and the ANC was responsible for 1,300 deaths.Volume Five ‚Äì Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa Report The state of emergency continued until 1990 when it was lifted by State President F.W. de Klerk.  Final years of apartheid  = Factors =  Institutional racism  Apartheid developed from the racism of colonial factions and due to South Africa's \\"unique industrialisation\\".Nigel, Worden, The making of modern South Africa: Conquest, Segregation and Apartheid, 3rd ed. (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2000) p. 3. The policies of industrialisation led to the segregation of and classing of people, which was \\"specifically developed to nurture early industry such as mining\\". Cheap labour was the basis of the economy and this was taken from what the state classed as peasant groups and the migrants.Philip Boner, Peter, Delius, Deborah, Posel, \\"The Shaping of Apartheid, contradiction, continuity and popular struggle\\", The Worlds Knowledge, (1993) pp. 1‚Äì47 (p. 6.) Furthermore, Philip Bonner highlights the \\"contradictory economic effects\\" as the economy did not have a manufacturing sector, therefore promoting short term profitability but limiting labour productivity and the size of local markets. This also led to its collapse as \\"Clarkes emphasises the economy could not provide and compete with foreign rivals as they failed to master cheap labour and complex chemistry\\".Philip Boner, Peter, Delius, Deborah, Posel, \\"The Shaping of Apartheid, contradiction, continuity and popular struggle\\", The Worlds Knowledge, (1993) pp. 1‚Äì47 (p. 7.)  Economic contradictions  The contradictions in the traditionally capitalist economy of the apartheid state led to considerable debate about racial policy, and division and conflicts in the central state.Paul, Maylam, \\"The Rise and Decline of Urban Apartheid in South Africa\\", African Affairs, 89.354(1990) pp. 57‚Äì84 (p. 54.) To a large extent, the political ideology of apartheid had emerged from the colonisation of Africa by European powers which institutionalised racial discrimination and exercised a paternal philosophy of \\"civilising inferior natives.\\" Some scholars have argued that this can be reflected in Afrikaner Calvinism, with its parallel traditions of racialism;Dubow, Saul, \\"Afrikaner Nationalism, Apartheid and the conceptualisation of 'Race, The Journal of African History, 33(1992) pp. 209‚Äì237 (pp. 209, 211) for example, as early as 1933; the executive council of the Broederbond formulated a recommendation for mass segregation.  Western influence  Anti-apartheid protest at South Africa House in London, 1989 External Western influence, arising from European experiences in colonisation, may be seen as a factor which greatly influenced political attitudes and ideology. Late twentieth-century South Africa was cited as an \\"unreconstructed example of western civilisation twisted by racism\\".L.H, Gann, \\"Apartheids Genesis 1935‚Äì1962\\", Business Library, (1994) pp. 1‚Äì6. (p. 1.) In the 1960s, South Africa experienced economic growth second only to that of Japan. Trade with Western countries grew, and investment from the United States, France, and the United Kingdom poured in. In 1974, resistance to apartheid was encouraged by Portuguese withdrawal from Mozambique and Angola, after the 1974 Carnation Revolution. South African troops withdrew from Angola early in 1976, failing to prevent the MPLA from gaining power there, and Black students in South Africa celebrated. The Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith, signed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Harry Schwarz in 1974, enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all. Its purpose was to provide a blueprint for South Africa by consent and racial peace in a multi-racial society, stressing opportunity for all, consultation, the federal concept, and a Bill of Rights. It caused a split in the United Party that ultimately realigned oppositional politics in South Africa with the formation of the Progressive Federal Party in 1977. The Declaration was the first of several such joint agreements by acknowledged Black and White political leaders in South Africa. In 1978, the National Party Defence Minister, Pieter Willem Botha, became Prime Minister. His white minority regime worried about Soviet aid to revolutionaries in South Africa at the same time that South African economic growth had slowed. The South African Government noted that it was spending too much money to maintain segregated homelands created for Blacks, and the homelands were proving to be uneconomical. Nor was maintaining Blacks as third-class citizens working well. Black labour remained vital to the economy, and illegal Black labour unions were flourishing. Many Blacks remained too poor to contribute significantly to the economy through their purchasing poweralthough they composed more than 70% of the population. Botha's regime feared that an antidote was needed to prevent the Blacks' being attracted to Communism. In July 1979, the Nigerian Government alleged that the Shell-BP Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) was selling Nigerian oil to South Africa, though there was little evidence or commercial logic for such sales. Weymouth Genova covers the possibility of Nigerian oil going to South Africa in detail from page 113. Heavily laden tankers have to respect the ocean currents which means they travel clockwise around Africa; oil for South Africa would likely come from the Middle East rather than West Africa. Nigeria had been taking over other oil marketing companies to reduce price differentials across the country; they needed to fill a budget shortfall due to low oil prices and had a history of disputes with BP and the UK Government, so BP assets were seized when Shell's stake in SPDC was not. The alleged sanctions-breaking was used to justify the seizure of some of BP's assets in Nigeria including their stake in SPDC, although it appears the real reasons were economic nationalism and domestic politics ahead of the Nigerian elections. Many South Africans attended schools in Nigeria, and Nelson Mandela acknowledged the role of Nigeria in the struggle against apartheid on several occasions. In the 1980s, anti-apartheid movements in the United States and Europe were gaining support for boycotts against South Africa, for the withdrawal of US companies from South Africa, and for release of imprisoned Nelson Mandela. South Africa was sinking to the bottom of the international community. Investment in South Africa was ending and an active policy of disinvestment had begun. = Tricameral parliament = In the early-1980s, Botha's National Party government started to recognise the inevitability of the need to reform the apartheid system.Knox, Colin; Quirk, P√°draic (2000). Peacebuilding in Northern Ireland, Israel and South Africa: transition, transformation and reconciliation. Palgrave Macmillan. p. 151. Early reforms were driven by a combination of internal violence, international condemnation, changes within the National Party's constituency, and changing demographicswhites constituted only 16% of the total population, in comparison to 20% fifty years earlier.Beinart, William (2001). Twentieth-century South Africa. Oxford University Press. p. 202. . In 1983, a new constitution was passed implementing what was called the Tricameral Parliament, giving Coloureds and Indians voting rights and parliamentary representation in separate housesthe House of Assembly (178 members) for Whites, the House of Representatives (85 members) for Coloureds and the House of Delegates (45 members) for Indians.Taylor & Francis Group (2004). Europa World Year Book 2, Book 2. Taylor & Francis. p. 3841. Each House handled laws pertaining to its racial group's \\"own affairs\\", including health, education and other community issues.Taylor, Paul (23 December 1993). \\"S. Africa Approves Charter; White-Led Parliament Votes for Constitution Canceling Its Powers.\\" The Washington Post. All laws relating to \\"general affairs\\" (matters such as defence, industry, taxation and Black affairs) were handled by a Cabinet made up of representatives from all three houses. However, the White chamber had a large majority on this Cabinet, ensuring that effective control of the country remained in the hands of the White minority.Wople, Harold (1990). Race, class & the apartheid state. Africa World Press. p. 93. .Marais, D. (1989). South Africa: constitutional development, a multi-disciplinary approach. Southern Book Publishers. p. 258. . Blacks, although making up the majority of the population, were excluded from representation; they remained nominal citizens of their homelands.L√∂tter, Hennie P. P. (1997). Injustice, violence and peace: the case of South Africa. Rodopi. p. 49. . The first Tricameral elections were largely boycotted by Coloured and Indian voters, amid widespread rioting.\\"Cops fight crowds at S. Africa elections.\\" Philadelphia Daily News. 28 August 1984. = Reforms and contact with the ANC under Botha = Concerned over the popularity of Mandela, Botha denounced him as an arch-Marxist committed to violent revolution, but to appease Black opinion and nurture Mandela as a benevolent leader of Blacks, the government transferred him from the maximum security Robben Island to the lower security Pollsmoor Prison just outside Cape Town; where prison life was more comfortable for him. The government allowed Mandela more visitors, including visits and interviews by foreigners, to let the world know that he was being treated well. Black homelands were declared nation-states and pass laws were abolished. Black labour unions were legitimised, the government recognised the right of Blacks to live in urban areas permanently and gave Blacks property rights there. Interest was expressed in rescinding the law against interracial marriage and also rescinding the law against sexual relations between different races, which was under ridicule abroad. The spending for Black schools increased, to one- seventh of what was spent per white child, up from on one-sixteenth in 1968. At the same time, attention was given to strengthening the effectiveness of the police apparatus. In January 1985, Botha addressed the government's House of Assembly and stated that the government was willing to release Mandela on condition that Mandela pledge opposition to acts of violence to further political objectives. Mandela's reply was read in public by his daughter Zinzihis first words distributed publicly since his sentence to prison twenty- one years before. Mandela described violence as the responsibility of the apartheid regime and said that with democracy there would be no need for violence. The crowd listening to the reading of his speech erupted in cheers and chants. This response helped to further elevate Mandela's status in the eyes of those, both internationally and domestically, who opposed apartheid. Between 1986‚Äì88, some petty apartheid laws were repealed, along with the pass laws. Botha told White South Africans to \\"adapt or die\\"South Africa: Adapt or Die. Time. and twice he wavered on the eve of what were billed as \\"rubicon\\" announcements of substantial reforms, although on both occasions he backed away from substantial changes. Ironically, these reforms served only to trigger intensified political violence through the remainder of the 1980s as more communities and political groups across the country joined the resistance movement. Botha's government stopped short of substantial reforms, such as lifting the ban on the ANC, PAC and SACP and other liberation organisations, releasing political prisoners, or repealing the foundation laws of grand apartheid. The government's stance was that they would not contemplate negotiating until those organisations \\"renounced violence\\". By 1987, South Africa's economy was growing at one of the lowest rates in the world, and the ban on South African participation in international sporting events was frustrating many whites in South Africa. Examples of African states with Black leaders and White minorities existed in Kenya and Zimbabwe. Whispers of South Africa one day having a Black President sent more hardline whites into supporting right-wing political parties. Mandela was moved to a four-bedroom house of his own, with a swimming pool and shaded by fir trees, on a prison farm just outside of Cape Town. He had an unpublicised meeting with Botha. Botha impressed Mandela by walking forward, extending his hand and pouring Mandela's tea. The two had a friendly discussion, with Mandela comparing the African National Congress' rebellion with that of the Afrikaner rebellion and talking about everyone being brothers. A number of clandestine meetings were held between the ANC-in-exile and various sectors of the internal struggle, such as women and educationalists. More overtly, a group of White intellectuals met the ANC in Senegal for talks known as the Dakar Conference. = Presidency of F. W. de Klerk = de Klerk and Mandela in Davos, 1992 Early in 1989, Botha suffered a stroke; he was prevailed upon to resign in February 1989.Roherty, James Michael (1992). State security in South Africa: civil- military relations under P.W. Botha. M.E. Sharpe. p. 23. . He was succeeded as president later that year by F.W. de Klerk. Despite his initial reputation as a conservative, de Klerk moved decisively towards negotiations to end the political stalemate in the country. Prior to his term in office, F.W. de Klerk had already experienced political success as a result of the power base he had built in the Transvaal. During this time, F.W. de Klerk served as chairman to the provincial National Party, which was in favour of the Apartheid regime. The transition of de Klerk's ideology regarding apartheid is seen clearly in his opening address to parliament on 2 February 1990. F.W. de Klerk announced that he would repeal discriminatory laws and lift the 30-year ban on leading anti-apartheid groups such as the African National Congress, the Pan Africanist Congress, the South African Communist Party (SACP) and the United Democratic Front. The Land Act was brought to an end. F.W. de Klerk also made his first public commitment to release Nelson Mandela, to return to press freedom and to suspend the death penalty. Media restrictions were lifted and political prisoners not guilty of common law crimes were released. On 11 February 1990, Nelson Mandela was released from Victor Verster Prison after more than 27 years behind bars. Having been instructed by the UN Security Council to end its long-standing involvement in South West Africa/Namibia, and in the face of military stalemate in Southern Angola, and an escalation in the size and cost of the combat with the Cubans, the Angolans, and SWAPO forces and the growing cost of the border war, South Africa negotiated a change of control; Namibia became independent on 21 March 1990. = Negotiations = Apartheid was dismantled in a series of negotiations from 1990‚Äì91, culminating in a transitional period which resulted in the country's 1994 general election, the first in South Africa held with universal suffrage. In 1990, negotiations were earnestly begun, with two meetings between the government and the ANC. The purpose of the negotiations was to pave the way for talks towards a peaceful transition towards majority rule. These meetings were successful in laying down the preconditions for negotiations, despite the considerable tensions still abounding within the country. Apartheid legislation was abolished in 1991. At the first meeting, the NP and ANC discussed the conditions for negotiations to begin. The meeting was held at Groote Schuur, the President's official residence. They released the Groote Schuur Minute, which said that before negotiations commenced political prisoners would be freed and all exiles allowed to return. There were fears that the change of power would be violent. To avoid this, it was essential that a peaceful resolution between all parties be reached. In December 1991, the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) began negotiations on the formation of a multiracial transitional government and a new constitution extending political rights to all groups. CODESA adopted a Declaration of Intent and committed itself to an \\"undivided South Africa\\". Reforms and negotiations to end apartheid led to a backlash among the right-wing White opposition, leading to the Conservative Party winning a number of by-elections against NP candidates. De Klerk responded by calling a Whites-only referendum in March 1992 to decide whether negotiations should continue. 68% voted in favour, and the victory instilled in de Klerk and the government a lot more confidence, giving the NP a stronger position in negotiations. When negotiations resumed in May 1992, under the tag of CODESA II, stronger demands were made. The ANC and the government could not reach a compromise on how power should be shared during the transition to democracy. The NP wanted to retain a strong position in a transitional government, and the power to change decisions made by parliament. Persistent violence added to the tension during the negotiations. This was due mostly to the intense rivalry between the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the ANC and the eruption of some traditional tribal and local rivalries between the Zulu and Xhosa historical tribal affinities, especially in the Southern Natal provinces. Although Mandela and Buthelezi met to settle their differences, they could not stem the violence. One of the worst cases of ANC-IFP violence was the Boipatong massacre of 17 June 1992, when 200 IFP militants attacked the Gauteng township of Boipatong, killing 45. Witnesses said that the men had arrived in police vehicles, supporting claims that elements within the police and army contributed to the ongoing violence. Subsequent judicial inquiries found the evidence of the witnesses to be unreliable or discredited, and that there was no evidence of National Party or police involvement in the massacre. When de Klerk visited the scene of the incident he was initially warmly welcomed, but he was suddenly confronted by a crowd of protesters brandishing stones and placards. The motorcade sped from the scene as police tried to hold back the crowd. Shots were fired by the police, and the PAC stated that three of its supporters had been gunned down. Nonetheless, the Boipatong massacre offered the ANC a pretext to engage in brinkmanship. Mandela argued that de Klerk, as head of state, was responsible for bringing an end to the bloodshed. He also accused the South African police of inciting the ANC-IFP violence. This formed the basis for ANC's withdrawal from the negotiations, and the CODESA forum broke down completely at this stage. The Bisho massacre on 7 September 1992 brought matters to a head. The Ciskei Defence Force killed 29 people and injured 200 when they opened fire on ANC marchers demanding the reincorporation of the Ciskei homeland into South Africa. In the aftermath, Mandela and de Klerk agreed to meet to find ways to end the spiralling violence. This led to a resumption of negotiations. Right-wing violence also added to the hostilities of this period. The assassination of Chris Hani on 10 April 1993 threatened to plunge the country into chaos. Hani, the popular General Secretary of the South African Communist Party (SACP), was assassinated in 1993 in Dawn Park in Johannesburg by Janusz Walu≈õ, an anti- Communist Polish refugee who had close links to the White nationalist Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB). Hani enjoyed widespread support beyond his constituency in the SACP and ANC and had been recognised as a potential successor to Mandela; his death brought forth protests throughout the country and across the international community, but ultimately proved a turning point, after which the main parties pushed for a settlement with increased determination. On 25 June 1993, the AWB used an armoured vehicle to crash through the doors of the Kempton Park World Trade Centre where talks were still going ahead under the Negotiating Council, though this did not derail the process. In addition to the continuing \\"black-on-black\\" violence, there were a number of attacks on white civilians by the PAC's military wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA). The PAC was hoping to strengthen their standing by attracting the support of the angry, impatient youth. In the St James Church massacre on 25 July 1993, members of the APLA opened fire in a church in Cape Town, killing 11 members of the congregation and wounding 58. In 1993, de Klerk and Mandela were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \\"for their work for the peaceful termination of the apartheid regime, and for laying the foundations for a new democratic South Africa\\". Violence persisted right up to the 1994 general election. Lucas Mangope, leader of the Bophuthatswana homeland, declared that it would not take part in the elections. It had been decided that, once the temporary constitution had come into effect, the homelands would be incorporated into South Africa, but Mangope did not want this to happen. There were strong protests against his decision, leading to a coup d'√©tat in Bophuthatswana on 10 March that deposed Mangope, despite the intervention of white right-wingers hoping to maintain him in power. Three AWB militants were killed during this intervention, and harrowing images were shown on national television and in newspapers across the world. Two days before the election, a car bomb exploded in Johannesburg, killing nine people. The day before the elections, another one went off, injuring 13. At midnight on 26‚Äì27 April 1994 the old flag was lowered, and the old (now co-official) national anthem Die Stem (\\"The Call\\") was sung, followed by the raising of the new rainbow flag and singing of the other co-official anthem, Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika (\\"God Bless Africa\\"). = 1994 election = The new multicoloured flag of South Africa adopted in 1994 to mark the end of Apartheid The election was held on 27 April 1994 and went off peacefully throughout the country as 20,000,000 South Africans cast their votes. There was some difficulty in organising the voting in rural areas, but people waited patiently for many hours to vote amidst a palpable feeling of goodwill. An extra day was added to give everyone the chance. International observers agreed that the elections were free and fair.Deegan, Heather (2001). The politics of the new South Africa: apartheid and after. Pearson Education. p. 194. . The European Union's report on the election compiled at the end of May 1994, published two years after the election, criticised the Independent Electoral Commission's lack of preparedness for the polls, the shortages of voting materials at many voting stations, and the absence of effective safeguards against fraud in the counting process. In particular, it expressed disquiet that \\"no international observers had been allowed to be present at the crucial stage of the count when party representatives negotiated over disputed ballots.\\" This meant that both the electorate and the world were \\"simply left to guess at the way the final result was achieved.\\"Jeffery, A. People's War: New Light on the Struggle for South Africa. Jonathan Ball. The ANC won 62.65% of the vote, less than the 66.7 percent that would have allowed it to rewrite the constitution. 252 of the 400 seats went to members of the African National Congress. The NP captured most of the White and Coloured votes and became the official opposition party. As well as deciding the national government, the election decided the provincial governments, and the ANC won in seven of the nine provinces, with the NP winning in the Western Cape and the IFP in KwaZulu-Natal. On 10 May 1994, Mandela was sworn in as the new President of South Africa. The Government of National Unity was established, its cabinet made up of 12 ANC representatives, six from the NP, and three from the IFP. Thabo Mbeki and de Klerk were made deputy presidents. The anniversary of the elections, 27 April, is celebrated as a public holiday known as Freedom Day.  Contrition  The following individuals, who had previously supported apartheid, made public apologies: * F. W. de Klerk: \\"I apologise in my capacity as leader of the NP to the millions who suffered wrenching disruption of forced removals; who suffered the shame of being arrested for pass law offences; who over the decades suffered the indignities and humiliation of racial discrimination.\\"De Klerk apologises again for apartheid.

Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  International legal, political and social uses of the term  The South African experience has given rise to the term \\"apartheid\\" being used in a number of contexts other than the South African system of racial segregation. For example: The \\"crime of apartheid\\" is defined in international law, including in the 2007 law that created the International Criminal Court (ICC), which names it as a crime against humanity. Even before the creation of the ICC, the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid of the United Nations, which came into force in 1976, enshrined into law the \\"crime of apartheid.\\" The term apartheid has been co-opted by Palestinian and Anti-Zionist organisations, referring to occupation in the West Bank, legal treatment of illegal settlements and the West Bank barrier. Social apartheid is segregation on the basis of class or economic status. For example, social apartheid in Brazil refers to the various aspects of economic inequality in Brazil. Social apartheid may fall into various categories. Economic and social discrimination because of gender is sometimes referred to as gender apartheid. Separation of people according to their religion, whether pursuant to official laws or pursuant to social expectations, is sometimes referred to as religious apartheid. The treatment of non-Muslims and women by the Saudi rulers has been called apartheid. The concept in occupational therapy that individuals, groups and communities can be deprived of meaningful and purposeful activity through segregation due to social, political, economic factors and for social status reasons, such as race, disability, age, gender, sexuality, religious preference, political preference, or creed, or due to war conditions, is sometimes known as occupational apartheid. A 2007 book by Harriet A. Washington on the history of medical experimentation on African Americans is entitled medical apartheid. The disproportionate management and control of the world's economy and resources by countries and companies of the Global North, referred to as global apartheid. A related phenomenon is technological apartheid, a term used to describe the denial of modern technologies to Third World or developing nations. The last two examples use the term \\"apartheid\\" less literally since they are centered on relations between countries, not on disparate treatment of social populations within a country or political jurisdiction.

The disease spreads from one animal to another by contact with infected feces or ingestion of infected tissue. Diarrhea, which may become bloody in severe cases, is the primary symptom. Most animals infected with coccidia are asymptomatic, but young or immunocompromised animals may suffer severe symptoms and death. While coccidia can infect a wide variety of animals, including humans, birds, and livestock, they are usually species-specific. One well-known exception is toxoplasmosis caused by Toxoplasma gondii. Humans may first encounter coccidia when they acquire a dog, cat, or avian that is infected. Other than T. gondii, the infectious organisms are canine and feline-specific and are not contagious to humans, unlike the zoonotic diseases. Coccidia in dogs Puppies are frequently infected with coccidia from the feces of their mother, and are more likely to develop coccidiosis due to their undeveloped immune systems. Stress can trigger symptoms in susceptible animals. Symptoms in young dogs include diarrhea with mucus and blood, poor appetite, vomiting, and dehydration. Untreated the disease can be fatal. They can also show signs of aggressive humping or sexual activity during this time. Treatment is routine and effective. Diagnosis is made by low-powered microscopic examination of the feces, which is generally replete with oocysts. If found in feces, the affected animal must go through months of treatment. Readily available drugs eliminate the protozoa or reduce them enough that the animal's immune system can clear the infection. Permanent damage to the gastrointestinal system is rare, and a dog will usually suffer no long-lasting negative effects. It is important too, however, to keep track of your dog's movements and actions. Coccidia in chickens Coccidiosis is a significant disease for chickens, especially affecting the young chicks. It can be fatal or leave the bird with compromised digestion. There are chick feed mixes that contain a coccidiostat to manage exposure levels and control disease. In an outbreak, coccidiocidal medications are given. Examples are toltrazuril (Baycox) or amprolium. After multiple infections, surviving chickens become resistant to the coccidia. Coccidia in cattle Coccidiosis (in cattle also known as Eimeriosis) is one of the most important diseases in calves and youngstock both under housing conditions and when grazing. Symptoms are generally caused by the species Eimeria zuernii and Eimeria bovis and include loss of appetite, fatigue, dehydration, and watery, sometimes bloody, diarrhea. Outbreaks are known to occur in cattle herds. The parasite can infect all animals on the farm and in some countries the parasite is present on all farms. Coccidiosis affects the growth and sometimes survival of the calves and consequently affect the production and the profitability of cattle livestock production. Coccidia in goats Coccidiosis is also present in goats, and is the largest cause of diarrhea in young goats. It can also greatly affect sexual reproduction of goats. Genera and species that cause coccidiosis *Genus Isospora is the most common cause of intestinal coccidiosis in dogs and cats. Species of Isospora are host-specific, infecting only one species. Species that infect dogs include I. canis, I. ohioensis, I. burrowsi, and I. neorivolta. Species that infect cats include I. felis and I. rivolta. The most common symptom is diarrhea. Sulfonamides are the most common treatment. *Genus Eimeria affects birds such as poultry and mammals such as cattle and rabbits. Species include E. tenella, E. brunetti, E. necatrix, and E. acervulina. Sulfonamides are effective. *Genus Cryptosporidium contains two species known to cause cryptosporidiosis, C. parvum and C. muris. Cattle are most commonly affected, and their feces may be a source of infection for other mammals, including humans. Recent genetic analyses of Cryptosporidium in humans have identified C. hominis as a human-specific pathogen. Infection occurs most commonly in immunocompromised individuals, such as dogs with canine distemper, cats with feline leukemia, and humans with AIDS. *Genus Hammondia is transmitted by ingestion of cysts found in the tissue of grazing animals and rodents. Dogs and cats are the definitive hosts, with H. heydorni infecting dogs and the H. hammondi and H. pardalis infecting cats. Symptoms do not usually occur. *Genus Besnoitia infects cats that ingest cysts in the tissue of rodents and opossums, but usually do not cause disease. *Genus Sarcocystis infects carnivores that ingest cysts from various intermediate hosts. Sarcocystis may cause disease in dogs and cats. *Genus Toxoplasma has one important species, T. gondii. Cats are the definitive host, but all mammals and some fish, reptiles, and amphibians can be intermediate hosts. Only cat feces will hold infective oocysts, but infection through ingestion of cysts can occur with the tissue of any intermediate host. Toxoplasmosis occurs in humans usually as low-grade fever or muscle pain for a few days. A normal immune system will suppress the infection but the tissue cysts will persist in that animal or human for years or for life. In immunocompromised individuals, dormant cysts can be reactivated and cause lesions in the brain, heart, lungs, eyes, and other tissues. A fetus may be at risk if a pregnant woman without immunity becomes infected. Symptoms in cats include fever, weight loss, diarrhea, vomiting, uveitis, and central nervous system signs. Disease in dogs includes paralysis, tremors, and seizures. Dogs and cats are usually treated with clindamycin. *Genus Neospora has one important species, N. caninum, which affects dogs in a manner similar to toxoplasmosis. Neosporosis is difficult to treat. *Genus Hepatozoon contains one species that causes hepatozoonosis in dogs and cats, H. canis. Animals become infected by ingesting an infected brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus). Symptoms include fever, weight loss, and pain in the spine and limbs. The most common medications used to treat coccidian infections are in the sulfonamide antibiotic family. Depending on the pathogen and the condition of the animal, untreated coccidiosis may clear of its own accord, or become severe and damaging, and sometimes cause death. This can also lead to the disruption of sucking of the Mom and sexual reproduction will cease or decrease.

General information Harbour Town Golf Links was designed by Pete Dye in 1967 with the help of professional golfer Jack Nicklaus. Dye also designed another course in the Sea Pines Resort, Heron Point, which he redesigned in 2007. The course is open all year, even during overseeding in October and the aerating of the greens in June, July, and August. Green fees for public play range from $195 to $369, depending on the season. An estimated 38,000 rounds of golf are played at Harbour Town every year. =Grass types= The holes at Harbour Town Golf Links consist of seven different types of grass. Five of the grass types, four of which are Bermudas, are able to withstand the heat during the warm summer months of Hilton Head Island. The other two grass types are annually overseeded in October in order to keep the course green during the cold months. The rye grass that is planted in October is only temporary and will eventually die out when the weather warms up, and the Bermuda grass is no longer dormant. The fairways and rough consist of 419 Bermuda grass. The tee boxes are made up of Celebration Bermuda as well as TifSports Bermuda. The fairways, rough, and tee boxes are overseeded with rye grass in October. Several tee boxes are composed of Empire Zoysia which does not become dormant (brown) in the winter. These Zoysia tee boxes do not need do be overseeded. Harbour Town Golf Link's greens consist of TifEagle Bermuda which is overseeded with Poa Trivialis in October. The course superintendent, Jonathan Wright, is in charge of maintaining the different types of grass. =Magazine rankings= Golf Digest ranked Harbour Town the 2011-2012 #21 ranked public course in America after previously being ranked #13 in 2010. PGA Tour professionals rated Harbour Town the #2 ranked golf course played on tour in a survey performed by Golf Digest. Golf Magazine rates Harbour Town the 2012 #12 rated public course in America. In 2010, it was ranked #14 in the country by Golf Magazine. Course information Harbour Town Golf Links is a par 71 course and from the back tees, relatively short for a PGA Tour event; most are on courses that average . For its inaugural tour event in 1969, the course was set at . It has slick and firm Bermuda grass greens that are small in size; they average in area, while the average on tour is . Several holes have a very small margin of error between greens and water hazards (4, 8, 14, 17, 18). Tee shots and lay-ups must be placed in the strategic part of fairway in order to have a direct shot into the green. Sometimes golfers get blocked out by overhanging trees, even if they are in the fairway. Holes in which players may be blocked out from the fairway include numbers 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 16. Compared to other courses Harbour Town has high percentage of holes with this challenge. The ninth hole is a tight par 4 that can be reached from the tee with a long drive. It normally plays around , tempting golfers to go for a small green guarded by bunkers. The two finishing holes are along Calibogue Sound, so the water line can vary due to changing tides. The hazard line is permanent, but shots can be played off the sand at low tide. On the final two holes, wind off the water must be factored. The seventeenth hole, a par three, plays southwest and usually into a headwind. The eighteenth is the signature hole and heads northward; its entire left side is guarded by the sound and the right is lined with out of bounds stakes. The red-and-white-striped Harbour Town lighthouse is a backdrop, often a good target for approach shots to the green. : The Heritage Classic From 1969 to 2019, Harbour Town Golf Links hosted the RBC Heritage on the PGA Tour, held in April the weekend following the Masters Tournament. Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) now sponsors the golf tournament after Verizon discontinued their sponsorship of the event following the 2010 event. It is the only PGA Tour event that is annually held in South Carolina. The PGA Championship was played at the Ocean Course at Kiawah Island in 2012, won by Rory McIlroy. The inaugural tournament, \\"The Heritage Golf Classic,\\" was held in late November 1969, with a winner's share of Forty-year-old Arnold Palmer claimed the first victory in 1969 with 283 (‚Äì1) on November 30, his first win in over The Heritage Classic, undergoing several different official names, has been held at Harbour Town annually since 1969. The founder of Sea Pines, Charles E. Fraser, started the tradition of the Heritage Classic, and the tournament is always started with a ceremonial tee shot into Calibogue Sound by the defending champion; a cannon is fired simultaneously as the ball is struck. PGA Tour professionals rated the course #2 in a Golf Digest survey named \\"Top 10 PGA Tour Courses\\" in 2012, behind only Augusta National, ranked the world's greatest golf course by Golf Digest. Harbour Town offers a different sort of challenge than most of the courses played on tour; the course plays differently due to the short yardage and tight fairways. Most courses played on tour are much longer in yardage but have a wider margin of error off the tee and through the green. Strategically placed oaks, pines, and palmettos line and overhang the slim fairways. Professionals will sometimes find themselves having no direct shot to the green even from their own fairway. Tee shots have to be placed on the ideal side of the fairway in order to win the tournament. Another challenging aspect of the course is from the small and slick Bermuda greens. Breaks are subtle and tricky to read as a result of the grain present in the Bermuda grass. Lagoons and inner coastal waterways edge up to the greens forcing players to take more conservative shots. Winning scores vary considerably from year to year because of the different challenges. Tour players may take advantage of the short yardages and having wedge shots into the greens, but at the same time run the risk of finding themselves in the thick trees with no shot or in a water hazard. The record low score at The Heritage is by Webb Simpson in 2020, with a victory margin of one shot. Champions now win a prize of over $1.2 million, as well as the traditional tartan plaid jacket.

In cooperation with a foreign exchange student from Thailand, Mancuso built one of the largest domestic drug cartels in U.S. history. The son of immigrants from Italy, Mancuso was a real estate developer before venturing into the lucrative narcotics business. His smuggling operation began in the late 1960s, when he teamed up with a group of college friends from Tahoe Paradise College. At first, they only sold marijuana at their college, but soon the business grew. When authorities moved in on their growing operation at a small farm in Clay County, Kansas, they began importing marijuana from Mexico. Later Mancuso teamed up with a Thai exchange student to import more potent marijuana into San Francisco.Rob Haeseler, Tahoe College Buddies Build Marijuana Empire, San Francisco Chronicle, Jan. 17, 1995, p.

A1 Anthony White, assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Nevada, brought charges against Mancuso in 1990 and it was hailed as one of the largest drug conspiracy cases in state history. The indictment alleged that Mancuso used a multi-state cocaine and marijuana smuggling operation to buy ranches, mountaintop retreats, beach- front estates and anything else he might want.Bill Moushey, Wrath of Vengeance, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Mancuso was sentenced to nine years in prison on June 27, 1995. His sentence was greatly reduced because of his cooperation with the government in cases against other alleged organization members and Mancuso's lawyer Patrick Hallinan. As a result of his assistance to the government, Mancuso was allowed to keep $5 million in proceeds from his trafficking business. Hallinan was subsequently acquitted of obstruction of justice and drug conspiracy charges. Mancuso's property in Hawaii was seized by the federal government and sold; the $800,000 proceeds were forwarded to the California and Nevada law enforcement agencies that pursued him. His daughter, Julia Mancuso, was a decorated member of the U.S. Ski Team until retiring following an injury. She won the gold medal in the giant slalom at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy, the silver medal in the downhill at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada, and the bronze metal in the women's combine event at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

The female equivalent of an Ah Beng is an Ah Lian ().Beng Huat Chua (2003) Life is not complete without shopping for bimbo products: consumption culture in Singapore, Singapore University Press A stereotypical Ah Beng would be someone who is not highly educated, is loud and unsophisticated, and operates within secret societies and street gangs. Ah Lians on the other hand are regarded as bimbos, and are stereotyped as anti-intellectual, superficial, materialistic, and shallow. Outside of Southeast Asia, in English-speaking countries, the equivalent of an Ah Beng would be Australia's Bogans, US's Rednecks and Britain's Chavs. Etymology Ah Beng comes from the romanization of the Hokkien pronunciation of ÈòøÊòé (). The character \\"\\" () is commonly used in the names of Chinese males in the region, thus the term \\"Ah Beng\\" alludes to their commonness. In the Cantonese-speaking parts of Malaysia and Singapore, Ah Beng is also known as lala zai (Âï¶Âï¶‰ªî). 'Lala' has no actual meaning in itself, while 'zai' means 'boy'. 'Lala zai' refers to individuals who speak Manglish and possess a strong preference for gaudy fashions or hairstyles.

The state of Volga Bulgaria grew up during the Middle Ages and for a time was subject to the Khazars. The Volga Bulgars became Muslim and incorporated various Turkic peoples to form the modern Volga Tatar ethnic group. The region came under the domination of the Khanate of Kazan in the 15th century. The khanate was conquered by Ivan the Terrible in 1552 and abolished in 1708. This period was marked by settlement of the area by Russians and attempts at conversion to Orthodox Christianity, provoking a number of rebellions among the Tatars and neighbouring groups. In the late 18th and 19th centuries industry developed, economic conditions improved and Tatars achieved more equal status with Russians. However, Tatar national consciousness was growing, and upon the October Revolution of 1917, national institutions were established and independence declared as the Idel-Ural State. After several years of civil war the Soviet government suppressed independence and established the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the Soviet Union. Under Soviet rule there was a famine followed by progressive decline of the Tatar language, culture and religion both Christian and Muslim. The discovery of large petroleum deposits helped to promote further major growth in industry. Around the time of the fall of the USSR in 1991 there were again moves for independence, but in 1994 the region, under the name of Tatarstan, became a constituent republic of the Russian Federation. In 2008 a national assembly, the Milli Mejlis, declared Tatarstan independent, but this status has not been recognised by the United Nations or the Russian government. Tatarstan President's headquarter and Tower of Suyumbike - panoramio Pre-history Human habitation in Tatarstan dates back to the Palaeolithic period. Remains of several cultures of the Stone and Bronze Ages have been discovered within Tatarstan. During the Iron Age (8th century BCE - 3rd century CE), the Ananyino culture, probably a Finno-Ugrian people, dominated the area of the upper Volga and Kama river valleys. From the middle of the 1st millennium BC western Tatarstan was occupied by the Gorodets culture. From the 4th century BCE much of the Volga‚ÄìKama basin was occupied by tribes of the ƒ∞m√§nkisk√§ culture, who are thought to have been related to the Scythians, speakers of one of the Indo-European languages. Around the beginning of the 1st century CE a new group, the so-called Pyanobor culture (probably of Finnic origin) appeared at the lower Kama. During the great migrations of late antiquity Siberian Turkic and Ugric tribes settled the region east of the middle Volga and forced out the Pyanobor culture from the Kama basin. The Pyanobor tribes lingered on in what are now the north and north-western parts of Tatarstan. Turkic peoples The period from roughly 500 to 700 CE saw an influx of Turkic-speaking nomads. These immigrants' culture was related to those of the G√∂kt√ºrks, Khazars and the tribes of Great Bulgaria. Volga Bulgaria The 9th and 10th centuries saw the rise of the first organized state in the region, the Khanate of the Volga Bulgars. The population of Volga Bulgaria was largely agricultural. The cities of Bolghar, Bil√§r, and Suar, among others, appeared with the growth of industry (casting, forging) and trade. Crop-growing and a cattle-breeding played a major role in the economy. The farmers were predominantly free landowners. In the early 10th century the Volga Bulgars converted to Islam, causing their culture to be greatly influenced by that of the Muslim Middle East. =Mongol invasion= After the conquest of Volga Bulgaria by Mongol troops under Batu Khan the country was under the control of the khans of the Golden Horde. As a result of the admixing of different Turkic peoples and languages to the Volga Bolgars during this period, the modern Volga Tatar ethnos emerged. Khanate of Kazan In the first half of the 15th century, as the result of Golden Horde's collapse, the Khanate of Kazan emerged as the dominant power in the Volga‚ÄìKama region. As Muscovy grew in power and struggled for control of trade routes and territory with the Golden Horde's successor states, Kazan was at times dominated by factions favorable to Moscow, and at other times by factions advocating alliance with other Tatar polities such as the Crimean Khanate. Finally, the khanate was conquered by Ivan the Terrible in 1552. After the Russian invasion After 1552 the khanate was governed by Kazan Palace's Office formed in Moscow. In 1555 a bishop was appointed in Kazan with a mandate to baptize the Idel-Ural peoples. Many churches and monasteries were built, and Russian peasants and craftsmen were resettled within Tatarstan. At the same time ethnic Tatars were removed from Kazan proper as well as regions close to rivers and roads. Under pressure from the Russians many Tatars emigrated to the Upper Kama, Trans-Kama area, Bashkortostan, the Urals and Siberia during the 16th and 17th centuries. The result was a decline in agriculture, industry and commerce throughout the region. The local population was forced to pay the yasaq tax. Some part of the Tatar nobility were included in the nobility of the Russian Empire; many underwent baptism to keep their privileges. In 1708, the Khanate of Kazan was abolished and the province was placed under the control of a new Kazan Governorate. It included Middle Volga and Western Urals. Kazan, with 20,000 citizens, was one of major trade and handicraft centers of Russia. Manufacturing developed and in the beginning of 19th century major hide, soap and candle factories appeared. A class of Tatar merchants arose, who carried on brisk trade with Central Asia. Restrictions in occupation, heavy taxation, and discrimination against non-Christians blocked the cultural and economic development of the Tatars. Several rebellions and peasants' wars broke out as a result. During the Time of Troubles, the Kazan khanate regained its independence with the aid of factions within the Russian army. Cangali bek, a Tatar nobleman, led another revolution in 1616. Other insurrections among the Volga Tatars included the Bolotnikov movement (1606‚Äì1607), Batƒ±r≈üa movement (1755‚Äì1756), and Pugachev's war (1773‚Äì1775). Other peoples of the Idel-Ural region took part in these conflicts. In 1773, Muslims in Russia were granted greatly expanded rights. In 1784 Tatar noblemen (morzalar) had equal rights with Russian noblemen (dvoryane). Tatar soldiers took part in all Russian wars, sometimes in national units (as was the case during the Napoleonic Wars). After the reforms of the 1860s in Imperial Russia economic conditions in Tatarstan improved markedly. Stolypin's reforms led to accelerated economic development of the rural areas. In the 19th century a large middle class developed among the Tatars. The Russian Revolution of 1905 awakened Tatar national consciousness and led to calls for equal rights, development of a distinct national culture and national self-consciousness as well as other freedoms. The pan-Islamic Russian party Ittifaq al-Muslimin represented the growing nationalist camp within the State Duma. The first Tatar mass-media appeared during this period with the publication of Tatar language newspapers such as \\"Yoldƒ±z\\", \\"Waqƒ±t\\", \\"Azat\\", \\"Azat xalƒ±q\\", \\"ƒ∞rek\\", \\"Ta√± yoldƒ±zƒ±\\", \\"Nur\\", \\"Fiker\\", \\"Ural\\", \\"Qazan m√∂xbire\\", \\"√Ñlƒü√§srelc√§did\\", \\"≈ûura\\", \\"A√±\\", and \\"M√§kt√§p\\". The first Tatar professional theatre, the S√§yy√§r also emerged at this time. * Bezdna Unrest Revolution and Civil War The front line in August, 1918. During the chaos of the Russian Revolutions of 1917, Tatarstan became functionally independent with a national parliament (Mill√§t M√§clese), national government (Milli ƒ∞dar√§), national council (Milli ≈ûura), and a national military council (X√§rbi ≈ûura). Some Tatar military units took part in the Russian Civil War against the communists. Anti-communist Tatar revolutionaries declared the Idel-Ural State, but the Moscow Bolshevist government moved to prevent an independent Tatarstan on its flank. The \\"Muslim Council\\" was overthrown by a \\"Workers' Bolshevik Council\\" in a mostly Tatar- populated part of Kazan province called Bolaq artƒ± or Zabulachye (In English, the \\"Transbolaqia Republic\\"). The Muslim Council was arrested. In August 1918, the White Czechs and KomUch forces reached Kazan, but retreated under the Red pressure. In 1919 the Bolsheviks declared an autonomous Tatar-Bashkir Soviet Socialist Republic, but the region was at the time largely occupied by the White Army, the leader of whom, General Kolchak, did not support an independent Muslim republic. The declaration, coupled with Kolchak's hostility, caused many Tatar and Bashkir troops to switch sides and fight for the Bolsheviks. Ultimately, the victorious Communists subsumed Tatarstan within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), leading to large-scale emigration from the country, particularly among the upper class. The Russian Civil War ended in Tatarstan with the suppression of the anti- communist peasant Pitchfork Uprising in March 1920. As a result of war communism policy the 1921-1922 Famine in Tatarstan had begun and annihilated nearly half a million people. Soviet rule On 27 May 1920 the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (TASSR) of the RSFSR was declared. However, in the late 1920s the Soviet government under Joseph Stalin began to place restrictions on the use of the Tatar language (among many other minority languages in the Soviet Union). The development of national culture declined significantly. The Tatar alphabet was switched twice (to the Latin alphabet and then to Cyrillic). From the 1930s through the 1950s, Tatar-language press, cultural institutions, theatres, national schools and institutes gradually disappeared, as education was required to be conducted in the Russian language. Industrialization, the rise of the collective farms kolektivizatsiya and persecutions such as the Great Purge contributed to this decline. Religion was also repressed. At first, Soviet rule favored mostly the Eastern Orthodox Church, and some Islamic religious streams were preserved (see Jadidism, W√§isi movement), but later they also were repressed. Some theologians of Jadidism (which was liberal to Soviet rule at first) escaped to Turkey or Egypt. More than 560,000 Tatarstan soldiers took part in World War II and more than 300,000 of them were killed. Many Soviet plants and their workers, as well as the Soviet Academy of Sciences, were evacuated to Tatarstan. During the war large petroleum deposits were discovered. During their exploration, Tatarstan became one of the most industrially developed regions of the Soviet Union. In 1960s-1970s Tatar ASSR's industry was developed not only in the petrol sector; a major car plant, KamAZ was built in Naberezhnye Chelny, making this city become the second largest in the republic. Other major cities, built and developed in those years are Nizhnekamsk and Almetyevsk. Post-Soviet history Tatarstan map The Supreme Council of TASSR changed Tatarstan's status on 30 August 1990 and a declaration of sovereignty of the Tatarstan Soviet Socialistic Republic was made. *12 June 1991: The first elections for President of Tatarstan. Mintimer Shaymiev was elected. *21 March 1992: Referendum held regarding Tatarstan's status. The majority of the population supported Tatarstan's independence. *November 1992: The Constitution of Tatarstan was accepted by parliament. *1994: The Treaty On Delimitation of Jurisdictional Subjects and Mutual Delegation of Authority between the State Bodies of the Russian Federation and the State Bodies of the Republic of Tatarstan was signed.

They played five One-day Internationals (ODIs), two Test matches and one Twenty20 International. They also played one One Day International against Ireland, which they won easily. They won two of the three ODIs, and were also looking to win the third, but a good last over from Katherine Brunt, yielding only four runs, gave England victory. Brunt was also the heroine of the second Test, where she took nine wickets in the match and made 52 in England's first Test win over the Australians since December 1984. It also gave England their first win in the Women's Ashes since 1963. England also won their next ODI thanks to a century from Claire Taylor, but Australia took the series 3-2 after winning the last ODI by just four runs. The last match of the series was a Twenty20 International, which was Australia's first, and they won it by seven wickets.  ODIs in Ireland  Three ODIs in Ireland were planned (29, 31 July and 1 August), but only one was actually played - the other two were rained off. However, in the match that was played on 31 July, Australia beat the Irish women's cricket team by 240 runs, Karen Rolton and Lisa Sthalekar both making centuries as Australia made 295 for 3, and Cecelia Joyce top- scored for Ireland with a paltry 18 - Shelley Nitschke taking four for 15 as Ireland collapsed to 55 all out in 26 overs.  Matches in England  =Test Series= 1st Test England got an excellent start to the first women's Test at Hove, where two debutants were to take centre stage; but the match petered out into a draw. In one of the highlights of the first day of play, Belinda Clark ‚Äì arguably Australia's best batter ‚Äì had been bowled by Jenny Gunn for a two-ball duck. It was to be Gunn's only wicket of the day, but probably the most vital. All-rounder Rosalie Birch and 15-year-old debutante spinner Holly Colvin then took two wickets each as Australia crumbled to 115 for 7, Karen Rolton being the only batter on top of the bowlers. However, as the day wore on, England lost their stamina, and the lower order batters took over. No. 7 Cathryn Fitzpatrick, No. 9 Julie Hayes and Test debutante No. 10 Shelley Nitschke all made fifties as Australia eked out 223 more runs before the end of the first day, losing only two more wickets, and Nitschke was 70 not out overnight. She finished on an unbeaten 81, as Australia added a further 27 before Clea Smith was lbw to Katherine Brunt, to end with 355. England scored slowly after losing Laura Newton for 24, as they used 129 overs to make 273 ‚Äì Charlotte Edwards top-scoring with 69, while Arran Brindle made her second Test half-century with 54. Nitschke and Lisa Sthalekar took three wickets each, but England fought back. Gunn took two more wickets, removing both openers for ducks, as Belinda Clark recorded a pair, but Karen Rolton and Sthalekar took the score beyond England's grasp. Rolton was finally run out for 97, but she had led the Australians to a 254-run lead at the end of day three. Australia added a further 51 to that on the fourth morning - slow left arm bowler Clare Connor taking four for 68 in a marathon bowling effort. England quickly determined 306 in 95 overs was too tough after they crumbled to 14 for 3, but Brindle stood firm at the crease, taking four hours for a maiden Test century, and England made it to the end of the scheduled time having only lost seven wickets. Thus, the second Test would now decide the series. 2nd Test Despite rain washing out parts of the first day at New Road, England took their first Test victory over Australia since December 1984, and their first Ashes series win since 1963. Having won the toss, England captain Clare Connor opted to bowl, and after Belinda Clark had slashed 18 runs she was trapped lbw by pacer Katherine Brunt. Wickets were shared out among the entire England team, no Australian passed 40, and by the end of the day they had crashed to 126 for 7. It took 33 deliveries for Australia to be all out on the second morning - for 131, as the efforts from the last Test, when the last three wickets outscored the rest of the batting line-up, were not repeated. Brunt took care of that, having Nitschke and Price caught behind to complete her five-wicket-haul. Batting was clearly difficult, but Jenny Gunn, Clare Connor and Claire Taylor all dug in to make scores above 30, before a vital partnership between Taylor and Beth Morgan took England to a relatively comfortable lead, as they moved to 196 for 6 before Emma Liddell struck twice and Cathryn Fitzpatrick once to leave England at 222 for 9 at close of play of day two. Liddell and Fitzpatrick bowled 59 overs between them on the second day, out of a total of 101, and although they shared seven wickets, they failed to remove either of Brunt or Isa Guha, and the last English pair added 18 before the end of day two. On the third day, England powered on, Brunt staking her claim for Player of the Match with a vital, powerful 52 - her first Test fifty - as she eked out 83 runs with Guha for the tenth wicket, Guha making 31 not out. Leading by 158 on first innings, England got a dream start by dismissing Lisa Keightley for a duck, and wickets just kept falling. Gunn and Brunt took two wickets each as the Australians faltered to 18 for 4, before the twin sisters Kate and Alex Blackwell fought back. However, Isa Guha removed Alex, another two wickets fell, and by tea Australia were 67 for 7. An attritional partnership for the seventh wicket between Kate Blackwell and Shelley Nitschke, which yielded 112 runs in four hours, carried Australia past 100, but still they were only 21 ahead with three wickets in hand at the close of day three. The last day started just like England wanted, Katherine Brunt dismissing Kate Blackwell and wicket-keeper Julia Price with successive deliveries, and all that was left was to take the last wicket. England toiled, but the Australians defended for nearly two hours and faced 35 overs, until number 11 Emma Liddell finally edged behind to Jane Smit and was out for 24. Shelley Nitschke made her second fifty in two Tests and was left stranded on 88 not out, while slow left arm bowler Clare Connor ended with the bowling analysis of 26-20-25-1. Brunt finished with four wickets in the second innings, for a match total of nine for 111. England were thus left to chase 75 for the Ashes, but Emma Liddell did not want to be beaten, and her pace trapped Laura Newton and Jenny Gunn lbw in the second over as England lost their first two wickets for one run. However, Liddell could not make any further breakthroughs, and even though England lost Connor and Edwards to Fitzpatrick - both lbw - Arran Brindle batted out an hour for 24 not out to see England to the target about three hours before the scheduled close. =WODI Series= 1st WODI England set themselves up well against Australia, but failed to hit out in the last over thanks to some accurate and fierce bowling from Cathryn Fitzpatrick, who had earlier hit 38 not out with the bat to lift Australia to 222 for 7 after three for 39 from Clare Connor. Arran Brindle continued on her magnificent form from the first Test, when she made a fifty and a hundred, and in partnerships with Jenny Gunn and Claire Taylor she lifted the English to 198 for 4 with her score of 81. With only 25 runs left to hit for the last six wickets, it was there for the taking. But Fitzpatrick returned, having taken the wicket of Laura Newton earlier on, and she took three more wickets as the English lower order were strangled - and collapsed to 210 all out with five balls remaining in the innings. Fitzpatrick ended with figures of four for 19 from 10 overs, and Emma Liddell also took three for 29. 2nd WODI Slow left arm bowler Shelley Nitschke bowled Australia to a win and a 2-0 series lead in the second match of the ODI series, after good bowling from the English women had limited Australia to 193 for 8 in 50 overs. Kate Blackwell and Lisa Keightley both made fifties for Australia, while Belinda Clark continued her poor run of form - two ducks in the Tests and 16 in the first ODI was followed up with a 45-ball 10 today. England wicket-keeper Claire Taylor made three stumpings, two off medium pace bowler Isa Guha. England's reply started well, with Laura Newton and Claire Taylor making their way to 80 for 1 after Charlotte Edwards had been dismissed initially, but the English bowler just couldn't play the spin of Nitschke, who recorded a career-best analysis of 7 for 24, despite six wides. Only Newton and Taylor passed 10, while Arran Brindle's good form (with 236 runs in three innings so far in the series) came to a halt as she was bowled by Nitschke for a golden duck. England's final score was 128 all out, with more than 10 overs potentially remaining in the innings. 3rd WODI England needed a victory to keep the five-match One-day International series alive, and with Australia needing six runs off the last over, it looked like the Australians would secure the series with two matches to spare. However, Katherine Brunt had the last say, as she first had Cathryn Fitzpatrick stumped and then helped to run out Julie Hayes for a duck. Suddenly, Australia needed four from the last ball to win, and they could only get one, as England went into scenes of jubilation - having secured their first victory over the Australian women since 1993. Earlier, Claire Taylor had lifted England to 200 for 7 with her 82, taking on Fitzpatrick who conceded 61 runs in her 10 overs. All the six Australian bowlers got one wicket, however, with the seventh being a run out. Australia's opener Belinda Clark recorded another poor score with a six-ball duck, and Australia continued to lose wickets at regular intervals. Yet, at 195 for 5 with an over to spare, the wise money would normally have been on the tourists, but thanks to Brunt, it went England's way instead. 4th WODI England won by four wickets England, buoyed by having won their first Ashes Test series in 42 years, tied the series at 2-2 with a victory at The County Ground, Taunton. Australia, however, made a good start with Lisa Keightley and Karen Rolton making fifties to propel the team to 142 for 1. Two quick wickets from Clare Connor slowed them down, however, and they finished with a total on 215 for 5. Chasing that total, England lost Charlotte Edwards for 1 in the second over, but Laura Newton and Claire Taylor put them back with a 65-run partnership. Spinner Lisa Sthalekar then took two quick wickets, and England were set back to 79 for 3 after 19.3 overs. Despite two maiden overs from left-arm bowler Karen Rolton, Taylor kept hitting boundaries, ending with 116 before finally letting a ball from Cathryn Fitzpatrick onto her stumps - bowled for 116. By that time, though, she had made the first century of the series, and England only needed five more runs to win. Lydia Greenway and Jane Smit carried England over the target with nine balls to spare, setting up the fifth and final match, also at Taunton, to be a series decider. (Cricinfo scorecard) 5th WODI Australia won by four runs England's run of victories - with three, their longest successive streak of wins over Australia - came to an end at The County Ground, Taunton as Australia recorded their first win in four matches against the English. It was another close bout, with the match result uncertain till the very last over. Australia batted first, and made 260 for 6, with Lisa Keightley, Karen Rolton and Lisa Sthalekar all making fifties, and Belinda Clark recording her highest score of the tour with 36. Leg-spinner Charlotte Edwards took three for 47 to set Australia back somewhat in the late overs, however. When England batted, Edwards shared an opening partnership of 94 with Laura Newton, and both made half-centuries as England paced themselves well, keeping the required run rate just around six per over. However, fast bowler Cathryn Fitzpatrick took four wickets to trouble the English middle order, having Arran Brindle bowled for 50 to see England to 240 for 6. England only needed 20 for the last four wickets, and with England's captain Clare Connor hitting a couple of fours after being forced down the order, England needed six off the last over to win with one wicket in hand - having suffered two run outs as well. Isa Guha hit the first ball for a single, bringing Connor on strike with five needed. However, Kirsten Pike held a catch off Connor's top-edge, and England were all out for 256, five short of their first ODI series victory over Australia since 1976. (Cricinfo scorecard) =Women's Twenty20 International: England v Australia (2 September)= Australia won by seven wickets Cathryn Fitzpatrick, playing her last international match in England, combined with Karen Rolton to be the main reasons for Australia a comfortable victory in the second women's Twenty20 international of all time. England batted first, and Charlotte Edwards and Laura Newton added 77 for the first wicket, but when Newton and Edwards departed England began to struggle. Fitzpatrick's economical bowling yielded only 14 runs from four overs, including a maiden over to Rosalie Birch (who made one run off seven balls in the last three balls). Some boundaries in the late overs from Clare Connor and Katherine Brunt, however, saw England to a total of 151 for 7. Brunt then took three early wickets for England as Australia faltered to six runs for three wickets, and England's hopes were increasing. No one could support Brunt with the ball, however, and Karen Rolton slashed 16 fours and one six in an unbeaten 96 to guide Australia home with fourteen deliveries remaining. Kate Blackwell supported her well, making 43, and no one except Brunt could keep the run rate below 8 an over.

Depending on the manner of formation, soil crusts can be biological or physical. Biological soil crusts are formed by communities of microorganisms that live on the soil surface whereas physical crusts are formed by physical impact such as that of raindrops. Biological soil crusts Biological soil crusts are communities of living organisms on the soil surface in arid- and semi-arid ecosystems. They are found throughout the world with varying species composition and cover depending on topography, soil characteristics, climate, plant community, microhabitats, and disturbance regimes. Biological soil crusts perform important ecological roles including carbon fixation, nitrogen fixation, soil stabilization, alter soil albedo and water relations, and affect germination and nutrient levels in vascular plants. They can be damaged by fire, recreational activity, grazing, and other disturbance and can require long time periods to recover composition and function. Biological soil crusts are also known as cryptogamic, microbiotic, microphytic, or cryptobiotic soils. Physical soil crusts Physical (as opposed to biological) soil crusts results from raindrop or trampling impacts. They are often hardened relative to uncrusted soil due to the accumulation of salts and silica. These can coexist with biological soil crusts, but have different ecological impact due to their difference in formation and composition. Physical soil crusts often reduce water infiltration, can inhibit plant establishment, and when disrupted can be eroded rapidly.Belnap, Jayne, et al. 2001.

He was a prolific translator in Germany, working under his original name Felix Paul Greve and posing as a dandy, before he left Berlin to start a new life in North America in late July 1909. Settling in Manitoba, Canada, in 1912, he became a well known Canadian fiction writer exploring Western prairie pioneer life in vibrant multi-cultural communities. A bigamist,Gammel, Irene. Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada and Everyday Modernity. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002, 155 Grove constructed his entire life as an intricate web of fact and fiction. He died in 1948 on his estate in Simcoe, Ontario, where he had resided since 1930. Life =Early life in Europe= Grove was born Felix Paul Greve in Radomno, West Prussia, but was brought up in Hamburg where he graduated with the Abitur from the Gymnasium Johanneum in 1898. After studying classical languages and archaeology in Bonn, he became a prolific translator of world literature and a member of Stefan George's homoerotic group, the George-Kreis, around 1900. During his year in Munich, he befriended Karl Wolfskehl, and briefly shared an address with Thomas Mann at the Pension Gisels from August to September 1902. In early 1903, amidst scandal, he settled in Palermo, Italy, with Else Pl√∂tz Endell, the wife of renowned architect August Endell (she would later become Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven). In his 1946 autobiography In Search of Myself, Grove suggests that despite the homoerotic context of his work up to late 1902, his first sexual encounter with Elsa determined his sexuality: \\"If I had not always been so, I had become definitely, finally heterosexual.\\"qtd. in Gammel, Baroness Elsa, 127. Grove's rising career took a dramatic downward spin that followed his alliance with Else. Unable to repay loans made by his intimate friend and wealthy patron Herman Kilian, he was promptly charged and convicted of fraud; from 1903‚Äì04, he served a deeply humiliating one-year sentence in the penitentiary in Bonn, leaving his reputation destroyed. Much suggests that Kilian (whose Anglo- German ancestry Grove would later appropriate for himself in his Canadian autobiographies) had acted from motives of jealousy. While in prison, Grove composed his first novel, Fanny Essler, a thinly veiled roman √† clef about Else's sexual adventures, including her marriage with August Endell.Gammel, Baroness Elsa, 132. The novel, which moreover poked fun at the Stefan George circle, prompted a complete break from George's coterie. From 1904 to early 1906, the pair lived in voluntary exile, first in Wollerau, Switzerland, then in Paris-Plage, France, from where Grove paid H. G. Wells a few visits in his Sandhurst villa just across the Channel. In 1906, the couple returned to Berlin, where they were married on August 22, 1907.Gammel, Baroness Elsa, 144. =Life in North America= By 1909, Grove was again in deep financial trouble, having double-sold his latest German translation, Jonathan Swift's Prosa Werke in four volumes.See Temple Scott's edition, which is extant in Grove's Library Collection at the UMA. See also the opening pages of Grove's 1927 Search for America, which provides details that led to the discovery of FPG's transatlantic passage in October 1998, shortly after the \\"In Memoriam FPG: 1879-1948-1998\\" Symposium commemorating the 50th Anniversary of his death With his wife's help, he staged his suicideGammel, Baroness Elsa, 145. and departed for North America on the White Star Line's SS Megantic in late July 1909. His wife joined him a year later in Pittsburgh, and the couple farmed near Sparta, Kentucky, until 1911, when Grove left her permanently. She modeled for artists in nearby Cincinnati, and later became well known in New York dada circles as the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven after her marriage in 1913 to the German Baron Leopold von Freytag-Loringhoven. Grove moved west and stayed on a large Bonanza farm near Fargo (based on the Amenia & Sharon Land Company) in the late summer of 1912. In 1912 Grove, whose legal name was still Greve, arrived in Manitoba, Canada, where he changed his name to Frederick Philip Grove and married a young schoolteacher, Catherine Wiens, on August 2, 1914.Gammel, Baroness Elsa, 154. There are no records of a divorce from his first wife, who details in her memoir that he had suddenly deserted her.Gammel, Baroness Elsa, 153. He first taught in rural areas, such as Haskett, Winkler, Virden, and Gladstone, but after settling in Rapid City in 1922, he devoted himself entirely to his writing career. In 1927, Grove and his wife suffered the devastating loss of their only child, Phyllis May, shortly before her twelfth birthday. In 1928‚Äì29, Grove went on three coast-to- coast lecture tours, before the couple moved to Ontario in the fall of 1929. There, their son, Arthur Leonard Grove, was born on October 14, 1930.Leonard Grove was a lawyer who lived in Toronto. He died in October 2006, just a few days shy of his 76th birthday. Grove briefly became an editor with Graphic Publishers, who had published his first autobiographical novel, A Search for America, in 1927, before moving to Simcoe, Ontario. From there, he continued to write despite increasing ill-health, until he suffered a crippling stroke in late 1946. While in Simcoe, he ran for the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in the 1943 Ontario general election. Work and legacy Frederick Philip Grove is best known for exploring the Canadian West and its pioneer landscape in non-fiction and semi-fictionalized works such as Over Prairie Trails, Settlers of the Marsh, A Search for America, and In Search of Myself. \\"Grove gave a voice to the land-hungry pioneers of the West, but also cloaked his past in the ostensible honesty of the prairie pioneer novel.\\"Gammel, Irene. \\"Staging Personalities in Modernism and Realism.\\" Cambridge History of Canadian Literature. Ed. Coral Ann Howells and Eva-Marie Kr√∂ller. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009, 251. Known for his rugged realism and naturalism, Grove created memorable pioneer characters, such as Niels Lindstedt, the hardworking and sexually naive Swedish immigrant pioneer in Settlers of the Marsh (1925); Abe Spalding, the noble but single- minded pioneer in Fruits of the Earth, and John Elliot, the aging and tragic patriarch in Our Daily Bread. Grove patriarchs are all strong and tragic, often lacking the words to change their fates. In contrast, Grove's female characters are survivors, verbally nimble and often assuming traditionally male roles. Most important, Grove's novels all evoke the polyglot world of immigrants. His novels are populated with a remarkable diversity of Swedish, German, French, Icelandic, and Ukrainian immigrants, offering a vibrant multi- culturalism as a vision for Canada's social fabric. As an author he assumed the role of \\"spokesperson for the young Canadian nation,\\" who cleverly staged himself as \\"an adopted son [in Canada]\\" in lecture tours, essays, and advertisements.Gammel, \\"Staging Personalities,\\" 252. Grove also experimented with forms of modernism, both in staging fictionalized selves in his autobiographical fiction, and in experimenting with unreliable narrators and time shifts in his late novel, The Master of the Mill.Gammel, \\"Staging Personalities,\\" 254. Grove's Archives Grove's papers were acquired by the University of Manitoba (UM) from his widow Catherine Wiens in the early 1960s. This source collection fills 24 archival boxes, and contains many published and unpublished manuscripts, typescripts, and notebooks, as well as six German poems in Grove'e hand‚Äîone of which is obviously related to Greve's published poem \\"Erster Sturm\\" (1907). ‚Äì A voluminous Finding Aid for Mss 2 was prepared in 1972.

'Fanny Essler' in Die Freistatt (found in the DLA, Marbach, in April 1990) * Greve's passage to North America on the White Star Liner Megantic from Liverpool to Montreal in July 1909 (found shortly after the 1998 international FPG Anniversary Symposium) * the Bonanza Farm \\"in the Dakotas\\" described in A Search for America (1925) (found in March 1996 at the NDSU archives, Fargo, & video-recorded as the Linguistic Circle of Manitoba & North Dakota's 1996 LCMND Presidential Dinner Address at the University of Winnipeg) * Else & Greve's Sparta, Kentucky, location in 1910/11 (known ONLY from her poem \\"Schalk\\" in the University of Maryland, College Park, FrL Collection; discovered there in April 1991, & included as facsimile 49b in FPG's Poetry Ed. published in Dec. 1993. ‚Äì [e-Ed.] of this poem in comparison with Greve's \\"Erster Sturm\\") http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~fgrove/ill_pgs/txt_frlSchalkFEsonsFPG1stSturm.html http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~fgrove/ill_pgs/ill_sparta.html * two NYT articles about FPG & FrL (found in 2004 via ProQuest: Pittsburgh arrest for cross- dressing & smoking in public, Sep. 1910, and about FrL's 1915 modelling jobs in NY * two FrL images showing her in exotic garb & pose (found in 2006 at the Library of Congress' Bain Collection): one showing FrL alone, the other showing FrL leaning on Jamaican poet Claude McKay FPG Book Collections: Greve's Translations & Grove's Library The UMA hold all of Grove's and Greve's known publications. Canadian & some foreign theses are also extant in various formats. The Grove Library & the Greve Translations Collections are available online: * The Grove Library Collection of some 500 titles contains many of the incredible number of books Grove translated into German when he was Greve. Most notable are perhaps certain Meredith titles, & a complete set of Temple Scott's Swift edition. * The FPG Translations Collection reflects a complete record of Greve's titanic efforts, 1898‚Äì1909, starting out with Dante sonnets, Oscar Wilde texts & criticism, Browning, Dowson, Pater, Meredith, Swinburne (both of whom died in 1909 when Greve chose voluntary exile), H. G. Wells, Balzac, Flaubert, & Gide, as well as all 12 v. from Burton's Arabian Nights. \\"In Memoriam FPG\\": 1998 Anniversary Symposium The international anniversary symposium \\"In Memoriam FPG: 1879-1948-1998\\" was recorded on 12 videos. In 2007, they were digitized & became the Symposium's e-Proceedings. FPG & FrL Endowment (1995ff) A FPG & FrL Endowment Fund devoted to Greve/Grove and Freytag-Loringhoven projects was established in 1995/96. Promotional brochures, various e-text publications, and the FPG & FrL Website were all partly or entirely funded by this endowment. Pseudonyms Grove used so many aliases that Karl Wolfskehl called him a Pseudologe and referred to his Munchhausiaden. FPG: he used these initials on both sides of the Atlantic. Grove: a modification of the author's real name, Greve. On the Immigration Manifesto of the White Star Liner Megantic on July 31, 1909, Grove's name was smudged, though the central vowel looks like an \\"o\\". Fanny Essler: Joint pseudonym for F.P. Greve and Else Greve used in 1904‚Äì05, for poem published in Die Freistatt. F. C. Gerden: used in correspondence with his Insel publishers for translations of decadent literature (Dowson, Browning). Konrad Thorer: used for translations of works by Miguel de Cervantes and Alain-Ren√© Lesage. Andrew R. Rutherford: a pseudonym suggested (but not used) for his first Canadian book Over Prairie Trails (1922); the name, which references Grove's friend Herman Kilian's maternal grandfather, a renowned Scottish judge, also appears in relation to his unpublished typescript in the University of Manitoba Archives, Jane Atkinson (ca. 1923, e-publ. 2000). Works about Grove Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven wrote a poem entitled \\"Kinship,\\" which is dedicated to Grove: \\"Memory to F.P.G.\\" In this poem, she juxtaposes the beginning and the ending of their ten-year relationship, using eroticized horseback riding as a metaphor for a highly charged journey through memory.Freytag-Loringhoven, Body Sweats: The Uncensored Writings of Elsa Von Freytag-Loringhoven. Ed. Irene Gammel and Suzanne Zelazo. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2011, 240‚Äì41, 380. The Canadian heavy metal band Torture for Pleasure quote directly from Groves' novel Settlers of the Marsh in their song \\"TETELESTAI (Sweet Darkness),\\" released independently in 2013. Biographies and scholarship D. O. Spettigue discovered Grove's identity behind a web of fiction in October 1971 in the British Museum. Uncovering Grove's prison incarceration in Germany, Spettigue published his findings in his 1973 book FPG: The European Years. This monograph was followed by Paul I. Hjartarson's volume of essays, A Stranger to My Life, and prompted the translation of Grove's German fiction into English, Fanny Essler, and The Master Mason‚Äôs House, both closely based on the life of Grove's first wife Elsa Pl√∂tz (aka The Baroness). Desmond Pacey edited The Letters of F.P. Grove in addition to publishing a monograph, Frederick Philip Grove, while Margaret Stobie explored Grove's teaching years in Manitoba in her book, Frederick Philip Grove. Leading later efforts to establish the identity of Greve/Grove by unearthing new biographical information and relevant records, Klaus Martens has been \\"the chief pioneer\\" (W.J. Keith). Exploring both the European and Canadian contexts, Martens published Felix Paul Greves Karriere (in German), Felix Paul Greve ‚Äì Andr√© Gide (correspondence in English, French, and German), and F. P. Grove in Europe and Canada: Translated Lives, the first well documented biography of the author in English. Martens' vast compilation Over Canadian Trails: F.P. Grove in New Letters and Documents includes the most extensive published collection of letters from and to Grove, including the Phelps correspondence, documents, many photographs, and much relevant commentary by the editor. This was preceded by Martens' A Dirge for My Daughter, a careful edition of selected poems by Grove which includes photographs and reproductions of handwritten letters and notes. In addition to his Grove monographs and editions, Martens published numerous articles on both Grove and Else Pl√∂tz. In her book Sexualizing Power in Naturalism: Theodore Dreiser and Frederick Philip Grove, Irene Gammel examined the gender relationships of Grove's fiction, focussing in particular on his sexualized (and modern) female figures and the overexposed relationships of power. Gammel also traced Grove's relationship with Elsa Pl√∂tz (Baroness Elsa) in her biography Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada, and Everyday Modernity, documenting that the couple had been legally married and that Grove's reasons for hiding his identity had much to do with his fear of being discovered by his former wife, the dada artist Baroness Elsa. It has also been argued, by Martens in Over Canadian Trails, perhaps more persuasively, that Greve understandably changed his identity in order to escape internment as a German national at the outbreak of the Great War. In his essay \\"Felix Paul Greve, The Eulenburg Scandal, and Frederick Philip Grove,\\" Richard Cavell proposed a queering approach to Grove's work, while Paul Hjartarson and Tracy Kulba's collection Baroness Elsa von Freytag- Loringhoven and Felix Paul Greve assembles a range of perspectives by a number of scholars, including the editors, as well as Jutta Ernst, Klaus Martens, and Paul Morris. A great deal of research results have been provided by Dr. Gaby Divay at the University of Manitoba Archives, who also published a comprehensive edition of Grove's, Greve's and \\"Fanny Essler\\"s poetry in December 1993, and as an e-Edition in 2007.

Murphy played college baseball for the University of Florida, and was picked by the Cincinnati Reds in the first round of the 1981 Major League Baseball Draft. In addition to the Reds, he played for the Boston Red Sox, Seattle Mariners, Houston Astros, St. Louis Cardinals, New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers and Florida Marlins.  Early years  Murphy was born in Miami, Florida. He attended Christopher Columbus High School in Miami from 1974 to 1978. He pitched for the varsity baseball team in 1977 and 1978. The 1977 team won the District championship with his 4-hit shutout. He garnered many awards including: Pre-season 1st team All American, 1st team All City, and 1st team All Catholic. After setting school records for most wins (17) and strikeouts (207), he was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers. Murphy's American Legion team, Post 133, won its District Championship in 1976 with Murphy's 11 strikeout performance. Murphy also earned many accolades playing on the football field. For the CCHS Explorers' football team, Murphy was named to the 1976 All Catholic team, and 3rd team All County Team. In 1977, he was first-team All-Catholic, and second-team All- Dade County. By the time Murphy put away his kicking tee, he was Columbus High's All-time leading scorer on the gridiron. Just recently, Murphy was the first baseball player inducted into CCHS Baseball Diamond Hall of Fame, along with Louisiana State baseball coach Paul Mainieri, and former Chicago Cubs general manager Jim Hendry. In 2009, Murphy was inducted into CCHS General Hall of Fame.  College career  Instead of pursuing a professional baseball, Murphy accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for the Gators and advanced his computer science knowledge. As a freshman, Murphy led the Gators in ERA (2.53), and was named the Rookie of the Year. During his sophomore year, Murphy's 3-hit shutout over Tennessee secured the Gators' second consecutive SEC Eastern Division title, while also becoming the first Gator baseball team to win 40 regular season games. His career record was 6-3 while pitching in orange and blue. After his days in Gainesville, Murphy was drafted by Cincinnati Reds in the 1st round, as the third overall draft pick. He was only the 2nd Gator ever selected in the 1st round of the Major League draft.  Professional career  Cincinnati Reds Minor League System 1981 - 1985 1981 - Collected 6 wins for the Florida State League Northern Division champions, Tampa Tarpons. 1983 - Led Cedar Rapids Reds in strikeouts on the way to being Central Division champs. 1984 - Led the Eastern League in saves and captured the win in the championship game for the Eastern League title. Murphy was named Vermont Reds' Fireman of the Year. 1985 - Led the Denver Zephyrs in ERA on their way to the Western Division title of the American Association. Cincinnati Reds 1985-1988 A hard fastball thrower with a sharp slider, Murphy had an inauspicious debut by giving up a 400-foot blast to the first Major League hitter he faced, Mike Marshall. However, Murphy returned in his next outing with two shutout innings that suggested better things lie ahead. In 1986, Rob brought all of his potential to the mound in what was an amazing season. His final ERA in 1986 was 0.72. In the history of Major League baseball, no pitcher who had pitched 50 innings or more had an ERA lower than Murphy‚Äôs. His ERA record still stands in the National League, and has only been lowered by the great Dennis Eckersley, Fernando Rodney and Zach Britton in the American League. That same season, his hits per nine inning ratio (4.65/9ip), had bested the previous National League records posted in 1972 and 1916. When Rob retired in 1995, that hits per inning ratio still stood atop the NL record book. In that memorable 1986 season, Murphy only gave up four doubles, and no triples or home runs. That stingy season led to a Slugging Percentage of .179. That figure crushed the almost 20-year-old record of Ted Abernathy. Murphy‚Äôs record stood for 17 years, and has only been surpassed by Eric Gagne and Craig Kimbrel. In 1987, he followed with another superb year as the busiest left- handed reliever in major league history. His 87 relief appearances were the most ever by a lefty, as he pitched 100.2 innings and struck out 99 batters. As of 2013, 87 appearances is still the most by a Reds left-handed reliever. 1988 saw Murphy lead the National League with 76 games pitched while pitching 84 2/3 innings. In four years with the Reds, Murphy had held 72 of the 78 leads he had been tasked with holding, and had stranded 79% of the runners he inherited. After the season, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox. Comparing Murphy with all Cincinnati Reds‚Äô pitchers that had pitched at least 200 innings, Murphy had these rankings in these categories when he had concluded his career with Cincinnati: Category Stat Rank ERA 2.60 15th K/9 7.92 3rd K/BB 2.26 10th H/9 7.09 3rd SLG% .306 2nd Inh. Runners 21% 1st In Boston in 1989, Murphy collected career-highs with nine saves and 105.0 innings pitched behind closer Lee Smith in the Boston bullpen. Murphy‚Äôs 74 appearances eclipsed the team‚Äôs record for games pitched by a left-hander. The previous record was held by Sparky Lyle. His 105 innings pitched was also the most by a Red Sox left hander, strictly in relief, and the last time a left-handed pitcher threw over 100 innings, strictly in relief, in the American League. By pitching over 100 relief innings in both the American and National Leagues, Murphy joined a very short list of lefties to accomplish this feat. Only Darold Knowles and Ron Perranoski had done this before, both in 1970. Rob was named the Red Sox Fireman of the Year (best reliever) by the Boston area Baseball Writers. 1990 saw Murphy set a record for consecutive errorless games at start of career (332), previous record (175). The Red Sox won the Eastern Division of the American League. In 1992, Rob set a dubious record for consecutive games without a win (146). Murphy also pitched for the Mariners, Cardinals, Yankees, Dodgers and Marlins, retiring at the end of the 1995 season. In an eleven-season career, Murphy, compiled a 32‚Äì38 record with thirty saves and a 3.64 ERA in 597 games. At his retirement, he ranked eighteenth in the history of baseball for left-handed relief appearances, and had played longer in the Major Leagues than any player in University of Florida history. To this day, Murphy still leads all former Gator pitchers in years (11) and appearances (597), almost twice as many appearances as the next closest UF hurler. Murphy had also taken great pride in holding a lead, and stranding inherited runners left on base by his teammates. For National League pitchers with over 400 innings pitched, Rob stranded 78% of those runners which ranked him as the very best in that statistic when he retired in 1995. Currently, he is still in the top 5. Rob also held the lead his manager gave him over 91% of the time.  Life after baseball  A horse racing and thoroughbred enthusiast, Murphy has devised his own method for handicapping and breeding. Murphy's company, M375 Thoroughbreds, Inc., has bred, raised and raced such successful horses as Platinum Tiara, Swing and Miss, Diamond Studs, Strike Three and Golden Spikes. Murphy has also been active in charity fund-raising his career. While with the Reds, he participated in several Muscular Dystrophy Association telethons in the Cincinnati area. In Boston, Murphy worked with the Red Sox in-house charities, the Jimmy Fund and the 65 Roses Foundation. He also participated in events benefiting the ALS Association. Back at home in Florida, Murphy has attended many Redbone Organization events to benefit Cystic Fibrosis. Murphy continues to share his experience and expertise with the youth of Martin County by coaching baseball and softball players of all ages.

X, Section 4(a)-(b) of the Florida Constitution; # restrictions on devise and alienation, Art. X, Section 4(c) of the Florida Constitution; # and exemption from taxation per Art. VII, Section 6 of the Florida Constitution. Florida's homestead exemption that provides an exemption from forced sale before and at death are among the most protective in the United States as it provides no limit to the value of certain real property that can be protected from creditors. The property tax exemption clause of Article VI renders property tax-free to the extent of certain dollar amounts in the value of the homestead. The definition of a homestead is not necessarily co-extensive for Article X, Section 4(a)-(c) exemption purposes (exemption from creditors and restrictions on descent and distribution) and Article VI purposes (exemption from taxation). Both provisions apply automatically upon the establishment of a primary residence in Florida, but to reap the tax assessment benefits, the homestead exemption must be claimed by a filing with the local county property appraiser's office. Homestead can be lost if the homeowner abandons use of the real property as a homestead. A fourth benefit, while not as clearly an exemption as the above three, is also accorded to one's homestead in Florida per Art. VII, Section 7 of the Florida Constitution. For tax purposes the year-to-year increase in assessed value of the homestead is limited to the lesser of 3% or the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index. Scope of the Debtor Protection Florida's debtor protection homestead provision is one of the broadest in the United States. The value of the property that can be protected is unlimited, so long as the property occupies no more than one-half acre (2,000 sq m) within a municipality, or 160 acres (650,000 sq m) outside of a municipality. The provision is written into the Florida Constitution, Article X, section 4, so it cannot be removed without a constitutional amendment. Because of the scope of the protection afforded, persons from other states with heavy debts or large court judgments against them have been known to purchase expensive estates in Florida, one example being O.J. Simpson. This strategy has been somewhat impaired by the 2005 Bankruptcy Code amendments. One event that can drastically affect the value of a homestead is municipal incorporation. If a 160-acre (650,000 sq m) non-municipal homestead is on land that is later incorporated into a municipality, the homestead will be grandfathered in and remain protected for the owner and his heirs. However, for any future purchasers of all or part of the property, the protected land will drop to the one-half acre (2,000 sq m) allowed within a municipality. Protection from Creditors The Florida Constitutional homestead exemption offers virtually absolute protection from forced sale to meet the demands of creditors, except under four special circumstances, and should not be confused with the Florida Ad Valorem tax reduction savings, which is a product of the Florida legislature. One unique feature of Florida's homestead exemption is that it attaches to proceeds from the sale of a home if the homeowner intends to use those proceeds to establish a new Florida homestead within a reasonable time. Therefore, if the owner of a $1,000,000 home sells that home and puts the money in a bank account, that money is still protected by the homestead exemption, so long as the homeowner has a bona fide intent to use it to purchase another home in Florida entitled to the exemption within a reasonable period of time. This protection is lost if the funds are commingled with other funds not designated for such a purchase. Also, the protection only extends to the amount the owner intends to invest in a new homestead - if the owner of a $1,000,000 home sells that home, and makes clear his intent to purchase a $750,000 home, the remaining $250,000 will lose its protection. (Note: Florida Statute 222.25(4) provides that if the debtor does not claim or receive the benefits of a homestead exemption, the debtor may claim a $4,000 personal property exemption which is over and above the $1000 to which all debtors are entitled pursuant to Florida Statute 222.25(1). Furthermore, under Florida's tax lien sale provision, liens of less than $250 on homestead properties cannot be sold to investors.http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search;_String=&URL;=0100-0199/0197/Sections/0197.432.html Florida Statutes, Section 197.432(4) =Exceptions for Certain Creditors= Four types of creditors can still force the sale of a homestead to collect debts owed to them. These are: #The State of Florida and its counties or municipalities, to collect past due property taxes (this also applies to investors holding tax lien certificates, but note the above prohibition against sale of small liens on homestead properties); #Parties to whom the property was specifically pledged as collateral for a mortgage; #Mechanics who are owed money for work performed in repairing or improving the property. #Any creditor with a lien that pre-dates the establishment of homestead. This usually includes condominium and mandatory homeowner association liens, depending on the language and age of the covenants. Because the homestead exemption is a product of the Florida Constitution, it can also be overridden by the federal law due to the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. Federal income tax liens are superior to the homestead protection provided by the Florida Constitution. The Internal Revenue Service's policy is to be reluctant to foreclose on taxpayer's homes to enforce these liens, often only being satisfied if the real property is sold or mortgaged before the tax lien expires. Florida's Supreme Court recently held Florida's homestead exemption may be waived in the limited exception of a bankruptcy proceeding.http://works.bepress.com/shawn_gearhart/2 Reduction of Ad Valorem Property Tax The Great Depression began in 1929 and caused reforms in ad valorem property taxes in Florida. As the Depression deepened, many Florida property owners found themselves unable to pay their property taxes and in serious danger of losing their homes. In response to this problem, State Representative Dwight Rogers of Fort Lauderdale in 1933 proposed and passed legislation to place the $5,000 Homestead Exemption Amendment on the state ballot. Florida voters overwhelmingly approved the Homestead Exemption Amendment in 1934 (Article X, Section 7, as it was numbered before the 1968 Florida Constitutional re-write). The initial Homestead Exemption sought to ease the burden on homeowners by exempting property taxes on the first $5,000 of a homeowner's residence. The exemption was increased by the Florida Legislature to $10,000 during the 1960s, although this was not incorporated into the constitution. By Constitutional amendment adopted by a landslide in 1980, the exemption was increased to $25,000. On Jan. 29, 2008, voters approved an increase to $50,000 for non-school assessments, which is incorporated in Florida Statute ¬ß196.031. The reduction contained in Florida Statutes should not be confused by the Florida Constitution homestead exemption which protects the homestead from forced sale except under certain circumstances. Florida property tax homestead exemption reduces the value of a home for assessment of property taxes by $50,000, so a home that was actually worth $100,000 would be taxed as though it was worth only $50,000. However, the second $25,000 of homestead coverage does not apply to the school portion of property taxes, and only applies to the third $25,000 of a property's total value (i.e., that portion of a property's value between $50,000-$75,000). Additionally, the Florida homestead exemption caps the rate at which property assessments may be increased annually. Though millage rates may be changed, the assessed value a house with a homestead exemption can be increased by is fixed. This is the result of the \\"Save Our Homes\\" Amendment to the Florida Constitution which was passed by voters in 1992, and went into effect in 1995. The amendment caps the increase of the assessed value of a home with a homestead exemption to the lesser of 3% or the rate of inflation. This means that if an owner had a homestead exemption on a home valued at $100,000 in 1995, and the exemption was still valid in 2005, the most the home could be assessed at is approximately $126,000 . For comparison, records of the Florida Association of Realtors show the median price of a single family home during the same time increasing 138% from $86,000 in 1995 to $205,000 in 2005 Homestead exemptions are only available on an individual's primary home. Therefore, this exemption does not apply to businesses, rental property, second homes, homeowners claiming permanent residency-based exemptions or tax credits in other states, or homes with owners that do not claim Florida as their primary residence. Because of the \\"portability\\" provision of the January 2008 constitutional amendment, a homesteaded owner may now move up to $500,000 of the \\"Save Our Homes\\" benefit from one Florida home to the next. However, acquiring a house that had a homestead exemption does not entitle the buyer to retain the low tax rate enjoyed by the previous homesteaded resident, as homestead exemptions cannot be inherited or purchased. Supporters of the \\"Save Our Homes\\" Amendment contend that it allows long term residents with a fixed income to be able to afford to stay in their homes without being driven out by tax increases as their property value increases. Detractors argue that it creates an unfair system of taxation in which first time home buyers, new residents, seasonal residents, and businesses are burdened with more than their share of taxes while homesteaders are trapped in their own homes, often unable to move without doubling their tax rate. Under Florida law, the homestead exemption is only available to US citizens, permanent resident aliens, or others who are legally able to form the intent to remain permanently under immigration laws. For the taxation homestead exemption, \\"Persons Residing Under Color of Law\\" (a term created by the courts which applies to persons in the US with asylum or parole status, or someone who has applied for and completed the I-485 application process for a green card but is still awaiting final approval/issuance of the card). A person in the US under an E, H, L or R-class visa is not eligible for homestead, pursuant to Rule 12D-7.007(3), Florida Administrative Code. A person under an H or L visa who has an already approved I-140, and is awaiting USCIS retrogressions in order to submit the I-485 application, is not benefited with the homestead exemption. There is a loophole in the system, however. J-4 visa holders, who are spouses of J-1 visa holders, are assigned an Alien Number. Some counties accept alien numbers as part of the requirements to obtain a homestead exemption, although J visa holders cannot file for adjustment of status. Also, in general, a husband and wife in an intact marriage are treated as a single \\"family unit\\" under Florida law and are only entitled to a total of one homestead exemption no matter how many homes they own and occupy. Protection to surviving spouse or minor child The provision also protects a spouse in several ways. First, it restrains the homeowner from conveying the property without the approval of their spouse, even if the property is entirely in the name of one spouse, or was purchased entirely from funds of one spouse. The provision also prohibits a spouse from devising the property by will, if the homeowner is survived by a spouse or a minor child. If such a devise is made, it is deemed invalid, and the surviving spouse will enjoy a life estate with the remainder to the decedent's children. The surviving spouse may elect to take a 50% interest in lieu of the life estate as long as the election is made within six months of when the homeowner died. The election, in the form of a prescribed form, is recorded in the official record book of the county where the property lies, not with the probate court. If this election is made, the remaining 50% is inherited by the decedent's children. A spouse may waive these rights in writing with respect to the will, but a minor child is not competent to do so. Finally, the homestead exemption for property taxes automatically attaches to the surviving spouse, so the property will never be exposed to the creditors of either spouse because of the death of the other. Obtaining a Homestead Exemption for Property Taxes The elected Property Appraisers of Florida's 67 counties are the state constitutional officers responsible for maintaining the integrity of the homestead tax exemption program. No one in Florida \\"automatically\\" obtains a homestead exemption. Instead, a homeowner on title (or the beneficiary of a trust, a person legally or naturally dependent upon the owner or lessees having an original term of 98 years or more, all having to meet \\"equitable title to real estate\\" law) must file for a homestead exemption with the Property Appraiser in the county in which the property is located. While most counties still use paper applications, a few larger counties offer online homestead filing. While the applicable statutes are the same in all 67 counties, the standards applied vary greatly. Some Property Appraiser offices require significantly more documentation than others, as determining eligibility is a matter within the discretion of each appraiser.

It most often occurs where one player bets the clearly stronger hand and their opponent makes a mathematically poor call that wins with any subequent dealing to complete the hand. In pure mathematical terms a one-outer can be considered a pure bad beat, however there is no consensus however among poker players as to what else exactly constitutes a bad beat and often players will disagree about whether a particular hand was a bad beat. A few examples are: quads over full house, quads over quads, straight flush over quads, small full house vs. bigger full house or better. Types of bad beats Any hand that looked like a favorite to win can end up losing as more cards are dealt (with the nuts being the exception), but bad beats usually involve one of two not mutually exclusive scenarios: *The player who wins on a bad beat is rewarded for mathematically unsound play. Calling a bet despite having neither the best hand nor the right pot odds or implied odds to call, then winning anyway, is characteristic of this type of bad beat. It can also involve the inferior hand catching running cards when it requires two cards in a row to come from behind to win the pot. For example, catching cards on both the turn and the river in Texas hold 'em that complete a straight or flush. *A very strong hand loses to an even stronger one, better known as \\"cooler\\". This type of beat occurs with some frequency in movies. In the films The Cincinnati Kid and Casino Royale, The Kid and Le Chiffre each lose with a full house to a straight flush. In this situation, it is possible that both players have played their cards well, and avoiding the bad beat could not have been achieved without committing a mistake. Reacting to bad beats A bad beat can be a profound psychological blow, and can easily lead to a player going on tilt. Professional player Phil Hellmuth, among others, is notorious for his pronounced reactions to bad beats. However, suffering a bad beat means that the losing player was \\"getting the money in good\\" and in most instances would win by playing the same hand the same way. Thus, the more stoic poker players accept bad beats as an unpleasant but necessary drawback to a tactic that works the vast majority of the time. Bad beats online In online poker rooms, bad beats often lead to accusations that the random number generator is \\"rigged\\", even though such beats also occur in offline games. Many online poker rooms post statistical data to demonstrate the randomness of the hands generated.PokerStars: Random Number Generator Audits In online poker games players have an opportunity to play in \\"bad beat\\" tables where the player who has the best losing hand receives an accumulated prize pool. An additional amount of rake is taken from each hand to fund the jackpot. The largest online jackpot to date was ‚Ç¨1.25 million, hit in July 2011 with ‚Ç¨443,000 going to the loser of the hand.Boss Media's Bad Beat Jackpot is Finally Hit Players are statistically more likely to experience bad beats online, since playing using a computer allows for more hands played per hour. Also, online players may play multiple cash game tables and/or tournaments at the same time, also increasing the frequency of hands dealt. Also, tells are rendered moot, so players are incapable of reading clues such as body language in aid of deriving the strength of an opponent's hand. Finally, online poker games (especially freeroll tournaments) are far more accessible to the average player who, being average, is less likely to be knowledgeable regarding the techniques of the game, in turn making it more likely they will bet from the gut or intuition rather than experience. Bad beat jackpot A bad beat jackpot is a prize that is paid when a sufficiently strong hand is shown down and loses to an even stronger hand held by another player. Not all poker games offer bad beat jackpots, and those that do have specific requirements for how strong a losing hand must be to qualify for the jackpot. For example, the losing hand may be required to be four-of-a-kind or better. There may be additional requirements as well. For example, in Texas hold 'em there is usually a requirement that both hole cards play in both the losing and winning hands, or that where a full house is the minimum (usually aces full of jacks or higher), both hole cards must be used to make the three- of-a-kind in the full house. Bad beat jackpots are usually progressive, often with a small rake being taken out of each pot to fund the jackpot (in addition to the regular rake). When a jackpot is won, it is usually split among all players sitting at the table at the time of the bad beat with the losing hand getting the largest share, followed by the winning hand, and all the other players dividing the remainder. Generally, only the best losing hand is eligible to win the largest share, even if another hand would also qualify. Specific rules, collections, payout percentages, and amounts vary greatly from one casino or cardroom to the next, and are sometimes changed.

It is found worldwide.  Description This species has a monoxenous life cycle with the only definitive host as chickens; it is extremely host-specific. Acquired via fecal contamination of food and water (oral-fecal route), it undergoes endogenous merogony in the crypts of Lieberkuhn (intestinal ceca of chicken) and gametogony in epithelial cells of the small intestines. Fusion of microgamete and macrogamete forms results in unsporulated zygotes, which are released with feces of chicken. The zygote sporulates after one to five days, and becomes infective. Diagnosis is based on finding oocysts in feces. While no effective treatment exists, the rate of infection can be reduced via prophylactics, anticoccidial drugs and vaccination of baby chicks. Life cycle Eimeria tenella has a monogenetic life cycle, that is, the life cycle involves a single host. Various stages of its complicated life cycle may conveniently be described under two phases, asexual cycle or schizogony and sexual cycle involving gametogony. Much of life cycle is intracellular. It is one of seven protozoan parasites that cause avian coccidiosis in poultry. Acquiring the infection The unsporulated oocyst is shed from an infected bird in the feces. This exposure to air and moisture triggers meiosis and cell division. After 9‚Äì12 hours of sporulation (asexual reproduction by the production and release of spores) eight haploid sporozoites are formed. It has completed the sporulation stage after about 24 hours and can now infect a new host. =Schizogony= The chicken ingests the sporozoite where it is stripped of its oocyst wall by abrasion in the gizzard and breakdown in the lumen of the small intestine. The sporozoite then migrates to its preferred site of development (the caeca in the case of Eimeria tenella) and invades the villus enterocyte. It then migrates to the crypt of the villus where it will complete development. There are two generations of schizonts and merozoites which are morphologically distinguishable. The sporozoites undergo two waves of schizogeny (asexual reproduction) in the crypts and produce many first and second generation merozoites. These merozoites can invade locally and reproduce themselves to produce a smaller variety of schizonts. The sporozoites are then shed in the feces and the process begins again. Infection by sporozoites The beginning of complex life cycle of Eimeria tenella may be taken to be initiated by infection of epithelial cells of host cecum by sporozoites. The infected fowl passes out oocysts or zygocysts with fecal matter. When their oocysts are swallowed by a new or healthy bird, its gizzard and digestive juices dissolve the cystwall and release sporozoites which enter the host epithelial cells. Within the epithelial cells, the sporozoites grow in size and multiply by schizogony. Sporozoite It is the earliest intracellular stage of parasite. It is elongated, slightly curved, microscopic unicellular organism with one end pointed and the other end blunt. The pellicle, forming external envelope, contains longitudinally arranged contractile microtubules which help in wriggling movements of organism. Cytoplasm includes a vesicular nucleus, a mitochondrion, golgi bodies, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, lysosomes and vacuoles containing reserve food, etc. Penetration of sporozoite into host epithelial cell is facilitated by the lytic secretion stored in roptries of parasite. The measurement of body is as 19.5‚Äì25 by 16.5‚Äì23 micrometer.

The drama features Robert Mitchum, Jane Russell, William Bendix, and Gloria Grahame. Plot Three strangers arrive at the port of Macao on the same ship: Nick Cochran (Robert Mitchum), a cynical-but- honest ex-serviceman, Julie Benson (Jane Russell), an equally cynical, sultry night club singer, and Lawrence Trumble (William Bendix), a traveling salesman who deals in both silk stockings and contraband. Corrupt police lieutenant Sebastian (Thomas Gomez) notifies casino owner and underworld boss Vincent Halloran (Brad Dexter) about the new arrivals. Halloran has been tipped off about an undercover New York City policeman out to lure him into international waters so he can be arrested. With only three strangers to choose from, Halloran assumes Nick is the cop. He tries to bribe a puzzled Nick to leave Macao, but Nick is interested in getting to know Julie better and turns him down. Halloran hires Julie as a singer, in part to find out what she knows about Nick. Later, Trumble offers Nick a commission to help him sell a stolen diamond necklace. However, when Nick shows Halloran a diamond from the necklace, Halloran recognizes it; he had sent the jewelry to Hong Kong only a week earlier to be sold. Now sure of Nick's identity, he has the American taken prisoner for later questioning. Nick is guarded by two thugs and Halloran's jealous girlfriend, Margie (Gloria Grahame). Worried that Halloran is planning to dump her for Julie, Margie lets Nick escape, with the two guards close behind. When Trumble happens on the late-night chase, he tries to help Nick and is killed, mistaken by the thugs for Nick. Before he dies, he tells Nick about the police boat waiting offshore. When Nick tries to get Julie to go away with him, he learns that Halloran has invited her on a trip to Hong Kong (to retrieve his property). With this information, Nick is able to dispose of Halloran's murderous henchman, Itzumi (Philip Ahn), and take the helm of Halloran's boat. He steers for the waiting police and hands Halloran over to them. Cast * Robert Mitchum as Nick Cochran * Jane Russell as Julie Benton * William Bendix as Lawrence C. Trumble * Thomas Gomez as Lt.

Lordship, Non-Lordship and Dispensationalism. The Founders Journal: An Attempt at Self-Identification, Spring, (8), 11. or Bullingerism) (to which ultradispensationalism properly applies) is a Protestant conservative evangelical movement that values biblical inerrancy and a literal hermeneutic. Opponents of hyperdispensationalism are traditional dispensationalists, like John Walvoord and Charles Ryrie,Dispensationalist theology#Traditional dispensationalism classic Acts 2 Pauline dispensationalists, and ultradispensationalists. Within the United States, some advocates of hyperdispensationalism refer to themselves as members of the Grace Movementhttp://www.biblicaladvancedbasics.com/pdf/Grace.pdf and they reject the prefix \\"hyper\\" or \\"ultra\\" as pejorative or misinforming). Many affiliate with the Grace Gospel Fellowship, a church association, and its Grace Christian University or the more conservative Berean Bible Society. General views Hyperdispensationalism holds that the early Christian Church lost four basic truths starting near the end of the Apostle Paul‚Äôs ministry. The four truths are (in order of loss): # The Distinctive Message and Ministry of the Apostle Paul # The Pre-Tribulational Rapture of the Church, the Body of Christ # The Difference between Israel and the Church, the Body of Christ # Justification by Faith Alone, in Christ Alone. The truths, advocates say, were gradually recovered in reverse order starting during the Reformation. For example, Martin Luther is credited with recovery of \\"justification by faith\\" and John Nelson Darby with \\"Church Truth\\". Hyperdispensationalists reject water baptism, (along with charismatic gifts, prophets, and apostles) which divides them from mainstream dispensationalists who are often Baptists, like W. A. Criswell, or in earlier times Presbyterians like James H. Brookes. So instead of various water baptisms, they believe in the baptism made without hands and without water by the Spirit which occurs when one believes in Christ as their Savior whereby one is identified with Christ's death, burial, and resurrection.Romans 6:3-4; 1 Corinthians 12:12-13; 2 Corinthians 1:21-22; 2 Corinthians 5:5; Galatians 3:27; Ephesians 1:12-14; Ephesians 4:5; Ephesians 4:30; Colossians 2:11-12; Hebrews 9:8-10 While hyperdispensationalists reject water baptism like ultradispensationalists, they still practice the Lord's Supper as a memorial and not as an ordinance. (Ultradispensationalists also reject the Lord's Supper and water baptism.) Hyperdispensationalists are not monolithic nor homogenous. There are two main positions, as well as a few other minor variations. The two main positions are Acts 9 and Acts 13. The differences are minor being only technical. They all see the dispensation of Grace which is the church age as beginning with the Apostle Paul. Also, within the movement is found King James only elements associated mainly with the teachings of Richard Jordan and Grace School of the Bible. While the Acts 2 position tries to distance itself from its more consistent dispensational brothers, as well as, ultradispensationalism (starts the church after Acts 28), they are all true dispensationalists and fully evangelical still tending towards fundamentalism. Furthermore, the differences separating the Mid-Acts position from the Acts 28 position are just as great as those separating the Acts 2 position from its more consistent Mid-Acts dispensational brothers. Divisions Early ultradispensationalism (Acts 28 dispensationalism), like that promoted by E. W. Bullinger, emphasized a dispensational boundary, as in Acts 28:28, but did not apply this boundary line to the Pauline epistles. Unlike Bullinger, Robert Anderson posited a Pentecostal dispensation during the period covered by the Book of Acts. Bullinger considered that the Pauline epistles, as a whole, whether or not they were written before or after Acts 28:28 in almost all of his writings. Bullinger thus had not applied his Acts 28 position consistently to his exposition of Paul's epistles until later in life and then only in one book. Thus, most of his books had already been published, along with the writings of Robert Anderson, view Paul's epistles monolithically and are then quite compatible with Mid-Acts hyperdispensationalism. The Mid-Acts position and the Acts 28 position differ mainly on when the normative portion of Paul's ministry to the church began. Both hyperdispensationalism and ultradispensationalism see the Gospel accounts as for Israel in the Mosaic dispensation. Mid-Acts types take all of Paul's epistles to be directly written to the church, thus accepting the practice of the Lord's Supper as for that dispensation of grace, but the Acts 28 position takes only Paul's prison epistles (those written while in prison after Acts 28) to be directly applicable to the church today, thus denying the Lord's Supper for today. There is only one baptism made without hands in which the believer is baptized into Christ by the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:13), which is held in contradistinction to Christ baptizing believing Israel in Acts 2 with the Holy Spirit. The pouring-out baptism of the Holy Spirit is in fulfillment of the Old Testament promise of the New Covenant to Israel. Thus, it has nothing to do with the newly-revealed mystery to and through the apostle Paul, who is not sent out until years later with the new ministry to the gentiles to establish a new church which is composed of both believing Israelites and believing gentiles, not just Israelites (which includes proselytes to Judaism), as in Acts 2. Paul, it is specifically noted, was sent to preach the gospel but not to baptize, unlike notably the Lord's commission to his apostles. The new church is not obligated to any Jewish rituals (like water baptism), according to the determination of the Council of Jerusalem recorded in Acts 15. Bullinger held that Paul's authoritative teaching began after the conclusion of the Book of Acts, a viewpoint that is now characterized as Acts 28 ultradispensationalism (chapter 28 being the concluding chapter of the book). The position was first suggested by J.B. Cole\\"The Acts of the Apostles Considered Historically and Dispensationally\\" in Things To Come Journal, Vol. 13, No.152, February 1907 and later solidified by Charles H. Welch. The Mid-Acts position was developed independently in America later by J.C. O'Hair and followed later by Cornelius R. Stam and Charles F. Baker, among others, and reflects their position that Paul's normative ministry began with Paul's ministry with his salvation in Acts 9 (Stam) or with Paul's commission in Acts 13 (O'Hair, Baker). A very few independent spirits have staked the beginning of the church in a few other chapters, but such differences are technical, preferences rather than disagreements. The hallmark is that the church is served uniquely with Paul's ministry and upon that, there is a complete agreement. Acts is seen as a transitional period between dispensations, and the Mid-Acts position does not insert an extra dispensation there (contra Ryrie), as did Anderson. John Nelson Darby, the father of dispensationalism, believes that the church began at Pentecost, but his dispensational scheme is not like Scofield's and later American dispensationalists (except classic Pauline dispensationalism). It is also unlike that of hyperdispensationalists. The church does not begin with a new dispensation for Darby, as the administrations upon Earth are not relevant for the heavenly church body. One can study R.A. Huebner, who sees the Church's advent at Acts 2, to get a better understanding of Darby's scheme of dispensations which is different than Scofield's. Also, Miles J. Stanford (classic Pauline dispensationalism) follows Darby's dispensational scheme and criticizes Acts 28 as well as Mid-Acts dispensationalists for not following Darby. Stanford drew heavily upon Darby's soteriology of \\"spiritual growth\\" and considered himself a \\"classic Pauline dispensationalist\\" in the line of the Plymouth Brethren Darbyite dispensationalists.http://www.pembrokebiblechapel.com/pdf/PaulineDispensationalismStanford.pdf However, classic (Pauline) dispensationalism's earliest teachers (Darbyite) were the source for J.C. O'Hair's consistent dispensational doctrines, but he seems to have adopted Scofield's dispensational scheme, adapting it to the Mid-Acts position.http://www.ggfusa.org/images/truthmag/GraceMovementOrigins.pdf, page 6 of pdf Also, early Calvinism does not seem to be in evidence so much today and is being fully rejected in more and more churches.For the influence of the Grace Movement group, see the Grace History Project Lesson 124 pdf notes Addendum http://www.gracelifebiblechurch.com/SundaySchool/ChurchHistory/2014/012614/Lesson%20124%20The%20Life%20and%20Ministry%20of%20C.%20Richard%20Jordan%20The%20Formation%20of%20Grace%20School%20of%20the%20Bible.pdf, http://gracehistoryproject.blogspot.com/2014/02/lesson-125-life-and-ministry- of-c.html If Darby appears to be followed more closely by hyperdispensationalism, Darby's dispensationalism and hyperdispensationalism are more consistent than American Acts 2 dispensationalism in marking Scripture's distinction between national Israel, with its earthly kingdom, from the Church, which is Christ's heavenly body. Here too, hyperdispensationalism and ultradispensationalism may be seen to make more than a mere distinction between Israel and the Church, but classic (Pauline) dispensationalism (Acts 2) is as extreme, if not more so, in making rather a separation between Israel and the Church. O'Hair followed more closely to the early American dispensationalists and abandoned denominational loyalties. Rejecting gifts for the Church age led to a rejection of water baptism and the Acts 2 position. He then began to explore Acts 28 as an alternative but eventually rejected that as well. It was then that H.A. Ironside wrote, \\"Wrongly Dividing the Word of Truth,\\" confusing O'Hair with Bullinger's teachings. Later, O'Hair settled upon the Mid-Acts position.http://www.gracehistoryproject.blogspot.com/ Most notable proponents The most notable proponents of the Mid-Acts view were J.C. O'Hair, Charles Baker, and C.R. Stam.\\"Dispensational Theology\\" by Charles F. Baker, p. 16, Grace Publications, 1971]. The Mid-Acts dispensational viewpoint is also shared on many current television programs, including \\"Forgotten Truths\\" with Richard Jordan, \\"Through the Bible\\" with Les Feldick, and \\"Transformed by Grace\\" with Kevin Sadler.http://www.lesfeldick.org/les- tv.htmlhttp://www.forgottentruths.com/https://www.bereanbiblesociety.org/transformed/ See also * Pauline Christianity References Sources * Baker, Charles F., A Dispensational Theology, 1971, Grace Bible College Publications, Grand Rapids, Michigan. * Stam, Cornelius R., Things That Differ, 1951, Berean Bible Society, Germantown, Wisconsin.

It opened in 1978 as the Stony Brook University Fine Arts Center before being renamed in October 1988 after a $1.8 million donation from the Staller family. Located on the main campus of Stony Brook University, it consists of two main divisions. One section houses the music and art departments, while the other consists of the theatre, media, and dance departments. The Staller Center contains three black-box theatres, a recital hall, the Paul W. Zuccaire Gallery and a professional 1,000-seat performance stage that features a 40-foot movie screen and is the site of the Stony Brook Film Festival. The Staller Center has hosted several nationwide events such as the New York Science Fiction Forum in 1998 and more recently the Live Action Role Playing League's production of A Link to the Past. The black-box theaters are used by the theater arts department and Pocket Theater Club for stage performances of plays. The Staller Center has hosted speakers ranging from Bob Woodward, Margaret Jay, Baroness Jay of Paddington, Stephanie Kelton and Spike Lee.  History  In 1972, New York state legislature approved nearly $10 million for the construction of Phase 1 of the Stony Brook University Fine Arts Center, which was estimated to cost $15 million. Phase 1 of the Fine Arts Center opened in 1975, consisting of classrooms, offices, rehearsal halls, a foundry, studios, and an art gallery. On November 11, 1977, the Bridge to Nowhere officially opened following ten years of construction; the bridge connected Phase 1 of the Fine Arts Center with the Student Union and the Frank Melville Jr. Memorial Library. Phase II of the Fine Arts Center opened in 1979. The Phase II complex consisted of the Theatre Arts and Art Gallery, experimental theatre, two ‚Äòblack box theatres,‚Äô a recital hall, and a 1200-seat concert hall. The Fine Arts Center was damaged by winter weather in January 1981. The first Bach Aria Festival was held at the Fine Arts Center in June 1981, and the festival would become an annual event until 1997. In October 1988, the Fine Arts Center was renamed the Staller Center for the Arts after a $1.8 million donation from the Staller family, including real estate mogul Max Staller. The donation was the largest ever private donation given to the university at the time. In 1993, the Staller Center was flooded after a water main break in February, and it would reopen in May. Since 1996, the Staller Center for the Arts has produced the annual Stony Brook Film Festival. The festival attracts crowds of over 15,000 and takes place over a span of ten days, with films being shown in the Main Stage theater. The Stony Brook University Art Gallery was renamed to the Paul W. Zuccaire Gallery on April 4, 2013, in honor of Alice Zuccaire and the Paul W. Zuccaire Foundation. The Zuccaire Gallery is a 5,000-square foot space that showcases professional and student exhibitions.  Description  The Staller Center has five theaters as well as the Paul W. Zuccaire Gallery, which is over 5,000 square feet. The Main Stage theater contains a 40-foot screen and seats approximately 1,050, the Recital Hall seats 380, while the three black box theaters seat from 75 to 225.

It is the second book in Card's The Tales of Alvin Maker series and is about Alvin Miller, the seventh son of a seventh son. Red Prophet won the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel in 1989, was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1988, and the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1989.Hugo Awards 1989 Setting The book takes place in an alternate version of America where people have special abilities known as \\"knacks\\". The characters are caught up in a plot with ramifications on the entire future of America involving alternate versions of Tenskwa-Tawa (the \\"prophet\\"), Ta- Kumsaw, William Henry Harrison, and even Napoleon and La Fayette. Plot summary Lolla-Wossiky, a troubled, one-eyed, whiskey \\"Red\\", leaves General Harrison's fort and heads north in order to find his \\"dream beast\\", the spirit that can save him from the pain of his memories. On his journey, he meets Alvin Miller Jr. and assists him in making an ethical decision that will shape his life forever. In appreciation, Alvin heals Lolla-Wossiky's painful memories, allowing him to give up alcohol and become in touch with the land once again. Lolla-Wossiky grows into \\"the Prophet\\" although he prefers to be known as Tenskwa-Tawa. Lolla-Wossiky preaches both pacifism and separatism, believing that \\"Reds\\" should live west of the Mississippi and \\"Whites\\" should live east of it. Meanwhile, Lolla-Wossiky's brother, Ta-Kumsaw, tries to rally \\"Reds\\" behind his belief that their land should be defended violently. When Alvin Miller Jr. and his older brother Measure travel to the place of his birth (where Alvin is expected to become apprenticed to the Hatrack River blacksmith) the two brothers are captured by 'Reds' (Native Americans) sent by William Henry Harrison to intentionally create conflict. Ta-Kumsaw, sent by Lolla-Wossiky, rescues the brothers from torture and death. Measure leaves the \\"Reds\\" only to be captured by William Henry Harrison's men and subsequently beaten to the brink of death. Ta-Kumsaw accompanies Alvin to the holy site of Eight-Face Mound where they meet up with Taleswapper, an old friend of Alvin. Using the spiritual powers of the Eight-Face Mound, Alvin is able to heal Measure from afar. Measure is then able to stop some of the slaughter of Lolla-Wossiky's followers by villagers and William Henry Harrison's men over the alleged kidnapping and murder of Alvin and Measure Miller.

It was written in Persian, which is the literary language of the Mughals, and includes vivid and detailed descriptions of his life and times.Illustration from the Akbarnama: History of Akbar Art Institute of Chicago It followed the Baburnama, the more personal memoir by his grandfather, Babur, founder of the dynasty. Like that, it was produced in the form of lavishly illustrated manuscripts. Akbar's mother travels by boat to Agra, Victoria and Albert Museum The work was commissioned by Akbar, and written by Abul Fazl, one of the Nine Jewels (Hindi: Navaratnas) of Akbar's royal court. It is stated that the book took seven years to be completed. The original manuscripts contained many miniature paintings supporting the texts, thought to have been illustrated between c. 1592 and 1594 by at least forty-nine different artists from Akbar's studio, representing the best of the Mughal school of painting, and masters of the imperial workshop, including Basawan, whose use of portraiture in its illustrations was an innovation in Indian art.Illustration from the Akbarnama: History of Akbar Art Institute of Chicago After Akbar's death in 1605, the manuscript remained in the library of his son, Jahangir (r. 1605-1627) and later Shah Jahan (r. 1628‚Äì1658). Today, the illustrated manuscript of Akbarnma, with 116 miniature paintings, is at the Victoria and Albert Museum. It was bought by the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A;) in 1896 from Mrs Frances Clarke, acquired by her husband upon his retirement from serving as Commissioner of Oudh (1858‚Äì1862). Soon after, the paintings and illuminated frontispiece were removed from the volume to be mounted and framed for display. Volumes I and II The first volume of Akbarnama deals with the birth of Akbar, the history of Timur's family and the reigns of Babur and Humayun and the Suri sultans of Delhi. Volume one of Akbarnama encompasses Akbar's birth and his upbringings. According to the Abul Fazl Humayun, the second Mughal emperor and Akbar's father is praying to the Ka'ba, an Islamic holy place, for a successor to the Mughal empire. After this prayer, Maryam Makani showcases different signs that she is pregnant with Akbar such as having a shining forehead that others believe to be a mirror on her face or the warmth and joy that enters her bosom when a light shines on her. Miryam believes the light to be God's Light blessing her and her unborn child. Nine months later while Humayuan is away, Maryam gives birth to Akbar under what is considered an auspicious star and there is great celebration.https://hdl.handle.net/2027/inu.30000125233498. \\"The Akbarnama of Abu-l-Fazl\\" Translation from Persian by H. Beveridge. The second volume describes the detailed history of the reign of Akbar till 1602 and records the events during Akbar's reign. It also deals with how Bairam Khan and Akbar won the battle of Panipat against Hemu an Indian warrior. Volume III: The Ain-i- Akbari Akbar on a hunt Mughal Emperor Akbar crossing the river at night. The third volume, called the ', describes the administrative system of the Empire as well as containing the famous \\"Account of the Hindu Sciences\\". It also deals with Akbar's household, army, the revenues and the geography of the empire. It also produces rich details about the traditions and culture of the people living in India. It is famous for its rich statistical details about things as diverse as crop yields, prices, wages and revenues. Here Abu'l Fazl's ambition, in his own words, is: \\"It has long been the ambitious desire of my heart to pass in review to some extent, the general conditions of this vast country, and to record the opinions professed by the majority of the learned among the Hindus. I know not whether the love of my native land has been the attracting influence or exactness of historical research and genuine truthfulness of narrative...\\" (ƒÄin-i-Akbarƒ´, translated by Heinrich Blochmann and Colonel Henry Sullivan Jarrett, Volume III, pp 7). In this section, he expounds the major beliefs of the six major Hindu philosophical schools of thought, and those of the Jains, Buddhists, and NƒÅstikas. He also gives several Indian accounts of geography, cosmography, and some tidbits on Indian aesthetic thought. Most of this information is derived from Sanskrit texts and knowledge systems. Abu'l Fazl admits that he did not know Sanskrit and it is thought that he accessed this information through intermediaries, likely Jains who were favoured at Akbar's court. In his description of Hinduism, Abu‚Äôl Fazl tries to relate everything back to something that the Muslims could understand. Many of the orthodox Muslims thought that the Hindus were guilty of two of the greatest sins, polytheism and idolatry.Andrea; Overfield: ‚ÄúA Muslim‚Äôs Description of Hindu Beliefs and Practices,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Human Record,‚Äù page 61. On the topic of idolatry, Abu‚Äôl Fazl says that the symbols and images that the Hindus carry are not idols but merely are there to keep their minds from wandering. He writes that only serving and worshipping God is required.Fazl, A: ‚ÄúAkbarnama,‚Äù Andrea; Overfield: ‚ÄúThe Human Record,‚Äù page 62. Abul Fazl also describes the Caste system to his readers. He writes the name, rank, and duties of each caste. He then goes on to describe the sixteen subclasses which come from intermarriage among the main four.Fazl, A: ‚ÄúAkbarnama,‚Äù Andrea; Overfield: ‚ÄúThe Human Record,‚Äù page 63. Abu‚Äôl Fazl next writes about Karma about which he writes, ‚ÄúThis is a system of knowledge of an amazing and extraordinary character, in which the learned of Hindustan concur without dissenting opinion.‚Äù He places the actions and what event they bring about in the next life into four different kinds. First, he writes many of the different ways in which a person from one class can be born into a different class in the next life and some of the ways in which a change in gender can be brought about. He classifies the second kind as the different diseases and sicknesses one suffers from. The third kind is actions which cause a woman to be barren or the death of a child. And the fourth kind deals with money and generosity, or lack thereof.Fazl, A: ‚ÄúAkbarnama,‚Äù Andrea; Overfield: ‚ÄúThe Human Record,‚Äù page 63-64. The Ain-i-Akbari is currently housed in the Hazarduari Palace, in West Bengal. The Akbarnama of Faizi Sirhindi The Akbarnama of Shaikh Illahdad Faiz Sirhindi is another contemporary biography of the Mughal emperor Akbar. This work is mostly not original and basically a compilation from the Tabaqat-i-Akbari of Khwaja Nizam-ud-Din Ahmad and the more famous Akbarnama of Abu¬¥l Fazl. The only original elements in this work are a few verses and some interesting stories. Very little is known about the writer of this Akbarnama. His father Mulla Ali Sher Sirhindi was a scholar and Khwaja Nizam-ud-Din Ahmad, the writer of the Tabaqat-i-Akbari was his student. He lived in Sirhind sarkar of Delhi Subah and held a madad-i-ma¬¥ash (a land granted by the state for maintenance) village there. He accompanied his employer and patron Shaikh Farid Bokhari (who held the post of the Bakhshi-ul- Mulk) on his various services. His most important work is a dictionary, the Madar-ul-Afazil, completed in 1592. He started writing this Akbarnama at the age of 36 years. His work also ends in 1602 like the one of Abu¬¥l Fazl. This work provides us with some additional information regarding the services rendered by Shaikh Farid Bokhari. It also provides valuable information regarding the siege and capture of Asirgarh.Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2007). The Mughul Empire, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, , p.7 Translations * Beveridge Henry.

Prior to this, the current modern symbol/logo of the Sikhs was not used in any Gurdwara or anywhere else. The symbols/logos of Sikhs have changed over time, but Sikhs have always focused on, and should always focus on \\"Ek Onkar\\" and \\"Sat Sri Akal\\" and what these phrases mean, rather than focusing on a symbol/logo. The modern Sikh symbol/logo is never written on or in any copy of the Guru Granth Sahib. The main symbol/logo traditionally used in the Guru Granth Sahib and Gurdwaras across the world is \\"Ek Onkar\\". Tradionally, it was very common to see \\"Ek Onkar\\" above the entrance to a Gurdwara, or on the front page of the Guru Granth Sahib. It is an amalgam of three symbols: * A double-edged khanda (sword) in the centre * A chakkar (chakram) * Two single-edged swords, or kirpan, crossed at the bottom, which sit on either side of the khanda and chakkar. They represent the dual characteristics of Miri-Piri, indicating the integration of both spiritual and temporal sovereignty together and not treating them as two separate and distinct entities. It depicts the Sikh doctrine Deg Tegh Fateh in emblematic form. It consists of three weapons and a circle: the khanda, two kirpans and the chakkar which is a circle. It is the military emblem of the Sikhs. It is also part of the design of the Nishan Sahib. A double edged khanda (sword) is placed at the top of a Nishan Sahib flag as an ornament or finial. In recent years, the Khanda has been used to show solidarity within the Sikh community after high profile shootings in the United States.Nolan, Bruce. \\"Sikhs in New Orleans gather for Milwaukee shooting victims\\", The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, 08 August 2012.

Eimeria species are considered to be monoxenous because the life cycle is completed within a single host, and stenoxenous because they tend to be host specific, although a number of exceptions have been identified. Species of this genus infect a wide variety of hosts. Thirty- one species are known to occur in bats (Chiroptera), two in turtles, and 130 named species infect fish. Two species (E. phocae and E. weddelli) infect seals. Five species infect llamas and alpacas: E. alpacae, E. ivitaensis, E. lamae, E. macusaniensis, and E. punonensis. A number of species infect rodents, including E. couesii, E. kinsellai, E. palustris, E. ojastii and E. oryzomysi. Others infect poultry (E. necatrix and E. tenella), rabbits (E. stiedae) and cattle (E. bovis, E. ellipsoidalis, and E. zuernii). For full species list, see below. The most prevalent species of Eimeria that cause coccidiosis in cattle are E. bovis, E. zuernii, and E. auburnensis. In a young, susceptible calf it is estimated that as few as 50,000 infective oocysts can cause severe disease. Eimeria infections are particularly damaging to the poultry industry and costs the United States more than $1.5 billion in annual loses. The most economically important species among poultry are E. tenella, E. acervulina, and E. maxima. The oocysts of what was later called Eimeria steidai were first seen by the pioneering Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632‚Äì1723) in the bile of a rabbit in 1674. The genus is named after the German zoologist Theodor Eimer (1843‚Äì1898). Life cycle The Eimeria life cycle has an exogenous phase, during which the oocysts are excreted into the environment, and an endogenous phase, where parasite development occurs in the host intestine. During the endogenous phase, several rounds of asexual reproduction, or schizogony take place, after which the sexual differentiation of gametes and fertilisation occurs. Parasite transmission occurs via the oral-fecal route. Infections are common in farming environments where many animals are confined in a small space. Eimeria life cycle =Oocysts= There are two forms of oocyst: sporulated or late oocyst, and unsporulated or early oocyst. An infected host releases oocysts into the environment in their unsporulated form. These contain a multi-layered cell wall making them highly resistant to environmental pressures. Once released, the unsporulated oocysts undergo meiosis upon contact with oxygen and moisture. This process is known as sporulation and the oocysts take approximately 2 to 7 days to become infectious. The sporulated oocyst is said to be tetrasporic meaning it contains four sporocysts, while each sporocyst is dizoic, i.e. it contains two sporozoites. Once ingested, the oocysts undergo a process called excystation, whereby thousands of sporozoites are released into lumen of the intestine. In the case of E. tenella, this process is thought to occur due to the combination of enzymatic degradation and mechanical abrasion of the oocyst wall in the chicken's gizzard. =Sporozoites= The motile sporozoites invade the enterocytes of small intestine, and migrate to their respective sites of development. Invasion is mediated through specialised membrane-bound structures on the surface of the parasite that release secretions. This results in the recognition of, and attachment to host cell receptors. This process is known as gliding motility, which is conserved across all species of Apicomplexa. Membrane glyconjugates have been proposed as potential host cell receptors for Eimeria species. After invasion, the sporozoites develop into trophozoites, then into schizonts, where they undergo several rounds of asexual reproduction. This results in many nuclei developing within the schizont. Each nucleus develops into a merozoite. Invasion requires the formation of a moving junction between parasite and host cell membranes. In E. tenella, this involves parasite micronemes and rhoptry proteins including RON2, RON5 and AMA-2. It is unlikely that the host cell is completely passive in the invasion process, although evidence of host physical forces that assist in mediating parasite entry remains controversial. =Merozoites= When schizonts rupture, merozoites are released, which either go on to re-infect more enterocytes or develop into either male or female gametes via the process of gametogenesis. These gametes fuse to form an oocyst, which is then released in its non-infectious, unsporulated form through the faeces of the host. Merozoite invasion also requires the formation of a moving junction, however the proteins involved in this process differs from those on sporozoites. Rhoptry proteins AMA-1 and RON4 are found exclusively on merozoites. There is also a greater diversity of variant surface antigens found on the surface of merozoites. It is hypothesised that this may be due to the fact that merozoites are short-lived and a greater antigen repertoire would permit faster binding and invasion.  Taxonomy  Evolutionary relationships among Apicomplexa The Eimeria lie within the family Eimeriidae. Eimeria accounts for close to 75% of the species within this family, and it is the most specious of the genera of the Apicomplexa with 1,700 described species. Attempts to subdivide this large taxonomic unit into separate genera have been made. The classification of eimeriid coccidian was largely based on morphological and life cycle details. More recently, classification has been done using rDNA and mitochondrial genes, which indicate Eimeria may be paraphyletic to Isospora and Cyclospora Eimeria: These species are tetrasporocystic with dizoic, nonbivalved sporocysts with or without Stieda bodies. This new genus retains the majority of the species. Goussia (Labbe 1896): These species are tetrasporocystic, dizoic, lack Stieda bodies, and have sporocyst walls consisting of two valves joined by a longitudinal suture. This genus contains about 20 species. Crystallospora (Thelohan 1893): The species in this genus is tetrasporocystic and dizoic, and have dodecahedral sporocysts composed of two hexagonal, pyrimidal valves joined at their bases by a suture. This genus contains a single species, Crystallospora cristalloides Epieimeria: The species in this genus are tetrasporocystic, dizoic, possess Stieda bodies, and undergo merogony and gametogony on the lumenal surface of the intestinal tract. Three species are in this genus. Species identification Giemsa stained Eimeria stidae, 10x magnification Methods for species identification are varied and among others, include isozyme analysis, the use of rRNA and rDNA probes, DNA assays and recombinant DNA techniques. PCR has proven most useful for outbreak surveillance. Prior to these methods, species identification was based on phenotypic characteristics such as the site of parasite development, the oocyst structure, the host species, cross immunity and the presence of lesions. Out of these, comparing oocyst structures was the most commonly used method. Genomics A whole genome sequencing project is in progress with chosen species, Eimeria tenella. The genome is about 60 megabases in size and has a GC-content around 53%. The 14 chromosomes range in size from 1 to > 6 megabases. Since 2013, the sequencing and annotation of a further six avian Eimeria species genomes is in progress. Pathology and symptoms Coccidiosis typically results in diarrhoea, weight loss and dehydration. A combination of these factors may result in poor growth and death of the animal, particularly amongst young. Other clinical signs include lethargy, depression, and reduced normal grooming behaviour. Diarrhoea may be bloody due to intestinal epithelium dying off when a large number of oocysts and merozoites burst out of the cells. The severity of the disease is directly dependent on the number of infective Eimeria oocysts that are ingested. The pathogenesis of infection varies from mild to severe, and is largely dependent on the magnitude of infection. In light infections, the damage to the gut might only be minimal and be rapidly repaired as cells are rapidly replaced by the body. However, in heavy infections, it may only take two weeks for many intestinal epithelial cells to be infected with either Eimeria meronts or gametocytes. These cause the epithelial cells to burst, which causes significant damage to the intestine epithelial layer, resulting in the release of blood, fluid, and electrolytes into the intestine. Prevention and treatment Good animal husbandry practices and prophylactic application of anticoccidial drugs that target different stages of the parasite lifecycle, such as sulfonamides, ionophores and toltrazuril, are the preferred methods of disease prevention, particularly in the poultry industry. The following drugs can be used for treatment of coccidiosis in cattle: amprolium, sulfaquinoxaline, and sulfamethazine. However, it is often more effective to prevent this disease in cattle, which can be aided by the products lasalocid, decoquinate, and monensin. There is a growing problem of drug resistance, as well as possible drug residues in the meat once the animal is butchered. As a result, other avenues of control are being explored, particularly vaccine development, although several live attenuated vaccines have been in use since the 1950s. So far, the best practice is to vaccinate the chicks once they hatch from the egg so they are immune for life. Infection with Eimeria results in life-long immunity to that particular parasite species, but does not give cross protection against other species. For these reasons, vaccines for control seem promising, of which live attenuated vaccines are most effective. However, the search for highly immunogenic antigens and overcoming antigenic variation of the parasites remains a challenge. Immunity to the parasite varies depending on parasite and host species, as well as the site of invasion. CD4+ T cells and interferon gamma (Œ≥) are crucial components of natural immunity to infection. Humoral immunity is thought to play little role in protection, and is most likely mediated through secretory IgA antibodies.

It was discovered by American astronomer Eleanor Helin on 30 September 1982, at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California, and named for the city of San Diego.  Classification and orbit  The bright E-type asteroid is a member of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.7‚Äì2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 22¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The first observation was taken at Crimea‚ÄìNauchnij in 1974, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 8 years prior to its discovery.  Slow rotator  San Diego is a slow rotator. In March 2005, a rotational lightcurve was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Brian Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory () in Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (). The period was derived from a re-examined lightcurve that originally gave a much shorter period of hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination.  Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, San Diego measures 4.8 and 5.0 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.25 and 0.28, respectively, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.30 ‚Äì a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.2, corresponding to the Hungaria asteroids both as family and orbital group ‚Äì and calculates a diameter of 4.6 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 13.7.  Naming  This minor planet was named for the city of San Diego, California, in appreciation of the city council's efforts to reduce the local light pollution . Palomar mountain is located within San Diego County, California, and the astronomers at the site were concerned that the light pollution from the city would ruin their ability to use the observatory. The council had voted to use Low-Pressure Sodium (LPS) vapor lamps for their street lights. This fixture only emitted light at one wavelength, which astronomers could readily filter out. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 13 July 1984 ().  References  Further reading * Curtis Peebles, Asteroids: A History, 2000, Smithsonian Institution, .

They were named after the 10th Governor of Hong Kong, Sir William Des V≈ìux. The name was sometimes spelt with the ligature ≈ì in pre-war documents but is nowadays spelt officially as Des Voeux Road. History Beginning in 1857, the northern shore of Hong Kong Island (also known as Victoria City) underwent a series of reclamations under then- Governor Sir John Bowring. The first phase of the Praya Reclamation Scheme had a direct effect on this current street, which used to be known as Praya Central during the Colonial Hong Kong era. Bowring's plans were opposed by British merchants who held lands in the Central area, and in response, the government instead commenced work in land reclamation in the Chinese-populated Western District. By the time the reclamation was extended to Central, the newly reclaimed land in Western had already been settled, and there was a discontinuity between the two roads running along the western and middle portions of the reclaimed shoreline. Upon completion, the roads were named Bowring Praya West and Bowring Praya Central respectively. Another series of extensive reclamation projects began in 1887 under then-Governor Des Voeux. Upon completion in 1904, Bowring Praya West and Bowring Praya Central (which by then were situated inland from the shoreline) were respectively renamed Des Voeux Road West and Des Voeux Road Central per the orders of then-Colonial Secretary and acting Governor Francis Fleming during the Duke of Connaught's visit to Hong Kong in 1890. From 1942 to 1945, the road was renamed Sh≈çwa-dori by the Japanese occupation government. Des Voeux Road Central Section of Des Voeux Road Central, between the HSBC Main Building and Statue Square, looking toward Prince's Building. Des Voeux Road Central runs from Western to Central. It begins at the intersection with On Tai Street in Western and merges with Queen's Road Central where it becomes Queensway (and, later, Hennessy Road). Landmarks along Des Voeux Road Central include: * Bank of China Building(#2A), which houses the China Club * HSBC Building (Hong Kong) * 9 Queen's Road Central * Statue Square * Prince's Building * Alexandra House * Standard Chartered Bank Building * The Landmark * World-wide House * Central Market * Hang Seng Bank Headquarters Building (#83) * Man Yee Building * Wing On House (#71) * Western Market (#323) Des Voeux Road West Des Voeux Road West runs from Western Shek Tong Tsui. It reaches an alignment several blocks down at the junction with Connaught Road West and becomes Kennedy Town Praya in Shek Tong Tsui. Proposal to pedestrianise Des Voeux Road Central Very DVRC campaign on 25 September 2016, a temporary street closure held to raise public awareness of walkability and open space issues Various groups have long proposed pedestrianising a section of Des Voeux Road Central. The idea was first proposed in 2000 by the Hong Kong Institute of Planners (HKIP) as a transport improvement scheme. The scheme was deemed technically feasible but was not implemented by the government at that time. A further study was done in 2014 in collaboration with the MTR and MVA, the leading traffic engineering firm in Hong Kong, to explore how the environment can be enhanced with the transport improvement scheme. The plan involves converting a 1.4 km section of Des Voeux Road Central, between Pedder Street and the Western Market, from a thoroughfare for motorised traffic to a pedestrian zone. The tramway would be maintained in situ and the cross-streets would remain open to traffic. Bus routes would be diverted onto Connaught Road. The pedestrian zone would remain open to delivery vehicles and emergency services. With huge support from different stakeholder groups, the Very DVRC Event was launched on 25 September 2016 to raise people's awareness of walkability and open space issues in Hong Kong. The successful one-day trial demonstrated that the closure of DVRC to most traffic can, indeed, be successfully accomplished without adverse impact on traffic and businesses. In January 2017, Walk DVRC Ltd, an NGO, was set up to take this initiative forward. Public transportation Des Voeux Road Central is shared between motor traffic and the tram line, with tracks and reserved lanes for the trams laid in the middle of the road. A bus lane runs along the road for most of its length. Part of the MTR Island Line also runs underneath Des Voeux Road. Due to the discontinuity between Des Voeux Roads Central and West, the tram line takes a detour along Connaught Road West and then continues along Des Voeux Road West towards Kennedy Town. The Central- Mid-Levels escalators link Des Voeux Road Central with Conduit Road in the Mid-levels, passing through narrow streets.

The word, Nishan Sahib means exalted ensign, and the flag is hoisted on a tall flagpole, outside most Gurdwaras. The flagpole itself, covered with fabric, ends with a two-edged dagger (khanda) on top. The emblem on the flag is also known as Khanda, which depicts a double-edged sword called a khanda (‚ò¨) in the centre, a chakkar which is circular, and flanked by two single-edged swords, or kirpans.In the centre of the insignia is the two- edged sword which symbolises the Creative Power of God that controls the destiny of the whole universe. It is the Sovereign Power over life and death. One edge of the Sword symbolises divine justice, which chastises and punishes the wicked oppressors; the other edge symbolises Freedom, and Authority governed by moral and spiritual values. On the outside of the two-edged sword, we can see two swords: * On the left is the Sword of Spiritual Sovereignty (Piri); * On the right is the Sword of Political Sovereignty (Miri) There must always be a balance between the two, and this balance is emphasised by a circle inside. This circle is what is called a Chakra or Chakkar. The Chakra is a symbol of all embracing Divine Manifestation, including everything and wanting nothing, without beginning or end, neither first nor last, timeless, and Absolute. It is the symbol of oneness, of Unicity of Justice, Humanity, and the Immortality. Almost all Sikh warriors used to wear it in the eighteenth century, and Nihangs of today still do. The Khanda Sahib is not to be confused with the Nihang's Aad Chand which was the first symbol of the Khalsa. Traditional symbol of the Khalsa Panth (corps of initiated Sikhs), the Nishan Sahib can be seen from far away, signifying the presence of Khalsa in the neighbourhood. It is taken down every Baisakhi (harvest festival, mid- April in the Gregorian calendar and first in The Nanakshahi Calander), and replaced with a fresh flag, and the flagpole refurbished. History Basanti Nishan Sahib, as introduced by Guru Hargobind. Sikh Nihang Flag, introduced by Guru Gobind Singh Flag used during the times of Sikh misls and the Sikh Empire Flag of Dal Khalsa (Sikh Army), showing weapons like Katar (dagger), Dhal Shield and Kirpan, traditional Sikh weapons. The standard goes from 'bottom to top' signifying that the armies of the tenth guru are always victorious. It is also worthy to note the sword, shield and punch dagger. The sword represents that the army shall decapitate the enemy, protect the needy with the shield and pierce the enemies chest with the punch dagger. Guru Gobind Singh with followers carrying Basanti flag with emblems. During the times of Guru Amar Das the Nishan Sahib was white, to represent peace and simplicity. During the time of Guru Hargobind, however the Nishan Sahib changed into a shade of yellow, known as Basanti. After the creation of Khalsa, Guru Gobind Singh introduced blue flag, which is still the colour of the Nihang flags. The first Sikh flags were plain, but emblems were introduced by Guru Gobind Singh. The first Sikh emblem, was not the Khanda, but the three weapons, the Kattar (dagger), Dhal (shield) and Kirpan (sabre). Later these emblems were also used by the Sikh misls and the Empire. When Gulab Singh asked Maharaja Ranjit Singh to change the Nishan Sahib to saffron or deep orange Maharaja Ranjit Singh declined but later when he changed the army from traditional akalis to French- style soldiers he made separate flags to respect Hindu and Muslim ideologies. Sikh Empire Nishan Sahib flag, introduced by Ranjit Singh Overview The Nishan Sahib is placed outside most Sikh Gurdwaras and is supported by a pole of timber or metal. The Khanda, a Sikh symbol, today, is rendered in navy blue on the saffron background while the original was basanti( bright yellow) and surrmai neela ( Royal blue). The khanda is placed high up on a flagpole as a sign for all Sikhs and indeed any other people that they can come and pray in this building. Great respect is shown to this flag and the flag is considered sacred and washed using milk and water every year in April at the festival of Vaisakhi. The Nishan Sahib is changed once the saffron color has faded.

A manufactured form is used to treat kidney disease with low blood calcium, hyperparathyroidism due to kidney disease, low blood calcium due to hypoparathyroidism, osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and familial hypophosphatemia. It is taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. Excessive amount commonly results in weakness, headache, nausea, constipation, urinary tract infections, and abdominal pain. Serious side effects may include high blood calcium and anaphylaxis. Regular blood tests are recommended after the medication is started and when the dose is changed. Calcitriol increases blood calcium (Ca2+) mainly by increasing the uptake of calcium from the intestines. Calcitriol was approved for medical use in the United States in 1978. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 256th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions. Medical use Calcitriol is prescribed for: *Treatment of hypocalcaemia ‚Äì hypoparathyroidism, osteomalacia (adults), rickets (infants, children), renal osteodystrophy, chronic kidney disease *Treatment of osteoporosis *Prevention of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis Calcitriol has been used in an ointment for the treatment of psoriasis, although the vitamin D analogue calcipotriol (calcipotriene) is more commonly used. Calcitriol has also been given by mouth for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Research on the noncalcemic actions of calcitriol and other VDR- ligand analogs and their possible therapeutic applications has been reviewed.. Adverse effects The main adverse drug reaction associated with calcitriol therapy is hypercalcemia ‚Äì early symptoms include: nausea, vomiting, constipation, anorexia, apathy, headache, thirst, pruritus, sweating, and/or polyuria. Compared to other vitamin D compounds in clinical use (cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol), calcitriol has a higher risk of inducing hypercalcemia. However, such episodes may be shorter and easier to treat due to its relatively short half-life. However, high calcitriol levels may also be seen in human disease states in patients not on supplementation. In the patient with hypercalcaemia and high calcitriol levels, one would expect to find a low intact parathyroid hormone level. The major diagnosis for hypercalcaemia with elevated calcitriol levels are: 1\\\\. Lymphoma 2\\\\. Tuberculosis 3\\\\. Sarcoidosis However the differential diagnosis list is extensive and also includes: * Fungal infections; Pneumocystis jiroveci, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, candidiasis * Other granulomatous conditions; PR3+ vasculitis, Crohn's disease, acute granulomatous pneumonia, talc granuloma, silicone-induced granuloma, BCG- associated, granulomatous hepatitis, paraffin-associated granuloma * Genetic conditions; Williams syndrome, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, CYP24A1 mutation (adult / infantile), SLC34A1 mutation * Miscellaneous; mycobacterium avium, leprosy, lipoid pneumonia, cat scratch fever, berylliosis  Mechanism of action  Calcitriol increases blood calcium levels ([]) by: * Promoting absorption of dietary calcium from the gastrointestinal tract. * Increasing renal tubular reabsorption of calcium, thus reducing the loss of calcium in the urine. * Stimulating release of calcium from bone. For this it acts on the specific type of bone cells referred to as osteoblasts, causing them to release RANKL, which in turn activates osteoclasts. Calcitriol acts in concert with parathyroid hormone (PTH) in all three of these roles. For instance, PTH also indirectly stimulates osteoclasts. However, the main effect of PTH is to increase the rate at which the kidneys excrete inorganic phosphate (Pi), the counterion of . The resulting decrease in serum phosphate causes hydroxyapatite (Ca5(PO4)3OH) to dissolve out of bone, thus increasing serum calcium. PTH also stimulates the production of calcitriol (see below). Many of the effects of calcitriol are mediated by its interaction with the calcitriol receptor, also called the vitamin D receptor or VDR. For instance, the unbound inactive form of the calcitriol receptor in intestinal epithelial cells resides in the cytoplasm. When calcitriol binds to the receptor, the ligand- receptor complex translocates to the cell nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor promoting the expression of a gene encoding a calcium binding protein. The levels of the calcium binding protein increase enabling the cells to actively transport more calcium () from the intestine across the intestinal mucosa into the blood. The maintenance of electroneutrality requires that the transport of ions catalyzed by the intestinal epithelial cells be accompanied by counterions, primarily inorganic phosphate. Thus calcitriol also stimulates the intestinal absorption of phosphate. The observation that calcitriol stimulates the release of calcium from bone seems contradictory, given that sufficient levels of serum calcitriol generally prevent overall loss of calcium from bone. It is believed that the increased levels of serum calcium resulting from calcitriol-stimulated intestinal uptake causes bone to take up more calcium than it loses by hormonal stimulation of osteoclasts. Only when there are conditions, such as dietary calcium deficiency or defects in intestinal transport, which result in a reduction of serum calcium does an overall loss of calcium from bone occur. Calcitriol also inhibits the release of calcitonin, a hormone which reduces blood calcium primarily by inhibiting calcium release from bone.  Biosynthesis and its regulation  Calcitriol synthesis Calcitriol is produced in the cells of the proximal tubule of the nephron in the kidneys by the action of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-hydroxylase, a mitochondrial oxygenase and an enzyme which catalyzes the hydroxylation of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (calcifediol) in the 1-alpha position. The activity of this enzyme is stimulated by PTH. This is an important control point in Ca2+ homeostasis. Additional effects on the production of calcitriol include an increase by prolactin, a hormone which stimulates lactogenesis (the formation of milk in mammary glands), a process which requires large amounts of calcium. Activity is also decreased by high levels of serum phosphate and by an increase in the production of the hormone FGF23 by osteocyte cells in bone. Calcitriol is also produced outside the kidney in small amounts by many other tissues including placenta and activated macrophages. When the drug alfacalcidol is used, 25-hydroxylation in the liver will produce calcitriol as the active metabolite. This will produce greater effects than other vitamin D precursors in patients with kidney disease who have loss of the renal 1-alpha- hydroxylase. =Interactive pathway map= =Metabolism= Calcitriol's lifespan in the body is measured in hours, unlike its precursor calcifediol whose lifespan is measured in weeks. Calcitriol is inactivated by further hydroxylation to form 1,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D, calcitroic acid. This occurs through the action of the CYP24A1 24-hydroxylase. Calcitroic acid is more soluble in water and is excreted in bile and urine. History It was first identified in 1971 by Michael F. Holick working in the laboratory of Hector DeLuca, and also by Tony Norman and colleagues.  Names  Calcitriol usually refers specifically to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. Because cholecalciferol already has one hydroxyl group, only two (1,25) are further specified in this nomenclature, but there are three (1,3,25-triol), as indicated in when calcitriol is used. The 1-hydroxy group is in the alpha position, and this may be specified in the name, for instance in the abbreviation 1Œ±,25-(OH)2D3. Calcitriol is, strictly, the 1-hydroxylation product of calcifediol (25-OH vitamin D3), derived from cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), rather than the product of hydroxylations of ergocalciferol (vitamin D2). 1Œ±,25-Dihydroxyergocalciferol (ercalcitriol) should be used for the vitamin D2 product. However, the terminology of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, or 1,25(OH)2D, is often used to refer to both types of active forms of vitamin D. Indeed, both bind to the vitamin D receptor and produce biological effects. In clinical use, the differences are unlikely to have major importance. Calcitriol is marketed as a pharmaceutical for medical use under various trade names including Rocaltrol (Roche), Calcijex (Abbott), Decostriol (Mibe, Jesalis), Vectical (Galderma), and Rolsical (Sun Pharma).

The person feels a full and tight abdomen.Abdominal bloating, National Institutes of Health, Retrieved November 7, 2013 Although this term is usually used interchangeably with abdominal distension, these symptoms probably have different pathophysiological processes, which are not fully understood. The first step for the management is to find a treatment for the underlying causes that produce it through a detailed medical history and a physical examination. The discomfort can be alleviated by the use of certain drugs and dietary modifications. Symptoms The most common symptoms associated with bloating is a sensation that the abdomen is full or distended. Rarely, bloating may be painful or cause shortness of breath. Pains that are due to bloating will feel sharp and cause the stomach to cramp. These pains may occur anywhere in the body and can change locations quickly.Gas and Gas Pains Mayo Clinic. Retrieved on 2010-01-26 They are so painful that they are sometimes mistaken for heart pains when they develop on the upper left side of the chest. Pains on the right side are often confused with problems in the appendix or the gallbladder. One symptom of gas that is not normally associated with it is the hiccup. Hiccups are harmless and will diminish on their own; they also help to release gas that is in the digestive tract before it moves down to the intestines and causes bloating. Important but uncommon causes of abdominal bloating include ascites and tumors.Abdominal Bloating MedLine Plus. Retrieved on 2010-01-26 Causes There are many causes of bloating, including: diet, irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, reflux, and constipation. Specific medical conditions like Crohn's disease or bowel obstruction can also contribute to the amount of stomach bloating experienced. Common causes of abdominal bloating are: * Overeating * Gastric distension * Lactose intolerance, fructose intolerance and other food intolerances * Premenstrual Syndrome * Food allergy * Aerophagia (air swallowing, a nervous habit) * Irritable bowel syndrome * Celiac disease * Non-celiac gluten sensitivity * Partial bowel obstruction * Gastric dumping syndrome or rapid gastric emptying * Gas-producing foods * Constipation * Visceral fat * Splenic-flexure syndrome * Menstruation, dysmenorrhea * Polycystic ovary syndrome and ovarian cysts * Alvarez' syndrome, bloating of unknown or psychogenic origin without excess of gas in the digestive tract * Massive infestation with intestinal parasites (e.g., Ascaris lumbricoides) * Diverticulosis * Certain medications, such as phentermine * Occurs in some due to salivary hypersecretion and dehydration. * Ovarian cancer Important but uncommon causes of abdominal bloating include: * Large intra-abdominal tumors, such as those arising from cancers of the ovarian, liver, uterus and stomach * Megacolon, an abnormal dilation of the colon caused by some diseases, such as Chagas disease, a parasitic infection * Cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedures, due to the artificial mouth-to-mouth insufflation of air.

Retrieved on 2018-02-05 * Ruminal tympany, a condition of ruminant animals which occurs when gas cannot escape from the rumen. = Fiber = Most cases of stomach bloating are due to improper diet. Gas occurs because of the bacteria in the colon and is a by-product of soluble fiber digestion. Inadequate or irregular intake of fiber and water will cause a person to experience bloating or constipation. The most common natural sources of fiber include fruits and vegetables as well as wheat or oat bran. These fibers are most likely to cause flatulence.Fiber And Increased Gas MedicineNet. Retrieved on 2010-01-19 Fiber is made by plants and is not easily digested by the human gastrointestinal tract. There are two main types of dietary fiber: soluble and insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber is prebiotic and readily fermented in the colon into gases, while insoluble fiber is metabolically inert and absorbs water as it moves through the digestive system, aiding in defecation. Most types of fiber (insoluble) are attached to body water in the intestine and increase the volume of stools. = Bowel gas = Gas in the gastrointestinal tract has only two sources. It is either swallowed air or is produced by bacteria that normally inhabit the intestines, primarily the colon.What Causes Flatulence MedicineNet. Retrieved on 2010-01-19 Belching or burping is a universal ability that works by removing gas from the stomach through the mouth. The stomach can become bloated when too much air is swallowed during eating and drinking too quickly. As the stomach swells, belching removes the gas and alleviates the pain associated with it. Burping can also be used as a form of relief from abdominal discomfort other than too much gas in the stomach. Flatulence or farting provides relief of much the same kind as burping, but involves the passage of gas from the body via the anus, not the mouth. Bacteria present in the intestinal tract cause gas to be expelled from the anus. They produce the gas as food is digested and moved from the small intestine. This gas builds up and causes swelling or bloating in the abdominal area before it is released. = Constipation = A common gastrointestinal problem is constipation‚Äîinfrequent bowel movements, hard stools, or strain during the movements‚Äîwhich causes serious cases of bloating. Since most cases of constipation are temporary, simple lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise and increasing one's intake of fiber, can go a long way toward alleviating constipation.Constipation Definition Mayo Clinic Retrieved on 2010-01-19 Some cases of constipation will continue to worsen and require unconventional methods to release the feces and reduce the amount of stomach bloating. Blood in the stool, intense pain in the abdomen, rectal pain, and unexplained weight loss should be reported to a doctor. Bloating consistently accompanies constipation, and they will not develop without an underlying cause. = Heartburn and acid reflux = Painful burning sensations in the chest that is caused by gastroesophageal reflux is known as heartburn. Reflux is the back flow of gastric acid juices from the stomach into the oesophagus. Heartburn has different triggers, including certain foods, medications, obesity, and stress. These triggers are different for each individual. Gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD is a chronic condition that can lead to more serious complications like esophageal cancer. Treatment options are available to treat the symptoms and the condition, but there is no cure for the disease. Symptoms include burping, abdominal and stomach bloating, along with pain and discomfort. Heavy meals, lying down or bending over after eating should be avoided to help prevent reflux from occurring. The stomach bloating experienced with reflux is intense and will remain until the food is digested all the way. Postmortem bloating occurs in cadavers, due to the formation of gases by bacterial action and putrefaction of the internal tissues of the abdomen and the inside of the intestines. =Related conditions= Conditions that are related to bloating include constipation, lactose intolerance, and acid reflux disease. All of these conditions share the same symptoms and can share the same causative agents. These causes include unhealthy diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, low amount of exercise, and overall health. Each of these conditions can be experienced as a symptom of the others and is also a cause for each of them. In most cases where one of the conditions is present, there is at least one if not two of the others. Treatment for each condition is performed using the same medications and recommended dietary changes like increased fiber intake and reduced fat intake. If the conditions develop into disease such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or chronic constipation, additional medications will be required. Bloating and flatulence are sometimes related to constipation, and treating the underlying condition may be helpful.Belching Bloating and Flatulence American College of Gastroenterology. Retrieved on 2010-01-26 Treatment There are many over-the-counter (OTC) medications that can be used to treat bloating. Food enzymes can be found in some products that will help break down the sugars found in grains, vegetables and dairy products. They can be taken before food is consumed or added to the food that causes the gas and bloating. The most common treatment is antacids. These medications have no effect on the gas that is presently in the intestines, but enable gas build-up to be belched away more easily, reducing the amount of bloating that develops. Another treatment is Simethicone, an oral anti-foaming agent that helps the body to expel the gas more quickly. Also combinations of prokinetics, such as domperidone + metoclopramide + diphenhydramine (the latter for the prevention of extrapyramidal reactions, especially acute dystonic reactions) + proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), have dramatic effects on bloaters and belchers especially.

Despite the name, the game play doesn't seem to be related to the word tournament. Rules First, the cards are shuffled and dealt as two columns of four cards laid out as a reserve (or \\"the kibitzers\\"). The player must make sure that these eight cards include either a king, an ace, or both; otherwise you reshuffle and redeal. When at least a king or an ace are present, six columns of four cards are then dealt as a tableau (or \\"the dormitzers\\"). At least a king or an ace must be present among the first eight cards for the game to work. The initial layout in the game of Tournament. The object of the game is to free one king and one ace of each suit and built them by suit. The kings should be built down while the aces should be built up. The game is won when all cards are dealt onto the foundations. The top cards of each column on the tableau and all eight cards on the reserve are available. The cards on the reserve are available to be built on the foundations, and any space it leaves behind are optionally filled from any from the tableau. No building is allowed on the tableau. Spaces in the tableau are immediately filled by a new set of four cards. The top cards of foundations are available to be built on each other. When the player has made all the moves one could make, four cards from the stock are deal onto each column, and play continues. When no further play is possible, the player then collects all the cards on the tableau by first gathering the rightmost column and placing it on the pile to its left, and then placing this new pile to the pile on its left and so on. Then, without shuffling, six new columns of four cards each are dealt, and play continues. Two such redeals are allowed. Variants Tournament was created by Albert Morehead and Geoffrey Mott-Smith, by combining elements from the older game La Nivernaise (also just Nivernaise) with the game Marechal Saxe. Nivernaise is played exactly as Tournament except the six columns of four cards each are just piles with only their top cards exposed. Here, the reserve is the \\"flank\\" while the piles are the \\"line.\\" Cicely is another variant of Tournament, which has 8 rather than 6 piles in the tableau. There are no redeals, but building is allowed, making the game much easier to win. Kingsdown Eights is a variation of Tournament and Cicely.

Offenbourg) is a city located in the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. With about 57,000 inhabitants (2013), it is the largest city and the administrative capital of the Ortenaukreis.  History  In recent times the remains of Roman settlements have been found within the city's territory. Offenburg was first mentioned in historical documents dating back to 1148. Offenburg had already been declared a Free Imperial City by 1240. In September 1689 the city - with the exception of two buildings - was totally destroyed by the French during the Nine Years War. Due to Napoleon's dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1803 and subsequent reorganization of the German states, Offenburg lost its status as a Free Imperial City and fell under the rule of the Grand Duchy of Baden. During the outbreak of the Revolutions of 1848, the \\"Offenburger Programm\\" which consisted of thirteen demands \\"in the name of the people of Baden\\", was put forward at the Salmen Inn on 12 September 1847. This was the first known demand for democracy in Germany. Along with the Carlsbad Decrees, the Offenburger Program demanded basic and human rights as well as freedom of the press and a progressive income tax structure. On 19 March 1848 the demands were confirmed by the 20,000 member Offenburg Peoples' Assembly. During World War I Offenburg was one of the first cities to experience the effects of aerial bombardment, the operations against Offenburg railway sidings were mostly flown by aircraft from the Independent Force from Ochey aerodrome. It is mostly neglected, that in the aftermath of World War I, during the Occupation of the Ruhr, French troops occupied Offenburg, because it fell within the perimeter of the Kehl bridgehead. The French occupation forces entered the town in February 1923 and remained until 1924, blocking all traffic on the Rhine Valley Railway between Offenburg and Appenweier. Following the rise to power of the NSDAP in the 1930s, Offenburg's Jewish population fell victim to acts of repression, that culminated in the vandalization of the local synagoge in November 1938. After the war had begun, those members of the Jewish population that had not managed to emigrate were deported to Gurs concentration camp in October 1940 and from there to Auschwitz during 1942. In World War II, owing to its geographical proximity to the French border, Offenburg was either exposed to temporary evacuations during the Battle of France in 1940 or artillery fire towards the final stages of the conflict. It was only a primary target on one occasion during World War II on 27 November 1944, when a force of more than 300 USAAF B-17 and Liberator bombers attacked the marshalling yards. Many other tactical attacks were flown during 1944 and 1945 against the railway installations.Peter Nath: Luftkriegsoperationen gegen die Stadt Offenburg im Ersten und Zweiten Weltkrieg, in: Die Ortenau (1990), S. 574-659. French Forces entered Offenburg on 15 April 1945 and from then on Offenburg became part of the French Zone of Occupation until the creation of the Federal Republic of Germany in May 1949. Since the creation of the Federal Republic, Offenburg has continually developed in size, inhabitants and prosperity. Between 1971 and 1975 eleven adjacent villages were incorporated into the commune of Offenburg and are now an integral part of the city.

Since October 24, 2017, he has held the office as 13th President of the Bundestag.  Geography  Offenburg is located approximately 15 km east of the river Rhine between Karlsruhe and Freiburg. The French city of Strasbourg lies 20 km northwest across the Rhine. Offenburg is situated at the mouth of the Kinzig river valley and at the foot of the Black Forest. The Kinzig flows out of the Black Forest and meets the Rhine near Kehl. = Climate = K√∂ppen climate classification classifies its climate as oceanic climate (Cfb). Marine features are limited however, as a result of its vast distance from oceans and seas. As a result, summers have a significant subtropical influence as the inland air heats up. Winters are moderate but usually with frequent frosts. The climate in this area is close to a Mediterranean climate with less precipitation in autumn and winter months, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. Offenburg is close to a humid subtropical (Cfa) climate due to the mean temperatures in summer just under 22 ¬∞C. Additionally, Offenburg is one of the warmest places in Germany and therefore considered as a viticultural area like neighbor villages such as Durbach, Oberkirch or Gengenbach.  Economy  Offenburg has a rich trade and manufacturing sector and is home to a number of well-known brands. = Manufacturing and industry = Important manufacturing companies based at Offenburg include tesa-Werke Offenburg GmbH (adhesive tapes), Vivil (humbugs and sweets), MEIKO Maschinenbau GmbH & Co. KG (professional dishwashing systems, cleaning and desinfection technology), Hansgrohe SE (sanitary fittings) and HOBART GmbH (professional kitchen equipment). Besides, there are many other small and medium-sized companies that produce highly specialized top-of-the-line products in their appropriate sector of business. = Trade and commerce = The most important trading company in terms of employees (1,850) is EDEKA Handelsgesellschaft S√ºdwest mbH, the largest German supermarket corporation which has a large regional production, storage and distribution centre in Offenburg. Printus GmbH with approx. 1,600 employees is a stationary wholesaling company. Several subsidiaries or affiliated companies of Markant AG (food and nonfood trade) are based in Offenburg with approx. 600 staff. = Publishing and printing = Hubert Burda Media is one of Germany's largest publishing companies. Together with the affiliated Burda printing works it still employs 1,600 people in Offenburg. Although the prominent position with regard to the number of employees has diminished during the last decades with the emerging of further economic actors in town, the expansion of Franz Burda's printing business after World War II as well as the growth and success of his wife Aenne Burda's Burda Style (formerly: Burda Moden) have been decisive in developing the local economy after 1945 and in making the name of the city known all over the world.  Infrastructure  = Traffic = Owing to its favourable geographic situation Offenburg has been lying at the crossroads of important lines of communication that can be traced back to Roman times.  Road  Offenburg is situated 3 km east of the federal motorway A 5, to which it has been connected since 1960 via a famous egg- shaped junction. Two major federal roads, B 3 and B 33, intersect at Offenburg.  Rail  Since the construction of the railway line from Mannheim in 1844, Offenburg had developed into a railway centre during the 19th and earlier part of the 20th century. However, since the privatization of the Deutsche Bundesbahn in the early 1990s and the ensuing restructuring of the Deutsche Bahn AG, which subsequently led to the decommissioning of the railway workshops, the operations in Offenburg have considerably shrunk in size. Today Offenburg station lies at the crossroads of a number of railway lines, the most important being the Rhine Valley Railway, the main line between Karlsruhe and Basel with regular Intercity Express (ICE) services to Basel, Berlin, Cologne, Frankfurt, Frankfurt Airport and Amsterdam. The picturesque Black Forest Railway starts at Offenburg as does the line to Strasbourg and the line serving the Rench valley in the Black Forest. Due to the re-routing of the TGV services from Freiburg to Paris-Est via Offenburg (instead of via M√ºllheim and Mulhouse) in December 2018, there has since been a daily (except Saturdays) direct service from Offenburg via Strasbourg to Paris-Est.  Air  Offenburg airfield (EDTO) has been used for flying purposes since 1911 and has received a paved runway in 1975. It is owned by the municipality. However, since its declassification as a publicly accessible airfield in the 1990s, the 910 metre asphalt runway (02-20) is only available to resident aeroclubs and to aircraft that have obtained prior permission from the operator. Airports in the vicinity are: Flughafen Lahr in Lahr (EDTL) and, with scheduled traffic, Strasbourg-Entzheim (LFST) and Baden-S√∂llingen (EDSB). Both, Lahr and Baden-S√∂llingen had formerly been used by the Canadian Forces in Europe and became available for civil use after the end of the Cold War. The combination of an abundance of three well-equipped airports close by, the ever-growing noise sensitivity of residents as well as the necessity for commercial development areas has in 2012 revived discussions to shut down the aerodrome completely.  Education  Apart from the primary and secondary schools that are within the responsibility of several public bodies, Offenburg houses a diverse number of educational institutions. Offenburg is also home to the University of Applied Sciences Offenburg, with its main campus location in Offenburg, and the other campus in Gengenbach (less than 12 km away).  Cultural heritage  There are several historical attractions in Offenburg including: * The Salmen Inn * The Capuchin Monastery * The Ritterhaus, a 1784 manor-house that has been converted into the city archives and museum * The Jewish Bath (Mikveh): a bathhouse belonging to the city's historical Jewish community; it was held to be medieval, but recent research suggests it may be from the 16th or 17th century * The former Royal Palace (K√∂nigshof) built by Michael Ludwig Rohrer, now housing the Police station  Sports  Offenburger FV is a German association football club based in the city of Offenburg, Baden-W√ºrttemberg. The club is one of the most successful amateur football clubs in Germany.

The band was originally formed by Owl and Levannah as a duo called Ocean Road. On 11 March 2013, it was announced that Qkumba Zoo was officially a side project, and Owl joined with Simone to create Owl and Simone. The band's 1996 song \\"The Child (Inside)\\" was a hit in the United States, reaching number 69 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart BIG Qkumba Zoo's first release was titled BIG, and it was released in South Africa on Gresham Records. At the time, the band's name was spelled 'Qcumba Zoo', and even Tziki's name was the elongated 'Tsatsiki'. The booklet contained a colourful, busy design, featuring original artwork from Tziki, and pictures from Qcumba's stage shows. The title track on BIG has slightly different music and vocals from its subsequent release on Wake Up & Dream, and \\"The Child (Inside)\\" has a fading outro. Track listing 1\\\\. Rain (3:58) 2\\\\.

As Levannah said, \\"We wanted to form something that could be part of the global village. And, at the same time, have it be tied to its birthplace.\\" This is apparent with Owl's fusion of tribal & synth, backed by Levannah's trilling vocals. Track listing 1\\\\. Rain (3:45) 2\\\\.

It peaked on the Radio & Records contemporary hit radio charts at No. 34 on October 16, 1996. The 1996 Arista release of \\"The Child (Inside)\\" featured several mixes by DJ Junior Vasquez that became the standard for the song in American clubs. Vasquez followed up with several mixes of \\"Cloud Eyes (I'm Scared You're Scared)\\". In recent years, the original mix of \\"The Child (Inside)\\" has been used in several US television commercials, the most popular being from Seaworld parks and Carnival Cruise Lines. The track \\"Weeping\\" was added to this release, the a cover of an anti-apartheid song by Bright Blue, another South African band. Bonus tracks are also provided on this album, including a musical remix of \\"Mermaids\\" and two stories/poems narrated by Levannah. In August 1996, the group were the opening act for Danish singer Whigfield when she performed at the University of Port Elizabeth indoor sports centre. Retrieved 23 May 2014 Butterfly Peepl Several years after the release of the debut album, band member Tziki committed suicide. This was one of the catalysts that changed Owl and Levannah, which can be heard in the music of their second album, Butterfly Peepl, released in 2000. In addition to the album's release, the band's name was officially shortened from Qkumba Zoo to QZoo. The group also left Arista Records in favour of their own independent label, Zoocumba Music. The Butterfly Peepl release did not gain much attention, only having been for sale for a short time on QZoo's official site. Track listing 1\\\\. Beautiful (4:28) 2\\\\.

The band still consisted of Owl and Levannah, who were now paired with a woman named Cajun. Lyrics for a new song, \\"Strike Out Against the Tide\\", appeared on the main page for a brief while, but soon the site disappeared. Eventually, Owl resurfaced online and made it clear that he had not stopped making music, whether solo or paired with Levannah's voice. Tracks like \\"Vision Afrika 2000\\", \\"These Visions\\", \\"Spider Girl\\", and \\"My Shepherd\\" appeared for fans to stream/download. In 2009, Qkumba Zoo released a new EP called N3X+, available for download on Rhythm Music Store's website. =Track listing= #Earthbound #Torn Between You and the Sky #Strike Out Against the Tide #Karmic Book #Let the Light in Tracks 2 and 5, while previously released on Butterfly Peepl, were remastered for N3X+. \\"Earthbound\\" was a song originally written while the band was still known as Ocean Road. Between Owl's solo work and N3X+, there is an apparent musical change from previous albums, which is now heading in the direction of traditional folk while continuing to integrate electronic/tribal sounds. In late 2009, another official Qkumba Zoo site opened at Qkumbazoo.co.za, which contains a blog and other band info. Letthelightin In July 2011, Qkumba Zoo released an album with Souvenir Records called Letthelightin. The album contains re-mastered songs from their previous album Butterfly Peepl and songs from the N3X+ EP.

It is most famous for serving as the filming site for the Twin Pines/Lone Pine Mall for the 1985 movie Back to the Future starring Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Anchor stores are Burlington, Macy's, and Ross Dress For Less. History =1974-75 opening= Puente Hills Mall was opened in phases over a year from February 1974 through Spring 1975, after the completion of the Pomona Freeway a few years earlier. The first anchor to open, on February 18, 1974, was The Broadway, with three levels and 160,000 square feet. J.W. Robinson's followed, opening in March. Sears followed, and by March 1975 the mall had about 150 shops open. JCPenney opened on April 16, 1975. By September 1975 the mall reported 152 shops open and announced plans for construction of an adjacent 41-acre auto mall and home improvement and home furnishings retail district. The mall has a cross-shaped design and was developed by The Hahn Company. =1990s= In 1993, J.W. Robinson's rebranded as Robinsons-May, after the chain merged with May Company. In 1996, two anchor stores, The Broadway (at the time purchased by Macy's) and JCPenney, were closed. At the time of JCPenney's departure, the mall was at about 50% occupancy. The mall was extensively renovated afterwards and features a 20-screen AMC Theatres megaplex, and stores traditionally found in power centers such as 24 Hour Fitness and Burlington Coat Factory, in addition to the remaining two original anchors, Robinsons-May and Sears. Ross Dress for Less, Circuit City, Linens 'n Things, Spectrum Club, Burlington Coat Factory, and CompUSA all opened in 1998. =2000s= In September 2006, Robinsons-May rebranded as Macy's, after Federated purchased The May Department Stores Company in 2005. Linens 'n Things, Circuit City, and CompUSA all closed their locations at the mall in 2008 and 2009. Circuit City and CompUSA had both gone bankrupt while Linens 'n Things was closed as part of a strategy to focus on online shopping. On August 28, 2010, the Japanese sports entertainment chain Round1 opened the first U.S. location of Round1 Bowling & Amusement, a video game arcade and bowling alley, as a new anchor. It was the company's first overseas store, replacing Linens 'n Things. The southern side of Puente Hills Mall as seen from Colima Road in 2019 The center of the mall previously featured a large cubed water fountain, then a merry-go-round attraction built in 1990, but it was later removed by the mall's owners, Krausz Companies, as they were losing money in its operation. An East Asian-style koi pond replaced the carousel, but was removed as of 2006. The koi were moved to Sycamore Lake at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier. The mall underwent a full interior makeover in 2007 after the removal of the koi pond. Due to the large and influential Asian immigrant populations residing and/or operating businesses in nearby areas (notably in Industry, Hacienda Heights, Rowland Heights, Walnut, and Diamond Bar), some redesigns of the mall incorporated feng shui principles. =Store closures since 2018= Toys \\"R\\" Us opened in June 2011, taking the spot previously occupied by Circuit City. Toys \\"R\\" Us had formerly been located at the Plaza at Puente Hills on Gale Avenue in Industry. It closed along with all Toys 'R' Us stores in early 2018, shutting down on April 15, 2018. On May 31, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 72 stores nationwide. The store closed in September 2018. On December 1, 2019, Forever 21 announced it would close the Puente Hills Mall store along with 21 other locations in California & 90 stores nationwide. The store closed in January 2020. Back to the Future Puente Hills Mall served as a filming location for the fictional Twin Pines Mall (later Lone Pine Mall) in the 1985 film Back to the Future. In the film, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) uses the mall's south parking lot (visible in the above photograph) to stage his time travel experiments with the DeLorean time machine. The JCPenney and Robinson's stores feature prominently in the background. A Ross Dress for Less store can be seen in a strip mall across the street. The scenes were filmed in January 1985. According to the DVD audio commentary, screenplay writer Bob Gale says that several fans gathered at the Puente Hills Mall in the early hours of October 26, 1985, the date given in the film as the present day, to see if anything would happen. Puente Hills Mall featured replicas of the Twin Pines Mall sign, the time machine, and Dr. E. Brown Enterprises truck in its parking lot in October 2015.

It is headquartered in Downers Grove, Illinois. History InterVarsity Press began as a small service branch of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship (IVCF) campus ministry, which had its U.S. beginnings in the 1939‚Äì1940 academic year. At first IVP imported books from Inter-Varsity Press in Great Britain, which despite the similar name is a different publisher, for use by college students and IVCF chapters in the United States. IVP's first home-grown publication was a Bible study guide, Discovering the Gospel of Mark, written by an IVCF staff member and published under the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship name in the 1943‚Äì1944 academic year. In 1947 IVP's formal publishing program was established; since that date books have been published under the InterVarsity Press name. In 1960 IVP's editorial offices moved from Havertown, Pennsylvania, to Chicago, where the IVCF offices were then located. In 1965 IVP published its first bestseller, How to Give Away Your Faith by Paul Little. In 1966 IVP also moved its offices from Chicago to Downers Grove, approximately 30 miles west. In 1968 Jim Nyquist became IVP's full-time director and Jim Sire became IVP's first full-time editor. Shortly afterward, IVP began publishing Francis Schaeffer‚Äôs works, beginning with The God Who Is There. Over the course of the 1970s and 80s, many of IVP's key books were published, including Knowing God by J. I. Packer (1973), The Singer by Calvin Miller (1975), The Fight by John White (1976), The Universe Next Door by James W. Sire (1976), Out of the Saltshaker by Rebecca Manley Pippert (1979) and A Long Obedience in the Same Direction by Eugene H. Peterson (1980). In 1984 Linda Doll became director of IVP. The next year LifeGuide Bible Studies were launched; they have now sold over 10 million copies. In 1990, Ken DeRuiter became executive director of IVP. Then in 1997, after Ken DeRuiter's retirement, Bob Fryling joined IVP as director. IVP had built a warehouse/distribution center in nearby Westmont during 1979. In January 1995, after 29 years in Downers Grove, IVP moved to new offices constructed adjacent to the distribution center. Today InterVarsity Press has a staff of nearly one hundred, publishing ninety to one hundred titles every year. IVP has more than one thousand books, Bible studies and booklets in print, shipping more than 2.3 million books each year. In 2009 IVP won several Theologos awards.InterVarsity Press wins Theologos Awards. Christianretailing.com (2010-03-11). Retrieved on 2013-07-26. Bibliography *Heart. Soul. Mind. Strength.

It is the second-most widely planted species of millet, and the most grown millet species in Asia. Oldest evidence of foxtail millet is found along the ancient course of Yellow river in Cishan, China, carbon dated to be 8700 BC. Foxtail millet has also been grown in India since antiquity. Other names for the species include dwarf setaria, foxtail bristle-grass, giant setaria, green foxtail, Italian millet, German millet, and Hungarian millet. Description Foxtail millet is an annual grass with slim, vertical, leafy stems which can reach a height of . The seedhead is a dense, hairy panicle long. The small seeds, around in diameter, are encased in a thin, papery hull which is easily removed in threshing. Seed color varies greatly between varieties.

The grain obtained from it is called jopsal (Ï¢ÅÏåÄ), a word that is commonly used in Korean as a metaphor for pettiness or innumerable small things (such as bumps of a skin rash). Mandarin Chinese: su (Á≤ü). Also called xi«éom«ê (Â∞èÁ±≥), which is the term commonly used for the grain after it has been husked (husks have been removed); unhusked grain is called guzi (Á©ÄÂ≠ê) in Northern China. * or () * *, , or ; (millet flour). The gruel made from millet, the staple of Ancient Tamils, is called , , , or . * *Gurung : Tohro  Cultivation  In India, foxtail millet is still an important crop in its arid and semi-arid regions. In South India, it has been a staple diet among people for a long time from the Sangam period. It is referred to often in old Tamil texts and is commonly associated with Lord Muruga and his consort Valli. In China, foxtail millet is the most common millet and one of the main food crops, especially among the poor in the dry northern part of that country. In Southeast Asia, foxtail millet is commonly cultivated in its dry, upland regions. In Europe and North America it is planted at a moderate scale for hay and silage, and to a more limited extent for birdseed. In the northern Philippines, foxtail millet was once an important staple crop, until its later replacement by wet- rice and sweet potato cultivation. It is a warm season crop, typically planted in late spring. Harvest for hay or silage can be made in 65‚Äì70 days (typical yield is 15,000‚Äì20,000 kg/ha of green matter or 3,000‚Äì4,000 kg/ha of hay), and for grain in 75‚Äì90 days (typical yield is 800‚Äì900 kg/ha of grain). Its early maturity and efficient use of available water make it suitable for raising in dry areas. Diseases of foxtail millet include leaf and head blast disease caused by Magnaporthe grisea, smut disease caused by Ustilago crameri, and green ear caused by Sclerospora graminicola. The unharvested crop is also susceptible to attack by birds and rodents. History and domestication The wild antecedent of foxtail millet has been securely identified as Setaria viridis, which is interfertile with foxtail millet; wild or weedy forms of foxtail millet also exist. Zohary and Hopf note that the primary difference between the wild and cultivated forms is \\"their seed dispersal biology. Wild and weedy forms shatter their seed while the cultivars retain them.\\"Daniel Zohary and Maria Hopf, Domestication of plants in the Old World, third edition (Oxford: University Press, 2000), p. 86-88 The reference genome for foxtail millet was completed in 2012. Genetic comparisons also confirm that S. viridis is the antecedent of S. italica. The earliest evidence of the cultivation of this grain comes from the Peiligang culture of China, which also cultivated Panicum miliaceum, but foxtail millet became the predominant grain only with the Yangshao culture. More recently, the Cishan culture of China has been identified as the earliest to domesticate foxtail millet around 6500‚Äì5500 BC. The earliest evidence for foxtail millet cultivation outside of its native distribution is at Chengtoushan in the Middle Yangtze River region, dating to around 4000 BC. In southern China, foxtail millet reached the Chengdu Plain (Baodun) at around 2700 BC and Guangxi (, near the Vietnamese border) at around 3000 BC. Foxtail millet also reached Taiwan (Nankuanli, Dapenkeng culture) at around 2800 BC and the Tibetan Plateau (Karuo) at around 3000 BC. Foxtail millet likely reached Southeast Asia via multiple routes. The earliest evidence for foxtail millet in Southeast Asia comes from various sites in the Khao Wong Prachan Valley in central Thailand, with the site at providing the earliest date with direct AMS dating to around 2300 BC. The earliest evidence for foxtail millet in East Siberia comes from the archaeological site at Krounovka 1 in Primorsky Krai, dating to around 3620‚Äì3370 BC. The earliest direct evidence for foxtail millet in Korea come from Dongsam-dong Shell Midden, a Jeulmun site in southern Korea, with a direct AMS date of around 3,360 BC. In Japan, the earliest evidence for foxtail millet comes from the J≈çmon site at Usujiri in Hokkaido, dating to around 4,000 BP. Foxtail millet arrived in Europe later; carbonized seeds first appear in the second millennium BC in central Europe. The earliest definite evidence for its cultivation in the Near East is at the Iron Age levels at Tille Hoyuk in Turkey, with an uncorrected radiocarbon date of about 600 BC.

This \\"strong version\\" of the hypothesis is largely now discredited,Pinker, Steven (1994). The Language Instinct. New York: HarperCollins. pp. 54-55 though the basic notion that Eskimo languages have many more root words for \\"snow\\" than the English language is itself supported by a single 2010 study.Krupnik, Igor et al. (2010) \\"Franz Boas and Inuktitut terminology for ice and snow: from the emergence of the field to the 'Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax'\\". in Krupnik et al. (2010). SIKU: Knowing our Ice: Documenting Inuit Sea-Ice knowledge and Use. New York, NY: Springer. pp.385‚Äì410. Overview Franz Boas did not make quantitative claims but rather pointed out that the Eskimo‚ÄìAleut languages have about the same number of distinct word roots referring to snow as English does, but the structure of these languages tends to allow more variety as to how those roots can be modified in forming a single word.Geoffrey K. Pullum's explanation in Language Log: The list of snow-referring roots to stick [suffixes] on isn't that long [in the Eskimoan language group]: qani- for a snowflake, apu- for snow considered as stuff lying on the ground and covering things up, a root meaning \\"slush\\", a root meaning \\"blizzard\\", a root meaning \\"drift\\", and a few others -- very roughly the same number of roots as in English. Nonetheless, the number of distinct words you can derive from them is not 50, or 150, or 1500, or a million, but simply unbounded. Only stamina sets a limit. A good deal of the ongoing debate thus depends on how one defines \\"word\\", and perhaps even \\"word root\\". The first re-evaluation of the claim was by linguist Laura Martin in 1986, who traced the history of the claim and argued that its prevalence had diverted attention from serious research into linguistic relativity. A subsequent influential and humorous, and polemical, essay by Geoff Pullum repeated Martin's critique, calling the process by which the so-called \\"myth\\" was created the \\"Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax\\". Pullum argued that the fact that the number of word roots for snow is about equally large in Eskimoan languages and English indicates that there exists no difference in the size of their respective vocabularies to define snow. Other specialists in the matter of Eskimoan languages and Eskimoan knowledge of snow and especially sea ice argue against this notion and defend Boas's original fieldwork amongst the Inuit of Baffin Island.Igor Krupnik, Ludger M√ºller- Wille, Franz Boas and Inuktitut Terminology for Ice and Snow: From the Emergence of the Field to the \\"Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax\\", SIKU: Knowing Our Ice, Springer Verlag, 2010.\\"On 'Eskimo Words for Snow': The Life Cycle of a Linguistic Misconception,\\" by Piotr Cichocki and Marcin Kilarski (Historiographia Linguistica) 37, 2010, Pages 341-377 Languages in the Inuit and Yupik language groups add suffixes to words to express the same concepts expressed in English and many other languages by means of compound words, phrases, and even entire sentences. One can create a practically unlimited number of new words in the Eskimoan languages on any topic, not just snow, and these same concepts can be expressed in other languages using combinations of words. In general and especially in this case, it is not necessarily meaningful to compare the number of words between languages that create words in different ways due to different grammatical structures.The Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax, Geoffrey Pullum, Chapter 19, p. 159-171 of The Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax and Other Irreverent Essays on the Study of Language, Geoffrey K. Pullum, With a Foreword by James D. McCawley. 246 p., 1 figure, 2 tables, Spring 1991, LC: 90011286, On the other hand, some anthropologists have argued that Boas, who lived among Baffin islanders and learnt their language, did in fact take account of the polysynthetic nature of Inuit language and included \\"only words representing meaningful distinctions\\" in his account.David Robson, New Scientist 2896, December 18 2012, Are there really 50 Eskimo words for snow?, \\"Yet Igor Krupnik, an anthropologist at the Smithsonian Arctic Studies Center in Washington DC believes that Boas was careful to include only words representing meaningful distinctions. Taking the same care with their own work, Krupnik and others have now charted the vocabulary of about 10 Inuit and Yupik dialects and conclude that there are indeed many more words for snow than in English (SIKU: Knowing Our Ice, 2010). Central Siberian Yupik has 40 such terms, whereas the Inuit dialect spoken in Nunavik, Quebec, has at least 53, including matsaaruti, wet snow that can be used to ice a sleigh's runners, and pukak, for the crystalline powder snow that looks like salt. For many of these dialects, the vocabulary associated with sea ice is even richer.\\" Studies of the Sami languages of Norway, Sweden and Finland, conclude that the languages have anywhere from 180 snow- and ice- related words and as many as 300 different words for types of snow, tracks in snow, and conditions of the use of snow.Ole Henrik Magga, Diversity in Saami terminology for reindeer, snow, and ice, International Social Science Journal Volume 58, Issue 187, pages 25‚Äì34, March 2006.Nils Jernsletten,- \\"Sami Traditional Terminology: Professional Terms Concerning Salmon, Reindeer and Snow\\", Sami Culture in a New Era: The Norwegian Sami Experience. Harald Gaski ed. Karasjok: Davvi Girji, 1997.Yngve Ryd. Sn√∂--en rensk√∂tare ber√§ttar. Stockholm: Ordfront, 2001.  Origins and significance  The first reference to Inuit having multiple words for snow is in the introduction to Handbook of American Indian languages (1911) by linguist and anthropologist Franz Boas. He says: The essential morphological question is why a language would say, for example, \\"lake\\", \\"river\\", and \\"brook\\" instead of something like \\"waterplace\\", \\"waterfast\\", and \\"waterslow\\". English has many snow-related words,Some of them are borrowed from other languages, like firn (German), n√©v√© (French), penitentes (Spanish) and sastrugi (Russian). but Boas's intent may have been to connect differences in culture with differences in language. Edward Sapir's and Benjamin Whorf's hypothesis of linguistic relativity holds that the language we speak both affects and reflects our view of the world. This idea is also reflected in the concept behind general semantics. In a popular 1940 article on the subject, Whorf referred to Eskimo languages having several words for snow: Later writers, prominently Roger Brown in his \\"Words and things\\" and Carol Eastman in her \\"Aspects of Language and Culture\\", inflated the figure in sensationalized stories: by 1978, the number quoted had reached fifty, and on February 9, 1984, an unsigned editorial in The New York Times gave the number as one hundred. However, the linguist G. Pullum shows that Inuit and other related dialects do not possess an extraordinarily large number of terms for snow.  Defining \\"Eskimo\\"  There is no one Eskimo language. A number of cultures are referred to as Eskimo, and a number of different languages are termed Eskimo‚ÄìAleut languages. These languages may have more or fewer words for \\"snow\\", or perhaps more importantly, more or fewer words that are commonly applied to snow, depending on which language is considered. Three distinct word roots with the meaning \\"snow\\" are reconstructed for the Proto-Eskimo languageFortescue, Michael, Steven Jacobson, and Lawrence Kaplan. 1993.

The original version was directed by Ren√© Laloux, and was based on Jean-Pierre Andrevon's 1969 novel Les Hommes-machines contre Gandahar (The Machine-Men versus Gandahar). Plot The peaceful people of Gandahar are suddenly attacked by an army of automata known as the Men of Metal, that march through the villages and kidnap their victims by turning them to stone. The resulting statues are collected and then transferred to their base. At the capital city of Jasper, the Council of Women orders Sylvain to investigate. On his journey, he encounters the Deformed, a race of mutant beings who were accidentally created via genetic experimentation by Gandahar's scientists. Despite their resentment, they are also threatened by the Men of Metal and offer to help Sylvain. Sylvain later saves Airelle, a Gandaharian woman. Together they discover the Men of Metal's base, where the frozen Gandaharians are taken through a large portal and are seemingly assimilated into more Men of Metal. The two stow away on a nearby boat which heads towards the middle of the ocean where they encounter Metamorphis, a giant brain. Sylvain and Airelle are captured and confronted by Metamorphis, who tells them that although the Men of Metal believe that he is their leader, he did not create them nor order their attack. He states that he does not want to see Gandahar fall, and that he needs time to figure out the connection between him and the Men of Metal. He then returns Sylvain and Airelle to Jasper where they learn that Metamorphis, like the Deformed, was also an experiment by Gandaharian scientists. Due to his rapid growth and increasingly violent behavior, he was abandoned in the ocean. Sylvain is ordered to kill Metamorphis with a special syringe. Sylvain returns to Metamorphis, who maintains his innocence but reveals that the Men of Metal come from the future via the portal Sylvain saw earlier. He then urges Sylvain to kill him in a thousand years, as the syringe would have no effect on him now. A skeptical Sylvain agrees and Metamorphis puts him into stasis. A thousand years later, Sylvain awakens just as they had agreed. He comes across the Deformed, who explain the true nature behind the Men of Metal: Due to Metamorphis's now advanced age, his cells can no longer regenerate, which drove him to create the Men of Metal and order them to go back in time to capture the Gandaharians so he could absorb their cells to continue living, killing the Gandaharians in the process. The metal comes from Metamorphis's dead cells metallizing with time. The Deformed, however, were abandoned as they were considered undesirable. Sylvain and the Deformed then agree to work together. The Deformed fight off the Men of Metal and rescue the remaining Gandaharians while Sylvain goes to face Metamorphis alone. The Deformed destroy the reservoir supplying Metamorphis with new cells, distracting him long enough to let Sylvain inject the syringe into Metamorphis which kills him. Sylvain, along with the Deformed and the Gandaharians escape through the portal back to their time.

Production work was done by SEK Animation Studio of North Korea. The film is notable for its strange scenery and exotic flora, fauna, and bizarre inhabitants. The design was by the French comic book artist Caza. English version This version was directed by Harvey Weinstein and produced by Bob Weinstein through Miramax Films itself, while noted science-fiction author Isaac Asimov made the revision of the translation. The English title is a translation, not of the original title, but of the original tag line \\"Les Ann√©es lumi√®re\\" (The Light Years) as seen on the French poster.Le Palais des dessins anim√©s (in English) * The English version does not contain most of Gabriel Yared's soundtrack for the original version of the film. New music was produced for certain sequences in the English-language version of the film, these new pieces were created by the combined efforts of Jack Maeby, Bob Jewitt and Jim Klein. * A certain scene in the English version was edited due to sexuality ‚Äì the scene where Airelle and Sylvain are in the nest. In the uncut version, Sylvain is shown removing his shirt, later, he and Airelle are shown lying nude in the nest at night, seemingly after having been intimate with one another. Availability A European DVD release of Gandahar, in French with English subtitles, was released in October 2007 by Eureka!'s Masters of Cinema label. There are currently no plans for a Region 1 DVD release.

Comparison of Faraday-effect image (left) and MFM image (inset, lower-right) of a magnetic film Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) is a variety of atomic force microscopy, in which a sharp magnetized tip scans a magnetic sample; the tip-sample magnetic interactions are detected and used to reconstruct the magnetic structure of the sample surface. Many kinds of magnetic interactions are measured by MFM, including magnetic dipole‚Äìdipole interaction. MFM scanning often uses non-contact AFM (NC-AFM) mode. Overview In MFM measurements, the magnetic force between the sample and the tip can be expressed as :\\\\vec F=\\\\mu_o (\\\\vec m \\\\cdot abla ) \\\\vec H \\\\,\\\\\\\\! where \\\\vec m \\\\, \\\\\\\\! is the magnetic moment of the tip (approximated as a point dipole), \\\\vec H \\\\, \\\\\\\\! is the magnetic stray field from the sample surface, and ¬µ0 is the magnetic permeability of free space. Because the stray magnetic field from the sample can affect the magnetic state of the tip, and vice versa, interpretation of the MFM measurement is not straightforward. For instance, the geometry of the tip magnetization must be known for quantitative analysis. Typical resolution of 30 nm can be achieved, although resolutions as low as 10 to 20 nm are attainable.Nanoscan AG, Quantum Leap in Hard Disk Technology Important dates A boost in the interest to MFM resulted from the following inventions: Scanning tunneling microscope (STM) 1982, Tunneling current between the tip and sample is used as the signal. Both the tip and sample must be electrically conductive. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) 1986, forces (atomic/electrostatic) between the tip and sample are sensed from the deflections of a flexible lever (cantilever). The cantilever tip flies above the sample with a typical distance of tens of nanometers. Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM), 1987Magnetic Force Microscopy Derives from AFM. The magnetic forces between the tip and sample are sensed. Image of the magnetic stray field is obtained by scanning the magnetized tip over the sample surface in a raster scan.History of Probing Methods MFM components The main components of an MFM system are: *Piezoelectric scanning *Moves the sample in an x, y and z directions. *Voltage is applied to separate electrodes for different directions. Typically, a 1 volt potential results in 1 to 10 nm displacement. *Image is put together by slowly scanning sample surface in a raster fashion. *Scan areas range from a few to 200 micrometers. *Imaging times range from a few minutes to 30 minutes. *Restoring force constants on the cantilever range from 0.01 to 100 N/m depending on the material of the cantilever. *Magnetized tip at one end of a flexible lever (cantilever); generally an AFM probe with a magnetic coating. *In the past, tips were made of etched magnetic metals such as nickel. *Nowadays, tips are batch fabricated (tip-cantilever) using a combination of micromachining and photolithography. As a result, smaller tips are possible, and better mechanical control of the tip-cantilever is obtained. *Cantilever: can be made of single-crystalline silicon, silicon dioxide (SiO2), or silicon nitride (Si3N4). The Si3N4 cantilever-tip modules are usually more durable and have smaller restoring force constants (k). *Tips are coated with a thin (< 50 nm) magnetic film (such as Ni or Co), usually of high coercivity, so that the tip magnetic state (or magnetization M) does not change during the imaging. *The tip-cantilever module is driven close to the resonance frequency by a piezoelectric crystal with typical frequencies ranging from 10 kHz to 1 MHz. Scanning procedure Often, MFM is operated with the so-called \\"lift height\\" method.Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) manual When the tip scans the surface of a sample at close distances (< 10 nm), not only magnetic forces are sensed, but also atomic and electrostatic forces. The lift height method helps to enhance the magnetic contrast through the following: *First, the topographic profile of each scan line is measured. That is, the tip is brought into a close proximity of the sample to take AFM measurements. *The magnetized tip is then lifted further away from the sample. *On the second pass, the magnetic signal is extracted.I. Alvarado, \\"Procedure to Perform Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) with VEECO Dimension 3100 AFM\\", NRF, 2006 Modes of operation =Static (DC) mode= The stray field from the sample exerts a force on the magnetic tip. The force is detected by measuring the displacement of the cantilever by reflecting a laser beam from it. The cantilever end is either deflected away or towards the sample surface by a distance Œîz = Fz/k (perpendicular to the surface). Static mode corresponds to measurements of the cantilever deflection. Forces in the range of tens of piconewtons are normally measured. =Dynamic (AC) mode= For small deflections, the tip-cantilever can be modeled as a damped harmonic oscillator with an effective mass (m) in [kg], an ideal spring constant (k) in [N/m], and a damper (D) in [N¬∑s/m].Cantilever Analysis If an external oscillating force Fz is applied to the cantilever, then the tip will be displaced by an amount z. Moreover, the displacement will also harmonically oscillate, but with a phase shift between applied force and displacement given by: :F_z=F_o \\\\cos(\\\\omega t), \\\\; z=z_o \\\\cos(\\\\omega t + \\\\theta)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! where the amplitude and phase shifts are given by: :z_o= \\\\frac{{\\\\frac{F_o} {m}}}{(\\\\omega_n^2 - \\\\omega^2) + (\\\\frac{\\\\omega_n \\\\omega} {Q})^2}, \\\\; \\\\theta=\\\\arctan\\\\left [\\\\frac{\\\\omega_n \\\\omega} {Q(\\\\omega_n^2 - \\\\omega^2)} \\\\right ]\\\\,\\\\\\\\! Here the quality factor of resonance, resonance angular frequency, and damping factor are: :Q=2 \\\\pi \\\\frac{\\\\frac{1} {2} k z_o^2} {\\\\pi D z_o^2 \\\\omega_n} = \\\\frac{1} {2\\\\delta}, \\\\; \\\\omega_n=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{k} {m}}, \\\\; \\\\delta=\\\\frac{D} {2\\\\sqrt{mk}}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! Dynamic mode of operation refers to measurements of the shifts in the resonance frequency. The cantilever is driven to its resonance frequency and frequency shifts are detected. Assuming small vibration amplitudes (which is generally true in MFM measurements), to a first-order approximation, the resonance frequency can be related to the natural frequency and the force gradient. That is, the shift in the resonance frequency is a result of changes in the spring constant due to the (repelling and attraction) forces acting on the tip. :\\\\omega_r=\\\\omega_n \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{1} {k} \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_z} {\\\\partial z}} \\\\approx \\\\omega_n \\\\left (1-\\\\frac{1} {2k} \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_z} {\\\\partial z} \\\\right )\\\\,\\\\\\\\! The change in the natural resonance frequency is given by :\\\\Delta f= f_r - f_n \\\\approx -\\\\frac{f_n} {2k} \\\\frac{\\\\partial F_z} {\\\\partial z}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, where f=\\\\frac{\\\\omega} {2\\\\pi}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! For instance, the coordinate system is such that positive z is away from or perpendicular to the sample surface, so that an attractive force would be in the negative direction (F<0), and thus the gradient is positive. Consequently, for attractive forces, the resonance frequency of the cantilever decreases (as described by the equation). The image is encoded in such a way that attractive forces are generally depicted in black color, while repelling forces are coded white. Image formation =Calculating forces acting on magnetic tips= Theoretically, the magneto-static energy (U) of the tip-sample system can be calculated in one of two ways: One can either compute the magnetization (M) of the tip in the presence of an applied magnetic field (H) of the sample or compute the magnetization (M) of the sample in the presence of the applied magnetic field of the tip (whichever is easier). Then, integrate the (dot) product of the magnetization and stray field over the interaction volume (V) as :U=-\\\\mu_o\\\\int\\\\limits_V {\\\\vec M \\\\cdot \\\\vec H\\\\, dV}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and compute the gradient of the energy over distance to obtain the force F. Assuming that the cantilever deflects along the z-axis, and the tip is magnetized along a certain direction (e.g. the z-axis), then the equations can be simplified to :F_i=\\\\mu_o\\\\int\\\\limits_V {\\\\vec M \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\vec H} {\\\\partial x_i}\\\\, dV}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! Since the tip is magnetized along a specific direction, it will be sensitive to the component of the magnetic stray field of the sample which is aligned to the same direction. Imaging samples The MFM can be used to image various magnetic structures including domain walls (Bloch and Neel), closure domains, recorded magnetic bits, etc. Furthermore, motion of domain wall can also be studied in an external magnetic field. MFM images of various materials can be seen in the following books and journal publications: thin films, nanoparticles, nanowires, permalloy disks and recording media. Advantages The popularity of MFM originates from several reasons, which include: *The sample does not need to be electrically conductive. *Measurement can be performed at ambient temperature, in ultra high vacuum (UHV), in liquid environment, at different temperatures, and in the presence of variable external magnetic fields. *Measurement is nondestructive to the crystal lattice or structure. *Long-range magnetic interactions are not sensitive to surface contamination. *No special surface preparation or coating is required. *Deposition of thin non-magnetic layers on the sample does not alter the results. *Detectable magnetic field intensity, H, is in the range of 10 A/m *Detectable magnetic field, B, is in the range of 0.1 gauss (10 microteslas). *Typical measured forces are as low as 10‚àí14 N, with the spatial resolutions as low as 20 nm. *MFM can be combined with other scanning methods like STM. Limitations There are some shortcomings or difficulties when working with an MFM, such as: the recorded image depends on the type of the tip and magnetic coating, due to tip-sample interactions. Magnetic field of the tip and sample can change each other's magnetization, M, which can result in nonlinear interactions. This hinders image interpretation. Relatively short lateral scanning range (order of hundreds micrometers). Scanning (lift) height affects the image. Housing of the MFM system is important to shield electromagnetic noise (Faraday cage), acoustic noise (anti-vibration tables), air flow (air isolation), and static charge on the sample. Advances There have been several attempts to overcome the limitations mentioned above and to improve the resolution limits of MFM. For example, the limitations from air flow has been overcome by MFMs that operate at vacuum. The tip-sample effects have been understood and solved by several approaches. Wu et al., have used a tip with antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic layers in an attempt to produce a dipole only at the apex.Point-dipole response from a magnetic force microscopy tip with a synthetic antiferromagnetic coating References External links *Magnetic measurements application notes *Ultra MFM project Category:Scanning probe microscopy ","title":"Magnetic force microscope"},{"id":"2200961","text":"Mr Pye is a 1953 novel by English novelist Mervyn Peake. Plot Mr. Pye travels to the Channel Island of Sark to awaken a love of God in all the islanders. His landlady on the island, Miss Dredger, quickly becomes a devout follower of his teachings, and even agrees to allow the person she hates the most, Miss George, to stay in her house. As Pye does good works he gradually feels a stinging feeling on his back. On further investigation he discovers that he has started to grow angel's wings, and after consulting with a Harley Street doctor, he concludes the best thing to do is to stop doing good deeds, and instead does bad deeds. He engages in some deliberately malicious acts, and after a time this results in him growing horns on his forehead.
