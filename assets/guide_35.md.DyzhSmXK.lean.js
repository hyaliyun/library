Dedicated to Gwenllwyfo, a 7th-century female saint about whom nothing else is known, it was used as a chapel of ease for the church in Amlwch, about away. Restored in 1610 and again in the 18th and 19th centuries, it contained an oak screen and pulpit from 1610. It was replaced in the middle of the 19th century by a larger church about two-thirds of a mile (1.1 km) away, to which some of the contents, including a memorial brass plaque from the early 17th century and the church bell, were removed; other items were left behind. The disused church was noted to be in bad condition in 1937, and the roof collapsed in 1950. Little of the structure now remains, as the walls have been reduced to in height. History and location The ruins of St Gwenllwyfo's Church stand near Dulas, in the north-east of Anglesey, Wales. The date of construction of the first church on the site is unknown. There was a church here in medieval times: one 19th-century writer suggested that the present building dates from the 15th century and that the font, probably 12th century in date, was the only surviving part of an earlier church on the site. Restoration work was carried out in about 1610 and in the 18th century; the latter changes eradicated the church's historical details. The church (dedicated to Gwenllwyfo, a 7th-century woman about whom nothing else is known) was a chapel of ease attached to the parish of Amlwch, about away. The parish tithes, however, were divided between the Bishop of Bangor and the incumbent of St Eilian's Church, Llaneilian. The area takes its name from the church: the Welsh word originally meant \\"enclosure\\" and then \\"church\\", and \\"‑wenllwfyo\\" is a modified form of the saint's name. In 1812, the priest responsible for the church was Edward Hughes, whose wife was the niece of the owner of Llys Dulas, the landed estate in the area. He employed an architect to carry out some further restoration work, although the details are unknown. The church was in need of further repair by the middle of the 19th century, and the congregation needed a larger building. A new church was therefore built between 1854 and 1856 about two-thirds of a mile (1.1 km) away, financed largely by the widow of William Hughes, 1st Baron Dinorben (the son of Edward Hughes). The old church, which was allowed to fall into ruins, stands in a disused cemetery surrounded by trees. Architecture and fittings The nave and chancel of the church were not structurally divided, and measure 39 feet 6 inches by 15 feet 9 inches (12 by 4.8 m). The walls are thick. In 1844, it was recorded as having a coved roof, doors in the north and south walls and windows in the east, north and west walls. It also had a pulpit and an oak screen, high, both dated 1610. The screen had inscriptions in Welsh and Latin, and a note that \\"Richard Williams of Rhodogeidio who married Marcelly Lloyd at his own charge caused all this worke to be don to the honor of God and his church\\". A brass plaque, erected in 1609 by Williams in memory of his wife, was moved to the new church. Another screen was later added at the west end to stop the wind blowing into the nave, and two windows were added on opposite sides of the chancel. Two box pews were installed during the 18th century, and a bell (now used by the new church) was added. At the time of a survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire in 1937, although the building was in bad condition with an insecure roof, it still retained an 18th-century oak communion table, a rectangular font dating from the 12th century, the 1610 screen (damaged), the pulpit, fragments of an oak sounding board (also dated 1610) and some 18th-century memorials. There were also stone benches along the north and south walls, and some wooden benches from the 18th or early 19th century. The medieval roof trusses were also still in place in 1937, but the roof collapsed in 1950. The walls have since been lowered to a height of . Assessment The antiquarian Angharad Llwyd described the church in 1833 as \\"a small neat edifice, appropriately fitted up for the performance of divine service\\". Samuel Lewis, writing in the middle of the 19th century, said that the church was \\"a conspicuous and interesting object\\" in a parish that \\"partakes much of the general character of dreary sterility by which the mining districts in the immediate vicinity are distinguished\\". However, the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones, writing in 1859 about the church as it had been 15 years earlier, said that \\"the whole building was in bad repair\\". One writer described the church in the 1970s as \\"a roofless, forgotten shell\\".

It is not known how it relates to other pottery of the Neolithic period. In the sixth millennium BC Andalusia experiences the arrival of the first agriculturalists. Their origin is uncertain, and though North Africa is a serious candidate, desertification of extensive regions in the few centuries before makes almost impossible archaeological work to retrieve related cultures that for now remain unknown and lost maybe to the sands or coasts; but they arrive with already developed crops (domesticated forms of cereals and legumes). The presence of domestic animals is uncertain, but the known later as domestic species of pig and rabbit remains have been found in large quantities, and though these could belong to wild animals their unique consumption seems to indicate some preference or made up availability to these. They also consumed large amounts of olives but it's uncertain too whether this tree was cultivated or merely harvested in its wild form. Their typical artifact is the La Almagra style pottery, quite variegated. The Andalusian Neolithic also influenced other areas, notably Southern Portugal a few centuries after, where, soon after neolithization, the first dolmen tombs begin to be built c.4800 BC, being possibly the oldest of their kind anywhere. Ca. 4700 BC Cardium Pottery Neolithic culture (also known as Mediterranean Neolithic) arrives to Eastern Iberia. Some ignored these early Neolithic radiocarbon dates noted above looking for a similar archaeological context to the earliest occurrences. They speculated that the origin ranged from Near East, Anatolian and northern Syrian. In this view, the first indication comes from the early Ugaritic, dating from between 2400 and 2300 BC. From these localities it probably migrated to Cyprus. An alternative explanation connected it to the colouration and fabrication technique of the ‘‘Diana style’’ of Lipari (final phase of the Neolithic of Lipari), although the shapes are very different. However, the sixth millennium BC radiocarbon dates confirmed for the archaeological context of the earliest occurrences of this pottery make such speculations untenable since these examples of La Almagra pottery occurred at least 3,000 years before their alleged prototypes in the east Mediterranean.

It was the first successor to the Pioneer. The Diver was invented and built by the same consortium that built the Pioneer in New Orleans. It was composed of Horace Lawson Hunley, James McClintock, and Baxter Watson. They were forced to move their operations to Mobile, Alabama following the capture of New Orleans by Union forces in April 1862. Although ultimately unsuccessful, it served as a model in the development of the consortium's next submarine, the H. L. Hunley. The Hunley eventually became the first combat submarine to sink an enemy warship. History The Diver was designed and built by the consortium in late 1862. Over the course of several months many costly attempts were made to propel the submarine with some type of electrical motor and then a steam engine, but both methods proved to be failures. The steam engine was finally replaced by a hand-crank. The submarine was ready for trials by January 1863. It required four crew members to turn the propeller crank and one to steer and was deemed to be too slow by the team. Nonetheless, it was decided in February 1863, to tow the submarine down the bay to Fort Morgan and attempt an attack on the Union blockade of Mobile. However, the submarine foundered in the heavy chop caused by foul weather and the currents at the mouth of Mobile Bay and sank. The crew escaped, but the boat was not recovered.

It is a comedic fantasy adventure which parodies the barbarians and other stereotypes of sword and sorcery fiction, role-playing games and films such as Conan the Barbarian and the Dungeons & Dragons class, with nods towards the 1980s fantasy boom and its association with traditional heavy metal. It was released in Denmark on September 29, 2011. Plot In the land of Metalonia, the demon Zaal is defeated by Kron, the world's mightiest hero. As Kron dies, a hundred warriors drink his blood to gain his strength, becoming the first Barbarians. Thousands of years later the barbarian clan are the strongest and bravest clan in the world, except for Ronal, a weak and intelligent barbarian who cannot swing an axe or fight. Ronal opts to be the clan's lookout, a relatively easy job as no one dares to attack them. As the barbarians feast, Ronal spots an army led by the evil Lord Volcazar. He attempts to blow the warning horn but his lungs are too weak and the barbarians are taken by surprise. Ronal's uncle Gundar is killed and all the other barbarians are captured. The only two left behind are Ronal and Aliberth, a travelling bard in training. Ronal travels to an oracle for help and Aliberth decides to accompany him. The oracle reveals that Volcazar wears a magical suit of armour and the only weapon capable of killing him is the sword Kron used to destroy Zaal, which must be wielded by a fearless warrior. Volcazar's sorcerer attempts to resurrect Zaal using the captured barbarians' blood, but the spell fails as one barbarian is missing: Ronal. Volcazar sends his army to find him. Ronal and Aliberth search for Elvengard, the elven kingdom, to find a library containing the entire world's wisdom, hopefully including the location of Kron's sword. Suddenly, they are confronted by a young shield-maiden named Zandra who beats up any warrior who attempts to challenge her. Ronal tearfully begs Zandra to spare his life, and she reluctantly agrees as he is not a worthy challenger. Aliberth suggests she could be the fearless warrior the oracle spoke of and Zandra agrees to help save the barbarians. They travel towards a village where an elf lives, Elric, an effeminate elven archer, who agrees to guide them. Zandra is challenged by a strong warrior but Ronal's attempt to avoid a fight leads to him duelling instead. He is saved by the arrival of Volcazar's soldiers and they flee in the chaos. Elric leads them to the gate of the elven kingdom, a dangerous stone passageway. Ronal insists on going around instead, angering the spirits guarding the gate who set off a trap, almost crushing them. Zandra angrily criticizes Ronal for avoiding problems instead of solving them. Ronal decides to sneak inside the library rather than fight the guards and uses an invisibility potion to go unseen (though the potion fails to obscure his testicles). He succeeds in retrieving the location of the sword inside Kron's tomb, impressing Zandra. That night, Zandra tells Ronal that shield-maidens can only marry men who defeat them in battle, but she was never defeated and was sent away to find a strong man capable of defeating her and hopes that such a man is among the barbarians. Ronal points out being defeated is not what love is and they have a romantic moment where they admit they enjoy talking to each other. Zandra is suddenly captured by Volcazar's soldiers while Ronal and Aliberth end up being kidnapped by buxom Amazonian women, who have never seen men before and spend the whole night using Ronal for breeding purposes, while Aliberth is made to wait his turn. Zandra attempts to kill Volcazar during her escape but is defeated by his strength and impenetrable armor. Volcazar declares himself her master, forcing her to obey him. Ronal succeeds in escaping the Amazonians, leaving Aliberth behind who wants his turn with the ladies. However his conscience gets the better of him and he escapes as well. Ronal succeeds in finding Kron's tomb and retrieves the sword, only to accidentally drop it. Zandra appears and unwillingly hands the dropped sword to Volcazar. With Ronal captured, his blood and the blood of the other barbarians are used to resurrect Zaal, who combines his power with Volcazar, transforming into Zaal's demon form. Aliberth sneaks inside the fortress and retrieves Kron's sword, passing it to Ronal, who accidentally succeeds in freeing the other barbarians to battle Volcazar's army. Volcazar orders Zandra to execute Ronal but she refuses to kill someone who actually cares about her. Ronal attacks Volcazar with Kron's sword and succeeds in stabbing the same weak spot on his skull Kron once did, destroying both Volcazar and Zaal. With Ronal believed to be dead, the barbarians honor him as the bravest barbarian in history only for Ronal to suddenly wake up, having only been unconscious. As the barbarians celebrate, Zandra kisses Ronal declaring she no longer needs a warrior to defeat her as Ronal has already conquered her heart. They return to the barbarian village where Ronal and Zandra are married, Aliberth becomes popular with the barbarian ladies and Elric becomes the barbarian's new masseuse.

About Fiesta Shows continues to be New England's Largest Carnival. The company now holds over 100 amusement rides. Controversy In the year of 2013, workers of Fiesta Shows sued the fair because the workers were being paid a flat rate of only $400 a week even though they were working 14-hour days, and sometimes as much as 22 hours in a single shift. This was a law dispute because it falls well under minimum wage. Fiesta Shows did not respond with any comments about the lawsuit.

USNS Spearhead was christened on 17 September 2011. History Spearhead undergoing high-speed trials in 2013. Construction of Spearhead began on 22 July 2010, when the ship's keel was laid at the Austal facility in Mobile, Alabama in a ceremony that included officials from the US Navy, the US Army, the state of Alabama and the city of Mobile. At the time, Spearhead was intended for service with the US Army in the 7th Sustainment Brigade as USAV Spearhead. Spearhead was launched on 8 September 2011, though she did not enter the water until several days later; her launch was the moving of the vessel from the shed where she was constructed onto a floating drydock. At the time, she was scheduled to be delivered to the Navy in early 2012, a delay from the original target of September 2011. Spearhead was christened on 17 September 2011. Her sponsor was a former army officer, Kenneth Wahlman; as part of the ceremony, his daughter Catherine Wahlman (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Corps of Cadets class of 2013) broke a bottle of champagne across Spearheads bow. Spearhead, after delivery to the Navy in early 2012, will undergo sea trials and tests, and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 is planned to begin operations, homeported at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek.

It was determined that a design change that Austal recommended to the Navy late in the design phase to save weight has resulted in a weakened bow structure. The first five ships in the class will need to be returned to Austal to have upgrades done to improve the superstructure, at a cost of $1.2M each. The remaining ships which are still in various stages of construction will be upgraded as well.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-14/navy-s-fast-sealift- ships-can-t-stand-buffeting-from-high-seas Role Spearhead, as well as other ships of her class, are built to a modular design that allows them to be rapidly refitted with various equipment within a bay depending on the mission at hand.

History MON 87705 was designed for as a replacement for hydrogenated oils and fats, which are high in trans-fatty acids. The decreased linolenic content allows MON 87705 to have favorable characteristics for deep frying and increasing the shelf life of foods. The Federal Register announced on that Monsanto was petitioning the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service for a nonregulated status determination of MON 87705. The Iowa Soybean Association announced its support for deregulation of MON 87705 on September 1, 2011. On December 16, 2011, the Animal and Plant Inspection Service Granted Monsanto's petition. The soybeans were commercially launched in 2018. Modified mechanisms Engineered to reduce linolenic acid content, MON 87705 suppresses FATB and FAD2, endogenous genes and encoding enzymes that play a role in the biosynthesis of fatty acids. This alteration more than triples oleic acid content, raising it from approximately 20% to 70% of all fatty acids, and reduces the levels of linoleic acid, stearic acid and palmitic acid present in seeds. MON 87705 is also a Roundup Ready derivative, containing the CP4 EPSPS Agrobacterium gene that confers glyphosate resistance. Effects It is believed that MON 87705 can yield up to per bushel more than conventional soybeans. According to Joe Cornelius, Executive Director of Research and Development at Monsanto, MON 87705 has the potential to \\"make a real difference in efforts to produce healthier foods\\", for example, by reducing the saturated fat content by more than 60%. “With the availability of Vistive Gold soybeans, farmers will soon be able to deliver an economical and sustainable source of nutritionally improved soybean oil to consumers and food companies, Vistive Gold soybeans are a breakthrough innovation that represent years of collaboration across the food supply chain. Monsanto worked closely with the food industry, health and nutrition communities and agricultural sector to bring a biotechnology trait with direct consumer benefit. The result, Vistive Gold, is one step closer to reality with the recent USDA deregulation.” An analyst at the Center for Food Safety commented that \\"No animal feeding trials were conducted on [Vistive Gold] to see what would happen when it was consumed\\". =GenØk study= Researchers at GenØk and the University of Canterbury concluded in a collaborative report submitted to the Norwegian government that there were \\"a number of methodological and conceptual weaknesses contained in the [MON 87705] dossier\\". The study outlined concerns that \\"[t]he rates, types and pathways of exposure to MON 87705 have not been sufficiently characterized\\" by Monsanto, which it also said had not presented a \\"convincing case for having either identified or analyzed off-target effects of the novel dsRNAs expressed in soybean MON 87705, or other unintended metabolic changes\\". The researchers found it significant that Monsanto \\"excluded the production of novel small peptides being produced by regular but low level expression of intended dsRNAs,\\" and that it had \\"only argued that they do not exist\\", which was described as lacking a basis in science. \\"The molecular characterization is unsatisfactory for concluding that there are no novel protein-based hazards\\", said the researchers. Further, they found that Monsanto had not \\"addressed several important health issues or substantiated its claims of benefits to be derived from use of MON 87705, including the combinatorial (in food) or cumulative (in environment) effects of both high oleic acid levels and unintended increases and decreases in other fatty acids\\", which was additionally noted as having potential implications for individuals affected by acute respiratory distress syndrome, which can be exacerbated by elevated fatty acid levels or irritation from inhalation. The researchers also derided Monsanto because \\"[t]he standards used for equivalence testing of surrogate proteins in the assessment lack substantive rigor to draw relevant conclusions\\" and for allegedly employing \\"methods and study designs [that], in our view, bias against identification of differences\\".

All three fights have ended in a knockout in the Light Heavyweight Division. At the first meeting at UFC 47, Liddell won by knockout at 0:38 seconds in the second round. By this victory he became the first person to knockout Ortiz. The second time, was a UFC Light Heavyweight Championship bout at UFC 66 in which Liddell won again by technical knockout at 3:59 in the third round. Liddell and Ortiz were scheduled to meet a third time at UFC 115 but Ortiz was forced out of the bout after an injury required him to receive neck fusion surgery. Liddell instead fought Rich Franklin. Background Following his win over Ortiz, Liddell once again established himself as the number one contender for the UFC Light Heavyweight Title. He, along with then champion Randy Couture, went on to become opposing coaches in the first season of the UFC's eventual hit reality series The Ultimate Fighter. After the season's conclusion, Liddell and Couture met for a second time on April 16, 2005 at UFC 52. Liddell was successful in the rematch by defeating Couture via knockout at 2:03 of the first round and thus becoming the new UFC Light Heavyweight Champion. The win, along with his exposure on the show and the UFC's growing popularity, garnered Liddell much media attention and fame. He would go on to become a household name throughout 2005 and 2006 with notable title defenses over Jeremy Horn, Randy Couture, and Renato Sobral. The rubber match with Couture is to date the UFC's largest grossing gate at $3.3 million and was widely marked as the UFC's first major trilogy. Following the loss to Liddell, Ortiz then grabbed back-to-back decision wins over Patrick Cote at UFC 50 and Vitor Belfort at UFC 51 before temporarily leaving the UFC due to contract disputes. Eventually, Ortiz returned in 2006 and defeated The Ultimate Fighter 1 winner and rising star Forrest Griffin via split decision at UFC 59. Following the win, Ortiz resumed his long standing feud with Ken Shamrock. The two were opposing coaches on season three of The Ultimate Fighter and later fought in a highly anticipated rematch on July 8, 2006 at UFC 61, where Ortiz smothered Shamrock to a TKO victory at 1:18 of the first round. Due to the controversy surrounding the stoppage, Ortiz and Shamrock met a third time on October 10, 2006 at Ortiz vs. Shamrock 3: The Final Chapter where Ortiz again dominated Shamrock en route to a TKO victory at 2:22 of the first round. Much like Liddell, Ortiz's exposure on the show, along with his feud with Shamrock, gained him notable popularity and made him the highest grossing UFC fighter in 2006. UFC 66: Liddell vs. Ortiz II Headlining UFC 66 was a championship fight with two of the UFC's biggest light heavyweight stars, Light Heavyweight Champion Chuck Liddell defending his title against former champion Tito Ortiz. This fight was first announced by Ortiz at the UFC 63 weigh-ins on September 22, 2006. In what would be one of the most financially successful UFC events to date, Liddell fought a rematch with Ortiz at UFC 66, which took place on December 30, 2006. Midway through the first round, Liddell caught Ortiz with a flurry punches that dropped Ortiz to the canvas. After taking heavy shot's from Liddell, Ortiz was able to scramble and survive the round. The second round appeared to be more even for both fighters with Liddell neutralizing Ortiz's wrestling ability and Ortiz defending against Liddell's strikes. As the ending of the round neared, Ortiz successfully secured a takedown on Liddell and briefly pinned him against the cage as Liddell scrambled before the bell rang. The start of the third round was again even before Liddell pressured Ortiz with another flurry of punches. After an exchange of blows, Ortiz attempted a single leg takedown but ended up mounted by Liddell, who began raining down a series of strikes that Ortiz could not successfully defend. The referee than stopped the fight and Liddell was declared the winner via TKO to successfully defend his Light Heavyweight Championship for a fourth time. During the post fight press conference, Dana White awarded both fighters \\"Fight of the Night\\" honors. A humble Ortiz congratulated Liddell and declared him the pound for pound best fighter at the time. It was later revealed that Liddell tore his MCL prior to the fight. In addition, during the fight he popped the tendon out on the middle finger on his left hand. Ortiz himself claimed he may have broken his foot during a kick to Liddell's knee. An MRI later showed that it did not break. The Liddell/Ortiz rematch scored the UFC their first 1,100,000 buyrate, a total that would not be achieved again until UFC 91 in 2008. The decline of Liddell and Ortiz Following his second win over Ortiz, Liddell was then set to defend his title against UFC newcomer Quinton Jackson at UFC 71. Despite losing to Jackson in 2003 in the Pride Fighting Championship organization in Japan, Liddell was favored to win the rematch. Liddell however was quickly disposed of by Jackson, losing the fight via KO at 1:54 seconds in the first round and thus losing his title. Liddell returned to the octagon at UFC 76 to face The Ultimate Fighter 2 alumni Keith Jardine where he was defeated via split decision in a closely contested contest. The loss made it the first time Liddell had suffered two consecutive losses. Liddell then met MMA Legend and dangerous slugger Wanderlei Silva at UFC 79, a bout that had been two years in the making. As predicted, the fight was a grueling, bloody slugfest that saw both men exchanging thunderous blows. After a three round war, Liddell was awarded a unanimous decision. The fight would go on to win \\"Fight of the Night\\" as well as \\"Fight of the Year\\" awards. After establishing himself as a top contender again, Liddell went on to face The Ultimate Fighter 2 winner Rashad Evans at UFC 88. Like his previous bouts, Liddell controlled the pace with his strikes and kicks that kept Evans at bay. However, early in the second round, Liddell threw a right uppercut just as Evans connected with an overhand right, causing Liddell to fall unconscious to the mat. The knockout was dubbed \\"Knockout of the Year\\" by MMA-website Sherdog and marking the first time Liddell had been knocked out cold. Following the loss, Liddell attempted to round out his skills with American Top Team in preparation for his next fight against Mauricio Rua. The fight took place at UFC 97 on April 18, 2009. After an exchange of shots from both fighters, Liddell was floored by a punch from Rua in the first round and was defeated via TKO after Rua landed several unanswered punches. After the fight, White declared that Liddell is retired from fighting. White said, \\"I care about him. I care about his health, and it's over, man. It's over\\". White went further, saying, \\"At the end of the day, I care about these guys. I don't want to see anybody stick around too long. You're never going to see Chuck Liddell on the canvas again\\". Ortiz meanwhile attempted to rebound from his loss to Liddell and faced off against Rashad Evans at UFC 73. In a bout that was going his way, Ortiz was docked a point in the second round for repeatedly grabbing the fence. As a result, the fight was declared a draw. Over the next year, Ortiz exchanged in a heated verbal warfare with Dana White. Ortiz claimed that UFC fighters were underpaid and criticized White for trying to use the UFC to promote himself. White himself went on to publicly attack Ortiz by calling Ortiz \\"jackass\\" and claiming him to be \\"not a real fighter\\" in several media outlets. Ortiz then fought the undefeated Lyoto Machida at UFC 84. Despite locking in a near fight-ending triangle choke, Ortiz was unable to keep up with Machida's pace and was picked apart by his punches, kicks, and takedowns en route to a lopsided unanimous decision. The fight concluded Ortiz' stay with the promotion as he chose not to re-sign, citing his frustration with UFC president Dana White as a major factor in the decision. After leaving the UFC, Ortiz was approached by multiple promotions, including the now defunct EliteXC, Affliction and the American Fight League. However, a clause in his old UFC contract forbade him from signing with or fighting for any other organization until approximately April–June 2009. Until his return to the UFC, Ortiz was considered the biggest free agent on the market. On July 17, 2009, both Ortiz and Dana White stated that the pair had made amends and Ortiz re- signed with the UFC a week later. Originally scheduled to face UFC Hall of Famer Mark Coleman, Ortiz instead took on Forrest Griffin in the main event at UFC 106. Whilst Ortiz was able to secure takedowns in the first and second rounds, Griffin showed considerable improvement in his striking and kept the fight standing throughout the third, leading to the split decision victory. The Ultimate Fighter and cancelled third fight During The Ultimate Fighter: Heavyweights Finale, Dana White announced that Chuck Liddell would be coaching against fierce rival Tito Ortiz on the 11th season of The Ultimate Fighter, with the two of them fighting each other on June 12, 2010, at UFC 115. White claimed that the two still hated each other and figured fans would want to see third bout anyway. In the time leading up to the show, Ortiz was criticized for disclosing information in regards to Liddell's alcohol problems. This upset Liddell, who stated he considered the third fight with Ortiz a tuneup fight but now claimed he was training hard to kill him. However, in March, it was rumored that Ortiz was pulling out for as yet unknown reasons and Ortiz would be replaced by former UFC middleweight champion Rich Franklin. This was then denied by UFC president Dana White. On April 7, 2010, White confirmed that Liddell vs. Ortiz 3 would be the main event for the card; however, on April 12, 2010, the main event was changed to Liddell vs. Rich Franklin. Aftermath At UFC 115, Liddell suffered his third consecutive knockout loss when he was defeated by Franklin in the first round by knockout. Following the bout, Dana White declared that Liddell would never fight in the UFC again. Despite his desire to continue fighting, Liddell decided to end his fighting career and announced his retirement on December 29, 2010 at the UFC 125 press conference and stated he would be taking the position of the UFC Vice President of Business Development. Liddell was visibly emotional at the announcement, acknowledging his retirement and an end to his fighting with words of farewell: \\"Most of all I want to thank my fans and my family. I love this sport and I'm excited to go to this new stage in my life and keep promoting the best sport in the world, the sport I love... now that I'm retired\\". Ortiz meanwhile returned to the octagon for the first time since his neck surgery on October 23, 2011 at UFC 121 against his Ultimate Fighter Season 3 pupil Matt Hamill. Ortiz lost the bout by unanimous decision in a lopsided fight, making it his fourth loss in five fights and third consecutive. Dana White hinted after the event at Ortiz's possible release by stating: \\"We all know what happens to guys when they lose four fights in the UFC\\". Despite this, White granted Ortiz one last chance to compete in the 205 pound division. He was scheduled to face Antonio Rogerio Nogueira in the main event at UFC Fight Night 24 but was forced out of the bout after receiving a cut above his eye during training that required stitches. Ortiz made his return at UFC 132 where he faced The Ultimate Fighter Season 8 winner Ryan Bader. Coming in as heavy underdog with his UFC career on the line, Ortiz secured his first victory since 2006 by submitting Bader at 1:56 of the first round and saved his UFC career. Ortiz then attempted to reenter the top 10 of the UFC Light Heavyweight Division by stepping in for an injured Phil Davis to face number one contender Rashad Evans in the main event at UFC 133. Despite securing what might have been a fight-ending guillotine choke, Ortiz was heavily dominated by Evans and was defeated by technical knockout in the second round. According to Dana White, the loss however would not affect Ortiz's career in the UFC. After dropping back-to-back losses to Antonio Rogerio Nogueira at UFC 140 and Forrest Griffin at UFC 148, Ortiz retired from fighting after 15 years competing for the UFC. Prior to his bout at UFC 148, Ortiz became the ninth inductee into the UFC Hall of Fame. Today, many sports and media analysts credit the Liddell and Ortiz rivalry with bringing the sport of mixed martial arts into the mainstream of American sports and entertainment. On September 26, 2019, ESPN announced that as the inaugural special about mixed martial arts on 30 for 30 will be covering the trilogy and feud. The episode will air on October 15, 2019. Third bout Oscar De La Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions made a one-off into the mixed martial arts market during 2018, with a November 24, 2018 at The Forum presented by Chase in Inglewood, California. The event was headlined by the third fight between Chuck Liddell and Tito Ortiz in a hexagonal cage. Ortiz earned his first win in the trilogy, winning by knockout in the first round.

Built in 1807 as a subscription-funded secondary school, it served in that role until 1923. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in October 1970. It now houses an art gallery. Description and history The Red Brick School stands in a residential area northwest of Wiscasset's small commercial center, at the northeast corner of Warren and Hodge Streets. It is a two-story masonry structure, with brick walls, a hip roof topped by a cupola, and a foundation of fieldstone capped by granite slabs. The south-facing front wall is laid in Flemish bond, while the sides and rear are laid in common bond. The front is three bays wide, with windows set in segmented-arch openings topped by brick headers, and a center entrance set in a simple rectangular opening with a small square window to the left. The interior has retained some original finishes despite undergoing alterations for different uses in the 20th century. with The area that is now Wiscasset was settled in the 17th century, and was part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, which mandated education for its inhabitants. The earliest known classes were held in the meeting house of Pownalborough, which Wiscasset was part of, and then in a district school house built in 1792. Since the district school only provided primary education, the present school building was constructed in 1807 by private subscription to provide secondary education. This private school operated until 1848, and another opened in the building in 1854, running until 1923. The building thereafter housed a local American Legion chapter, and served as a local polling place, before being converted into a studio and gallery space in 1958.

After his death, Hammerl's family was led to believe by the Gaddafi regime that he was alive and safe, but held in detention in Libya. His family learned about his death on 19 May after the release of a group of journalists who had been with Hammerl when he was killed. Hammerl was one of five journalists killed during the civil war.Chantelle Benjamin. 2011. \\"Libya 'broke law' over Hammerl.\\" Business Day (South Africa), 14 June.

Retrieved 13 November 2011. Personal background Anton Lazarus Hammerl was born in Johannesburg, South Africa on 12 December 1969 to Ludwig and Freda Hammerl. Hammerl attended King Edwards Primary and Roosevelt High School. When his photographic studies ended in the early 1990s, he began his career in photojournalism. Hammerl also served in Angola with the South African Defence Force. After completing national service, he enrolled at Pretoria Technikon to study photography. In 2003, Hammerl married Penny Sukhraj. They had two children. Hammerl was also a father to a daughter from a previous relationship. Hammerl was a dual citizen of Austria and South Africa. Professional background In 1992, Hammerl began working as a freelance photojournalist for The Star, where he met colleague and mentor, Ken Oosterbroek. A South African, Oosterbroek was a member of the Bang-Bang Club. After working with The Star, Hammerl began to freelance for Associated Press, covering South Africa democratisation and the end of apartheid. In 1995, Hammerl, while continuing his work with The Star, began working as a senior photographer for independent South African newspapers the Saturday Star and the Sunday Independent. In 2001, he became the picture editor and chief photographer at the Saturday Star. From 2006 until his death in 2011, Hammerl went back to being a freelance photojournalist in London. Death According to media reports, on the morning of 5 April 2011, three other reporters beside Hammerl were attacked by Libyan soldiers who shot at them in a remote desert location outside of Brega. These included two Americans: James Foley, a freelance reporter and regular contributor to the Global Post, and Clare Morgana Gillis, a freelance reporter (Atlantic Monthly, The Christian Science Monitor, USA Today), as well as Spanish photographer Manu Brabo. When the shooting started, Foley and Gillis both heard Hammerl yell out, \\"Help!\\" Hammerl was killed and the other three journalists were beaten by the pro-Gaddafi forces and then taken as their prisoners. Foley stated: \\"Once I saw Anton lying there dead, it was like everything had changed. The whole world has changed. I don't even know that I felt some of the blows.\\" Gillis said, \\"We all glanced down at him as we were being taken by, and I saw him just lying in a pool of blood. And then we were put into the truck and our heads were pushed down. We weren't able to see anything that happened after that to him.\\" After the attack in which Hammerl was killed, Libyan authorities gave Hammerl's family false information for some 45 days that Hammerl was still alive. =Timeline of events= Before Hammerl began his journey, two journalists had already been killed while covering the Libyan civil war. Both Ali Hassan al-Jaber and Mohammed Nabbous had been killed in Benghazi during the month of March. In the meantime, the front, although fluid, had moved westward. He flew from London to Libya on 28 March to cover the uprising against Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's regime. According to his family, Hammerl last talked to them 4 April and told them he would drive with a group of journalists to a rural location some distance from their Benghazi base. A day later, Hammerl was killed in the desert outside of Brega. The reporters were headed toward the front lines of battle when they walked into a fight between rebels and Gaddafi forces; the latter shot Hammerl and captured the others. Hammerl's body was left behind in the desert. At the time, eyewitness reports were printed that said the car in which Hammerl and the journalists had been riding was destroyed after its occupants were removed, but no death was reported. Hammerl's family was notified that he was missing and they asked South Africa to aid them in gaining his release. On 7 April, Human Rights Watch contacted Hammerl's wife, stating they believed Hammerl was captured, along with two American journalists and a Spanish photographer, by Gaddafi loyalists. Hammerl's wife contacted the South African consular officials in London and, since South Africa no longer had a diplomatic staff in Tripoli embassy, it passed the information on to officials in South Africa. On 8 April, Human Rights Watch informed Hammerl's family that Libyan authorities confirmed that it had captured four journalists, including Hammerl, the two Americans and a Spaniard. The human rights organisation said the Libyan authorities had said the journalists would be taken to Tripoli and released. The same day, a senior consul official in South Africa said staff from the Turkish embassy would facilitate negotiations for a release as they were acting on behalf of the US government. On 9 April, the South African consular official informed the family that South African President Jacob Zuma intended to visit Libya and would raise the matter of Hammerl's detention with the Libyan government. The suggestion was that a release would probably happen as a show of goodwill by Gaddafi. However, the next day, Hammerl's family was informed that the issue of his release had not been raised by President Zuma's delegation. Zuma was criticised for not raising the issue. By 14 April, the South African government was working with the US, Spanish and Austrian governments to secure his release, as well as that of the other journalists. On 20 April, two photojournalists, Tim Hetherington and Chris Hondros were reported killed in Misrata. South African journalists and photographers demonstrated outside Houses of Parliament in Cape Town, South Africa, and demanded government action over Hammerl's imprisonment. On 21 April, South African journalists and photographers demonstrated in Hyde Park, Johannesburg, to draw attention to the plight of Hammerl. Each of the other three captured reporters emerged, but not Hammerl. Each of the three had been allowed a call to their families by Saturday, 23 April, but Hammerl's family had yet to hear from him. Gillis, initially thought to have been captured with Hammerl, called her parents from detention in Libya, but it was reported in the media on 21 April that Gillis had said Hammerl had not been with her and two other journalists, Foley and Brabo, when they were captured. Hammerl was still believed to be alive. According to a story on 22 April by the Global Post, which is the Boston-based news website for which Foley worked, a Libyan official claimed Hammerl was alive and well. A South African foreign affairs official confirmed this. By 16 April, the Austrian Foreign Ministry said two independent sources had confirmed that Hammerl was alive and well. The confirmation was obtained from a network of contacts in Libya. On 28 April, the United Nations dispatched a three-man task force to Libya to investigate allegations that forces loyal to Gaddafi had committed human rights violations, including the detention of foreign journalists. Supporters rallied people to call for Hammerl's return. By 30 April, an online petition calling for the release of South African photographer Hammerl and the three other detained journalists had received over 32,000 signatures. On World Press Freedom Day, which is on 3 May, vigils were held for Hammerl at St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London, and at the Institute for the Advancement of Journalism in Johannesburg. On 14 May, the Hammerl family launched a \\"Yellow Ribbons of Hope for Anton\\" campaign to mark 40 days and 40 nights since Hammerl last had contact with the outside world. To mark this day, they called on people around the world to wear a yellow ribbon, which has long been used to signify the absence of a loved one. On 17 May, the Libyan government claimed it would release Hammerl. On 18 May, Foley, Gillis and Brabo, as well as Nigel Chandler (an English journalist also being held), were released and brought to the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli. Hammerl's family and friends watched this unfold live on television. With the release of the journalists, the family learned of Hammerl's death and the Gaddafi government's attempt to cover it up. At 22:00 BST, Thursday, 19 May, Penny Sukhraj received a telephone call from the South African authorities and they told her that her husband was now believed to be dead, shot in the desert by pro-Gaddafi forces. Later that evening, Sukhraj spoke to Gillis and Foley, who shared their eyewitness accounts of events on the last day they had seen Hammerl alive, and his death. During their time in detention, they said they had to keep Hammerl's death a secret and were fearful that talking about his situation could endanger their lives and jeopardise their chances of freedom. Before learning of his death, the Hammerl family were getting ready to begin a physical search for Hammerl by sending South African journalist and friend Des Latham to Libya. By 26 May, well before President Zuma made another trip to Libya, the Hammerl family called on Zuma to use his influence with the Gaddafi regime to help locate Hammerl's remains and bring him home to South Africa. On 2 July, more than 400 friends, family and colleagues gathered at His People Church, Johannesburg, to reflect on Hammerl's life. On 8 September, Hammerl's friends, family and colleagues returned to St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, for his London memorial service. The family continues its efforts to locate Hammerl's remains. On 1 November, Sukhraj wrote an open letter to the Libyan people: \\"Dear people of Libya we call on you to please be our hearts, eyes and ears in our search for the whereabouts of Anton's remains.\\"Africa News. \\"South Africa: Hammerl's Wife Appeals to Libyans for Help.\\" 1 November 2011.

The South African government began to work with Austria, trying to recover the body for a proper burial, which required a diplomatic effort involving both sides of the Libyan conflict. On 6 December 2011, a shadow minister of International Relations and Cooperation, charged that the South African government had not revealed the measures it had taken during Hammerl's disappearance or how it had verified his status.Mokgalapa, Stevens. 6 December 2011. \\"DIRCO Must Come Clean on Abduction Protocol\\".

The president of the International Federation of Journalists said, \\"The devastating news of his killing has been made unbearable by the Libyan cover up of his death. We offer our sincere condolences to his wife Penny Sukhraj.\\" Mixael de Kock, deputy chairman of the Johannesburg Press Club, emphasised that journalists must be protected in areas of war and conflict, if they continue to document the process of combat and expose violations of international law as the journalists who covered the Libyan civil war had done.

It is given the number in his catalog of works, indicating that it is amongst the pieces preceding the composition he recognised as his first mature work, Nr. 1 Kontra-Punkte. History Formel, originally titled Studie für Orchester (Study for Orchestra), was written in November and December 1951 immediately after Kreuzspiel and was intended to have been the first movement of a three- movement composition. When he completed the other two movements the following year, however, he decided their more punctual style did not fit well with the more thematic character of the intended opening, and the two 1952 movements became the separate composition Spiel (; ). Only twenty years later did Stockhausen retrospectively discover in the early piece similarities to the formula technique he had devised for his then-latest composition, Mantra (1970). When asked by Maurice Fleuret for a new work for the 1971 Journées de Musique Contemporaine, Stockhausen offered this score, which he now gave the name Formel. The premiere was conducted by the composer at the Théâtre de Ville in Paris on 22 October 1971, on a concert that also featured several other compositions from his days as a student: the Drei Lieder for contralto and chamber orchestra, the Chöre für Doris, the Choral (\\"Wer uns trug mit Schmerzen\\"), all composed in 1950, and the Sonatine for violin and piano from 1951 (; ). Analysis As with several other of Stockhausen's compositions of this period (Kreuzspiel, Spiel, the Schlagtrio, the original version of Punkte, and Kontra-Punkte), Formel gradually transmutes an initial basic pattern of notes into something else. Its form is chevron-like, first broadening the pitch space out from the centre, then systematically withdrawing notes from the middle until only the outer extremes remain—a sort of inside-out version of the procedure used in Kreuzspiel . Unlike its companion works, however, the tone row on which it is based is not treated punctually, with notes isolated from one another, but instead they are grouped into melodic cells . Instrumentation Formel is scored for a small orchestra of 28 musicians: * 3 oboes * 3 clarinets in A * 3 bassoons * 3 horns * vibraphone (with glockenspiel) * celesta * piano * harp * 6 violins * 3 cellos * 3 double basses Discography * Stockhausen, Karlheinz.

Ojeda wrote a column for El Clarín in La Victoria, Aragua, Venezuela. He regularly challenged the government through his column. He was murdered and his body was found on May 17, 2011. Initially, his journalism was seen as a possible motive for his murder, but later police arrested suspects they believed had killed Ojeda for his debts. He is one of four journalists who have been killed in Venezuela since 2002 and whose murders are being investigated by the Committee to Protect Journalists. Career Wilfred Ojeda wrote a regular column, called \\"Dimensión Crítica\\" (Translated: \\"Critical Dimension\\") for El Clarin in Venezuela for 22 years, in which he was often critical of the local government He was also a leader in the opposition party Acción Democrática, or Democratic Action Party, in Venezuela. He was involved with the Regional Legislative Assembly under Jaime Lusinchi and a political secretary in the Ribas Municipality. Death Wilfred Ojeda disappeared on May 16, 2011 at the age of 56. His family last saw him when he left home in the morning. His daughter spoke to him by phone later in the day, which was his last contact with his family. He left to sell garlic, which he sold to support his family. Ojeda had asked his daughter to save him some food for when he returned home later in the evening. Ojeda's family suspected that something was wrong when his cell phone was out of range. Around 3:30 a.m. the family made a trip to local hospitals and the police station. They searched and finally, at 6:00 a.m., they were informed that his vehicle was found in a nearby town. Ojeda's body was found 15 miles away from where his vehicle was located. None of his belongings appeared to be missing. Ojeda, who was found shot in the head, was found with his arms bound, his head hooded and his mouth gagged with tape. Police found traces of blood inside his truck. It was suspected that the murder was a contract killing through a crime organization. His relatives had no knowledge of any enemies or death threats. Investigators have since revealed that Ojeda was allegedly contractually killed by two brothers because of a debt. The police now believe his murder was not connected with his writings. However, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) of the Organization of American States (OAS) is still urging officials not to rule out the possibility that his killing had another motive. Context Wilfred Ojeda's column often criticized Venezuela and the local government. Impact The media in Venezuela have recently been under pressure from different sources, including President Hugo Chavez. Many media outlets had been shut down and others have been restricted leading up to the parliamentary elections. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, the Chavez government has used prior restraint, punitive media regulations, revocation of broadcasting licenses, suspension of journalists, arrests and even buying media organizations.Committee to Protect Journalists. \\"Attacks on the Press 2010: Venezuela.\\" February 15, 2011.

It lies within present-day Aiken County, South Carolina (prior to 1872, in Edgefield District / Edgefield County). The area is alternately referred to as \\"Midland Valley\\". Rising near Vaucluse, South Carolina, Horse Creek enters the Savannah two miles downstream of downtown Augusta, Georgia. Other communities along Horse Creek include Graniteville, Warrenville, Gloverville, Langley, Burnettown, Bath, and Clearwater. While Horse Creek itself is rather insignificant, its potential for water power led to early examples of Southern industrialization, including a textile mill at Vaucluse (1830) and William Gregg's Graniteville Mill (1845). The textile industry continued to play a primary role until the Graniteville Train Derailment and final closure of the Graniteville Mill in 2006. History =17th and 18th centuries= Henry Woodward recorded Westo Indians in the area during his pioneering travels from Charleston in 1674. The Westoes were already well connected with slaveholders in Virginia and terrorized neighboring tribes by their slave raids. The South Carolinians eventually foresaw more profit in trade than in these slave raids, and engineered an overthrow of the Westos in a 1690 trade war, after which the area was briefly occupied by Shawnee (Savannahs) (Bowne 2005). In 1723 the South Carolina Assembly invited the Chickasaw to occupy the area. Located in northern Mississippi, the Chickasaw relied on South Carolina as a source of guns, and agreed to send a colony under the so-called Squirrel King. In 1737 they were allocated a tract along the northern/western bank of Horse Creek, extending from the Savannah River up to Vaucluse. These Chickasaws actively collaborated with the English in the defense of this area, especially during the Cherokee War in 1760. The Chickasaw returned to their homeland shortly before the American Revolutionary War (Cashin 2009: 11-36, 107-123). =19th century= The rapid expansion of cotton farming led to commercial growth, first in Augusta on the Georgia side of the Savannah River, then at a South Carolina competitor founded in 1821 by Henry Shultz under the name of Hamburg. At the end of a growing season, farmers wagoned their bales of cotton overland to either of these towns, for sale into warehouses or onto boats for transport to Savannah or Charleston, and eventually textile mills in the northeastern U.S. and Europe. The farmers could then spend the proceeds shopping for manufactured goods to carry back home (Chapman 1897). 1841 SCC&RR; Schedule In order to divert traffic going by river to the more accessible port at Savannah, the South Carolina Rail Road was completed from Hamburg to Charleston in 1833. At in length, this was at the time the longest railroad in the world, and ran on published regular schedules with the exclusive use of steam power (Brown 1871 and Fetters 2008). Horse Creek's power potential attracted early industries to the area. According to an 1885 survey, \\"Horse Creek crosses the fall line, and has a rapid fall, offering excellent advantages for power... it offers a good example of the large amount of power which can be obtained at small expense from a comparatively insignificant stream if it is only properly developed.\\" (US Department of the Interior 1885: 132-133) An 1883 South Carolina survey noted 1807 horsepower previously developed, and a capacity for perhaps one- third more (SC State Board of Agriculture 1883: 206). The first Horse Creek textile mill, located at Vaucluse in 1830, produced disappointing results. As noted by William Gregg, the causes included insufficient capital investment, excessive diversity of products, lack of a widespread marketing area, and insufficient hands-on management (Gregg 1845 in Tompkins 1899). Gregg, a great proponent of Southern industrialization, built a landmark mill embodying his ideas at Graniteville in 1845. While Gregg's success was well appreciated, it contradicted a Southern preference for the agrarian slave economy, and was not imitated for several decades. Other industries taking advantage of Horse Creek water power were a paper mill at Bath and pottery works above Vaucluse. In 1860, the Benjamin Franklin Landrum pottery works reportedly manufactured 40,000 gallons capacity of stoneware annually, with three employees and a 1 HP water turbine. In the same year, the Lewis J. Miles pottery works manufactured 50,000 gallons with 13 employees and a 4 HP turbine. The famous potter Dave worked there as late as 1863. In 1880, this same establishment had a 35 HP water turbine (Baldwin 1995:95-99). The Charlotte, Columbia and Augusta Railroad was built through the valley in the late 1860s. After the Civil War and Reconstruction, the textile industry entered a period of great expansion (Harper's Weekly article). By 1900, industrial establishments included the Graniteville, Seminole, Vaucluse, ... mills and employment along the Valley was ... (Kohn 1907). =20th century= During this time, a popular winter resort for the wealthy developed at the headwaters of the valley, which eventually became known as the Aiken Winter Colony. The Whitney Polo Field, established in 1882, and the Palmetto Golf Course, begun in 1892, characterize the vacation pursuits, and the horse culture still thrives in Aiken. Thirty residences survive in the Aiken Winter Colony Historic District (SCDAH link). Pat Conroy's essay, Horses Don’t Eat Moon Pies, explored the juxtaposition of wealthy equestrians and the blue collar mill culture of the valley. In 1903 the Hampton Terrace Hotel opened in North Augusta, South Carolina, near the lower end of the valley, connected to Aiken by means of the Augusta-Aiken Railway. Rich, powerful and famous vacationers included John D. Rockefeller, Henry Ford, and Bing Crosby (source?). The textile industries suffered the effects of the boll weevil (1920) and the Great Depression (1930). Labor strife at the Horse Creek Valley mills was a major theme of Erskine Caldwell's book God's Little Acre. After World War II, the industrial economy continued to decline until 2005, when the last mill left standing was impacted by the Graniteville Train Derailment. Nine people in the area were killed by an early morning chlorine spill. According to Avondale Mills, owners of the Graniteville Mill, lingering chemical corrosion over the following months caused extensive equipment damage, ostensibly making the facility uneconomical to repair and operate, and leading to its closure in 2006 (Augusta Chronicle, 12 January 2005 and 1 June 2006). After environmental cleanup, Langley Pond at the lower end of the valley has become a recreation area. This former mill impoundment offers an Olympic-class rowing course and was used as a practice area for the 1996 Summer Olympic Games. The lake continues to host crews seeking warm weather practice areas during the winter months, with regattas attracting over 1,000 rowers (Midland Valley Area link). In July 2011, a movie by Bryton Entertainment titled Graniteville: Past, Present, Future was presented at area movie theaters. It begins with William Gregg, continues to the train derailment in the present, and envisions possibilities for the future.

She brought recognition and market success to many avant- garde American artists. Her establishment, the Downtown Gallery, was the first commercial art space in Greenwich Village. When it was founded in 1926, it was the only New York gallery dedicated exclusively to contemporary American art by living artists. Over her forty-year career, Halpert showcased such modern art luminaries as Elie Nadelman, Max Weber, Marguerite and William Zorach, Stuart Davis, Peggy Bacon, Charles Sheeler, Marsden Hartley, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Ben Shahn, Jack Levine, William Steig, Jacob Lawrence, Walter Meigs, Arthur Dove, John Marin, Georgia O'Keeffe, and many others. Halpert later expanded her business to include American folk art, and certain nineteenth-century American painters, including Raphaelle Peale, William Michael Harnett, and John Frederick Peto, whom she considered to be precursors to American modernism.Pollock, Lindsay, The Girl With the Gallery: Edith Gregor Halpert And the Making of the Modern Art Market, PublicAffairs, 2006. Although she arrived in the U.S. as a Russian Jewish immigrant of modest means, Halpert transformed the landscape of American art, and died a multimillionaire at the age of 70. Sotheby's credits her with putting American modern art auctions on the map with the posthumous sale of her personal collection for $3.6 million in 1973.Pollock, p. 383, 384.Goldstein, Malcolm, Landscape with Figures: A History of Art Dealing in the United States, Oxford University Press, 2000. . Early years Halpert was born Edith Gregoryevna Fivoosiovitch to Gregor and Frances Lucom Fivoosiovitch in Odessa (then Russia, now Ukraine) on April 25, 1900. She had a sister, Sonia, five years older. Shortly after the deadly pogroms of October 1905, Halpert immigrated to New York City in 1906 with her mother and sister (her father died in 1904 of tuberculosis). At this time the family name changed to Fivisovitch. They initially settled on the west side of Harlem, then a predominantly Jewish immigrant neighborhood, and Halpert attended the progressive Wadleigh High School for Girls. At the age of 14, she further Americanized her name to Edith Georgina Fein and began to pursue a career as an artist. She studied drawing under Leon Kroll and Ivan Olinsky at the National Academy of Design and life drawing with George Bridgeman at the Art Students League. Halpert was able to attend the National Academy of Design at such a young age because she convinced her instructors that she was actually sixteen. She was also a member of the Whitney Studio Club and John Weischel's People's Art Guild, a radical artists' cooperative for which she served as treasurer. In 1917, she met the American painter Samuel Halpert through the People's Art Guild, and they married the following year. The couple remained in New York City, where Samuel continued to paint while Halpert worked to support them. In the 1920s and 1930s, marriage was still a popular goal among young women. While many young women worked, most stopped after marriage. However, Halpert continued to work to support her household while Samuel stayed home to paint. In 1925, they lived at the Maison Watteau in Montparnasse, then Paris's liveliest artist community. The following summer, the Halperts stayed at the artist colony founded by Hamilton Easter Field in Ogunquit, Maine. They rented a cottage from Robert Laurent, and mingled with other American artists who were residing there that summer: Stefan Hirsch, Bernard Karfiol, Walt Kuhn, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Katherine Schmidt, Niles Spencer, and Marguerite and William Zorach, all of whom would later join her gallery. Many of the artists in Ogunquit were interested in folk art and used it to decorate their homes and as inspiration in their work. Samuel and Halpert divorced in 1930, just before his untimely death caused by streptococci meningitis.  Business career  Halpert's career began early. In order to support herself and her mother (and later, her husband), Halpert took a number of jobs in rapid succession and became a highly successful businesswoman. At the age of 16, she worked at Bloomingdale's department store, first as a comptometer operator and then as an illustrator in the advertising department. She then worked in the foreign office of Macy's, before becoming an advertising manager at Stern Brothers, eventually working as an efficiency expert for the garment manufacturers Cohen-Goldman and Fishman & Co. Between 1920 and 1925, Halpert served in several roles with S.W. Straus & Company, the bank investment firm that originated real-estate mortgage bonds. \\"By 25, she was one of two female business executives in the city and quite well-off.\\" Halpert had earned a substantial salary and was appointed to the board of directors. Despite her success and high status, she quit her association with Straus at her husband's urging in 1925. This left her with more time to devote to her marriage, and gave her an opportunity to refocus her ambitions on the business of art. Upon Halpert's resignation, she and Samuel traveled to Paris, France, and stayed for nearly a year. Opening The Downtown Gallery While staying in France, Halpert noticed that French artists had more opportunities to sell and display art than their American counterparts. After returning to the U.S., Halpert decided to create a space where she could provide similar opportunities. Flush from bonuses earned in her business dealings, in the fall of 1926, Halpert used that money to open Our Gallery in Manhattan at 113 West 13th Street with her friend Berthe Kroll Goldsmith. The gallery featured contemporary American art, often by friends of Halpert and her husband, artist Samuel Halpert. The following year 1927, the name of the gallery changed to the Downtown Gallery at the suggestion of artist William Zorach. In early brochures, Halpert and Goldsmith described their mission thus: \\"The Downtown Gallery has no prejudice for any one school. Its selection is driven by quality — by what is enduring — not by what is in vogue.\\" The Downtown Gallery, American Folk Art Gallery, and The Daylight Gallery The American Folk Art Gallery, founded by Holger Cahill in partnership with Halpert and Goldsmith, opened in 1929 as the first folk art gallery, installing itself upstairs from the Downtown Gallery. The affinity between Halpert's artists and folk art was strong, and sales of folk art sustained the Downtown Gallery through the Depression. Regular devotees included Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, and Halpert drew on their relationship to convince Rockefeller to provide support for the Museum of Modern Art and, later, The Downtown Gallery. A third space, operating behind the main gallery, opened in 1930. Called the Daylight Gallery, it emphasized art and sculpture displayed in diffuse natural light, and featured elaborate iron silhouette doors Halpert had commissioned in 1929. In a press release, Halpert referred to the new gallery as “a modest moment in American Art.” Fortifying The Downtown Gallery Halpert's business acumen helped her manage prices, and encourage collectors of modest means. Halpert also used marketing and advertising, and worked to get her artists included in museums and public collections to increase their exposure. After buying out Goldsmith in 1935, Halpert winnowed her stable of artists down to twelve, and focused on profitability. In 1940, the gallery relocated to 43 East 51st Street and, in 1945, she moved again, this time to 32 East 51st Street. As an advisor for the WPA Federal Art Project, Halpert had access to many artists outside of New York, many of whom she exhibited. She also hosted exchange exhibitions with the Boris Mirski Gallery, The Downtown Gallery's similarly avant-garde Boston counterpart. Halpert also worked to attract artists formerly represented by Alfred Stieglitz who died in 1946. She also took on artists' estates, including one from former Stieglitz artist Arthur Dove. In 1941, Halpert and \\"her friend Alain Locke, the writer and theorist of black culture, Halpert organized Negro Art in America, a survey of 41 artists that was the first such exhibition in a New York gallery. Not long after, Halpert exhibited Jacob Lawrence's Migration Series, a 60-panel memorial to The Great Migration, which is now owned jointly by MOMA and Washington D.C.'s Phillips Collection. After 1936, all of Halpert's artists were eventually transferred, without the artists' consent to the Alan Gallery, led by Halpert's assistant director Charles Alan. The Downtown Gallery relocated one last time to the Ritz Tower Concourse at 465 Park Avenue in 1965. Contributions to the art world Halpert served as organizer and director of the First Municipal Exhibition of American Art, Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1929. Her work with the WPA Federal Art Project took her to Washington D.C. in the summer of 1936 to develop the Exhibition and Allocation Program, which facilitated nationwide circulation for works from regional art centers. In 1937, she formed the Bureau for Architectural Sculpture and Murals, a central clearing-house from which architects could review and select work by artists and sculptors experienced in working in architectural settings (similar in mission to her Daylight Gallery). Halpert served as curator of the art section of the American National Exhibition, sponsored by the United States Information Agency and the U.S. Department of Commerce; she traveled to the Soviet Union with the exhibition, installed the show, and gave daily gallery talks in Russian. In 1952, to promote art history, Halpert established the Edith Gregor Halpert Foundation. Its activities included assisting universities to fund scholarships for the study of contemporary American art and championing the rights of artists to control the sale and reproduction of their work. In recognition of her dedication to the arts, Halpert received the Art in America Award in 1959, a USIA Citation for Distinguished Service in 1960, and the First Annual International Silver Prize from the University of Connecticut for \\"distinguished contribution to the arts\\" in 1968.

He was the third son of the German Protestant Reformer Martin Luther and was successively physician to John Frederick II, Duke of Saxony; Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg; Augustus, Elector of Saxony and his successor Christian I, Elector of Saxony. He taught alchemy to Anne of Denmark. Early life Born at Wittenberg, the third son of Martin Luther by his marriage to Katharina von Bora, Luther was named after Saint Paul the Apostle and proved such an energetic child that his father said of him, \\"He is destined to fight against the Turks.\\" The boy's education began with the study of Greek and Latin under Philip Melanchthon and Veit Winsheim.John G. Morris, Catharine de Bora, or Social and Domestic Scenes in the Home of Luther, p. 112 In 1546, when Luther was thirteen, his father died, leaving the family in straitened circumstances without Luther's salaries. At the outbreak of the Schmalkaldic War, they fled to Magdeburg and in 1547 to Brunswick. In July, at the end of the war, it was possible to return to Wittenberg, although in relative poverty. On the advice of Melanchthon, Luther attended the University of Wittenberg to study medicine. In September 1552, an outbreak of the Bubonic plague forced the Luther family to leave their home once again. They fled to Torgau, travelling in a cart which overturned near the city gates, seriously injuring Luther's mother. She died there on 20 December 1552. While in Torgau, on 5 February 1553, at the age of twenty, Luther married Anna, daughter of the translator Veit Warbeck (c. 1490–1534). Career Returning to Wittenburg, Luther completed his medical studies and on 29 July 1557 gained the degree of Doctor of Medicine. He turned down an offer to teach at the University of Jena because of his objections to the theology of Victorinus Strigel, a leading academic there. In religion, Luther was an enthusiastic Lutheran and zealously defended his father's teachings. Luther took up a career as a physician. He became the personal physician of John Frederick II, Duke of Saxony, remaining at Gotha until the surrender of the city on 13 April 1567. He was then in practice at the court of Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg until his death on 3 January 1571, and was subsequently physician to Augustus, Elector of Saxony, and his successor, Christian I, at Dresden. In 1590 he retired and took up residence at Leipzig. Luther was also distinguished as a chemist and developed several drugs, such as Unguentum ex nitro, Magistrum perlarum, Magistrum collorum, and Aurum potabile, which were produced by the pharmacies of Saxony. He was interested in alchemy, the ultimate goal of which was the production of gold, and has been claimed as the most significant instructor of the amateur alchemist Anne of Denmark, Electress of Saxony.Jan Apotheker, Livia Simon Sarkadi, European Women in Chemistry (2011), p. 35: \\"Dr. Paul Luther (1533–1593) a doctor and alchemist, may have been her most significant teacher.\\" Luther died at Leipzig on 8 March 1593.

An opening night audience at the New York Criterion burst into a storm of applause at its conclusion, and well the most unusual number deserved it. When the fly's sweetheart is enmeshed in the spiders' web, the army, on wings, on the backs of horse-flies with pins for lances and with dragon flies acting as bombing planes, sweeps to her assistance. Dozens of tremendously clever new drawings and original ideas are incorporated in this smart animated subject. By all means play it, and the audience will talk about it for a week.\\" The Film Daily (Dec 20, 1931): \\"A Knockout. This Disney cartoon is one of the best to come along in moons. For basic idea, ingenious workmanship and effective sound and musical accompaniment it is hard to beat. It shows a flock of flies, and a couple of loverbird flies in particular, disporting themselves in a kitchen. A villainous spider lures a lady fly to his net, whereupon her hero rushes to the rescue, finally calling in the assistance of the entire fly army, which vanquishes the spider.

Like other Symphonies at the time, it utilised the multiplane camera. It was directed by Graham Heid, produced by Walt Disney Productions, and distributed by RKO Radio Pictures. The three children bore similarities to Michael Darling in the 1953 Disney feature film, Peter Pan. Synopsis The three sleepy children sail in their shoe-boat; they stall briefly on a cloud, then have various troubles with their fishing lines. Nod lands a fish-like star that ends up squirming in his pants. A star hooks Wynken and Nod's candy-cane baited lines together. The stars tease Nod while he's hanging overboard. A meteor comes through; they catch it in a net and it tows them wildly, until they land in another cloud, where they are tossed by storms, eventually breaking their mast and sending them back to earth (and their bed, where it becomes clear that they are really just one boy). Reception In The Disney Films, Leonard Maltin says, \\"Wynken, Blynken and Nod is as extravagant as any Disney feature; it set a standard that was probably too extravagant to maintain, with most effort being turned toward feature-film production in the late 1930s.

It is a looped 24-hour video supercut (montage of scenes from film and television) that feature clocks or timepieces. The artwork itself functions as a clock: its presentation is synchronized with the local time, resulting in the time shown in a scene being the actual time. Marclay developed the idea for The Clock while working on his 2005 piece Screen Play. With the support of the London-based White Cube gallery, he assembled a team to find footage, which he edited together over the course of three years. Marclay debuted The Clock at White Cube's London gallery in 2010. The work garnered critical praise, winning the Golden Lion at the 2011 Venice Biennale. Its six editions were purchased by major museums, allowing it to attract a widespread following. Content The climax of Orson Welles' The Stranger is featured at midnight. After midnight, characters go to bars and drink. Some seek intimacy while others are angry to have been awakened by the phone. In the early hours, characters are generally alone or sleeping. Several dream sequences occur between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. At around 7 a.m., characters are shown waking up. From 9 a.m. to noon, they eat breakfast and have wake-up sex. As noon approaches, a sequence of action scenes build up to bells ringing in High Noon. The video's pace immediately slows once noon passes. Between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m., transportation becomes important as characters travel on planes, trains, and automobiles. At 6 p.m., characters eat dinner and have shootouts. In the evening, they attend parties. Around 8 p.m., orchestras and theaters begin their shows. As midnight approaches, the characters become more frantic, throwing tantrums and requesting stays of execution. Screeching violins from multiple clips build up to the moment. At midnight Orson Welles is impaled on a clock tower in The Stranger, and Big Ben, a common sight in The Clock, explodes in V for Vendetta. Production =Conception= The Clock was conceived in 2005 while Marclay was working on the video score Screen Play. He realised that he needed a way for musicians to synchronise with film footage. An assistant at the Eyebeam Art and Technology Center brought him footage of clocks, and Marclay began wondering if it was possible to find footage of every minute of the day. He kept the idea secret for several years, concerned that someone else would poach his idea. After his partner Lydia Yee accepted a position at the Barbican Centre, Marclay moved from New York to London in mid 2007. There he proposed the film to the White Cube gallery, unsure of the project's feasibility. He received a budget of over US$100,000, covered in part by the Paula Cooper Gallery. =Development= Not all scenes show a clock, such as one from Night of the Living Dead announcing \\"It's ten minutes to three.\\" The first several months of production were intended to show that Marclay would be able to find enough material to achieve his vision. White Cube helped him assemble a team of six people to watch DVDs and copy scenes with clocks or time. Marclay himself was often unfamiliar with the source works. They used a Google Spreadsheet to record and search through clips. As the number of scenes available increased, Marclay was able to start working on transitions between scenes. Working in Final Cut Pro, he edited clips together, standardising the video formats and smoothing the audio. He cited Bruce Conner's \\"odd transitions\\" as an influence on his editing. Marclay wanted to include more outlandish, melodramatic clips but worried that it would be exhausting over a long period. He instead focused on incidental moments; his head assistant Paul Anton Smith explained that Marclay wanted to show scenes that were \\"banal and plain but visually interesting.\\" One assistant who focused heavily on scenes of violence was fired, and the remaining assistants began to specialise in individual film genres. After six months, Marclay presented White Cube with several extended sequences, confident that he would eventually be able to finish the project. The footage began taking up too much capacity, so he worked on two Power Mac G5s with footage split by time of day. Marclay organised files by hour, which became like chapters for him. Each folder suggested different themes to him, allowing him to form loose narratives. He spent three years editing scenes together. Some of the scenes not selected for The Clock became a part of his 2012 performance piece Everyday. In mid 2010, Marclay recruited Quentin Chiappetta, a sound designer with whom he had worked before, to work on the audio for The Clock. He saved files to disc and sent them to Chiappetta so that the films' soundtracks could be equalised. By September Marclay realised that hundreds of the audio transitions were lacking, with White Cube set to premiere The Clock the following month. Because of his background as a DJ, he did not want to use simple fades between clips. He went to Chiappetta's MediaNoise studio in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where the two worked on the soundtrack using Pro Tools. In some cases, they created completely new audio for the scenes. During the first week of The Clocks exhibition, Marclay continued fixing continuity errors and working on the audio. The final product used around 12,000 clips. Because of its size, Marclay enlisted professor Mick Grierson to create a program that plays the separate audio and video tracks, synchronised with the current time. The program continues running while a museum is closed so that it remains synchronised. Release Marclay made six editions of The Clock, plus two artist's proofs. Five copies were designated to be sold to institutions for US$467,500 each under the condition that The Clock can't be played in more than one location at the same time. The last copy was sold to hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen for an undisclosed amount. Within a day of premiering The Clock, White Cube received a host of offers from museums, some of which purchased copies jointly. The sale became one of the largest purchases of video art and one of the highest purchases to happen on the primary market. The work owned by the New York collectors Jill and Peter Kraus, is a promised gift to the Museum of Modern Art. In 2011, Steve Tisch pledged the money needed to buy the work for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. One month later, the National Gallery of Canada and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, announced the acquisition of another copy. In February 2012, yet another version was acquired jointly by the Tate in London, the Centre Pompidou in Paris, and the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. =Exhibition= Marclay originally considered making The Clock as a public art piece. However, difficulty with lighting and sound made it impractical. Marclay gave museums specifications for the exhibitions' screening rooms. He wanted the video to be projected onto a screen, in a room with white IKEA couches. Presenting the piece became a source of friction between Marclay and some museums. The Art Newspaper reported that LACMA's director Michael Govan wanted to project it onto the museum, though LACMA denied suggesting it be projected outside. Marclay disapproved of other screening locations suggested by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Tate. In order to ensure that the full video would be exhibited, he required that museums agree to be open for all 24 hours at some point during its run. The Clock premiered 15 October 2010 at White Cube's gallery in central London. Since then, it has attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors and found crossover success beyond art patrons. The Paula Cooper Gallery exhibited it in early 2011, where it attracted 11,500 visitors over the course of a month. In mid 2012, the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts showed it to 18,000 people over six weeks. MoMA heavily promoted its run with a silent disco, a New Year's celebration, and a dedicated @TheClockatMoMA account on Twitter. The month-long exhibition drew over 40,000 people. =Copyright= When he started to make The Clock, Marclay expected that copyright would not be a substantial obstacle, theorizing that \\"If you make something good and interesting and not ridiculing someone or being offensive, the creators of the original material will like it.\\" He did not get copyright clearances for any of the films used. He stated that although his use was illegal, \\"most would consider it fair use.\\" Because of the film's copyright status, museums have offered it as part of their general admission instead of charging for separate tickets. Reception The Clock has been described as \\"addictive\\" and \\"mesmerizing\\". The Guardian called it \\"a masterpiece of our times\\". Chris Petit complimented its \\"edge-of-hysteria relentlessness, the anti-narrative drive\\", and the simple concept, commenting that he wished he had thought of the idea himself. In The New York Review of Books, Zadie Smith stated that The Clock \\"is neither bad nor good, but sublime, maybe the greatest film you have ever seen\\". Newsweek named Marclay one of the ten most important artists of today. He was included in the 2012 Time 100. At the 2011 Venice Biennale, Marclay was recognised as the best artist in the official exhibition, winning the Golden Lion for The Clock. Accepting the Golden Lion, Marclay invoked Andy Warhol, thanking the jury \\"for giving The Clock its fifteen minutes\\". The film also won in the \\"Best Editing\\" category at the Boston Society of Film Critics Awards 2011 and was included among ARTnews editors' most important artworks of the decade. Interpretations The Clock reveals its plot largely through the use of cutaway shots. A shot indicating the time is followed by a reaction shot with a character's emotional response, often one of anxiety, fear, or boredom. Petit remarked that the impact of repeated reactions lacking context \\"comes over as incredibly weird\\". The sequence interpellates viewers into The Clocks flow, and they often experience a detached, hypnotic effect. Marclay viewed The Clock as a memento mori. In contrast to the escapism that cinema provides, The Clock draws attention to how much time the audience has spent watching it. As they spend more time with the film, its actors reappear at various points in their careers. To make this theme more explicit, Marclay included symbols of time and death in connecting shots. These included sunsets; withering flowers; and burning cigarettes, which he described as \\"the twentieth-century symbol of time\\", a modern version of burning candles. Marclay included shots of turntables and vinyl records not only as a representation of \\"capturing time, trying to hold it back\\", but also as a self-reference to his earlier works that used vinyl. =Relation to other works= Marclay made several forays into video art that informed The Clock. His 1995 film Telephones forms a narrative out of clips from Hollywood films where characters use a telephone. It was a link between Marclay's audio and video art, and its discontinuous structure was a template for The Clock. Telephones broke using a telephone into several discrete steps, each reenacted by multiple films, similar to sequences in The Clock where the act of sleeping or waking is demonstrated by one character after another. His 1998 film Up and Out combines video from Michelangelo Antonioni's Blowup with audio from Brian De Palma's Blow Out. It was an early experiment in the effect of synchronization, where viewers naturally attempted to find intersections between the two works, and it developed the editing style that Marclay employs for The Clock. His 2002 installation Video Quartet is a 13-minute video with four continuous screens of clips from commercial films. Its combinations of coinciding sounds and images were a model for the synchronicity of The Clock. The Clock has been viewed as an extension of similar compilations, particularly by Christoph Girardet. Girardet's 1999 Phoenix Tapes, a collaboration with Matthias Müller, is composed of footage from Alfred Hitchcock's films. It arranges them into clusters to illustrate Hitchcock's techniques and motifs. Girardet and Müller use low-quality footage from VHS tapes to draw attention to their appropriation. In contrast, Marclay seeks to replicate Hollywood production through high-quality footage with standardised sound production and aspect ratios. Girardet's 2003 work 60 Seconds (analog) is a 60-second film intended to be played on a loop. 60 brief shots show the hands of watches and clocks counting the seconds. Girardet wanted to show how interchangeable the cinema footage could be. Müller described it as The Clock \\"in a conceptual, minimalist nutshell.\\" In 2005 Étienne Chambaud presented L'Horloge, a piece of software that displays the time using images of clocks in films. Chambaud's use of still images give L'Horloge a slower, more regular pace, whereas The Clock experiments with the rhythm of commercial films.

Her work focuses on the molecular biology and genomics of the parasites that cause diseases such as elephantiasis, and river blindness, and on the evolution of the influenza virus. She was named a 2011 MacArthur Fellow, a 2012 Kavli Frontier of Science Fellow , and a 2017 American Academy of Microbiology Fellow. She also was Awarded the Chancellor’s Distinguished Research Award in 2010.  Education  Ghedin received two degrees from McGill University; a B.Sc. in Biology in 1989 and a Ph.D. focused on Molecular Parasitology in 1998. She received a M.Sc. in Environmental Sciences from the Université du Québec à Montréal in 1993. Between 1998 and 2000, she was a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Elodie Ghedin continued her postdoctoral research with the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) in 2001.  Career  Starting in 2000, she spent six years at the Institute for Genomic Research before joining the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 2006 as an assistant professor in the Department of Computational and Systems Biology. She was formerly part of the J. Craig Venter Institute. During her time at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine Elodie Ghedin researched filarial nematodes. While she worked with this team they were able to sequence the genome of one of species filarial nematode. Filarial nematodes are parasitic worms that are transmitted through mosquito bites and if left untreated can cause a disease called elephantiasis. Elephantiasis (medically known as Lymphatic filariasis) is a disease that causes extreme swelling of limbs often in the legs and feet. She is currently a parasitologist and virologist at New York University's Center for Genomics & Systems Biology at the College of Global Public Health. Her research covers diverse topics in parasitology and virology, including the genetic diversity of flu strains. She has said: ‘A flu infection is not homogeneous, but rather a mix of strains that gets transmitted as a swarm. Ghedin said current flu vaccines target the dominant strains, because they are the ones that seem to infect the highest number of individuals, but they may miss minor strains, which can also pose a big threat. To examine the contribution of minor flu strains to outbreaks, Ghedin and her colleagues performed whole genome deep sequencing of upper nasal cavity swabs taken from confirmed 2009 Hong Kong flu cases and from their household contacts. Using sophisticated sequencing methods, the team could not only identify variants in flu strains, but also quantify what was being transmitted between infected individuals. Also while working at New York University, Elodie Ghedin was awarded a million-dollar grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to study Zika virus infections. Her results showed that, as expected, most people carried the dominant virus—H1N1 or H3N2. But, in addition, all carried minor strains and variants of the major and minor strains. What was surprising was how readily these variants were transmitted across the studied individuals. She has also noted that children, pregnant women, and people with obesity tend to have longer flu infections. Another collaborative study by Elodie Ghedin with Sara Lustigman of New York Blood Center, and Thomas Unnasch of The University of South Florida measured levels of RNA molecules in both B. malayi and Wolbachia throughout the lifecycles of male and female worms. One of her current projects is to be a collaborator with the GoViral Project, a real time tracking system for cold and flu that aims to accurately track cases across the world.

It has attracted considerable attention among energy policy analysts, because its existence suggests that society has forgone cost-effective investments in energy efficiency, even though they could significantly reduce energy consumption at low cost. This term was first \\"coined\\" by Eric Hirst and Marilyn Brown in a paper entitled \\"Closing the Efficiency Gap: Barriers to the Efficient Use of Energy\\" in 1990.Hirst, E., & Brown, M. (1990). Closing the efficiency gap: barriers to the efficient use of energy. Resources, Conservation and Recycling, 3(4), 267-281.  Introduction  Energy efficiency refers to changes in equipment and behavior that result in increased energy services per unit of energy consumed, while behavioral changes that reduce energy use are often referred to as energy conservation. Energy intensity which measures energy consumption per Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is one indicator of energy efficiency. Many people have attempted to measure the energy efficiency gap, and their approaches differ based on the definitions of the optimal level of energy use. A popular theme is Hirst and Brown (1990)'s definition: energy efficiency gap is the unexploited economic potential for energy efficiency, in other words, it emphasizes the technically feasible energy efficiency measures that are cost-effective but are not being deployed. Many other studies have used this definition, such as International Energy Agency (2007) and Koopmans and Velde.International Energy Agency. (2007). Mind the Gap. Quantifying Principal-Agent Problems in Energy Efficiency.Koopmans, C. C. and D. W. te Velde (2001). \\"Bridging the energy efficiency gap: using bottom-up information in a top-down energy demand model.\\" Energy economics 23(1): 57-75. Jaffe and Stavins (1994) identify five types of optimality and the corresponding definitions of the energy-efficiency gap: the economists' economic potential, the technologists’ economic potential, hypothetical potential, the narrow social optimum and the true social optimum.Jaffe, A. B., & Stavins, R. N. (1994). The energy-efficiency gap What does it mean? Energy Policy, 22(10), 804-810. In particular, economists' economic potential could be achieved by eliminating market failures in the energy efficiency technology market, while technologists' economic potential could be achieved by eliminating both market and non-market failures. Achieving the hypothetical potential would require the elimination of market failures in the whole energy market, for instance, having energy prices that reflect all externalities. The society can achieve the narrow social optimum by implementing all available cost-effective programs, and the true social optimum can be achieved if the environmental effects of energy generation and consumption is taken into consideration.  Barriers for energy efficiency gap  Energy efficiency gaps exist because market failures exist. It is important to identify and understand those barriers in order to achieve desirable government policy interventions. According to Hirst and Brown (1990), various barriers that prevent the society from successfully closing energy efficiency gap can be divided into two categories: structural barriers and behavioral barriers. Structural barriers result from the actions of public and private organizations, and are usually beyond the control of the individual energy end user. Some examples are presented as following: Distortion in fuel prices. The fuel prices that consumers pay do not reflect the social and environmental costs associated with fuel production, distribution and consumption. Consumers tend not to invest on energy efficiency technologies due to this distortion. Uncertainty about future fuel prices. There have been great uncertainties with the prices for fuels, such as electricity and petroleum. More stringent environmental regulations and global warming concerns also increase the volatility of fuel prices. These uncertainties prevent consumers from making rational purchase decisions of new energy-using systems. Limited access to capital. Consumers often face high up-front costs for energy-efficient systems. In addition, high discount rates are used to make tradeoffs between the initial capital investment and reduced operating costs, which also hinder the investments in energy-efficiency technologies. Government fiscal and regulatory policies. Government policies tend to encourage energy consumption, rather than energy efficiency. For instance, government support has focused more on energy production, and the profit of electric utilities is a function of sales. Codes and standards. The development of codes and standards often lag behind the development of technologies. It also takes a long time to adopt and modify standards, which becomes a barrier for energy efficiency technological innovation. Supply infrastructure limitations. The deployment of energy efficiency technologies is highly restricted by factors such as geography, infrastructure and human resources. Behavioral barriers are problems that characterize the end-user’s decision-marking relating to energy consumption. Four examples are discussed below. Attitudes toward energy efficiency. Public’s awareness of and attitudes toward energy efficiency could greatly affect their energy-related purchase and consumption behaviors. Perceived risk of energy-efficiency investments. Consumers and businesses can be very risk- averse in terms of investing in energy efficiency technologies. The uncertainties of fuel prices and high discount rate for operating costs have both made energy-efficiency investments even more \\"risky” for many decision makers. Information gaps. There is often a lack of information on the performance of energy-efficient technologies. Consumers tend not to change their energy consumption behavior if little information is provided. Misplaced incentives. The principal-agent problem and a lack of life-cycle thinking on costs and savings have imposed barriers for energy conservation. Jaffe and Stavins (1994) categorize the barriers differently. They think that both market failures and non-market failures could account for the limited market success of the cost-effective energy-efficiency technologies. One important source of market failure is imperfect information, for instance the public good attributes of information and information asymmetry. Non-market failure may include the heterogeneity and inertia of consumers, and uncertainty about future energy prices and actual savings from energy efficiency investments.  Measures narrowing the energy efficiency gap  Energy efficiency gap exists in various sectors, ranging from households, small businesses, corporations, and governments.Dietz, T. (2010). Narrowing the US energy efficiency gap. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 107(37), 16007. Many policies and programs have been developed to overcome those barriers and close the energy efficiency gap. ''' Subsidies and incentives for energy-efficient technologies. Insufficient capital investment could be overcome by more aggressive tax subsidies, loan guarantees, and low-interest government loans for energy efficient technologies.Brown, M. A., J. Chandler, et al. (2007). \\"Carbon lock-in: Barriers to deploying climate change mitigation technologies.\\" ORNL/TM-2007/124. Oak Ridge, TN: Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Minimum building and equipment efficiency standards. Minimum building and equipment efficiency standards are cost-effective approaches to save energy. Effective implementation and upgrading of building energy efficiency standards could improve the energy integrity of new buildings, while equipment efficiency standards could help reduce energy consumption and pollution during the life-cycle of equipment. Information programs. Research has proved that providing accurate and trustworthy information on energy use and energy efficiency choices could help narrow the gap.Attari, S. Z., DeKay, M. L., Davidson, C. I., & Bruine de Bruin, W. (2010). Public perceptions of energy consumption and savings. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 107(37). Three forms of information programs can be implemented to help producers and consumers make more informed and rational decisions. The first one is generic information applicable to all energy decision, such as forecasts of future energy pricies; the second type of program is to provide comparative information to facilitate technology and product choices, such as product rating and labeling systems; the third type of program is to offer specific recommendations for producers’ and consumers’ investment choices or behavior changes. Government procurement programs for energy-efficient technologies. Government agencies could be required to procure energy- efficient products. This would help improve the energy efficiency of government sector, and the “learning by doing” impact would create early markets for energy-efficient technologies. Some real-world examples of those measures include the following: EU's energy consumption labeling scheme, U.S. DOE's building energy codes program, and EPA's and DOE's ENERGY STAR® voluntary labeling programs.

The Kingdom of Luba or Luba Empire (1585-1889) was a pre-colonial Central African state that arose in the marshy grasslands of the Upemba Depression in what is now southern Democratic Republic of Congo. Origins and foundation Archaeological research shows that the Upemba depression had been occupied continuously since at least the 4th century AD. In the 4th century, the region was occupied by iron-working farmers. Over the centuries, the people of the region learned to use nets, harpoons, make dugout canoes, and clear canals through swamps. They had also learned techniques for drying fish, which were an important source of protein; they began trading the dried fish with the inhabitants of the protein-starved savanna. By the 6th century, fishing people lived on lakeshores, worked iron, and traded palm oil. By the 10th century, the people of Upemba had diversified their economy, combining fishing, farming and metal-working. Metal-workers relied on traders to bring them the copper and charcoal that they needed in smelting. Traders exported salt and iron items, and imported glass beads and cowry shells from the distant Indian Ocean. By the 14th century, the people of the region were organized into various successful farming and trading communities — the gradual process of the communities merging began. Some communities began to merge into larger, more centralized ones; the reason for this is likely because of competition for increasingly limited resources. The Luba Kingdom was founded by King Kongolo Mwamba around 1585. His nephew and immediate successor, Kalala Ilunga, expanded the empire over the upper left bank territories of the Lualaba River. At its peak, the state had about a million people paying tribute to its king. = Origin myths = According oral tradition, Kongolo Mwamba founded a capital near Lake Boya. From the east, a hunter known as Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe arrived. Ilunga married two sisters of Kongolo — Bulanda and Mabele. Hostility grew between Kongolo and Ilunga, to the point where Ilunga left for an unknown location. Bulanda had a son named Kalala Ilunga — Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe was the father and Kongolo was the uncle. Kalala began to overshadow his uncle. The conflict between the two grew, but turned in Kalala's favour; Kalala eventually seized power and decapitated his uncle. Kalala's reign, the tradition says, initiated an expansionary period for the Kingdom. The new Ilunga dynasty, according to tradition, expanded the Kingdom westward past Lake Kisale. The new dynasty also established a more centralized state, where the king ruled closely with governors. According to the historian Thomas Reefe, the accuracy of the story and the existence of certain figures, like Kolongo, Kalala, and Ilunga, is questionable. Reefe believes that the accounts of Luba's foundation are mythical tales. Luba Empire =Government= The kingdom of Luba's success was due in large part to its development of a form of a government durable enough to withstand the disruptions of succession disputes and flexible enough to incorporate foreign leaders and governments. The Luba model of governing was so successful that it was adopted by the Lunda Kingdom and spread throughout the region that is today northern Angola, northwestern Zambia, and southern Democratic Republic of Congo. Law and order were handled by the king, known as the Mulopwe ('sacred king'), with the assistance of a court of nobles known as Bamfumus. The kings reigned over their subjects through clan kings known as Balopwe. The diverse populations of the Luba were linked by the Bambudye, a secret society that kept the memory of the Luba alive and taught throughout the realm. =Kingship= The Mbudye tradition states that all of the rulers of the Luba Empire traced their ancestry to Kalala Ilunga, a mystical hunter credited with toppling Kongolo Mwamba. This figure is also credited with the introduction of advanced iron forging techniques to the Luba peoples. Luba kings became deities upon their deaths, and the villages from which they ruled were transformed into living shrines devoted to their legacies. The Luba heartland was dotted with these landmarks. Central to Luba regalia for kings and other nobles were mwadi, female incarnations of the ancestral kings. Staffs, headrests, bow stands and royal seats featuring this subject represented the divine status of the ruler and the elegant refinement of his court. =Mbudye= The Luba Kingdom kept official \\"men of memory\\" who were part of a group called the Mbudye. They were responsible for maintaining the oral histories associated with kings, their villages and the customs of the land. Parallels to these kinds of officials can be found in neighboring kingdoms such as Kuba and Lunda. =Economy= The local economy led to the development of several small Luba kingdoms. Luba traders linked the Congolese forest to the north with the mineral-rich region in the center of modern Zambia known as the Copperbelt. The trade routes passing through Luba territory were also connected with wider networks extending to both the Atlantic and Indian Ocean coasts. With the formation of the Luba kingdom, the economy was complex and based on a tribute system that redistributed agricultural, hunting and mining resources among nobles. The ruling class held a virtual monopoly on trade items such as salt, copper, and iron ore. This allowed them to continue their dominance in much of Central Africa. =Arts and beliefs= As in the Kuba Kingdom, the Luba Kingdom held the arts in high esteem. A carver held relatively high status, which was displayed by an adze (axe) that he carried over his shoulder. Luba art was not very uniform because of the vast territory which the kingdom controlled. However, some characteristics are common. The important role of woman in the creation myths and political society resulted in many objects of prestige being decorated with female figures. Headrests and staffs were of great importance in relation to beliefs about prophetic dreams and ancestor worship. Dreams were believed to communicate messages from the other world. Therefore, it was common to have two priestess figures adorned on a headrest on which one slept. Luba staffs, usually owned by kings, village chiefs or court dignitaries, were also carved with dual or paired female figures. Single figures on art pieces, specifically staffs, represented deceased kings whose spirits are carried in a woman’s body. Among the Luba, the name \\"Nkole\\" appears at the head of every genealogy. It is an honorific title, with the literal meaning of \\"the essentially powerful.\\" It was given to the three most distant patriarchs and inserted symbolically in all genealogies. In Baluba tradition, the \\"Kasala\\" is a well-defined form of slogans or free-verse poetry. It is chanted or recited, sometimes with instrumental accompaniment, by both men and women who are professional specialists. It dramatizes public events that call for strong emotions, such as courage in battle, collective joy at official functions, and bereavement at funerals. In both style and content, the kasala by itself is a quite diverse genre along with proverbs, myths, fables, riddles, tales and historical narratives. Influence The prestige attached to the lineage of the sacred kings was enormous, and rulers of small neighboring chiefdoms were eager to associate themselves with Luba culture. In return for tribute in goods and labor, these less powerful rulers were integrated into the royal lineage and adopted the sacred Luba ancestors as their own. Luba courtly traditions, including artistic styles and sculptural forms, were also passed along to client states. Decline Ultimately, long-distance trade destroyed the kingdom of Luba. In the 1870s and 1880s, traders from East Africa began searching for slaves and ivory in the savannahs of central Africa. The empire was raided for slaves beginning the rapid destruction of the Luba Kingdom. In 1889 the empire was split in two by a succession dispute, ending the empire as a unified state. The empire was later absorbed into the Belgian Congo Free State.

Kultrum is indeed a multi-cultural project that taps into the folkloric, ancestral, and traditional sounds of Native American Indians and his South American roots, enhanced by producer Manfred Eicher's Eurocentric notions. The blending of deep drums, rattling percussion, and chanted vocals with the bandoneon or wood flutes creates a vista of deeply spiritual and ancient ritualistic music. Somehow these sounds are magically transmuted and modernized by the pristine sonic tones the ECM production team always lends to their albums, making this a true contemporary world music tour de force.Nastos, M.

Among other duties, SEF is the agency responsible for border control and the issuing of residence permits to foreign nationals legally residing in Portugal. Organisation Headquartered in Lisbon, the SEF is headed by a director general, including central and decentralised services. *Central services: **Administrative Council; **Offices: Asylum and Refugees, Documentation, Communication and Public Relations, Juridical and International Relations and Cooperation; **Central Directorates: Border, Management and Administration, Immigration, Control and Documentary, Information Technology and Research, Research and Information Analysis; **Autonomous departments: Nationality, Operations and Planning and Training. *Decentralised services: **Regional Directorates: Lisbon and Tagus Valley, Alentejo, North, Algarve, Beira, Madeira and Azores; **Delegations, border posts and mixed posts, depending on the regional directorates. The mixed posts, located on the Portuguese-Spanish border, are joint units garrisoned by police officers from Portugal and Spain. History By decree of King Carlos I on August 29, 1893, the Civil Police of Lisbon (Corpo de Polícia Civil de Lisboa) were divided into three sections, one of which was the Administrative Inspection Police, which, among other duties, was responsible for the monitoring of foreigners with Portugal. In 1918, the Emigration Police (Polícia de Emigração) were created through Decree-Law No. 4166 of April 27. The Emigration Police were responsible for the control of the land borders and were a division that worked directly under the General Directorate of Public Safety. In 1928, the Portuguese International Police (Polícia Internacional Portuguesa) were created with the responsibility of monitoring the land borders and foreigners who resided in Portugal. The International Police operated under the Information Police (Polícia de Informações), a body with responsibility for national security, until it was disbanded in 1931. In 1930 the International Police were moved from the command of the Information Police to the command of the Criminal Investigation Police (Polícia de Investigação Criminal) as its International Section. Through Decree No. 20 125 of July 28, 1931, the Portuguese International Police returned to the Ministry of the Interior, remaining under direct control of the Ministry. In 1932, the Political and Social Surveillance Section (Secção de Vigilância Política e Social) of the Portuguese International Police was created, responsible for preventing and combating crimes of a political and social nature. Through Decree No. 22 151 of January 23, 1933, the Political and Social Surveillance Section was transformed into the Political and Social Defense Police (Polícia de Defesa Política e Social), becoming independent of the International Police. By Decree-Law No. 22 992 of August 29, 1933, the Portuguese International Police and the Political and Social Defense Police were once again merged into a single body that became the State Surveillance and Defense Police (Polícia de Vigilância e Defesa do Estado) (PVDE). The PVDE included an International Section which was responsible for verifying the entry, stay and exit of foreigners from the National Territory, their detention if they were deemed undesirable, fighting against espionage, and collaboration with the police of other countries. In 1945, through Decree-Law No. 35 046 of October 22, the PVDE was transformed into the International and State Defense Police (Polícia Internacional e de Defesa do Estado) (PIDE). PIDE was entrusted with administrative functions and functions to prevent and combat crime. As part of its administrative functions, PIDE was responsible for immigration and passport services, land border, sea and air border services and for foreigners' stay and stay service in Portugal. As part of its functions to prevent and combat crime, it was incumbent upon PIDE to prepare preparatory documents for crimes related to the illegal entry and stay of foreigners in Portugal, border protection against criminal activities crimes of illegal emigration, and crimes against the internal and external security of the State. PIDE was disbanded in 1969, by Decree-Law no. 49 401 of November 24, and the General Directorate for Security (Direcção-Geral de Segurança) (DGS) was created in its place. The DGS included the Directorate of Foreigners and Border Services (Direção dos Serviços de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras), the basis of the current service which was created in 1974.

A lemma represents a specific meaning but does not have any specific sounds that are attached to it. When a person produces a word, they are essentially turning their thoughts into sounds, a process known as lexicalisation. In many psycholinguistic models this is considered to be at least a two-stage process. The first stage deals with semantics and syntax; the result of the first stage is an abstract notion of a word that represents a meaning and contains information about how the word can be used in a sentence. It does not, however, contain information about how the word is pronounced. The second stage deals with the phonology of the word; it attaches information about the sounds that will have to be uttered. The result of the first stage is the lemma in this model; the result of the second stage is referred to as the lexeme. This two-staged model is the most widely supported theory of speech production in psycholinguistics, although it has been challenged. For example, there is some evidence to indicate that the grammatical gender of a noun is retrieved from the word's phonological form (the lexeme) rather than from the lemma. This can be explained by models that do not assume a distinct level between the semantic and the phonological stages (and so lack a lemma representation). During the process of language activation, lemma retrieval is the first step in lexical access. In this step, meaning and the syntactic elements of a lexical item are realized as the lemma. Lemma retrieval, as explained through a spreading-activation theory, is part of a network of separate elements consisting of the abstract concept, the lemma and the lexeme. Lemma retrieval is aided by the activation level of the concept that has yet to be verbalized. When activation takes place on the lemma level, the highest activated lemma element is selected. Lexical selection experiments have provided evidence that lemma retrieval is affected by the frequency of the word. This indicates that word frequency not only has an effect on the phonological elements of a word but also the semantic and syntactic elements that make of the lemma. Experiments that have studied the Tip-of-the tongue (TOT) phenomenon have provided evidence that less strong connections of phonological elements (lexemes) and lexical and syntactic representation (lemmas) lead to inability to retrieve a lexical item. TOT utterances provide evidence that the lemmas and lexemes are separate processes in language activation. The concept of lemma is similar to the Sanskrit sphoṭa (6th century), an invariant mental word, to which the sound is intimately – but not indivisibly – connected.

Education Otto received her B.Sc. in 1988 and her Ph.D. in 1992 from Stanford University. She did post-doctoral research with Nick Barton at the University of Edinburgh. Research focus Otto's research focus is a multi-pronged approach of population-genetic mathematical models and statistical tools to understand how evolutionary processes generate diverse biological features. The core of her research revolves around analyzing mathematical models and exploring the insights they yield about how biological systems evolve. Dr. Otto is also the author of the book \\"A Biologist's Guide to Mathematical Modeling in Ecology and Evolution\\".OTTO, SARAH P., and TROY DAY. A Biologist's Guide to Mathematical Modeling in Ecology and Evolution. Princeton University Press, 2007. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvcm4hnd. Through the analysis and development of stochastic models, Dr. Otto's colleagues and herself have shown how genes are transmitted across generations, the context in which genes are expressed, and how evolutionary constraints influence life trait evolution. The second major component of Dr. Otto's research involves the development of statistical tools such as likelihood-based approaches that allow them to infer how particular traits influence speciation and extinction. This allows us to answer questions such as: Do pollinators promote speciation of colorful flowers? Does genome size influence diversification? According to Otto, her research uses \\"mathematical models to clarify how features of an organism affect its potential for and rate of adaptation. She also steps back to address why such features vary in the first place. Why is it that some species produce offspring primarily by cloning themselves, whereas others never do? Why do some species have large genomes with many chromosomes, while others are streamlined?\\" Otto's recent work has investigated the genomic changes that underlie adaptation by yeast to harsh environmental conditions.

Kilmister (3 January 1924 – 2 May 2010) was a British mathematician who specialised in the mathematical foundations of Physics, especially Quantum Mechanics and Relativity and published widely in these fields (see References). He was one of the discoverers of the Combinatorial Hierarchy, along with A. F. Parker-Rhodes, E. W. Bastin, and J.C.Amson. He was strongly influenced by astrophysicist Arthur Eddington and was well known for his elaboration and elucidation of Eddington's Fundamental theory. Kilmister attended Queen Mary College London for both his under- and postgraduate degrees. His 1950 PhD on The Use of Quaternions in Wave-Tensor Calculus related to Eddington's work, and was supervised by cosmologist George C. McVittie, who was one of Eddington's students. His own students included Brian Tupper (1959, King's College London, now professor emeritus of general relativity and cosmology at University of New Brunswick Fredericton ), Samuel Edgar (1977, University of London), and Tony Crilly (reader in mathematical sciences at Middlesex University and author of The Big Questions: Mathematics (1981). Kilmister was elected as a member of the London Mathematical Society during his doctoral studies (17 March 1949). Upon graduation, he began his career as an Assistant Lecturer in the Mathematics Department of King's College in 1950. The entirety of his academic career was spent at King's. In 1954, Kilmister founded the King's Gravitational Theory Group, in concert with Hermann Bondi and Felix Pirani, which focused on Einstein's theory of general relativity.

The lack of access to technology, formal education and skills training have resulted in fewer employment opportunities, and hence contribute to lower revenues of people living in rural areas. =Low levels of education= The low level of education in Brazil in general has been a concern as it perpetuates the income inequality situation by decreasing social mobility. This limits the opportunities of those in low income groups, lowering their chances of narrowing the income gap. Brazil has an illiteracy rate of 10.2% and a poor quality of education. Data from the PISA programme of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) showed that Brazil ranks far behind other nations in terms of learning in various knowledge areas with the majority of their students reaching only lowest learning levels in the disciplines. =Taxation= Brazil's heavy taxes built into consumer prices include high taxes on foods, which burdens the poor. The tax load of those in the higher income brackets earning more than 30 times the minimum wage a month amounted to 26.3 per cent. In contrast, those with a monthly income of less than twice the minimum wage were taxed almost twice the amount at 48.8 per cent. =High land ownership concentration= The expansion of an export- driven agribusiness has led to land ownership concentration (IBGE census reports a GINI index of 0.872). The government implemented an agrarian reform that has resettled many family farms, which employ about 74% of agricultural workers. However, land ownership concentration was reported to be high even in areas where family farms are settled. This is a disturbing issue with regards to income inequality as family farms find it hard to compete with large-scale producers.

Synopsis The book takes a humorous tone and examines the fulfillment of American imperialist manifest destiny at the end of the 19th century as America annexed Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam, and invaded Cuba, and the Philippines in 1898, in an attempt to become a global power. Vowell then tells the story of the culture clash that ensued following Christian missionaries who then moved in swiftly to try to convert the laid back native Hawaiians to the American way. The title comes from a reference of David Malo. Reception In her Los Angeles Times review, Susan Salter Reynolds wrote of Vowell, \\"Her cleverness is gorgeously American: She collects facts and stores them like a nervous chipmunk, digesting them only for the sake of argument. Her curiosity is fueled by indignation. She insists, like a good empiricist, on seeing the people and places she writes about. She is the queen of that great American institution: the road trip.\\" By contrast, Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times is unimpressed, condemning Vowell's self-indulgent style: \\"Certainly at a time when ignorance and historical illiteracy are rampant, there is a place for books that make the past relevant and easy to digest for the casual reader. But Ms. Vowell's determination to render history user-friendly often feels reductive and condescending, and her contemporary analogies can be strained.\\" However, in the New York Times Book Review, Hawaii resident Kaui Hart Hemmings praised the author thus: \\"Vowell deftly summarizes complex events and significant upheavals, reducing them to their essence. ... While Vowell's take on Hawaii's Americanization is abbreviated, it's never bereft of substance—her repartee manages to be filling, her insights astute and comprehensive. It's not surprising to learn that she spent significant time interacting with islanders and combing through journals and archives. A variety of voices are heard, and all sides are implicated in the old Hawaii's demise.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/03/books/review/book-review- unfamiliar-fishes-by-sarah-vowell.html?_r=0 Although Dan Kois, writing for National Public Radio, felt that Vowell was \\"good at connecting the dots in ways that make history vivid for her readers,\\" he found the book \\"glib\\" and the subject \\"so complicated that her anecdotal structure isn't quite up to the task.\\" He also cited \\"the limitations of Vowell's arch style.\\"https://www.npr.org/2011/07/14/134738707/unfamiliar-fishes-sarah- vowells-glib-luau-tales Audiobook An unabridged audiobook was released by Simon & Schuster on March 22, 2011.

Background After the early 1984 Top 10 UK hit with \\"(Feels Like) Heaven\\", the follow-up, a reissue of debut single \\"Ghost of Love\\", only managed to reach No. 64 in the UK. The band became labelled as a one-hit wonder, as their following releases failed to reach commercial success. \\"All or Nothing\\" was released with little interest from record buyers, and it failed to make an appearance within the UK Top 100. This was despite the song receiving acclaim from music journalists as a stand- out track from the band's debut album. The song was released with limited promotion, with the single not having a music video, unlike the previous two singles. Release The single was released via 7\\" and 12\\" vinyl in the UK. A 7\\" single was also issued in the Netherlands. All releases were through CBS Records, who also distributed the release. A promotional 7\\" vinyl was released in the UK as well.

This song was also written by Patterson and Jordan, and produced by Fiction Factory. Peter Wilson, who produced the majority of the band's debut album, mixed the track. The single featured a full colour sleeve, featuring similar artwork as the band's debut album - a close up of Patterson in silhouette, with a glowing effect amongst a black backdrop. The photography was taken by David McIntyre in his own parent's garden. The effect was achieved by McIntyre drawing Patterson's outline on a piece of cardboard. A couple of days later they then took a camera, the exposure and the cardboard outline to a local place called \\"The Hermitage\\" - close to Perth - where Europe's tallest tree stands. The cardboard piece was positioned close to the tree, and then McIntyre did the second part of the exposure while walking about with a torch doing all the lights off Patterson.

The peer review helps the publisher (that is, the editor-in-chief, the editorial board or the program committee) decide whether the work should be accepted, considered acceptable with revisions, or rejected. Pragmatically, peer review refers to the work done during the screening of submitted manuscripts. This process encourages authors to meet the accepted standards of their discipline and reduces the dissemination of irrelevant findings, unwarranted claims, unacceptable interpretations, and personal views. Publications that have not undergone peer review are likely to be regarded with suspicion by academic scholars and professionals. Non-peer-reviewed work does not contribute, or contributes less, to the academic credit of scholar such as the h-index, although this heavily depends on the field. Peer review requires a community of experts in a given (and often narrowly defined) field, who are qualified and able to perform reasonably impartial review. Impartial review, especially of work in less narrowly defined or inter-disciplinary fields, may be difficult to accomplish, and the significance (good or bad) of an idea may never be widely appreciated among its contemporaries. Peer review is generally considered necessary to academic quality and is used in most major scholarly journals. Additionally, since reviewers are typically familiar with recent publications in the area, they are in a good position to detect plagiarism. However, peer review does not prevent publication of invalid research, and there is little evidence that peer review improves the quality of published papers. There are attempts to reform the peer review process, including from the fields of metascience and journalology. Reformers seek to increase the reliability and efficiency of the peer review process and to provide it with a scientific foundation. Alternatives to common peer review practices have been put to the test, in particular open peer review, where the comments are visible to readers, generally with the identities of the peer reviewers disclosed as well, e.g., F1000, eLife, BMJ, and BioMed Central. History The first record of an editorial pre-publication peer-review is from 1665 by Henry Oldenburg, the founding editor of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society at the Royal Society of London.Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy, National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine On Being a Scientist: A Guide to Responsible Conduct in Research National Academies Press, Washington, D.C., 1995,82 pages, The Origin of the Scientific Journal and the Process of Peer Review House of Commons Select Committee Report The first peer-reviewed publication might have been the Medical Essays and Observations published by the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1731. The present-day peer-review system evolved from this 18th-century process, began to involve external reviewers in the mid-19th-century, and did not become commonplace until the mid-20th- century. Peer review became a touchstone of the scientific method, but until the end of the 19th century was often performed directly by an editor-in-chief or editorial committee. Editors of scientific journals at that time made publication decisions without seeking outside input, i.e. an external panel of reviewers, giving established authors latitude in their journalistic discretion. For example, Albert Einstein's four revolutionary Annus Mirabilis papers in the 1905 issue of Annalen der Physik were peer-reviewed by the journal's editor-in-chief, Max Planck, and its co-editor, Wilhelm Wien, both future Nobel prize winners and together experts on the topics of these papers. On a much later occasion, Einstein was severely critical of the external review process, saying that he had not authorized the editor in chief to show his manuscript \\"to specialists before it is printed\\", and informing him that he would \\"publish the paper elsewhere\\"--which he did, and in fact he later had to withdraw the publication. While some medical journals started to systematically appoint external reviewers, it is only since the middle of the 20th century that this practice has spread widely and that external reviewers have been given some visibility within academic journals, including being thanked by authors and editors. A 2003 editorial in Nature stated that, in the early 20th century, \\"the burden of proof was generally on the opponents rather than the proponents of new ideas.\\" Nature itself instituted formal peer review only in 1967. Journals such as Science and the American Journal of Medicine increasingly relied on external reviewers in the 1950s and 1960s, in part to reduce the editorial workload. In the 20th century, peer review also became common for science funding allocations. This process appears to have developed independently from that of editorial peer review. Gaudet provides a social science view of the history of peer review carefully tending to what is under investigation, here peer review, and not only looking at superficial or self- evident commonalities among inquisition, censorship, and journal peer review. It builds on historical research by Gould, Biagioli, Spier, and Rip. The first Peer Review Congress met in 1989. Over time, the fraction of papers devoted to peer review has steadily declined, suggesting that as a field of sociological study, it has been replaced by more systematic studies of bias and errors. In parallel with \\"common experience\\" definitions based on the study of peer review as a \\"pre-constructed process\\", some social scientists have looked at peer review without considering it as pre-constructed. Hirschauer proposed that journal peer review can be understood as reciprocal accountability of judgements among peers. Gaudet proposed that journal peer review could be understood as a social form of boundary judgement – determining what can be considered as scientific (or not) set against an overarching knowledge system, and following predecessor forms of inquisition and censorship. Justification It is difficult for authors and researchers, whether individually or in a team, to spot every mistake or flaw in a complicated piece of work. This is not necessarily a reflection on those concerned, but because with a new and perhaps eclectic subject, an opportunity for improvement may be more obvious to someone with special expertise or who simply looks at it with a fresh eye. Therefore, showing work to others increases the probability that weaknesses will be identified and improved. For both grant-funding and publication in a scholarly journal, it is also normally a requirement that the subject is both novel and substantial. The decision whether or not to publish a scholarly article, or what should be modified before publication, ultimately lies with the publisher (editor-in-chief or the editorial board) to which the manuscript has been submitted. Similarly, the decision whether or not to fund a proposed project rests with an official of the funding agency. These individuals usually refer to the opinion of one or more reviewers in making their decision. This is primarily for three reasons: * Workload. A small group of editors/assessors cannot devote sufficient time to each of the many articles submitted to many journals. * Miscellany of ideas. Were the editor/assessor to judge all submitted material themselves, approved material would solely reflect their opinion. * Limited expertise. An editor/assessor cannot be expected to be sufficiently expert in all areas covered by a single journal or funding agency to adequately judge all submitted material. Reviewers are often anonymous and independent. However, some reviewers may choose to waive their anonymity, and in other limited circumstances, such as the examination of a formal complaint against the referee, or a court order, the reviewer's identity may have to be disclosed. Anonymity may be unilateral or reciprocal (single- or double-blinded reviewing). Since reviewers are normally selected from experts in the fields discussed in the article, the process of peer review helps to keep some invalid or unsubstantiated claims out of the body of published research and knowledge. Scholars will read published articles outside their limited area of detailed expertise, and then rely, to some degree, on the peer-review process to have provided reliable and credible research that they can build upon for subsequent or related research. Significant scandal ensues when an author is found to have falsified the research included in an article, as other scholars, and the field of study itself, may have relied upon the invalid research. For US universities, peer reviewing of books before publication is a requirement for full membership of the Association of American University Presses. Procedure In the case of proposed publications, the publisher (editor-in-chief or the editorial board, often with assistance of corresponding or associate editors) sends advance copies of an author's work or ideas to researchers or scholars who are experts in the field (known as \\"referees\\" or \\"reviewers\\"). Communication is normally by e-mail or through a web-based manuscript processing system such as ScholarOne, Scholastica, or Open Journal Systems. Depending on the field of study and on the specific journal, there are usually one to three referees for a given article. For example, Springer states that there are two or three reviewers per article. The peer-review process involves three steps: Step 1: Desk evaluation. An editor evaluates the manuscript to judge whether the paper will be passed on journal referees. At this phase many articles receive a “desk reject,” that is, the editor chooses not to pass along the article. The authors may or may not receive a letter of explanation. Desk rejection is intended to be a streamlined process so that editors may move past nonviable manuscripts quickly and provide authors with the opportunity to pursue a more suitable journal. For example, the European Accounting Review editors subject each manuscript to three questions to decide whether a manuscript moves forward to referees: 1) Is the article a fit for the journal's aims and scope, 2) is the paper content (e.g. literature review, methods, conclusions) sufficient and does the paper make a worthwhile contribution to the larger body of literature, and 3) does it follow format and technical specifications? If “no” to any of these, the manuscript receives a desk rejection. Desk rejection rates vary by journal. For example, in 2017 researchers at the World Bank compiled rejection rates of several global economics journals; the desk rejection rate ranged from 21% (Economic Lacea) to 66% (Journal of Development Economics). The American Psychological Association publishes rejection rates for several major publications in the field, and although they do not specify whether the rejection is pre- or post- desk evaluation, their figures in 2016 ranged from a low of 49% to a high of 90%. Step 2: Blind review. If the paper is not desk rejected, the editors send the manuscript to the referees, who are chosen for their expertise and distance from the authors. At this point, referees may reject, accept without changes (rare) or instruct the authors to revise and resubmit. Reasons vary for acceptance of an article by editors, but Elsevier published an article where three editors weigh in on factors that drive article acceptance. These factors include whether the manuscript: delivers “new insight into an important issue,” will be useful to practitioners, advances or proposes a new theory, raises new questions, has appropriate methods and conclusion, presents a good argument based on the literature, and tells a good story. One editor notes that he likes papers that he “wished he’d done” himself. These referees each return an evaluation of the work to the editor, noting weaknesses or problems along with suggestions for improvement. Typically, most of the referees' comments are eventually seen by the author, though a referee can also send 'for your eyes only' comments to the publisher; scientific journals observe this convention almost universally. The editor then evaluates the referees' comments, her or his own opinion of the manuscript before passing a decision back to the author(s), usually with the referees' comments. Referees' evaluations usually include an explicit recommendation of what to do with the manuscript or proposal, often chosen from options provided by the journal or funding agency. For example, Nature recommends four courses of action: * to unconditionally accept the manuscript or the proposal, * to accept it in the event that its authors improve it in certain ways * to reject it, but encourage revision and invite re-submission * to reject it outright. During this process, the role of the referees is advisory. The editor(s) is typically under no obligation to accept the opinions of the referees, though he or she will most often do so. Furthermore, the referees in scientific publication do not act as a group, do not communicate with each other, and typically are not aware of each other's identities or evaluations. Proponents argue that if the reviewers of a paper are unknown to each other, the editor(s) can more easily verify the objectivity of the reviews. There is usually no requirement that the referees achieve consensus, with the decision instead often made by the editor(s) based on her best judgement of the arguments. In situations where multiple referees disagree substantially about the quality of a work, there are a number of strategies for reaching a decision. The paper may be rejected outright, or the editor may choose which reviewer's point the authors should address. When a publisher receives very positive and very negative reviews for the same manuscript, the editor will often solicit one or more additional reviews as a tie-breaker. As another strategy in the case of ties, the publisher may invite authors to reply to a referee's criticisms and permit a compelling rebuttal to break the tie. If a publisher does not feel confident to weigh the persuasiveness of a rebuttal, the publisher may solicit a response from the referee who made the original criticism. An editor may convey communications back and forth between authors and a referee, in effect allowing them to debate a point. Even in these cases, however, publishers do not allow multiple referees to confer with each other, though each reviewer may often see earlier comments submitted by other reviewers. The goal of the process is explicitly not to reach consensus or to persuade anyone to change their opinions, but instead to provide material for an informed editorial decision. One early study regarding referee disagreement found that agreement was greater than chance, if not much greater than chance, on six of seven article attributes (e.g. literature review and final recommendation to publish), but this study was small and it was conducted on only one journal. At least one study has found that reviewer disagreement is not common, but this study is also small and on only one journal. Traditionally, reviewers would often remain anonymous to the authors, but this standard varies both with time and with academic field. In some academic fields, most journals offer the reviewer the option of remaining anonymous or not, or a referee may opt to sign a review, thereby relinquishing anonymity. Published papers sometimes contain, in the acknowledgments section, thanks to anonymous or named referees who helped improve the paper. For example, Nature journals provide this option. Sometimes authors may exclude certain reviewers: one study conducted on the Journal of Investigative Dermatology found that excluding reviewers doubled the chances of article acceptance. Some scholars are uncomfortable with this idea, arguing that it distorts the scientific process. Others argue that it protects against referees who are biased in some manner (e.g. professional rivalry, grudges). In some cases, authors can choose referees for their manuscripts. mSphere, an open-access journal in microbial science, has moved to this model. Editor-in- Chief Mike Imperiale says this process is designed to reduce the time it takes to review papers and permit the authors to choose the most appropriate reviewers. But a scandal in 2015 shows how this choosing reviewers can encourage fraudulent reviews. Fake reviews were submitted to the Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System in the names of author-recommended reviewers, causing the journal to eliminate this option. Step 3: Revisions. If the manuscript has not been rejected during peer review, it returns to the authors for revisions. During this phase, the authors address the concerns raised by reviewers. Dr. William Stafford Noble offers ten rules for responding to reviewers. His rules include: # \\"Provide an overview, then quote the full set of reviews” # “Be polite and respectful of all reviewers” # “Accept the blame” # “Make the response self-contained” # “Respond to every point raised by the reviewer” # “Use typography to help the reviewer navigate your response” # “Whenever possible, begin your response to each comment with a direct answer to the point being raised” # “When possible, do what the reviewer asks” # “Be clear about what changed relative to the previous version” # “If necessary, write the response twice” (i.e. write a version for “venting” but then write a version the reviewers will see) Recruiting referees At a journal or book publisher, the task of picking reviewers typically falls to an editor. When a manuscript arrives, an editor solicits reviews from scholars or other experts who may or may not have already expressed a willingness to referee for that journal or book division. Granting agencies typically recruit a panel or committee of reviewers in advance of the arrival of applications. Referees are supposed to inform the editor of any conflict of interests that might arise. Journals or individual editors may invite a manuscript's authors to name people whom they consider qualified to referee their work. For some journals this is a requirement of submission. Authors are sometimes also given the opportunity to name natural candidates who should be disqualified, in which case they may be asked to provide justification (typically expressed in terms of conflict of interest). Editors solicit author input in selecting referees because academic writing typically is very specialized. Editors often oversee many specialties, and can not be experts in all of them. But after an editor selects referees from the pool of candidates, the editor typically is obliged not to disclose the referees' identities to the authors, and in scientific journals, to each other. Policies on such matters differ among academic disciplines. One difficulty with respect to some manuscripts is that, there may be few scholars who truly qualify as experts, people who have themselves done work similar to that under review. This can frustrate the goals of reviewer anonymity and avoidance of conflicts of interest. Low-prestige or local journals and granting agencies that award little money are especially handicapped with regard to recruiting experts. A potential hindrance in recruiting referees is that they are usually not paid, largely because doing so would itself create a conflict of interest. Also, reviewing takes time away from their main activities, such as his or her own research. To the would-be recruiter's advantage, most potential referees are authors themselves, or at least readers, who know that the publication system requires that experts donate their time. Serving as a referee can even be a condition of a grant, or professional association membership. Referees have the opportunity to prevent work that does not meet the standards of the field from being published, which is a position of some responsibility. Editors are at a special advantage in recruiting a scholar when they have overseen the publication of his or her work, or if the scholar is one who hopes to submit manuscripts to that editor's publishing entity in the future. Granting agencies, similarly, tend to seek referees among their present or former grantees. Peerage of Science is an independent service and a community where reviewer recruitment happens via Open Engagement: authors submit their manuscript to the service where it is made accessible for any non-affiliated scientist, and 'validated users' choose themselves what they want to review. The motivation to participate as a peer reviewer comes from a reputation system where the quality of the reviewing work is judged and scored by other users, and contributes to user profiles. Peerage of Science does not charge any fees to scientists, and does not pay peer reviewers. Participating publishers however pay to use the service, gaining access to all ongoing processes and the opportunity to make publishing offers to the authors. With independent peer review services the author usually retains the right to the work throughout the peer review process, and may choose the most appropriate journal to submit the work to. Peer review services may also provide advice or recommendations on most suitable journals for the work. Journals may still want to perform an independent peer review, without the potential conflict of interest that financial reimbursement may cause, or the risk that an author has contracted multiple peer review services but only presents the most favorable one. An alternative or complementary system of performing peer review is for the author to pay for having it performed. Example of such service provider is Rubriq, which for each work assigns peer reviewers who are financially compensated for their efforts. Different styles =Anonymous and attributed= For most scholarly publications, the identity of the reviewers is kept anonymised (also called \\"blind peer review\\"). The alternative, attributed peer review involves revealing the identities of the reviewers. Some reviewers choose to waive their right to anonymity, even when the journal's default format is blind peer review. In anonymous peer review, reviewers are known to the journal editor or conference organiser but their names are not given to the article's author. In some cases, the author's identity can also be anonymised for the review process, with identifying information is stripped from the document before review. The system is intended to reduce or eliminate bias. Some experts proposed blind review procedures for reviewing controversial research topics. In double-blind peer review, which has been fashioned by sociology journals in the 1950s and remains more common in the social sciences and humanities than in the natural sciences, the identity of the authors is concealed from the reviewers (\\"blinded\\"), and vice versa, lest the knowledge of authorship or concern about disapprobation from the author bias their review. Critics of the double-blind review process point out that, despite any editorial effort to ensure anonymity, the process often fails to do so, since certain approaches, methods, writing styles, notations, etc., point to a certain group of people in a research stream, and even to a particular person. In many fields of \\"big science\\", the publicly available operation schedules of major equipments, such as telescopes or synchrotrons, would make the authors' names obvious to anyone who would care to look them up. Proponents of double-blind review argue that it performs no worse than single-blind, and that it generates a perception of fairness and equality in academic funding and publishing. Single-blind review is strongly dependent upon the goodwill of the participants, but no more so than double-blind review with easily identified authors. As an alternative to single-blind and double-blind review, authors and reviewers are encouraged to declare their conflicts of interest when the names of authors and sometimes reviewers are known to the other. When conflicts are reported, the conflicting reviewer can be prohibited from reviewing and discussing the manuscript, or his or her review can instead be interpreted with the reported conflict in mind; the latter option is more often adopted when the conflict of interest is mild, such as a previous professional connection or a distant family relation. The incentive for reviewers to declare their conflicts of interest is a matter of professional ethics and individual integrity. Even when the reviews are not public, they are still a matter of record and the reviewer's credibility depends upon how they represent themselves among their peers. Some software engineering journals, such as the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, use non-blind reviews with reporting to editors of conflicts of interest by both authors and reviewers. A more rigorous standard of accountability is known as an audit. Because reviewers are not paid, they cannot be expected to put as much time and effort into a review as an audit requires. Therefore, academic journals such as Science, organizations such as the American Geophysical Union, and agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation maintain and archive scientific data and methods in the event another researcher wishes to replicate or audit the research after publication. * This policy was first adopted by the AGU Publications Committee in November 1993 and then revised March 1994, December 1995, October 1996. * See also AGU Data Policy by Bill Cook. April 4, 2012. The traditional anonymous peer review has been criticized for its lack of accountability, the possibility of abuse by reviewers or by those who manage the peer review process (that is, journal editors), its possible bias, and its inconsistency, alongside other flaws. Eugene Koonin, a senior investigator at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, asserts that the system has \\"well-known ills\\" and advocates \\"open peer review\\". =Open peer review= In 1999, the open access journal Journal of Medical Internet Research was launched, which from its inception decided to publish the names of the reviewers at the bottom of each published article. Also in 1999, the British Medical Journal moved to an open peer review system, revealing reviewers' identities to the authors but not the readers, and in 2000, the medical journals in the open access BMC series published by BioMed Central, launched using open peer review. As with the BMJ, the reviewers' names are included on the peer review reports. In addition, if the article is published the reports are made available online as part of the \\"pre-publication history\\"'. Several other journals published by the BMJ Group allow optional open peer review, as does PLoS Medicine, published by the Public Library of Science. The BMJ's Rapid Responses allows ongoing debate and criticism following publication. In June 2006, Nature launched an experiment in parallel open peer review: some articles that had been submitted to the regular anonymous process were also available online for open, identified public comment. The results were less than encouraging – only 5% of authors agreed to participate in the experiment, and only 54% of those articles received comments. The editors have suggested that researchers may have been too busy to take part and were reluctant to make their names public. The knowledge that articles were simultaneously being subjected to anonymous peer review may also have affected the uptake. In February 2006, the journal Biology Direct was launched by BioMed Central, adding another alternative to the traditional model of peer review. If authors can find three members of the Editorial Board who will each return a report or will themselves solicit an external review, the article will be published. As with Philica, reviewers cannot suppress publication, but in contrast to Philica, no reviews are anonymous and no article is published without being reviewed. Authors have the opportunity to withdraw their article, to revise it in response to the reviews, or to publish it without revision. If the authors proceed with publication of their article despite critical comments, readers can clearly see any negative comments along with the names of the reviewers. In the social sciences, there have been experiments with wiki-style, signed peer reviews, for example in an issue of the Shakespeare Quarterly. In 2010, the British Medical Journal began publishing signed reviewer's reports alongside accepted papers, after determining that telling reviewers that their signed reviews might be posted publicly did not significantly affect the quality of the reviews. In 2011, Peerage of Science, and independent peer review service, was launched with several non-traditional approaches to academic peer review. Most prominently, these include the judging and scoring of the accuracy and justifiability of peer reviews, and concurrent usage of a single peer review round by several participating journals. Starting in 2013 with the launch of F1000Research, some publishers have combined open peer review with postpublication peer review by using a versioned article system. At F1000Research, articles are published before review, and invited peer review reports (and reviewer names) are published with the article as they come in. Author-revised versions of the article are then linked to the original. A similar postpublication review system with versioned articles is used by Science Open launched in 2014. In 2014, Life implanted an open peer review system, under which the peer-review reports and authors’ responses are published as an integral part of the final version of each article. Since 2016, Synlett is experimenting with closed crowd peer review. The article under review is sent to a pool of 80+ expert reviewers who then collaboratively comment on the manuscript. In an effort to address issues with the reproducibility of research results, some scholars are asking that authors agree to share their raw data as part of the peer review process. As far back as 1962, for example, a number of psychologists have attempted to obtain raw data sets from other researchers, with mixed results, in order to reanalyze them. A recent attempt resulted in only seven data sets out of fifty requests. The notion of obtaining, let alone requiring, open data as a condition of peer review remains controversial. In 2020 peer review lack of access to raw data lead to article retractions in prestigious New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet. Many journals now require access to raw data to be included in peer review.Covid-19 studies based on flawed Surgisphere data force medical journals to review processes The Guardian, 2020 =Pre- and post-publication peer review = The process of peer review is not restricted to the publication process managed by academic journals. In particular, some forms of peer review can occur before an article is submitted to a journal and/or after it is published by the journal.  Pre-publication peer review  Manuscripts are typically reviewed by colleagues before submission, and if the manuscript is uploaded to preprint servers, such as ArXiv, BioRxiv or SSRN, researchers can read and comment on the manuscript. The practice to upload to preprint servers, and the activity of discussion heavily depend on the field, and it allows an open pre-publication peer review. The advantage of this method is speed and transparency of the review process. Anyone can give feedback, typically in form of comments, and typically not anonymously. These comments are also public, and can be responded to, therefore author-reviewer communication is not restricted to the typical 2–4 rounds of exchanges in traditional publishing. The authors from can incorporate comments from a wide range of people instead of feedback from the typically 3–4 reviewers. The disadvantage is that a far larger number of papers are presented to the community without any guarantee on quality.  Post-publication peer review  After a manuscript is published, the process of peer review continues as publications are read, known as post-publication peer review. Readers will often send letters to the editor of a journal, or correspond with the editor via an on-line journal club. In this way, all \\"peers\\" may offer review and critique of published literature. The introduction of the \\"epub ahead of print\\" practice in many journals has made possible the simultaneous publication of unsolicited letters to the editor together with the original paper in the print issue. A variation on this theme is open peer commentary, in which commentaries from specialists are solicited on published articles and the authors are invited to respond. Journals using this process solicit and publish non-anonymous commentaries on the \\"target paper\\" together with the paper, and with original authors' reply as a matter of course. Open peer commentary was first implemented by the anthropologist Sol Tax, who founded the journal Current Anthropology in 1957. The journal Behavioral and Brain Sciences, published by Cambridge University Press, was founded by Stevan Harnad in 1978 and modeled on Current Anthropology's open peer commentary feature.New Scientist, 20 March 1980, p. 945 Psycoloquy (1990–2002) was based on the same feature, but this time implemented online. Since 2016 open peer commentary is also provided by the journal Animal Sentience. In addition to journals hosting their own articles' reviews, there are also external, independent websites dedicated to post-publication peer-review, such as PubPeer which allows anonymous commenting of published literature and pushes authors to answer these comments. It has been suggested that post-publication reviews from these sites should be editorially considered as well. The megajournals F1000Research and ScienceOpen publish openly both the identity of the reviewers and the reviewer's report alongside the article. Some journals use postpublication peer review as formal review method, instead of prepublication review. This was first introduced in 2001, by Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP). More recently F1000Research and ScienceOpen were launched as megajournals with postpublication review as formal review method. At both ACP and F1000Research peer reviewers are formally invited, much like at prepublication review journals. Articles that pass peer review at those two journals are included in external scholarly databases. In 2006, a small group of UK academic psychologists launched Philica, the instant online journal Journal of Everything, to redress many of what they saw as the problems of traditional peer review. All submitted articles are published immediately and may be reviewed afterwards. Any researcher who wishes to review an article can do so and reviews are anonymous. Reviews are displayed at the end of each article, and are used to give the reader criticism or guidance about the work, rather than to decide whether it is published or not. This means that reviewers cannot suppress ideas if they disagree with them. Readers use reviews to guide their reading, and particularly popular or unpopular work is easy to identify.  Social media and informal peer review  Recent research has called attention to the use of social media technologies and science blogs as a means of informal, post-publication peer review, as in the case of the #arseniclife (or GFAJ-1) controversy. In December 2010, an article published in Scienceexpress (the ahead-of-print version of Science) generated both excitement and skepticism, as its authors—led by NASA astrobiologist Felisa Wolfe-Simon—claimed to have discovered and cultured a certain bacteria that could replace phosphorus with arsenic in its physiological building blocks. At the time of the article's publication, NASA issued press statements suggesting that the finding would impact the search for extraterrestrial life, sparking excitement on Twitter under the hashtag #arseniclife, as well as criticism from fellow experts who voiced skepticism via their personal blogs.Redfield, Rosemary (4 December 2010). \\"Arsenic-associated bacteria (NASA's claims)\\". RR Research blog]. Retrieved 4 December 2010. Ultimately, the controversy surrounding the article attracted media attention,Zimmer, Carl (7 December 2010). \\"Scientists see fatal flaws in the NASA study of arsenic- based life\\". Slate. Retrieved 7 December 2010. and one of the most vocal scientific critics—Rosemary Redfield—formally published in July 2012 regarding her and her colleagues' unsuccessful attempt to replicate the NASA scientists’ original findings. Researchers following the impact of the #arseniclife case on social media discussions and peer review processes concluded the following: > Our results indicate that interactive online communication technologies can > enable members in the broader scientific community to perform the role of > journal reviewers to legitimize scientific information after it has advanced > through formal review channels.

(p 946) = Result-blind peer review = Studies which report a positive or statistically-significant result are far more likely to be published than ones which do not. A counter-measure to this positivity bias is to hide or make unavailable the results, making journal acceptance more like scientific grant agencies reviewing research proposals. Versions include: # Result-blind peer review or results blind peer review, first proposed 1966: Reviewers receive an edited version of the submitted paper which omits the results and conclusion section.

Only once the proposed hypothesis and methodology have been accepted by reviewers, the authors would collect the data or analyze previously collected data. A limited variant of a pre-accepted article was The Lancet's study protocol review from 1997–2015 reviewed and published randomized trial protocols with a guarantee that the eventual paper would at least be sent out to peer review rather than immediately rejected.\\"Read it, understand it, believe it, use it: Principles and proposals for a more credible research publication\\", Green et al 2013, citing \\"Protocol Review\\" For example, Nature Human Behaviour has adopted the registered report format, as it “shift[s] the emphasis from the results of research to the questions that guide the research and the methods used to answer them”. The European Journal of Personality defines this format: “In a registered report, authors create a study proposal that includes theoretical and empirical background, research questions/hypotheses, and pilot data (if available). Upon submission, this proposal will then be reviewed prior to data collection, and if accepted, the paper resulting from this peer-reviewed procedure will be published, regardless of the study outcomes.” The following journals used result-blind peer review or pre-accepted articles: * The European Journal of Parapsychology, under Martin Johnson (who proposed a version of Registered Reports in 1974)EJP editorial, Johnson 1975 (European Journal of Parapsychology. 1975;1(1):1-2); \\"Models of control and control of bias\\", Johnson 1975 (European Journal of Parapsychology. 1975;1(1):36–44); \\"On Publication Policy Regarding Non-Significant Results\\", Johnson 1976 (European Journal of Parapsychology 1976;1(2):1–5), began accepting papers based on submitted designs and then publishing them, from 1976 to 1993, and published 25 RRs total * The International Journal of Forecasting used opt-in result- blind peer review and pre-accepted articles from before 1986 through 1996/1997. * The journal Applied Psychological Measurement offered an opt-in \\"advance publication review\\" process from 1989–1996, ending use after only 5 papers were submitted. * The JAMA Internal Medicine found in a 2009 survey that 86% of its reviewers would be willing to work in a result-blind peer review process, and ran a pilot experiment with a two-stage result-blind peer review, showing the unblinded step benefited positive studies more than negatives. but the journal does not currently use result-blind peer review. * The Center for Open Science encourages using \\"Registered Reports\\" (pre- accepted articles)\\"Registered Reports\\", OSF\\"Registered Reports: A step change in scientific publishing; Professor Chris Chambers, Registered Reports Editor of the Elsevier journal Cortex and one of the concept's founders, on how the initiative combats publication bias\\", Chambers, 13 November 2014\\"Register your study as a new publication option\\", Science, 15 December 2015\\"Psychology's 'registration revolution': Moves to uphold transparency are not only making psychology more scientific - they are harnessing our knowledge of the mind to strengthen science\\", Guardian, 20 May 2014 beginning in 2013. As of October 2017, ~80 journals offer Registered Reports in general, have had special issues of Registered Reports, or limited acceptance of Registered Reports (e.g. replications only) including AIMS Neuroscience, Cortex, Perspectives on Psychological Science, Social Psychology, & Comparative Political Studies ** Comparative Political Studies published results of its pilot experiment of 19 submissions of which 3 were pre-accepted in 2016. the process worked well but submissions were weighted towards quantitative experimental designs, and reduced the amount of 'fishing' as submitters and reviewers focused on theoretical backing, substantive importance of results, with attention to the statistical power and implications of a null result, concluding that \\"we can clearly state that this form of review lead to papers that were of the highest quality. We would love to see a top journal adopt results-free review as a policy, at very least allowing results-free review as one among several standard submission options.\\"  Criticism  Various editors have expressed criticism of peer review. In addition, a Cochrane review found little empirical evidence that peer review ensures quality in biomedical research, while a second systematic review and meta-analysis found a need for evidence- based peer review in biomedicine given the paucity of assessment of the interventions designed to improve the process. =Allegations of bias and suppression= The interposition of editors and reviewers between authors and readers may enable the intermediators to act as gatekeepers. Some sociologists of science argue that peer review makes the ability to publish susceptible to control by elites and to personal jealousy.\\"British scientists exclude 'maverick' colleagues, says report\\" (2004) EurekAlert Public release date: August 16, 2004 The peer review process may sometimes impede progress and may be biased against novelty. A linguistic analysis of review reports suggests that reviewers focus on rejecting the applications by searching for weak points, and not on finding the high-risk/high-gain groundbreaking ideas that may be in the proposal. Reviewers tend to be especially critical of conclusions that contradict their own views, and lenient towards those that match them. At the same time, established scientists are more likely than others to be sought out as referees, particularly by high-prestige journals/publishers. There are also signs of gender bias, favouring men as authors. As a result, ideas that harmonize with the established experts' are more likely to see print and to appear in premier journals than are iconoclastic or revolutionary ones. This accords with Thomas Kuhn's well-known observations regarding scientific revolutions. A theoretical model has been established whose simulations imply that peer review and over-competitive research funding foster mainstream opinion to monopoly. Criticisms of traditional anonymous peer review allege that it lacks accountability, can lead to abuse by reviewers, and may be biased and inconsistent. = Open access journals and peer review = Some critics of open access (OA) journals have argued that, compared to traditional subscription journals, open access journals might utilize substandard or less formal peer review practices, and, as a consequence, the quality of scientific work in such journals will suffer. In a study published in 2012, this hypothesis was tested by evaluating the relative \\"impact\\" (using citation counts) of articles published in open access and subscription journals, on the grounds that members of the scientific community would presumably be less likely to cite substandard work, and that citation counts could therefore act as one indicator of whether or not the journal format indeed impacted peer review and the quality of published scholarship. This study ultimately concluded that \\"OA journals indexed in Web of Science and/or Scopus are approaching the same scientific impact and quality as subscription journals, particularly in biomedicine and for journals funded by article processing charges,\\" and the authors consequently argue that \\"there is no reason for authors not to choose to publish in OA journals just because of the ‘OA’ label. =Failures= Peer review fails when a peer- reviewed article contains fundamental errors that undermine at least one of its main conclusions and that could have been identified by more careful reviewers. Many journals have no procedure to deal with peer review failures beyond publishing letters to the editor. Peer review in scientific journals assumes that the article reviewed has been honestly prepared. The process occasionally detects fraud, but is not designed to do so. When peer review fails and a paper is published with fraudulent or otherwise irreproducible data, the paper may be retracted. A 1998 experiment on peer review with a fictitious manuscript found that peer reviewers failed to detect some manuscript errors and the majority of reviewers may not notice that the conclusions of the paper are unsupported by its results.  Fake peer review  There have been instances where peer review was claimed to be performed but in fact was not; this has been documented in some predatory open access journals (e.g., the Who's Afraid of Peer Review? affair) or in the case of sponsored Elsevier journals.A case of peer review fraud in Tumor Biology papers (Retrieved April 25, 2017) In November 2014, an article in Nature exposed that some academics were submitting fake contact details for recommended reviewers to journals, so that if the publisher contacted the recommended reviewer, they were the original author reviewing their own work under a fake name. The Committee on Publication Ethics issued a statement warning of the fraudulent practice. In March 2015, BioMed Central retracted 43 articles and Springer retracted 64 papers in 10 journals in August 2015. Tumor Biology journal is another example of peer review fraud. Examples * \\"Perhaps the most widely recognized failure of peer review is its inability to ensure the identification of high-quality work. The list of important scientific papers that were rejected by some peer-reviewed journals goes back at least as far as the editor of Philosophical Transaction's 1796 rejection of Edward Jenner's report of the first vaccination against smallpox.\\" * The Soon and Baliunas controversy involved the publication in 2003 of a review study written by aerospace engineer Willie Soon and astronomer Sallie Baliunas in the journal Climate Research, which was quickly taken up by the G.W. Bush administration as a basis for amending the first Environmental Protection Agency Report on the Environment. The paper was strongly criticized by numerous scientists for its methodology and for its misuse of data from previously published studies, prompting concerns about the peer review process of the paper. The controversy resulted in the resignation of several editors of the journal and the admission by its publisher Otto Kinne that the paper should not have been published as it was. * The trapezoidal rule, in which the method of Riemann sums for numerical integration was republished in a Diabetes research journal, Diabetes Care. The method is almost always taught in high school calculus, and was thus considered an example of an extremely well known idea being re-branded as a new discovery. * A conference organized by the Wessex Institute of Technology was the target of an exposé by three researchers who wrote nonsensical papers (including one that was composed of random phrases). They reported that the papers were \\"reviewed and provisionally accepted\\" and concluded that the conference was an attempt to \\"sell\\" publication possibilities to less experienced or naive researchers. This may however be better described as a lack of any actual peer review, rather than peer review having failed. * In the humanities, one of the most infamous cases of plagiarism undetected by peer review involved Martin Stone, formerly professor of medieval and Renaissance philosophy at the Hoger Instituut voor Wijsbegeerte of the KU Leuven. Martin Stone managed to publish at least forty articles and book chapters that were almost entirely stolen from the work of others. Most of these publications appeared in highly rated peer-reviewed journals and book series. In popular culture In 2017, the Higher School of Economics in Moscow unveiled a \\"Monument to an Anonymous Peer Reviewer\\". It takes the form of a large concrete cube, or dice, with \\"Accept\\", \\"Minor Changes\\", \\"Major Changes\\", \\"Revise and Resubmit\\" and \\"Reject\\" on its five visible sides. Sociologist Igor Chirikov, who devised the monument, said that while researchers have a love-hate relationship with peer review, peer reviewers nonetheless do valuable but mostly invisible work, and the monument is a tribute to them.

The tablets of many tombs have fallen off; some, which could not be matched to their tombs, are mounted on the south wall. A remarkable portion of the graves are of people who died before reaching 50 years of age; many of the men and women buried are in their twenties and thirties. Several graves belong to infants - a poignant reminder of the harsh conditions the early settlers encountered in Penang. Behind this cemetery, accessible through a small door in the wall, is the adjacent Roman Catholic Cemetery. Restoration and conservation efforts The Cemetery is listed as a Category 1 heritage site. The first known clean-up of the cemetery was in 1894 by British authorities, who restored Light's grave on the centennial of his death. The cemetery had been closed to new burials two years earlier. No further restoration works took place at the cemetery until 1993–1994, when the Penang Heritage Trust repaired and cleaned the boundary walls and tombstones. Faded inscriptions were also re-inked, and a large signboard in Malay and English with a site plan of important tombs was put up. The cemetery was reopened in time for Francis Light's bicentennial.Restoration of Protestant Cemetery Penang Heritage Trust. The George Town World Heritage Incorporated (GTWHI), Penang Island Municipal Council (MPPP) and Penang Heritage Trust have been conducting maintenance works on the site regularly since then. In 2012, the cemetery underwent a major conservation effort, a joint project by the MPPP, the Penang Heritage Trust, and GTWHI, involving a complete overhaul of the site.http://www.gtwhi.com.my/index.php/special-projects/protestant-cemetery The first phase ended on 17 July 2012 and saw the removal of weeds, mosses and fungi on the headstones. The second phase entailed repairs to the tomb structures, and the removal of 80 trees encroaching on the old graves, and installing such amenities as a walkway, seats and rest areas for visitors. Restoration works were completed by the end of 2012. Many of the frangipani trees were trimmed or cleared, and the cemetery became more readily visible to passers-by. Most tombstones were thoroughly cleaned. Two centuries' worth of grime and mould were removed, revealing white plaster tombs and even gleaming marble stones. In 2013, phase one of another round of tomb repair works started to save the crumbling and sinking tombs, with another 30 tombstones being repaired in September 2014. In November 2014 another phase of restoration of the cemetery, a five-week upgrading, took place. Notable interments The cemetery is the final resting place of many of early Penang's most influential residents, including its founder and four Governors.

A real live Chinese dragon. Two thousand years earlier, to defend his kingdom, the dragon lent an emperor his all powerful pearl. Instead of being returned the pearl was buried with the emperor beneath his palace, and helpless without its source of power the dragon has remained entombed ever since. With the Dragon Pearl buried on the excavation site, Josh and Ling implore their parents for help, but met with disbelief the children realize they must find the pearl on their own. However thereʼs one who does believe them: archaeologist Philip Dukas (Robert Mammone), who wants to seize the pearlʼs awesome power for his own sinister ambitions.

Chinese dragons Dragons are legendary creatures that appear in the myths of many cultures. In the West, European dragons are depicted as reptilian or serpent- like creatures that breathe fire. The Chinese dragon is completely different. Chinese dragons are benevolent creatures that give emperors their power and are representative of all the forces of nature. In many representations of the Chinese dragons, they are shown pursuing the elusive flaming pearl, the symbol of all power and knowledge. There are nine different Chinese dragons. The dragon depicted in the story is the Golden Dragon, the most powerful and benevolent. There are many graphical depictions of the dragon, with variations according to location and historical period. The challenge was how to depict a \\"realistic\\" dragon in a live action movie: not only how the dragon should “look”, but also how it should “move” and sound. The movie was given official permission by the Chinese government and film authorities for Western artists to produce a CGI dragon in consultation with Chinese advisers. The dragon was produced by Rising Sun Pictures, whose work spans major blockbusters like the Harry Potter films, The Lord of The Rings and The Green Lantern. Production summary =Co-production= The Dragon Pearl is the first treaty co- production between Australia and China. A Treaty Co-production is where 2 producers from 2 countries, bound by international law, agree to a cultural, creative and financial association to produce a film together. The final production is regarded simultaneously a full Chinese film as well as a full Australian film. =Locations= The film was shot entirely in China at the Hengdian World Studios, reputedly the largest studio complex in the world with over 3 million square metres of built sets. Also other locations in and around Hengdian were used. Hengdian is located around 4 hours drive south of Shanghai in the province of Zhejiang. All post production was conducted in Adelaide, South Australia. CGI and visual effects were created by two Adelaide based companies, Rising Sun Pictures and Convergen.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on September 22, 2011. In the episode, Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) faces trouble telling Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) that she is running for public office, which will cause them to have to end their secret relationship. Meanwhile, Ron braces himself for the arrival of his first ex-wife, \\"Tammy I\\". Written by Dan Goor and directed by Troy Miller, the episode marks the beginning of Leslie Knope's campaign for public office. During the episode, Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) is given a promotion and becomes Leslie's campaign assistant. The episode featured the first appearance by guest star Patricia Clarkson as Ron's first ex-wife Tammy, who appeared in a multi-episode arc. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"I'm Leslie Knope\\" was seen by 4.11 million households in the 18 to 49 age demographic.http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/09/23/thursday- finals-big-bang-theory-the-x-factor-parks-recreation-and-whitney-adjusted- up/104707/ It received generally positive reviews, with commentators highlighting the characteristic developments and the effectiveness of the plot involving Leslie's city council campaign. Plot Taking place later the same night as last season's finale, Leslie (Amy Poehler) tells Ann (Rashida Jones) that she was approached by William (Johnny Sneed) and Elizabeth (Antonia Raftu), political scouts who recommended that she run for higher office. Leslie is conflicted about running due to her romantic relationship with Ben (Adam Scott), which would cause a possible scandal since he is Assistant to the City Manager. Meanwhile, upon learning that his first ex-wife Tammy (Patricia Clarkson) has arrived in town, Ron (Nick Offerman) grabs an emergency survival bag and flees to live in the wilderness for 180 days. Picking up three weeks later, an e-mail with a picture of a man's genitals is sent to all of the female employees. While Chris (Rob Lowe) and Ben investigate, Leslie is sent to do damage control by having a televised interview with reporter Perd Hapley. The interview goes so well that the scouts decide to have Leslie announce her candidacy for city council that Friday, rather than their original plan of three months later. Leslie panics because she had been putting off ending things with Ben, and she panics further when Ben presents her with a gift during a dinner, causing her to also flee to the wilderness to hide out with Ron. Tom (Aziz Ansari) visits the parks department with promotional material from his new job at Entertainment 720, where he works with Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz), but not even he is sure what Entertainment 720 does. He offers Andy (Chris Pratt) a job, but Andy turns him down, unsure of where to go with his life. Ann informs Chris that the genitals in the picture show symptoms of mumps. Chris and Ben discover that Joe (Kirk Fox) from the sewage department sent the e-mail and fire him, and Chris announces Ann's discovery to everyone. This prompts male employees to e-mail Ann pictures of their genitals because they are worried that they caught the mumps from Joe, so Chris has Dr. Harris (Cooper Thornton) come in to perform tests on everyone. At Ron's cabin, Leslie and Ron both realize they cannot run away from their problems and return to the parks department. Ron tells everyone that Leslie is going to be running for city council and will need an assistant to help her with the extra work, so April (Aubrey Plaza) suggests Andy, who is hired. Leslie later meets with Ben to break up with him, but to her surprise, the gift she left unwrapped at dinner is a \\"Knope 2012\\" button; Ben deduced by how Leslie was acting that she was offered to run for elected office, and the two break up amicably. She later announces her candidacy for city council. Tammy I—who is an IRS agent—later meets up with Ron in his office and hands him audit papers. Production Patricia Clarkson guest starred in this episode as Ron Swanson's ex-wife \\"Tammy I\\". \\"I'm Leslie Knope\\" was written by Dan Goor and directed by Troy Miller. It featured a guest appearance by Patricia Clarkson as Ron's first ex-wife, \\"Tammy I\\", who previously appeared in the third season finale episode \\"Li'l Sebastian\\", but was never shown to the audience until the end of \\"I'm Leslie Knope\\". The episode also featured guest appearances by common members of the recurring cast, including Ben Schwartz as Tom's friend and business partner Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Cooper Thornton as Dr. Harris, and stand-up comedian Kirk Fox as the sewage department member Joe, who was fired from his job in this episode. Antonia Raftu and Johnny Sneed appear as Leslie's campaign managers Elizabeth and William Barnes, respectively - they previously appeared at the end of the season 3 finale \\"Li'l Sebastian\\". The episode featured the friendly breakup of Leslie and Ben to avoid a scandal during Leslie's campaign for city council. The characters had previously begun dating following much romantic buildup in the third season, but had to keep the relationship a secret due to Chris' strict policy against boss-employee relationships within the department. Series co-creator Michael Schur commented on this in an interview, saying \\"...there's not just what is right for the characters, but what is right for the show and other considerations going into it. It's not just a perfect, delicate beautiful butterfly that's slowly unfolding its wings over the course of an entire season of TV.\\" He likened the relationship to the Jim and Pam romance in The Office, stating that ignorance of the decision-making process behind the story would have likely reduced its enjoyment. Schur reported that he had discussed the topic with various people including Poehler, Scott, and Schur's own wife, and felt that the breakup better suited the ambitious nature of Leslie's character. The episode also continues the story of Tom and Jean- Ralphio's company Entertainment 720, whose headquarters are located in a fully white office decorated with oddly shaped furniture. Schur had previously likened the office to a \\"hallucinogenic nightmare\\" and called it \\"maybe the craziest thing that's ever been on our series\\". Cultural references The side-story in which Joe of the sewage department sends a picture of his penis to every woman in the department parodies the 2011 Anthony Weiner sexting scandals, during which congressman Weiner sent sexually suggestive photos to various women. Reception =Ratings= The season premiere aired on Thursday, September 22, 2011, and was watched by 4.11 million viewers with a 2.1/6 ratings share in the 18-49 age group.http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/09/23/thursday-finals-big-bang- theory-the-x-factor-parks-recreation-and-whitney-adjusted-up/104707/ This was considerably lower than the previous season's premiere, \\"Go Big or Go Home\\", which was watched by 6.19 million households and was the most-watched Parks episode since its debut. =Reviews= \\"I'm Leslie Knope\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix praised Ron's implementation of physical comedy, and felt Leslie and Ben's breakup was handled \\"very, very well\\". He also praised the chemistry between Poehler and Offerman. He also stated that Clarkson's cameo set the stage well for the next episode. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called Leslie's storyline \\"excellent\\" and, like Sepinwall, praised her chemistry with Ron, as well as Ben. He also praised Chris' scenes in the picture subplot, feeling it improved the story. He ultimately gave the episode a B+. IGN’s Matt Fowler wrote that the premiere “brought both the laughs and the heartache” and that Parks and Recreation “has always been great at giving us just enough of its characters' relationships and then ending them before they out-stay their welcome.” Blair Marnell of Crave Online, giving the episode an 8.5 out of 10, praised the performances of Rashida Jones and Kirk Fox in the picture mystery subplot, and also felt that Leslie's city council campaign was the \\"right direction\\" for the character. Conversely, Kris King of StarPulse called the picture subplot \\"silly\\" and didn't feel it allowed to episode to go anywhere, though he did express interest in the expansion of Clarkson's role, and praised the scenes with Ron. In contrast, Jordan Cramer of TV Overmind felt Ann's story \\"outshined\\" that of Leslie, praising the episode for its timeliness in parodying the Anthony Weiner scandal.

It originally aired on NBC on September 29, 2011. In the episode, Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) is confronted by his first ex-wife, Tammy 1 (Patricia Clarkson) who has a malevolent influence on him, and Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) becomes involved in Ron's personal life. This episode marks the first and only appearance of Ron's mother, Tamara (Paula Pell). It garnered 4.33 million viewers, an increase in viewers from the previous episode's 4.11 million. Plot Leslie (Amy Poehler) is preparing for the \\"battle royale\\": a big meeting between all departments where they argue over funding. Ron's (Nick Offerman) intimidating presence and libertarian beliefs are pivotal for the parks department to succeed in getting more funds over other departments, but he is too busy preparing for his upcoming tax audit served to him by his first ex-wife, Tammy 1 (Patricia Clarkson). Leslie, Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt), and April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) help Ron but discover he has few actual receipts, just notes of purchase that he wrote himself and photographs of gentlemen's agreements. He does, however, have large amounts of gold that he has buried all over Pawnee. Ron explains that Tammy I had been present throughout most of his young life: she delivered him as a baby, was his teacher, and she even took his virginity. However, she was cold and controlling, which forever turned Ron off to blonde women after their divorce. Tammy I is horrified at Ron's recordkeeping and demands access to every part of his life for the audit. Tammy I's strict maternal nature intimidates everyone into following her orders, which impresses April. Over the course of the next week, Tammy I moves back in with Ron and assumes complete control over him. Ron shaves off his moustache, becomes kind, and refuses to do anything without Tammy I's approval. Leslie needs Ron to be his usual gruff self for the battle royale and confronts Tammy I about the audit, which she admits is fake - she decided to take Ron back after learning about all the gold he had. Leslie asks Ron's second ex-wife Tammy 2 (Megan Mullally) for help, but even she is scared of Tammy I after she attacked her with acid. They decide to ask Ron's survivalist mother, Tamara (Paula Pell) - nicknamed Tammy, or Tammy 0 - for help and she agrees. Tammy 0 challenges Tammy I to a \\"prairie drink-off\\" of highly alcoholic Swanson family mash liquor, but Tammy 0 says Ron will return to the farm forever if she wins. Leslie enters the drinking contest to save Ron from his mother and ex-wife, but the liquor immediately makes her too drunk to continue. Ron, finally fed up over people controlling him, chugs the jug dry and tells both Tammys to leave him alone. In a subplot, Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari) asks Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) to look over the finances of his company, Entertainment 720. Ben discovers that Tom and Jean-Ralphio Saperstein (Ben Schwartz) are wasting large amounts of money on a state-of-the-art office, giving employees high salaries with full benefits, and paying Detlef Schrempf and Roy Hibbert to play basketball all day, despite having no income. They ignore Ben's warnings that the company will go bankrupt in a month, but Tom later apologizes to Ben after discovering that he was right. In another subplot, Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones) asks Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe) to film a quick Public Service Announcement about diabetes, but the overly-enthusiastic Chris spends all day doing countless takes, making Ann wonder why she even dated him in the first place. Reception Many critics gave praise to the episode.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on October 6, 2011. In the episode, Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) promotes a book she has written about Pawnee to advance her campaign, but is sidetracked when Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) points out that she was not born in Pawnee. Meanwhile, Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones) attempts to bond with April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) and Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman), while Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari) and Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) attempt to charm the recently divorced Callamezzo. Written by Aisha Muharrar and directed by Dean Holland, the episode marks the return of guest star Mo Collins as well as the continuation of Leslie's campaign for public office. The book featured in this episode, Pawnee: The Greatest Town in America, is available for sale online and in book stores. The author is listed as \\"Leslie Knope.\\" The episode received positive reviews from critics, with praise going to the performance of guest star Mo Collins. Plot Leslie (Amy Poehler) has written a book called “Pawnee: The Greatest Town in America” and is preparing to promote it on local talk show “Pawnee Today.” She hopes that host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) will select it for her book club, which will guarantee high sales and help Leslie's campaign for city council. Before Leslie goes on the show, an anonymous source claims there is an inaccuracy in the book, which Leslie asks the parks department to find because she knows that Joan will reveal it during the interview as a form of gotcha journalism. Ann (Rashida Jones) is teamed up with Ron (Nick Offerman) and April (Aubrey Plaza) to fact check the book, and although she is determined to win them over with kindness, they want nothing to do with her. Leslie goes on “Pawnee Today” where Joan reveals that the inaccuracy is that Leslie was not born in Pawnee as she states in the book, and Joan refuses to put it in her book club. Leslie disputes the claim, but the damage from the interview is done: when Leslie is promoting the book, she is heckled by people who demand to see her birth certificate and it becomes an issue for her campaign for city council. Leslie shows her short-form birth certificate to her campaign advisors William Barnes (Johnny Sneed) and Elizabeth (Antonia Raftu), but since it only lists the county that she was born in, they say she needs to produce her long-form birth certificate, which is in the hall of records in Eagleton, Pawnee's hated rival town. Andy (Chris Pratt) steals the birth certificate and Leslie is horrified to learn that she was actually born in Eagleton. Leslie hires Tom (Aziz Ansari) to charm Joan into putting the book in her book club, which Tom is confident of doing because he always playfully flirts with Joan. However, he calls everything off when she begins hitting on him for real due to her impending divorce. Joan becomes very drunk during lunch with Tom and Ben (Adam Scott), forcing them to carry her home. Meanwhile, after trying and failing to win over Ron and April, Ann finally gets them to open up by telling gross stories about her job at the hospital. Leslie's mother Marlene (Pamela Reed) admits that Leslie was born in Eagleton, but only because Pawnee's hospital was overrun with raccoons when she went into labor. Still, Leslie is depressed and feels that she is not a true Pawneean. Chris (Rob Lowe) disagrees, telling Leslie that she is the most dedicated resident in town and where she was born does not matter. Hearing this, Leslie goes back on “Pawnee Today” and reveals the truth, but also proves how much she loves Pawnee by reciting the many people and places in town. Joan allows the book into the book club, but also puts a big “Gotcha!” sticker on the back of the book.

The episode was written by Alan Yang and was directed by Charles McDougall. Plot Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) is the leader of a Boy Scout-like group called the Pawnee Rangers, with Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) as his assistant. A girl had previously not been allowed to join the Rangers because it is for boys only, so Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) created the girls- only Pawnee Goddesses, with Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones) and April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) as her assistants. Leslie is determined to prove that her group is better to avenge the past rejection, so she decides to arrange a weekend camping trip for the Goddesses at the same camping ground as the Rangers. Meanwhile, after noticing that Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) is feeling down, Donna Meagle (Retta) and Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari) invite him on their annual \\"Treat Yo Self\\" trip, where they spend a day spending extravagantly on things they don't need. Jerry Gergich is left alone in the office, so Chris (Rob Lowe) gives him the day off; Jerry invites Chris to have lunch with him and his daughter Millicent \\"Milly\\" Gergich (Sarah Wright), and Chris agrees when he sees that Milly is very attractive. The Pawnee Rangers become jealous of the Pawnee Goddesses, who appear to be having a lot more fun on the trip as they have puppies, pillow fights, and candy, while the Rangers are only given beans and told to build a meager shelter. Leslie is glad her efforts to make the boys jealous worked but the Goddesses, after a public forum, decide to let the Rangers join them if they want to. Every Ranger - including Andy - defects to the Goddesses, making Leslie feel sorry when she spots Ron sitting at a campfire all alone. She apologizes for being so competitive, and Ron laments that children no longer want to learn tough survival skills, admitting Leslie has the better group. To make Ron feel better, Leslie takes out an ad in the paper for a new group of self-reliant survivalists called \\"The Swansons\\", and Ron is surprised to find a group of eager children (girls and boys) in his office ready to join. Ben is unable to enjoy himself with Tom and Donna, but opens up after splurging on a Batman costume. He starts to cry and tells them about a recent break-up, not mentioning it is Leslie. Chris hits it off with Milly during lunch and tells Jerry that he plans on asking her out on a date and insists on being open with Jerry about their activities; it takes a weird turn the next day when Chris tells Jerry that the date went well and that Milly spent the night at his house afterwards.

Biography  Born in La Talaudière in the département of Loire, Maurice Fleuret received his secondary education at the École normale d'instituteurs in Montbrison. In 1952 he moved to Paris and began studying music in the classes of Norbert Dufourcq, Olivier Messiaen, and Roland Manuel at the Conservatoire de Paris, graduating in 1956 . In 1955 he became a lecturer of the Jeunesses musicales de France, a position he held until 1965. From 1974 he became artistic adviser to this same organization . In the meantime, he had undertaken other activities as well. In 1958 he edited the review Musique de tous les temps, from 1960 to 1964 he was director of the music division of the Centre National de Diffusion Culturelle, and in 1962 he began a career as a music critic, first for the France observateur and then from 1964 for its successor, the Nouvel observateur. In 1962 he also became a radio producer, first at ORTF and then at Radio France, where he had a regular weekly programme titled Evénements-musique (; ). Obsessed by the desire \\"to understand contemporary music\\", he began his collaboration at the Nouvel Observateur by stating at the outset that he would not report \\"concerts where the three B's—Brahms, Bach, and Beethoven—are heard all night long\\" . He wanted to \\"create a new musical criticism, a chronicle of introduction to contemporary music, and not one of reporting\\" that would \\"put everybody off\\" . But even if his articles had \\"as high a profile abroad as in France\\" , he could not just criticize the ideas of others without trying to form his own. In 1967, he decided to abandon his lecturing to devote himself to entering into music in new environments. From 1967 to 1974, he organized the Journées de Musique Contemporaine de Paris (Days of Contemporary Music Paris), where he brought together some twenty thousand people in cycles devoted to composers such as Luciano Berio, Pierre Boulez, or Pierre Henry. Although his primary interest was in contemporary music, he was also very active as an ethnomusicologist, making over thirty journeys to Africa and Asia, and in particular doing field work in West Africa in 1966 and 1967. He also organized many concerts of traditional African and Asian music in Europe . He directed with the same success enterprises as diverse and unique as the Stockhausen Festival in Shiraz-Persepolis in 1972 or the Xenakis Festival in Bonn in 1974. The producer from 1974 of a weekly magazine (Events-Music) on the radio, three years later he gave up his position at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris—which he had held since 1967—to dedicate himself to the Festival of Lille where Pierre Mauroy had been mayor since 1973. When the Socialists came to power under François Mitterrand in November 1981, Mauroy became Prime Minister, and appointed Fleuret director of music and dance in the Ministry of Culture headed by Jack Lang. In this post, he promoted the creation of music festivals, increased subsidies of all kinds, and vigorously defended the major projects of the president: the construction of the Opera Bastille, and the Cité de La Villette. After the conservatives came to power in March 1986, he remained for some months in order to protect the president's projects, but gave up his position in September. Even after the Socialists returned to power under Mitterrand in May 1988 he stubbornly refused to resume the post of director of music . He preferred from that time to concern himself with the Gustav Mahler Music Library, which he had founded in 1986 with Henry-Louis de La Grange based on their personal collections. This was the first private music library in France, with twenty thousand volumes, nine thousand scores, two thousand five hundred files on composers and contemporary artists, forty thousand recordings, especially records amount of money bringing invaluable and unpublished music from the preceding century and a half, constantly enriched with new gifts. While still at the helm since 1988 of the collection \\"Music\\" of Publishing Bernard Coutaz, he died in Paris on 22 March 1990. Writings * 1962. Musique hongroise.

DeBose. The film focuses on cultural language and practices that negatively impact the development of a healthy sense of self. The filmmaker's commentary asserts a criticism of the way wavy hair, lighter skin and a slender nose are still considered more attractive in the black community in light of historical and contemporary movements which have sought to liberate black self-esteem. As a practicing and teaching sociologist, the filmmaker sought to illuminate the notion of symbolic violence through the lens of Pierre Bourdieu and spark conversation not just in the black community but all other communities as well. Cultural practices which value some features but not others are issues common to every family and every community. For the filmmaker this is an issue of valuing and finding beauty in every human being. Synopsis The film begins with a series of outdoor shots narrated by the filmmaker. The viewer follows her fuzzy form as she approaches the camera and tells a story of people remarking on the features they hope her unborn child will be born with. The film continues with a collection of personal stories juxtaposed against discussion and analysis from professionals and academics. Viewers get glimpses of the filmmaker's pregnant form as she travels through the landscape. The film ends with the sight of the filmmaker's child and a quote by bell hooks on shame and the life cycle. Release The film had its Chicago debut at the Black Harvest Film Festival on August 22, 2011.

Consequently, the Internet stream of WKQX ceased as a stream of the station at midnight and began programming separately as a new streaming service, initially without DJs or commercials, under the \\"Q101.com\\" name.

She was the principal wife to the Tu'i Tonga though she may have been of higher social rank than him because of her matrilineal descent. After a vacancy in the Tu'i Kanokupolu title, she used her status to designated herself successor, reigning on Tongatapu for slightly less than one year starting in perhaps 1792 before being forcibly deposed by her distant relative Tuku’aho. Tupoumoheofo retreated to retirement in the northern Tongan Island of Vava’u under the protection of the 'Ulukalala family. Family and Social Rank In the late 18th century, Tupoumoheofo may have been the highest-ranking person in Tonga due to her matrilineal descent.Paul van der Grijp, Strategic Murders: Social Drama in Tonga's Chiefly System (Western Polynesia), p.538 Her “mother’s mother was Tamaha, the sacred eldest daughter of the Tu’i Tonga’s eldest sister, and thus the person holding the highest rank in Tonga(van der Grijp 538)”. She also earned high status through her patrilineal descent as her father was Tupoulahi, the 7th Kanokupolu. Tupoumoheofo was a sister of Tu’ihalafatai, the 9th Tu’i Kanokupolu.van der Grijp, p.539 In the late 1760s, Tupoumoheofo married Tu’i Tonga Paulaho, the 36th Tu'i Tonga, as principal wife (the moheofo), whom she is often considered to have helped in assassinating in 1791.H. J. M. Claessen, A Survey of the History of Tonga: Some New Views, pp. 510-511 With her husband Paulaho, Tupoumoheofo had several daughters.Phyllis Herda, Gender, Rank and Power in 18th Century Tonga, p.202 Fuanunuiava, the future 38th Tu’i Tonga, is often said also to be a son of this marriage and that obtaining him his future title was one of Tupoumoheofo’s main goals. A genealogy collected by Neil Gunson suggests, however, that Fuanunuiava was not Tupoumoheofo’s son but instead Paulaho’s son from his secondary wife, Fokonofo(202 herda) and therefore Tupoumoheofo would have little reason to push him into power.Herda, p. 202 The Death of Her Husband There is some disagreement over when Paulaho was murdered – whether it was 1784 or a decade later.Claessen, p.510 He most likely died in 1791 or 1792, just before Tupoumoheofo claimed the title of Tu’i Kanokupolu.Claessen p.510 In an interview by a Spanish sailor years later, Tupoumoheofo claimed to have been a leading participant in an alliance of the Tu’i Kanokupolu lineage that , “set out from Tonga with some 20 large canoes, putting into the ports of Annamoka [Nomuka] and Happai [Ha’apai]. They passed to Vavao [Vava’u] where Paulajo [Paulaho], as the head of his people, received them. There was a clash which ended with the death of the latter at the hands of Vuna, after these two leaders fought hand to hand…”Hedra, p.206 This put her in alliance with Mumui, who, though later her challenger, was a relative of the Tu’i Kanokupolu line. The result was to completely debase the power of the Tu’i Tonga line and elevate the Tu’i Kanokupolu line. Ascension to Tu'i Kanokupolu Around 1791, the 11th Kanokupolu, Mulikiha’ame’a, gave up his title rather quickly after attaining it.Hedra, p.203 Some surmise that either he lost influence,Hedra, p.203 he obtained a different title, that Mumui and Tuku’aho forced him out, or that Tupoumoheofo herself instigated the change. Though the next Kanokupolu would be officially voted on by the Ha’a Ngata chiefs,van der Grijp, p.153 ancestral protectors of the Kanokupolu line in Hihifo, Tongatapu, the decision was really Tupoumoheofo’s because of her rank. Mumui, a powerful elder chief on Tongatapu, expected to receive the title. He shared ancestry with Tupoumoheofo through Ma’afu’out’itonga, the sixth Kanokupolu, but his was of a lesser line.Hedra, p.204 Tuku’aho, Mumui’s politically ambitious son and then governor of ‘Eua, strongly supported his father’s claim with hopes of securing power for their line.Hedra, p.205 Tupoumoheofo, however, did the unexpected by naming herself as Kanokupolu. She, “went to Hihifo, put a ta’ovala mat about her waist, and sat with her back to the koka tree beneath which the installation of the Tu’i Kanokupolu took place. Then she came back and declared herself Tu’i Kanokupolu.”Hedra, p.204 This appropriateness of ascension is controversial among historians. Early European missionaries in Tonga labeled her act as, “subversive”, “tyrannical”, “odious in the extreme”Hedra, p.195 and an anthropologist has considered it “unrightful\\"van der Grijp, p.542 More recent scholarship has suggested that her action was not actually without historical precedent and was “positively in line with her traditional position and rank.”van der Grijp, p.542 Tupoumoheofo did have the immediate the support of many chiefs.Hedra, p.204 War with Tuku’aho Incensed by Tupoumoheofo taking the title of Tu’i Kanokupolu instead of giving it to his own father, Mumui, Tuku’aho denounced Tupoumoheofo and seized some her estates.Claessen, p.511 She refused to step down, reminding him that he was of a lower rank than she was.van der Grijp, p.541 She threatened his life if he continued his insubordination. In 1793 he invaded Tongatapu with an army and defeated her, though the Tongatapu chiefs guaranteed her safety because, “she was the daughter of a Tamaha”van der Grijp and allowed her into exile in Vava’u. Tupoumoheofo soon raised a new army and attacked Tongatapu but was again unsuccessful. “This time she was pursued to Ha’apai, where her army was trapped on the island of Ha’ano [sic] and slaughtered. Its bones were still easily visible in great number half a century later.”Hedra, p.151 As victor in the brief war, Tuku’aho appointed his father Tu’i Kanokupolu.I. C. Campbell, The Demise of the Tu'i Kanokupolu Tonga 1799-1827, p.151 Tupoumoheofo spent the remainder of her days in Vava’u under the safety of the Ulukalala family, which was at odds with Tuku’aho and Mumui. It was Finau Ulukalala II and his relative Toupouniua who assassinated Tuku’aho in 1799.van der Grijp, p.535 William Mariner, a British sailor taken in by Finau Ulukalala from 1806 to 1810, writes that the assassination was done at the insistence of Tupoumoheofo to avenge her earlier defeat. Legacy and sources Most of the primary sources about Tupoumoheofo come from Europeans who often had conflicting accounts, descriptions, timelines, and biases. The absence of consensus makes her a controversial figure. Many of these historiographers were guests of Tupoumoheofo’s enemies, who eventually gained power and defeated her; the descendants of these enemies are Tonga’s current royal family. These sources tend to perceive her negatively as an egregious usurper of power. She is also often accused of using her power to implant her supposed son Fuanunuiava as the Tu’i Tonga. Recent scholarship, however, claims her actions were within historical precedent and acceptable to her social rank. There is also some evidence that suggests that Fuanunuiava was not in fact her son. There is agreement that at the close of the 18th century the old order that divided responsibilities between the Tu’i Tonga, Tu'i Ha'atakalaua, and Tu'i Kanokupolu chiefly lines dissolved, and that the Tu’i Kanokupolu line (controlled by the Tupou family) eclipsed the others. Tupoumoheofo’s actions, and those of her immediate successors, are best understood as an attempt to consolidate power during this chaotic time.

Central Bank administers control over the credit that the commercial banks grant. Such a method is used by RBI to bring \\"Economic Development with Stability\\". It means that banks will not only control inflationary trends in the economy but also boost economic growth which would ultimately lead to increase in real national income stability. In view of its functions such as issuing notes and custodian of cash reserves, credit not being controlled by RBI would lead to Social and Economic instability in the country. Need for credit control Controlling credit in the economy is amongst the most important functions of the Reserve Bank of India. The basic and important needs of credit control in the economy are- *To encourage the overall growth of the \\"priority sector\\" i.e. those sectors of the economy which is recognized by the government as \\"prioritized\\" depending upon their economic condition or government interest. These sectors broadly totals to around 15 in number. *To keep a check over the channelization of credit so that credit is not delivered for undesirable purposes. *To achieve the objective of controlling inflation as well as deflation. *To boost the economy by facilitating the flow of adequate volume of bank credit to different sectors. *To develop the economy. Objectives of credit control The broad objectives of credit control policy in India have been- *Ensure an adequate level of liquidity enough to attain high economic growth rate along with maximum utilisation of resource but without generating high inflationary pressure. *Attain stability in the exchange rate and money market of the country. *Meeting the financial requirement during a slump in the economy and in the normal times as well. *Control business cycle and meet business needs. Methods of credit control There are two methods that the RBI uses to control the money supply in the economy- * Qualitative method * Quantitative method During the period of inflation Reserve Bank of India tightens its policies to restrict the money supply, whereas during deflation it allows the commercial bank to pump money in the economy. =Qualitative method= By Quality we mean the uses to which bank credit is directed. For example- the bank may feel that spectators or the big capitalists are getting a disproportionately large share in the total credit, causing various disturbances and inequality in the economy, while the small-scale industries, consumer goods industries and agriculture are starved of credit. Correcting this type of discrepancy is a matter of qualitative credit control. Qualitative method controls the manner of channelizing of cash and credit in the economy. It is a 'selective method' of control as it restricts credit for certain section where as expands for the other known as the 'priority sector' depending on the situation. Tools used under this method are- Marginal requirement Marginal requirement of loan current value of security offered for ban-value of loans granted. The marginal requirement is increased for those business activities, the flow of whose credit is to be restricted in the economy. For Example:- A person mortgages his property worth ₹ 1,00,000 against loan. The bank will give loan of ₹ 80,000. The marginal requirement here is 20% Rationing of credit Under this method there is a maximum limit to loans and advances that can be made, which the commercial banks cannot exceed. RBI fixes ceiling for specific categories. Such rationing is used for situations when credit flow is to be checked, particularly for speculative activities. Minimum of \\"capital: total assets\\" (ratio between capital and total asset) can also be prescribed by Reserve Bank of India. Publicity RBI uses media for the publicity of its views on the current market condition and its directions that will be required to be implemented by the commercial banks to control the unrest. Though this method is not very successful in developing nations due to high illiteracy existing making it difficult for people to understand such policies and its implications. Direct Action Under the banking regulation Act, the central bank has the authority to take strict action against any of the commercial banks that refuses to obey the directions given by Reserve Bank of India. There can be a restriction on advancing of loans imposed by Reserve Bank of India on such banks. e.g. – RBI had put up certain restrictions on the working of the Metropolitan co-operative banks. Also the 'Bank of Karad' had to come to an end in 1992. Moral Suasion This method is also known as \\"moral persuasion\\" as the method that the Reserve Bank of India, being the apex bank uses here, is that of persuading the commercial banks to follow its directions/orders on the flow of credit. It also be part of meetings between RBI and Commercial Banks. RBI persuades the commercial bank to follow their policies. RBI puts a pressure on the commercial banks to put a ceiling on credit flow during inflation and be liberal in lending during deflation. Quantitative method  Graph showing variations in the Bank Rate from 1935–2011 (current year) By quantitative credit control we mean the control of the total quantity of credit. For Example- consider that the Central Bank, on the basis of its calculations, considers that Rs. 50,000 is the maximum safe limit for the expansion of credit. But the actual credit at that given point of time is Rs. 55,000(say).Thus it then becomes necessary for the central bank to bring it down to 50,000 by tightening its policies. Similarly if the actual credit is less, say 45,000, then the apex bank regulates its policies in favor of pumping credit into the economy. Different tools used under this method are- Chart showing effect of increase in bank rate =Bank rate= Bank rate also known as the discount rate is the official minimum rate at which the central bank of the country is ready to re discount approved bills of exchange or lend on approved securities. Section 49 of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934, defines Bank Rate as \\"the standard rate at which it (RBI) is prepared to buy or re-discount bills of exchange or other commercial paper eligible for purchase under this Act\\". When the commercial bank for instance, has lent or invested all its available funds and has little or no cash over and above the prescribed minimum, it may ask the central bank for funds. It may either re- discount some of its bills with the central bank or it may borrow from the central bank against the collateral of its own promissory notes. In either case, the central bank accommodates the commercial bank and increases the latter's cash reserves. This Rate is increased during the times of inflation when the money supply in the economy has to be controlled. At any time there are various rates of interest ruling at the market, like the deposit rate, lending rate of commercial banks, market discount rate and so on. But, since the central bank is the leader of the money market and the lender of the last resort, all other rates are closely related to the bank rate. The changes in the bank rate are, therefore, followed by changes in all other rates as the money market. The graph on the right hand side shows variations in the bank rate since 1935–2011. Working of the bank rate This section will answer how Bank Rate policy operates to control the level of prices and business activity in the country. Changes in bank rate are introduced with a view to controlling the price levels and business activity, by changing the demand for loans. Its working is based upon the principle that changes in the bank rate results in changed interest rate in the market. Suppose a country is facing inflationary pressure. The central bank, in such situations, will increase the bank rate thereby resulting to a hiked lending rate. This increase will discourage borrowing. It will also lead to a fall in the business activity due to following reasons. *Employment of some factors of production will have to be reduced by the business people. * The manufacturers and stock exchange dealers will have to liquidate their stocks, which they held through bank loans, to pay off their loans. The effect of Rise in bank rate by the central bank . Hence, we can conclude that hike in Bank Rate leads to fall in price level and a fall in the Bank Rate leads to an increase in price level i.e. they share an inverse relationship.

In September 2011, Knight debated former CTV News journalist Kai Nagata about the future of Canadian TV news. Prior to the debate Nagata earned brief notoriety for quitting CTV and publicizing his reasons for leaving a career in mainstream TV behind on his blog. The exchange was published online on The Mark and The Huffington Post Canada. Knight's conclusion in the debate was that journalists across Canada need to “meet, plot, and retake ownership of our news from the cynical establishment.” He called on journalists to form Howard Beale (the mad anchor in the movie Network) societies under the motto \\"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this any more.\\" References Category:Canadian television producers Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Tim Knight"},{"id":"33159136","text":"Ilısu (literally \\"warm water\\") is a Turkish place name and may refer to: *Ilısu, Aksaray, a town is Güzelyurt district of Aksaray Province, Turkey * Ilısu, Göynücek, a village in Göynücek district of Amasya Province, Turkey *Ilısu, Gülnar, a village in Gülnar district of Mersin Province, Turkey *İlisu, Azerbaijan Note the difference between the two Turkish 'I's: dotted(i=ee) and dotless (ı=eh) especially in capitals (I,İ)  See also  *Ilısu Dam, a dam under construction in Turkey ** Ilısu Dam Campaign, an international campaign to stop the construction of the dam ","title":"Ilısu"},{"id":"33159162","text":"Amoruso is a surname.

The attack, which shocked the Israeli public, was one of the more prominent stabbing attacks in a series of stabbing attacks that took place in Israel during the early 1990s, which signified to many in the Israeli public a deterioration of their personal security at the time. The attack On 24 May 1992, at around 7:30 am, 18-year-old Palestinian militant Fuad Muhammad Abdulhadi Amrin murdered 15-year-old Israeli schoolgirl Helena Rapp, by stabbing her with a knife at the corner of Ben-Gurion and Jabotinsky streets in the coastal Israeli city of Bat Yam, while she was on her way to the bus stop in order to get to school. Aftermath The perpetrator was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment. The Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack. The attack was one of the reasons that led to the targeted killing of the Islamic Jihad founder Fathi Shikaki in 1995.Ronen Bergman, The secret war with Iran, pg. 215 Following the attack, thousands of Bat Yam residents rioted in the streets of the city for five days without significant interference, causing heavy damage to property while occasionally attacking random Arab-looking by-passers.The real two-state solution, salon.com, 26 November 2007; accessed 19 November 2014. Among the organizers of the riots was Baruch Marzel, who was later sentenced to 8 months probation for his part in the riots. After 5 days, during which Helena Rapp's father Ze'ev Rapp encouraged the riots, he eventually responded to a police request to help disperse the rioters and as a result the riots subsided. In the Or Commission Israeli Chief of Police Assaf Hefetz criticized the way the police handled the rioting after Rapp's murder and claimed that the riots should have been dispersed much earlier.Assaf Hefetz's comments, orwatch.org; accessed 19 November 2014. After the incident, Ze'ev Rapp, Helena's father, devoted his life to commemorating his daughter and to public activities as the chairman of the Israeli Victims of Terror Attacks Organization.Victims of Terror Attacks Organization profile, inn.co.il; accessed 19 November 2014. Following the attack, which took place during the 1992 Israeli legislative elections, many Israeli politicians showed up in Bat Yam and/or spoke out about the attack. The Minister of Police Roni Milo and the leader of the right-wing nationalist Moledet party Rehavam Ze'evi were present at Helena Rapp's funeral. Labor Party politician Shimon Peres arrived in Bat-Yam and despite some concerns was welcomed by local residents. Much of the Israeli public blamed the right- winged Shamir government for the deterioration to the personal security of Israelis during this period. Videos of the rioting that took place in Bat Yam were featured in Labor Party electoral ads which blamed the deteriorating security situation on the Likud government.The elections in Israel, 1992, books.google.com; accessed 19 November 2014. =Release of assailant= On 18 October 2011, Fuad Muhammad Abdulhadi Amrin, who was originally sentenced to a life sentence, was released to Gaza as part of the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas.Fuad Muhammad Abdulhadi Amrin release in Gilad Shalit exchange, shabas.gov.il; accessed 19 November 2014.

Location It lies between the River Mersey and the Manchester Ship Canal in Runcorn, Halton, England. It is reached via The Old Quay Bridge, a Grade II listed swing bridge that was built in 1894 and which crosses over the Manchester Ship Canal. The island was originally Runcorn saltmarsh. When the Manchester Ship Canal was cut through Runcorn the island was physically detached from the town and stranded between the canal and the River Mersey. Wigg is not formally an island, as it is not surrounded on all sides by water. A strip of land separates the canal and the river. The strip ensures the canal stays in water and has a cycle path leading from Wigg to Port Warrington and Moore Nature Reserve. History The island is named after Charles Wigg, who started an alkali works there in the 1860s to extract copper from its ore. The factory was known as \\"Wigg works\\" and in 1890 it was bought by the United Alkali Company. This company was bought by ICI in 1926 and the original Wigg works was closed to make way for a new chemical factory on the site.

Kushi was one of the organizers of the first national art exhibition in Albania, which took place in May 1931 at the Café Kursal in Tirana. The success of this exhibition led him and other painters to the creation of the Friends of the Arts Society (Shoqnia Miqt’ e Artit), which had as a primary goal the foundation of a national gallery. Between 1937 and 1943 he lived in Korçë where he was in contact with other known painters like Vangjush Mio and Foto Stamo.

LimaCorporate was the first to bring 3D Printing to a Hospital Setting. History The founder of LimaCorporate, Carlo Leopoldo Lualdi, began manufacturing surgical instruments in 1945. In 1953, the first helicopter prototype was created, relying solely on Italian know-how. Since then, and until the year 2000, LimaCorporate became one of the most important suppliers in the aerospace sector.

In the 1990s, the company continued to focus on the medical devices market with the specific aim of broadening its presence on a global level. In the year 2000, this approach led to Lima’s decision to exclusively specialize in the production of Orthopedic implants. In the 2000s, LimaCorporate made the decision to develop the EBM (Electron Beam Melting) technology, or additive manufacturing, to address the functional limitations of the coatings applied to traditional prosthetic implants. In 2007, the company’s first acetabular cup featuring TT, LimaCorporate’s proprietary 3D printing technology, was developed and implanted for the first time in Italy.

Yuxiang is one of main traditional flavors in Sichuan. Yuxiang shredded pork appeared in recent decades. The creator is a chef from Sichuan who lived during the early Chinese republic. Yuxiang (sometimes translated as \\"fish flavor\\") is made of pao la jiao (Sichuan pickled chili pepper), Chuan salt, soy, white sugar, bruised ginger, garlic and green star but no fish. This seasoning has nothing to do with fish, instead imitating the seasoning and method, which people in Sichuan use when cooking fish. The seasoning contains salty, sweet, sour, hot, and fresh tastes, making the food more delicious. Chengdu Tongxian was published in 1909 and recorded 1328 kinds of Sichuan food, however, it did not include food using yuxiang, which showed that yuxiang shredded pork appeared after 1909. It is said that, many years ago, a family liked eating fish very much and they were particular with the seasoning. They always put some green onion, ginger, garlic, soy, vinegar, wine and so on when they cook fish. One day, the wife put the remaining seasoning from last night into the food because she did not want to waste the seasoning. She at first thought her husband would not like it, but unexpectedly, he liked it very much. Later, this food was improved by many Sichuan people. Other dishes using yuxiang have also appeared in Sichuan menus, for example, as yuxiang pork liver, yuxiang eggplant, and yuxiang three silk (). Its major ingredient is pork. People select and use thirty percent fat and seventy percent lean pork, shredding and frying, which can make the food fresher and softer.

The cable would have totalled 12,750 km (7,920 miles) in length, and the initial investment was projected to be US$350 million. Customers included Vodafone New Zealand, Australian ISP iiNet, and the Kiwi Advanced Research and Education Network in New Zealand. Routes *Auckland <=> Sydney *Auckland <=> Los Angeles Pacific Fibre cable history In July 2011, Pacific Fibre selected TE SubCom, a TE Connectivity company, to deploy the cable. Marine route surveys began after permitting studies for California and Australia were completed in March 2012. In April 2012, a US customer agreed to purchase connectivity services. Fundraising for the project was scheduled to complete in June 2012. On August 1, Pacific Fibre announced they were unable to secure sufficient investment and the planned cable was discontinued. \\"I think it's tragic news for the New Zealand market,\\" said Telecommunications Users Association CEO Paul Brislen. \\"We've spent millions of shareholder funds trying to get this done and despite getting some good investor support we have not been able to find the level of investment required in New Zealand initially and more broadly offshore,\\" said Pacific Fibre chairman Sam Morgan. Pacific Fibre subsequently ceased operations. In November 2012, German entrepreneur Kim Dotcom announced his intention to revive the Pacific Fibre broadband cable project. The plan to lay a 12,950 km cable between Auckland, Sydney and Los Angeles was abandoned in August when its backers couldn't raise the NZ$400 million they needed. Dotcom said his new Mega company would require more bandwidth than the current Southern Cross Cable can provide, but would allow him to provide \\"free broadband for all Kiwis\\". The announcement was welcomed by technology commentators in New Zealand, but some suggested the United States' allegations over alleged internet piracy could scupper any proposal.

Chasan is a kind of afternoon tea snack and that is why it is so named, as \\"Cha\\" means tea. Huai'an Chasan has a long history of over one hundred years.

But he just made a pig of himself. When he passed Shan Yang (ancient Huai'an) county, he had a miraculous dream. In his dream, a golden phoenix landed at the top of Zhenhuai Lou with a most delicate Sanzi (predecessor of Chasan) in its mouth. Someone told him that the phoenix was an immortal phoenix and if one could get the most delicate Sanzi in its mouth, he would live forever. When he woke up, he planned to make his dream a peg to collect wealth for himself. So he ordered his subordinates to seek for the golden phoenix, or else they would be punished and fined. Of course, the subordinates could not find a golden phoenix. Finally, they seized an old man who made Sanzi for a living and told the corrupt official that the golden phoenix was hidden by the old man. The official forced the old man to hand over the phoenix and the most delicate Sanzi before dawn, otherwise, his family would all be sentenced to death. The old man could do nothing but wait for death. His grandchild called Jinfeng comforted him that she could save her family. When dawn came, Jinfeng carried a handful of Chasan and jumped into a well. Suddenly, she turned into a golden phoenix and flew to the corrupt official. The official was eating and drinking. The phoenix dived suddenly and pecked out his eyes. Then the golden phoenix turned into the most delicate Sanzi, and people called it Chasan.

Moonwalking with Einstein debuted at no. 3 on the New York Times bestseller list and stayed on the list for 8 weeks. Synopsis Foer describes his book as participatory journalism in the world of competitive memorization and attempts to delineate the capacity of the human mind. He sets out to investigate the underpinnings of those with enhanced memory, soon finding himself at the 2005 U.S. Memory Championship. He covers the scientific basis of memory creation and historical attitudes towards memory, including its negative reputation in the Western educational system, a perception which Foer is largely opposed to. He explores common mnemonic tools for improving memory: the techniques of Roman rhetoricians and the tannaim (\\"reciters\\") of Judea, the Major System and the PAO System for memorizing numbers and cards, and Mind Mapping, a note-taking technique developed by Tony Buzan. These methods are all a form of the method of loci, in which data is stored in a sequence of memorable images that can be translated back into their original form. He espouses deliberate practice as the path to expertise, and declares psychological barriers as the largest obstacles to improved human performance. The book describes the prodigious memory and 87-point IQ of Kim Peek, the inspiration for the 1988 movie Rain Man. Foer discusses how Daniel Tammet's index finger slides around on a table as he performs mental calculations in a documentary; mental multiplication experts and mnemonists that Foer speaks with imply that Tammet's claims, involving synesthetic morphing shapes and colors standing in for complex numerical feats, are questionable. World memory champion Ben Pridmore tells Foer that \\"[t]here are a lot of people in the world that can do those things.\\" Foer notes that Tammet, competing under his previous legal name \\"Daniel Corney\\", won the gold medal at the World Memory Championships' \\"Names and Faces\\" event. Tammet had tested poorly in facial recognition under Simon Baron-Cohen's assessment of synesthetic abilities; Foer states that poor facial recognition ability is a suitable indicator of inborn \\"savant\\" status, as opposed to \\"savant-like tricks [developed] through methodical training\\". He also discovers self-promotional forum posts advertising \\"mind power and advanced memory skills\\" courses as well as psychic phone readings (the latter under the pseudonym \\"Daniel Andersson\\"). In a cached version of \\"danieltammet.com\\", Foer finds Tammet relating details omitted from his autobiography Born on a Blue Day: Foer interviews Tammet on several occasions over the course of several weeks, during which he confronts him with the forum posts. Foer also tests Tammet: Foer, with the coaching of Ed Cooke, practises traditional memory techniques for a year, winning the 2006 USA Memory Championship and breaking the U.S. record in speed cards. He goes on to represent the US at the World Memory Championships in London, placing thirteenth and winning bronze in the \\"Names and Faces\\" event, but failing to become a Grand Master of Memory. Reception Bill Gates has called the book \\"absolutely phenomenal\\". Claire Lambrecht for Salon writes: \\"Foer talks with people from both spectrums of the memory divide—from Kim Peek to the guy dubbed \\"The Most Forgetful Man in the World\\"—and their conversations offer insight into the relevance of memory in a society increasingly dominated by smart phones, Google, and Wikipedia. Alexandra Horowitz for the New York Times called the book \\"engaging\\", though she does take issue with how Foer \\"inexplicably\\" attacks Daniel Tammet. Ultimately, though Horowitz concludes that \\"Foer is too engaging to put us off. His assemblage of personal mnemonic images is riotous. He makes suspenseful an event animated mostly by the participants’ “dramatic temple massaging”. Michiko Kakutani, in the New York Times, called the book \\"captivating\\". Peter Conrad in The Observer dismisses Foer's account as reality TV in book form, stating: \\"After performing the tricks required of him, he is ushered off into oblivion; by telling the story all over again five years later, he is hoping to prolong his meagre allocation of fame and persuade the world to remember his name. But I have too much on my mind, and now intend to exercise my prerogative as a thinker by forgetting him.\\" Elizabeth Loftus, writing in the Wall Street Journal, calls the book \\"uplifting\\", and that \\"It shows that with motivation, focus and a few clever tricks, our minds can do rather extraordinary things.\\"  References  Category:Mnemonics Category:2011 non-fiction books Category:Books about memory Category:Popular science books Category:Penguin Books books ","title":"Moonwalking with Einstein"},{"id":"33159865","text":"Let It Go is the third studio album by jazz pianist Josh Nelson.

It was located next to Mildura Airport and ran along a section of the Sturt Highway. At the time, the six-kilometre long circuit was the fastest in Australia with an average speed of around 160-kilometres per hour and a main straight exceeding 1.6-kilometres in length. The first race on the circuit was held on 26 December 1954, and was known as the Australian Road Race Grand Prix. Before the race could be held, the local council had to tar the back roads and create a hairpin to join them to the main straight. The hairpin became known as 'Taylor's Mistake' after a council road foreman originally constructed the hairpin fifty yards short of its intended location and the corner had to be relaid. The circuit hosted its final race on Boxing Day in 1956. The Australian Olympic TT had originally been planned to be held at Little River near Melbourne but due to police refusing to sanction the event, it was moved to Mildura. As the organisers were finding it more and more difficult to pay for events, they decided to no longer hold meetings at the circuit after 1956. The final laps of the track were completed in 1970 when motorcyclist Bill Cowey rode around the track in a demonstration event.

It signified to many in the Israeli public a deterioration to their personal security at that time.  The murder  On Thursday, December 8, 1983, the 14-year-old Israeli Danny Katz, a resident of the Denia neighborhood of Haifa, left his house to visit a friend, but disappeared en route.

Students create games and use various other simulated environments to capture consumers’ subconscious thoughts. This innovative method of market research removes the sensitization effect that might bias peoples answers to questions. This ensures that the most truthful answers are captured to research questions. The games are designed in such a way that the observers can elicit all the required information just by observing and noting down the behaviour and the responses of the participants. INDEX is primarily a fair conducted in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, which provides the people of the city an opportunity to experience the elements of a mela. Apart from the market research, the fair also attracts crowds through various innovative and interactive entertainment forums such as song and dance events, games, competitions and the many local vendors displaying their goods and services at the ground. The carnival atmosphere generates enthusiasm among the crowd, which leads to a more comprehensive research opportunity for the students to understand market insights in a live environment.  History and inception  The first INDEX was organized in 1994, with students and professors of Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow coming up with a solution to the sensitization effect that affects normal market researches and surveys. Market Research is constantly riddled with issues like the sensitization effect of the survey on the audience making the results of the survey occasionally unreliable. Often, the results of the survey fail to reflect the buying behavior of the consumers. Students and professors of Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow came up with a solution to these issues in the year 1994. INDEX is a marketing event where the information sought through the questionnaires is disguised in the form of games, which the respondents play. The respondents think they are just participating in some elaborate skit, and they subconsciously reveal the true options they would have chosen under natural circumstances. The games are designed in such a way that the observers can elicit all the required information just by observing and noting down the behaviour and the responses of the participants. It began as an in-campus event involving staff and faculty families as respondents but since 2001 it has entered into Lucknow city where a fair is organized for the general public. The concept behind this is called Disguised Experimentation. It is a method of obtaining information from the respondents, where both the respondent and the surveyor have immense take-away from the questioning: the respondent has fun and not a feeling of being interrogated, while the researcher gets data that can be classified as genuine.  Events  Although INDEX is aimed at providing a platform for market research, it is more than a marketing event. It has provided an opportunity for Lucknow residents to come forward and showcase their talents in various fields. Its popularity has attracted a large footfall which has been consistently increasing annually. The fair is designed to provide avenues of interest for all visitors to the fair. Events that have been conducted over the past years include book fairs and science exhibitions by students from the various schools in Lucknow. For the youth of the city, competitions such as “Fashion Parade” and “Choreo Nite”, with an opportunity for ramp walkers to win the title of Mr. and Miss. Index, have been organized over the years. Other events which are open for the public included numerous \\"Ek Minute\\" games, kids' dance competitions, \\"Bollywood quizzes\\" and \\"Salsa Performances\\". Food festivals offering different cuisine at the fair, in association with various outlets, are set up at INDEX aimed at the participants, students and families who visit. The fair also provides gala entertainment offerings with Star Nite performances by artists in the evening of the two days. Entertainers who have visited INDEX include Pt. Hari Prasad Chaurasia, Sufi singers \\"Mehfil-e-Sufiyana\\", and other artistes from Lucknow.  Initiatives  Throughout its years of activities INDEX has played host to a variety of social initiatives. IIM Lucknow, through INDEX has associated with NGOs such as Mahila Samkhya, and Prithvi Innovations which organised a puppet show during the fair. Various social awareness programs have also been addressed through its publicity mediums. Public issues which have been handled at the fair and its social initiative activities include Road Safety events and HIV awareness drives in association with UPSACS (Uttar Pradesh State AIDS Control Society). Colleges from across Lucknow participate in the street play competition \\"Jaagran\\", organised at locations in the City to promote social awareness.  Associates and sponsors  INDEX is a part of the unique market research initiative which is based on the concept of \\"Disguised Market Research\\" - which seeks to gain insights into the consumer's perspectives/needs through intelligently designed games to overcome the 'Sensitization Effect'. As a result, IIML's clients spread across the FMCG, Banking, Services and IT sectors and many Industry heavy weights in various sectors . Prominent market leaders which have associated with the fair and the college include Pepsi, Nokia, Cadbury, Aditya Birla Group, Viacom18, HT Media, Star India, Mahindra Group, Reckitt Benkiser, HUL, ITC, Johnson&Johnson;, P&G; and TATA Group.

First broadcast on BBC One on 25 December 2011, it is the seventh Doctor Who Christmas special since the show's revival in 2005. It was written by Steven Moffat and directed by Farren Blackburn. Internationally, the special was shown on BBC America in the United States and on Space in Canada the same day as the British broadcast, with ABC1 in Australia showing it one day later. In the special, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) is the caretaker of recently widowed Madge Arwell (Claire Skinner) and her children Lily (Holly Earl) and Cyril (Maurice Cole) during their holiday vacation in 1941 England. The Doctor plans to take them on a treat to a snowy planet through a portal in a present he has placed under the Christmas tree, but Cyril opens it before Christmas and wanders through. While looking for him, the others learn that the trees of the planet are about to be melted down with acid rain for energy. \\"The Doctor, the Widow, and the Wardrobe\\" marked the end of Piers Wenger's tenure as executive producer, and the debut of Caroline Skinner in the same position. Adapting elements of C.S. Lewis's children's novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Moffat intended the episode to be the most \\"Christmassy\\" of the Doctor Who Christmas specials, while Blackburn felt there was \\"magic\\" in it. It was filmed in September and October 2011, with some scenes taking place in an authentic Lancaster bomber. \\"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\\" was watched by 10.77 million viewers in the United Kingdom, making it the third most-watched programme on Christmas Day. Critical reception to the episode was positive, though some felt that the high-profile comedic guest stars Bill Bailey and Arabella Weir were underused. Plot =Prequel= On 6 December 2011, a prequel to the episode was released online. The Eleventh Doctor is seen on a spaceship holding a red button which, when he lets go, will cause the space ship to explode. While holding the button, he has phoned the TARDIS to speak to Amy asking her to rescue him, although he does not have his co-ordinates, Amy cannot fly the TARDIS, and she is not on the TARDIS. The Doctor wishes Amy a Merry Christmas before letting go of the button, and the spaceship explodes. =Synopsis= In England on Christmas Eve 1941, the Doctor becomes caretaker to Madge Arwell and her children, Lily and Cyril, as a favour to Madge for helping the Doctor find his TARDIS. Madge has received a telegram that the children’s father Reg disappeared over the English Channel a few days earlier, but decides not to tell her children yet, hoping to keep their spirits up through the holiday. The wood creatures, as they appear at the Doctor Who Experience. That night, Cyril is lured into opening a large glowing present under the Christmas tree, revealing a time portal to a snow-covered forest. The Doctor shortly discovers Cyril's absence and follows him with Lily; they eventually track Cyril to a strange lighthouse-like structure. Madge, finding her children missing, soon follows them into the forest, but is met by three miners in space suits. The miners tell Madge that the forest of the planet they are on is scheduled to be melted by acid rain within minutes, killing anything within it. At the lighthouse, Cyril is met by a humanoid creature made of wood; it places a simple band of metal around his head like a crown. Lily and the Doctor arrive, followed by another wood creature, but find the creatures have rejected Cyril as he is \\"weak\\", as they do the Doctor. The Doctor concludes that the life forces of the trees in the forest are trying to escape through a living creature, with the crown acting as an interface. Madge safely reunites with her children as the acid rain starts. The wood creatures identify her as \\"strong\\", and the Doctor realises they consider her the \\"mothership\\", able to carry the life force safely. Donning the band, Madge absorbs the life force of the forest, allowing her to direct the top of the lighthouse as an escape pod away from the acid rain and into the time vortex. Reg’s plane follows the light of the pod through the time vortex and safely arrives outside the house at Christmas, reuniting Reg with his family. The life force of the forest have converted themselves to ethereal beings within the time vortex. Believing that Amy and Rory still think he is dead, the Doctor joins them for Christmas dinner. Production The Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre's preserved Lancaster bomber Just Jane, used in the programme \\"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\\" was written by head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat, who wanted it to be \\"the most Christmassy Christmas special ever\\". He stated that \\"nothing is more fun to write\\" than the Doctor at Christmas, as he considered it \\"his kind of day. Everything's bright and shiny, everybody's having a laugh, and nobody minds if you wear a really stupid hat\\". The story is partly inspired by The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (from The Chronicles of Narnia) by C. S. Lewis. Moffat said that Doctor Who and the Narnia stories \\"come from the same impulse that children have of escaping to another world.\\" The scene in which the Doctor is showing the Arwells around the house originally included a scene in a \\"haunted coal cellar\\". The characters of Ven-Garr and Billis are named after outgoing executive producers Piers Wenger and Beth Willis, both of whom served with Moffat. The three tree harvesters are from Androzani Major in the year 5345, a planet which features in the serial The Caves of Androzani (1984). The Doctor mentions the Forest of Cheem, which appeared in the Ninth Doctor episode \\"The End of the World\\". He mentions that one of them fancied him, and during that episode one sacrificed her life for him. Several costumes and creatures in the episode, the spacesuit from the start of the episode, the Wooden Queen and King, and the Harvest Ranger costumes, on display at the Doctor Who Experience. \\"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\\" marks the debut of Caroline Skinner and sees the end of Wenger as executive producers. The two had previously worked together; Moffat commented it \\"will be the smoothest hand-over we've done\\". The special was directed by Farren Blackburn, who had previously worked with Skinner on The Fades. Blackburn stated that he was \\"daunted, thrilled and excited at the same time\\" about the job and that it was \\"tough\\". Blackburn's favorite sequences to direct was the opening sequence and the scenes set on the winter planet, where he \\"really felt like [he] was making a movie\\". When asked about the tone he wished to create, Blackburn replied, The BBC announced in September 2011 that production had started for the special and filming was due to be complete by mid October 2011. Filming was disrupted on 30 September due to a 24-hour protest at BBC Wales because of compulsory redundancies. The opening sequence set in the corridors of a spaceship was filmed on 20 September 2011 at Uskmouth Power Station. As the conditions were very noisy, the crew had to wear ear protectors. Filming of some scenes involving Alexander Armstrong took place in and around the Lancaster bomber Just Jane at the Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre on 3 October 2011. External footage of the lighthouse building took place in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. Actor Matt Smith stated, \\"It was a really tough shoot. Out in a forest, at night, and because there were children involved, some shooting schedules had to change radically, we'd often have to shoot through, no breaks – you get lunch at midnight or something.\\" =Casting= Alexander Armstrong was a regular on the Doctor Who spin-off The Sarah Jane Adventures as the voice of alien computer Mr Smith. Mr Smith appeared in Doctor Who in the crossover episodes \\"The Stolen Earth\\" and \\"Journey's End\\". Paul Kasey is credited as the Wooden Queen; Kasey has appeared in many Doctor Who episodes as various monsters, including Ood Sigma in \\"The End of Time\\", Nephew in \\"The Doctor's Wife\\", and a Cyberman in \\"Closing Time\\". Doctor Who Magazine, in its preview of the special, refers to as Madge, Cyril and Lily as companions, with nine- year-old Maurice Cole's Cyril Arwell defined as the youngest companion in the history of the franchise. Arabella Weir previously appeared as an alternate incarnation of the Third Doctor in the Doctor Who Unbound audio drama Exile. Weir was \\"genuinely surprised and completely thrilled\\" to be offered the part. Bill Bailey was pleased to be given a comedic human character, explaining, \\"The fact that I am almost playing a human means the expressions are easier to do. If I was an Ood, with a face full of tentacles, that would have been harder to bring the funny\\". Broadcast and reception \\"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 25 December 2011, Christmas Day, on BBC One and on the same date on BBC America in the United States, and Space in Canada. In Australia it was shown on 26 December on ABC1. In the UK, overnight ratings showed that the special was watched by 8.9 million, coming in fourth for Christmas Day. The final consolidated rating was 10.77 million viewers, ranking Doctor Who third for both Christmas Day and the entire week.Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e December 19–25, 2011\\", listed under BBC1 On BBC's online iPlayer, \\"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\\" was watched 434,000 times by 6 January 2012. The special received an Appreciation Index of 84. =Critical reception= The special received positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an approval rating of 100% based on 6 reviews, and an average score of 8.5/10. Dan Martin of The Guardian noted that it was \\"the smallest – yet perhaps the most enchanting – Christmas special we've had to date\\". Noting that it featured a typical \\"doomed spaceship\\", the threat was not to the universe but one family's happiness, and the only enemies were \\"some misguided and underdeveloped polluters\\", he concluded that \\"Any other time of year I would gnaw holes all over this, but it's Christmas, and today it felt perfect\\". He felt that Claire Skinner held the episode together and the appearance of Amy \\"made Christmas all the more special\\". However, his \\"major niggle\\" was that everything was the Doctor's fault, as he left the present while knowing that most children would open their presents before Christmas. Michael Hogan, writing for The Telegraph, gave the special four and a half out of five stars. He thought that the cast of comedians were \\"rather under-utilised\\" but thought that Skinner \\"excelled\\" and Smith was also \\"brilliant\\". Neela Debnath of The Independent described the episode as \\"the perfect recipe for a Christmas special\\", particularly praising the touching moments. In the same paper's DVD review, Ben Walsh gave \\"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\\" four out of five stars, calling it \\"best Doctor Who Christmas Special for some years\\". He commented that \\"the eco-message is a bit laboured, but the central tragedy that powers this scatty episode is a poignant one\\". Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern was pleased, despite noting that he had low expectations for the special. He particularly praised Smith's performance, although he noted that the \\"heart-warming\\" scene with Amy and Rory called for a \\"companions shake-up\\" next series. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave \\"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\\" an A-, feeling that it could stand proudly beside \\"A Christmas Carol\\", the previous Christmas special. IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode an 8 out of 10, calling it more \\"classically, indulgently, infectiously Christmassy\\" than the previous Christmas specials. He praised the production design and special effects teams for \\"creating some dazzlingly memorable special effects, and a winter wonderland that was both recognisably, fuzzily Christmas incarnate and unerringly, tensely alien\\" but thought the supporting cast \\"triumphed above and beyond\\" the plot devices. Like Hogan, Risley commented that the comedian cast of Bailey and Weir as well as Armstrong \\"felt lacking\\". However, the next year, Risley wrote that he \\"got a little carried away with the festive funtimes ... On reflection, the overwhelming Christmassyness of it all was overcompensating for a pretty flimsy, frivolous plot.\\" Nick Setchfield of SFX gave the special four out of five stars, praising Smith's acting and Blackburn's Doctor Who directing debut as well as the special effects. However, he thought that the lack of a villain was an \\"interesting experiment, but maybe not ideal for Christmas Day\\" and Bailey and Weir's forest rangers \\"felt like bolt-on comic relief\\". =DVD release= \\"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\\", along with its prequel, received a stand-alone DVD and Blu-ray release on 12 January 2012. Both are also included in the Doctor Who Complete Seventh Series box set. The ten Christmas specials between \\"The Christmas Invasion\\" and \\"Last Christmas\\" inclusive were released in a box set titled Doctor Who – The 10 Christmas Specials on 19 October 2015. Soundtrack Selected pieces of score from \\"The Doctor, the Widow, and the Wardrobe\\" and the following Christmas special, as composed by Murray Gold, were included on a soundtrack released on 21 October 2013 by Silva Screen Records.

It is the only species in the genus Pappea.  Common names  Common names include Jacket plum, Indaba tree and bushveld cherry. In other languages, it is known as: ' (Afrikaans); ', ', ' (Zulu); ', ' (Xhosa); ', ' (Pedi); ' (Swati); ', ' (Tsonga). Description Trunk of a large specimen growing in a bush clump The jacket plum (small to medium tree with a height of ) is a long-lived, hardy, evergreen. The greenish flowers are borne on catkins in the axils of the leaves. Pappea capensis is monoecious with flowers going through a distinct male phase followed by an equally distinct female phase. The trees flower from September to May and the fruit is produced from February to July. The dense crown is popular with nesting birds as it provides good nesting sites. The fruit are furry green capsule diameter that splits to yield an orange-red flesh containing a single black seed. The red fruit is eaten by birds, animals and humans. The jacket plum is related to the litchi. The leaves are alternate, simple and oblong, hard-textured and wavy. The leaves are crowded at the ends of the branches The leaf margin changes from sharply toothed young growth to almost smooth in mature leaves. Distribution Pappea is widespread in southern Africa from the Northern Cape through the drier Karoo, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and northwards into Botswana and Zambia. It is found in bushveld, riverine thicket, wooded grassland and rocky outcrops in grassland as well as scrub veld and is often found on termite mounds. History and significance =Origin of name= The generic name Pappea is named after the German physician and plant collector Karl Wilhelm Ludwig Pappe; the specific name ' refers to southern Africa. Other representatives of the family in South Africa are the false currants (Allophylus spp.), the sand olive (Dodonaea viscosa) and the bushveld red- balloon (Erythrophysa transvaalensis). This previously known separate varieties (Pappea capensis var. capensis and P. capensis var. radlkoferii) are now widely accepted as regional variation with two forms; an arid form from drier areas and a more lush form from regions of higher rainfall. Lobengula's Indaba tree is an old example of this tree, it is found at the state house in Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. =Ecology= Imago of the purple-brown hairstreak (Hypolycaena philippus) attracted to the nectar The fruit is eaten by various frugivorous birds and animals which in turn distribute the seeds in their droppings. The leaves are browsed by game such as elephant, giraffe, kudu, nyala, bushbuck, grey duiker and domestic stock animals. The jacket plum is recorded as larval food of the following butterflies of southern Africa: *Common hairtail butterfly (Anthene definita) *Brown playboy butterfly (Virachola antalus) *Pearlspotted charaxes (Charaxes jahlusa) *Gold-banded forester (Euphaedra neophron) The sweetly scented flowers attract a wide variety of insects and birds. The seed is parasitised by a small, bright red bug (Leptocoris hexophtalma) which sucks the oil from the seed on the ground below the tree. =Uses and cultural aspects= The delicious and very juicy fruit with a tart flavour is used to make preserve, jelly, vinegar and an alcoholic drink. Leaves, bark and the oil extracted from the seed are used medicinally against baldness, ringworm, nosebleeds, chest complaints, eye infections, and venereal disease. Bark is also used in protective charms that are sprinkled on the ground. Some research has reported that the leaves are very effective in killing snails. Infusions of the bark are also used by Kenyan Maasai warriors to gain courage as well as an aphrodisiac and a blood- strengthening tonic. The root is used orally or as an enema and as a purgative for cattle. The wood is hard, light brown with a reddish tint, tough and heavy with a twisted grain. There is little difference between the heartwood and the sapwood. The stems seldom attain significant girth and therefore do not yield much usable wood. This tree is used as an important source of herbal medicine.

The idea may have come from the Italians themselves, as the Arabic- language broadcasts received from Radio Bari in southern Italy were very popular in the Middle East and North Africa, where British and French influence was predominant and where they soon acquired an attentive and interested audience in the local upper middle class. The BBC's Italian- language broadcasts began with the Munich crisis. With the outbreak of hostilities in 1939, Radio London's broadcasts increased, reaching 4.15 hours in 1943. The success of Radio London's broadcasts was because the British War Office, instead of managing their propaganda broadcasts directly, had entrusted them to a self-governing body, the BBC, which was already well known for its independent journalistic style, with news kept separate from comments. Radio London's editorial staff became famous for their timeliness in transmitting information around the world, with a direct and pragmatic, typically British style. The BBC Italian Service was marked by the charismatic personality of Colonel Harold Stevens - famous in Italy as Colonnello Buonasera (in English Colonel Good Evening) - a British military officer who had lived in Rome and who, through his calm and reasonable comments, very different from Fascist rhetoric, conveyed a sense of serenity and hope in the future. \\"Candidus\\" (the pseudonym of John Marus) was another charismatic figure of Radio London, who, with his relentless dialectical skills, contrasted the attempts of Nazi-Fascist propaganda to distort the reality and seriousness of the situation. Radio London's role in the war also became crucial in sending special messages, drafted by the Allied High Command, for Italian resistance groups. Radio London's broadcasts were opened by the first notes of Beethoven's 5th Symphony (probably because they represented the letter \\"V\\" in Morse code, which evoked the idea of \\"V\\" for \\"Victory\\", also strongly associated with the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill). The BBC continued its broadcasts in Italian with a nightly programme called L'Ora di Londra (London's Hour) until 31 December 1981, when it was cut, despite the protests of many listeners. At least one hundred thousand Italians had apparently retained the habit of listening to the BBC until then.

Activities NISEA aims to fulfill its mission through three core programs that focus on education, empowerment and structural change. =Ending Armed Violence Program= The Ending Armed Violence Program focuses on making communities safer through an in depth understanding of why armed violence occurs, as well as strengthening a peace community that advocates an end to armed violence. NISEA has participated actively in various peace advocacies aiming to ban land mines, render the misuse and proliferation of arms and its impact on communities, change people's perception and behavior toward violence, engage non-state armed groups in the areas of Human Rights and International humanitarian law, seek assistance for victims and survivors of armed violence, and propagate a culture of peace. In relation to stopping the use and proliferation of small arms in Thailand, NISEA had: ::#Worked closely with other Non-governmental organizations (NGO)s and civil societies of countries to unravel and identify the presence and/or use of small arms during disappearance incidences. ::#Coordinated the Million Faces Campaign and took the lead in gathering photos and signatures to support an Arms Trade Treaty. ::# Worked with Amnesty International Thailand and the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace of Thailand on the Million Faces Campaign Despite efforts made to tackle the issues of armed violence in Thailand, it was reported in 2010 that death due to armed conflicts remained prevalent of about a loss of 4000 lives. =Reclaiming Rights Program= Reclaiming Rights Program seeks to empower the marginalized through campaigning, networking, and solidarity work. Currently, NISEA is concerned with the conflict in Southern Thailand and is involved in creating spaces for civil society actors to have greater participation in promoting peaceful means to end violence. It also facilitates discussion and encourages suggestions with regular reports on national security issues published on its website. =Nonviolence in Action Program= Nonviolence in Action Program seeks to draw lessons and best practices to enhance capacities through education, training, and multi-media resource material development, as it believes that every individual and community has an inherent capacity to handle and prevent armed conflicts nonviolently.

Melton worked as a cellar hand at Krondorf Wines between 1974 and 1976, before moving to Saltram Wines to work with Andrew Wigan and Peter Lehmann. In 1979 Saltram was sold to Seagram and Melton followed Lehmann to work at the newly established Peter Lehmann Wines. Melton continued work at Peter Lehmann Wines until 1986 when he and his wife Virginia established Charles Melton Wines. Charles Melton has been credited as \\"single-handedly reviving the grenache grape in Australia\\". On 20 October 2007, Melton was inducted into the \\"Barons of the Barossa\\", an organisation that recognises people that have made a significant contribution to the Barossa Valley wine community. Wines About 15,000 cases of wine are produced each vintage. The best known wine produced by Charles Melton is the Nine Popes. It is a blend of Grenache, Shiraz and Mourvedre. The first vintage of this wine was produced in 1988, and it was the first GSM blend made in the Barossa Valley.

Overview  The initial idea of works on MDI, was the application of model-driven methods and techniques for solving interoperability problems from business level down to data level. The three main ideas of Model Driven Interoperability (MDI) approach are: # Interoperability should be achieved at different levels: Business, Knowledge, Application and Data. # The main idea is to follow a Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approach. Therefore, it is promoted a systematic use of models as primary engineering artefacts throughout the engineering life cycle combined with both Domain Specific Modelling Languages and transformation engines and generators. # The use of ontologies and semantic annotations is needed in order to perform model transformation from enterprise level to code level. Interoperability levels.  History  MDI was initiated in 2004 with the beginning of two important research projects: * INTEROP NoE (Interoperability Research for Networked Enterprises Applications and Software Network of Excellence, FP6-IST 508011). * ATHENA IP (Advanced Technologies for interoperability of Heterogeneous Enterprise Networks and their Applications Integrated Project) (FP6-IST-507849). Both projects supported by the European Commission. These two projects worked on both the definition of a methodological framework and the application of MDI on concrete cases.  MDI Topics  = MDI Framework (INTEROP NoE) = MDI Framework within INTEROP is defined: * From conceptual point of view: providing a Reference Model in which is proposed an Interoperability Model defined at different levels of abstraction. * From methodological point of view: providing the Model Driven Interoperability (MDI) Method as a method (principle and structure) to enable interoperable Enterprise Software Applications (ESA), starting from the level of the Enterprise Model rather than from the code level and using a model- driven approach, combined with use of ontologies and semantic annotations. * From technological point of view: providing vertical and horizontal semantic support in order to perform model transformations.  The Reference Model  The Reference Model proposed for the MDI approach shows the different kinds of models that it is possible to perform at different levels of abstraction, and the successive model transformations that are needed to carry out. Reference Model for MDI. The different levels of abstraction are needed in order to make possible model transformations reducing the gap existing between enterprise models and code level. The definition of the several levels was based on the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) that defines three levels of abstraction: CIM, PIM and PSM. Moreover, we introduced a partition of the CIM level into two sub-levels in order to reduce the gap between the CIM and PIM levels. An Interoperability Model has been also defined at the different levels of abstraction proposed above. One example of this Reference Model for MDI can be see in the next figure. This picture shows in each of the proposed levels the different kind of models that can be performed (GRAI at Top CIM level, and UML in the other levels), and the final objective of making interoperable two ESA, the franchisor's ERP and the franchisee's CRM. Example of Reference Model for MDI.  Model Driven Interoperability Method  Model Driven Interoperability Method (MDI Method) is a model-driven method that can be used for two enterprises that need to interoperate not only at the code level but also at Enterprise Modelling level with an ontological support with the final aim of improving their performances. * It uses model transformations to achieve interoperability defining models and an Interoperability Model at different levels of abstraction according to an MDA approach and dividing the CIM level into two sub-levels, that is to say, Top CIM level (TCIM) and Bottom CIM level (BCIM). * It uses a Common Ontology to support these transformations and to solve interoperability problems at the semantic level. The MDI Method proposed to solve interoperability problems, like its name indicates, is based on the MDA approach. Also, the following principles were applied to the definition of this method: * The MDI Method is organised as an iterative process like Unified Process (UP) and other Object- Oriented Processes. * The MDI Method also proposes semantic support like Semantic of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR). Next picture show the main features of the MDI Method, in which the green areas give the estimated effort related to each phase and workflow: * Its main phases, represented on the columns: they describe four phases corresponding to the passage from one level of abstraction to a lower one. * Its main workflows, especially the three process workflows related to the three main components of the MDI method: the Interoperability Model, the Common Interoperability Ontology and the Model Transformation. MDI Method. = MDI Framework (ATHENA IP) = The MDI Framework from ATHENA provides guidance on how MDD should be applied to address interoperability. The framework is structured in three main integration areas: * Conceptual integration, which focuses on concepts, metamodels, languages and model relationships. It provides us with a foundation for systematising various aspects of software model interoperability. * Technical integration, which focuses on the software development and execution environments. It provides us with development tools for developing software models and execution platforms for executing software models. * Applicative integration, which focuses on methodologies, standards and domain models. It provides us with guidelines, principles and patterns that can be used to solve software interoperability issues.  Conceptual integration  The reference model for conceptual integration has been developed from a MDD point of view focusing on the enterprise applications and software system. MDI: Reference Model for conceptual integration. According to MDA, a Computation Independent Model (CIM) corresponds to a view defined by a computation independent viewpoint. It describes the business context and business requirements for the software system(s). A Platform Independent Model (PIM) corresponds to a view defined by a platform independent viewpoint. It describes software specifications independent of execution platforms. A Platform Specific Model (PSM) corresponds to a view defined by a platform specific viewpoint. It describes the realisation of software systems.  Technical integration  Technical Integration reference model promotes the use of service-oriented solutions where a software system and more generally a system provide a set of services required by the businesses and users of the enterprise. MDI: Reference Model for technical integration.  Applicative integration  The reference model for applicative integration has been developed in order to emphasise the dependencies between the different models and views to achieve interoperability. MDI: Reference model for applicative integration. = Model Transformations = Model transformation is one of the key approaches used to support the MDI Method. This approach is used in both horizontal and vertical dimension of the Reference Model for MDI. All model transformations performed are based on to the generic transformation architecture. Transformation Architecture. = Semantic Support = The following services: verification of the consistency of models, support to automatic mapping discovery among heterogeneous models, and definition of semantic preserving transformation can support MDI to tackle both vertical and horizontal issues. Vertical issues: semantic support aiming at: * Giving a logic-based formalization of portions of models via semantic annotations easing reuse, cross-reference, and unambiguous terminology. * Tracing the changes (among the different layers of MDD transformations). * Formalizing the delta-knowledge used in semantic enriching transformations (i.e. the transformations from more abstract models to more detailed ones). Horizontal issues: semantic support aiming at: * Performing semantic mismatches analysis among the models of different enterprises. * Representing model correspondences across enterprises through semantic annotations. * Creating reconciliation rules for performing data, service and business process reconciliation.

The building in 1932.  Radio Bari during the Fascist Regime  By decision of the Fascist regime, in 1934 Radio Bari started to broadcast propaganda and counter-propaganda programmes, accompanied by music and political commentaries, for listeners in Arabic-speaking countries. These broadcasts, aired at regular intervals from 10.30 a.m. until 3 a.m., were received throughout the Mediterranean basin, reaching countries including Egypt, Palestine, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco, where British or French influence was at that time predominant. A few months later, the station also began to broadcast in the Greek language. The months that followed saw a true radio war, which lasted throughout World War II, including jamming of radio signals, between the Axis and Allied radio stations.  Radio Bari during the Resistance  On 8 September 1943, the Bari transmitter, one of the few still operating in southern Italy, was peacefully occupied by a group of local intellectuals politically close to the philosopher Benedetto Croce together with groups of anti-fascists, republicans, democrats and activists of the Action Party. With the help of some radio technicians, they were able to transmit on 11 September the first message of the King of Italy, Victor Emanuel III, after his departure from Rome. Radio Bari was thus able to broadcast the first broadcast of free Italy. Starting from 23 September 1943, the premises of Radio Bari were occupied by the Americans who immediately made it the organ of their headquarters in Algiers. The core programme was Italia combatte (Italy fights on) in which, while complying with the directives of the Allied Command, the speakers targeted the public opinion of southern Italy with interesting features full of news and testimonies from the front, as well as on guerrilla actions, together with information for partisans and anti- fascist propaganda. These political programmes were supported by \\"a lot of music for which an entire record store was seized\\".

Her maternal grandfather, Walter Steadford Mitchell served in the 11th Light Horse regiment during World War I. Equestrian career Meg Wade was the first person to win, four times, the Southern Hemisphere’s premier 100 mile (160 km) endurance race, the Tom Quilty Gold Gup. Meg Wade grew up on her parents farm at Wallacia, New South Wales and began riding at an early age, competing at local pony clubs and shows. She was educated at Presbyterian Ladies College, Sydney, and at Hawkesbury Agricultural College and later qualified as a helicopter pilot. She began competing in endurance equestrian events in 1988 on ‘Quillionaire’ a thoroughbred she had bred and raised herself, but then began to ride Arabians. She subsequently completed in sixty-three one-day 160 km competitions and won twenty-four of them. Wade has been ‘Australian Endurance Rider of the Year’ ten times and has thrice won team bronze medals at World Championships and an individual 4th placing at the 2002 World Championships. On numerous occasions she has competed on behalf of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Prime Minister and Vice-President of the United Arab Emirates. After she married, she moved to ‘Dingley Maze’, a 2,200 acre property at Burrowye in the Shire of Tallangata in Victoria where she and her husband, Chris Gates, raised Angus beef cattle. She also established the Castlebar Arabian Stud with a foundation breeding stock of 20 competition horses. Riding Accident and Recovery On Easter Sunday, 2009, while competing in a 100 kilometre ride at Tumbarumba she was thrown from her horse and was critically injured with a fractured skull. She was subsequently airlifted to Canberra Hospital in a coma. Although she eventually regained consciousness, she spent nine months in Epworth Hospital in Melbourne recovering from Acquired Brain Injury. Her medical expenses were paid by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Wade’s courageous struggle to walk and ride again was chronicled by Pip Courtney in a Landline feature broadcast on ABC Television on 1 August 2010.

THE QUESTIONING OF THE POWER OF THE WREADER The Argentine writer Belén Gache is by now well known for her experimental fiction—both online and offline—including net poetry, literary blogs, videopoesz'a and hypertext fictions\\" Of Spanish and Gibraltarian descent, she was born in Buenos Aires. She lives in Madrid. She graduated from the University of Buenos Aires where she was professor in narratology and literary theory. Her work has diversified into different literary forms. Departing from narrative, she became a pioneer of electronic literature producing since 1996 various forms of expanded and hypertextual writings. Narrative Identified with the postmodern literature movement, her novels are characterized by fragmentation, hyper-realism and the use of unreliable narrators. Influenced by minimalism and anti-novel, her fictions are written in first person and present tense by misfit and quasi-paranoid female protagonists. Her first novel Luna India (Indian Moon), was shortlisted in the Planeta Award Biblioteca del Sur, and was published in 1994. Her second novel Divina Anarquia(Divine Anarchy)(1999), deals with the lack of genealogy and the imaginary histories of the narrator. Lunas eléctricas para las noches sin luna (Electric moons for moonless nights)(2004) takes place in 1910, during the celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Argentine Independence, in a Buenos Aires whose population was mainly composed of European immigrants. In this context a detective plot with political connotations is developed, narrated from the point of view of a mythomaniac teenager daughter of Spaniards. Experimental and electronic literature In 1995, she created the group and website Fin del Mundo (End of the World), along with Gustavo Romano, Carlos Trilnick and Jorge Haro in Buenos Aires where she put online her first interactive poems. In 2002 she published El libro del fin del mundo. This physical book also contained a CD-ROM and links to complementary sections on the Internet. It combined pieces of poetry, visual poetry, electronic and multimedia poetry. In 2004, she published El blog del niño burbuja (The Bubleboy blog) one of the first experiments in fiction blogs. In 2006 she published on the Internet the WordToys, Wordtoys in NETescopioUniversity of Liverpool Wordtoys presentation an anthology of her net-poems produced between 1996 and 2006 and one of her most widely known pieces. Here she proposes the exercise of reading as a decoding task as well as a ludic activity. The fourteen net-poems in this anthology are rooted on the historical avant- gardes, using strategies as randomness, tautology, appropriations and are influenced by concrete and conceptual writing. A second collection made in 2011, Gongora WordToys, focuses on the figure of the Spanish Baroque poet Luis de Gongora deconstructing his masterpiece Soledades (Solitudes). Since 2013, she develops the Kublai Moon project, an example of \\"distributed literature\\" or \\"literature across networks\\", through different media (blogs, automatic poem generator, invented typography, Vimeo, and other platforms 2.0) a linguistic sci-fi saga that tells the story of the moon trip of the narrator's alter ego together with Commander Aukan and robot AI Halim.

History  =Creation= Emperor Charles I of Austria, after Foreign Minister Baron István Burián asked for an armistice based on the Fourteen Points on 14 October 1918, issued two days later a proclamation that radically changed the nature of the Austrian state. According to the Volkermanifest the Poles were granted full independence with the purpose of joining their ethnic brethren in Russia and Germany in a Polish state. To prevent the total collapse of the monarchy the rest of the Austrian lands were transformed into a federal union composed of four parts—German, Czech, South Slav and Ukrainian. Each of the four parts was to be governed by a federal council, and Trieste was to receive a special status. On the evening of the 28 October, Zoltán Jekelfalussy, the Hungarian governor of Fiume, called Mayor Antonio Vio to his office to give him the news that the Hungarian Government had decided that Fiume was to be abandoned both militarily and politically. The members of the Municipal Council knew they could no longer base its right to authority on his appointment by a power that no longer existed in its previous form. The Municipal Council invoking the right of self-determination, advocated by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson reappointed Vio as major and expanded its ranks to some 60 co-opted members. In the meanwhile the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs was officially instituted on 29 October 1918 in Zagreb. Representatives of the latter body arrived in the city and wrested command of the governor palace from Jekelfalussy who left the city. The city now had two self-proclaimed governments, each basing its claims on the same principle. The local representatives of the Municipal Council as a response formed immediately the Italian National Council, headed by Antonio Grossich. On 30 October the body proclaimed the annexation of Fiume to Italy =Italian occupation of Fiume in 1918= Austria-Hungary reached an armistice with Italy through the Armistice of Villa Giusti signed on November 3, 1918. This agreement stipulated that Italy could occupy large parts of the territory claimed by the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, formed during the dissolution of the Habsburg Monarchy. The National Council of the Slovenes, Croats and Serbs in Fiume was dissolved when Italian Army units, commanded by General Enrico di San Marzano, occupied the city. The rule of the Italian National Council was tolerated by the Italian command, much less so by the American, English and French units who also came to the city. =Unification with Italy= At the Paris peace Conference Andrea Ossoinack was entrusted by the Italian National Council as its official representative and in that capacity had a meeting with Wilson in April 1919. The Italian National Council functioned as a de facto government (with interruptions) during both the Italian Regency of Carnaro (1919–1920) and the Free State of Fiume (1920–1924). The city was annexed to Italy in February 1924, thereby ending its authority.

Biography Living in the house of a relation whose name Franz he adopted, he frequented the Academy of his native city, and afterwards the studio of Ludwig Richter. After he had gained the gold medal, he resided for some time in Munich, and in the spring of 1843 went as exhibitioner of the Dresden Academy to Rome, where he became a member of the Academy of St. Luke, and spent almost the entire remainder of his life. His study of Italian nature had the greatest influence on his works, and at the same time the impression made upon him by modern French landscape painters increased his desire to obtain a soft fusion of colours.

Plot Throughout the movie, the scene switches between the 'present' Bang providing the narration, and the flashback events of his past. While a servant, Bangja shares his rooms with Mr. Ma, a notorious womanizer and self-stylized Lothario. Bangja escorts his master (Mong-ryong) to an evening out at the local pleasure house, where they are witness to a performance by the madam's daughter Chunhyang. While trying to arrange a meeting between Chunhyang and his rather clumsy and socially awkward master, Bangja defends Mong-ryong from a larger, disgruntled patron and inadvertently impresses both Chunhyang and her maidservant Hyangdan. Mr. Ma begins to coach the simple, honest Bangja in the ways of seducing women, which Bang uses to secure a picnic outing for Mong-ryong with Chunhyang through Hyangdan. During the excursion, Bangja so astounds the ladies by cooking meat to perfection, recovering Chunhyang's slipper from the waterfall pool, and carrying her on his back after she injured her ankle, that a love triangle rapidly begins to form between the two women and Bangja, much to the consternation of Mong-ryong, though he boasts that he is slowly luring Chunhyang to him by playing hard to get. While his master continues to study, Bangja attempts to court Chunhyang. Mr. Ma continues to provide instruction to Bangja, assuaging his concerns when he thinks his master may have slept with her, and pushing him to seize upon spending the night with her before his master can. Though Bangja's seduction is clumsy and his approach very tentative, Chunhyang begins to fall for him and makes love to him on several occasions. Due to his low social-standing, however, she seeks to marry Mong- ryong and enlists Bangja's help in order to make this plan a reality. When Mong-ryong is called away to Seoul to finish studying and take his exam he asks Bangja to recover a written promise he gave Chunhyang about marrying her. She catches Bangja as he tries to steal the paper, and switches it for a confession letter she wrote and got him to sign the night the two of them first had sex. Mong-ryong reads the letter and dismisses Bangja from his service for having deceived him. Three years pass, and Bangja and Chunhyang grow closer and continue to love each other while Bangja becomes the servant of Chunhyang's house and runs errands for a local strong man. However, Chunhyang begins to take after her mother and grows increasingly manipulative despite her burgeoning love for Bangja. In Seoul, Mong-ryong takes his exams and becomes a Royal Inspector. After insulting the court eunuchs however, he is accorded a lowly position in his home town, subservient to the new governor. Mong-ryong finds Hyangdan has become the madam of her own house and runs a successful business. She sleeps with Mong-ryong and asks him if she is not more desirable and pleasing than Chunhyang, but expresses remorse that Bangja chose Chunhyang over her. Mong-ryong discusses women with his magistrate and later returns to Chunhyang's house. Mong-ryong goes for a walk with Chunhyang, and though it is not revealed what the two discussed, Chunhyang returns with a pleased expression and an expectation of seeing Mong- ryong again. The magistrate visits Chunhyang's house and after a confrontation with his own clerks and then Bangja, is greeted by a beautiful, but uncooperative Chunhyang who refuses to sit and pour his drinks because she is not a gisaeng. Enraged by her arrogance, the governor beats Bangja when he attempts to interfere, and has Chunhyang imprisoned. Bangja goes to Mong-ryong and implores his old master to help save her life. Later, during a celebration, the magistrate is seen in a back room attempting to sexually excite Chunhyang because Mong-ryong had told him that she would only bow to his wishes and fulfill his desires if he were violent with her. Bangja causes a commotion to get the magistrate to release her, but is saved from being beaten by the guards when Mong-ryong arrives with a large contingent of guards. Mong-ryong arrests the magistrate and has Chunhyang whipped for her insolence until Bangja interferes, claiming that she has a husband whom she was remaining faithful to. Chunhyang stabs herself with a small blade, saying to Mong-ryong (whose face was hidden) that she wanted news of her death taken to Master Lee Mong-ryong. Bangja is visited in his cell, first by Mr. Ma, who warns him to never beg a woman to stay, then by Chunhyang, who reveals that she and Mong-ryong planned the whole event after he returned from his exams. For the first time, Bangja confesses his love to Chunhyang. She then tells Mong-ryong that she will not leave without Bangja, and so the three of them depart the city together. When the trio stop at the waterfall where they had their first excursion years before, Mong-ryong pushes Chunhyang down the falls and she is seen face-down in the water. Bangja dives in to save her and runs away, carrying her on his back as he did when she injured her ankle. The 'present' Bangja tells the writer that he ran from Mong-ryong and his agents for a long time after those events. The last thing he does to bring the story to close is bring the writer to the back of his warehouse to see Chunhyang who survived the fall, but was left with brain damage and has 'become a child'. The writer declares that Bangja is an amazing man and will make him the hero of a wonderful story about a servant's love, but Bangja insists that the story be told with her fabricated fidelity being the truth, and Chunhyang living happily ever after with a Lee Mong-ryong who loved her and returned for her. When asked why, he says it was because it was something she never got to have, and he is happy with being the hero in his heart. Bangja requests one scene be written to demonstrate the love between the two characters, which he demonstrates by carrying Chunhyang around the room on his back and singing a variation of the song Sarangga from the pansori Chunhyangga while she smiles lovingly and snowflakes slowly fall on them from the open roof. The last scenes are of people in the village where they lived, the times when she entertained guests at her house with her singing, and of her shoe in the ice below the waterfall where he saved her.

First published in 2006, it is the second book in Gibbins's Jack Howard series. It has been published in more than 20 languages and was a New York Times bestseller. Plot summary Following a prologue set in AD 71 when the golden menorah from the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem is locked away in Rome, the novel picks up in present-day Turkey with marine archaeologist Jack Howard on a hunt for ancient treasures in the harbour of Istanbul, formerly Constantinople. One item not among the treasures thrown into the harbour when the Crusaders pillaged the city is the menorah, and Jack soon learns from colleagues Jeremy and Maria that it may have been stolen from Constantinople by Norse warrior Harald Hardrada during his service to the emperor of Constantinople and taken by him on his explorations of the New World. Jack goes to the monastery at Iona in Scotland to see a priest who tells him that the Nazi Ahnenerbe were on the trail of the menorah in the 1930s. The priest is found gruesomely murdered, showing that there are present-day Nazis who are shadowing them. In Greenland Jack and his friend Costas dive inside an iceberg, where they find a perfectly preserved Viking ship burial containing one of Hardrada's warriors. They go to L'Anse aux Meadows, the Viking site in Greenland, where further clues lead them to the Yucatán in Mexico, where Hardrada and his men had a final standoff with the Maya. After a perilous dive into a cenote, Jack discovers the truth of Hardrada's last stand and the fate of the menorah, and he has his own final standoff with the latter-day Nazi and his henchmen who have been following him. The book ends with a chapter-length Author's Note in which Gibbins details the historical and archaeological facts behind the fiction in the novel.

A pan language compiler transforms the configuration information contained within a set of pan templates to a machine-friendly XML or JSON format. The pan language is used within the Quattor toolkit to define the desired configuration for one or more machines. The language is primarily a declarative language where elements in a hierarchical tree are set to particular values. The pan syntax is human-friendly and fairly simple, yet allows system administrators to simultaneously set configuration values, define an overall configuration schema, and validate the final configuration against the schema.  Implementation  The compiler panc serves as the de facto reference implementation of the language and is implemented in Java, though at present it is not possible to execute the compiler with OpenJDK. A configuration is defined by a set of files, called templates, written in the pan language. These templates define simultaneously the configuration parameters, the configuration schema, and validation functions. Each template is named and is contained in a file having the same name. The syntax of a template file is simple: [ object  declaration  unique  structure ] template template-name; [ statement … ] These files may contain comments that start with the hash sign ('#') and terminate with the next new line or end of file.  Types  There are five primitive, atomic types in the pan language: * boolean * long * double * string * link There are two primitive collection types: * list (an ordered list/array of elements) * nlist (Named list associates a string key with a value, similar to hashes, dictionaries or associative arrays) Users can create new types built up from the primitive types with optional validation functions to enforce specific constraints for particular fields.  Template types  There are five different types of templates that are identified by the template modifier: = Ordinary templates = An ordinary template uses no template modifier in the declaration. These templates may contain any pan statement, but statements must operate only on absolute paths. = Object templates = Object templates can be thought of as the root of each generated XML configuration profile. The pan compiler will generate an XML profile for each processed object template. In all other respects, they are the same as ordinary templates. = Declaration templates = These templates may contain only those pan statements that do not modify the machine profile. A declaration template will only be executed once for each processed object template no matter how many times it is included. = Unique templates = A template defined with the unique modifier behaves like an ordinary template except that it will only be included once for each processed object template. = Structure templates = Structure templates are a convenient alternative for creating nlists and are used via the create function. A template declared with the structure modifier may only contain include statements and assignment statements that operate on relative paths. Any include statements may only reference other structure templates.

The United Nations then was synonymous with the Allies of World War II and Germany then being the Greater German Reich, a member of the Axis powers. With the war ending in the defeat of Germany, the country's territory was divided amongst the victors and what was to remain Germany was under Allied administration. In 1949, two new countries were created in these occupied territories: the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) in May and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in October. Both Germanies were admitted as full members of the United Nations (UN) on 18 September 1973. The two countries eventually merged on 3 October 1990, signifying an end of the Cold war era. Today, Germany is the third largest contributor to the UN budget, after the United States and Japan, with 190 million US dollars, or roughly 8% of the UN budget for the 2010-11 biennial budget.Germany's financial contributions to the United Nations, German Federal Foreign Office History Hoisting of the two German flags outside the UN building in New York on 18 September 1973 Flags of the two Germanys at the United Nations in 1973 The Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) was admitted to the UN as an observer in 1952. The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was admitted as an observer in 1972. On 18 September 1973 both were admitted as full members by the United Nations General Assembly, following the recommendation of the Security Council by Resolution 335 on 22 June 1973. Through the accession of the German Democratic Republic to the Federal Republic of Germany, it was effective on 3 October 1990. The territory of the German Democratic Republic became part of the Federal Republic of Germany, today simply known as Germany. Consequently, the Federal Republic of Germany continued being a member of the UN while the German Democratic Republic ceased to exist. 2011-2012 UNSC seat For the years of 2011 to 2012 Germany has been elected as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). However, Germany received criticism from its European and US allies for abstaining on the Libyan no-fly zone resolution that they were voting for. Former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer argued that \\"Germany has lost its credibility in the United Nations and in the Middle East. German hopes for a permanent seat on the Security Council have been permanently dashed and one is now fearful of Europe's future.\\"Fischer Joins Criticism of German Security Council Abstention, Spiegel OnlineGermany has marginalised itself over Libya, The Guardian Permanent UNSC seat France and the United Kingdom have explicitly called for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council for their close EU partner. French president Jacques Chirac said in a speech in Berlin in 2000 that \\"Germany's engagement, its ranking as a great power, its international influence—France would like to see them recognized with a permanent seat on the Security Council\\". The former German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, also identified Russia, among other countries, as a country that backed Germany's bid. Italy and the Netherlands on the contrary, suggest a common European Union (EU) seat in the Council instead of Germany becoming the third European member next to France and the UK. The former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said that Germany would also accept a common European seat; however, as long as France and the UK are not willing to give up their own seats, Germany should also have a seat. Thus, the German campaign for a permanent seat was intensified in 2004. Schröder made himself perfectly clear in August 2004: \\"Germany has the right to a seat.\\"\\"Germany Hopes for UN Security Council Seat Dampened\\", Deutsche Welle, 20 August 2004. Retrieved 14 May 2006. Its bid is supported by Japan, India, Brazil, France, the United Kingdom and Russia, among other countries. Current German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had initially been quiet on the issue, re-stated Germany's bid in her address to the UN General Assembly in September 2007. In July 2011, Merkel's trip to Kenya, Angola, and Nigeria was thought to be motivated, in part, by the goal of seeking support from African countries for Germany's bid for a permanent seat on the Security Council.

OSL is a transdisciplinary pedagogy that is dependent on the use of physically open spaces - in the sense that tables and chairs are absent - and an open approach to intellectual content and the role of the tutor. Participants in OSL, typically but not exclusively, learn in an 'embodied' way.Monk, Nicholas, Jonathan Heron, Jonathan Neelands, Carol Chillington Rutter. Open-space Learning: a Study in Interdisciplinary Pedagogy. London: Bloomsbury, 2011. Bloomsbury Interdisciplinary Studies in the Humanities. Print and Web. p.vi Origins The idea was to apply the practices and theories of the theatrical rehearsal room and the theatrical ensemble to the university curriculum. From these early aspirations developed a pedagogy that has now been used successfully in a dozen departments including Chemistry, Law, Business, English, Mathematics, Philosophy, and Medicine. OSL is a collaborative pedagogic practice and does not, therefore, have a single originator or author. Methods In OSL, the workshop is the fundamental activity of pedagogic interaction.http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/iatl/projects/osl- final/introduction/workshop_model/ Accessed 22 September 2011. Examples of OSL activities include 'still image' or 'tableau', in which participants embody sometimes abstract ideas; 'theory building', in which participants create a narrative, a concept, or a 'theory' from a collection of materials relating to a particular subject; and simulation and roleplay. Theory OSL employs methods such as ‘enactive’ learning, ‘kinaesthetic’ learning and the various styles of teaching developed by practitioners such as Augusto Boal and Paulo Freire. Theoretically the work owes its greatest debt to thinkers like Vygotsky, Howard Gardner, and David A. Kolb. In terms of the suggestion that it promotes a style of teaching and learning that seeks to undermine a Cartesian separation of mind and body, its greatest debt is to work in Neuroscience by academics such as Andy Clark, and to phenomenology of the kind developed by Husserl. OSL also has connections to ‘applied drama’, ‘applied theatre’, or ‘applied performance’. OSL can include any kind of learning in which the participants are required to engage with both mind and body in a workshop environment, and promotes a combination of 'mindfulness' and 'playfulness'.OSL website Technology OSL approaches are often dependent upon removing obstacles and mediations between bodies and minds. They can have a positively disruptive relationship to digital technologies. Where participants in challenging learning situations might ordinarily seek escape into the internet, OSL brings them back to a more immediate and unmediated presence. This has the potential to frame and question digitally-dependent habits, if handled carefully. Technology may then be reintroduced, carefully and with conscious awareness of potential effects, to extend the time and place in which OSL occurs and has effect.

Reverend Byrne was consecrated by Bishop James Murray in 1885 and served until his death in 1901. Early years and background Born in Dublin, Ireland to Patrick Byrne, and his wife, Maria, Byrne was educated in Dublin at St Lawrence O'Toole College (Hardcourt Street, Dublin) and Rouen Seminary where he was ordained a priest in 1865. Whilst at St Lawrence O'Toole College, he met Matthew Quinn. When Quinn was consecrated as the inaugural Catholic Bishop of Bathurst, Byrne volunteered to accompany Quinn to Australia aboard the Empress. Initially working as a priest in the Diocese of Bathurst, Byrne deputised in Murray's Diocese of Maitland during the latter's absence in Europe from 1869 to 1873. Returning to Bathurst in 1873, Byrne was instrumental in the establishment of Australia's first seminary in Bathurst, named in honour of St Charles Borromeo and in the formative years of St Stanislaus' College where he also served as President, from 1884 until 1885. Episcopate Modelled in the style of Quinn, his predecessor, Byrne built on the established foundations by adding churches in Gulgong, Coonamble and Stuart Town, and a convent at Wellington. In 1887 the Brigidine Sisters and in 1884 the Patrician Brothers provided a boost to teaching in the diocese. Byrne also established the St Vincent de Paul Society and in 1888 invited the Vincentian Fathers to take over St Stanislaus' College and St Charles' Seminary; the latter which was closed in 1896 after St Patrick's Seminary in Manly was opened in 1889. In 1875, Byrne sent Father John Dunne to Dubbo as parish priest and over a period of ten years helped him establish a brick church and the Convent of Mercy, which had day and boarding schools, before recalling him to Bathurst to administer the cathedral parish, supervising the construction of a Patrician Brothers' monastery and enlargement of the cathedral. Dunne eventually served as vicar- general from 1900, a role that Byrne had served under Quinn's direction. Byrne followed a similar pattern of rejecting the independence of the Josephite community, formed by Father Julian Tenison-Woods in conjunction with Mary MacKillop. Byrne barred Woods from exercising any further influence; destroying letters and records, and demoting him to the rank of episcopal confrère. Byrne favoured one of Tenison-Woods' graduates, a young geologist, John Milne Curran, who was ordained a priest in 1885. Byrne granted Curran permission to accept appointment as lecturer in geology and mineralogy at the Sydney Technical College and later as government geologist, before returning to Bathurst to edit the Catholic newspaper, The Record. Byrne also facilitated the establishment of the Diocese of Wilcannia-Forbes which was formed out of the Bathurst diocese. Byrne died of cancer, whilst serving in office as Catholic Bishop of Bathurst.

The company specialises in creating natural and expressive-sounding text to speech voices, synthesis voices with regional accents, and in voice cloning.  Voice building technology  CereProc creates voices using two different voice-building technologies: unit selection synthesis and parametric modelling. CereProc's unit selection voices are built from large databases of recorded speech. During database creation, each recorded utterance is segmented into some or all of the following: individual phones, syllables, morphemes, words, phrases, and sentences. The division into segments is done using a specially modified speech recogniser.Alan W. Black, Perfect synthesis for all of the people all of the time. IEEE TTS Workshop 2002. An index of the units in the speech database is then created based on the segmentation and acoustic parameters like the fundamental frequency (pitch), duration, position in the syllable, and neighbouring phones. At runtime, the desired target utterance is created by determining the best chain of candidate units from the database (unit selection). Unit selection provides the greatest naturalness, because it applies digital signal processing (DSP) to the recorded speech only at concatenation points. DSP often makes recorded speech sound less natural. CereProc's parametric voices produce speech synthesis based on statistical modelling methodologies. In this system, the frequency spectrum (vocal tract), fundamental frequency (vocal source), and duration (prosody) of speech are modelled simultaneously. Speech waveforms are generated from these parameters using a vocoder. Critically, these voices can be built from significantly less recorded speech than unit selection voices and have a much smaller footprint when installed, because of this they are used for private voice cloning.  Voices and languages  CereProc has forty-six generally available voices that speak fourteen languages in a number of different regional accents: *American English: Isabella, Katherine, Hannah, Megan, Adam, Nathan, Andy (child voice), Jordan (child voice), Carolyn *British English: Sarah, William, Jack, Lauren, Giles, Amy *Northern English: Jess *Scottish English: Heather, Kirsty, Stuart, Andrew (child voice), Mairi (child voice) *Glasgow English: Dodo *Lancashire English: Claire *Irish English: Caitlin *West Midlands English: Sue *Special FX voices: Demon, Ghost, Goblin, Pixie, Robot *Metropolitan French: Suzanne, Laurent *Canadian French: Florence *Catalan: Rita *Castilian Spanish: Sara *Latin American Spanish: Ana *Italian: Laura *Irish: Peig *Dutch: Ada *German: Gudrun, Alex *Austrian German: Leopold *Portuguese: Lúcia *Brazilian Portuguese: Gabriel *Japanese: Yuki *Scottish Gaelic: Ceitidh *Swedish: Ylva *Polish: Pola *Romanian: Daria *French-accented English: Nicole *Russian: Avrora *Mandarin: Mailin In addition, the company has developed a number of celebrity voices that are not generally available to the public. These include George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Voice cloning  In 2009, film critic Roger Ebert employed CereProc to create a synthetic version of his voice. Ebert had lost the power of speech following surgery to treat thyroid cancer. CereProc mined tapes and DVD commentaries featuring Ebert's voice to create a text-to-speech voice that sounded more like his own.Roger Ebert: The Essential Man \\"Esquire\\", February 16, 2010. Accessed: 9-21-2011 Roger Ebert used the voice in his March 2, 2010 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show. NFL player Steve Gleason had his voice cloned by CereProc following his diagnosis with MND. Gleason appeared in Microsoft's Super Bowl XLVIII commercial praising the power of technology, using his synthetic voice to narrate. CereProc voice cloning technology is currently being used in the UK by MND sufferers, to create synthesis voices before they lose the power of speech. This process was featured in a BBC Radio 4 documentary, Giving the Critic Back His Voice, broadcast in August 2011.\\"Giving the Critic Back His Voice\\". BBC Radio Scotland Programmes.

CereProc desktop voices are compatible with Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS X. They install as system voices and are able to be used by other speech-enabled applications. CereProc's client/server system cServer, aimed principally at the corporate IVR market, can be run on Windows and Linux. CereProc Mobile voices can be deployed on Android and Apple iOS.

After an early career as a schoolmaster and organist, he was engaged as a music critic by The Sunday Times in 1865. Within five years he was appointed chief music critic of The Daily Telegraph, a post he held from 1870 to 1906. Among Bennett's other work was writing or adapting libretti for cantatas and other large-scale orchestral and choral works by British composers such as Arthur Sullivan, Frederic Cowen and Alexander Mackenzie. Life and career =Early years= Bennett was born in Berkeley, Gloucestershire. He attended the local church, and became a member of its choir, and joined a local musical society in whose orchestra he played the viola.\\"Joseph Bennett\\", The Musical Times, Vol. 51, No. 814, 1 December 1910, pp. 769–772 When he reached the age of 18, his friends encouraged him to become a minister in the Congregational church, but after long consideration he decided that he could not accept all the doctrines of the church. He embarked instead on a career as a teacher, and studied for a year at a training college in London in 1853. After spending the following year in Margate, where he taught at the local school and played the organ in the Baptist church, Bennett was invited to take charge of a school in Islington, north London. He remained there for three years, before moving in 1857 to the Weigh House Chapel in the City of London as precentor and schoolmaster. He soon resigned the precentorship, while retaining his teaching duties, to allow himself time to work as an organist at Westminster Chapel. =Journalism= In addition to his work as a teacher and organist, Bennett conducted two choral societies in the London area. In 1865, one of the members of the choir he conducted at Blackheath recommended him to Henry Coleman, music critic of The Sunday Times, who was in need of a deputy. The position was at first unpaid, but he was soon taken on to the editorial staff of the paper, and within five years was also writing for six other publications including The Daily Telegraph and The Musical Standard. In 1870, J W Levy, proprietor of The Daily Telegraph, invited Bennett to join the staff of the paper as chief music critic. It was agreed that Bennett would not write for any rival newspapers, but he was free to contribute to strictly musical journals. He remained with the paper until 1906. In a speech at a banquet marking Bennett's retirement, the composer Sir Alexander Mackenzie said: Parry (back l.), Mackenzie (front c.) and Stanford (front r.) in 1910, with Edward German (back r.) and Dan Godfrey Bennett was inadvertently responsible for naming a long-lived movement in British music, known as the \\"English Musical Renaissance\\". In 1882, in a review of Hubert Parry's First Symphony, he wrote that the work gave \\"capital proof that English music has arrived at a renaissance period.\\"Eatock, p. 88 Bennett developed the theme in 1884, singling out for praise Frederic Cowen's Third Symphony (the Scandinavian) and operas by Arthur Goring Thomas (Esmeralda), Charles Villiers Stanford (Savonarola) and Mackenzie (Columba). This idea of an English musical renaissance was taken up with zeal by the music critic of The Times, J A Fuller Maitland. Bennett was not a member of the inner circle of the supposed renaissance; although he was a friend and collaborator of one of its leading composers, Mackenzie, he was equally a friend and collaborator of Arthur Sullivan, of whom the renaissance circle disapproved because of Sullivan's popular appeal. =Librettist and musicologist= As well as his journalistic work, Bennett was highly regarded for the analytical notes he wrote for the programmes of the Philharmonic Society and other concerts.\\"Obituary – Mr. Joseph Bennett\\", The Times, 13 June 1911, p. 13 From these, he progressed to supplying libretti for cantatas and other large-scale choral works. Among the composers with whom he collaborated on one or two works were C Lee Williams, Herbert Brewer and Frederick Bridge. With Cowen, Bennett collaborated on five large-scale works, and with Mackenzie on six, including the composer's best-known oratorio, The Rose of Sharon. Bennett's last libretto was for Sullivan's 1886 cantata The Golden Legend, based on the 1851 poem of the same name by Longfellow. Between 1877 and 1891, Bennett contributed to The Musical Times a series entitled, \\"The great composers sketched by themselves\\", dealing with the life and works of more than 30 composers. The music publisher Novello & Co reprinted five of these articles, those on Berlioz, Chopin, Rossini, Cherubini and Meyerbeer, as separate volumes. After his retirement, Bennett published a book of memoirs, Forty Years of Music. Bennett retired to Purton in Gloucestershire, not far from his birthplace. He died there at the age of 79.

During the Sino-Japanese war, many parishioners found refuge in the international settlements and so the number of faithful attending reached three thousand. During the cultural revolution, this church was confiscated and became a cultural centre. A little space was dedicated to religious ceremonies after 1984 and finally the construction of an expressway just in front of the building drove the cultural centre to move and return the building to the diocese. The building was razed to build a modern one with very colourful stained-glass windows in 1995. The church is on the third floor of the building with chapels on the second floor.

In 1723 and 1729 he obtained contracts for remitting money to the garrisons in Gibraltar and Minorca. At the 1727 general election there was a contest at Dover and he was re-elected as MP. However at the 1734 general election he was defeated in the poll. He was returned unopposed at a by-election on 18 May 1738 as MP for Morpeth which his friend Lord Morpeth had vacated on succeeding to a peerage.

He became an associate of William Pulteney, and voted with the Opposition against the Spanish convention in 1739 and for the place bill in 1740. In 1741 he was returned on the Furnese interest for New Romney, which he represented for the rest of his life. When Walpole fell in 1742, Furnese was elected a member of the secret committee and was one of Pulteney's followers who went over to the Administration and obtained offices. Furnese was appointed Secretary to the Treasury in July 1742. His appointment was referenced in many satires attacking Pulteney and he resigned from the secret committee and post in December 1742. He remained in opposition, voting against the Government in all recorded divisions and was returned again for New Romney at the 1747 and 1754 general elections.

When all the bears pick their visitor, Humphrey is stuck with Donald. At first, he makes an attempt to earn some of Donald's food by dancing but to no avail. He does earn Donald's attention when helping him set up his picnic and assorting his sandwiches for him, but goes unrewarded when it seems so. Humphrey finally helps himself to some of Donald's food, mistakenly swallowing a hot red pepper, and cools down by drinking from a nearby waterfall. Donald then leaves the park, so Humphrey follows Donald out onto the road, draws a tire mark on himself, and makes Donald believe he ran him over. Donald gives Humphrey his food, but soon realizes he has been tricked. Donald then calls for the ranger, and he and Humphrey fight with each other and drop all the food on the road, and the ranger assigns them to clean it up.

Its product portfolio includes piston compressors, screw compressors, chillers, tunnel freezers, carton and spiral freezers, valves and valve sets, driers, and exhaust ventilators. The company primarily supplies the following industrial sectors: the food and beverage industries; the petrochemical, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries; fishing ships; natural gas liquefaction; transport activities (trucks, buses, and railways); supermarkets; leisure facilities; and zoos. GEA Refrigeration Technologies is part of the GEA Group.  Founding  thumbrightChiller thumbrightPiston compressor thumbrightScrew compressor thumbrightSpiral freezer The history of GEA Refrigeration Technologies began in 1858, when Willem Grasso founded his forge Willem Grasso Stoomsmederij in 's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands. Grasso began by manufacturing steam machines and tools, followed by steam hammers and butter-making systems. His son Henri took over the flourishing business in 1894. The invention of margarine in 1896 gave the company another major push upward and made it famous for its special margarine machines. In the same year, Grasso founded a separate business unit for refrigeration technology. The Second World War severely damaged the company, which caused it to cease production of margarine machines. After the war, Grasso concentrated on refrigeration technology. Since 1991 the company is part of GEA Group. Step by step, the company acquired other companies and rounded off its portfolio of products and services. In 1993 GEA Refrigeration Technologies bought GEA Grenco, a manufacturer of refrigeration systems for the food/beverages and marine industries. One year later, GEA Refrigeration Technologies acquired the compressor specialist Kühlautomat Berlin GmbH (KAB, formerly VEB Kühlautomat Berlin). In 1995 the company was joined by the Italian compressor producer GEA Refrigeration Italy S.p.A. In 2004 GEA Refrigeration Technologies acquired Goedhart Holding BV, a Dutch maker of air coolers and refrigeration coils. In 1999 the company ILKA MAFA Kältemaschinenbau GmbH – producer of piston and screw-compressor chillers – became a member of GEA Group. In the following years, and until the restructuring of GEA Group in January 2009, the company acquired the specialist for industrial refrigeration systems, FES, Inc. (today known as GEA FES, Inc.), of the USA. It also bought Morris & Young Ltd., of London; the German valve manufacturer AWP (now GEA AWP GmbH); as well as Aerofreeze (now GEA Aerofreeze), the Canadian maker of freezer systems for the food industry. In addition, since 2009 the companies Eurotek (now Eurotek Engineering Ltd.) of Great Britain and Intec (today GEA Intec) are also part of the GEA Group. Since restructuring of GEA Group, GEA Refrigeration Technologies constitutes one of the present six Segments of the Group. In this process, Goedhart moved to the Segment GEA Heat Exchangers. In 2010 GEA Refrigeration Technologies acquired the refrigeration specialist Bock Kältemaschinen GmbH (today GEA Bock GmbH), in Frickenhausen, Germany. With this acquisition, GEA Refrigeration Technologies expanded its portfolio of piston and screw compressors in the low- and medium-performance ranges. For the expansion of the freezer portfolio GEA Refrigeration Technologies acquired the conveyor-belt specialist QPM Manufacturing, Bellevue, Washington, United States in 2011.

It is a new model that focuses on high-performance, portability and versatility. Nikon lists the estimated selling price of the Nikon 1 J1 One-Lens Kit in the United States at $649.95. Released on October 20, 2011, this kit comes with the 1 NIKKOR VR 10-30mm f/3.5-5.6 lens. This camera integrates many new technologies and is designed for ease of use, sporting only four shooting modes: Still Images, Moving Images, Motion Snapshot and Smart Photo Selector and only two buttons for Power, Shutter and Record. Nikon 1 J1 has an all-new Nikon 1 lens mount, which has made lens changes simpler and quicker. The successor is the J2.  Features  Photograph taken with Nikon 1 J1 The Nikon 1 J1 uses interchangeable lenses with Nikon 1 mount. It features a 2.7x lens focal length and 10.1 million pixels. The camera has 1080p Full HD movie capability, as well as slow motion movie that films at a speed of 400-1,200fps. While in movie mode, users can shoot photographs, as well. Videos have been tested and show to be sensitive to wind noise and will detect the sound of zoom on the lenses that allow this. While it does not produce the quality of true HD, it is still impressive. Slow-motion video has lower resolution than the HD option, and the quality is adequate for sites like YouTube. = Motion Snapshot = At the touch of the shutter, the camera takes a high-resolution still, plus a one-second movie vignette. Upon playback, this creates a motion series in slow motion, accompanied by music. This feature can be used to capture portrait, as well as landscape, photographs. This mode is really only interesting when used on the camera. Once uploaded to a computer, the video plays at normal speed and without the sound produced on the camera. The images and the video are saved as different files, but can be combined. = Auto- focus = The Nikon 1 J1 boasts very effective autofocus system with a 73-point focal plane. The autofocus extensively and thoroughly monitors the subject and tracks it to ensure the elements are sharply preserved. It automatically works to improve output in low-light situations, as well. Reviewers say that Nikon stands behind its words and users agree that the Nikon 1 J1 has incredible speed when focusing in normal light, but when light levels drop, the speed of the focus differs. While still quicker than other models, it is slower than in good light conditions. The shutter lag time is equal to that of other cameras in the class and while AF acquisition time is slower than other cameras, it is still fairly quick. = Smart Photo Selector = Upon pressing the shutter speed, the camera takes 20 shots at 30fps. From those 20, the camera then selects the best 5, and from that reduces that selection to one for a final photo recommendation. The camera selects the best pictures based on criteria such as the subject being out of frame, out of focus, blurred or having its eyes closed. This is useful in situations where the user is photographing fast actions and quick moments. = Nikon EXPEED = EXPEED 3 is Nikon's newest processing engine. = Scene Recognition Mode = This setting determines which mode the camera should capture the photograph in. It automatically will choose between portrait, landscape, close-up and night portrait depending on lighting, subject, scenery and closeness. The camera will automatically detect these settings, and choose accordingly. = Picture Control = It allows users to retouch photographs in-camera, before uploading them to a computer or printing them. Users can choose from Standard, Neutral, Vivid, Monochrome, Portrait and Landscape. = D-Lighting = Active D-Lighting optimizes images regarding balanced shadows and high-lights. While users are able to adjust exposure settings, the camera will help to correct the images or can work on its own to correct images itself. Without D-lighting, most cameras will determine lighting based on one section of the photo, which can drastically distort lighting and make the photograph appear dark and lifeless. With Active D-lighting, the Nikon 1 J1 corrects the exposure based on lighting in the entire frame and creates more lively and vivid images.  Reception  Photograph taken with Nikon 1 J1 Landscape photograph (Mount Etna, Sicily) taken with Nikon 1 J1 Honeysuckle taken with Nikon 1 J1 and 10-30mm zoom lens Since its release in October 2011, there have been many reviews of the Nikon 1 J1. PCWorld gave the camera a positive review mentioning only minor drawbacks, such as the camera not coming with a user manual and not having external flash (although cameras exported since February 2012 now come with a User Manual on both print and CD as standard). When compared to photographs from a Nikon D3, the J1 held its own, exhibiting perfect exposure and vibrant colors. They also state the flash does not live up to expected standards and users need to increase the intensity when using it from a distance. The lens also locks easily and can become a hassle when trying to smoothly take photographs, but is fine once the user gets the hang of it. Photography blog has reviewed the camera and has generally good things to say. They do note the peculiar layout of the dials and buttons on the back of the camera. They offer that the dial should have more options on it, rather than forcing the user to delve into menus to get to settings that would normally appear on the setting dial. They also point out that because the lenses for this camera do not have manual focusing rings, the manual focus that the camera does have is rudimentary at best. According to the review, it lags in wake-up time from sleep mode, picture review right after taking a picture is too long and its lack of ports make it uncompatible with other Nikon 1 accessories. TechRadar.com mentioned that the 10 megapixel camera was slightly lagging because of its boundaries on sensor resolution. Nikon believes that 12 megapixels is enough for its full-frame cameras, making the 10 megapixel appeal of this camera a slight drawback when considering the potential of this camera. Digital Camera Review says that the camera is good overall, but not a must-have for enthusiasts and Nikon fans. In the article it is stated that the J1 and V1 are not meant to replace DSLRs but are meant for users who wish to take pictures at any moment without having to resort to many lenses and a large-bodied DSLR. The review advises users to have a spare battery on hand for a full day of shooting and be wary when the battery indicator gets to a single segment. They also mention that cost and lack of viewfinder is a major drawback for this camera.

Club career Born in Orihuela, Valencian Community, Chamorro, spent the vast majority of his career in the Spanish lower leagues, starting out at Villarreal CF B then going on to represent CP Cacereño and CD Teruel. In the summer of 2011 he signed with FC Cartagena, still on loan from Villarreal CF, making his professional debut on 27 August in a 0–2 away loss against Hércules CF and scoring his first goal in Segunda División on 7 January to help defeat SD Huesca 2–0 at home, as the season ended in relegation. Chamorro subsequently returned to Segunda División B, where he appeared for Villarreal B, CD Atlético Baleares, UE Llagostera and Lleida Esportiu. He helped the second club promote to the second level for the first ever in 2014, netting 11 times playoffs included. Chamorro signed for Scottish side Hamilton Academical in July 2015, but he left after less than a month because international clearance could not be processed, joining C.D. Tondela from Portugal instead. He made his Primeira Liga debut on 27 September, coming on as an 80th-minute substitute for Dolly Menga in a 0–1 loss at C.S. Marítimo. In his last game, Chamorro featured only six minutes but was still able to contribute to a 2–2 away draw against league leaders Sporting CP, scoring the final equaliser after a counter-attack. After terminating his contract citing personal reasons, he returned to his country and signed with FC Barcelona B until 30 June 2017. Chamorro moved to Hong Kong Premier League side Hong Kong Pegasus FC in the summer of 2016. However, after appearing rarely over the course of one single season, his contract was not renewed. Chamorro continued to switch clubs and countries in the following years, representing Real Murcia, UD Logroñés (both in the Spanish third tier), Ittihad Tanger (Morocco), Doxa Drama FC (Football League (Greece)) and Mohun Bagan AC (Indian I-League).

It was published in the UK by HarperCollins on 23 June 2011. Richardson has said \\"it is not an autobiography\\" but rather it is a \\"relationship guide from the point of view of someone who hasn't been in one for eight years\\". The book began as an article in The Guardian newspaper's Weekend Supplement Valentine's Day issue, that was printed on 13 February 2010.  Synopsis  The book focuses on Richardson's various neurotic and obsessive-compulsive tendencies, and his seemingly endless pursuit of perfection. The plot details Richardson's quest to find love. After 8 years of being single and getting everything the way he likes it, all he wants now is to find \\"someone to give it all up for\\". The book follows Richardson as he carries out the day to day tasks of a comic. He drives to a comedy gig, stays at a bed & breakfast while analysing the people there, texts a girl he likes, stops at a service station on the way home, does the washing up, goes to the gym, and travels into London for a meeting about writing the book. All the while, the reader gets an insight into Richardson's unique perspective on the world, life and other people. For instance, he divides the world into two kinds of people. A person is either a 'putter', someone who puts things away and knows where their belongings are at all times, or a 'leaver', someone who constantly loses their things.

The houses were designed by Jørn Utzon for Danes who have worked for long periods abroad. History and architecture The Fredensborg Houses followed Utzon's first major housing project, the Kingo Houses in nearby Helsingør. The 63 units were based on a competition project Utzon had developed for the south of Sweden in 1953, inspired by traditional Danish farmhouses set around a central courtyard and Chinese architecture, in which the houses open out onto a central court but are protected from the surroundings by their outer wall. The development was based on Utzon's additive approach, starting modestly with one unit and proceeding from there, taking into account the lie of the land and the surroundings. Each unit was L-shaped with a living room and study in one section, and the kitchen, bedroom and bathroom in the other. Utzon described the arrangement of the houses as \\"flowers on the branch of a cherry tree, each turning towards the sun.\\"\\"Jørn Utzon, 2003 laureate, Biography\\" , PritzkerPrize.com. Retrieved 17 September 2011. Central building with restaurant, library and guest rooms As a result of the success of the Kingo Houses, Dansk Samvirke, an organization catering to the well-being of Danish citizens who have worked for long periods abroad, invited Utzon to develop a housing estate where pensioners returning to Denmark could live together and share their experiences.\\"Den danske siesta\\", Business.dk fra Berlinske, 15 October 2006. Retrieved 21 September 2011. Utzon helped to find a suitable site in Fredensborg, for which he developed plans allowing each house to have a view over a green slope. Partly inspired by housing in Beijing's Forbidden City, the complex consists of 47 courtyard homes and 30 terraced houses as well as a central building with a restaurant, meeting rooms and nine guest rooms. The homes are all located around a square in groups of three, each with an entrance from the square.\\"Utzons Fredensborghuse\\" , Danes Worldwide. Retrieved 18 September 2011. As the houses are on a slope, they all benefit from plenty of light, especially as they face either south-east or south-west. They give a general impression of openness, which is enhanced by their comparatively large courtyard gardens, even if the houses are protected from the eyes of curious outsiders. This all contributes to a feeling of security and peacefulness. The complex was completed in 1963 to wide acclaim.Kim Dirkinck-Holmfeld, Dansk Arkitektur 1960-1995, Arkitektens Forlag, Copenhagen 1995, p. 51. Subsequent influence Utzon's additive architecture approach to modern housing exerted a considerable influence on subsequent developments. In the Copenhagen area alone, his influence can be seen in Carl R. Frederiksen's Ved Stampedammen in Usserød, Bertel Udsen's Rækkehusbebyggelse in Øverød, and Henrik Iversen's Carlsmindeparken in Søllerød. More recently, Utzon's L-shape floor plan in combination with a small courtyard has been an inspiration for Bjarke Ingels Group's Mountain Dwellings in Ørestad, Copenhagen. Fredensborg Houses today As intended, the houses are occupied by Danes returning after a long career abroad, many having worked in the diplomatic corps. Although Fredensborg is just a small town, they seem to enjoy living in the area. They are able to get to Hillerød or Helsingør in less than 20 minutes and Copenhagen is only about 40 minutes away by car. They are also able to enjoy the facilities of the central building which houses a library and a restaurant which offers good meals at reasonable prices. The walls are decorated with souvenirs and artwork the pensioners have brought back from as far away as Iran, South America or Sri Lanka. The annual rental also appears low in comparison with commercial rates: some DKK 40,000 for 73 square metres or DKK 76,000 for 130 square metres.

The house was built by William Benton, a brickmaker and builder, around 1831. Benton had made a journey to Wales to collect an inheritance shortly after 1822 and there saw a house that he admired and wished to replicate on his own lands. He called the house \\"Spring Hill.\\" Description The two-story house is a Federal style structure with five bays and a center hall. Wings of three bays flank the main block. The first floor windows have been altered from six-over-six sash windows to French windows with sills close to the floor. The main entrance features double doors with sidelights and a fanlight above, which are also twentieth century alterations. The present entry replaced a small portico. The center second floor window was probably changed at this time as well, along with the dormers on the wings. The rear elevation is closer to the original. The interior is one room deep with large rooms flanking the center hall, which contains the stairs. The interior woodwork is largely original and is noteworthy. The house has several dependencies, including flanking outbuildings. The west dependency, called the \\"laundry house,\\" is a 1-1/2 story brick building with two bays, a center chimney and an end chimney. The smaller east dependency may have been a smokehouse. The property features a large by brick barn of three stories, with an attached tenant house. History Benton continued to work as a brickmaker and builder after the construction of the house, and was employed by James Madison among others. The Bentons retained the property until 1894, when it was purchased by Joshua Hatcher, who sold to Daniel Sands in 1908. Sands undertook renovations, established extensive gardens and changed the name to \\"Benton.\\" Sands bought surrounding acreage and established a prominent horse farm on the property. The house and were sold to Mr. and Mrs. James Nicklin in 1954, who sold to Mr. and Mrs. William T. Leith in 1961. Benton was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 14, 1984.

It was developed by Sander Huiberts and Richard van Tol at the Utrecht School of the Arts between 2003 and 2008, and it can be used for the analysis and synthesis (conceptual design) of sound in computer games. Description The IEZA framework uses two dimensions to describe sound in computer games. The first dimension makes a distinction between sound emanating from the fictional game world, such as the footsteps of a game character, and sound coming from outside the fictional game world, such as a musical score. Stockburger (2003) describes this distinction by using the terms diegetic and non-diegetic. The second dimension makes a distinction between sound related to the activity of the game on one hand, and sound related to the setting of the game on the other. Four domains are formed by the two dimensions: Interface, Effect, Zone and Affect. =Interface= Sound in the Interface domain expresses what is happening in the game. In many video games this is sound related to activity in the HUD, such as sounds synced to health and status bars, pop-up menus and the score display. Although sound in this domain often follows ICT interface sound design conventions (abstract iconic and non-iconic signs), there are many games that intentionally try to blur the boundaries of Interface and Effect by mimicking the diegetic concept. In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, Interface sound instances consist of the skidding, grinding and sliding sounds of skateboards. =Effect= Sound in the Effect domain expresses activity in the game world. Sound usually consists of a mix of one-shot sound events in the game world (either triggered by the player or by the game itself), such as the sound of an explosion, and continuous sound streams, such as the sound of a continuously burning fire. Sound of the Effect category often mimics the realistic behavior of sound in the real world. In many games it is the part of game audio that is dynamically processed using techniques such as real-time volume changes, panning, filtering and acoustics. =Zone= Sound in the Zone domain expresses the setting (for example the geographical, cultural and/or topological setting) of the game world. A zone can be understood as a different spatial setting that contains a finite number of visual and sound objects in the game environment (Stockburger, 2003, p. 6). It might be a whole level in a given game, or part of a set of zones constituting the level. Zone is often designed in such a way that it reflects the consequences of game play on a game's world. =Affect= Sound in the Affect domain expresses the setting (for example the emotional, social and/or cultural setting) of the game. Affect is often designed in such a way (using real time adaptation) that it reflects the emotional status of the game or that it anticipates upcoming events in the game. Applications of IEZA The IEZA framework is featured in a book chapter by Ulf Wilhelmsson and Jakob Wallén (2011). The authors combine IEZA with the model for the production of film sound by Walter Murch (1998) and the affordance theory by Gibson (1977). The framework is also used as a conceptual framework for the functioning of game audio in relation to immersion (Huiberts, 2010). Whitehead (n.d.) fuses several frameworks for game audio, amongst the IEZA framework. Conway (2010) used the framework for an analysis of digital football games. IEZA has been evaluated at the Utrecht School of the Arts Adaptive Music Systems Research Group under Jan IJzermans as a design resource in educational, academic and practical settings.

Just north of its junction with CR 10 (Bass Lake Road) and the boundary with Plymouth it becomes Northwest Boulevard and continues under that name until its junction with State Highway 55 (MN 55), intersecting with CR 47 (Pineview Lane North) and CR 9 (Rockford Road). Between MN 55 and the boundary with Minnetonka it is known as Xenium Lane, intersecting with CR 6\\\\. Between the Minnetonka boundary and CR 5 (Minnetonka Boulevard), it is known as Plymouth Road, intersecting with I-394 and Cedar Lake Road. South of Minnetonka Boulevard, it changes names again to Shady Oak Road and continues into Eden Prairie, intersecting with MN 7, MN 62 and ends at US Highway 212 (US 212), but Shady Oak Road itself continues for a short distance into the \\"Golden Triangle\\" area of Eden Prairie and ends at Valley View Road. Once US 212 was shifted onto its new freeway alignment in 2008 through Eden Prairie and Chaska, the old alignment (Flying Cloud Drive) took on the designation of CR 61 continuing to the county line with Carver County. History CR 61 was authorized and paved during the 1960s, making an alternate route for nearby I-494, intersecting with many of the same routes route I-494 did, such as I-94, MN 7, MN 55, MN 62, CR 9, CR 10, CR 5 and several others, in the western suburbs of the Twin Cities. In the 1980s, a new interchange was built at I-394, when the new freeway was being paved from Wayzata to downtown Minneapolis. In 2008, CR 61 was extended to the old alignment of U 212 (Flying Cloud Drive), to the Carver–Hennepin county line when US 212 was shifted onto the new MN 312 freeway and the 312 number, as a state highway, was retired.

Biography He graduated from the gymnasium at Elberfeld, and at 19 went to the University of Berlin to study for the Lutheran ministry. Subsequently, he spent some time at the University of Bonn in the study of natural science and theology. On the death of his father, who was a Lutheran pastor in Altena, the son was chosen in 1841 as his successor. His ministry here, while fruitful in spiritual results, excited so much opposition, and was so hampered by his ecclesiastical relations, that he resolved to emigrate to the United States. He arrived in the U.S. in 1846, and preached for some time to the Germans in Missouri. In 1847 he moved to New York City, where he edited the German tracts published by the American Tract Society. While he was residing in New York, his views on the question of baptism underwent a change, and in 1850 he entered the Baptist communion, though retaining his connection with the Tract Society until 1853. From 1853 to 1858, he served German Baptist churches in Missouri. In 1858 he was called to take charge of the German department of Rochester Theological Seminary, which place he continued to fill until 1888. He received the honorary degree of D.D. from the University of Rochester. In 1890 he returned to Germany where he devoted himself to literary work.

Before the law relating to sex offences was consolidated and revised by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007, it also prohibited various other sex offences, including sex with children under the age of consent and sex with the mentally incompetent. As the Immorality Act it was infamous for prohibiting sex between a white person and a person of another race, until that prohibition was removed by a 1985 amendment. Provisions in force ;Brothel-keeping :Section 2 makes it a crime to keep a brothel, and section 3 defines various people who are deemed to be brothel-keepers, including anyone who lives in a brothel, manages or knowingly receives money from a brothel, knowingly permits a building to be used as a brothel, is found in a brothel and refuses to disclose the name of the keeper, and the spouse of any person who keeps a brothel. Section 4 places the onus on the prosecution to prove that the owner of a building used as a brothel knew that it was a brothel, unless the rent being paid to the owner was exorbitant, or the owner was notified by a police officer or by two householders from the vicinity. The penalty for brothel- keeping was originally imprisonment for up to three years with or without a fine of up to R600; in 1988 the fine was raised to R6 000\\\\. Until the 1985 amendment, the act also prescribed a more severe penalty of up to seven years imprisonment with or without a fine of up to R1 000 if interracial sex was involved. ;Closing of brothels :Section 5 declares that any contract to let a building for use as a brothel is null and void, while section 6 voids any contract to let a building if that building subsequently becomes a brothel, but allows that an unknowing owner may still recover rent. Section 7 allows the owner of a building being used as a brothel to apply to the local magistrate for an eviction order. Section 8 allows a magistrate to issue a warrant for the search of an alleged brothel and the arrest of the alleged brothel-keeper. Such a warrant must be based on the sworn testimony of two householders in the vicinity, a police officer, or a welfare officer. ;Procuring :Section 10 forbids procuring a woman to have sex with a third party, enticing a woman to a brothel for the purpose of sex, inducing a woman to become a prostitute, and using drugs or alcohol to overpower a woman to allow a third party to have sex with her. The penalty was originally imprisonment for up to five years, or until 1985, seven years if the sex in question was interracial. In 1988 the penalty was raised to up to seven years in all cases. ;Detention :Section 12 makes it a crime to detain a woman against her will in a brothel, or for the purpose of sex. The penalty is imprisonment for up to five years. ;Assistance :Section 12A, inserted in 1967, makes it a crime to assist a person to communicate with another person for the purpose of sex for reward. The aim is to criminalise the activities of escort agencies. The penalty is imprisonment for up to five years. ;Use of premises :Section 17 makes it an offence for the owner or occupier of a house or place to knowingly allow it to be used in the commission of any other offence against the act. The penalty was originally up to six years imprisonment and a fine of up to R1 000; in 1988 the fine was increased to R12 000\\\\. ;Soliciting :Section 19 makes it a crime to entice or solicit in a public place \\"for immoral purposes\\", or to exhibit oneself in public in \\"indecent dress\\". The 2007 act amended it so that the offence can only be committed by a person over the age of 18. The penalty was originally a fine of up to R400 or imprisonment for up to two years or both; in 1988 the fine was increased to R4 000\\\\. ;Prostitution and living on the earnings of prostitution :Section 20 prohibits having sex for reward (i.e. prostitution) and living on the earnings of prostitution. The prohibition of prostitution itself was only introduced in 1988; before that time the actual act of prostitution was not a crime. The penalty was originally imprisonment for up to three years with or without a fine of up to R600; in 1988 the fine was raised to R6 000\\\\. Until the 1985 amendment, the act also prescribed a more severe penalty of up to seven years imprisonment with or without a fine of up to R1 000 if interracial sex was involved. :Section 20 also prohibits committing an \\"indecent act\\" in public, or assisting in or receiving reward for the commission of an indecent act between two people. The penalty was originally a fine of up to R400 or imprisonment for up to two years or both; in 1988 the fine was increased to R4 000\\\\. Repealed provisions ;Procuring by parent :Section 9 forbade a parent or guardian from procuring their child for sex with a third party. Originally it applied only to female children, but was extended to male children in 1988. The penalty was up to five years imprisonment, unless the child was a boy under the age of fourteen or a girl under the age of twelve, in which case the penalty could extend to life imprisonment. This section was repealed by the 2007 act, which created a broader new offence of \\"sexual exploitation of a child\\". ;Conspiracy :Section 11 made it a crime for two or more people to conspire to induce a woman to have sex by using false pretence or other fraudulent means. The penalty was imprisonment for up to five years. This section was repealed by the 2007 act, which instead includes a general conspiracy clause and the principle that fraud vitiates consent. ;Abduction :Section 13 forbade taking an unmarried person under the age of 21 out of the custody of his or her parents or guardian with the intent that he or she should have sex with either the abductor or with another person. The penalty was up to seven years imprisonment. The section was repealed by the 2007 act. ;Age of consent :In its original form, section 14 of the Sexual Offences Act made it a crime for a man to have sex with a girl or boy under the age of 16. In 1969 the age was raised to 19 for sex between two males (although such acts were also prosecutable as sodomy). In 1988 equivalent provisions were added to make it a crime for a woman to have sex with a male under 16 or a female under 19. The penalty was up to six years imprisonment and a fine of up to R1 000; in 1988 the fine was increased to R12 000\\\\. :Section 14 was repealed by the 2007 act, which fixed an equal age of consent of 16 for all sexual acts. This act was not retrospective; however, the inequality in the old act between the ages of consent for heterosexual and homosexual sex was struck down as unconstitutional in the 2008 case of Geldenhuys v National Director of Public Prosecutions. ;Mentally disabled people :In its original form, section 15 prohibited sex with a female \\"idiot or imbecile\\", meaning a person with a mental disability. In 1988 it was amended to also apply to males. The penalty was the same as that prescribed for violations of section 14 (see above). The section was repealed by the 2007 act, which created a number of new offences relating to exploitation of people with mental disabilities. ;Interracial sex :Section 16 contained the prohibition for which the name \\"Immorality Act\\" became infamous: it criminalised all extramarital sexual relations between a white person and a non-white person. (Interracial marriages were prohibited by the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act.) The penalty was imprisonment for up to seven years. The section (along with the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act) was repealed in 1985. ;Use of drugs :Section 18 made it an offence to use drugs or alcohol to overpower a woman for the purpose of having sex; the penalty was up to five years imprisonment. The section was repealed by the 2007 act, which instead provided that a person whose judgement or consciousness is adversely affected by drugs or alcohol cannot consent to sex. ;Sex toys :Section 18A, inserted in 1969, prohibited the manufacture and sale of \\"any article which is intended to be used to perform an unnatural sexual act\\", i.e. some types of sex toy. The section was repealed by the 2007 act. ;\\"Men at a party\\" :Section 20A, inserted in 1969, created the infamous \\"men at a party\\" offence. This made it a crime for any two men to commit, at \\"a party\\" an act which stimulated sexual passion or gave sexual gratification. The definition of \\"party\\" was, however, any occasion where more than two people were present. Although most sex between men was already illegal as sodomy or \\"commission of an unnatural sexual offence\\", this provision was added in response to public scandal over gay parties raided by the police in Johannesburg. The penalty was up to two years imprisonment or a fine of up to R400, or both; the fine was increased to R4 000 in 1988. :In 1998 it was invalidated (retroactively to 27 April 1994) as unconstitutionally discriminatory, in the case of National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Justice, which also struck down the offences of sodomy and commission of an unnatural sexual offence. The section was formally removed by the 2007 act. Amendments * The Immorality Amendment Act, 1967 (Act No. 68 of 1967) added section 12A (see above) aimed at prohibiting escort services and the like, and redefined all fines in terms of rands rather than South African pounds. * The Immorality Amendment Act, 1969 (Act No. 57 of 1969) introduced or expanded a number of offences (see above). It added section 18A (prohibiting sex toys) and 20A (\\"men at a party\\"). It also amended section 14 to raise the age of consent for male-male sex to 19. * The Immorality and Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Amendment Act, 1985 (Act No. 72 of 1985) repealed section 16, which prohibited interracial sex, and other provisions which penalised interracial sex more heavily. This came as part of the repeal of many petty apartheid laws under the government of P. W. Botha. * The Immorality Amendment Act, 1988 (Act No. 2 of 1988) renamed the act from \\"Immorality Act, 1957\\" to \\"Sexual Offences Act, 1957\\". It amended sections 9, 12A and 15 to be gender-neutral where they had previously referred only to females, and amended section 14 to criminalise, for the first time, a woman having sex with a person under the age of consent, for that purpose setting the age of consent at 16 for a boy and 19 for a girl. It also made it a crime to be a prostitute, where previously only certain acts related to prostitution had been illegal. * The Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1992 (Act No. 4 of 1992) made certain technical modifications to the penalty clauses. * The General Law Amendment Act, 1992 (Act No. 139 of 1992) removed a provision allowing the act to be applied in the territory of South-West Africa, as a result of that territory's independence as Namibia. * The General Law Fourth Amendment Act, 1993 (Act No. 132 of 1993) placed certain assumptions about brothel-keeping on a gender-neutral basis. * The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007 (Act No. 32 of 2007) repealed and replaced many provisions, leaving only those related to prostitution and brothel-keeping. It also amended several of the remaining sections so that people under 18 cannot be convicted of the offences they prohibit.

The present house dates from the 1790s, and was a property of the Pringle family. In 2009, the house and grounds were bequeathed to the people of Selkirkshire and the wider public. The Haining Charitable Trust is now working on developing the building as a centre for exhibitions and events, highlighting art, culture and history. The ground floor of the House has been refurbished and is now let out for various events and functions. The Old Coach House and Stable outbuildings have been refurbished and now offer six brand new artists studios. A two-bedroom holiday apartment, The Ettrick, is also now available within the grounds available for booking via Visit Scotland. The \\"Old Ginger\\" statue is located in the kennel yard. The house is protected as a category A listed building, and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens. History A motte to the north-east of the present house is the site of Selkirk Castle, first recorded in 1119. It was rebuilt by Edward I of England in 1301, during the Wars of Scottish Independence, with Sir Alexander de Balliol of Cavers in command. It was taken by the Scots the following year, but recaptured by the English before 1311. By 1334 it had been demolished. The Haining is recorded in the 15th century as a property of the Scott family. In 1625 Lawrence Scott sold it to Andrew Riddell, of Riddell, who built up the estate in the 17th century. In 1701 the estate was bought by Andrew Pringle of Clifton for his second son John Pringle, a lawyer. The \\"old\\" house may have been commissioned by John Pringle, or it may have already been in place when he arrived. The designed landscape was begun by John, and extended during the 18th and 19th centuries, with extensive tree planting carried out. In 1754 it was passed by Andrew Pringle's older son to John Pringle, merchant in Madeira, a younger brother of Andrew. It was passed in 1792 to the merchant's great nephew Mark Pringle. In 1794, Mark began construction of a new classical-style house, adjacent to the older house on the north shore of the loch. This new building has been attributed to Kelso- based architect and builder William Elliot. Mark died in 1812 and around 1820, his son John Pringle, who had inherited, remodelled the new house with an Ionic portico and loggia, to designs by architect Archibald Elliot. Further extensions were planned to replace the old house, but these were never carried out. Marble statues were installed on the garden terrace at this time, and several estate buildings including the stables were erected. Capt. John Pringle kept a menagerie on the estate, including a bear, wolf and monkey, whose cages still stand. On John's death in 1831, the estate passed to his brother Robert, also a soldier, then their sister Margaret. Her daughter Anne Pringle-Pattison left The Haining to a relative, Andrew Seth (1856–1931), a philosopher at the University of Edinburgh, who subsequently took the name Pringle-Pattison. During these years the house was leased, until 1939, when the estate was split up and sold. The house was requisitioned by the military during the Second World War, and was occupied by Free Polish soldiers, including their mascot, Wojtek the bear. The adjoining old house burnt down in 1944, and was demolished in the late 1950s. In 1959 The Haining was bought by Elina Pringle-Pattison, daughter of Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison, and her husband Francis Nimmo-Smith. Present use Andrew Nimmo-Smith, son of Eline Pringle-Pattison and Francis Nimmo-Smith, lived in the house until his death in 2009, when he left The Haining, including of grounds, \\"for the benefit of the community of Selkirkshire and the wider public.\\" Ownership of the house passed to the Haining Charitable Trust, which outlined its vision for the site in 2010. The Trust relies on volunteers for the operation and maintenance of the estate and house. The Haining overlooks the Haining Loch, around which there is a circular walk which can be enjoyed by the public. New public walking paths in the grounds were laid out in 2011. On 26 September 2012, the house featured on the BBC Two programme Antiques to the Rescue. The \\"Old Ginger” statue was unveiled on June 4 2017 in The Haining's kennel yard (the kennels utilised the cages of The Haining's original menagerie). “Old Ginger” was created by Alexander Stoddart following a fund raising initiative organised by Dandie Dinmont Terrier enthusiasts. Alexander Stoddart has been the Queen's Sculptor in Ordinary in Scotland since 2008. \\"Old Ginger\\" was born at The Haining on June 4th 1842 and today every Dandie Dinmont Terrier can trace its breeding back through its male line to \\"Old Ginger\\". \\"Old Ginger\\" was the offspring of \\"Old Pepper\\", a dog caught in a trap and rescued by a gamekeeper at nearby Bowhill House.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland- south-scotland-40157838 Dandie Dinmont Terriers are amongst the oldest and rarest of dog breeds. The breed originates from the Scottish Borders and is on the UK Kennel Club's Vulnerable Native Breeds list. The Haining Kennels are unique in being the only fully traceable founding kennels of a dog breed in the world. In February 2020 a tree fell over \\"Old Ginger\\" during Storm Dennis. The statue was undamaged, however, the tree and another in the kennel yard had to be felled. To replace them the Dandie Dinmont Terrier Club of Canada donated a Canadian Maple \\"friendship\\" tree and 3 flowering cherry trees to be planted in the kennel yard. On the first Saturday in June each year The Dandie Derby takes place. This is an informal social event for Dandie owners and on average 70 Dandies attend. The terriers race in four lanes set up in the grounds in front of The Haining. The event was featured on ITV’S Secret Life of Dogs in 2017.http://www.dandiederby.com Since 2018 the Trust has operated a wedding venue with a marquee next to the house. Concerts, exhibitions, art classes, yoga classes, charity events, celebrations, plays, funeral wakes and sundry other events are also hosted at The Haining. Extensive tree works and upgrades to footpaths around the loch and estate commenced in 2019 following a grant award of £200,000 from the Forestry Commission's 'Woodlands in and Around Towns' (WIAT) fund.https://www.bordertelegraph.com/news/17257822.200k-windfall-to-transform- haining-woodlands/ References External links *The Haining, Selkirkshire, website of the Haining Charitable Trust *The Haining, Clan Pringle Association * Category:Selkirkshire Category:Category A listed buildings in the Scottish Borders Category:Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes Category:Country houses in the Scottish Borders ","title":"The Haining"},{"id":"33162063","text":"Bunian Tu Emperor Taizong Receiving the Tibetan Envoy (also called 步辇图, Bùniǎn Tú ) is a painting on silk by Yan Liben to show the friendly encounter between the Tang dynasty and Tibet.

Known for her work detailing the female experience, she was a contemporary of Eileen Chang and is often compared to her.  Contents  * 1 Life * 2 Works * 3 References * 4 External links Life Su Qing was born in 1914 in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province. In 1933, at the age of nineteen, she was admitted to National Central University (now Nanjing University) as an English major. Due to family pressure, she quit school and married a man that her parents selected. She moved to Shanghai with her husband. In the 1940s, after an unhappy ten-year marriage, she and her husband divorced. She then started her new life as an occupational writer. Su Qing was appointed as an editor at Shaoxing Opera Group after the Anti-Japanese War. During the War of Liberation, she publicly criticized the Communist government in a series of essays and was eventually jailed for two years in 1955. Due to the bold subject matter of her work and her alleged connections to hanjian (those who were viewed as race traitors), Su Qing's career was troubled near the end of her life, and she was widely attacked and insulted by anti-hanjian groups. She died in Shanghai in 1982 after struggling with poverty and illness. Works Su Qing was once called Feng Yunzhuang (Chinese: 冯允庄) and used the pen name Feng Heyi (Chinese: 冯和仪) for her early works. She began her writing career in 1935 and started using Su Qing as her pen name in 1937. Much of her work serves on commentary on the patriarchal society she lived in and the role of women in it. Delivery (Chinese: 产女), her first work, was published in the magazine called Lun Yu. Most of her works were published in magazines including: The Wind of the Universe (Chinese: 宇宙风), Yi Jing (Chinese: 逸经), Ancient and Modern (Chinese: 古今), The Talk about the weather (Chinese: 风雨谈), and The Heaven and Earth (Chinese: 天地). Most of the essays she wrote between 1935 and 1944 were collected into one of her major works, Drifting Brocade. This work alluded to her personal life, and Su Qing said that \\"these essays are a reminiscence of my past.\\" Her representative work, Ten Years of Marriage (Chinese: 结婚十年) was published in 1943. The semi-autobiographical novel describes her experiences about her married life. It contains her initial feelings on marriage, the bitterness and happiness of delivery, the extramarital love and the associations with different kinds of men. Owing to the authentic descriptions of sexual psychology, she was described as a bold female writer and received both praise and blame. The fiction had its separate edition the following year. Ten Years of Marriage had 18 editions at the end of 1948, which surpassed Eileen Chang’s fiction. In 1947, she created the continuation of Ten Years of Marriage. She also wrote a novel called The Beauty on the Wrong Road (Chinese: 歧路佳人), which caused a shortage of printing paper. During the years at Shaoxing Opera Group, she compiled these plays: Hate Remains in the Land, Qu Yuan, Baoyu and Daiyu and The Biography of Li Wa. Baoyu and Daiyu has been performed more than 300 times since 1954 and created the highest records of the Opera group.

He later served in the United States Marine Corps during the Korean War. In the 1960s he opposed desegregation busing in the United States.  1967 Newark riots  During the 1967 Newark riots, Imperiale advocated armed white self-defense and formed the volunteer North Ward First Aid Squad ostensibly to escort North Ward residents, most of whom were Italian-American, through racially troubled neighborhoods. The group was accused of vigilantism, and Governor Richard J. Hughes called Imperiale's followers \\"Brownshirts\\". At one point during the riots, Imperiale warned that \\"when the Black Panther comes, the white hunter will be waiting.\\" In 1969, the group disbanded.  Political career  = Newark City Council = Imperiale was elected to the Newark City Council in 1968 and re-elected in 1970. In 1970, he ran for mayor, but finished third in a six-man field.

Running as an independent on a \\"For the People\\" ticket, he received the most votes in a field of 7 candidates. On his arrival in the Assembly in 1972, Imperiale declined to join either major party. He went so far as to plant his seat in the aisle separating the two parties and refused to move out of the way. At the time, Democrats had a slim 40-39 advantage in the chamber. = State Senate = In 1973, Imperiale ran as an independent for the New Jersey State Senate, seeking an open seat in the newly created 30th district, which comprised Newark's East Ward, and the towns of Harrison and Kearny.

He defeated three-term Democratic Assemblyman John F. Cali. = 1981 gubernatorial campaign = He gave up his Assembly seat in 1981 to seek the Republican nomination for Governor of New Jersey, finishing 6th in a field of 8 candidates with 5% of the vote. Later, Imperiale made unsuccessful bids for Essex County Freeholder, Essex County Sheriff, and U.S. Representative.  Personal life  After leaving office, Imperiale founded a volunteer ambulance company in Newark. As a volunteer paramedic, he was praised by his former political rivals and for his generosity, sense of humor, and commitment to equal treatment. In 1984, Imperiale's son Anthony Jr. was sentenced to nine years in prison for shooting and wounding a minor who was making noise outside his bedroom window.

The caterpillars of this species are known to create nests by tying the leaves of their host plant together. Within the nests, they live and feed off the leaves that have been tied together. The larvae are brownish or greenish yellow with a shiny dark brown head. Larvae can be found from May to July. The species overwinters as an egg, and pupation takes place within the nest. Caterpillars are seen follow one another in trails, a behavior prompted by the release of signaling pheromones from their spinnerets. A. cerasivorana is found throughout North America, as far north as Alaska and as far south as North Carolina. The wingspan is 20–25 mm. The forewings are dull orange marked with irregular dark brownish spots. The hindwings are yellow with orange shading. Adults can be found from July to September in one generation per year.  Taxonomy  A. cerasivorana is commonly referred to as the ugly-nest caterpillar moth. It is a species of moth in the family Tortricidae. Related species include Archips fervidana. Archips rileyana is very similar to A. cerasivorana, both in appearance and larval habits. At first, A. rileyana was considered a subspecies of A. cerasivorana, but Obraztsov (1959) demonstrated that both adults and larvae of the two species can be separated. A. cerasivorana is characterized by an uncus with parallel sides in the male, a large blunt signum in the female, and smaller, sometimes body-colored pinacula on the larval abdomen. In contrast, A. rileyana is characterized by a spatulate uncus in the male, a moderate pointed signum in the female, and very large, conspicuous, black pinacula on the larval abdomen.  Diet  The larvae feed on the leaves of Prunus virginiana, Prunus serotina, Crataegus, Rosa, Malus, Cotoneaster, Betula and Populus species.  Distribution  It is found in various parts of North America, from Alaska to Canada and United States. Within the United States, it can be found towards the east in New England, the south in North Carolina, and the west in California, Utah, and Colorado.  Morphology  = Larval morphology = Larva The larvae are distinct by their coloration. Early instars are yellowish-green with black legs, head, prothoracic shield, and anal shield. The later instars are bright orange with the same contrasting dark sclerotization and with sparse moderately long pale setae. Last instar larvae are 19–26 mm in length with a yellow to dark yellowish-green abdomen. The head, prothoracic shield, thoracic legs, and anal shield are dark brown to black. An anal comb is absent. Larvae of Archips rileyana are very similar to those of A. cerasivorana. = Adult morphology = In adult males, the forewing length ranges from 7.5-9.5 mm; and 9.0-12.0 mm in females. The adults are easily recognized by the orange forewing with many silvery bars. Forewing color varies from bright orange to yellow, often with faint purplish markings. Males have a forewing costal fold. There are distinct brown squared blotches along the costa in the postmedian and median area, along with variable smaller brown markings through the middle of the wing in the antemedian and median areas. The hindwings and most of the body is also orange. The wingspan is 20–25 mm. The hindwings are yellow with orange shading.  Life cycle and behavior  Eggs There is one generation every year. Females lay masses of 25-200 eggs at the base of shoots, often near the ground. Females mainly prefer chokecherry. Eggs overwinter and first instar larvae hatch in May. Adults can be found from early July to mid-September. Unlike many tortricids, the larvae are social, and feeding occurs in silken nests on terminals of the host plants. The webs are made around the terminal shoots of the host, sometimes enveloping entire plants. Pupation occurs inside individual cells inside the shelter. Adults are not very active during the day and can be found resting on foliage. At night, the adults are known to be attracted to lights. A typical nest may contain 30-200 larvae and reach up to 30 inches in diameter. The nest is expanded when the colony needs additional food and feeding always occurs under the protection of the nest. Early stages skeletonize leaves while later stages consume entire leaves. Pupation occurs in chambers constructed in the nest from frass and silk. Before emerging, the pupae will force their way to the outer surface of the silk nest where the adult moth ecloses. = Building of tents = thumb From the first instar, the caterpillars will aggregate and build large tent structures. These caterpillars are one of the few in the family Tortricidae that exhibit social behavior. They make these tents by spinning silk threads between leaves and branches, which draws them into a compact nest. Each strand of silk is stretched slightly before it is attached to a leaf so that a tiny force (from axial retraction) will pull the leaf slightly towards the nest. When many strands of silk are spun to the surrounding leaves, the net forces will eventually drive all the leaves into the characteristic tent shape. The caterpillars usually stay within boundaries defined by the silk that envelops their shelter. They occasionally venture out of the nest, traveling only short distances to draw in new leaves. In most cases, the colony finds a sufficient number of leaves in its contiguous patch to complete larval development. If all of the leaves within a tent are consumed before the caterpillars are ready to pupate, the caterpillars will be forced to leave their nest and find a new nesting location. During these migrations, the caterpillars will depart individually or in small groups, leaving small silken trails laced with pheromones to guide the next caterpillar. = Trail-marking and following = Trail-following has been hypothesized as a product of both chemical and physical input. Research has shown that trail-following behavior in a caterpillar originates, in part, from the following of pheromones left by other caterpillars. Each caterpillar secrets marker pheromones secreted from glands by the spinnerets, no other regions of the body have been shown to secrete pheromones. Experiments have shown that caterpillars are capable of following trails prepared with gland extracts, but such trails were markedly less effective than originally-intact control trails. Also, caterpillars display a preference for silk-like trails. When presented with a variety of pheromone-trail mediums, from nonporous steel, to cotton, to the original trail, experimental caterpillars preferred the original silk trail.  Interactions with humans  thumb Ugly-nest caterpillars cause little permanent damage to plants besides branch deformity. They have little to no economic impact. The largest problem they pose is cosmetic. The caterpillars will sometimes build their unsightly nests in orchards and gardens. The caterpillars will web together foliage which they then feed, defecate, and pupate in. The nests can be easily located by visual inspection; they are found primarily on chokecherry, but can also be found on other hardwoods and shrubs. To monitor an orchard for presence of caterpillars, one should look for the development of untidy nests of webbing, twigs, and leaves. = Removal of caterpillars = The best means for removal is to prune and destroy webbed nests. The caterpillars can also be chemically removed through use of pesticides. Pesticides like the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis can be sprayed to control young larvae. Larger populations of older larvae can be controlled with a residual insecticide, but damage is rarely sufficient to warrant treatment that may endanger the rest of the local environment. Biorational pesticides like insecticidal soap, pyrethins, spinosad, and tenbufenozide can also be used.

He was co-founder of Sirocco Recording Studio in Kilmarnock which ran from 1978-1989. Music recordings During a career spanning five decades Sorley has made upwards of 10,000 music recordings, the majority of these being for commercial release or broadcast. The remainder is unreleased material numbering around 1,300 works most of which Sorley either composed, arranged, produced or performed. The unreleased archive has been recently curated and remastered for online streaming. Sirocco After playing in pub-rock bands in the first half of the 1970s Sorley started Sirocco Studio with a bunch of musician friends. Over the next eleven years it became one of the most widely used facilities in Scotland,Walker, Bill (1985). “Studiofile” Studio SoundRussell, Ian (1984) \\"Sirocco Studio has the sound of success\\" Kilmarnock Standard initially favoured by post-punk bands like The Laughing Apple and Positive Noise for its lo-fi credentials. Although in later years it came to be owned and managed by Sorley it began in a collective spirit with an emphasis on nurturing emergent talent. Thousands of musicians cut their studio teeth at Sirocco. Many went on to have careers in the business such as the studio’s engineer, Frank Reader, whose band Trashcan Sinatras bought Sorley out following their signing to Go! Discs in 1989. The studio name was then changed to Shabby Road. Among artists of note known to have worked at Sirooco in the 1980s were Del Amitri, The Bluebells, Aztec Camera, Kissing the Pink, Alan McGee, Andrew Innes, Martin Taylor, Alexander Stoddart, Hamish Imlach, Eddi Reader, Elaine C Smith, Mike Ogletree, Terry Neason, Tiger Tim Stevens, Mr. Superbad, Mary Kiani, Big George and the Business and Jimmy Dewar. In 1985 James Kelman edited his ‘’Writers For Miners’’ projectWriters For Miners The Glasgow Herald in Sirocco. It was a live recording made by Sorley in The Third Eye Centre in Glasgow of Scotland’s prominent poets and novelists at the time. The same year Dick Gaughan, also in support of the miners, made the ‘’True & Bold’’ album at the studio for the S.T.U.C. which Sorley co-produced. Around the same time Tracey Ullman and Robbie Coltrane came to the studio to perform on the music tracks for BBC Scotland’s A Kick Up the Eighties. Also for the BBC, saxophonist Tommy Smith filmed part of a documentary about his career there as did cult Glasgow band Scheme for Channel 4. Scheme had previously recorded their first album funded by Glasgow City Council at Sirocco. Channel 4 Glasgow based record labels Klub, Lismor and Corban recorded over 100 albums in Sirocco with mainly traditional Scottish music artists including The Alexander Brothers, Andy Stewart, Kenneth McKellar, Peter Morrison, Robert Urquhart and Bill McCue. For Lismor the studio made location recordings of the Royal Highland Fusiliers, the 78th Fraser Highlanders and Shotts and Dykehead Pipe Band. Folk singer Alastair McDonald, owner of Corban, was a regular client who Sorley continues to work with today.The Scots Magazine Reviews Radio Clyde Sorley joined the music production department at Radio Clyde in 1979 working with Andy Park and Bob McDowall. He recorded for Clyde’s jazz oriented library label which produced records with Carol Kidd, Bobby Wishart, Danny Street, Bobby Wellins and Peggy O'Keefe. Over an eighteen-month period at Radio Clyde, Sorley made broadcast recordings of: Rose Royce, Lulu, Gordon Giltrap, Durutti Column, The Fall, Bad Manners, Pete Shelley, Orange Juice, Spandau Ballet, The Stiff Tour, Climax Chicago Blues Band, Alice Cooper, The Pretenders, Simple Minds, Depeche Mode, 10cc, Funkapolitan, Wang Chung, Morrissey–Mullen, Mike Westbrook, Stan Tracey, Don Weller, Jimmy Deuchar, Al Cohn, Benjamin Luxon, Peter Pears, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. Sorley left the Clyde staff in 1981 and as a free-lance produced programmes for the station with live music content, recording many headline artists including Ben E. King, The Drifters, The Waitresses, The Average White Band, Mari Wilson, Big Audio Dynamite, Slade, Runrig and Shakatak. He also covered the Pope's visit to Glasgow in 1982. All these live recordings were done using Mobile Two, a 24-track unit custom-built to a high spec by the Clyde engineers under John Lumsden. They were remixed in the station's multi-track studio and produced to record master quality. They are part of a larger body of live recordings done by Radio Clyde referred to in The Guardian in 2003 as \\"a musical treasure trove\\" when discovered years later.a musical treasure trove The Guardian Independent Away from Sirocco and Clyde, Sorley worked independently in a variety of music related roles. He was musical director on Scottish Television’s Terry Neason Show in 1987. He also appeared live with Terry at The Donmar Warehouse and on Radio 2. His work with singer-songwriter James Oliver resulted in two of their collaborations rising to the finals of BBC’s A Song For Europe in 1988 and 1989. Sorley performed live on the show and on Wogan. Wogan He spent a few weeks in 1983 playing bass with Liverpool band The Lotus Eaters prior to the release of their first hit single on Arista. The same year he worked with Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark at David Balfe’s studio in the Scottish Highlands. For 15 years from 1986 Sorley produced a broadcast of West Sound Radio’s annual Burns Supper. The biggest such event in the world,Largest Burns Supper marks 10th birthday The Herald it was represented by a star cast, from ex prime ministers to leading clergy and celebrities. Other notable artists recorded during his time as an independent were Les Dennis, Daniel O’Donnell and Isobel Buchanan. Sorley became involved in consultancy work for the Scottish Development Agency in the late 80s. After extensive research in the UK and US working with Simon Frith, Alex Neil and John Swinney, he drew up a set of proposals with comprehensive ideas and business plans for furthering the music industry in Scotland. In the absence of suitable funding partners the project never progressed beyond being a research initiative.Williamson, John (1989) \\"Sonic Boom\\" The List MagazineSillitoe, Sue (1988) \\"Scots seek sponsors for capital complex\\" Pro Sound NewsSorley, Jackie (1988) \\"A Scottish music industry?\\" M8 Magazine Recording artist The folk-rock band Dalriada was created by Sorley in 1991 with studio colleagues Colin Kennedy and Robbie Dale.

Sorley worked with film-maker Ian Roy on the Rainmaker project in 1999. It merged films of Scottish landscapes by Roy to Sorley’s music tracks. The music was subsequently used by photographer Alan Wright of Lyrical Scotland for his series of travel DVDs. Production company With ex-Sirocco mate George Cowan and backers Douglas Cardow and Iain Robertson, the production company Rainmaker-Sonic was set up in 2000. The venture didn’t fulfill its aims but during its run Sorley established a relationship with Scott Gibson, then manager of R&B; singer Rosie Gaines. Sorley and Gibson collaborated on a number of projects over the next few years including work for Gaines as well as having the dance track \\"Back & Forth\\" signed to Warners. It was sung by Alice Campbell with production and additional writing by Sorley. The track was not released due to sample clearance issues. Record label In April 2010 Legacy Scotland was launched as Sorley’s online music label. Consistent with changes in the way recorded music is distributed and marketed, an experimental release schedule was implemented by putting out one four-track EP every month, a track each week. The label’s design concept is a deliberate “library” style, i.e. each release uses generic artwork with no photographs thus reflecting the fact that the recordings are the producer’s work in which the performers have collaborated. Most of the label’s performers are from the community of musicians around Sorley’s current studio in Kilmarnock. Personal life Sorley remains unmarried and has spent the greater part of his private life pursuing intellectual interests. He was three years at Edinburgh University in the 1990s doing recreational study, centrally philosophy, and following a further period of reading started writing a series of short essays in 2002. They have since become the weblog ‘’What I Think’’ currently numbering around 500 items with discussion on philosophy, music, relationships and personal issues. There is also some broader commentary including critiques on current affairs.

Hülser, Die Fragmente zur Dialektik der Stoiker, vol. 3. p. VI. It presents a detailed picture of the Stoic theory of modality.S. Knuuttila, Modalities in Medieval Philosophy, p.16. In her paper \\"Stoic Syllogistic\\" Bobzien sets out the evidence for Stoic syllogistic. She argues that Stoic syllogistic should not be assimilated to standard propositional calculus, but rather treated as a distinct system which bears important similarities to relevance logic.Review of Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy XIV, 1996.

While in the Ottoman Army Abdulmajid had been in charge of a regiment and was therefore names, Haytabashi, later transliterated by Russians to Qaytabashi and assigned to him as his title. Abdulhamid's father, Lieutenant colonel Sharif Bey Gaytabashi served as a translator in the Documentation Department of the Russian Army in Caucasus and in the Caucasian Cavalry. Abdulhamid was his seventh child born during Sharif Bey's second marriage. Abdulhamid graduated from Pavlovsk Military College in 1908. As second lieutenant, he was assigned to the 261st Shemakha reserve infantry unit deployed in Elisabethpol. When World War I started, Gaytabashi served in the 205th infantry regiment of the 52nd infantry division of the 3rd Caucasus Corps. For his excellence on the battlefield, Stabskapitän Gaytabashi was conferred with the Order of St. Vladimir of 4th degree. Service in Azerbaijani Army Gaytabashi started his service in the Azerbaijani Armed Forces as an on-duty field-officer in the army corps. In January 1919, he was a member of Commission for Development of Army Units and Management of Military Office of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. On June 25, 1919 Gaytabashi was promoted to Major General and was subsequently appointed Chief of General Staff of Azerbaijani Armed Forces in December 1919. He was considered one of the most experienced military experts of the armed forces. After occupation of Azerbaijan by Bolsheviks, he was appointed Chief of General Staff of the Red Army Corps in Azerbaijan. However, in June, 1920 he was executed by firing squad for his alleged role in Ganja revolt.

It is named after the German mathematician and mathematical physicist Hermann Weyl. Equation The general equation can be written: Quantum Mechanics, E.

A dual form of the equation is usually written as: : \\\\bar{\\\\sigma}^\\\\mu\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\psi=0 where \\\\bar{\\\\sigma}^\\\\mu = (I_2,-\\\\sigma_x,-\\\\sigma_y,-\\\\sigma_z). =Weyl spinors= The term \\"Weyl spinor\\" can refer to either one of two distinct but related objects. One refers to the plane-wave solutions of the Weyl equation, given here. The other refers to the abstract algebra of spinors, as geometric objects, at a single point in space-time (that is, abstract spinors in zero- dimensional space-time). These abstract spinors are defined and discussed in greater detail in the articles on the spin group and the Weyl–Brauer matrices. The algebra of zero-dimensional geometric spinors can be extended to four- dimensional spacetime (or to manifolds of other dimensions) by means of a spin structure. Very briefly, spin structures can be taken as fiber bundles, where the fiber is the geometric spinor, transforming under the action of the spin group. Solutions to the Weyl equation are then specific sections through the bundle. These more formal considerations do not need to be understood to give the basic plane-wave solutions to the Weyl equation. These solutions are the left and right handed Weyl spinors, each with two components. Both have the form : \\\\psi (\\\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\psi_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\chi e^{-i(\\\\mathbf{k}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\omega t)}= \\\\chi e^{-i(\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{r}-Et)/\\\\hbar}, where : \\\\chi = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\chi_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\chi_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} is a momentum-dependent two-component spinor which satisfies : \\\\sigma^\\\\mu p_\\\\mu \\\\chi = ( I_2 E - \\\\vec{\\\\sigma} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{p} ) \\\\chi = 0 or : \\\\bar{\\\\sigma}^\\\\mu p_\\\\mu \\\\chi = ( I_2 E + \\\\vec{\\\\sigma} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{p} ) \\\\chi = 0 . By direct manipulation, one obtains that :(\\\\bar{\\\\sigma}^ u p_ u) (\\\\sigma^\\\\mu p_\\\\mu) \\\\chi = (\\\\sigma^ u p_ u) (\\\\bar{\\\\sigma}^\\\\mu p_\\\\mu) \\\\chi = p_\\\\mu p^\\\\mu \\\\chi = (E^2 -\\\\vec{p}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{p}) \\\\chi = 0, and concludes that the equations correspond to a particle that is massless. As a result, the magnitude of momentum p relates directly to the wave-vector k by the De Broglie relations as: : \\\\mathbf{p} = \\\\hbar \\\\mathbf{k} = \\\\hbar \\\\omega /c \\\\, \\\\rightarrow \\\\, \\\\mathbf{k} = \\\\omega /c The equation can be written in terms of left and right handed spinors as: :\\\\begin{align} & \\\\sigma^\\\\mu \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\psi_R = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\bar{\\\\sigma}^\\\\mu \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\psi_L = 0 \\\\end{align} =Helicity= The left and right components correspond to the helicity λ of the particles, the projection of angular momentum operator J onto the linear momentum p: :\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{J}\\\\left\\\\mathbf{p},\\\\lambda\\\\right\\\\rangle=\\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{p}\\\\left\\\\mathbf{p},\\\\lambda\\\\right\\\\rangle Here \\\\lambda=\\\\pm 1/2.

The Latin and Greek name is '. According to popular legend, however, the name Denmark, refers to the mythological King Dan. There are also a number of references to various Dani people in Scandinavia or other places in Europe in Ancient Greece and Roman accounts (like Ptolemy, Jordanes, and Gregory of Tours), as well as some medieval literature (like Adam of Bremen, Beowulf, Widsith and Poetic Edda). Most handbooks deriveJ. de Vries, Altnordisches etymologisches Wörterbuch, 1962, 73; N. Å. Nielsen, Dansk etymologisk ordbog, 1989, 85–96. the first part of the word, and the name of the people, from a word meaning \\"flat land\\", related to German Tenne \\"threshing floor\\", English den \\"low ground\\", Sanskrit dhánus- (धनुस् \\"desert\\"). The -mark is believed to mean woodland or borderland (see marches), with probable references to the border forests in south Schleswig,Navneforskning, Københavns Universitet Udvalgte stednavnes betydning . maybe similar to Finnmark, Telemark, or Dithmarschen.Asernes æt Daner, Danir, Vandfolket Mythological explanations Some of the earliest descriptions of the origin of the word 'Denmark', describing a territory, are found in the Chronicon Lethrense (12th century), Svend Aagesen (late 12th century), Saxo Grammaticus (early 13th century) and the Ballad of Eric (mid 15th century). There are, however, many more Danish annuals and yearbooks containing various other details, similar tales in other variations, other names or spelling variations. The Chronicon Lethrense explains how the Roman Emperor Augustus battled Denmark in the time of David,The 'David' referred to here appears to be David, the ancient king of the Israelites: of course this is wildly anachronistic, but it is fairly typical of such sources, which commonly sought to push national or dynastic origins as far back as possible. Denmark consisted of seven territories Jutland, Funen, Zealand, Møn, Falster, Lolland and Skåne which were governed by King Ypper of Uppsala. He had three sons, Nori, Østen and Dan. Dan was sent to govern Zealand, Møn, Falster, and Lolland, which became known jointly as Videslev. When the Jutes were fighting Emperor Augustus they called upon Dan to help them. Upon victory, they made him king of Jutland, Funen, Videslev and Skåne. A council decided to call this new united land Danmark (Dania) after their new king, Dan. Saxo relates that it is the legendary Danish King Dan, son of Humbli, who gave the name to the Danish people, though he does not expressly state that he is also the origin of the word \\"Denmark\\". Rather he tells that England ultimately derives its name from Dan’s brother Angel. Earliest occurrences Jelling Stones, commonly referred to as Denmark's \\"baptismal record\\", seen from the north with \\"Gorm's Mound\\" in the background The earliest mention of a territory called \\"Denmark\\" is found in King Alfred the Great's modified translation into Old English of Paulus Orosius' Seven Books of History Against The Pagans (\\"Historiarum adversum Paganos Libri Septem\\"), written by Alfred when king of Wessex in the years 871–899. In a passage introduced to the text by Alfred, we read about Ohthere of Hålogaland’s travels in the Nordic region, during which 'Denmark [Denamearc] was on his port side... And then for two days he had on his (port side) the islands which belong to Denmark'.Thorpe, B., The Life of Alfred The Great Translated From The German of Dr. R. Pauli To Which Is Appended Alfred's Anglo-Saxon Version of Orosius, Bell, 1900, p. 253. In the Treaty of Heiligen, which was signed at Heiligen in 811 between Denmark and the Frankish empire, it mentions King Hemming and Charlemagne. Based on the terms of the accord, the southern boundary of Denmark was established at the Eider River. Moreover, the treaty confirmed the peace established by both signatories in 810.Thursten, p. 67. The first recorded use of the word \\"Denmark\\" within Denmark itself is found on the two Jelling stones, which are rune stones believed to have been erected by Gorm the Old (c. 955) and Harald Bluetooth (c. 965). The larger stone of the two is popularly cited as Denmark's baptismal certificate (dåbsattest), though both use the word \\"Denmark\\", in the form of accusative \\"tanmaurk\\" () on the large stone, and genitive \\"tanmarkaR\\" (pronounced ) on the small stone.The dative form tąnmarku (pronounced ) is found on the contemporaneous Skivum stone. The inhabitants of Denmark are there called \\"tani\\" (), or \\"Danes\\", in the accusative. In the Song of Roland, estimated to have been written between 1040 and 1115, the first mention of the legendary Danish hero Holger Danske appears; he is mentioned several times as \\"Holger of Denmark\\" (Ogier de Denemarche).

Communication is successful only when both the sender and the receiver understand the same information.Nowadays business world, effective communication skills are necessary due to the highly informational and technological era,Which has made it easier for exchanging of information between the parties. Despite of the context, communication is all about choice, reflects values, and has consequences. For better communication, understanding the obvious and the subtle issues relating to communication is necessary. Any company that aims to be socially and ethically responsible must make a priority of ethical communication both inside the company and in its interactions with the public. In theory, many consumers prefer to do business with companies they believe are ethical which gives those ethical businesses an advantage in the market.  Overview  Some of the vital characteristics of ethical communication are discussed below. *Conveying the point without offending the audience: While communicating with the audience, expressing the desired message to them in a significant manner is of primary importance.Strong conversation skills can make a big difference in the workplace. Knowing how to share an attentive, friendly discussion will give you more confidence and help you build better relationships. As you improve your skills, you’ll become a more thoughtful listener, give sharper responses, and learn how to handle common mistakes. For instance, the employees in a company can be asked to increase their efficiency in a demanding manner whereas managers and executives will feel offended if the same tone is used on them. There are different ways to explain the exact things to them in a much smoother manner. *Maintain a relationship with the audience: Maintaining the same wavelength with the audience is very important for a communicator to ensure the audiences feel at home. Experienced communicators immediately build a relationship based on trust with the audience as soon as they start speaking.As the audience shares, ask relevant questions to give them further chances to express themselves. Be curious about the audience! For instance, if they’re talking about a tough presentation they just gave, ask how they felt when they finished. *Avoid withholding crucial information: In the modern era, information is vital for all decision. Hence, it is essential for any organization to be cautious when communicating with titanic. The related information should be absolute, and all crucial information must be passed on appropriately. Purposely withholding crucial information might result in the public conceiving a bad image. *Well organized value system: In order to ensure that this concept is successfully practiced and understood in an organization, a well-organized value system must be established throughout the organization by the top management.If an organization functions on the base of value systems common to both the top management and the employees, mutual respect between them will be present. A sound and healthy value system can make way for ethical communication. *Accuracy of information is necessary: Any information that is to be passed on must be true and accurate. Communicating without checking the truth of the information can be highly dangerous for the organization. Identification of the source and testing the information is necessary before communicating it.  Summary  The work of an organizational communication professional consists in developing communication plans that seek to restore trust, not only in the organization but the leaders and in all the people who work for it, in verbally promoting ethical behaviors and generating spaces of communication that help support institutional values. In this way, both managers and employees will be \\"on the same page,\\" employees will feel heard and respected and will treat customers in the same way. Also, this will generate more loyalty on the part of the client and, therefore, more business. In addition, a business that communicates internally with ethics will most likely project that image in the business community, will seek to maintain good relations with the government and its most successful businesses. Without the distractions and negative effects that can have the legal implications of running a business \\" ethically debatable,\\" the organization will be able to concentrate its efforts on its employees, its products, and its clients.

The street is the northern and eastern boundary of De Wallen red-light district and runs between Prins Hendrikkade and Nieuwmarkt. Historically an area riddled with crime and drug addicts, the area went through a revitalization and is now the main street of Amsterdam's Chinatown, where locals come to eat at Vietnamese, Thai and Chinese restaurants. The Zeedijk neighbourhood is also known as the Nautical Quarter (Dutch: Nautisch Kwartier) because of its past as a sailors' neighbourhood. The zeedijk was constructed as seawall or dike to protect Amsterdam from the water of the IJ, which was in open connection with the Zuiderzee until 1872. The street's curvature is a noticeable remnant of its adherence to the contours of the old dike. Halfway along the dike is the former Sint Anthoniespoort, the old city gate now called the Waag. Beyond the gate running south-east, the dike continued as Sint Antoniesdijk (now Sint Antoniesbreestraat). The neighbourhood is one of the oldest parts of Amsterdam. In 1544, Zeedijk was the first street to have permanent street lights installed. Until the 17th century, the curve of the promenade was one of the most respectable places where one could live. After the construction of the luxurious Herengracht, the wealthy merchants moved out of the area and it became a centre of nightlife for passing sailors. The old bars and the shops for ship supplies are still a reminder of this. bilingual street signs Zeedijk is the heart of Chinatown, the Chinese neighbourhood of Amsterdam. There are many tokos and restaurants there, such as Nam Kee, described in the novel De Oesters van Nam Kee by Kees van Beijnum and the movie based on the book. The text on the street signs in the Zeedijk area and Nieuwmarkt are both in Dutch as well as in Chinese. The neighborhood is the location of the Guang Shan He Hua Temple, a Buddhist temple which is open to the public. It was at the Zeedijk where jazz musician Chet Baker died in 1988. He fell or threw himself out the window of the Prins Hendrik Hotel. A plaque was put up at the site in his memory. Café 't Mandje on Zeedijk 63 was an early example of a bar where, aside from prostitutes, pimps and sailors, gays and lesbians were also welcome. Opened in 1927, owner Bet van Beeren soon became an icon within Amsterdam's LGBT community. After her death in 1967, her sister Greet continued the café until 1983. It was reopened in 2008 by relatives. Besides Café 't Mandje, there were other gay bars in Zeedijk as well. Around 1998, four gay bars had opened in close proximity to each other along the bend at the north-east end of Zeedijk, making this area one of Amsterdam's hotspots of gay nightlife. Once a year, in August, the \\"Hartjesdagen\\" take place on the Zeedijk, a festival featuring a parade of costumed participants.

Murray Judicial Complex in Washington Square Washington Square is the geographical and historical heart of Newport Rhode Island. More trapezoid than square, it exists at the intersection of several major streets and what was the colonial long wharf, projecting into the harbor off Aquidneck Island and into Narragansett Bay. Although as a civic space it is colonial in origin, dating back to the first settlement of 1639, much of its present shape, form and name dates from the 19th century while a number of its most prominent buildings are of early 20th century design. Like most great civic spaces, it developed over time rather than being imposed by design. The first group of Anglo settlers – among them William Coddington, John Clarke, Henry Bull, and the Easton family each clustered their house lots of about ten acres close to a fresh water spring and a short distance uphill from the shoreline. The spring still flows (although its course is now subterranean) but all the original houses are gone, the last, Henry Bull's, being destroyed by fire in 1912. Cannon of brig Tartar, commander Captain Daniel Fones, Washington Square (c.1922); removed to the Newport Historical Society What remains from the areas 17th-century origins are adjacent street names (Coddington, Bull, Clarke, Dyer) and the street layout itself. Vectors lead along the residential hill and harbor (Thames Street, Spring Street), up island (Broadway) and northwest, out of town, toward the Common Burying Ground established by the 1660s (the aptly named cortege route of Farewell Street). These don't quite converge at the square but instead enter at various points onto an open space flanked by both residential and institutional buildings. By the nineteenth century, this spot came to be known as \\"The Parade\\" and became a more defined, park-like area with boundary fencing, trees, fountain and a bronze sculpture of one of Newport's military heroes, Oliver Hazard Perry. Two of colonial America's most significant buildings are at either end of the square, Newport's Colony House, built by Richard Munday (1739) and the Brick Market designed by Peter Harrison (1772); as a public space, this \\"square\\" contained two important civic symbols: the impressively ornate seat of the colonial government and a fashionable Georgian symbol of Newport's economic success. From 1995 to the present, Washington Square has been revitalized by The Washington Square Advisory Commission. Building on an original design by artist, inventor and restorer Howard Newman, the commission completely rebuilt the Square to more closely serve its original function as a gathering place for Newport’s citizenry, and dedicating itself to the square’s continued historic, architectural, cultural, and commercial significance. To accomplish the goals, the traffic pattern was re-designed, and a 19th century horse trough fountain was commissioned, recreated and installed as its focal point by Newmans Ltd., which recreated the trough in bronze, based on archival photographs from the library of the Newport Historical Society. Horse Trough Fountain at Washington Square There are plans and proposals to continue to renovate and reinvigorate the square today but while other areas of Newport have become better known because of tourist marketing, Washington Square has long been the hometown \\"hearth\\" of the city. One testament to that status were the old Homecoming events, welcoming all native near and far back to Newport during which a triumphal arch was set up in the square and scores of former residents gathered to celebrate their hometown in that time honored place.

They were an affiliate to the San Jose Sharks of the National Hockey League and the Worcester Sharks of the American Hockey League. History Goaltender Thomas Heemskerk on November 10, 2012, at the Cow Palace Beginning with the 2012–13 season, the Bulls played their home games at the Cow Palace (former home of their NHL affiliate, the San Jose Sharks), which is right on the Daly City/San Francisco border. To accommodate the Bulls, the team spent $2 million installing a new ice system and a custom-made 360-degree wraparound LED video scoreboard with its game presentation system and ten sets of speaker arrays. The center hung video board has a 360 degree view for game presentation and full timekeeping and statistics. The new Colosseo Cube scoreboard had to be custom built by Colosseo USA because of the weight limitations on the 71-year- old building's roof. The Cow Palace made steel support beams and installed them in the rafters to help provide the additional support. On July 11, 2012, the National Hockey League's San Jose Sharks announced that they had entered into an affiliation agreement with the Bulls. The Bulls were the first ice hockey team to represent San Francisco since the San Francisco Spiders of the International Hockey League played only the 1995-96 season before folding. The team made its debut on October 12, 2012, with a 4-3 loss to the Bakersfield Condors in front of a capacity crowd of 8,277 at the Cow Palace. They finished the regular season eighth in the Western Conference with 25 wins, 38 losses, 2 overtime losses, and 7 shootout losses, falling four games to one to the top- seeded Alaska Aces in the first round of the Kelly Cup playoffs. Due to the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Minnesota Wild forward Torrey Mitchell, who was a former San Jose Shark, signed a standard contract with the Bulls on December 31, 2012. He played his first official game as a Bull two days later and scored the only regulation goal for the team in a 2-1 shootout loss at home. On January 20, 2014, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that the Bulls might fold or move the next week. The team folded on January 27, 2014. At the time of their folding, the Bulls were eighth in the Western Conference with 15 wins, 20 losses, 4 overtime losses, and 1 shootout loss, and had a next-to- last attendance average of 2,292 fans per game (eclipsing only the Wheeling Nailers). San Francisco was the third team in ECHL history to fold mid-season after the Augusta Lynx and Fresno Falcons, both of which folded during the 2008–09 season.

In Indonesia, the term toko is used a generic name for any kind of shop or store. For example, in Indonesia, toko roti means a bakery while a toko kelontong sells daily necessities. The term is of Indonesian origin and probably from the Chinese Hokkien loanword to refer a shop. In the Netherlands, the meaning has shifted more specifically to refer to Asian shops and takeaway restaurants. History Tokos have become a common type of shop in Dutch cities since the repatriation of Dutch colonial expats and Indo-Europeans during and after the Indonesian revolution in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

CARE Peru resumed work in 1970. Today, CARE’s programs focus on assisting the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). CARE Peru's contributions were mainly through education, health care, access to safe water, reduction in poverty and hunger. CARE works with the poorest 20% of the population to reduce inequality. Programs have been put in place to achieve their mission. Small Economic Activity Development (SEAD) creates income opportunities and increase economic security for those disadvantage people. SEAD assists them through granting access to business and financial training and resources. This includes access to savings and credits, training and financial services. The emphasis on these programs has centered on organizations of small producers, to build up solidarity among them and their capacity for negotiating with others. They have also promoted alliances with business sectors with corporate social responsibility initiatives. In addition, CARE has also allowed producer families to gain access to credit to assist them in increasing production and gaining access to markets. 50% of this grant will be used to serve as finance cost to these farmers as loans while the rest will finance the cost of linking them to markets. In addition, another project will be targeting small organic cocoa producers to sustain their income and employment with the purpose of reducing income poverty of 1,000 cocoa producers. They will be assisted by strengthening their productivity through management and technical skills. 266 jobs will be created for this project and 199 after the project excluding the 120 technical assistance jobs. One of the biggest impediments in overcoming income poverty for the poor is the access to credit in line with their characteristics and capacity. In 1998, CARE Peru assisted with the establishment of EDYFICAR, a financial entity to provide financial services to low-income sectors. In 2007, the Inter-American Development Bank ranked EDYFICAR ninth among the top 100 micro-finance institutions in Latin America. In 2009, its portfolio reached US$194 million, serving people in 13 regions in Peru. Also, the Banco de Crédito del Perú – the largest bank in the country – managed to acquire the majority stake in EDYFICAR. Since then, it has operated under the model of financial services aimed at the lowest income segments of the population. CARE and its partners have also influenced decision-makers in the public sector. For example CARE and the Ministry of Agriculture demonstrated that small farmers with less than 3 hectares of land could be linked to existing markets, and therefore should be included in the compensation program that the government established after signing the Free Trade Agreement with the United States. Between 2005-2010, CARE worked with 58, 570 households in the poorest and most excluded highland regions of the country, contributing to reduce the percentage of the population living with less than US$1 per day from 84% to 63%. Statistic from National Institute of Statistics and Information showed that the percentage of poor Peru has dropped from 54.8% in 2001 to 31.3% in 2010 and poverty has fallen by 23.5 percentage points over the last decade.

His name is associated with the introduction of Shorthorn stock into Australia. The year 1831 was a milestone in that it saw the first Beef Shorthorn bull registered in Coates’ Herd Book brought to Australia. The importer was the Van Diemen’s Land Company, Tasmania. There is some confusion as to which breeder imported the first Coates’ Herd Book bull to the mainland. Expert opinion leans towards Mr Thomas Icely of Coombing Park, Carcour, New South Wales who imported a red bull in the mid-1830’s.

She was purported to have lived during the Transition from Sui to Tang and was originally described in Biography of the Dragon-Beard Man from the Tang Dynasty. She was a courtesan in the court of Sui Dynasty minister Yang Su and eloped with Li Jing, an ally and future general of future Tang emperor Li Shimin. Hongfu, along with Li Jing and the \\"Dragon Beard Man,\\" Qiu Ranke, are known as the \\"Three Heroes of the Wind and Dust\\" (風塵三俠). She was one of the few female martial arts masters. Legend thumb Born Zhang Chuchen, her parents were from southern China who migrated north to Chang'an in the unification wars of the Sui Dynasty. Zhang became a courtesan in the court of Sui minister Yang Su, where she specialized in song and dance. Because she often wore red, she became known as Hongfu, or Red Sleeves. According to legend, she saw Li Jing when he came to petition Yang Su to address the grievances of the common people. Zhang fell in love with Li and eloped with him. Hongfu and Li Jing first allied themselves with Qiu Ranke to overthrow the Sui Dynasty, becoming the Three Heroes of the Wind and Dust. After meeting future emperor Li Shimin, Qiu Ranke forsook this ambition. Hongfu and Li Jing allied themselves with Li Shimin and helped Li Shimin and his father Li Yuan establish the Tang Dynasty. Qiu Ranke on went to establish his own kingdom of Fusu (alternatively, Fuyu) to the southeast. Hongfu and Li Jing lived together as wife and husband until she died of illness in AD 640. Li Jing, then 70 years of age, survived her by nine years. In popular culture The story of Hongfu first appears in the Tang Dynasty book Biography of the Dragon-Beard Man by Du Guangting. She is also alluded to in Dream of the Red Chamber when Lin Daiyu is compared to Hongfu. Hongfu is also one of the main characters in the 1966 novel Heroes of the Red Dust (風塵三俠) by author Gao Yang.

In 1972 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Still, St. John is an active parish in the Episcopal Diocese of Milwaukee. Its current priest is the Rev. Philip J. Cunningham. Background  St John's was built from 1851 to 1853, a wooden structure with Gothic Revival style typified in the vertical emphasis and the pointed arches on the openings. Local tradition holds that Ralston Cox, a founder of the congregation, designed the church, With but Richard Perrin, an architectural historian, argues that the design is based on one from Richard Upjohn's book Upjohn's Rural Architecture: Designs, Working Drawings, and Specifications for Wooden Church, and other Rural Structures. Perrin observes that the shape and size of the main structure, the location of pulpit, organ and choir stalls inside, the triple window, and the detail of the interior woodwork are all very close to Upjohn's design. The only major difference is that Upjohn included a tower on the church, whereas St. John's has the bell house as a freestanding structure. Some of the ornamental detail also was added by local craftsmen. Carpenter Alden Kelly added the bargeboards with incised designs and the rood screen inside the church. Blacksmith Jacob Luther forged the wrought-iron hinges to suggest tree branches. Father James DeKoven served as the parish's first rector from 1855 until 1859. Bishop Jackson Kemper consecrated the building on May 20, 1856. On February 23, 1972, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.St. John Chrysostom websiteSt. John Chrysostom historySt. John Chrysostom tour Notable previous clergy include Arthur Anton Vogel, fifth bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of West Missouri, who served as rector from 1953 to 1957.

The six episodes were first broadcast on BBC Three and BBC HD beginning 21 September 2011 and on BBC America from 14 January 2012. In April 2012, Johnny Harris confirmed that a second season had not been commissioned. Plot Paul, a student with a history of bedwetting, is haunted by apocalyptic dreams. He is able to see spirits of the dead, known as the Fades, all around him. The Fades cannot be seen, smelt, heard or touched by other humans – they are what is left of humans who have died but have not been able to ascend, because the ascension points on earth have been closing, and few can go through the ones that are still open. Because of this, the Fades left on Earth have become embittered and vengeful toward the human race, and have since developed a way to become partly human again and regain control of touch within the real world. They remain unseen in the world except to those special few like Paul, called \\"Angelics\\", who have the ability to perceive the Fades. Paul finds himself pulled into a conflict between the Angelics and the Fades, trying to prevent the Fades from regaining physical form and destroying the human race. Production The school scenes were filmed at Queens School, Bushey. The majority of the location filming took place in South Oxhey, Oxhey, Watford, Hemel Hempstead, and Hatfield, Hertfordshire.

It is based on a short story by Clements Ripley that first appeared in Hearst's International- Cosmopolitan. The film centers on a young woman returns to the tropical island where her parents were murdered during a voodoo ritual with her daughter and nanny, only to become corrupted by the native's dark rituals. A copy is held at the Library of Congress.Catalog of Holdings The American Film Institute Collection and The United Artists Collection at the Library of Congress c.1978 by The American Film Institute Plot A young girl, Juanita, finds her parents killed in a voodoo ritual on a distant tropical island. She escapes with her life, but when she reaches adulthood, she feels compelled to return to the island, bringing her daughter and nanny with her. Once there, she goes to stay with her uncle who lives on the island. She soon discovers that the natives, who had been using her for voodoo rituals when she was a child, now treat her as a voodoo goddess. In this role, she begins leading their rituals. Any attempt to fight Juanita's influence or to remove her from her position is met with violent force. One person is found dead in a lava pit, while another is found hanged. At one point, Juanita is so overcome by the voodoo curse that she offers her daughter up for sacrifice. Juanita's businessman husband, Stephen, follows her to the island and attempts to travel into the jungle to rescue her, but finds her taking part in a sacrifice of an innocent woman. Although he shoots the high priest of the tribe, Juanita completes the sacrifice herself. Their high priest injured, the natives now plan to murder all of the white people on the island. Stephen takes his daughter and two others into the fortified section of a plantation house. The natives succeed in capturing Stephen and his secretary, Gail, but they are eventually rescued. In the end, Stephen shoots and kills Juanita just as she is about to sacrifice her own daughter.

Release =Home media= Black Moon was released for the first time on DVD by SPE on August 1, 2011. Reception In their 1934 review of the film, The New York Times wrote: \\"Black Moon, although it is strictly studio-made, is admirably equipped to throw a double-bar-relled scare into the innocent entertainment-hunter.\\" James Jay Edwards of FilmFracture gave the film a mostly positive review, commending the film's downplaying of \\"stereotypical conventions\\" associated with the voodoo horror sub-genre, while also noting the predictability of the film's antagonists. Edwards concluded his review by stating, \\"While not one of her more iconic performances, Black Moon is still an impressive film about voodoo zombies, sans the zombies.\\" On his website Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings, Dave Sindelar commended the film for its \\"brooding atmosphere\\", unpredictability, and Muse's performance; while also noting the film's unevenness, and Wray's character existing \\"more for the sake of convenience than for anything else\\".

However, he also pursued experimental film-making as an amateur beginning in the 1930s.Nancy Doyle -- Artist Profile: Joseph Cornell Cornell was the principal pioneer of collage films in a purely artistic senseLynda Roscoe Hartigan -- Joseph Cornell: Navigating the Imagination. Yale University Press, 2007. Walker Art Center: Rose Hobart and, although the introduction of his films into the public forum was relatively late compared to when they were made, his work as a filmmaker has been widely influential.Wiki on Found footage History Joseph Cornell began to collect films on 16mm in the 1920s, mainly to entertain his mother and disabled brother at the family home in Queens, where Cornell lived for two thirds of his life. To vary the program and to surprise his family, Cornell began to alter his films slightly by adding shots, or changing the endings to films with which they were familiar. This led, in time, to his first and most elaborate film collage, Rose Hobart (1936), coincidentally concurrent with his first box, Soap Bubble Set (1936), later sold to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Recently discovered correspondence between Cornell and Iris Barry of MoMA's film library reveals that he was already conversant with language relevant to the then emerging field of film preservation and was also occasionally collecting films in 35mm nitrate.Anne Morra -- Pen Pals: Iris Barry and Joseph Cornell The first screening of Rose Hobart at the Museum's Julien Levy Gallery in 1936 led to a violent conflict with Surrealist painter Salvador Dalí, who accused Cornell of stealing his ideas.NFPF: Rose Hobart Cornell, who was naturally shy, was deeply affected by this incident and seldom showed his films afterward. Apart from a special screening held at a Christmas party at the New York Public Library in 1957,Jeanne Liotta -- Joseph Cornell Films these were usually given in connection with regular art gallery showings of his boxes; even today they are most often seen in connection with exhibits of static visual work, although Cornell disclaimed any relationship between these two aspects of his endeavors. After a long break from film- making starting at about the beginning of World War II, Cornell resumed work in this area in the mid-1950s.Smithsonian Archives of American Art -- Jennifer Meehan: A Finding Aid to the Joseph Cornell Papers Rather than using found footage, Cornell began to work with collaborators, cameras and some actors, making films with Rudy Burckhardt,Rudy Burckhardt Obituary from The Independent the young Stan Brakhage and finally Larry Jordan, who completed six of Cornell's earlier films at the artist's request, in addition to making a new version of A Fable for Fountains (1957) retitled A Legend for Fountains (1965).Lawrence C. Jordan Biography About 1961, Cornell stopped his film- making activity and production of new boxes, devoting himself to repairing boxes already made, a return to 2-D collage, completing films already made and the production of one more film. In 1969, Cornell donated his film collection, consisting of some 150 reels, to the Anthology Film Archives in New York. Although the collection consisted mainly of entertainment films distributed to the home market in the 1920s and 1930s, a few additional reels were discovered that appeared to constitute previously unknown projects, but Cornell's declining health in his last years and his subsequent death in 1972 prevented him from being asked about specific intentions in regard to most of them. He did leave extensive notes relating to some of these films; and these have been used to help complete certain titles. In some cases, titles—such as Thimble Theater—were devised to identify films that had none. Cornell may have worked on as many as 30 or more films,Jay Babcock -- Joseph Cornell Screenings in L.A., Arthur Magazine, 12-5-2005 but it is difficult to tell in some cases whether a reel's contents constitutes an actual assemblage or is merely a collection of trims; scholars generally agree that the 27 titles listed below constitute actual projects. The provenance of The Children's Jury is more difficult to establish, and therefore it is regarded as \\"attributed\\" to Cornell. The first detailed appreciation of Cornell's film-making activity in print was an article by Jonas Mekas, \\"The Invisible Cathedrals of Joseph Cornell,\\" published in the Village Voice in 1970. Screenings of Cornell's films on a regular and semi-regular basis began from that time. Anthology Film Archives maintains two programs of Cornell's films as part of its rotating Essential Cinema series; they have been widely seen in film series and as part of traveling exhibitions and collected onto the DVDs shown below. TCM's airing of Rose Hobart in 2008 represented the first major showing of a Joseph Cornell film on television. Dating Cornell did not date his films, and dating them accurately has proven a persistent problem; as much of it involved found film that was already old -- Rose Hobart, for example, was derived from a \\"junk\\" 16mm print of the 1931 feature East of Borneo—there is little internal evidence as to when he may have been involved in a particular project. Rose Hobart is dated by virtue of its Julian Levy Gallery screening, but that does not exclude the possibility that Cornell may have made changes in it, or any other film that he made, some time later. Scholarly consensus shows that Cornell made his films in two basic batches; the collage films were made between 1936 and roughly the beginning of World War II or slightly after, and the second, \\"photographic\\" phase between 1954 and 1965. In the list below, the convention of \\"1940s\\" developed by Anthology Film Archives in observed for the earlier films, though with the understanding that the late 1930s is more likely. In recent times, a date of 1938 is associated specifically with the films in The Children's Trilogy. Style and influence Cornell's style is remarkably consistent among his collage and photographic films, and although he discouraged drawing a parallel between them and his visual art the harmony in approach is obvious. Surrealist juxtapositions between shots abound, much as disparate objects exist side by side within his boxes, and the result is often amusing even if one cannot divine why. In contrast to the rapid fire montage of later filmmakers in the collage medium, such as Bruce Conner and Stan Vanderbeek, Cornell's pace is slow, even \\"cool,\\" and helped to keep his films different and fresh even as they were not widely seen until after 1970. Some viewers find them boring and inscrutable, but Cornell was making his films primarily to entertain himself and his family; not showing them publicly left Cornell free to develop his own methods independently of trends observed among other experimental filmmakers of his time. Cornell was a direct influence on Brakhage and Jordan, Ken Jacobs and Jack Smith.P. Adams Sitney -- Visionary Film: The American Avant-Garde 1943-2000. Oxford University Press, USA, 2000 (Third Edition). Avant-garde filmmakers of a later era, such as Jeanne Liotta—who has authored an extensive essay on Cornell—Lewis Khlar, Janie Geiser, Stephanie Barber and Brian Frye claim Cornell as a major influence on their work. Several of Cornell's titles share footage, and some represent alternative views of the same project. Cloche a Travers les Feuilles is a shorter, variant version of Nymphlight with the Debussy piece of that name added as a soundtrack. The footage in The Children's Trilogy is all of a related kind, and repetition is an important technique in this cycle, with a shot of a child falling asleep repeated several times in The Children's Party. Gnir Rednow is an alternate reading of Stan Brakhage's The Wonder Ring (1955) which Cornell \\"commissioned\\" with the gift of two bus tokens; it is so close to Brakhage's film some suggested that it was no more than The Wonder Ring played backwards, but analysis reveals that the two films share no common shots, and that Cornell worked only with the trims. Few of Cornell's films have dedicated soundtracks; the standard soundtrack to Rose Hobart consists of an album of Latin music which Cornell once used, and even that was an arbitrary replacement for the 78 rpm records he utilized in the 1930s. While the soundtrack for Rose Hobart has a distancing and dissonant effect in combination with the film, the Beethoven symphony Cornell chose for Carousel -- Animal Opera deepens its sense of tragedy. Unfortunately, he didn't leave many notes in regard to what kinds of sound that he wanted to use with his films, and never made a synchronized track to any of them himself. Lawrence Jordan was able to complete the soundtrack to Jack's Dream around 1970, working from instructions from Cornell himself, and some accompaniments were commissioned by Anthology's Bruce Posner for the Unseen Cinema DVD set and its touring version as well. But the vast majority of Cornell's films are shown without sound. Complete filmography All films made originally in 16mm.
