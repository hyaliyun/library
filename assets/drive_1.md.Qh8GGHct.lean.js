Life He was the eldest son of Robert Mendham, a merchant in Walbrook, London, who died at Highgate, Middlesex, 7 April 1810, aged 77, leaving a widow, who died there on 11 October 1812, at the age of 78. He matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, on 27 January 1789, and graduated B.A. 1792, M.A. 1795. In 1793 he was ordained a deacon in the Church of England, and in 1794 priest. Early in 1795, Mendham accepted the curacy of Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire. His sole preferment seems to have been the incumbency of Hill Chapel in Arden, Warwickshire, to which he was licensed on 22 August 1836. In this district of Warwickshire the rest of his life was spent, and he died at Sutton Coldfield on 1 November 1856, aged 87. Works Mendham studied the points of controversy between Catholicism and its Protestant opponents. He wrote: * ‘An Exposition of the Lord's Prayer,’ 1803. * ‘Clavis Apostolica, or a Key to the Apostolic Writings,’ 1821.

He contributed to Notes and Queries, the Protestant Journal, and Christian Observer. Articles by him in the Church of England Quarterly Review were printed separately. Mendham collected a library of controversial theology. This came to his nephew, the Rev. John Mendham, on whose death his widow, Sophia, placed the books at the disposal of Charles Hastings Collette, solicitor in Lincoln's Inn Fields, by whom a selection was made and presented to the Incorporated Law Society in Chancery Lane, London. These are described in a printed catalogue dated 1871, and in a supplement which was issued in 1874. It contained many sermons and pamphlets by him.

It is structurally similar to the much more common mineral olivine. Maricite is brittle, usually colorless to gray, and has been found in nodules within shale beds often containing other minerals. Maricite is most commonly known to be found in the Big Fish River area of the Yukon Territory, Canada, but it has also been found in Eastern Germany, as well as inside of various meteorites around the world. Maricite is named after Luka Maric (1899–1979) of Croatia, the longtime head of the mineralogy and petrography departments at the University of Zagreb. Maricite is a sodium iron phosphate from the extremely diverse phosphate mineral group. In 1977 maricite was discovered in the Big Fish River area, Yukon Territory, Canada (Fleischer, Chao, and Mandarino, 1979). This is an important geologic location that has provided the discovery of several new phosphate minerals. Maricite is recognized for its possible use in sodium ion battery research as well as its role as a reaction product inside of fossil- fired electrical power generating station boilers which experience corrosion (Bridson, et al., 1997; Ong, et al., 2011). Composition Maricite is a member of the phosphate mineral group. Phosphate minerals have one or more metal cations bonded to the phosphate anion PO4. (Hawthorne, F.C., 1998). In maricite the metals bonded to PO4 are sodium and iron (Sturman, et al., 1977). The empirical formula for maricite is NaFePO4 and it has a molar mass of 173.81 g/mol (Yahia, et al., 2008; Tremaine, Xiao, 1999). The general formula for maricite is ABPO4, (Yahia, et al., 2008). The chemical composition of the mineral was originally determined by the group of Dr. Corlett from the Department of Geological Sciences at Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario, using electron microprobe analysis, and found to be Na 0.91(Fe 0.89 Mn 0.07 Mg 0.03)P 1.02 O 4.00 (Sturman, et al., 1977) when normalized to four oxygen atoms. The weight percentages were determined using six different points on a thin section and averaging the percentages of each oxide in all of the samples. The results in weight percent average of oxides are as follows: Na2O 16.5%, MgO 0.8%, CaO 0.0%, MnO 3.1%, FeO 37.4%, P2O5 42.5%, with a total of 100.3%. When looking at these results, one may determine that the majority of the oxide weight composition is made of FeO with P2O5 making up almost the same weight percentage. There is a significant percentage of the Na2O oxide and an insignificant percentage of the CaO oxide (~0). It is clear from looking at the oxide content of the mineral that the main components are going to be sodium, iron, phosphorus, and oxygen. The oxide factor may be used to determine the weight percentages of the individual elements as follows, 1 sodium atom totaling ~13% of composition, 1 iron atom totaling ~32% of composition, 1 phosphorus atom totaling ~18% of composition, and 4 oxygen atoms totaling ~37% of composition (Sturman, et al., 1977). Structure Maricite is an ionic double metal phosphate, with a space filling capacity of about 70% (Le Page, and Donnay, 1977). The structure of maricite contains a sodium cation enclosed by ten oxygen anions within 10 Å, in an irregular coordination. There is (2+2+2) type distorted tetrahedron around the iron (Bridson, et al., 1997). The Å distances between iron and oxygen are between 2.33-2.93. The phosphate tetrahedron is almost regular, with 2 short bonds and 2 longer bonds (Bridson, et al., 1997). The iron atom has four surrounding oxygen atoms giving it tetrahedral coordination. Half of the oxygen atoms are coordinated with two sodium atoms, two iron atoms, and one phosphorus atom while the other half are coordinated with three sodium atoms, one iron atom and one phosphorus atom (Bridson, et al., 1997). The structure of maricite has been compared to the structure of olivine, (Lee, et al., 2011). The structures of the two minerals are similar because they both contain PO4 in their atomic make-up (Moreau, et al., 2010). However, the M1 and M2 sites for LiFePO4 and NaFePO4 have reverse occupancies making their structures different (Lee, et al., 2011). In olivine, the M1 site holds the alkali metal while the M2 site holds the transition metal, whereas in maricite, the M1 site holds the transition metal and the M2 site holds the alkali metal (Ong, et al., 2011). Physical properties Maricite (NaFePO4), is found in elongated grains up to 15 cm long in the [100] direction. The grains are radial to sub parallel in structure. Maricite is usually colorless to gray, but is sometimes a pale brown color and it has a white streak. It has a vitreous luster due to its low values of refractive indices, α = 1.676 β = 1.695 γ = 1.698, and its opacity is transparent to translucent (Fleisher, et al., 1979). Maricite has no cleavage or pleochroism, and it does not fluoresce in UV light. Maricite has a hardness of 4-4.5 and a density of 3.64. The mineral is brittle, with an uneven splintery fracture. It is a member of the orthorhombic crystal class and the biaxial negative optical class and has a 2V calculation of 43°. The Hermann-Mauguin notation symbol is 2/m 2/m 2/m, and it is in the Pmnb space group. Yvon Le Page and Gabrielle Donnay determined that the cell dimensions are a 6.864(2), b 8.994(2), and c 5.049(1). J. A. Mandarino determined the d-spacings using x-ray powder diffraction and Bragg’s law to be 2.574 at an intensity of 100, 2.729 at an intensity of 90, 2.707 at an intensity of 80, 1.853 at an intensity of 60, 3.705 at an intensity of 40, 2.525 at an intensity of 30, and 1.881 also at an intensity of 30 (Fleisher, et al., 1979; Sturman, et al., 1977). Geologic occurrence Maricite was first discovered in the Big Fish River area near the eastern border of the Yukon Territory around Latitude 68° 30’ N and Longitude 136° 30’ W. This area is a kulanite- baricite-peniksite type locality composed mostly of bedded shales and sideritic limestones. Maricite has been found in nodules up to 15 cm long within the shale beds. Some of the nodules contained only one mineral, while others contained several different minerals. Very few of the nodules consisted of only maricite. Most of the samples which contained maricite also had quartz, ludlamite, vivianite, pyrite and/or wolfeite. When samples which appeared to only contain maricite were examined closely in a thin section, there were small inclusions of ludlamite, quartz, and vivianite present along the fractures (Sturman, et al., 1977). The other location which formations of maricite have been found is Saxony, Germany (Thomas, R. and Webster J.D., 2000). Both this location and the Big Fish River Canada location are situated just north of convergent plate boundaries. Both areas consist of mountains and hills which are made of metamorphic and igneous rocks (Thomas, R. and Webster J.D., 2000; Sturman, et al., 1977). Maricite has also been discovered in meteorites found in Eastern Antarctica, Uttar Pradesh, India and Avannaa, Greenland (Johnson, et al., 2001; Kracher, et al., 1977; Partridge, et al., 1990). History Maricite was named by Darko Sturman and Joseph Mandarino in honor of Luka Maric. Maric was the longtime head of the department of mineralogy and petrography at the University of Zagreb in Croatia. The name Maricite was approved in 1977 by the commission on new minerals and mineral names. It is unclear exactly why the mineral was named in honor of Maric, but he did author several geology books including one entitled Magmatiti u Uzhem Podruchju Rudnika Bor u Istochnoj Srbiji, which is Croatian for Magmatites in the Narrower Ore Deposit Region of the Bor Mine (Sturman, et al., 1977).

The Ultra 60 is similar to the higher-cost Sun Ultra 80, but is somewhat smaller and supports fewer CPUs and less memory. The Ultra 60 may be rack-mounted using an optional kit (X9627A or 560-2548) although they were generally not rack-mounted, since the Ultra 60 was designed for use as a workstation rather than a server. Details can be found in the Sun Ultra 80 Rack Mount Installation Guide. The Enterprise 220R is an Ultra 60 motherboard in a specialized rackmount case with custom power supplies and other parts. The Ultra 60 is no longer sold new and was replaced by the Ultra 45. The last order date for the Ultra 60 was July 2002 and the last model to be shipped was in 2003, so it is now considered by Sun to be end of life. Operating system Although it shipped with Solaris 7, the Ultra 60 will run later versions of Solaris up to 10, as well as Linux and FreeBSD. The Ultra 60 can not run Microsoft Windows directly, although an internal PCI card (SunPCi II pro and similar) from Sun could be fitted to allow the use of Windows. Hardware specifications and notes Full specifications can no longer be found on the Oracle web site, but these abbreviated specification, along with some extra notes that are likely to be useful are given below. CPU The Ultra 60 came equipped with 1 or 2 CPUs. The CPUs run at 300,360,450 MHz and have 16-KB data and 16-KB instruction cache on chip with a 2MB or 4MB external secondary cache (secondary cache size depends on CPU model). Memory The Ultra 60 uses 144-pin 5V 60-ns DIMM memory modules of either 32, 64, or 128 MB which should be installed in sets of four identical DIMMs. There are 16 DIMM sockets, so it is possible to fit up to 2 GB with 16 128-MB modules. The memory bus is 576 bits wide; 512 bits are used for data and 64 bits for error correction. The specifications give the maximum throughput of 1.78-GB/s. Performance is improved if 2-way interleaving is used (giving 512 MB or 2 GB). Internal storage The Ultra 60 takes one or two 1\\" high SCA SCSI disk drives internally. It was sold with 18.2-GB or 36.4-GB disks, but can in practice use any SCA disk. The internal disks must be mounted in a carrier or spud-bracket (Sun part number 540-3024). The SCSI IDs of the internal disks are 0 and 3. These are set by the SCA backplane and can not be changed. An optional 1.44 MB 3.5\\" MS-DOS/IBM compatible floppy drive can be fitted. An optional 644 MB SunCD 32X-speed, Photo CD compatible CD-ROM drive or an optional 10X DVD-ROM could be specified as well.

The most commonly used approaches are the transit-time methods and the interferometer methods based upon the speed of light. For objects such as crystals and diffraction gratings, diffraction is used with X-rays and electron beams. Measurement techniques for three-dimensional structures very small in every dimension use specialized instruments such as ion microscopy coupled with intensive computer modeling. For a discussion of astronomical methods for determining cosmological distances, see the article Cosmic distance ladder.  Standard rulers  The ruler the simplest kind of length measurement tool: lengths are defined by printed marks or engravings on a stick. The meter was initially defined using a ruler before more accurate methods became available. Gauge blocks are a common method for precise measurement or calibration of measurement tools. For small or microscopic objects, microphotography where the length is calibrated using a graticule can be used. A graticule is a piece that has lines for precise lengths etched into it. Graticules may be fitted into the eyepiece or they may be used on the measurement plane. Transit-time measurement The basic idea behind a transit-time measurement of length is to send a signal from one end of the length to be measured to the other, and back again. The time for the round trip is the transit time Δt, and the length ℓ is then 2ℓ = Δt*\\"v\\",with v the speed of propagation of the signal, assuming that is the same in both directions. If light is used for the signal, its speed depends upon the medium in which it propagates; in SI units the speed is a defined value c0 in the reference medium of classical vacuum. Thus, when light is used in a transit-time approach, length measurements are not subject to knowledge of the source frequency (apart from possible frequency dependence of the correction to relate the medium to classical vacuum), but are subject to the error in measuring transit times, in particular, errors introduced by the response times of the pulse emission and detection instrumentation. An additional uncertainty is the refractive index correction relating the medium used to the reference vacuum, taken in SI units to be the classical vacuum. A refractive index of the medium larger than one slows the light. Transit-time measurement underlies most radio navigation systems for boats and aircraft, for example, radar and the nearly obsolete Long Range Aid to Navigation LORAN-C. For example, in one radar system, pulses of electromagnetic radiation are sent out by the vehicle (interrogating pulses) and trigger a response from a responder beacon. The time interval between the sending and the receiving of a pulse is monitored and used to determine a distance. In the global positioning system a code of ones and zeros is emitted at a known time from multiple satellites, and their times of arrival are noted at a receiver along with the time they were sent (encoded in the messages). Assuming the receiver clock can be related to the synchronized clocks on the satellites, the transit time can be found and used to provide the distance to each satellite. Receiver clock error is corrected by combining the data from four satellites. Such techniques vary in accuracy according to the distances over which they are intended for use. For example, LORAN-C is accurate to about GPS about enhanced GPS, in which a correction signal is transmitted from terrestrial stations (that is, differential GPS (DGPS)) or via satellites (that is, Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)) can bring accuracy to a few meters or or, in specific applications, tens of centimeters. Time-of-flight systems for robotics (for example, Laser Detection and Ranging LADAR and Light Detection and Ranging LIDAR) aim at lengths of and have an accuracy of about Interferometer measurements Measuring a length in wavelengths of light using an interferometer. In many practical circumstances, and for precision work, measurement of dimension using transit-time measurements is used only as an initial indicator of length and is refined using an interferometer. Generally, transit time measurements are preferred for longer lengths, and interferometers for shorter lengths. The figure shows schematically how length is determined using a Michelson interferometer: the two panels show a laser source emitting a light beam split by a beam splitter (BS) to travel two paths. The light is recombined by bouncing the two components off a pair of corner cubes (CC) that return the two components to the beam splitter again to be reassembled. The corner cube serves to displace the incident from the reflected beam, which avoids some complications caused by superposing the two beams. The distance between the left-hand corner cube and the beam splitter is compared to that separation on the fixed leg as the left-hand spacing is adjusted to compare the length of the object to be measured. In the top panel the path is such that the two beams reinforce each other after reassembly, leading to a strong light pattern (sun). The bottom panel shows a path that is made a half wavelength longer by moving the left-hand mirror a quarter wavelength further away, increasing the path difference by a half wavelength. The result is the two beams are in opposition to each other at reassembly, and the recombined light intensity drops to zero (clouds). Thus, as the spacing between the mirrors is adjusted, the observed light intensity cycles between reinforcement and cancellation as the number of wavelengths of path difference changes, and the observed intensity alternately peaks (bright sun) and dims (dark clouds). This behavior is called interference and the machine is called an interferometer. By counting fringes it is found how many wavelengths long the measured path is compared to the fixed leg. In this way, measurements are made in units of wavelengths λ corresponding to a particular atomic transition. The length in wavelengths can be converted to a length in units of metres if the selected transition has a known frequency f. The length as a certain number of wavelengths λ is related to the metre using λ = . With c0 a defined value of 299,792,458 m/s, the error in a measured length in wavelengths is increased by this conversion to metres by the error in measuring the frequency of the light source. By using sources of several wavelengths to generate sum and difference beat frequencies, absolute distance measurements become possible. This methodology for length determination requires a careful specification of the wavelength of the light used, and is one reason for employing a laser source where the wavelength can be held stable. Regardless of stability, however, the precise frequency of any source has linewidth limitations. Other significant errors are introduced by the interferometer itself; in particular: errors in light beam alignment, collimation and fractional fringe determination. Corrections also are made to account for departures of the medium (for example, air) from the reference medium of classical vacuum. Resolution using wavelengths is in the range of ΔL/L ≈ depending upon the length measured, the wavelength and the type of interferometer used. The measurement also requires careful specification of the medium in which the light propagates. A refractive index correction is made to relate the medium used to the reference vacuum, taken in SI units to be the classical vacuum. These refractive index corrections can be found more accurately by adding frequencies, for example, frequencies at which propagation is sensitive to the presence of water vapor. This way non-ideal contributions to the refractive index can be measured and corrected for at another frequency using established theoretical models. It may be noted again, by way of contrast, that the transit-time measurement of length is independent of any knowledge of the source frequency, except for a possible dependence of the correction relating the measurement medium to the reference medium of classical vacuum, which may indeed depend on the frequency of the source. Where a pulse train or some other wave-shaping is used, a range of frequencies may be involved. Diffraction measurements For small objects, different methods are used that also depend upon determining size in units of wavelengths. For instance, in the case of a crystal, atomic spacings can be determined using X-ray diffraction. The present best value for the lattice parameter of silicon, denoted a, is: ::a = 543.102 0504(89) × 10−12 m, corresponding to a resolution of ΔL/L ≈ Similar techniques can provide the dimensions of small structures repeated in large periodic arrays like a diffraction grating. Such measurements allow the calibration of electron microscopes, extending measurement capabilities. For non-relativistic electrons in an electron microscope, the de Broglie wavelength is: :\\\\lambda_e = \\\\frac{h}{\\\\sqrt{2m_e e V}} \\\\ , with V the electrical voltage drop traversed by the electron, me the electron mass, e the elementary charge, and h the Planck constant. This wavelength can be measured in terms of inter-atomic spacing using a crystal diffraction pattern, and related to the metre through an optical measurement of the lattice spacing on the same crystal. This process of extending calibration is called metrological traceability. See The use of metrological traceability to connect different regimes of measurement is similar to the idea behind the cosmic distance ladder for different ranges of astronomical length. Both calibrate different methods for length measurement using overlapping ranges of applicability. Other techniques Measuring dimensions of localized structures (as opposed to large arrays of atoms like a crystal), as in modern integrated circuits, is done using the scanning electron microscope. This instrument bounces electrons off the object to be measured in a high vacuum enclosure, and the reflected electrons are collected as a photodetector image that is interpreted by a computer. These are not transit-time measurements, but are based upon comparison of Fourier transforms of images with theoretical results from computer modeling. Such elaborate methods are required because the image depends on the three- dimensional geometry of the measured feature, for example, the contour of an edge, and not just upon one- or two-dimensional properties. The underlying limitations are the beam width and the wavelength of the electron beam (determining diffraction), determined, as already discussed, by the electron beam energy. and The calibration of these scanning electron microscope measurements is tricky, as results depend upon the material measured and its geometry. A typical wavelength is and a typical resolution is about Other small dimension techniques are the atomic force microscope, the focused ion beam and the helium ion microscope. Calibration is attempted using standard samples measured by transmission electron microscope (TEM). Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) is a specialized type of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy where distances between atoms can be measured. It is based on the effect where nuclear spin cross-relaxation after excitation by a radio pulse depends on the distance between the nuclei. Unlike spin-spin coupling, NOE propagates through space and does not require that the atoms are connected by bonds, so it is a true distance measurement instead of a chemical measurement. Unlike diffraction measurements, NOESY does not require a crystalline sample, but is done in solution state and can be applied to substances that are difficult to crystallize. Other systems of units In some systems of units, unlike the current SI system, lengths are fundamental units (for example, wavelengths in the older SI units and bohrs in atomic units) and are not defined by times of transit.

Location Kimwenza is on a plateau above the main city of Kinshasa. It is near to the Petites Chutes de la Lukaya. It is a station on the Matadi–Kinshasa Railway, built between 1890 and 1898 to connect Matadi with Kinshasa, bypassing the unnavigable Livingstone Falls. Religious establishments In June 1893, Jesuits settled on the Ndjili River in what is now Masina. They were the first Catholic missionaries in the area. Within a month they moved away from the unhealthy, swampy conditions that they found, to Kimwenza. The Saint Mary's mission, founded in July 1893, included a school to train African boys destined for the army or the priesthood. The Jesuits felt it was essential for nuns to come and work with the local women and children, believing that Christianity would only take root if the women of the family were believers. The Sisters of Our Lady of Namur set up a school there, in 1894. By 1900, the Jesuit priests were educating 100 boys, and the nuns had 169 girls. While the priests always saw one of their goals as being to educate trainee priests, the sisters were at first only concerned with teaching Christianity to future wives and mothers. In the early 1920s, local women also began to ask to join the sisters. The mission was the origin for numerous religious houses and schools. The Lycée de Kimwenza is now one of the best regarded schools of the city. The Soeurs Clarisses had a convent at Kimwenza. During the troubles of 1996, it was ransacked by Rwandan soldiers. University In October 1951 the Kisantu University was moved to Kimwenza. The new location had the advantage of being closer to Leopoldville. However, a site further north about in size on the crest called Mont Amba had the advantage of being even closer to the city, and in April 1952 the governor general Eugène Jungers ceded ownership of the site to the university. In July 1954 the university was placed under the direction of the Jesuits of the Catholic University of Louvain, and named Lovanium University. While the Jesuits aimed to educate an African elite, the Belgian colonial administration was hostile to this goal, and it was only in 1956 that they recognized the university. After independence it was to become the University of Kinshasa. Lola ya Bonobo sanctuary Since 2002, the Lola ya Bonobo sanctuary, founded by Claudine André, has been located just south of Kimwenza at the Petites Chutes de la Lukaya. Bonobos are an endangered species which only exist in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the wild. They are the great ape most closely related to humans, and even more intelligent than chimpanzees. Lola ya Bonobo means 'paradise for bonobos' in Lingala, the main language of Kinshasa. In 2012, Lola ya Bonobo was home to 60 bonobos who live in 30 hectares of primary forest. Typically, bonobos arrive as young infants. The bushmeat trade in Congo sees hundreds of bonobos killed each year for meat and the infants are sold as pets. When confiscated, these infant bonobos are taken to Lola ya Bonobo. They begin life at the sanctuary with close care from a substitute human mother, but are usually quickly ready to be integrated into a peer group, and shortly afterwards into one of the large mixed-age social groups.

Early years Gaplanov was born to a royal Kumyk knyaz family in the village of Aksay, currently in Khasavyurtovsky District, Dagestan. He completed his secondary education in a Vladikavkaz Realny School. In 1910, he graduated from the Law Department of Sorbonne University in 1910. He then taught at Istanbul University in Turkey. In 1913, he returned to Vladikavkaz and worked as an attorney in a regional court. In 1918, upon establishment of Cherkes-Dagestan Republic and Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus, he held several ministerial positions within their governments. After Denikin forces invaded those republics bringing them under Russian rule, Gaplanov moved to Baku, Azerbaijan in early 1919. Political career In Baku, Gaplanov joined Ahrar Party and was elected to the Azerbaijani Parliament. When the fourth cabinet of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was formed on 14 April 1919 under Prime Minister Nasib Yusifbeyli, he was appointed the Minister of Education and Religious Affairs. As the Minister of Education, he played an important role in establishing institutions of higher education in Azerbaijan, among them the largest Baku State University, where he also taught a course on Ottoman literature himself. He reportedly increased funding for the university to AZM 5 million to open a Phylology and Medicine departments. In 1919, Gaplanov arranged funding for 100 Azerbaijani students to study at universities abroad. He also spearheaded establishment of State Commission on General Education Reforms which eventually introduced the Azerbaijani alphabet based on Latin script. Gaplanov remained in the office until December 22 of the same year, when the new fifth government was formed, where he took the position of Minister of Finance. He served as Minister of Finance until 1 April 1920. After the Red Army invasion of Azerbaijan on 28 April 1920, Azerbaijan Democratic Republic ceased to exist. Gaplanov was subsequently arrested in June 1920 along with many Azerbaijani statesmen and sent to Moscow prison. He was later released and taught a course on Turkish History at the Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies. Gaplanov was arrested as a part of the Great Purge on 8 October 1937 and imprisoned at Butyrskaya and then Lefortovo prisons. He was executed on 10 December 1937.

History Silversurfers is the term widely used in the UK, Australia and some other English speaking countries to describe people who are aged over 50 and who use the internet on a frequent basis. The number of older users has increased dramatically over the past several years due to their being more accustomed to the technology. It has been determined that this age group uses the internet on average four hours more per month than the age group 18–24, and spend a majority of their time using search engines and online shopping sites. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1561089/Silver-surfers-take-over-the- internet.html Other sources indicate that this growing trend among the older population is due to the increase in use of social networking sites to stay in touch with family members or close friends that live far away.https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/09/marketing-to-the- silver-surfer Studies point to Skype, Facebook, email, and instant messaging are all highlighted as commonly used, mainly because the means for communicating have become more available and free. While the rise in internet use among the younger population has led to fears of isolation, it is argued that the increase in use for the older population has done the exact opposite. A study was conducted that surveyed over 8,000 individuals over the age of 50 on the extent of their social-networking use. The results showed that individuals who used the internet more consistently were 1/3 less likely to be depressed. Depression for this age group is argued to arise from lack of mobility and feeling out of touch, but the ability to keep close contact has reversed this phenomenon - internet use is thought to increase avenues of communication and feelings of independence. A separate study analyzed the brain function of individuals after using the internet for a week, and found that it improved nerve function in the older group.

Intra-action, a neologism introduced by Barad, signals an important challenge to individualist metaphysics. For Barad, phenomena or objects do not precede their interaction, rather, 'objects' emerge through particular intra- actions. Thus, apparatuses, which produce phenomena, are not assemblages of humans and nonhumans (as in actor-network theory). Rather, they are the condition of possibility of 'humans' and 'non-humans', not merely as ideational concepts, but in their materiality. Apparatuses are 'material- discursive' in that they produce determinate meanings and material beings while simultaneously excluding the production of others. What it means to matter is therefore always material-discursive. Barad takes her inspiration from physicist Niels Bohr, one of the founders of quantum physics. Barad's agential realism is at once an epistemology (theory of knowing), an ontology (theory of being), and an ethics. For this, Barad employs the term onto- epistemology. Because specific practices of mattering have ethical consequences, excluding other kinds of mattering, onto-epistemological practices are always in turn onto-ethico-epistemological. Much of Barad's scholarly work has revolved around her concept of \\"agential realism,\\" and her theories hold importance for many academic fields, including science studies, STS (Science, Technology, and Society), feminist technoscience, philosophy of science, feminist theory, and, of course, physics. In addition to Bohr, her work draws a great deal on the works of Michel Foucault and Judith Butler, as demonstrated in her influential article in the feminist journal differences, \\"Getting Real: Technoscientific Practices and the Materialization of Reality.\\" Abstract. Barad's original training was in theoretical physics. Her book, Meeting the Universe Halfway, (2007), includes in-depth discussions of Stern–Gerlach experiments, Bell inequalities, delayed-choice quantum eraser experiments, the Kochen–Specker theorem and other topics in quantum physics from Barad's neo-Bohrian perspective. In this book, Barad also argues that 'agential realism,' is useful to the analysis of literature, social inequalities, and many other things. This claim is based on the fact that Barad's agential realism is a way of understanding the politics, ethics, and agencies of any act of observation, and indeed any kind of knowledge practice. According to Barad, the deeply connected way that everything is entangled with everything else means that any act of observation makes a \\"cut\\" between what is included and excluded from what is being considered. Nothing is inherently separate from anything else, but separations are temporarily enacted so one can examine something long enough to gain knowledge about it. This view of knowledge provides a framework for thinking about how culture and habits of thought can make some things visible and other things easier to ignore or to never see. For this reason, according to Barad, agential realism is useful for any kind of feminist analysis, even if the connection to science is not apparent. Barad's framework makes several other arguments, and some of them are part of larger trends in fields such as science studies and feminist technoscience: * She defines agency as a relationship and not as something that one \\"has.\\" * The scientist is always part of the apparatus, and one needs to understand that his/her participation is needed in order to make scientific work more accurate and more rigorous. This differs from the view that political critiques of science seek to undermine the credibility of science; instead, Barad argues that this kind of critique actually makes for better, more credible science. * She argues that politics and ethical issues are always part of scientific work, and only are made to seem separate by specific historical circumstances that encourage people to fail to see those connections. She uses the example of the ethics of developing nuclear weapons to argue this point, by claiming that the ethics and politics are part of how such weapons were developed and understood, and therefore part of science, and not merely of the \\"philosophy of science\\" or the \\"ethics of science.\\" This differs from the usual view that one can strive for a politics-free, bias-less science. * Nevertheless, she argues against moral relativism, which, according to Barad, uses science's \\"human\\" aspects as an excuse to treat all knowledge, and all ethical frameworks, as equally false. She uses Michael Frayn's play Copenhagen as an example of the kind of moral relativism that she finds problematic. * She also rejects the idea that science is \\"only\\" a language game or set of fictions produced only by human constructions and concepts. Although the scientist is part of the \\"intra-action\\" of the experiment, humans (and their cultural constructs) do not have complete control over everything that happens. Barad expresses this point by saying, in Getting Real, that although scientists shape knowledge about the universe, you can't ignore the way the universe \\"kicks back.\\" These points on science, agency, ethics, and knowledge reveal that Barad's work is similar to the projects of other science studies scholars such as Bruno Latour, Donna Haraway, Andrew Pickering, and Evelyn Fox Keller. Barad's notion of \\"phenomenon\\" has also been compared to analogous concepts in the work of Ian Hacking and Nancy Cartwright. Barad's work has generally been received more positively within feminist technoscience than within mainstream science, technology and society studies (STS).

Dall & Bartsch, Notes on Japanese, Indo-Pacific and American Pyramidellidae; Proceedings of the U.S. National Museum, vol XXX n° 1452; 1906 Description Apertural view of Miralda diadema The white, small shell grows to a length of 1.8 mm. It is subovate, minutely umbilicated, with the summits of the whorls decidedly tabulated. The two helicoid whorls of the protoconch are moderately large, and about one-third immersed in the later whorls. The five whorls of the teleoconch are moderately rounded, decidedly tabulated at the summit,. They are ornamented by rounded, axial ribs which quickly diminish in strength as they pass from the summit of the whorls to the periphery. Sixteen of these ribs occur upon the second, and twenty upon the penultimate whorl. The ribs are thickened at the anterior termination of the shoulder and render it decidedly crenulated. The intercostal spaces are a little wider than the ribs. In addition to the axial ribs the whorls are marked by strong spiral cords, two of which can be seen between the sutures on the first and second and four and one-half upon the penultimate whorl. The junction of the posterior one of these two cords and the axial ribs form a series of tubercles. The anterior cord is only slightly tuberculated, the ribs extending only feebly to it. The periphery and the base of the body whorl are well rounded, the latter decidedly attenuated and marked by seven subequal and subequally spaced spiral keels. The suboval aperture is large. The posterior angle is very obtuse. The outer lip is thick. The columella is re-enforced by the attenuated base, curved. It is provided with a conspicuous oblique fold near its insertion. The parietal wall is covered by a moderately thick callus. Distribution This species occurs in the Pacific Ocean off Japan and the Philippines .

Geography The site, notified in 1973, is situated on the north Cornish coast, within Morwenstow civil parish, north of the town of Bude. It starts at Steeple Point in the south, following the shores of the Celtic Sea in the Atlantic Ocean to Marsland Mouth in the north, which is on the Cornwall-Devon border. This site is contiguous with the Bude Coast, Duckpool to Furzey Cove and Marsland to Clovelly Coast (in Devon) chain of SSSIs on this section of coastline.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 190 Bude & Clovelly The South West Coast Path runs through the SSSI and parts of the coastline are owned by the National Trust. The SSSI also covers the Cornish side of Marsland Valley nature reserve, jointly owned by the Devon and Cornwall Wildlife Trusts. Wildlife and ecology The SSSI is sited on a geological formation of Upper Carboniferous Culm Measures, which support a variety of habitats including maritime grassland, woodland, maritime heath, scrub, bodies of water as well as rocky foreshore and cliffs. Flora Amongst the cliff edge grassland buckshorn plantain (Plantago coronopus), carline thistle (Carlina vulgaris), red fescue (Festuca rubra), thrift (Armeria maritima) and wild thyme (Thymus praecox) can be found. Along with some of these species bell heather (Erica cinerea), heather (Calluna vulgaris), burnet rose (Rosa pimpinellifolia), catsear (Hypochaeris), eyebright (of the genus Euphrasia), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and yarrow (Achillea millefolium) grow in the heathlands. Fauna The SSSI supports a wide variety of invertebrates, in particular butterflies and 14 species of dragonfly. Uncommon species of butterfly found include brown hairstreak (Thecla betulae), grayling (Hipparchia semele), grizzled skipper (Pyrgus malvae), high brown fritillary (Argynnis cydippe) and marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia). The coastline of the SSSI supported one of the last known British colonies of breeding large blue butterfly (Maculinea arion), which was declared nationally extinct in 1979. Thereafter, from 1983 the butterfly was reintroduced to the country, including at locations on this site. The coastal habitats support bird-life including the great black-backed gull (Larus marinus) and stonechat (Saxicola torquata), while the common buzzard (Buteo buteo), dipper (Cinclus cinclus), sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and wood warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix) can be found in the woodland areas. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) are also found in the Marsland Valley section of the site.

The Armed Forces Museum is the main museum sorting under the Norwegian Armed Forces Museum superstructure.  The museum's history and focus  The museum was created in 1946 when two former military museums were merged, the Artillery Museum (established in 1860) and the Intendant Museum (created in 1928), under the name Hærmuséet. At first the museum was open only to military personnel, but was opened to the public in 1978 by King Olav V under the name of the Armed Forces Museum. The museum is located inside the Castle Square, in one of the old military arsenals from the 1860s. The main purpose of the museum is to show the Norwegian military history from the Viking Age to the present, and the museum consists of six departments: Directional sign pointing to the museum *The ancient times, military history from the Viking era to 1814. *1814 – 1905, military history from 1814 to 1905. *1905 – 1940, military history from 1905 to 1940. *1940, military history from 1940 to 1945, focusing on the land battles of World War II. *Naval battles, military history from 1940 to 1945, focusing on naval battles of World War II. *After the war, military history from 1945 to present. In addition, there are periods of special exhibitions. In addition to promoting Norwegian military history (especially for school groups), the museum's mission is to be the main military museum.

Appendix to Botanical Register, page 37Tropicos, Pyrolirion Herb. Description Pyrolirion have thin linear leaves that may be pointed at the tips. The flowers, which can vary in coloration, are borne erect on solitary hollow scapes. The perigone is funnel-shaped, with a cylindrical tube that flares out abruptly to star-like radially arranged (actinomorphic) petals. Small scale-like \\"paraperigone\\" may be present at the base. The stamens arise from or below the throat. The style has three branches at the tip with spoon-shaped (spatulate) stigmas. The seeds are laterally compressed, colored black with white seams (raphe). Systematics The genus Pyrolirion was first established by the British botanist William Herbert in 1837. The name Pyrolirion is from Greek πῦρ (pyr, \\"fire\\") and λείριον (leirion, \\"lily\\"). It is named after the flame-like colors of the flowers of Pyrolirion arvense (the golden flame lily). Pyrolirion is classified under the tribe Eustephieae of the subfamily Amaryllidoideae, family Amaryllidaceae. It was previously sometimes considered by some authors as a subgenus of Zephyranthes (rain lilies), but DNA sequencing has shown that it is a distinct genus more closely related to the genera Chlidanthus, Eustephia, and Hieronymiella in the tribe Eustephieae than to members of the tribe Hippeastreae. ;Species The species-level classification of Pyrolirion is unclear and in need of further study.

The church dates from 1075 and lies in the north-west corner of the Medway Towns, historically part of Kent, England. It is a Grade II* listed building, National Heritage List number 1107886. History Early history of Frindsbury The Romans built a stone bridge across the Medway and laid a road on a causeway across the marshy ground below what is now Frindsbury. Evidence of a causewayed road along the bank towards the Frindsbury Peninsula leading to a villa was found in 1819. The present road and field pattern suggest that there was a substantial Roman agricultural settlement centred near Frindsbury. Bishop Eardulf of Rochester obtained Freandisberi and Wicham in 747. Either in confirmation or in addition Offa, King of Mercia, and Sigered, joint King of Kent, granted 20 sulungs of land at Aeslingham in Freodesbrei to the bishop in 764. In 778, King Egbert gave more land to the bishop. In 840, 994, and 998 AD Strood was pillaged by the Danes. The area was wrested from the church and eventually came under the control of Harold Godwinson. After Harold's defeat at the Battle of Hastings, William the Conqueror gave the lands to Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, Earl of Kent, and William's half brother. Archbishop Lanfranc recovered them again at the Trial of Penenden Heath (c. 1072) and restored them to Bishop Gundulf of Rochester. Gundulf was responsible for commencing the rebuilding of Rochester Cathedral and establishing the Benedictine Priory of St Andrew based upon it. He gave the land at Frindsbury to the new priory though insisting they paid an sum to him or his successors on St Andrews day. The Medieval Church Whether there was a Saxon church at Frindsbury is not known for certain, however Wade regards it as \\"highly probable\\". The original Norman church was rebuilt in stone around 1075 by Paulinus, sacrist of Rochester who gave books and vestments to it. The Domesday book records the presence of the church in 1086, but no further details of it. Domesday does however record that the bishop was entitled to 10 shillings (50p) from the manor of Frindsbury. The church was rebuilt in 1127. The term \\"rebuilding\\" may refer to a large repair rather than a complete reconstruction. Dugdale says that John (Bishop of Rochester 1125-1137) \\"built the church of Frindsbury ... of stone, from the treasury of Rochester church\\". cited in A small wooden church was erected at Strood in 1122 as a chapel of ease to the parish church. It became St Nicholas', the parish church of Strood in 1193 and is situated where the Watling Street left the firm ground to run over the marshes to the Medway bridge. Bishop Gilbert de Glanvill claimed Frinsdsbury back from the monks \\"as belonging to the maintenance of his table\\" in 1185. According to Hasted the bishop succeeded in obtaining the church, but the manor remained in the possession of the monks until the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII in 1523. Barnard however records that in 1256, the church of Frindsbury (and thus the income) was returned to the Bishop. There was a chapel dedicated to St Peter (1142) within the Manor of Islingham. Services were held 1330 to 1542 when they were discontinued. The building became an oast house. In 1279 and again in 1293, 1314 and 1357 the bishop of Rochester claimed liberties in the lands of the priory of Frindsbury as well as all lands belonging to the church. There was more building in the 14th century and around 1407. Modern During the English Reformation, decorations were removed or painted over. Wall paintings of St Lawrence, St Edmund of Canterbury, and St William of Perth were discovered in 1883. The church was extensively restored in 1884, with a large donation from a Mrs Murray, wife to Rev. George Edward Murray, son of a former bishop of Rochester. Upnor (St Philip and St James) became an independent parish in 1884, but was reabsorbed in 1955. Architecture Frindsbury Church from Rochester Castle As a result of quarrying, the church now stands isolated above chalk cliffs, visible from much of the Medway valley. It is surrounded by graveyards. The West Churchyard is managed by Medway Council and the East Churchyard by the PCC. Exterior The church is a composite building of flint and ragstone rubble with ragstone and Caen Stone dressings. Generally the earlier work is flint/ragstone and the later rubble/limestone. The plan is traditional with a rectangular chancel, arch, nave with aisles north and south and west end tower. The chancel, nave and lower parts of the tower are Norman. In the 14th century the tower stair and south aisle were added. The north aisle was added (or possibly rebuilt) in 1884. The tower is topped by a shingle spire set within the battlements. Fine views are afforded all round, but access is through the bell chamber which is difficult and not open to the public. There are three stages, the lowest being a west end porch, above that the present ringing chamber and above that the bell chamber. The south aisle extends from the chancel arch back towards the west end, but stops one bay short. It is roofed in metal with a plain parapet. It has the south door, now available for wheelchair access. The vestry lies to the northeast alongside the chancel. It runs into the north aisle which extends to the west end. Again the roof is of metal. The nave and chancel roofs are pitched and tiled, the latter with traditional Kent tiles. =Tombs= A number of tombs in the graveyard are listed buildings in their own right. The Boghurst tomb is a chest tomb of 1750 close to the south door. The listing draws attention to its inscriptions, the urn balusters and notes that it is railed. The Moulding tomb is another chest tomb, this time of 1789. It lies to the east of the church, adjacent to the old (not current) eastern boundary. The inscriptions and urn balusters are noted in the official description. The Miller monument is a good example of a later (early 19 century) sarcophagus monument notable for the \\"running dog\\" frieze. The antiquarian and co-founder of the British Archaeological Association, Charles Roach Smith (1807 – 1890) is buried in the churchyard. There are a group of 12 headstones listed as a single entry in the official listing. They are all 17th and 18th century, south of the south aisle of the church. Interior All_Saints, the parish church of Frindsbury – geograph.org.uk – 1232042 The main entrance to the church is through the west end door. The base of the tower has been refurbished with cupboards made from pews removed from the rear of the church. To the right is a small door leading up the tower to the belfry. Many of the tombstones on the floor were translated there from the south aisle or the north wall after 19th-century rebuilding. The tower arch leading to the nave is filled with a glazed oak screen inscribed with the names of the war dead (World War I one side, World War II the other) of the parish. The nave has been virtually obliterated by the successive building of the arcades to the aisles. Only the westernmost bay of the south wall remains, heavily rebuilt in the 15th century with a modern window. The floor has been tiled and is devoid of monuments. There is now no trace of a rood loft but Henry Larkin's will of 1471 left goods to pay for its maintenance. Against the tower wall the Dutch Sanctus bell used to hang (see Bells, below). A modern WC and kitchenette has been installed at the west end of the nave. The south aisle is separated from the nave by a three bay arcade. The arches are plainly moulded resting upon octagonal piers. The east window is modern, those in the side wall restored in the 15th century. A small piscina in the south wall gives evidence of the site of the Lady chapel. The floor has been raised and tiled so little other trace remains. A 1533 will refers to this: \\"To be buried in our Lady Chaunsell in the Church of Frennesbury. I give to the said church a cross to stand uppon the herse at buryings and obetts, and at other times uppon our lady aulter\\". At the west end of the south aisle, adjacent to the south door is the early 15th-century font. It is octagonal on a stone column with a modern wooden cover. There is a notable wall monument of 1621 to Thomas Buttler (see below) immediately behind it. The north aisle was built in 1883. The organ stood at the east end from 1987 until it was ruined, see below. The chancel is approached through a wide Norman arch. The squints on either side are modern. Thurlby notes that the detailing of parts of the arch date it to around 1130. The chancel roof is in part original (notably the cross beams) but with much of the timberwork renewed. Traces have been found of the original windows in the side walls with surrounding frescos, but they were blocked in when the present Perpendicular windows were inserted. The rose window in the east wall is a reconstruction of the original when the wall was rebuilt. Below are three Norman windows which for many years had been covered by a reredos. When uncovered they here surrounded with medieval frescos, alas now fading. In the south wall there are the remains of a priest's door and a piscina. =The Buttler memorial= There are two panels, the left hand one reads: HERE DOTH THOMAS BVTTLER REMAINE THAT SARVED QVEENE ELYZABETHE ALL HER RAINE IN INGLAND, FRANCE AND SPANE IN IRLAND, SCOTLAND WITH THE BEST AND HEARE IN GRAVE, HIS CORPS DOOTH RESTE: A.D. 1621; The right hand one records his two wives, both of whom predeceased him: DENNIS, THE WIFE OF THOMAS BVTTLER, WAS BVRIED, THE SECOND DAY OF JANVARY, ANO.DOM. 1607 MARGARET, THE WIFE OF THOMAS BVTTLER, WAS BVRED, THE THIRD OF FEBRVARYE ANO.DOM. 1617 =Frescos= The frescos uncovered in 1883 had practically disappeared by 1990. The remains of one have been preserved, the others have been painted over. Before the frescos were covered over, a small copy of them was made which hangs on the south wall of the chancel. The window in the north wall has St. Leonard in the left jamb and St. Edmund of Pontigny in the right. St Edmund was Archbishop of Canterbury 1234–40, this is the only known mural of him. There were altars to St. Edmund in the crypts of Rochester and Canterbury. The window in the south wall has on the left a capped and nimbed (haloed) female, otherwise unidentified, that to the right an unnimbed bishop. Both were very faded at the time of their discovery. The east wall lights are in part missing. Of the northern one only half remains with St. Laurence in the jamb. The central light is entirely missing and that to the south is two-fifths lost. The left hand jamb has a nimbed woman with pink underdress and slate blue robe. Hope supposes this to be St. Mary Magdalene. The right hand jamb has an unnimbed pilgrim. Hope believes the figures date from 1256 when Bishop de St. Laurence Martin obtained a grant of land for Frindsbury from Rochester priory and the same year in which St. William of Perth was canonised. The right hand figure may well therefore be St. William, in which case it is also the only known mural of him. Music Organ The earliest photographic evidence of an organ shows it situated in a loft above the main entrance. A new organ was built in 1889 by Forster and Andrews and placed behind the choir stalls on the north of the chancel. In 1987 the organ was moved into the north aisle and extended. It was ruined in 2008 by rain water following the theft of metal from the roof. It was subsequently sold to a private collector. Music is provided now by an electric organ and by an enthusiastic group drawn from the younger members of the church. Bells The ringing chamber is reached by the 15th-century spiral staircase from the ground floor of the tower. The room contains the church clock, installed in 1911 as a memorial to the family of John Rose. The ringing chamber was probably the medieval priests' lodgings, and as such has the typical window giving a view of the chancel. A wooden ladder leads up to the bell chamber. There is a ring of eight bells (tenor in F) hung in the English style for full circle ringing. The earliest recorded date is on the number 6 bell which was originally cast in 1260. In 1584 what is now the number 7 was cast. The current service bell was cast in 1637 as the treble of five. The following year the tenor was cast by John Wilnar. In 1656 the then second (now 5th) was recast by John Darbie. This was the ring \\"of five bells and a small one\\" recorded by Hasted in 1797. In 1865 the tenor was recast. In 1670 a Dutch founder, Gerritt Schimmel, cast what became for a while the sanctus bell. It hung on the west wall of the nave until the 1980s. Love records it as having been sold, Wade claims it was stolen in 1982. In 1920 the old second and third (now 5 and 6) were recast by Alfred Bowell and three new trebles supplied to augment the ring to the present eight. In 1923 Bowell recast the back two bells. In 2000 the only remaining pre 20th-century bell, the 1637 number four was found to be of poor tone. As part of a refurbishment sponsored by the Millennium Commission it was hung dead as the service bell and a new fourth (\\"Carole\\") was cast by John Taylor & Co.

It was a popular trade center, especially for precious commodities. Overview Yarumela also called Hiarumela, llarumela, or \\"El Chilcal\\", was an Lenca settlement from the Middle Formative period in Mesoamerica, a period that ran from approximately: 900 BC-300BC. The Lenca are an indigenous mesoamerican people from southwestern Honduras and eastern El Salvador. Yarumela was part of a region the covered around 16,000 square kilometres and shared the region with other archaeological sites such as: La Venta, Los Naranjos, Lo de Vaca and Playa de los Muertos. Features of Yarumela left Located sixty kilometres south of the Los Naranjos, the site of Yarumela yielded information that led archaeologists to believe that it was another imposing Middle Formative center. This information also led archaeologists to believe that Yarumela as a center had a focus on precious commodities. Much like the settlement found at Los Naranjos, Yarumela’s area was protected by the location in which it was found. On the Eastern side the settlement at Yarumela was protected by the Humuya River, which was a branch off of the Ulua, and on the western side it was protected by a large man-made ditch. The settlement at Yarumela was considered to be a large and prosperous trade center; archaeologists determined this from the numerous large structure mounds they found on the site as well as some of the material artifacts located there as well. Artifacts like shells, jadeite, obsidian fragments as well as exotic ceramics. Trade Route through Yarumela The settlement of Yarumela covered approximately 74 acres (30 hectares) of territory in the Comayagua Valley and because of its location the site exploited a major passageway between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Seas. This was evidenced by the large among of ornamental shells found at the site, shells that were native to both coastal regions, this paired with the amount of Guatemalan jade and other exotic items found by archaeologists at the site location leads researches to believe that it was indeed a central trade route for the region. El Cerrito The site at Yarumela yielded many large structural mounds, including the largest one which reached a height of approximately 19 metres or sixty two feet high, Structure 101, named “El Cerrito”. This was determined to be the ‘main mound’ and was located in the central district of the site. Archaeologists determined that when it was fully functional and maintained the structure was visible from almost any point in the valley where the site was situated. El Cerrito is the main focus/attraction of the site at Yarumela, along with another visible large mound and a reconstructed small step pyramid close to the river opposite the large mounds. Rehabilitation of the archaeological site On April 11, 2019, the mayor of the town of Yarumela and the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History with the support of the national police of Honduras, restored structure 102 and managed to rehabilitate a good part of the site, installing signs where there is information about the history of the place. It is currently open to both national and foreign public. References Evans, Susan Toby. 2008 Ancient Mexico & Central America Thames & Hudson Ltd.

Formation During the conventional formation process of cross- stratification, sand grains saltate up the upstream side of the dune, collecting at the peak until the angle of repose is reached. At this point, the crest of granular material has grown too large and will be overcome by the force of the depositing fluid, falling down the downstream side of the dune. Repeated avalanches will eventually form the sedimentary structure known as cross-stratification, with the structure dipping in the direction of the paleocurrent. In tidal areas, which have bidirectional flow, structures are formed with alternating layers of cross-beds dipping in opposite directions that reflect the alternating paleocurrent. These sedimentary structures are not common because they require the current to be equal in both directions, which rarely happens in nature. The time period represented by each cross- stratified layer is likely to be many years. The pattern of the structure is said to resemble the backbone structure of a herring fish.

The US state of Montana has taken legislative steps towards reducing the possible effects of climate change. Impacts Water resources According to the IPCC, possible effects on water systems for the Montana region include less water available in some areas. Warming in mountain states is projected by the IPCC to cause decreased snowpack, more winter flooding, and reduced summer flows. This may increase competition for water resources. Montana is a headwater state, and consequently, potential climate change effects that impact Montana's water resources reach far beyond the state borders. The Department of Environmental Quality, Montana, has determined that climate change will affect essential water resources in Montana as water quality and ecosystems may be compromised when contaminants and sediment are carried by spring run-off at unnatural times.Montana Department of Environmental Quality, Climate Change. A report from the University of Lethbridge found climate change may alter stream flow and water supply volume by lowering snowpack which may cause low reservoir storage in the spring and dangerously low flows in the summer making perennial streams potentially intermittent.Larson, Robert P., Bryne, James M., Johnson, Daniel L., Letts, Matthew G, Kienzie, Stefan W. \\"Modelling Climate Change Impacts on Spring Runoff for the Rocky Mountains of Montana and Alberta I: Model Development, Calibration and Historical Analysis.\\" University of Lethbridge, Alberta. (2010). people.uleth.ca/~matthew.letts/Larson%20et%20al%202011a.pdf. The Montana Wildlife Conservation Society is concerned that warming water may also change patterns of some species such as native bull trout require colder water than other fish and would have a difficult time surviving if waters warmed.Wildlife Conservation Society. \\"Mapping Montana for Climate Change.\\" (2011). http://www.wcs.org/news-and-features-main/a-roadless-map-for-climate- change.aspx. Forest resources Montana's forests sequester up to 23.1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents annually—approximately 62 percent of the state's gross emissions. The state also contains 8.9 million acres thought suitable for afforestation with a potential sequestration capacity of up to 15 million metric tons.Montana Climate Change Advisory Committee. \\"Montana Climate Change Action Plan\\". 2007, Section 2, pp. 2, 5; Appendix I, p. 43. The impacts of climate change upon Montana's forests could result in feedback: assuming a shift to a 'drier' precipitation and temperature scenario, the sequestration capacity of Montana's high-elevation forests could be reduced or even eliminated entirely.Boisenvue, Celine and Running, Steven. \\"Simulations Show Decreasing Carbon Stocks and Potential for Carbon Emissions in Rocky Mountain Forests Over the Next Century\\". Ecological Applications, 2010, pp. 1302-1319. Agriculture The effect of climate change on agriculture varies among regions and Montana's agricultural production may not change substantially as global temperatures continue to increase over the short term according to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. Major challenges are projected for crops that are near the warm end of their suitable range or depend on highly utilized water resources . Human health Adverse health impacts from climate change have already been documented, and are expected to increase during the twenty-first century. Montanans will experience health impacts from increased temperatures and decreased stream flows that are similar to those in other parts of the country.Harvard Medical School Center for Health and the Global Environment, Climate Change and Health in Montana (Nov. 2009) Decreased summer stream flows will lead to heavier concentrations of pollutants including toxic metals, microbes and nutrients. Higher temperatures and increased forest fires will adversely affect air quality, increasing incidences of asthma, lung and heart disease. On average, climate change has already extended the allergy season by 20 days annually since 1950. State adaptation and mitigation Renewables In April, 2005, Montana established a renewable energy portfolio which requires all public utilities to derive at least 15% of their electricity from renewable energy resources by 2015. Part of Montana's renewable energy development plan is to stimulate rural economic development by requiring public utilities to buy renewable energy credits and electricity generated by community-based energy utility companies. From 2010-2014, public utility companies in Montana must purchase 50 MW from these rural community- based utility companies. Beginning in 2015, that figure will grow to 75 MW. Any utility company serving more than 5,000 people is required to create a renewable energy standard which promotes renewable energy development, with specific emphasis on rural economic development. Currently, Montana's renewable energy is derived primarily from wind energy, geothermal energy and solar energy. Montana offers many tax incentives and loan programs for individuals and businesses to promote renewable energy development at all levels in both the private and the public sector. This renewable-energy promoting legislation includes production incentives, utility grants and loans, a green power program, property tax exemptions, and production tax reductions. In 2009, Montana received $10.3 million in federal Recovery Act funding to improve the energy efficiency of state buildings and expand renewable energy use and recycling infrastructure in the state. The funds will also be used for grants to encourage use of new clean energy technologies that have moved into the production phase but are not yet well known or utilized in the state. Montana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) will also extend low-interest loans to consumers, businesses, and nonprofit organizations to install various renewable energy systems, including wind, solar, geothermal, hydro and biomass. Wind Montana is ranked among the top five states in the nation for wind power generation potential. As of 2009, Montana produced 820,924 MWh of wind-generated electricity, which represented more than three percent of all electricity generated in Montana that year. Montana is ranked first in the nation for wind speed of class 3 and above, with the majority of wind sites located in areas of low population, near communities that favor wind energy development. Montana Department of Environmental Quality maintains monitoring data from current wind-powered facilities and provides that data to people who are interested in wind energy investment opportunities in the state. The Energy Promotion and Development Division \\"facilitates a wind and transmission working group that consists of industry, government, academic and other stakeholders. The group has been meeting quarterly since April 2008 and it convenes to identify obstacles to transmission and wind development and to develop strategies to overcome those obstacles.\\" Large-scale wind farms in Montana currently include Glacier wind farm near Shelby, Judith Gap wind farm in Wheatland County, Diamond Willow wind farm near Baker, MT, and Horseshoe Bend Wind Park near Great Falls. Detailed wind power maps are available on MDEQ's official site. Geothermal In May, 2005, the State of Montana, Department of Energy (DOE) and Sage Resources of Missoula, Montana established the Montana Geothermal Program. Montana's potential for large-scale geothermal energy development is still being evaluated. DOE's Geopowering the West program indicates that Montana has more than 25,000 square miles of high- potential sites and areas. Currently, Montana has 15 high-temperature sites located near White Sulphur Springs, Helena, Ennis, Bozeman, Butte and Boulder, and more than 50 designated geothermal areas of varying temperatures across the entire state. A total of twenty-seven known sites have surface temperatures ranging from 110 °F to above 149 °F, and current temperature estimates for deep reservoirs exceed 350 °F. An interactive topographic map providing details about Montana's principal geothermal sites is available on MDEQ's official site. Solar Currently, most of Montana's solar energy projects are undertaken at the residential or small-scale municipal level in homes, ranches, schools, community buildings and business. The feasibility of larger- scale solar energy generation facilities in Montana continues to be researched. Eastern Montana receives an annual average of 5 hours of full sun, and western Montana receives an annual average of 4.2 hours, so Montana has adequate solar resources to support more widespread development of solar energy in the future. The State of Montana currently offers numerous tax incentives and revolving loan programs to encourage solar energy development projects. Details of those programs can also be found on MDEQ's official site. Local government In 2007, Montana published its comprehensive Climate Change Action Plan and became the seventh U.S. state to join the Western Climate Initiative (WCI). Shortly thereafter, numerous local governments across the state began to develop formal climate change policies and greenhouse gas emission standards to be implemented at the local level. The standards published in the local climate change action plans are largely patterned after Montana's comprehensive Climate Change Action Plan. In 2009, Helena issued its community climate action plan.http://www.ci.helena.mt.us/fileadmin/user_upload/City_Public_Works/Global_Climate/Documents/2009/Climate_Task_Force_Report_8-19-09.pdf In 2011, Bozeman released its final climate action plan and so did Missoula County.http://www.geosinstitute.org/images/stories/pdfs/MissoulaFINALreport.pdf Additionally, Montana State University and University of Montana also issued climate change action plans for the campus communities.Montana State University Climate Change Action Plan University of Montana Climate Change Action Plan In late 2011, Missoula County's Clark Fork Coalition began the process of developing climate action strategies as well.Clark Fork Coalition Climate Change Action Plan In 2018, the City of Red Lodge adopted an Energy Conservation Plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 50% of 2016 levels by 2040. City of Red Lodge Energy Conservation Plan Otter Creek =Background= In the mid 1990s the federal government purchased a large tract of property neighboring Yellowstone National Park in order to prevent a proposed gold mine from being developed on the land. As a result of the land transaction, Montana stood to lose substantial revenue from mining royalties and requested that the state be compensated for the loss. After a period of negotiation the federal government agreed to transfer its ownership in the Otter Creek coal tracts to the state. The Tracts were located in south eastern Montana, in an area rich with coal but largely undeveloped. At the time of the sale, the Tracts were surrounded by a checkerboard pattern of private property owned by a large real estate company; Great Northern Properties. Several years after Montana took ownership of the Tracts, Great Northern Properties sold its interest in the surrounding properties to Arch Coal, Inc., the second largest coal developed in the United States. In 2009, the Montana State Land Board, the body responsible for deciding how Montana's state lands will be managed, voted to seek bids from development companies interested in the Otter Creek Tracts. After the initial bidding period ended with no bids received, the Land Board lowered the price per ton and resubmitted the Tracts for bidding. Arch Coal was the only bidder for the Otter Creek Tracts In March 2010, the Land Board voted 3-2 to accept Arch Coal's bid for the Tracts. =Litigation= In reaching its decision to lease the Tracts, the Land Board was not required, under state statute, to consider any environmental impacts or consequences that would result from the proposed mine. After the Land Board approved the leases, Northern Plains Resource Council and other conservation groups filed suit in the Sixteenth Judicial District in Broadus, Montana.http://leg.mt.gov/content/Services%20Division/Lepo/mepa/Court- Cases/NPRCvsBLC.pdf The groups argued in court documents that the Land Board did not consider the impacts on climate change that the new mine would have and that the Land Board did not consider a single alternative to the full development of the mine, as required by the Montana Environmental Policy Act. Montana moved the court to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that lacked legal standing to challenge the Land Board's decision, that the Montana Environmental Policy Act did not apply to decisions of the Land Board, and that the statute allowing the Land Board to not consider any environmental impacts was constitutional. After hearing argument on the issues, the court denied Montana's dismissal of the suit and allowed the case to proceed on the merits. As of November 2011, the case is still being litigated in the Sixteenth Judicial District. Other pending lawsuits =Climate change trust litigation= In May, 2011, several parents filed suit on behalf of their minor children in the Montana Supreme Court.http://supremecourtdocket.mt.gov/view/OP%2011-0258%20Writ%20-%20Other%20--%20Petition?id={80553430-6861-4124-B4AE- AC8877E1449A} The parents argued that the atmosphere was a public resource held in trust by Montana for the benefit Montana citizens, and that the state had an affirmatively duty to protect that resource from harms like climate change. The petition to the Montana Supreme Court listed many climate change related impacts that were occurring within the state and argued that \\"public trust\\" was impacted by these changes. Initially, the state did not respond to the lawsuit filed by the parents. The Montana Supreme Court however, ordered the state Attorney General’s office to respond to the petition. When the state Attorney General’s office did respond, they did not attack the merits of the parents’ argument but rather challenged the procedural posture of the case. The parents had filed their case under the \\"original jurisdiction\\" of the Montana Supreme Court, rather than an appeal. The original jurisdiction of the Montana Supreme Court was limited by the Montana Constitution. The Attorney General's office argued that the parents had failed to establish that the case fell within the bounds of the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction and argued that the high Court deny the petition in favor of the normal, lower court process. The Supreme Court agreed with the Attorney General's office and dismissed the petition for original jurisdiction. The Court stated that the complexity of the case and the amount of factual determinations that had to be made were better suited for a fact-finding lower court, rather than the state's high court.

It is also known as the Ford Bungalow. The house was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1979 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History Hebard–Ford Summer House, c. 1910s In 1878, lumber baron Charles Hebard founded the logging town of Pequaming nine miles north of L'Anse on the shore of Lake Superior. It was the first large-scale lumbering operation in the Upper Peninsula. Hebard built and owned all the buildings in the town, including approximately 100 houses built for workers. The population of Pequaming peaked at around 800 in 1897. Charles Hebard died in 1904, passing his lumber business and the town of Pequaming to his sons, Daniel and Charles. In 1914, Daniel Hebard built this lodge as his periodic residence. In 1923, the brothers sold the operation to Henry Ford; although Ford was primarily interested in the Hebard's 40,000 acres of timber, the brothers insisted he buy the sawmill and the town at the same time. Ford used the town to produce wooden pieces for the frames and bodies of Ford stationwagons. Henry Ford took over Daniel Hebard's lodge for his own personal use, and summered here from 1923 to 1941. However, Ford's need for lumber dropped during the Great Depression, and shipping problems during World War II spelled the end for Pequaming's mill. Ford shut the plant down in 1942; with the loss of jobs, most families soon left the town. The Hebard–Ford house is currently privately owned, but available as a vacation rental. Description The Hebard–Ford house is a rectangular, two-story lodge built in the Bungaloid style. It is of frame construction, covered with white clapboards, with a low gable roof with long shed dormers. A veranda is contained under the roofline, which is supported with seven cement pillars. The main floor has double hung, six-over-six paned windows with dark trim, and two sets of French doors open onto the veranda. Inside are eight bedrooms, seven bathrooms, a large living room, a dining room, and an office. Outside was a caretaker's residence, a formal garden and a tennis court. The house reflects a gracious style of living that rich industrialists valued in northern Michigan vacation lodges.

The species is one of twelve in the gastropod genus Babella. Description The milk-white shell has an elongate-conic, turreted shape. Its length measures 4.4 mm. The three whorls of the protoconch are small, helicoid, rather loosely coiled and elevated. They have their axis at a right angle to the axis of the later whorls and about one-third immersed in the first of them. The nine whorls of the teleoconch are flattened, strongly sculptured, with axial ribs and three spiral keels. There is a strong, rounded, rather broad spiral keel on each side of the deeply sulcate periphery. The peripheral sulcus is about as wide as a keel and marks the path for the shouldered and crenulated summit of the succeeding whorls. A second deep spiral sulcus, equal in width to the peripheral one, is situated just posterior to the posterior keel, and this marks the anterior termination of the strong, rounded, backward-slanting axial ribs between the sutures. Sixteen of these ribs occur upon the second, seventeen upon the fifth, and twenty upon the penultimate whorl. The intercostal spaces almost as wide as the ribs, crossed by two strongly impressed, moderately broad spiral lines, which also pass over and somewhat constrict the axial ribs, giving them a dumbbell-shaped outline. The posterior thickened portion is a little wider than the anterior one. The space between these two deeply impressed lines is crossed by about eight minute, subequally spaced spiral striations. The periphery of the body whorl is deeply sulcate, crossed by numerous closely spaced axial striations. The keel anterior to the periphery is almost as strong as the one posterior to it. The third keel is a little anterior to the middle of the base and is rather low and broad. The space between it and the keel above is gently rounded and finely axially striated, which is also true of the space between this keel and the umbilical area. The aperture is moderately large, suboval, effuse at the junction of the outer lip and the columella. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is thin, irregular in outline, showing the external sculpture within. The columella is short, curved, stout, bearing a strong, acute, oblique fold a little anterior to its insertion. The parietal wall is covered by a thin callus. Distribution This species has only ever occurred within the Pacific Ocean off the east coast of Japan.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=588554 on 2011-11-29 Description The elongate-conic shell tapers to an extremely slender apex. The polished shell is white, with a slight suffusion of brown at the apex and near the aperture. Its length measures 17.3 mm. The two whorls of the protoconch are large, compared with the early whorls of the teleoconch, helicoid, depressed, smooth, having their axis almost at a right angle to the axis of the later whorls and extending beyond the outline of these on the left side. The first three whorls of the teleoconch are well rounded, the next five considerably flattened, the seven others decidedly obese. The first five are vitreous, but as the shell grows older it gradually becomes milk-white. The summits of the whorls are closely appressed to the preceding whorl, the appressed portion appearing as a narrow band, which at first sight appears as the suture. This, however, is very inconspicuous. All the whorls of the teleoconch are marked by fine lines of growth and fine, closely placed, wavy spiral striations. The periphery and the base of the body whorl are well rounded. They are marked by lines of growth and spiral striations as between the sutures. The area immediately adjoining the columella is decidedly depressed, forming a pit, but the axis is not perforate. The aperture is auriform, moderately large, and oblique. The posterior angle is acute, slightly channeled at the junction of the outer lip and columella. The columella is rather strong, very oblique, revolute showing only the lamellar posterior fold when the lip is complete. This fold is situated a little anterior to the insertion of the columella. The parietal wall is covered by a decided callus. Specimens having the outer lip fractured show the well- developed, very oblique anterior fold, also seven spiral lirations all of which but the anterior one, which is stronger, are subequal and subequally spaced.W.H.

(2009), Systematic Classification of Recent and Fossil Conoidean Gastropods, ConchBooks, Hankenheim, Germany, 295 pp. * Genus Conus sensu stricto Linnaeus, 1758 :: Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The basic shell shape is conical to elongated conical, has a deep anal notch on the shoulder, a smooth periostracum and a small operculum. The shoulder of the shell is usually nodulose and the protoconch is usually multispiral. Markings often include the presence of tents except for black or white color variants, with the absence of spiral lines of minute tents and textile bars. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radula has an elongated anterior section with serrations and a large exposed terminating cusp, a non-obvious waist, blade is either small or absent and has a short barb, and lacks a basal spur. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the Indo-Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species eat other gastropods including cones. * Subgenus Calibanus da Motta, 1991 ::Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The protoconch is paucispiral, and the shell is turbinate in shape. The anal notch is moderate to deep. The anterior end of the shell is darkened, and may be brown or purple. Tent markings on the shell are poorly developed or may be absent, spiral lines of minute tents are absent, and textile bars are absent. The periostracum is smooth, and the operculum is small. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The anterior section of the radula is much longer than posterior section, and the waist is not obvious. A basal spur is absent, the barb and blade are short. Serrations and a terminating cusp on the radular tooth are present. ::Geographical distribution :::The one species in this genus occurs in the Indo-Pacific region.. ::Feeding habits :::The one species in this genus is molluscivorous (meaning that it preys upon molluscs). It is reported to prey on other cone species, most frequently Phasmoconus radiatus (Gmelin, 1791).Espino, S.S., Kohn, J.J., Villanueva, J.A., Heralde, F.M., III, Cornweli, P.S., Concepcion, G.P., Olivera, B.M., & Santox, A.D.

It measures 6.7 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are small, obliquely almost completely immersed in the first of the succeeding whorls, only the periphery of the last two being visible. The nine whorls of the teleoconch are rather high between the sutures, very slightly rounded, slightly angulated at the periphery and scarcely at all shouldered. They are marked by scarcely perceptible lines of growth, and here and there by a faint trace of some very fine microscopic spiral lines. The summit of succeeding whorls falls somewhat anterior to the periphery of the preceding turns, which gives a slightly constricted appearance at the well-impressed suture. The periphery of the body whorl is faintly angulated. The base of the shell is large, well rounded, narrowly umbilicated and somewhat effuse at the junction of the lip and columella. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin. The long columella is slender, almost straight, somewhat revolute, bearing a strong oblique fold near its insertion. The parietal wall is covered by a thin callus. Distribution This species occurs in the Pacific Ocean off Japan.

The whorls of the protoconch are deeply obliquely immersed in the first whorl of the teleoconch above which only the tilted edge of the last volution projects. The four whorls of the teleoconch are moderately rounded, strongly contracted at the sutures, and moderately shouldered at the summit. They are marked by the moderately strong, tuberculate, slightly retractive axial ribs, of which 16 occur upon the second and 18 upon the third and penultimate turn. In addition to the axial ribs the whorls are marked by four spiral cords between the sutures which are a little less strong than the axial ribs and render them nodulous at their junction. The spaces enclosed by the ribs and spiral cords are deep round pits. The sutures are channeled. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by a groove. The base of the shell is well rounded. It is marked by six strong, spiral cords which decrease successively in size and spacing from the periphery to the umbilicus. The grooves between the spiral cords are marked by slender threads corresponding to the axial ribs. The aperture is irregularly pyriform. The posterior angle is acute. The thin outer lip is pinched in posteriorly, and shows the external sculpture within. The columella is slender, slightly reflected, and provided with a fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is covered with a thin callus.

It is the largest manufacturer of cables in the world measured by revenues. Prysmian Group is a public company, listed on the Borsa Italiana in the FTSE MIB index. History Prysmian Srl was created by Goldman Sachs from the cables and systems division of Pirelli & C. S.p.A.. Goldman Sachs signed an agreement on 1 June 2005 to purchase the two companies who made up the division: Pirelli Cavi e Sistemi Energia S.p.A. and Pirelli Cavi e Sistemi Telecom S.p.A. The transaction was completed on 28 July 2005, after regulatory approval by the relevant antitrust authorities. Draka Draka was founded in 1910 by Jan Teewis Duyvis as Hollandsche Draad & Kabel Fabriek. In 1970, Draka was acquired by Philips and became part of the Philips' Wire and Cable division.Nederlands Kabel Fabrieken Through a buyout financed by Parcom and Flint Beheer, Draka became independent in 1986 at which point the name Draka was born. It formerly had a joint venture with Alcatel- Lucent for manufacturing optical fibre, but bought out its partner's 49.9% stake for €209 million in December 2007. Prysmian Group Prysmian Group was created in 2011 through the merger of Prysmian and Draka. In 2009, Italian cable manufacturer Prysmian made a takeover offer for Draka, but doubts began to emerge in August. Prysmian called off the takeover talks in early September. In October 2010, French cable maker Nexans made a €15/share offer to buy the 43.9% of the company held by Flint Beheer, an investment fund owned by the wealthy Fentener van Vlissingen family. Nexans indicated that it would sell off Draka's telecommunications activities. However, Draka rejected Nexans' offer, and on 22 November 2010 instead accepted Prysmian's new offer of €17.20/share (9.1x EBITDA). Prysmian intended to integrate Draka's operations into their own, rather than breaking it up; integration costs are estimated at €170 million over three years. The merger of Prysmian and Draka, and the integration of the two market-leading companies, culminated in the creation of the world's largest cable maker by revenue, the Prysmian Group. In December 2017, Prysmian acquired General Cable Corporation of Highland Heights, Kentucky in a $3 billion deal which was finalized on 6 June 2018.

These are 2, well rounded. They form a planorboid spire, the axis of which is almost at right angles to that of the succeeding turns, in the first of which the nuclear spire is about half obliquely immersed.The seven whorls of the teleoconch are flattened, and narrowly, tabulatedly shouldered at the summit. They are marked by strong, well-rounded, retractive axial ribs, of which 18 occur upon the first and 16 upon the remaining whorls, except the last, which has 20. These ribs pass prominently from the shoulder to the peripheral sulcus. In addition to the axial sculpture, the first 4 turns are crossed by 4 equal and equally spaced, flattened spiral cords, which are about as wide as the spaces that separate them. On the rest of the turns the subperipheral cord comes into the suture and on the penultimate whorl forms a well-developed 5-spiral cord on the spire. The spaces enclosed by the axial ribs and spiral cords are deeply impressed oblong pits, while the junction of the ribs and spiral cords form well-rounded tubercles. The suture of the early turns, where the fifth spiral is still below the summit of the succeeding turn, is deeply channeled, less so on the later whorls. The periphery of the body whorl is strongly rounded. The base of the shell is short, inflated, and strongly rounded. It is marked by nine strong, rounded, spiral cords which are almost equal and as wide as the spaces that separate them. The grooves between these spiral cords are crossed by numerous slender axial riblets. The aperture is oval. The posterior angle is obtuse. The thin outer lip is rendered sinuous by the external sculpture. The inner lip is slender, thin, and somewhat revolute. It is provided with a strong oblique fold at its insertion.

Montpelier is an inner suburban area of Brighton, part of the English city and seaside resort of Brighton and Hove. Developed together with the adjacent Clifton Hill area in the mid-19th century, it forms a high-class, architecturally cohesive residential district with \\"an exceptionally complete character\\". Stucco-clad terraced housing and villas predominate, but two of the city's most significant Victorian churches and a landmark hospital building are also in the area, which lies immediately northwest of Brighton city centre and spreads as far as the ancient parish boundary with Hove. Development was initially stimulated when one of the main roads out of Brighton was turnpiked in the late 18th century, but the hilly land—condemned as \\"hideous masses of unfledged earth\\" by John Constable, who painted it nevertheless—was mostly devoted to agriculture until the 1820s. The ascent of Brighton from provincial fishing town to fashionable resort prompted a building boom in the next quarter-century, and Montpelier and Clifton Hill were transformed into districts of architecturally homogeneous streets with carefully designed, intricately detailed housing. Little demolition, infilling or redevelopment has occurred since, and hundreds of buildings have been granted listed status. The whole suburb is also one of 34 conservation areas in the city of Brighton and Hove. Historic buildings include The Temple—local landowner Thomas Read Kemp's house, now a private school—the former Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, currently being redeveloped, and large mid 19th-century houses such as Montpelier Hall. The area also has several set- piece residential squares and crescents such as Clifton Terrace, Powis Square, Vernon Terrace, Montpelier Crescent and Montpelier Villas. The architectural partnership of Amon Wilds, his son Amon Henry Wilds and Charles Busby—the most important architects in Regency era Brighton and Hove—designed many of these. Montpelier's range of churches includes some of the city's finest, but others have been demolished in the postwar period. Location and character Montpelier covers the area between Seven Dials, Dyke Road, Western Road and the boundary with Hove (east of York Avenue). St Nicholas Church is at the bottom right; St Ann's Well Gardens are top left. Montpelier is a centrally located inner suburb of the city of Brighton and Hove. The Lanes, the ancient centre of Brighton, is about to the southeast, and central Hove is about to the west. London is to the north. There is no single official definition of the area covered by Montpelier and Clifton Hill, but most authorities (including Brighton and Hove City Council) define it as the area west of West Hill and east of the ancient parish boundary between Brighton and Hove. The Seven Dials area and the road junction of that name are to the north, forming the apex of the roughly triangular area, and the major city-centre shopping street Western Road lies to the south. Two roads form important through routes for cross-city traffic: Montpelier Road runs south–north from the city centre to Seven Dials, and the west–east Upper North Street links the city centre to Hove. Both are busy, but traffic is limited in the smaller residential streets. St Mary Magdalen's Church and the English Channel are visible. Dyke Road—the ancient route from Brighton to Devil's Dyke and Steyning and eventually on to London—forms the conservation area's eastern boundary except at the southern end, where it extends east of the road to include St Nicholas Church (Brighton's original parish church), Wykeham Terrace and other small parts of West Hill. The land rises gently from the southwest to a summit at Clifton Hill. Writing in 1833, J.D. Parry said that the hill \\"commands a magnificent view, and has very fine air\\". John Constable, who stayed in Brighton several times during the 1820s, was less impressed: he described it as \\"hideous masses of unfledged earth called the country\\". Nevertheless, he produced several paintings of the area, which provide a record of its appearance just before it became suburbanised. Geologically, Montpelier is built on grassy downland and sheep-pasture, beneath which is chalk. This pattern is repeated across the rest of the city, most of the Sussex coast and for several miles inland. The chalk, \\"one of the most complete and accessible strata anywhere in Europe\\", was formed about 100 million years ago. As in other areas where chalk is prevalent, the soil above it is rendzina. Found in thin layers and with a high calcium content, it has a poor agricultural value. In common with the rest of Brighton, the area has a temperate climate: its Köppen climate classification is Cfb. It is characterised by mild, calm weather with high levels of sunshine, sea breezes and a \\"healthy, bracing air\\" attributed to the low level of tree cover. Average rainfall levels increase as the land rises: the 1958–1990 mean was on the seafront and about at the top of the South Downs above Brighton. Locally, a distinction is made between the northern part of the area towards the top of the hill—this area is known as Clifton or Clifton Hill—and the lower land to the south and west, as far as the Hove boundary and Western Road, known as Montpelier. The names are also used interchangeably, and some sources make further distinctions: the area around Powis Grove, Powis Villas, Powis Road and St Michael and All Angels Church is called Powis in one study of the area. Although Montpelier first appears as the name of the area on a map of 1824, this still makes it the earliest Montpelier in England—predating those in Bristol, Cheltenham and elsewhere in taking and adapting the name of the French spa resort Montpellier. The town was popular with rich English people in the 18th century for convalescence: it had an excellent climate and good medical facilities. The term \\"Montpelier Estate\\" is sometimes used for the area as a whole. Demography and politics Montpelier and Clifton Hill are predominantly residential: about 20% of buildings have other uses, primarily commercial and retail. Some areas have clusters of small shops, and there are many pubs and restaurants. The southern part of Montpelier is very close to Brighton's main retail area, Western Road and the Churchill Square shopping centre. Many streets provide long southward views towards the sea. The area forms part of Brighton and Hove City Council's Regency ward, one of 21 wards in the city. This is part of the Brighton Pavilion parliamentary constituency, which elected Caroline Lucas of the Green Party at the 2010 General Election. She held the seat with an increased majority at the 2015 General Election. Regency is classified as a \\"Prospering Metropolitan B\\" ward by the Office for National Statistics. 0.91% of the United Kingdom population live in such a ward, whose characteristics include much lower proportions of children, manufacturing sector workers, detached houses and households with more than one car than the national average, and much higher proportions of single-person households, people qualified to degree level and privately rented accommodation than the average. Population density is also much higher in Prospering Metropolitan B wards than in the United Kingdom as a whole. The Regency ward covers of central Brighton, bounded by Seven Dials to the north, the ancient Brighton/Hove parish boundary to the west, the English Channel to the south and Dyke Road, North Street and Old Steine to the east. It therefore includes territory that is not part of Montpelier, whose southern boundary at Western Road runs through the middle of the ward. At the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001, for which the size of the ward was measured at , Regency had a population of 8,510. Its population density of 96.25 persons per hectare was much higher than that of the city Brighton and Hove (29.98) and of South East England as a whole (4.2). The ethnic mix is similar to that of the wider city and of South East England as a whole: in the Census, 93.3% of people in Regency classified themselves as White, 2.1% as Mixed, 1.88% as Asian or Asian British, 1.79% as Chinese or Other, and 0.93% as Black British. The largest differences in comparison to Brighton and Hove overall were the lower proportion of White people and the higher proportion belonging to Chinese or other ethnic groups. The gender balance is significantly different from that of the city as a whole: while 48.38% of Brighton and Hove's residents were male (as recorded by the 2001 Census), the proportion rose to 54.49% of people in Regency ward. History Before its development, the present Montpelier area was known as Church Hill in reference to St Nicholas Church. The Temple was built for Thomas Read Kemp in 1819 just before suburban growth started. The South Downs, a range of chalk hills, surrounded the ancient fishing and farming village of Brighton (formerly Brighthelmston). The downland pasture sloped down to the English Channel coast and was farmed in one of two ways: some parts were divided into strips according to a local system of \\"laines\\", furlongs\\" and \\"paul-pieces\\", and other areas were left for the grazing of sheep. The area now covered by Montpelier was an example of the latter. The five laines around Brighton were based on land with a relatively gentle slope; when the gradient or height made the land too difficult to work, no more strips were marked out and the rest of the land was given over to grazing. A map of Brighton from the 1740s shows that a large section in the northwest of the parish—north of West Laine, west of North Laine and bisected by the road to Steyning—was marked as \\"sheep down\\". It had no official name at the time, but by 1792 it had become known as Church Hill in reference to St Nicholas Church, the parish church of Brighton which stood on a hillock near the road. The part west of the road was sometimes described as \\"Church Hill – West Side\\"; the corresponding \\"East Side\\" later became known as West Hill during Brighton's 19th-century growth. The road became a turnpike in 1777, increasing its importance, and became known as Dyke Road. Vine's Mill, one of several windmills built on the Downs around Brighton, was erected in 1810. The sheep down was not common land: its ownership has been traced back to the 11th century (to Canute, Earl Godwin and his son King Harold), and by the late 18th century it was held by two influential local landowners. Thomas Kemp held about , and John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset owned over . When Kemp died in 1811, his landholding transferred to his son Thomas Read Kemp. The Kemp family first acquired the land in 1770, when it was sold to them by the Friend family—whose history of large-scale land acquisition around Brighton goes back to the late 16th century and the purchase of the former St Bartholomew's Priory and its grounds. 53–56 Montpelier Road are among \\"[Montpelier's] best houses\\". Thomas Read Kemp had moved out of Brighton in 1807, but decided to return in 1819. By this time he was enjoying \\"a rich social life\\" and his considerable inherited wealth. As he owned so much land around Brighton, there were many sites he could choose for his new home; he selected a remote site near the track (running from the seafront to the Ditchling Road) which later became Montpelier Road. At the time there were only three people living on the farmland of \\"Church Hill – West Side\\", including an eccentric former marine corporal who occupied a cave in a former chalk pit. He had been invalided out of the Navy after fighting in the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801, but retained his military interest: he made chalk models to sell, and rigged up four pistols to form a miniature battery which he would fire to celebrate military anniversaries. Read Kemp's house, probably designed by Amon Wilds or his son Amon Henry Wilds, was called The Temple (and was popularly nicknamed \\"Kemp's Folly\\" or \\"the Brighton Mansion\\"). He may have chosen the secluded site because it was close to the chalybeate spring at St Ann's Well in the neighbouring parish of Hove, popularised by Dr Richard Russell in the 1750s but known to generations of shepherds before that for the health-giving effect it had on their sheep. The iron-rich water was used in \\"a primitive little spa\\" for about 100 years, and the associated Pump Room and gardens were popular with visitors long after that. Montpelier Lodge was unusual in its use of red brickwork. St Michael and All Angels Church is in the background. The increasing popularity of Brighton as a resort resulted in an \\"exponential growth in housing\\". In 1783, just after the first expansion outside the ancient four-street village, there were 600 houses; in 1801 there were 1,282, by 1811 another 1,096 had been completed, and in 1821 there were 4,299. The land of Church Hill was ideal for development—land ownership was not complex, unlike in many of the laines, and the sheltered southwest-facing slopes were close to both St Ann's Well and the centre of Brighton's fashionable social scene around Old Steine. The area developed rapidly as a residential district from the 1820s, and was one of the earliest of Brighton's many 19th-century suburbs. From 1823, Read Kemp became heavily involved in his speculative Kemp Town estate on the edge of Brighton, and he moved to a house there in 1827 (after which The Temple became a boys' school). He began selling plots of land throughout the area, and streets and areas of housing took shape. Montpelier Road was one of the first to develop, on the site of the long track which had given Read Kemp access to the seafront from his house; it is not named before 1820, but it appears on a map of 1822. Houses such as numbers 53–56, by Amon Henry Wilds, and the semi-detached villas of numbers 91–96, date from about 1830. Hampton Place, a sloping terrace of \\"especially pretty houses\\", was an 1820s development by speculator William Hallett, who occupied one of the houses himself. Around the same time, Amon Henry Wilds and Charles Busby built several houses on a former track which became Clifton Road, and work started at Montpelier Terrace with the construction of a pair of villas in 1823. Montpelier Lodge ( 1830) on Montpelier Terrace stood out from the surrounding stuccoed buildings due to its red-brick walls; it also had an elaborate entrance with Doric columns and a delicately patterned fanlight. Development accelerated after Thomas Read Kemp was declared bankrupt in 1837, forcing him to sell all his land and move to France. Parcels of land were rapidly developed with terraced streets (especially to the south, leading up from Western Road) and set-piece squares and crescents. The Temple was still isolated until 1834–35, when the firm of George Cheesman & Son built a new vicarage for the Vicar of Brighton Henry Michell Wagner. The \\"austere Neo- Tudor\\" house stood back from the nearest road. In about 1840, Wagner's sister moved to the newly built Belvedere House nearby, and encouraged development of the adjacent road which became Montpelier Place. (The four-storey houses of Belvedere Terrace were built on her behalf in the grounds of Belvedere House in about 1852.) Brighton was connected to the railway network in 1840 when a line to Shoreham-by-Sea opened, followed in 1841 by the completion of the link to London. This stimulated growth even further, and the 1840s were a boom period for Montpelier. (Brighton as a whole grew rapidly in the 1840s—between 1841 and 1851, 2,806 new houses were built compared to 437 for the preceding decade—but the effect was greater in Montpelier because the station was close by at the foot of West Hill.) During the 1840s, Montpelier Villas and Montpelier Crescent were laid out, several houses were built in Clifton Road, Montpelier Road and Montpelier Terrace were fully built up, Upper North Street became an important route lined with \\"modest yet grandly treated\\" houses, the \\"very attractive composition\\" of Clifton Terrace was built (it was finished in 1847), Victoria Street was laid out with bay-fronted terraced houses, and Windlesham House was constructed near The Temple. This became the New Sussex Hospital in 1921 after alterations by the Clayton & Black architecture firm, but is now flats called Temple Heights. Developments in the 1850s included Powis Square, Villas and Road, Norfolk Terrace and Vernon Terrace. The Powis area took its name from property developer John Yearsley, who was from Welshpool in Powys. Yearsley bought several acres of land on a leasehold basis from the Kemp family in 1846; he acquired the freehold soon after. (Thomas Read Kemp died in France in 1844, seven years after leaving Brighton to escape his debts.) Land was also acquired and developed by the prominent Hallett, Wisden, Baring and Faithfull families. (The Baring baronets were related to Thomas Read Kemp by marriage; Henry Faithfull, who worked with Yearsley to develop the Powis area, was the brother of MP George Faithfull; and Thomas and John Wisden were prolific builders.) York Mansions occupy the part of the site of the former New Sussex Hospital for Women. Denmark Terrace, a continuation of Vernon Terrace, was erected in the 1860s; at its south end it met Temple Gardens, the road on which The Temple stood. Also of the 1860s were parts of Norfolk Road (where development had started 30 years before), St Michael's Place (1868–69) with terraced houses \\"impressive in their length and height\\", and some infill development in Montpelier Terrace, Clifton Place, Powis Road and Vernon Terrace. Montpelier's residential development was nearly complete by the 1870s, as suggested by an Ordnance Survey map of that time which shows undeveloped fields only in the area beyond Vernon Terrace. In 1870 or 1871, Brighton Children's Hospital—established three years earlier in Western Road—moved to a new building on the site of the former Church Road School in West Hill. In 1880–81, Thomas Lainson built the new Royal Alexandra Hospital for Sick Children nearby at the junction of Dyke Road and Clifton Hill. It was extended and altered in 1904, 1906 and 1927–28. Some more houses were built in the Edwardian era, mostly in the characteristic Edwardian style with bright red brick \\"standing out amongst the stucco\\". Examples include some in Temple Gardens and Vernon Gardens in the 1890s, a row on one side of Denmark Terrace, Windlesham Road (where numbers 14 and 16, built in 1903, are especially elaborate) and 18–25 Clifton Road (1903–04, with ornate gables and turreted corners). In 1902, the London & Brighton Express Electric Railway Company sought permission to build a new surface railway line from Westminster to a terminus near the junction of Montpelier Road and Western Road, passing Clifton Hill. Hove Council supported the parliamentary Bill, but nothing came of it; when the promoters proposed it again in 1903, the council were no longer interested. Additions and alterations to the streetscape have been minimal since the early 20th century. Windlesham House became the New Sussex Hospital for Women in 1921 following alterations by Clayton & Black, who similarly rebuilt a 19th-century house on Montpelier Road as a chapel for Brighton's Christian Scientist community in the same year. The hospital was extended to the rear in the 1930s (but new flats called York Mansions were built on the site in 2001), and the Royal Alexandra Hospital absorbed a neighbouring villa. Additions to the Brighton & Hove High School, which had taken over The Temple, included a \\"drab\\" set of classrooms in the 1960s, a later administration block and a glazed sports hall in 2001–02 (the last two were designed by architects Morgan Carn Partnership). Demolitions included the former Emanuel Reformed Episcopal Church on Norfolk Terrace (replaced by a Baptist church) in 1965, The Dials Congregational Church in 1972 (built in 1871; replaced by sheltered accommodation) and Belvedere House (replaced in the 1970s by the Park Royal flats). Other blocks of flats were built in that decade on spare land on Montpelier Terrace and Clifton Terrace. Buildings Churches St Michael and All Angels Church was built in two stages between 1858 and 1895. The Montpelier and Clifton Hill areas have four extant churches and one former church building which is now in secular use. Three of these buildings have listed status. Another five churches were demolished in the postwar period. The Anglican St Michael and All Angels Church has been a centre of Anglo-Catholicism and High church worship since it opened in 1861. It was one of several daughter churches planted out of St Paul's Church in the early Victorian era. George Frederick Bodley designed the original building on behalf of his friend Rev. Charles Beanlands, a curate at St Paul's, and work started in 1858. William Burges then supplied plans for an extension in 1865, but these were not executed until 1893–95 by J.S. Chapple, an architect from the recently deceased Burges' office. The two parts are connected by a four-bay arcade inside, and Bodley's original nave has become an aisle. The building is a tall red-brick and stone Gothic Revival structure with traceried lancet windows. The internal fittings combine \\"grandeur and artistry in a most satisfying way\\", and the 19th-century stained glass has been called the best in Sussex. The church is Grade I-listed. Clayton & Black converted a house into the First Church of Christ, Scientist in 1921. St Mary Magdalen's Church, another brick and stone Gothic Revival building, was designed for the area's Roman Catholics in 1861–64 by Gilbert Blount. Frederick Walters added a complementary school and presbytery in 1871 and 1891 respectively, and the complex takes up a large site on Upper North Street. A tall tower with a landmark broach spire stands almost separated from the Decorated Gothic nave and chancel. The interior has contrasting stone (intricately carved to Blount's designs) and marble, and Joseph Cribb carved the effigies of Saint Joseph and Saint George which flank the entrance. St Mary Magdalen's has Grade II-listed status. The First Church of Christ, Scientist, serving the city's Christian Scientists, is a \\"notable\\" former house on Montpelier Road. It was built in the early 1850s and was converted into a church by local architects Clayton & Black in 1921. The exterior is rusticated and has an elaborate pediment and large pilasters flanking the tiered windows. A panelled gallery survives inside. St Stephen's Church is now a daycare centre. Brighton & Hove Central Spiritualist Church is based in a building on Boundary Passage. It was registered for marriages in April 1984. The church previously occupied part of a house on Norfolk Terrace, for which a worship registration granted in April 1966 was revoked in February 1980. The Grade II*-listed former St Stephen's Church on Montpelier Place closed in 1939 and is now used as a day centre for homeless people. George Cheesman designed the plain stuccoed Classical façade, with Doric pilasters and an octagonal lantern, in 1851. Behind it lies the opulent former ballroom of the Castle Inn, built by John Crunden in 1776 and later transported to Montpelier Place. Arthur Blomfield made additions to the church in 1889. It was refurbished after a fire in 1988. Christ Church stood on Montpelier Road south of Western Road between 1837 and 1982. George Cheesman designed it and Edmund Scott undertook restoration in 1886; both architects worked on other local churches as well. The Gothic Revival building had a galleried interior and a spire matching that at Chichester Cathedral. It was gutted in an arson attack in 1978; the exterior survived, but it was demolished in 1982 in favour of the International/Modern-style Christ Church House flats. The congregation of the church moved to nearby St Patrick's Church. The Dials Congregational Church stood at the junction of Clifton Road and Dyke Road (the site of the present Homelees House) between 1870 and 1972, although it closed in 1969. Its \\"Rhenish helm\\"-topped clock tower was prominent on the skyline, and behind was a large horseshoe-shaped auditorium. The Romanesque Revival building, described as \\"uncouth\\" by Nikolaus Pevsner, was designed by local architect Thomas Simpson. Work on Homelees House, a sheltered housing scheme, began in 1985. Norfolk Road Methodist Church, designed by C.O. Ellison, stood on Norfolk Road from 1868 until 1965. It was a large Early English/Decorated Gothic Revival flint and stone building with a tower and spire, and it had an extensive array of stained glass. Externally and internally—where the main aisle led the eye to the central altar, and the lectern and pulpit stood to one side—there was little to distinguish it from an Anglican church, and it was known as the \\"Methodist Cathedral of the South\\". Demographic changes meant the congregation dwindled, and the church closed in 1964 and was demolished the following year to be replaced by Braemar House, a large block of flats with a \\"bland red-brick façade\\". E. Joseph Wood's Montpelier Place Baptist Church of 1966–67 was built on the site of the former Emanuel Reformed Episcopal Church. The low brown-brick building stood on a corner site at the south-west end of Norfolk Terrace, straddling the ancient parish boundary. There were echoes of Coventry Cathedral in the treatment of the façade, which had two gabled bays linked by an arcaded wall with a sawtooth-style roof. Each bay had vertical rows of recessed bricks. A flat-roofed church hall adjoined. The church closed in 2012, was squatted in 2014 and was proposed for demolition and replacement with flats in 2017. Demolition took place soon after planning permission was granted in October 2017. Other public buildings Thomas Lainson designed the former children's hospital on Dyke Road. The Royal Alexandra Hospital for Sick Children, \\"an important part of Brighton life and a well known local landmark\\", was officially opened on 21 July 1881 and was used until 22 June 2007, when a new children's hospital opened on the Royal Sussex County Hospital campus elsewhere in the city. Designed by Thomas Lainson, it was a three-storey Queen Anne-style building of red brick with terracotta dressings and mouldings, enlivened by Dutch gables, cupolas and a moulded cartouche. Extensions included a colonnade of balconies (later enclosed) by the Clayton & Black firm in 1906 and a Vernacular-style recessed wing of two storeys in 1927–28, partly tile-hung and with timber decoration to the gables. The first mention of its potential closure came in 2001, when the Government allocated £28 million towards new facilities at the Royal Sussex County Hospital on Eastern Road in Kemptown. By 2004, it seemed likely that the building would be demolished and the site redeveloped with luxury flats. Montpelier residents were unsuccessful in their attempt to get the former hospital listed by English Heritage, who stated that Lainson's original design had been altered so much that much of its character had been lost. Taylor Wimpey, a housebuilding company, bought the hospital in December 2006, but their proposals to clear the site and build a combined residential development and GP surgery were refused twice by the city council, in 2007 and 2008. In 2009 Taylor Wimpey appealed against the latest refusal to grant planning permission for 149 flats and a four-day public inquiry was held at Brighton Town Hall in May 2009. The local conservation group, the Montpelier and Clifton Hill Association, led the opposition to Taylor Wimpey's plans to demolish the hospital. The planning inspector, John Papworth, turned down Taylor Wimpey's appeal, praising the architectural quality of Thomas Lainson's main building. \\"I consider that the main block and particularly its southern façade and the southern end of the Dyke Road frontage contribute positively to the character and appearance of the conservation area,” said Papworth. In 2010 Taylor Wimpey abandoned its plans to clear the site and put forward a compromise plan, which kept the main Lainson building but demolished the later ancillary buildings on the site. This plan, which was supported by the Montpelier and Clifton Hill Association was approved by the council in 2011. Flats on the site went on sale (marketed as Royal Alexandra Quarter) in 2012. The iconic main hospital building, to be called the Lainson building, is currently being restored and converted to provide 20 flats. Brighton and Hove High School's sixth-form is in the former Brighton vicarage. The Temple, now the main part of Brighton and Hove High School, was built in 1818–19 by Amon Wilds or his son Amon Henry Wilds, and has been described as \\"certainly exotic enough for their tastes\\". The Wilds, along with Charles Busby, were the three architects most closely associated with the development of Brighton and Hove in the Regency era and the exuberant, confident and strongly planned architecture which still characterises the city. The Temple was an early commission: they only moved to Brighton in 1814. The north and east walls retain their original appearance: long colonnades are formed by a series of arches on top of paired vertical features of \\"bizarre form\\". These have unusual capitals and have been described as resembling Egyptian-style pilasters or engaged columns. The west and south façades also had these, but the building was drastically altered in 1911–12: the domed roof was replaced by a mansard, a curious central spiral staircase housed in a cylindrical structure was removed, and chimneys were taken away. The dimensions of the building match those of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem. The Temple is a Grade II listed building, and the large flint and brick wall surrounding the building is also listed at Grade II; it is decorated with stone lion heads. An extension was also built at the southwest corner in 1891. Junior pupils shared the building with the senior school until 1904, after which they moved several times: to Norfolk Terrace, Montpelier Crescent, the former vicarage (in 1922) and finally to new facilities in Hove. The former vicarage is now the school's sixth-form. George Cheesman & Son designed it on behalf of Vicar of Brighton Henry Michell Wagner in 1834–35; it is a stuccoed building with prominent gables and windows with mullions and transoms. An ornate staircase survives inside. Residential squares and terraces =Clifton Terrace= Clifton Terrace sits behind a raised pavement. The west side of Denmark Terrace (Vernon Gardens) has some early 20th-century red-brick houses. Montpelier Crescent's houses have prominent pediments. Vernon Terrace has houses of various heights. This runs east–wast across the slope of the hill, and has private gardens on the site of the former windmill which moved to Albion Hill in 1837. Most construction work took place in 1846–47, but the 23-house terrace and its gardens were not finished until 1851. The houses combine the Regency-style \\"gaiety and exuberance\\" with the \\"charm and vigour\\" of Victorian architecture, and the use of angled bay windows set below tented canopies is a late example of this distinctive local practice. Each house is built as a villa, mostly with a three-window range shared across two neighbouring houses (the middle window is blank). Numbers 12–14 project slightly and are taller. The houses are raised above the roadway, giving views into the private gardens on the south side and \\"a commanding view of the sea\\". Number 25, which stands separately and was also listed, was originally the Clifton Arms pub. =Denmark Terrace= The \\"heavy Italianate detailing\\" of the large four- storey bay-fronted houses on the east side identifies them as 1860s buildings. There are prominent cornices and pairs of porches whose style is reminiscent of the work of 18th-century architect James Gibbs, and some houses are also linked by iron balconies on the top floor (a balcony runs along the whole length of the terrace at first-floor level). \\"Cheery\\" red-brick Edwardian houses face the terrace. =Montpelier Crescent= Described as \\"the one great showpiece of the area\\" and \\"the grandest of [Amon Henry Wilds'] many works\\", this crescent was developed over about 12 years from 1843. The main section, numbers 7–31, was built between 1843 and 1847 and is Grade II*-listed. A further 13 houses (listed at Grade II) were added in four blocks, two at each end, in about 1855. The houses are arranged as linked villas, alternating between triplets and pairs: this layout is unique, and the placement of the crescent to face inland towards the South Downs rather than the sea is also unusual. Most houses are of five bays with a central pediment. Recessed entrances, Corinthian pilasters topped by ammonite capitals and decorative mouldings characterise the houses. The gardens in front of the crescent are an important area of open space within the conservation area. =Montpelier Villas= Ten pairs of \\"delightful\\" semi-detached villas, five on each side of the road, make up this mid-1840s development by Amon Henry Wilds. They are in the Italianate style with influences of Regency architecture, and have two bow windows with bonnet-style canopies above, stuccoed walls with extensive rustication, prominently bracketed eaves and cast iron balconies. The \\"charming\\" houses are set in spacious plots in a former bluebell wood. The street was completed over the course of three years from about 1845. All of the villas are listed buildings. =Norfolk Terrace, Norfolk Road and Belvedere Terrace= Norfolk Terrace is an 1850s development. On the west side, the first (northernmost) 13 houses are a tall terrace by Thomas Lainson, arranged as four pairs of flat-fronted houses with a wider central elevation whose windows are large and round-arched. The building is in the Italianate style. South of that, the next six houses (with segmental bay windows and cast iron balconies) have become the Abbey Hotel. Belvedere Terrace, built in 1852 for Mary Wagner, forms part of the east side of the road. It has four storeys, bow windows and balconies at first-floor level. Two blocks of flats now occupy the site of Belvedere House, demolished in 1965, but its cobbled flint garden wall survives. Various smaller-scale houses, some of which are listed, line Norfolk Road, which developed between the 1830s and the 1860s; canted bay windows and cast iron balconies are characteristic features. The street used to be called Chalybeate Street. =Powis Grove, Road, Square and Villas= Powis Square is a rare example in Brighton of a fully enclosed inland square: most such developments are on the seafront, and its architectural details and scale are similar to these. It is horseshoe-shaped, and one side is formed by Powis Road. The square was developed by John Yearsley over a few years around 1850: the leasehold to the land was granted on 17 September 1846, and in 1852 seven people had moved in and another 14 houses were built but unoccupied. In some cases façades were built first and the structure of the house came later. A builder called Stephen Davey was responsible for many of the houses, which were originally planned to be flat-fronted but which were given bow fronts when built. They rise to three storeys and have features of Georgian, Victorian and Palladian design. A small garden in the centre of the square, taken over by Brighton Corporation in 1887, enhances its intimate scale. Powis Road's houses are not listed, unlike those of Powis Square, and were built a decade later. They also have three storeys, and their façades have canted bay windows and cast iron balconies. St Michael and All Angels Church stands at the southern end. Powis Grove leads through to the east side of Powis Square and has various buildings of the mid 19th-century, and Powis Villas has some listed detached and semi- detached houses of the 1850s and a short terrace with a long canopied veranda. =Vernon Terrace= This long, tall terrace of houses blocked the view of the South Downs that Montpelier Crescent had when it was first built. Along with the crescent, it forms \\"a townscape of outstanding quality\\". Only the west side of the road has houses, as the open space outside Montpelier Crescent fronts the east side. The terrace is in two parts: that to the south dates from the 1850s and is Grade II-listed in two parts. Numbers 1–6 have been dated to about 1860 and rise to three storeys (except numbers 1 and 6, which have an extra storey). Their individual detailing is slightly different, but pilastered doorcases, architraves, first-floor cast iron balconies and small pediments above the windows are common themes. Numbers 7–16 date from 1856–57 and are each of four storeys with a three-window range; there is a mixture of bow windows and canted bays. Many windows have architraves and cornices, and there are bow-fronted cast iron balconies at first-floor level (and to the second and third floors at number 8). Windmills Vine's Mill, a post mill, only took that name in 1818. William Vine moved to the area from Patcham, where he had previously been a miller, in August 1818, having bought the mill at a recent auction. A house came with the windmill; it survives under the name \\"Rose Cottage\\" on Vine Place, which also took its name from him (it was previously called Mill Place). A storm in 1828 damaged the mill, but it was repaired. It was the subject of two paintings by Constable in the 1820s and a locally famous watercolour by Henry Bodle, who married into the Vine family, in 1843. By this time Vine had died and the mill had been bought by Edward Cuttress of Round Hill. It was demolished in 1849 or 1850, and the gardens at 6 and 7 Powis Villas now occupy the site. A second windmill stood nearby and has been confused with Vine's Mill in some sources. It is missed off most maps and has been called \\"something of an enigma\\". It was a fan- tailed post mill, larger than Vine's Mill and of a more modern design—although one historian stated that it existed in 1780. It did not receive an official name until the mid-19th century, by which time it had been moved to Windmill Street on Albion Hill in the Carlton Hill area of Brighton: because it had stood where the private gardens of Clifton Terrace were later built, it became known as the Clifton Gardens Mill. The Windmill Inn on Upper North Street, licensed in 1828, is close to the site of both mills; sources disagree on which one it was named after. The Coach House The Coach House, a \\"rare survival\\", dates from 1852. Now a Grade II listed building, The Coach House stands on Clifton Hill. It was built as the coach house of Aberdeen Lodge (now 5 Powis Villas). Statue-maker Joseph Rogers Browne built this house for himself, along with the neighbouring villas at numbers 6 and 7. He later wanted accommodation for his carriages, so in 1852 he erected the brick, flint and stucco building with space for two coaches and three horses. There was also a hay loft and a separate room for the coachman, and the exterior had Coade stone decoration. By the 1920s it had become a garage; in 1937, after this closed, the Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital bought it and used it to store their ambulances. Local conservationists set up a limited company, which bought the building in 2006, intending to turn it into a community centre and museum; but it was repossessed in 2008 and was thereafter used for storage by a clothes shop. In its assessment of the building's architectural importance when granting listed status in 2005, English Heritage described it as a \\"substantially intact and rare survival\\" with \\"polite architectural and sculptural features\\". Heritage and conservation area A building or structure is defined as \\"listed\\" when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of \\"special architectural or historic interest\\" by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, a Government department, in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. English Heritage, a non-departmental public body, acts as an agency of this department to administer the process and advise the department on relevant issues. As of February 2001, there were 24 listed buildings with Grade I status, 70 Grade II*-listed and 1,124 Grade II-listed buildings in Brighton and Hove. Grade I-listed buildings are defined as being of \\"exceptional interest\\" and greater than national importance; Grade II*, the next highest status, is used for \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\"; and the lowest grade, Grade II, is used for \\"nationally important buildings of special interest\\". Many of Montpelier's buildings are listed: in 1981, 320 individual buildings were covered by an English Heritage listing, and the figure in 2010 was 351. In the United Kingdom, a conservation area is a principally urban area \\"of special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance\\". Such areas are identified by local authorities according to criteria defined by Sections 69 and 70 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The Montpelier & Clifton Hill conservation area, one of 34 in the city of Brighton and Hove, was created in 1973. Its boundaries were extended in 1977, and it now covers . Notable residents Frederick William Robertson lived at two houses in Montpelier near the end of his life. Many famous people have lived in Montpelier. Sara Forbes Bonetta, an African princess who became a favourite of Queen Victoria, lived at 17 Clifton Hill prior to her marriage at St Nicholas Church in 1862 to a merchant who lived at Victoria Road; she was unhappy in Brighton, describing the house as a \\"desolate little pigsty\\". Frederick William Robertson, a preacher, theologian and divine whose ministry at Brighton's Holy Trinity Church was nationally famous, lived at 9 Montpelier Terrace from 1847 until 1850, then at 60 Montpelier Road until his death in 1853. Another resident of Montpelier Road was Dr William King, an important figure in the British cooperative movement, who owned number 23. Eleanor Marx lived at 6 Vernon Terrace for a time in the late 19th century. Screenwriter Edward Knoblock's home was at 20 Clifton Terrace, and another resident of that street was playwright and author Alan Melville: he lived at number 17 from 1951 until 1973 and then at 28 Victoria Street until his death in 1983. Author Francis King lived at 17 Montpelier Villas, close to the 5 Powis Grove home of former MP Thomas Skeffington-Lodge. He look legal action after noticing an \\"unflattering\\" resemblance to himself in King's 1970 novel A Domestic Animal; King had to sell his house to pay the legal costs after losing the case. Journalist and television personality Gilbert Harding—\\"the most-watched man on British television\\" during the 1950s—lived at 20 Montpelier Villas until his death in 1960. Bandleader Ray Noble's birthplace, 1 Montpelier Terrace, has a blue plaque commemorating his time in Brighton.

In 2004, the Fünf Höfe was sold to DIFA (today Union Investment Real Estate AG) and since then the official name has been CityQuartier Fünf Höfe.  General Information  In total, the Fünf Höfe offers their visitors, on the approximately 14,000 square meter area, around 60 stores and about 2,500 square meters of cafés and restaurants. They also include the Hypo-Kunsthalle (approximately 3,200 m² of floor space), which displays temporary exhibitions on changing themes, artists and epochs. In addition, there are 24,300 m² of office space as well as some 3,200 m² of apartments, which from the passages are hardly noticeable. The shops and pubs are predominantly related to the upscale price classes.  Building history  The plan for the redesign of the whole block was the first international competition success of Basel architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron in 1994. The client was the Fünf Höfe GmbH & Co KG represented through HVB Immobilien AG (a subsidiary of the then HypoVereinsbank) In the long-term preservation of the façades and parts of the old building, Herzog & de Meuron radically altered the old town block, which had been closed down until then, and made it into an ensemble of courtyards and passages with different views and insights, in which each courtyard should have its own character. In the first phase, completed on 8 February 2001, the Perusa- and Portiahof as well as the Pranner- and a part of the Salvatorpassage and the Hypo-Kunsthalle were created. The architect Ivano Gianola planned the Maffeihof and designed the area to the south of the Fünf Höfe into the Schäfflerhof. In the second phase, which was inaugurated on 19 March 2003, the Munich architecture firm Hilmer & Sattler und Albrecht designed the façade to Salvatorstrasse.  Art  Some of the courtyards and passages are decorated with works of art: * In the Salvatorpassage the \\"Hanging Gardens\\" by Tita Giese was installed. * In the Prannerpassage, glass sequined mosaics made of round-cut, clear window glass are inserted into the gray exposed concrete in the walls and ceilings on 317 m² of the Mayer'sche Hofkunstanstalt, creating a glitter effects. * The \\"Sphere\\", a large hanging ball made of steel mesh designed by Olafur Eliasson, is displayed in the Viscardihof.

It is operated by Messe München.  Location and transport  The exhibition center was built on the northern half of the former Munich-Riem airport. It is bordered by the south Willy-Brandt-Allee and the residential development of Riem Messestadt and Riem arcades, there are also the two underground stations for the U2 line, Messestadt West and East located there. The Bundesautobahn 94 passes to the north and the exhibition grounds are connected with two highway exits. Further north is the S-Bahn station in Munich-Riem, where the transportation of freight to the fairgrounds runs since 2001. A direct connection of the S-Bahn to the fairgrounds is being discussed throughout the course of the construction of the Erding Ring Closure, which would also allow for a direct connection to the new Munich Airport.  Terrain and buildings  The heart of the exhibition grounds are 16 exhibition halls with a total of 180,000 m2 of exhibition space with the added, when needed, additional 360,000 m2 of open area to the north and east of the site. The two main entrances are located on the western and eastern end, these are connected by a 650 m long and 35 m wide atrium, which allow access to the twelve halls. Located at the western entrance is the International Congress Centre (ICM), the exhibition hall and the Messesee. An 86 meter high fair tower stands at the eastern entrance. Architects were Bystrup Architecture Design Engineering, Bregenhøj + Partners, Kaup, Scholz, Jesse + Partner. At the third entrance, to the north, a press center with the World Cup fountain was established for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, it has since been used by Messe München. Upon the completion of construction, the world's largest photovoltaic system was installed on the roof of the exhibition halls. The system produces about 1,000 MWh of electricity annually. At the north-eastern and south-western end of the show, there are two parking garages with a total of about 5,700 parking spaces. The outdoor area is used as additional parking space or additional exhibition space for major fairs, such as Bauma. In May 2016 two more halls will be built northeast of the existing building. The €93 million expansion should have been started as early as 2013 according to the Messe München GmbH, but its shareholders, the city of Munich and Bavaria, requested an extension.  Messesee  View of the Messesee, in the background of the old airport tower West of the exhibition halls - between the former airport tower in the north and the metro station Messestadt West and the Willy-Brandt-Platz in the south - the 390 m long and 46 to 94 m wide Messesee is located with a water area of 2.6 ha . It is separated in the middle, creating a northern and southern part, by a causeway that runs to the main entrance. The road \\"Am Messesee\\" runs across the causeway as an extension of Joseph-Wild-Straße, it is used during trade fairs as an entrance taxis. The lake flows to the north of the causeway over one sheet pile, and to the south over two, so that a continuous flow of water is achieved; as a result, three water fountains which are in operation in the summer months, are located in pools. At the northern end, the water runs a stone filled infiltration basin. The banks are partially overgrown with reeds. At the entrance to the fair, the two-part installation Gran Paradiso from the Munich artist Stephan Huber, stands in the water since 1997.

The first section of the Pasing Arcaden was opened on the 15 of March 2011. It is located near the Pasing train station, in the west of Munich. The main entrance at the Pasing train station square opens up to the 270 meter long first section of the shopping area. This portion of the complex has a total area of 26,000 m2 and offers 14,000 m2 of space for 90 shops and boutiques. On 18 February 2013, the second section of Pasing Arcaden with an additional 50 shops and 11 catering establishments covering an area of 37,000 m2 was opened. Giovanni Trapattoni was the star guest at the opening. The total area of the Pasing Arcaden covers 63,000 m2, in which the total commercial area covers 39,000 m2. Making the Pasing Arcaden the fourth major shopping mall in Munich, after the Einkaufs-Center Neuperlach – pep, the Olympia-Einkaufszentrum, and the Riem Arcaden. The building was designed by the Munich architecture office of Allmann Sattler Wappner. The floor plan was designed similar to that of a cruise ship. The façade was designed with diamonds made of metal. The side of the building, adjacent to the railway tracks from Pasing to München Hauptbahnhof, is slightly curved, and the building height is more than 20 meters. The opposite longitudinal side of the building is approximately 10 meters high. The reason for this being the 45 three-to-five room apartments that were built in diagonal blocks on the roof of the Pasing Arcaden. Between the apartment blocks are large terraces that are available to the tenants. Additional commercial area has been planned. The walkways inside the shopping area do not run straight, but intertwine throughout the building. The shop facades are designed by the tenants themselves. Under the complex is a two- story underground parking area with 660 parking spaces. The management behind the Pasing Arcaden is the same as that for the Riem Arcaden, mfi Management für Immobilien AG, Essen. The first phase of construction costed a total of €190 million. The project schedule was delayed as a lawsuit with a neighbor interrupted construction works between 2008 and 2009.

On three further upper floors and an area of about 10,300 m² there are offices, a parking deck and a discotheque in the basement. Architecture After a public tender by the city of Munich in 2002, the contract for the design was awarded to the architectural firm Auer+Weber+Assoziierte. The futuristic exterior façade is based on the shape of an ICE powerhead, which was to fit in with the redesign of Munich's main railway station discussed at the time. Almost 31 km of tubes were used for the aluminium tube design, which is unique in Germany. Operation of the bus station Owner In 2014, the ZOB was acquired by the Munich issuing house WealthCapWealthCap komplettiert München-Portfolio, finanzwelt.de vom 4. August 2014, abgerufen am 11. November 2016., previously owned by the project developer Hochtief. The bus station is operated by the Bavarian Red Cross. User The bus station is mainly used by numerous long-distance bus operators, but also by tour operators. For example, buses operated by companies such as Flixbus or IC Bus, which offer national and international connections, regularly stop at the ZOB. Public buses are excluded, as the public transport connection is via Munich S-Bahn and Munich tramway. Fees Buses stopping at the ZOB pay 6.00 euros for half an hour and 11.00 euros for a full hour's stay at the opening.Münchner Merkur: „Leere Schalter am neuen Busbahnhof“, 31. August 2009, abgerufen am 2. Mai 2013. In 2018 the prices were 8.00 and 11.00 euros respectively. In addition, there are other price scales of up to 56.00 euros for the maximum permitted parking duration of 24 hours.Preisinformationen auf der offiziellen Website des ZOB München, abgerufen am 1. September 2018. Criticism The premises located above the bus stops were criticised for several years due to their initial lack of attractiveness for tenants. For the opening of the bus station, only six of the 17 rental spaces could be let. Due to the low customer frequency of only 1,500 persons per day compared to the planned 8,000 to 10,000, several tenants cut their payments to the project developer Hochtief in 2011, whereupon Hochtief filed a lawsuit.

They exhibit high firing rates, high force production, and very brief contraction times. Physiology Muscle contraction The muscle contraction of a ballistic muscle movement can exhibit a muscle coactivation of concurrent agonist Lee, J.B., Matsumoto, T., Othman, T., Yamauchi, M., Taimura, A., Kaneda, E., Ohwatari, N. and Kosaka, M. (1999) Coactivation of the flexor muscles as a synergist with the extensors during ballistic finger exetension movement in trained kendo and karate athletes. International Journal of Sports Medecine. 20(1): 7-11. and antagonist muscles or the characteristic triphasic agonist/antagonist/agonist muscle activation.Zehr, E.P. and Sale, D.G. (1994). Ballistic movement: Muscle activation and neuromuscular adaptation. Canadian Journal of Applied Physiology. 19(4): 363-378. Electromyography (EMG) recordings of demonstrate the triphasic muscle activation begins with a brief agonist motor unit activation signal with firing rates of 60 to 120 Hz that may last for 100ms and occurs 50 to 100ms before movement begins. The firing rates of ballistic movements are much higher than that of slow ramp movements (5–15 Hz). The brief agonist muscle contraction is thus followed by antagonist muscle unit activation. The degree of antagonist muscle unit activation is dependent on the task at hand unlike the first agonist muscle activation which is independent to environmental stimuli. The function of the antagonist muscle contraction is believed to control the amplitude and timing of ballistic movements. Antagonist muscle contraction may serve to prevent injury to joints by preventing the limb from overextending itself and also function to control the distance and time the limb is being moved. Experiments involving ballistic movement of small amplitudes show a marked increase in antagonist muscle activation and experiments where distance moved is not controlled antagonist muscle activation was decreased or absent.Zehr, E.P. and Sale, D.G. (1994). Ballistic movement: Muscle activation and neuromuscular adaptation. Canadian Journal of Applied Physiology. 19(4): 363-378. The second agonist muscle activation is suggested to terminate the negative acceleration of the antagonist muscle contraction and thus the ballistic movement. Power and energetics =Elastic storage of energy= Ballistic movements are often powered through elastic energy storage and subsequent recovery mechanisms. The power required to produce the extremely rapid velocities of ballistic movements is made possible through muscle work being stored in elastic elements (such as tendons, aponeuroses, or even muscle). Muscle work is applied to these elastic elements over a relatively slow period of time, and is released very rapidly.Lappin, A. K., Monroy, J. A., Pilarski, J. Q., Zepnewski, E. D., Pierotti, D. J. and Nishikawa, K. C. (2006). Storage and recovery of elastic potential energy powers ballistic prey capture in toads. Journal of Experimental Biology. 209: 2535-2553. Higher power output is produced because the energy is released in a much shorter amount of time than it is stored. In this sense the power of the muscles is actually amplified. When energy is produced by muscle contraction, stored in a tendon, then released to increase mechanical energy of the body (or body segment), muscle power is amplified. It is important to note, however, that the term power ‘amplification’ may be deceptive. In animals, elastic mechanisms never add energy to the system; they amplify power in the sense that the energy is released more rapidly than it is stored.Roberts, T. J. and Azizi, E. (2011) Flexible mechanisms: the diverse roles of biological springs in vertebrate movement. Journal of Experimental Biology. 214: 353-361. =Possible benefits= Ballistic systems are capable of power outputs that are significantly greater than that of the muscles associated with the actual movement. One prime example of this is tongue projection in salamanders.Deban, S. M., O’Reilly, J. C., Dicke, U. and van Leeuwen, J. L. (2007). Extremely high-power tongue projection in plethodontid salamanders. Journal of Experimental Biology. 210: 655-667. This decoupling of muscle work from body/limb work is a major benefit of elastic energy storage mechanisms. Another benefit resulting from this decoupling is decreased thermal dependence of ballistic movement.Deban, S.M. and Lappin, A.K. (2011). Thermal effects on the dynamics and motor control of ballistic prey capture in toads: maintaining high performance at low temperature. Journal of Experimental Biology. 214: 1333-134. Deban and Lappin analyzed the prey capture behavior of toads (Bufo terrestris), which involves two types of movement: elastically powered, ballistic movement (mouth opening and tongue projection) and muscle-powered movement (tongue retraction and mouth closing). The toad feeding was observed across a range of temperatures (11-35 °C), and the kinematic, dynamic, and electromyographic variables were measured and analyzed. Over the 11-35 °C temperature range, the ballistic movements had Q10 values very close to 1 (Q10 = 0.99-1.25), signifying thermal independence and supporting the main hypothesis. The muscle-powered movements had a higher temperature coefficient (Q10 = 1.77-2.26), signifying thermal dependence. Another example of a thermally independent ballistic movement is tongue projection in chameleons.Anderson, C. V. and Deban, S. M. (2010). Ballistic tongue projection in chameleons maintains high performance at low temperature. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA. 107:5495-5499. It was discovered that veiled chameleons (Chamaeleo calyptratus) were able to perform this high-performance tongue projection, and successful prey capture, across a wide range of temperatures (15 °C–35 °C). Anderson and Deban also found a contrast between thermal dependence of tongue projection and retraction (which is not elastically-powered). This further supports the hypothesis that the elastic recoil mechanism is responsible for the decreased thermal dependence of ballistic tongue projection. Examples Trap-jaw ants In trap-jaw ants (Odontomachus bauri) ballistic movement can be seen in their extremely rapid mandible strikes. The trap-jaw ants mandible has an average closing speed of 38.4 m/s and can produce forces that are 371-504 times the weight of the ant. The ants use these extremely powerful mandible strikes in several novel ways. When the ant attacks a larger animal it will strike the animal and at the same time use the force from the strike to propel itself away from the animal. When facing prey of similar size such as another ant the strike actually results in both animals being propelled away from each other. When the ant is trying to flee from a predator it will strike at the substrate and propel itself vertically into the air.Patek, N., Baio, J. E., Fisher, B. L., & Suarez, A. V. (2006). Multifunctionality and mechanical origins: Ballistic jaw propulsion in trap-jaw ants. PNAS, 103: 12787-12792. Crickets In crickets (Acheta domesticus) ballistic movements can be seen in the way they jump. The kicks that propel the cricket occur over a period of only 2-6ms, but during the 18-40ms prior to the kick the potential energy required is built up by the co-contraction of the antagonistic extensor and flexor tibiae. The crickets can also use these same ballistic movements for swimming.Hustert, R., & Baldus, M. (2010). Ballistic Movements of Jumping legs implemented as variable components of cricket behavior. Journal of Experimental Biology, 213: 4055-4064 Cone snail In the cone snail (Conus catus) ballistic movement can be seen in the way that it fires is harpoon-like radular tooth into its prey. After the cone snail’s proboscis comes in contact with its prey the tooth is ejected 240-295 ms later. It is believed that the propulsion of the tooth is accomplished by pressurizing the fluid space behind the tooth.Schulz, J. R., Norton, A. G., & Gilly, W. F. (2004). The Projectile Tooth of a Fish-Hunting Cone Snail: Conus catus inject Venom Into Fish Prey Using a High-Speed Ballistic Mechanism. Biol. Bull, 207: 77-79. Salamanders, toads, and chameleons In Salamanders, Toads, and Chameleons ballistic movement can be seen in their tongue projection which is controlled by an elastic recoil mechanism. The orientation of the muscle fibers is significant because it is what allows ballistic movements to be possible. In chameleons, the muscle fibers used for ballistic tongue movements were found to be in a spiral orientation, with an equal amount of fibers oriented clockwise and anti-clockwise to prevent torsional movement of the tongue during projection. The internal fiber angles are approximately 45 degrees, which is the theoretical optimum to create an equal strain throughout the accelerator muscles.Van Leeuwen, Johan L. (1997) Why the Chameleon Has Spiral- Shaped Muscle Fibres in its Tongue. Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences 352:1353 pp 573-589. In salamanders of the genus Hydromantes, the pattern of muscle activation has been mapped. The main muscles used for ballistic tongue movements in these salamanders are the subarcualis rectus (SAR) muscles. These SAR muscles can be further divided into anterior (SARA) and posterior (SARP). The first muscle to be activated is the SARA, which is located near the back of the head. The SARA remains active until the tongue makes contact with the prey. Next, the posterior SARP, located further back on the medial and lateral sides of the salamander is activated. Then the middle SARP is activated and the anterior SARP is the last to be activated. The time between activation shortens and duration of activation increases with increasing prey distance. Ballistic tongues have evolved two times previously in the Hemidactyliini and Bolitoglossini genera. The exact mechanisms of tongue projection vary slightly throughout the taxa, but the resulting projections have remained relatively constant.Deban, S.M and Dicke U. (2004). Activation Patterns of the Tongue-Projector Muscle During Feeding in Imperial Cave Salamander Hydromantes imperialis. Journal of Experimental Biology 207 pp 2071-2081. Frogs do not have a specialized muscular structure for tongue projection. They are able to bypass this issue by using very rapid jaw movement to project the tongue forward. Present in all frogs are the two mandibular muscles that are used to control the jaw and, therefore, tongue projection. The m. genioglossus is used to protract the tongue and the m.hyoglossus is the tongue retractor. Both of these muscles have longitudinally oriented fibers, which is in contrast to the spiral oriented fibers of the chameleon.Van Leeuwen J.L, De Groot J.H, Kier W.M (2000). Evolutionary Mechanics of Protrusible Tentacles an Tongues. Netherlands Journal of Zoology 50(2): 113-139. Application in humans In human, ballistic movements involve spontaneous propulsion of the limbs.Vitaladevuni, S.N.P. and Davis, L.S. (2007): Human Movement Analysis: Ballistic Dynamics, and Edge Continuity for Pose Estimation. University of Maryland: Computer Science Theses and Dissertations: http://hdl.handle.net/1903/2756 This can be seen in daily routines such as reach and strike reactions, which are atomic by nature. Pointing gestures and placing an object are reach reactions; they have low acceleration and deceleration. On the other hand, punching and throwing are strike reactions; they are characterized by high acceleration and deceleration. These movements have highly variable target locations, and they are referred to as “ballistic” in kinesiology. During ballistic movement an initial impulse is needed to accelerate the limb (hand/foot) toward the target, then a decelerating impulse act as a brake to stop the movement. These movements are characterized by a bell-shaped velocity profile. The Bayesian Model(see Bayesian network), which was developed to perform recognition without pose-tracking, explains human ballistic movement as a sequence of movements between objects and the environment. Each movement is independent from precedent and subsequent one, in varying context. Fast single joints movement in humans is controlled by a series of activation of agonist, antagonist and then agonist muscles; this process is called triphasic activation. Those movements are executed “with a pattern of bursts in the agonist and antagonist muscles of fairly constant duration but different amplitude…” (Acornero et al. 1984).Accornero, N., Berardelli, A., Argenta, M. and Manfredi M. (1984). Two joints ballistic arm movements. Neuroscience Letters. 46: 91-95. Any ballistic movement involving two joints will require an agonist and an antagonist burst; this can be viewed as the building blocks for different types of ballistic movements.

Headed by Alfred Wagenknecht, the NCCUI gathered a claimed 1.4 million petition signatures, which were presented to United States Congress amidst a heightened police presence on February 10, 1931. Three of the group's 140 delegates were expelled from the gallery of the U.S. Senate on that date for interrupting the debate. Organizational history With the deepening of the Great Depression in 1930, the Communist International (Comintern) based in Moscow began to see millions of unemployed workers around the world as a fertile field for the sowing of revolutionary ideas. Directives were issued to the member parties of the Comintern instructing that efforts be made for the organization of the unemployed and to attempt to build a mass movement around the demand for unemployment insurance.Harvey Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism: The Depression Decade. New York: Basic Books, 1984; pg. 54. To this end, the decision was made to form a new auxiliary of the Communist Party USA was established to direct the unemployment insurance campaign. On November 11, 1930, representatives of a number of the Communist Party's so-called \\"mass organizations\\" (pejoratively known as \\"front groups\\") were assembled at a conference held in New York City to establish a new organization known as the National Campaign Committee for Unemployment Insurance. Among those party organizations represented at this gathering were the Communist Party's Unemployed Councils, its newly established fraternal organization the International Workers Order, and the party's radical trade union organization, the Trade Union Unity League. The gathering determined to launch a petition drive aimed at bringing the signatures of at least 1 million Americans to Congress in an effort to force the adoption of a program of unemployment insurance in the United States. Veteran Communist Party functionary Alfred Wagenknecht was placed in charge of the campaign. On February 10, 1931, the fruits of the NCCUI's efforts, petitions said to contain some 1.4 million signatures, were brought to Washington, DC by a group of 140 of the organization's active supporters, headed by Wagenknecht. The United States Capitol Police were called out in force in anticipation of the arrival of the Communists.

This genetic sequence includes the mecA gene coding for resistance to the antibiotic methicillin and is the only known way for Staphylococcus strains to spread the gene in the wild by horizontal gene transfer. Classification Not all SCCmec elements are identical (in fact, SCC elements without the mecA gene do exist.) SCCmec elements have been classified into twelve types (I through XII) on the basis of two specific regions of their nucleotide sequences. One region is the mec complex including the mecA gene. The other is the ccr gene complex including genes coding for recombinases. The mec complex is divided further into five types (I through V) based on the arrangement of regulatory genetic features such as mecR1, an inducer. Distribution The SCCmec found in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus likely originated in coagulase-negative staphylococcal species and was acquired by S. aureus. Staphylococcal strains isolated from pig farms were found to carry several different types of SCCmec, suggesting that they may serve as a reservoir of these elements.

He was said to be instrumental in the consolidation of power that allowed Chu's first ruler, Ma Yin, to found the Chu state, but was later, in Ma Yin's old age, hated by Ma Yin's son (and eventual successor) Ma Xisheng, who ordered him executed in 929 without prior approval from Ma Yin.  Prior to Chu's founding  It is not known when Gao Yu was born, but it is known that he was from Yang Prefecture (揚州, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. Historical records do not indicate how he became a follower of Ma Yin's, but as Ma, who was then a follower of Sun Ru, had fought under Sun during Sun's attempt to take over Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered at Yang Prefecture),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. Gao might have joined Ma's army then. In any case, by 896, when Ma had just been commissioned the acting military governor of Wu'an Circuit (武安, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan) (which would eventually form the foundation block for the Chu state) by then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong of Tang, Ma employed Gao as his chief strategist. That year, when Ma considered trying to elicit the good will of nearby warlords Cheng Rui the military governor (Jiedushi) of Jingnan Circuit (荊南, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei) and Yang Xingmi the military governor of Huainan (who had prevailed over Sun in the struggle for Huainan), by sending them gifts, Gao pointed out that Cheng lacked actual abilities and needed not be feared, and that given the enmity that had developed between Yang's and Ma's troops (as they had battled during Yang's and Sun's struggle for control of Huainan), any attempt at an alliance would be fruitless. Gao instead emphasized maintaining a good relationship with the imperial government, comforting the people, and training the troops. Ma agreed with these suggestions.  During Chu  Tang Dynasty ended in 907, and the realm was divided between rival states. Ma Yin, who was then full military governor of Wu'an, was a vassal to Tang's main successor state, Later Liang; he was created the Prince of Chu by Later Liang's founding emperor Emperor Taizu, and his state was therefore known as Chu. Gao continued to serve as his chief strategist, and in 908 suggested allowing the people of Chu to sell tea leaves to the north (i.e., Later Liang proper) and collect taxes from the tea trade for military use. Ma agreed. He thus, with approval from Emperor Taizu, established tea trade offices at the Later Liang capital Daliang, as well as at Jing Prefecture (荊州, Jingnan's capital), Xiang Prefecture (襄州, in modern Xiangyang, Hubei), Tang Prefecture (唐州, in modern Zhumadian, Henan), Ying Prefecture (郢州, in modern Jingmen, Hubei), and Fu Prefecture (復州, in modern Tianmen, Hubei). Under this scheme, Chu tea would be shipped to the north and sold; the proceeds would be used to purchase silk and horses, which were lacking in the south. Part of the tea shipment was given to the Later Liang imperial government as tribute. It was said that under this scheme, Chu began to become a wealthy state.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. Meanwhile, Ma encouraged commerce within the Chu state by not taxing commercial transactions. As a result, merchants from everywhere came to Chu to conduct their commerce. In order to take advantage of this phenomenon, Gao, as of 925, suggested to Ma that he mint coins out of two metals not usually used for minting — lead and iron. The Chu money would not be useful in other states, so the merchants were forced to purchase goods within Chu before leaving. This allowed Chu to be able to trade its goods for goods that it lacked, allowing it to become even wealthier.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. Over the years, Ma continued to trust Gao's advice, and the other states despised Gao's abilities. After Later Liang was destroyed by Later Tang in 923, Ma became a vassal of Later Tang,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. and sent his son Ma Xifan to pay tribute to Later Tang's Emperor Zhuangzong. Emperor Zhuangzong, while praising Ma Xifan for his intelligence and alertness, chose to try to sow the seeds of dissension by stating, \\"I had long heard that the Ma state would be seized by Gao Yu. With a son like you, how could Gao steal the state?\\" Gao Jixing, who by 929 was the ruler of a separate state of Jingnan to Chu's north, also tried to create suspicions by spreading rumors against Gao Yu, but Ma Yin paid no heed to these rumors. Gao Jixing then sent a letter to Ma's second eldest son Ma Xisheng, whom Ma Yin had by that point put in control of most affairs of the Chu state, ostensibly to seek permission to allow him to enter into a blood brotherhood with Gao Yu. Ma Xisheng's suspicions were aroused, particularly since his wife's relative Yang Zhaosui () had ambitions of replacing Gao Yu, and therefore often spoke negatively of Gao Yu to him. Ma Xisheng thus accused Gao Yu of wasteful living and contacting other states, requesting Ma Yin to kill him. Ma Yin refused, but after Ma Xisheng repeatedly requested to at least strip Gao Yu of military command, did so. Gao Yu, displeased, stated to his associates, \\"I am going to build a mansion in the hills to the west, for retirement. The pony [(a double entendre, as Ma means \\"horse\\" in Chinese)] has grown up and can bite now.\\" Ma Xisheng heard the remark and became angry — so angry that he falsely announced that Gao had committed treason, and he slaughtered Gao and his family, without first informing Ma Yin. When Ma Yin heard this, he cried bitterly, but did not punish Ma Xisheng.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276.

The agency's primary function is to assist the Minister-President in coordinating the activities of the Bavarian State Government, similar to the German Chancellery on federal level. The State Chancellery is represented by Bavarian missions in the German capital Berlin and to the European Union in Brussels. The building Bayerische Staatskanzlei is also the name of the building in Munich that houses the personal offices of the chancellery staff. It was erected from 1989 to 1993 around the central dome of the former Bavarian Army Museum, which had been built in 1905 at the site of the Hofgartenkaserne barracks and was demolished in World War II. The museum then was moved to the New Castle in Ingolstadt. With reference to Leo von Klenze's neighbouring Festsaalbau of the Munich Residenz, the new building of the Bavarian Army Museum was also influenced by the Italian High Renaissance architecture, but shows the monumentalization of the late Historicism. The architect was Ludwig Mellinger. The west side of the central building with six columns completes a three-part entablature with limestone figures in the center and four trophies. The east facade, originally facing no road, was made comparatively restrained. Under the dome was a central room, a \\"Hall of Fame\\". This space takes the two upper floors with a height of 32 meters. After its destruction in World War II, the two side wings were torn off, the central building was for a ruin for decades. By 1982, however, the dome with its copper coverage was restored. The remnants of some Renaissance arcades of the Hofgarten in the north were integrated to the building. The two new wings are covered in full length with glazed stairs in the style of Jacob's Ladders, giving the impression of ship stairs. At the request of then-Prime Minister Max Streibl an intimate space with wood paneling and furnishings, (\\"Zirbelstube\\") was inserted after the reception room of the Prime Minister, who caused a stir because of high costs. The building comprises about 8,800 m². To the east of the building the stream Köglmühlbach flows past above ground.

The building was built in 1888/89 by architect Friedrich von Thiersch with a neo-baroque style façade designed by his apprentice Martin Dülfer, making the building one of the first of its kind and later the most influential for all other buildings of its type in Munich. The building is protected as cultural heritage.  History  Bernheimer-Haus, before 1895 The Lenbachplatz is located on the abandoned western Munich city fortifications. It is located north of Stachus and goes northeast into the Maximiliansplatz. The western side is the location of three spacious and stylistically coherent structures from the period between 1887 and 1905. The Bernheimer Palace was the first of them to be built. As the surrounding area became more appealing, the original two neighboring buildings were torn down and replaced with new buildings in the style of the Bernheimer Palace. In 1864, Lehmann Bernheimer founded a business for high-quality textiles in Munich’s old town and expanded his business with the manufacture of luxury goods for the living area. In 1882, he became the provider of goods to the Bavarian royal family, which allowed him to take over the old building located in the Altstadt, which still held its medieval floor plans, and planned to turn it into a representative of new architecture. In 1887, he bought a small coffee house with a beer garden, which was owned and run by an Englishman, therefore called the English Café. This stretched between Ottostraße and Lenbachplatz, where the building was set back from the Ottostraße. The beer garden covered the full width of the property from Lenbachplatz, and this is where the Bernheimer’s commercial building was built. Bernheimer was well integrated in the highest circles of Munich society, and because of this, the grand opening of his office building was made in December 1889 by Prince Regent Luitpold. In February 1897, a fire broke out in the basement, where the inventory and portions of the building were severely damaged. The building could be reopened at the time of Pentecost in 1897. When the building was being repaired, the coffee house was integrated. Starting in 1900, Bernheimer added antiques, tapestry, and valuable carpets to the assortment. As the business grew, the existing premises were insufficient, and in 1909/10, Bernheimer-Haus was completed with the construction of a rearward building. In 1918, Lehmann Bernheimer's son, Otto Bernheimer, took over the business. During the Nazi dictatorship, the company was initially protected because Otto Bernheimer was an Honorary Consul of Mexico. In 1938/39, after destruction and threats during the November Pogrom, the company was aryanized, and the Bernheimer family was initially detained in Dachau and then forced into exile. State in 1962, with a simplified roof During the Second World War, the building was damaged, including the roof with the spire caving in. After the war, Otto Bernheimer, who had returned from Venezuela in 1946, received Bernheimer-Haus again as Wiedergutmachung. He restored the roof by building it in a simplified form. On the main floor, a movie theater was built, which later became the local dance hall. In 1948, Otto Bernheimer started with the art trade. In 1977, Otto Bernheimer's grandson, Konrad Bernheimer, took over. The company was specializing in Old Master paintings from the 16th to 19th centuries, and it was then renamed as Bernheimer Fine Old Masters. In 1987, Konrad Berheimer sold the building in order to pay his co-heirs and to be able to finance his gallery. The building was purchased by real estate broker Jürgen Schneider, who commissioned architect Alexander von Branca to modernize and remodel the inside, as well as start the extremely complicated restoration of the historically protected exterior. In 1993, when Schneider's real estate empire collapsed because of massive fraud, Deutsche Bank took over as the main creditor for the Bernheimer Palace and allowed the completion of the renovations. The cost of reconstruction is estimated at well over DM 100 million, which included DM 32 million in unpaid manufacturers’ bills from Jürgen Schneider's bankruptcy. The reconstruction of the roof and spire has been identified as the main cause. It was not until 1999 that Deutsche Bank could resell the building to Robert Arnold, the heir and former partner of Arnold & Richter Cine Technik.

In the north of Munich, it is part of the Bundesstraße 304.  Route  The Dachauer Straße begins today as a track- leading street of the tram lines 20 and 21 north of the Bahnhofplatz in the district of Maxvorstadt. Until 1877, the southern part of today's Dachauer Sraße to the height of Marsstraße was still part of the Schützenstraße. From Hirtenstraße, the Dachauer Straße then also serves for use by motor vehicle traffic, until Elisenstraße, as a one-lane One-way traffic and then carries on to the Stiglmaierplatz with two opposing lanes. From Stiglmaierplatz, the street picks up the multi-lane traffic coming from the south to Seidlstraße, where it mostly has two lanes through Neuhausen-Nymphenburg, to which it then crosses Leonrodplatz and leads to the height of the Olympic Park under the Landshuter Allee (Mittlerer Ring) through to the district of Moosach. There it crosses at the junction of Wintrich- with the Georg-Brauchle-Ring, at the intersection it once again like the Baubergerstraße and the Pelkovenstraße, continues on with single lanes on both sides and a little further north in Feldmoching-Hasenbergl after a bend below the track of the DB marshalling yard in a western direction, continues as a multi-lane road part of the national road 304. In this bend, the Max-Born-Straße from the East ends here and forms the further course of the national road 304. The Dachauer Straße then leads in a northwesterly direction over the railway tracks and the A 99 to the city or county boundary, where it continues in Karlsfeld under the name Münchner Straße. The northern route of the Dachauer Straße has been changed over time. In the former village Moosach, the old Dachauer Straße ran, since the middle of the 12th century, on the route of the today's Darmstädter, Batzenhofer and Quedlinburger Straße and received there direct route starting in the middle of the 18th century. Due to the construction of the marshalling yard Munich North between 1987 and 1991, the road was routed over the tracks again another 400m to the west.

In the Middle Ages, around 1660, the part of the street close to the city bore the name Mosserstraße, derived from \\"Mossach\\", since it led from Munich to Moosach. The structural development of the area more remote from the old town began with the construction of several barracks of the Bavarian Army with its associated infrastructure. Therefore, the then rural environment of Neuhausen was redesigned from the mid-19th century, which brought the district south of the practice area Oberwiesenfeld and north of the parade grounds Marsfeld the name \\"barracks district\\" and significantly accelerated the structural change Neuhausens. From 1866, extensive workshops of the royal armory were built along the Dachauer Straße; at times, more than 1,000 workers were employed there. The last still existent military-related institution is the Bundeswehrverwaltungszentrum München (Army Administrative Center Munich). It is located on the site of the former Eisenbahnkaserne (railway barracks) number 128. In 1869, Adele Spitzeder founded her private bank in Dachauer Straße, which became known as Dachauer Banken. On 21 October 1876, the first Munich horse tram passed on its route from Promenadeplatz to Nymphenburger Straße/Burgfriedensgrenze (Maillingerstraße) the Dachauer Straße between Bahnhofplatz and Stiglmaierplatz. In 1898, the west bordering cemetery was built. In 1900 the tram route from 1876 was made electric. On the western side opposite the Bundeswehrverwaltungszentrum München (Army Administrative Center Munich), the Association for the Improvement of Housing in Munich built a small residential complex in the Ebenau district even before the First World War, which was used as one of the early examples of non-profit housing construction in Munich. In 1905, the current Heinz Naumann House (number 25) was built by Michael Reifenstuel, which then served as a posthospital. After the former gas works on the Thalkirchner road and the Kirchstein (now Vogelweideplatz) could not keep up with the growing gas demand of the city, the construction of the gas works Moosach, now number 148, began in 1906. On 25 July 1909, the new tram connection from Stiglmaier to Leonrodplatz was first used. In the restaurant \\"Zum Deutschen Reich\\", located on Dachauer Straße, the German Workers' Party organized meetings in 1919 and 1920, with Adolf Hitler as speaker. Between 1924 and 1929, the Borstei was built north of the Middle Ring. In 1928, depot 5 for trams was completed in the Dachauer Straße 104, which was put back into service in 1949 after the damages from the war were repaired and then shut down in 1977. After request of the realm aviation ministry from 1936, development too place on the current factory premises of MTU Aero Engines (Dachauer Straße 665) and MAN commercial vehicles (Dachauer Straße 667) another BMW factory, which produced the 801 engine starting in 1942. During the period of National Socialism, innumerable so-called protective prisoners were deported via the Dachauer Straße to the Dachau concentration camp. After a bomb attack by the Allies in 1943, the gas plant was severely damaged. The ordered demolition of the plant was prevented by the factory management. After the war, the plant had to be shut down for half a year because of the damages caused by the war. After the conversion of the gas supply to Roherd gas took place on 10 November 1975, the plant was closed. In 2008, sections of the tram tracks in Dachauer Straße were renewed. The that poststall of the city was also located on the street. The former post office on Dachauer Straße was built by Franz Holzhammer. In addition, Dachauer Straße 90 is home to the Municipal Health Department and the blood doner service of the Städtische Klinikum München GmbH. In the former buildings of the police driving school, the department city center of the Munich Fire Department is temporarily accommodated there for some years.

Educational institutions  In 1951, an elementary school was built on the Dachauer Straße for the children of the Ludwigsfelder camp, and in 1963, at number 98, a primary school was built. In addition, the Munich Educational Plant is located at Dachauer Straße 5 and the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Vehicle Technology and Aircraft Engineering at the University of Applied Sciences Munich at Dachauer Straße 98b.  Culture  In the area of gastronomy, located next to the Löwenbräukeller at the intersecting Stiglmaierplatz is one of the oldest guest houses in Munich called \\"Alter Wirt\\" in Moosach, which was first documented in 1442 as a Täfernhaus. In 1906, Carl Gabriel had the first Lichtspielhaus (Movie theater) in Munich built on Dachauer Straße under the name \\"The American Bio.-Cie.\\", which still exists today after several renovations under the name of Gabriel Filmtheater. Even after the First World War, the Apollo Theater (house numbers 19/21) is located opposite the confluence of Augustenstraße. The actor Karl Valentin performed on stage at the \\"Baderwirt\\" under the name \\"Skeleton Giggerl\\". Since the early 1980s, the Munich Theater for children, which was previously housed on the Leopoldstraße, is located in the building of the former Regina- Lichtspielhauses at Dachauer Straße 46 and in 1982, the Pathos Transport Theater was founded on Dachauer Straße 110 d. In the 1980s, parts of the abandoned military properties in Dachauer Straße 128, which now houses a housing estate and the headquarters of the Goethe-Institut, were used for theater and event purposes. Where the artillery workshops were before the Second World War, was until the renovations were completed on the main building, a theater of the Munich Kammerspiele in a converted industrial hall of Stadtwerke München which was classified as a demolition object and only provisionally kept intact. From the spring of 2003 until the beginning of 2010, the event technology of the cultural department and the rooms of the Academy of Fine Arts were housed in the same property on Dachauer Straße 114. There today is the Schwere Reiter Theater.  Trivia  * During the time of National Socialism, Karl Valentin asked the ironic question of what was probably the longest street and answered it with \\"The Dachauer Straße, of course, since many go out and hardly anyone comes back - from the concentration camp\\". right * At the corner of Lampadiusstraße is still an original street sign with the name written in German type.

Ceramics and glass are focal areas, as are Jewelry and Appliances, not to mention selected objects in the field of crafted design. History Founded in 1907 in line with the ideas of the German Werkbund, it was inaugurated as an official state museum in 1925. From the very beginning it distinguished itself from the museums of arts and crafts of the day by committing firmly to espousing the Modernism of the times and thus contemporary design. To this day, the Neue Sammlung’s agenda pursue those initial objectives.

Already for the first Hofbrunnwerk, erected in 1562, a canal had been laid, which presumably branched off from the Weststadtgrabenbach. The canal with its present course was built around 1845, when the old Brunnwerk was demolished at the Residenz and rebuilt next to the Hofbrunnwerk. In 1968, the Hofbrunnwerkkanal was abandoned as it stood in the way of the construction of the Altstadtring, and the Hofbrunnwerk was closed down. As part of the reconstruction of the old Bavarian State Chancellery, where the Köglmühlbach was rebuilt next to its original bed, the Hofbrunnwerkkanal and the Hofbrunnwerk were restored in Operation.

History  Historical view of the department store that was designed by Max Littmann and Hermann Tietz at the Munich Bahnhofvorplatz 7, postcard from 1909 The traditional, historically protected department store was built between 1904 and 1905 according to designs by the Munich architect Max Littmann for the department store chain Hermann Tietz, opposite the Hauptbahnhof, and opened on 14 March 1905. In the design of the building, Littmann used elements of the German Renaissance, following the historicizing taste of the time. The former department store Tietz is a five- storey hipped roof construction with protrusions, stair towers, gables and dormers. It was built in a skeletal steel construction with reduced historicizing façade structures, partly with muschelkalk. The sculptural façade decoration is by Julius Seidler, Jakob Bradl and Fidel Enderle. Already around 1930 the two opposing escalators in the large Lichthof were worked to reflect the city's flair. After damage to the façades as a result of World War II, the building was rebuilt in a simplified manner and then substantially extended. The vast expansion from the year 1971 comes from the renowned architect Fred Angerer. With almost 40,000 square meters of sales space, a 220-meter-long façade along Schützenstraße and an underground car park for 500 cars, the building complex is one of the largest department stores in Germany. The building belonged to Hertie and was remained as such after the takeover of the company, especially since the Karstadt-Haus Oberpollinger is nearby. After the newly founded company Hertie GmbH (formerly Karstadt Kompakt) revived the name \\"Hertie\\" on 1 March 2007, the house belonging to Karstadt Warenhaus GmbH had to be renamed \\"Karstadt München Bahnhofplatz\\". The renaming took place step by step until the complete change of name took place on 27 September, 2007. The six-storey building is one of the most coveted large-scale properties in Munich's city center. In 2015, the German-Irish investment company Signature Capital acquired the property in a bidding contest. After a year and a half, it was sold in August 2016 to the real estate company RFR Holding, led by the two German-born property investors Aby Rosen and Michael Fuchs. The market value rose by almost 40 percent. At the beginning of October 2016 it became known that the real estate Signa Holding, founded by René Benko, took part in the extensive department store complex through a 50:50 joint venture.

Location  The Luisengymnasium is located in the Maxvorstadt district of Munich near the main train station at Luisenstraße 7. The school is centrally located on the Old Botanical Garden in the immediate vicinity of Stachus and Königsplatz.  History  Founded in 1822 as the \\"School for Higher Daughters\\" and co-educational since 1969, it is Munich's oldest municipal high school and one of the few schools with its own school constitution. The Luisengymnasium is named after Princess Ludovika Wilhelmine of Bavaria, who later became Duchess Luise. She was the daughter of Maximilian I. Joseph (Bavaria) and mother of the legendary Sisi. She was very influential and enjoyed tremendous prestige. In 1812, Gartenstrasse, which was then on the outskirts of the city, was renamed Luisenstrasse in her honor. The school was founded by Simon Spitzweg, the father of the famous painter Carl Spitzweg. In 1901 the students moved into the school house planned by Theodor Fischer. Peace activist Marie Zehetmaier was one of the first women to get a job as a physics and math teacher. From 1905 she taught at the Luisengymnasium. When the \\"School for Higher Daughters\\" moved to the newly built Theodor Fischer Building in 1901, the Munich school called it the Luis School. In 1961, the already common name was also given a formal name, and from then on the school could call itself the Municipal Luisengymnasium. After the destruction of the Second World War made a four-year evacuation necessary, the students moved back to the renovated building in 1949. In 1952 the Maria Heldrich Landheim was established in Pöcking on Lake Starnberg . In 1969 co-education was introduced. In 1987, after three years of construction, the clinker brick construction was completed and the general renovation of the old building started. In 1990 the relocation to the newly designed old building began. The Luisengymnasium has been an all-day high school since 2005. The new cafeteria was inaugurated on April 21, 2009.http://www.baunetz.de/meldungen/Meldungen- Muenchener_Gymnasium_umgebaut_763334.html The Luisengymnasium, like all of Bavaria's grammar schools, has switched from the G9 to the G8 .

It is not to be confused with the Nordfriedhof in Munich, which was set up only a short time later in Schwabing. Construction began in 1866 to designs by the city architect Arnold Zenetti.  History  Until the middle of the 19th century the city of Munich had only a single public burial ground, the present Alter Südfriedhof. This was growing too small however for the rapidly growing city, and planning therefore began for a new burial ground in the north of the city. Between June 1866 and the summer of 1869 the Northern Cemetery (\\"Nördlicher Friedhof\\") was built in Maxvorstadt. The planning process itself reflected the split in society regarding cemeteries and public buildings generally: on the one hand there was a general wish to have the most prominent grave site possible, but on the other hand an equally general feeling that the cemetery should not be at one's own front door. Despite all controversies the Alter Nördlicher Friedhof opened on 5 October 1868, and the first burial took place the same day, when the remains of the former minister of St. Ludwig's, Munich, were transferred to the new burial ground. The cemetery itself, rectangular in shape, with the chapel and various service buildings annexed, was originally divided into 16 fields of equal size. Along the west wall 30 arcaded vaults were built; a large cross stands in the middle. In its geometrical ground-plan and to some extent the arcades along the wall it resembled the idea of the Campo Santo, at the time a popular style of burial ground in Germany. With the rise to power of the National Socialists in 1933 the entire existence of the cemetery was thrown into doubt: the new regime, in the context of the re-building of Munich as the capital of the movement, wanted to connect Isabellastraße with Luisenstraße in order to construct a spectacular boulevard, which was obstructed by the Alter Nördlicher Friedhof. For this reason burials ceased in 1939. Up to 1944 there were still single burials in existing family graves. After that time the cemetery was badly affected by air raids and was closed altogether. Many of the arcade vaults and most of the other cemetery buildings were destroyed. After the war it was decided not to reopen the cemetery. For one thing, most of the graves were full. For another, there was enough capacity in the large cemeteries opened at the beginning of the 20th century under Hans Grässel to be able to do without this rather small one. Many graves were subsequently cleared: of the total capacity of 7,272 burial places only about 700 were kept. From 1868 to 1944/45 about 62,000 people were buried there. Half the arcades were not rebuilt after the war. On the site of the chapel a playground now stands, separated from the rest of the cemetery. The present appearance is due to the architect Hans Döllgast.  Present day  Recreational use The Alter Nördlicher Friedhof, with its light planting of trees, today represents a significant green space in the Maxvorstadt district and is used as a small park, with due respect for those long since buried here. Many benches have been installed. On fine days the grass between the ivy-covered gravestones is popular for sun-bathing.

Built in the early 19th century to a design by Leo von Klenze and forming a counterpoint to the externally identical Palais Leuchtenberg, it was rebuilt after being almost totally destroyed in World War II and now houses the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior. History The Odeon was built in 1826-1828 on a commission from King Ludwig I of Bavaria and was originally a concert hall and ballroom. Klenze designed the exterior as an identical counterpart to that of the Palais Leuchtenberg, so that there was no outward indication of its function.Geschichte des Odeons: von Leo von Klenze bis heute , Bavarian Ministry of the Interior , with historical photographs and plan. The auditorium, which measured and seated 1,445, had two superimposed colonnades which provided access on the ground floor and a gallery with standing room, and a ceiling high with a skylight.Hermann Alexander von Berlepsch, Munich: Its Art-treasures and Curiosities; Supplement to Every Travelling Guide, Munich, 1871, , p. 45. The orchestra was accommodated in a semi-circular exedra, behind which in niches were busts by Johannes Leeb of the ten composers then considered most important in the history of music: Beethoven, Mozart, Gluck, Handel, Haydn, Vogler, Méhul, Weber, Cimarosa and Winter. The ceiling was decorated with frescoes in the Nazarene style: Apollo among the Muses by Wilhelm Kaulbach, Apollo among the Herdsmen by Adam Eberle and The Judgement of Midas by Hermann Anschütz.J.

Beginning in 1951, it was rebuilt by Josef Wiedemann to house the Ministry of the Interior. Recreation of the façade took until 1954. The former auditorium became an interior courtyard. Numerous lovers of music and architecture asked for it to be restored as a concert space, but this was not technically or financially feasible. The preservationist and architect Erwin Schleich campaigned for it to be recreated on the site of the Palais Leuchtenberg, also destroyed in the war, but despite widespread support organised by the Arbeitskreis Odeon (Odeon Working Group) formed by Schleich in 1960, that plan was also rejected. It pitted preservationists who argued that such a recreation would be a \\"forgery\\" against those like Schleich who valued \\"social utility\\" over authenticity.Gavriel David Rosenfeld,Munich and Memory: Architecture, Monuments, and the Legacy of the Third Reich, Weimar and now 22, Berkeley: University of California, 2000, , pp. 189-92.

It starts in the city centre at Stiglmaierplatz, leads through five districts and ends at Goldschmiedplatz. It takes its name from the northern suburb of Oberschleißheim, where it originally ended.  Course  The Schleißheimer Straße starts as a one-lane one-way street in the center of Maxvorstadt district as a branch of the Dachauer Straße a little north of the Stiglmaierplatz, leads past the Maßmannpark and runs almost straight from south to north through Schwabing, Am Riesenfeld, Milbertshofen, Lerchenau and Harthof to the district Hasenbergl. From the city centre to the height of Moosacher Straße / Frankfurter Ring, the road is mostly one-lane, with the exception of a section in front of Petuelring. Afterwards it leads continuously as two lanes up to its end at the Goldschmiedplatz / corner Aschenbrennerstraße. An extension to the north up to the A99 is being planned. Because of the adjacent residential areas, the Rathaus-SPD is also bringing a 2.5 km long tunnel into discussion, which could run north from the height of Rathenaustraße. A special feature of Schleißheimer Straße is the fact that you can see the towers of Munich's Frauenkirche almost along their entire length up to and including the end in Hasenbergl. At the Schleißheimer Str. 142 in Schwabing there is the Nordbad in the district Milbertshofen at the Schleißheimer Str. 281 a bunker, the Kulturhaus Milbertshofen at the Curt- Mezger-Platz. At Schleißheimer Straße 387A there is the canal operating station of Stadtentwässerung München (city drainage), in Lerchenau at Schleißheimer Straße 393 the Virginia biotope, at Schleißheimer Straße 424 the research and innovation centre of the automobile manufacturer BMW, at Schleißheimer Straße 506 the Mira shopping centre, at Schleißheimer Straße 510 the school centre Nordhaide, the Goldschmiedplatz and finally the Panzerwiese.

Since the 14th century it was called Rennweg/Reitweg (riding trail). From the 17th century onwards, Schleißheimer Straße connected Munich with the summer residence of the Bavarian rulers in Schleissheim Palace. With the construction of the Oberschleißheim airfield in 1912, the road crossed the airfield and was permanently interrupted in 1917 after several near attacks. The Powder Tower was a well-known former meeting place of the Dark culture. It was closed on 1 January 2007 and has since been demolished. Between Nordbad and Petuelring, is the line 27 of the Munich tram, which runs on a section of the line 7 between Görresstraße and Petuelring, which was stopped in 1980 with the opening of the underground line U2. Until 1993, tram line 13 also ran on the section between Rathenaustraße and its end in Hasenbergl. This line was closed on 21 November 1993 as it was replaced by the underground line U2, which mostly ran parallel. The former Hasenbergl terminal was converted into a sport and play area. Adolf Hitler lived in a room at Schleißheimer Straße 34 from May 1913 until he joined the Bavarian Army in August 1914.

Procera sells solutions to telecom operators, governments, enterprises, and network equipment vendors in the areas of Analytics, Traffic Management, Policy and Charging Control, and Service Provider Compliance. History Procera was incorporated in 2002 in California. The company was initially created to deliver intelligent Ethernet network switches. The company changed its product line when it merged with Netintact, a company based in Varberg, Sweden, that offered bandwidth management products to Scandinavian network operators under the PacketLogic brand. The merger was announced in May and closed in June 2006. Procera shifted the company product strategy to the Netintact product lines. From 2006 to 2008, Procera sold inexpensive (less than 2 Gbit/s) traffic management products to small operators and enterprises, to operators like Com Hem in Sweden. In September 2007, Procera Networks became listed on the American Stock Exchange with stock symbol PKT. Beginning in 2008, Procera began focusing on larger carriers and mobile operators. Several customers reported they use Procera's technology, such as Yoigo and Genband, which resells Procera products as its P-Series products. Procera was named one of the fastest growing network companies by Deloitte for 2010 and 2011 as part of its Deloitte Fast 500 study. On June 24, 2011, Procera Networks joined the Russell 3000 Index. In December 2011, Procera moved to the NASDAQ stock exchange using the symbol PKT. In 2013, Procera bought Vineyard Networks, a Canadian DPI company for C$28 million. The Vineyard product is sold on the market as Network Application Visibility Library (NAVL) to network equipment vendors. In 2015, Procera was acquired by Francisco Partners, a private equity firm based in San Francisco Procera now operates as a private company and is no longer listed on NASDAQ. In 2017, Francisco Partners acquired Sandvine and merged it with Procera.  Technology  Procera offers Network Intelligence solutions based on their version of deep packet inspection (DPI) called the Datastream Recognition Definition Language (DRDL). DRDL uses properties of applications for identification purposes, and this allows operators to manage subscriber traffic based on the application, similar to many DPI products. Procera offers over 100 use cases in Analytics, Traffic Management, Policy Enforcement, and Service Provider Compliance.  Controversy  In October 2016 it was alleged that Procera had sold its DPI software to the government of Turkey via the telecoms company Turk Telecom in order to reveal the usernames and passwords of people visiting unencrypted websites. According to Forbes, there was significant internal opposition from technologists working for Procera to the sale. Current and former employees are said to have told Forbes that 'Turk Telekom requested not just a feed of subscribers’ usernames and passwords for unencrypted websites, but also their IP addresses, what sites they’d visited and when.' In August 2020 it was alleged Procera had sold its DPI software to the government of Belarus via the Belarus’s National Traffic Exchange Center. The Procera technology was allegedly used for government-ordered internet censorship and shutdown in Belarus during 2020 Belarusian protests.

Laguna Beach artists and books While residing in Laguna Beach, California, Foster owned and operated an advertising agency, where he worked with many local artists and illustrators. Through his friends in the art community, he discovered many artists who wanted to teach art and write books. In response, Foster started a publishing company in his home, where he wrote, illustrated, printed, bound, packaged, shipped and distributed the books himself. An artist in his own right, Foster created the company’s first title, How to Draw, which sold more than one million copies and is still in print today. Foster died in 1981 at the age of 90, at which time his family took over company operations. One of Foster's most notable artists was Preston Blair, whose book, Animation, sold more than one million copies and is still in print today. Another noteworthy artist, Hal Rasmusson (Aggie Mack), wrote Modern Cartoon. Roger Armstrong (Ella Cinders, Napoleon and Uncle Elby) was the author of How to Draw Comic Strips (1990). Walter Foster Publishing In 1988, a group of investors comprising Andrew McNally IV (former president of Rand McNally), Illinois businessman Rhett Butler, attorney Paul Hegness and California businessman and former Price Waterhouse CPA Ross Sarracino purchased the Walter Foster Publishing Company. With Sarracino at the helm, the company began developing instructional drawing and painting books for children. The popularity of these children’s books eventually led to licensing agreements with The Walt Disney Company, Nickelodeon, Hasbro, Marvel Entertainment, DC Comics and Warner Bros.. Walter Foster Publishing's Walt Disney books and activity kits have sold more than 4,500,000 copies since 1991. In 1996, Quarto Publishing, under direction of CEO Laurence Orbach, acquired Walter Foster Publishing, leaving Sarracino at the helm as President and CEO. In addition to growing its publishing and custom packaging (creating books and kits for Baker & Taylor, Barnes & Noble, Chronicle Books, Disney Press, Michaels, Scholastic, TJ Maxx and Target) business, Foster teamed with MEDL Mobile to create the Learn to Draw Digital Sketchbook app for the iPad.

It is found in the Mediterranean Sea from low tide mark to a depth of . Description left The shell of Arca noae grows to about 10 cm (4 in) in length. It is shortened at the anterior end and elongated posteriorly. It is irregularly striped in brown and white and has fine sculptured ribs running from the umbones to the margin. The hinge is long and straight and the shell is attached strongly to the substrate by byssal threads. There are pallial eyes on the edges of the mantle, especially at the posterior end. Distribution Arca noae is found in the Mediterranean Sea. It was once common in the Adriatic, but in 1949/50 there was a sudden unexplained, catastrophic decline in numbers. Since then, populations have been creeping back upwards, and in 2002, densities of up to 13 individuals per square metre (11 square feet) were recorded. However, due to a lack of records, it is unclear whether the population had returned to its previous size. Biology In the lower part of the intertidal zone in the Adriatic, Arca noae often grows in association with Modiolus barbatus. The shells are often heavily encrusted with epibionts. Water is drawn into the shell mainly at the posterior end. Plankton and fine organic particles are filtered out as the water passes over the gills and inedible particles are rejected at the same time. Uses Arca noae is fished commercially in the Adriatic Sea, either by divers gathering individual shells by hand or from boats using specially adapted rakes which are pulled along the seabed. The shellfish are then sold in local markets.

It begins in Palm Springs, California, and ascends to San Jacinto Peak. With a net elevation gain of roughly , it has one of the greatest elevation increases among day-hike routes in the United States. The elevation gain happens in only , also making it one of the steeper trails of its length in the world.Harris, David Money and Harris, Jennifer Money, Afoot and Afield Inland Empire, Wilderness Press, 2009, pp. 231–233. The trail runs roughly parallel to the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, and the upper part of the trail runs very close to the Mountain station of the tramway. The initial part of the route is called the Skyline Trail, which climbs 7,900 feet from the desert to Long Valley, in about 11 miles. There, it joins another system of trails, where hikers may gain another 2,400 feet (over 5 miles) to the summit. The route from the desert to the peak and back to the desert is about 32 miles long. A common way to tackle the hike is to walk the way up to the peak from the valley, then head back to the tram station, and then take the tram back down to the valley floor. Separate records are kept for the climb of Skyline Trail (first 11 miles), for C2C (16 miles one way from the museum to the peak, Cactus to Clouds), and for C2C2C (valley floor to the peak, and back to floor). A hike up this route typically starts behind the Palm Springs Art Museum. The Skyline Trail starts along a path known as the Museum Trail, continues to a junction with the North Lykken Trail, before becoming an informal trail, not maintained by government agencies. At its end, it joins the Desert View Nature Trail in Mount San Jacinto State Park. The Skyline Trail ends at Long Valley at the end of the Nature Trail. At the end of Skyline, there is a ranger station where it is sometimes possible to obtain potable water. From here, the route continues to a trail junction called Wellman Divide, before reaching the summit of San Jacinto Peak. There is a nearby cross-country mountaineering route to San Jacinto Peak, called the Snow Creek route. The approach rises even more dramatically than C2C, gaining 11,000 feet in just 7 miles.  History  Ray Wilson and Sue Birnbaum, former Coachella Valley Hiking Club hike leaders conceived the idea for the Cactus to Clouds hike in 1991, after marking, with yellow metal tags, the final miles of the faint Skyline Trail as it terminated at Long Valley near the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway Mountain Station. The following year, starting on the North Lykken Trail, they hiked the Skyline Trail and the San Jacinto Peak Trail to the summit of San Jacinto Peak, a 10,300-foot gain. They decided to offer the hike through the Coachella Valley Hiking Club and subsequently led the first Cactus to Clouds Challenge in 1993, along with 4 other club members. Roger Keezer, a Coachella Valley Hiking Club hike leader and one of the original Cactus to Clouds Challenge hikers, created the phrase “Cactus to Clouds” when the group was considering names for the event. Route The trail begins at around elevation near the Palm Springs Art Museum. The first part of the trail is maintained by government agencies, and consists of the Museum and North Lykken Trails. After reaching a set of picnic tables 0.8 miles in, the trail turns into an informal path maintained by hikers and volunteers. One may find two rescue boxes along this section. Although the route is generally obvious, there are number of shortcuts and spurs which may confuse hikers and thus pose a danger to the uninitiated. Continuing out of the hills above Palm Springs, the trail ascends the east side of Mount San Jacinto along a ridge between Chino Canyon and Tahquitz Creek, going roughly westward along the ridgeline. There is a short northward turn at , a difficult part for winter ascents known as \\"The Traverse\\". In Long Valley, hikers usually take a break at the tramway facilities at . Many descend via the tramway at this point. The remainder of the route follows a well-maintained state park trail to the summit of San Jacinto Peak, passing a popular trail junction known as Wellman Divide along the way. From the peak, the vast majority of hikers walk down to the tram station and take the tram down. Many, though only a tiny minority of C2C hikers, decide to walk down all the way back to the Museum. Hazards The primary hazard of Cactus to Clouds is the weather, in particular, the extreme variance between the desert start and the subalpine end. Temperatures in the lower portions of the trail can reach up to , while temperatures of are not uncommon at the summit of Mount San Jacinto in the winter. For these reasons, the hike usually begins in Palm Springs very early in the morning, as early as midnight. The hike is typically done in Fall or Spring, with May and October being the best months.

He received his preliminary education in Hindi and Sanskrit in the local school. He went on to study advanced Sanskrit and Ayurved in Ashtang Ayurved College, Lokmanya Nagar, Indore and Varanasi and spent a year or more around Chitrakoot. After completing his formal education, at the age of 16, he entered into self- imposed vanvas. He found his way to Vrindavan and the next year he emerged as a Guru, known affectionately as Shri Maharaj Ji. When he was 17 years old, he led a 6-month continuous chanting of the \\"Maha Mantra\\".

Kripalu was invited to give discourse at the Kashi Vidvat Parishat in 1957. The congregation had scholars from Varanasi and other parts of India. His speeches lasted for seven days, after which he was formally installed as the fifth Jagadguru (\\"world teacher\\").

After being awarded Jagadguruttam (the foremost among Jagadgurus), he spent most of the initial years in Agra. Prem Ras Sidhhant and Prem Ras Madira were also written during that phase of His life, which extends from late 1950s to 1970s.

It is monoclinic, but no space group has been determined because no single-crystal study has been done. Paulscherrerite occurs as a canary yellow microcrystalline powdery product with a length of ~500 nm. It forms by the weathering and ultimate pseudomorphism of uranium-lead bearing minerals such as metaschoepite. The type locality for paulscherrerite is the Number 2 Workings, Radium Ridge near Mount Painter, North Flinders Ranges, South Australia, an area where radiogenic heat has driven hydrothermal activity for millions of years. It is named for Swiss physicist Paul Scherrer, co-inventor of the Debye-Scherrer X-ray powder diffraction camera. Study of paulscherrerite and related minerals is important for understanding the mobility of uranium around mining sites, as well as designing successful strategies for the storage of nuclear weapons and the containment of nuclear waste. Introduction The schoepite subgroup of the fourmarierite group: schoepite, metaschoepite, paraschoepite, and “dehydrated schoepite”, are closely related hexavalent uranium (uranyl) oxide hydrates/hydroxides.Burns, P.C. (1999) The crystal chemistry of uranium. In P.C. Burns and R. Finch. Eds., Uranium: Mineralogy, geochemistry, and the environment, vol.38, 23-90. Reviews in Mineralogy, Mineralogical Society of America, Chantilly, Virginia. Schoepite was first described by T. L. Walker in 1923 and the determination of the relationship between the various subgroups has since been ongoing. Detailed X-ray powder diffraction and single crystal studies have led to a better understanding of the natural dehydration process of schoepite that result in the rest of the subgroup.Finch, R.J., Hawthorne, F.C., Miller, M.L., and Ewing, R.C. (1997) Distinguishing among schoepite, (UO2)8O2(OH)12 · 12H2O and related minerals by X-ray powder diffraction. Powder Diffraction, 12, 230-238. “Dehydrated schoepite” has now been formally described as a mineral species by a team of geologists led by Joel Brugger of the University of Adelaide, Australia and given the name paulscherrerite, with the formula UO3 · 1.02H2O. Composition The empirical formula for paulscherrerite is UO3 · 1.02H2O. The formulas for the rest of the schoepite group are: schoepite (UO2)8O2(OH)12 · 12H2O and metaschoepite UO3 · 1-2H2O. Electron microprobe 20 point analyses showed that it is an almost pure uranyl oxide-hydroxide/hydrate, with less than ~1 wt% of minor elements such as Al, Ba, and Pb. The simplified structural formula is UO2(OH)2, which requires the presence of water: UO3 93.96, H2O 6.04, Total 100.00 wt%. Table 1 shows an analysis of the chemical composition. Because paulscherrerite always exists in powder form, mixed with substantial amounts of metaschoepite, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is the best method of water measurement.Brugger, J., Meisser, N., Etschmann, B., Ansermet, S., Pring, A. (2011a) Paulscherrite from the Number 2 Workings, Mt. Painter Inlier, Northern Flinders Ranges, South Australia: “Dehydrated schoepite” is a mineral after all. American Mineralogist, 96, 229-240. Structure Paulscherrerite is monoclinic (pseudo-orthrombic), with a = 4.288(2), b = 10.270(6), c = 6.885(5)Å, β = 90.39(4) = 90.39(4)o, V = 303.2(2)Å3, and Z = 4. No space group determination has been made, as no single-crystal study has been done. Given the very small crystallites (less than a few tens of nanometers), it is very difficult to distinguish an orthorhombic cell from a monoclinic cell with β close to 90° (Bevan et al. 2002). Possible space groups that explain all 46 reflections found include: P2, P21, P2/m, and P21/m. The structures of the closely related schoepite,Finch, R.J., Cooper, M.A., and Hawthorne, F.C.

(2000) Structure of uranium(VI) Oxidedihydrate, UO32H2O; synthetic meta-schoepite (UO2)4O(OH)6 · 5H2O. Acta Crystallographica, B56, 577-583. consist of layers formed by edge-sharing UO7 pentagonal bi-pyramids interspersed with hydrogen bounded water molecules. The structure of orthorhombic α-UO2(OH)2 (synthesized “dehydrated schoepite”), however, consists of layers formed by edge sharing UO8 hexagonal bipyramids.Taylor, J.C. (1971) The structure and form of uranyl hydroxide. Acta Crystallographica, B27, 1088-1091. The uranyl sheets in schoepite/metaschoepite and α-UO2(OH)2 are topologically related via the substitution 2(OH) = O2 + vacancy. Physical properties Paulscherrerite occurs as a microcrystalline powdery product with a maximum length of ~500 nm. It forms by the weathering and ultimate pseudomorphism of uranium-lead bearing minerals such as metaschoepite. Paulscherrerite is canary yellow, with a yellow streak, and no fluorescence. The Mohs hardness cannot be measured due to the powdery nature of the mineral, and no cleavage or fracture is observable. The calculated density is 6.66 g/cm3 for the ideal formula UO2(OH)2. No optical properties have been recorded. See Table 1 for a list of the physical properties of paulscherrerite. Geologic occurrence The type locality for paulscherrerite is the Number 2 Workings, Radium Ridge near Mount Painter, North Flinders Ranges, South Australia, which contains large volumes of granites and gneisses highly enriched in uranium and thorium. The Number 2 Workings expose a lens of massive coarse-grained hematite with a fine-grained monazite-(Ce), xenotime-(Y), and Ca-Fe-phosphate matrix and abundant iron-rich euxenite. The radiogenic heat produced by Uranium-Thorium-Potassium-rich rocks drove hydrothermal activity over hundreds of millions of years.Brugger, J., Foden, J., Wulser, P. (2011b) Genesis and preservation of a uranium-rich paleozoic epithermal system with a surface expression (North Flinders Ranges, South Australia): radiogenic heat driving regional hydrothermal circulation over geological timescales. Astrobiology, 11.6, 499. These conditions of high- temperature hydrothermal mineralization are ideal for the formation and deposition of abundant deposits of paulscherrerite, a dehydration product of metaschoepite. Secondary uranium minerals occur in cavities of the predominant hematite/quartz including weeksite, beta-uranophane, metatorbernite, soddyite, kasolite, billietite, and barite.Brugger, J., Krivovichev, S.V., Berlepsch, P., Meisser, N., Ansermet, S., and Armbruster, T. (2004) Spriggite, Pb3(UO2)6O8(OH)2(H2O)3, a new mineral with β-U3O8-type sheets: Description and crystal Structure. American Mineralogist, 89, 339-347. Figure 3. shows the geomorphology of the Mt. Gee – Mt. Painter epithermal system. “Dehydrated- schoepite” has also been identified as an early product of uraninite weathering in the Ruggles and Palermo granitic pegmatites, New Hampshire, U.S.Korzeb,S.L., Foord, E.E., and Lichte, F.E. (1997) The chemical evolution and paragenesis of uranium minerals from the Ruggles and Palermo granitic pegmatites, New Hampshire. Canadian Mineralogist, 35, 135-144. Special characteristics Schoepite, metaschoepite, and paulscherrerite result from the weathering of uranium minerals such as uraninite and the corrosion of anthropogenic uranium bearing solids.Finch, R.J. and Ewing, R.C. (1992) The corrosion of uraninite under oxidizing conditions. Journal of Nuclear Materials, 190, 133-156. The oxy-hydroxides of the shoepite subgroup act as precursors in the formation of more complex and stable assemblages (Brugger et al. 2003). Study of these minerals is important for understanding the mobility of uranium around mining sites, as well as designing successful strategies for the storage of nuclear weapons and the containment of nuclear waste. Biographic sketch Paulscherrerite is named in recognition of the vital contributions to mineralogy and nuclear physics of Swiss physicist Paul Scherrer (1890–1969). While studying at the University of Göttingen in 1916, he and Peter Debye, Scherrer’s mentor and eventual Nobel Prize winner, developed the powder diffraction theory (the Scherrer equation) and designed the Debye-Scherrer X-ray powder diffraction camera. By 1920, Scherrer had become interested in nuclear physics, was appointed to a professorship at the ETH Zürich, and was involved in the early development of solid-state physics, nuclear physics, and electronics. He was named President of the Swiss Study Commission for Atomic Energy in 1946 and took part in establishing CERN near Geneva in 1954 (Hephaestus, 2011). Since 1988, the Paul Scherrer Institute has been the largest Swiss national research institute, active in elementary particle physics, material sciences, and nuclear and non-nuclear energy research. The name for the mineral was proposed by Joel Brugger, a native of Switzerland, currently a QEII fellow at the University of Adelaide, Australia (MMSN, 2011).

The Treaty of Villafáfila is a treaty signed by Ferdinand the Catholic in Villafáfila on 27 June 1506 and by Philip the Handsome in Benavente, Zamora, on 28 June. The treaty recognised the incapacity of Ferdinand's daughter and Philip's wife, Joanna the Mad, to reign on her own as Queen of Castile. Joanna had succeeded her mother, Isabella the Catholic, who had appointed her husband and co-ruler Ferdinand as regent of Castile in the name of their mentally unstable daughter. However, Philip demanded his share in the government. The Treaty of Villafáfila followed the Treaty of Salamanca (24 November 1505), in which Ferdinand and Philip were recognised as co-regents in Joanna's name. However, the new treaty required Ferdinand to cede all power to Philip and retire to his own hereditary realms, the Crown of Aragon, to which Joanna was also heir presumptive, and proclaimed Philip jure uxoris King of Castile. Ferdinand renounced not only the government of Castile, but also the lordship of the Indies, leaving a half of the income of the kingdoms of the Indies. Joanna and Philip immediately added to their titles of \\"Kings of Indies, Islands and Mainland of the Ocean Sea\\". The treaty was made moot very soon, since King Philip I died on 25 September. This left Ferdinand free to assume the government of Castile, and again return to the regency of the crown and recover the title of lordship of the Indies, both of which he held until his death in 1516. The Indies remained in an ambiguous state from the death of Philip in 1506 to the death of Ferdinand in 1516, being half a personal property of the kings (a \\"lordship\\" with absolute power for its lord), and half a kingdom of the Crown (ruled under the laws of the Crown of Castile). From 1516 to 1520 the Indies were extraofficially part of the Crown of Castile. On July 9, 1520 Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor incorporated them explicitly into the Crown of Castile and he forbid any future separation.

The episode was written by co-creator and executive producer Brad Falchuk and was directed by Tim Hunter. This episode is rated TV-MA (LSV). In this episode, Violet (Taissa Farmiga) is confronted by a revelation, while Vivien (Connie Britton) learns she is pregnant with twins. In 2012, this episode was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Art Direction for a Miniseries or Movie. Plot A flashback shows that in 1994, Constance learns that Beau, her deformed son who lives chained in the house's attic, may be taken away, due to her neglectful parenting. In love with Constance, Larry euthanizes Beau, in order to prevent it. Violet takes solace in Tate, who reveals that he is aware of the ghosts, and says they will not harm her if she just tells them to leave her alone. He shows her some old photographs he found of the Montgomerys. Vivien learns that she is pregnant with twins. Resolved to be up front with prospective buyers about the house's past, she learns of the Montgomerys and learns that Charles revived their son into a monster, causing his wife Nora to go insane and kill Charles and herself. A sleazy developer becomes interested in the house, and reveals his plan to tear down the gazebo and build a pool, leading young Moira to seduce him in hopes that he will buy the property and her remains will be discovered. Ben confronts Larry at his home, and learns that Larry's wife immolated herself and their daughters in the house after he confesses he was leaving them for Constance, and wants the house so he can be with Constance. Ben mocks him by saying the developer will buy the house and tear it down to build condominiums. Constance learns of this and attempts to appeal to the developer, but he cruelly rebuffs her. She informs Moira that he lied to her about the gazebo and intends to build condos instead, which would seal Moira on the grounds forever. They put aside their enmity, and with Larry's help, lead the developer into the basement and suffocate him. They quickly take him off the grounds before he dies. Violet shares the photos of the Montgomerys with Vivien, who is shocked to find that she recognizes Nora as one of the interested buyers for the house (\\"Murder House\\").

I like to imitate her in the writer's room.\\" Reception Rotten Tomatoes reports an 82% approval rating, based on 11 reviews. The critical consensus reads, \\"\\"Open House\\" wraps up the first half of the season and blazes a cringe-worthy path towards the finale.\\" New York Magazine Julieanne Smolinski said of the episode, \\"I don't know...but I love this show as though it were the deformed attic monster I asked my disfigured boyfriend to lust-murder.\\" James Queally of The Star-Ledger called the episode \\"another average episode of what's becoming in my eyes, just an average series.\\" In its original American broadcast, \\"Open House\\" was seen by an estimated 3.06 million household viewers and gained a 1.8 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research.

In 1700 the senior line of the House of Habsburg became extinct with the death of King Charles II of Spain. The War of the Spanish Succession ensued, with Louis XIV of France claiming the crowns of Spain for his grandson Philip and Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I claiming them for his son Charles. The Pact was devised by Emperor Leopold I, on the occasion of Charles's departure for Spain.Holborn, 128.Holborn, 182. It stipulated that the claim to the Spanish realms was to be assumed by Charles, while the right of succession to the rest of the Habsburg dominions would rest with his elder brother Joseph, thereby again dividing the House of Habsburg into two lines. The Pact also specified the succession to the brothers: they would both be succeeded by their respective heirs male but should one of them fail to have a son, the other one would succeed him in all his realms.Kann, 58. However, should both brothers die leaving no sons, the daughters of the elder brother (Joseph) would have absolute precedence over the daughters of the younger brother (Charles) and the eldest daughter of Joseph would ascend all the Habsburg thrones.Crankshaw, 17.Mahan, 5–6. In 1705 Leopold I died and was succeeded by his elder son, Joseph I. Six years later, Emperor Joseph I died leaving behind two daughters, Archduchesses Maria Josepha and Maria Amalia. Charles, who was at the time still unsuccessfully fighting for the crowns of Spain, succeeded him according to the Pact and returned to Vienna. According to the Pact, the heir presumptive to the Habsburg realms was, at that moment, Charles's niece, Maria Josepha, who was followed in the line of succession by her younger sister, Maria Amalia. However, Charles soon expressed a wish to amend the Pact in order to give his own future daughters precedence over his nieces. On 9 April 1713, the Emperor announced the changes in a secret session of the council. The Pact was finally superseded by the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, promulgated by Charles to ensure the succession of his own daughters instead of Joseph's.

The episode was written by co-creator and executive producer Ryan Murphy and was directed by Miguel Arteta. This episode is rated TV-MA (LSV). In this episode, the identity of the Rubber Man and the father of Vivien (Connie Britton)'s twins are revealed while she is driven insane by some of the house's occupants. Kate Mara and Zachary Quinto guest star as Hayden McClaine and Chad Warwick, respectively. Jessica Lange is absent in this episode. The episode was released to mixed reviews, and holds a 58% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Plot Flashbacks reveal Tate to be the Rubber Man, who fathered Vivien's twins, attempting to provide a distraught Nora with a baby. The outfit is revealed to be a fetish suit Chad bought in hopes of reigniting his and Patrick's failing relationship. Tate donned the suit and killed Patrick and Chad after they decided not to have a child, hoping that a new family would move in and have a child, which Nora could then have instead. Moira gave Tate the couple's gun, which Tate used to make it look like a murder/suicide. Hayden conspires with Nora to drive Vivien insane so that they can have her twins after she is committed. After many poltergeists, Vivien becomes unnerved and Moira, who opposes Hayden, tells her about \\"The Yellow Wallpaper\\" and that the house is haunted, urging her to leave while she still can. Vivien and Violet leave, but are confronted by the ghosts of the house intruders (\\"Home Invasion\\") outside, fleeing back into the house. Ben believes that Vivien is mentally unstable, since the police found no evidence of the intruders' presence, and prohibits her from leaving under threat of legal action, believing she is trying to take Violet and the twins away from him. Though she also saw the ghosts, Violet, afraid to leave Tate, lies and says she didn't see anything. Betrayed, Vivien later steals Marcy's handgun for protection. Hayden convinces Tate, as the Rubber Man, to attack Vivien. During the attack, Vivien accidentally shoots Ben, who heard the commotion. He medicates her until the police arrive, convinced she is a danger to herself and others. Luke arrives, having received the panic alert, and he and Ben argue. However, Vivien's reaction to another poltergeist results in the police taking her away to be committed. Vivien is heartbroken, but consoled that she can finally leave the house. Violet feels guilty because she lied, though Tate tells her that he'll always be there for her. Production Evan Peters didn't find out until shooting began for \\"Rubber Man\\" that he was intended to be Rubber Man, and that he was both \\"shocked and grateful.\\" About his character's interaction with Nora Montgomery (Lily Rabe), he added, \\"He sees that Nora's soul is disturbed and is very sad. He has this sort of sweet spot for people like that. It resonates with him, so he wants to help them out and make sure they're okay and peaceful.\\" This was the only American Horror Story episode not to feature Jessica Lange until the beginning of the fifth season of the show, Hotel. Reception Rotten Tomatoes reports a 58% approval rating, based on 12 reviews. The critical consensus reads, \\"[\\"Rubber Man\\"] delivers the biggest reveal of the season as the mysterious identity of the man in the rubber suit is finally solved.\\" James Queally of The Star-Ledger evaluated the series after this episode, saying, \\"This show just continually feels like it's one step forward, two steps back. It's too inconsistent, and too reliant on noise and smoke, to make me care all that much.\\" TV Fanatic's Matt Richenthal commented on the episode, \\"For perhaps the first time all season, American Horror Story didn't leave me with many questions. There was plenty of frightening, violent nuttiness this week, but there were also answers.\\" In its original American broadcast, \\"Rubber Man\\" was seen by an estimated 2.81 million household viewers and gained a 1.6 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode was down two tenths from the previous episode.

Biography Angela Bambace was born in Santos, Brazil, to Giuseppina Calabrese and Antonio Bambace, immigrants from Leonforte, Sicily and Cannitello, Calabria, respectively, who had settled in Santos, Brazil. The family migrated to New York City in 1901 and settled in East Harlem. As a teenager, Angela and her sister Marie followed their mother into garment work, like most Italian immigrant women in New York City. Together they also attended meetings held by anarchists, socialists, and members of the Industrial Workers of the World and International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union in their neighborhood. Angela became a union member, organizer, staff member, and officer of the ILGWU from 1917 to 1972. Bambace first became a member of the Italian Waist and Dressmakers' Local 89 in 1917 and served as a key organizer in the dressmakers' strike of 1919. In the 1920s, she lived with her mother, sister, and brother-in-law—the Sicilian anarchist, journalist, and labor organizer Nino Capraro—Nino and Marie's two daughters Athena and Clytia, and Angela's two sons Philip and Oscar, in a two- family home in Flushing, New York. Angela lost custody of her sons to her first husband, Romolo Camponeschi, a waiter from Rome, in 1927, due to her labor activism. But she remained very close with both sons and their children throughout her life. In the late 1920s she met and fell in love with Luigi Quintiliano, an Italian immigrant anarchist and tailor by trade who served as secretary to the Italian Committee for Political Victims and played an active role in the Sacco and Vanzetti defense. The two would remain together for their entire lives. In the early 1930s, the ILGWU sent Bambace to organize garment workers in Baltimore. This temporary position became permanent in 1936 and by 1942, she was appointed the manager of the newly created Maryland- Virginia district of the ILGWU. She maintained that role after the district was reorganized as the Upper South Department. In 1956, she became the first Italian American woman elected Vice-President of the ILGWU and a member of the General Executive Board. Before joining the ILGWU, Bambace worked as an organizer for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. Throughout her life, she was involved in a variety of organizations, including Americans for Democratic Action, Baltimore Community Action Commission, United Nations Association, Southern Conference Education Fund, Maryland Commission on the Status of Women, and the Jewish Labor Committee. Bambace retired from the ILGWU in 1972 and died from cancer in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1975. Sources * ILGWU. Communications Department biography files. 5780/177.

The attack On May 2, 1959, four white men, William Collinsworth, Ollie Stoutamire, Patrick Scarborough, and David Beagles, set out together to find a woman to sexually assault. They approached a car at Jake Gaither Park armed with shotguns and switchblades. Patrick Scarborough pressed his shotgun against the African American driver's nose and ordered the occupants out of the car.\\"'It Was like All of Us Had Been Raped': Sexual Violence, Community Mobilization, and the African American Freedom Struggle\\" by Danielle L.

All four people in the car were students at Florida A&M; University (FAMU). Scarborough forced the two black men to kneel on the ground, and David Beagles held the two black women at knifepoint.

The officer on duty that night was a nineteen-year-old intern, Joseph D. Cooke, Jr. To the surprise of many people, he called for back up and searched for Owens. The officer spotted the assailant's car and a chase ensued. Eventually, the men pulled their car over and the muffled screams of Owens could be heard from the car.

This armed march would symbolize their protection of black womanhood with guns as the whites protected white womanhood.McGuire, D. L. (2011). At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape and Resistance - a New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power. Vintage Books. Other student leaders argued against an armed march and instead planned a “Unity” demonstration. Fifteen hundred students entered the Lee Auditorium to demand justice for Owens, and the student leaders announced that they would petition the governor for a \\"speedy and impartial trial\\". The following day, over a thousand students gathered with signs and prayers that were broadcast over news media. Many of these students connected the events to other issues in the struggle for black freedom, such as the desegregation issues in Little Rock, Arkansas. These students held up posters with scenes from Little Rock that read, \\"My God How Much More of This Can We Take\\". Even the BBC broadcast segments of the FAMU student demonstrations. As a result of prominent media coverage, student protests, and a threat to boycott classes, Judge W. May Walker called together a grand jury into special session on May 6, 1959.McGuire, Danielle L.

A nurse accompanied Owens because she was still undergoing treatment for injuries as well as depression. All four men pled not guilty, to the shock of the spectators in the courtroom. The innocence pleas made a jury trial mandatory. This case was significant because, for the first time in Florida, a judge sent white defendants charged with raping a black woman to jail to await their trial. Previously, Florida had never executed a white man for raping a black woman, and many thought that this could be the trial to change that.McGuire, Danielle L.

Ella Baker, the director the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, felt that the evidence in the case was so strong that the jury could not fail to convict.

Furthermore, he explained that \\"Appeals for justice will avail us nothing...

Pgs. 139-142 On June 12, 1959, Betty Jean Owens testified on her own behalf in front of 400 witnesses. She retold the events of the attack to the jury in detail. She told the jury, “I was so scared, but there was nothing I could do with four men, a knife, and a gun ... I couldn’t do anything but what they said.” The defence attorneys worked diligently to prove that Owens had consented to the attack and argued that if a rape did occur that she would have sustained more serious injuries. The doctors that treated Owens told the jury that her injuries resulted in a five-day hospital stay and that she was in a terrible condition. When the prosecution rested its case, the defence attorneys claimed that the state had failed to do anything but prove sexual intercourse had occurred and called for a judgment of acquittal. Judge Walker denied the motion and the defence was set to return the next day to present their case.McGuire, Danielle L.

Pgs. 143-145 The defense attorney claimed that the boys were intoxicated and that their taped confessions were inadmissible. However, under cross-examination, David Beagles admitted that his confession was voluntary. The defence tried to present the men as reputable and incapable of committing such a heinous crime. In another attempt to sway the jury, they characterized Owens as a Jezebel, who therefore could not have been raped. The jury read the verdict out loud: “guilty with a recommendation for mercy.” The “recommendation for mercy” part of the sentence kept the four men from facing the electric chair. Judge Walker deferred sentencing for 15 days and sent the four men to Raiford prison, now Florida State Prison. On June 15, 1959, Judge Walker sentenced all four men to life in prison. Following the sentence, Owens told reporters, “I feel better now for the first time since it happened. For the first time, I feel safe.”McGuire, Danielle L.

The Society is incorporated as a general ministry of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and serves the three branches (called \\"streams\\") of the Stone-Campbell tradition: the Churches of Christ, Independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). The Stone-Campbell tradition is named for the men generally recognized as its founders and early leaders, Barton Warren Stone (1772–1844) and Alexander Campbell (1788–1866). The Stone-Campbell tradition began on the Appalachian frontier in the early 1800s. History Disciples of Christ Historical Society was founded in 1941 and, from 1952 to 2015, was located in Nashville, Tennessee, where the Society was housed in the Thomas W. Phillips Memorial Archives, built in 1958 and placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. The building is remarkable for its late Gothic Revival limestone façade and numerous stained glass windows. In 2016, DCHS moved to a new office/meeting space in Bethany, West Virginia. The modern archival facility is adjacent to the grounds of Bethany College and the historic Campbell mansion. The location hails back to the importance spiritual ancestors, Alexander & Thomas Campbell, placed on education. Relocation of the Disciples of Christ Historical Society to Bethany offers opportunities for student- workers, the use of Historic Bethany and classroom-laboratory partnerships in church history and library science. Mission statement The mission of Disciples of Christ Historical Society is to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ by preserving the heritage and telling the story of the Stone-Campbell tradition. Disciples of Christ Historical Society is the primary archive and collective memory for Stone-Campbell congregations throughout the world. Our purpose is to collect and maintain documents and artifacts and we are an agency of proclamation. Like our founders we believe in the unity of all people of faith. Our mission, then, is to insure that the ideal which was delivered to us – an open and welcoming Church – will remain available for the generations to come. Holdings The Society holds the historic records of approximately 23,000 congregations, 40,000 bibliographic files, as well as personal papers of 35,000 members of the denomination, such as Ronald Reagan and Janice Joplin. The archives also house over 300,000 historic photographs. Among its more unusual holdings is a necklace made of leopard’s teeth from the Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), brought to the United States by Disciples missionary Royal J. Dye. In 2006, the Society partnered with the Christian Board of Publications to underwrite the publication of the first-ever global history of the Stone-Campbell tradition. In 2008, the Society opened a public exhibit hall to highlight and interpret its collections. In 2011, the Society established a collection of local church cookbooks in a new effort to depict local church history.

The episode was written by Jennifer Salt and was directed by John Scott. This episode is rated TV-MA (LSV). In this episode, a famous murder victim visits the house while Constance (Jessica Lange) learns of Tate's (Evan Peters) bad behavior. Kate Mara guest stars as Hayden McClaine. Taissa Farmiga is absent in this episode. Plot A flashback to 1947 shows a dentist, who lives and works out of the house, putting Elizabeth Short under anesthesia and raping her, but accidentally kills her. Dr. Montgomery dismembers her and her remains are later found in a field. A detective and Hayden's sister arrive at the house, believing Hayden has been murdered, but Hayden convinces them she's alive. Ben is told by a doctor that he is the father of only one of Vivien's twins. Ben walks in on young Moira and Elizabeth trying to seduce him and has enough; he fires Moira and throws Elizabeth out. Believing that Vivien cheated on him, Ben visits her in the ward. Thinking she is asleep, he berates her over the supposed hypocrisy and says he will never help her leave. Ben later tells Hayden he never loved her. Heartbroken, she lies that Luke slept with Vivien. Constance tries to make up with her younger boyfriend Travis and proposes to him, believing they can raise Tate's child together as a family. When he refuses, she mocks his dreams of becoming famous and he has sex with Hayden, who murders him. Travis' body is dismembered by Dr. Montgomery and taken away by Larry. His body is displayed in the same manner as Elizabeth's. Constance, desiring the child, visits Vivien in the ward, expressing her support for her. Vivien confides in her that she was raped by the Rubber Man, but will pretend it was a hallucination in order to be discharged from the ward. Ben confronts Luke, the security officer Vivien employed, but learns that he is infertile and therefore could not be the father. As Moira leaves, Ben finds the Rubber Man mask and demands to know the truth, now realizing that Vivien is not crazy and was indeed raped. Moira congratulates him for finally starting to see the truth, appearing to him for the first time in her \\"true\\" elderly form. Billie Dean Howard states to Constance that a child that is conceived between a ghost and a human is the Antichrist and will usher in the Apocalypse. Production Mena Suvari portrays the Black Dahlia in the episode. The episode was written by co-executive producer Jennifer Salt, and directed by John Scott. About using the Black Dahlia storyline, series co-creator Ryan Murphy said he's always been interested in unsolved L.A. crimes. \\"The thing that fascinated me about the case is that there were more than 60 people who claimed credit for that murder,\\" he said. \\"I've always been obsessed about that idea, that our culture [wants to know] what fame is about. Once I started researching the Black Dahlia for this episode, it made sense for me that she was killed in that house and I wanted to explore the '40s.\\" Reception Rotten Tomatoes reports an 80% approval rating, based on 10 reviews. Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic commented on the bizarre events of the episode, \\"Nothing much happened on American Horror Story this week, except for an appearance by The Black Dahlia, a cameo by The Pope and the revelation that Vivien might be giving birth to the Antichrist, just your basic episode of the FX drama.\\" The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff said, \\"We learned a bunch of things that will likely be important going forward, but they were also things that didn't really matter... It's been a bit of a step down since that brain-eating episode. This episode was a step in the crazy direction.\\" In its original American broadcast, \\"Spooky Little Girl\\" was seen by an estimated 2.85 million household viewers and gained a 1.7 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode was up one tenth from the previous episode.

For years known as the Gebi,\\" it was the seat of the power of Ethiopia's emperors. Within its confines are several residences, halls, chapels, and working buildings. Today it contains the offices and residence of the Prime Minister of Ethiopia. History The palace grounds contain different churches. The most important is the Ta'eka Negest (Resting Place of Kings) Ba'eta Le Mariam Monastery. It has a large Imperial crown at the top of the dome. The church serves as a mausoleum for Emperor Menelik II, his wife Empress Taitu, and Empress Zewditu, his daughter and eventual successor. Other churches within the grounds are the Se'el Bet Kidane Meheret Church (Our Lady Covenant of Mercy) and the Debre Mengist St. Gabriel Church. During the rule of Mengistu Haile Mariam, the palace grounds were used as a prison to house many notables of the government of Emperor Haile Selassie, the Emperor included. Built during this time was the Shengo Hall, accommodating the country's legislature, and the Presidential Office Building. In 2010, construction began on a new residence for Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and his family. The project, which was estimated to cost 80 million birr for a two-storey house, was being supervised by Meles's wife, Azeb Mesfin. Also part of the project were guest houses worth 25 million birr, and a thorough refurbishment of the palace gardens. In 2018 work began on a large-scale restoration of the palace compound, and in 2019 it was opened to the public as Unity Park Buildings Gibr Adarash The massive Gibr Adarash was used by Emperor Menelik II to give his periodic great \\"Gibr\\" feasts in which he fed large numbers of his subjects. It was later used as a venue for large gatherings or occasions Emperor Haile Selassie used it as the venue for especially large state banquets, such as the one held for the African Heads of State gathered to form the Organization of African Unity (now the African Union) in 1963, and the state dinners in honor of the visits of Queen Elizabeth II in 1965 and Charles de Gaulle. Zufan Adarash Zufan Adarash, the throne hall. The Zufan Adarash was used as the main throne hall for imperial audiences. During the Red Terror its cellars were used as an ad- hoc prison for high-ranking officials of the ancien régime. Te'eka Negist Mausoleum Burial place of Emperors Menelik II and Iyasu V and Empresses Zewditu and Taytu. Mausoleum in 1934 Shengo Hall The Shengo hall was built by the Derg at a cost of $18 million. It was prefabricated in Finland, and, at the time of its construction, was the largest prefabricated building in the world. It was opened on 9 September 1987 after the promulgation of the new constitution and election of the assembly, to a grand ceremony that counted Presidents Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, Hassan Gouled Aptidon of Djibouti and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt as guests. After the fall of the Mengistu government, the Ethiopian Parliament convened its previous chambers, and today the building is used as an occasional meeting place. Prime Minister's Office The building now housing the Prime Minister's Office was built at the same time as the Shengo Hall to house the offices of President Mengistu Haile Mariam. After his ouster it became the Prime Minister's Office, and was renovated in 2018-19 Bibliography * Livio Sacchi: Architectural heritage in Ethiopia.

The palace was built in 1955 to mark the Silver Jubilee of His Imperial Majesty Emperor Haile Selassie. After a coup attempt in the Guenete Leul Palace in 1960, the Emperor made the Jubilee Palace his main residence. However, the seat of government remained at the Imperial Palace. The palace was expanded and doubled in size between 1966 and 1967. The Jubilee Palace was the site of the dethronement of Emperor Haile Selassie in September 1974. Ten low ranking military officers appeared before the Emperor in the palace library and read him the statement of the Derg (military council), which officially removed him from the throne. The Derg renamed the Palace the \\"National Palace\\", which it still bears today. The Derg used this Palace for state ceremonies involving visiting heads of state, state banquets and receptions. The Derg added a swimming pool to the grounds. With the fall of the Derg, and the proclamation of the Federal Republic, the Jubilee Palace became the official residence of the President of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. The President has a ceremonial role and uses the palace for official functions. The Ethiopian Government has announced its intention to build a new official presidential residence. The National Palace will then be opened as a museum. It will continue to house the President of the Republic until that time.and the value of The Jubilee Palace is 1.5b doller.

Beginnings School, The cornerstone of the first of eleven buildings that would make up the boarding school's campus was placed in front of a crowd of more than 2,000 people from all over the state on October 18, 1892. As part of the crowd's celebration, they congregated in the town of Mount Pleasant, Michigan and then paraded out to the school grounds. The Grand Master of the Free and Accepted Masons was on hand to lead in the \\"ancient ritual\\" of laying the cornerstone and the Grand Chaplain led the crowd in a Christian prayer to bless the school and all those that would reside there. What then was known at the Mount Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School started as a small school run by the United Methodist Church and had previously been known as the \\"farm school\\" as it was out in the middle of farmland outside of Mount Pleasant. Buildings and grounds In 1892, the construction of the first school building for the purposes of educating Native American children began. October 18, 1892, dedication ceremonies for the main building took place and on January 3, 1893, the eight-classroom building opened to the first seventeen students. By June, 1893 enrollment had increased significantly and in the coming years it was necessary to build additional buildings to house all of the students and their daily activities. These included separate boys and girls dormitories, a hospital, a woodworking and blacksmith shop; a building for industrial training, a dining hall, a clubhouse for the employees of the school, several farm buildings, and the school built a new gymnasium in 1910. Adjacent to the school's location there was an \\"Indian Cemetery\\" that still exists today. The children Native American children from all over the State of Michigan along with children from Minnesota, Wisconsin, and New York came to the Mount Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School, which boasted an average enrollment of more than 300 students for many of the years it was open. School is in session The Native American children at the boarding school received basic academic instruction in grades kindergarten through eighth at the Mount Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School. A very strict and structured schedule focused on vocational training and religious education. Classes were offered in English language, woodworking, farming, sewing/tailoring, laundry, housekeeping and basic first aid. The coursework included learning how to fit into \\"white culture\\". The Mount Pleasant Branch of the Michigan Home and Training School Classes for the Native American children at the school continued until the school closed on June 6, 1934 when the State of Michigan took over the property for Michigan Department of Mental Health services. The property underwent a name change, at the time the State took it over, to The Mount Pleasant Branch of the Michigan Home and Training School. The intent of this home and training school was to house and train mentally handicapped young men. Many of the boys were abandoned; some were juvenile criminals that did not understand their crime or charges in court, even more of the residents were mentally or physically handicapped, but a majority of the residents had some kind of mental health issue. Closure The facility closed in 2008; the State of Michigan made the decision to close due to budget shortfalls at the state level and a dwindling number of patients being assisted at the location. Since their closure, the buildings have lain empty and abandoned. Today, the majority of the buildings' windows and doors are broken or boarded over and the buildings lie in disrepair. The interiors of the buildings are filled with old and used furniture, unused medical supplies, trash, and anything that was left behind by the staff. Much of the appearance of the interior is due to years of neglect and after the closure, the complex was left abandoned and vacant, which left the buildings and grounds vulnerable to vandals. It is now the property of the Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation. One plan is to make the former school a museum.http://www.cm-life.com/article/2014/01/under-the- shadow-of-history-abandoned-native-american-boarding-school-brings-to-light- one-tribes-str The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.

The company was well known for Lynda Carter (TV's Wonder Woman) appearing in its ads, including her famous trademark sayings such as \\"I wouldn't trust these baby blues to just anyone!\\" and \\"Make your life a whole lot easier!\\". In 2002, Lens Express was acquired by 1-800 Contacts. History In 1986 a business administration and finance student of University of Florida, Engin Yesil and his friend Yalie Golan started Lens Express from their Fort Lauderdale apartment. Engin was to have returned to Turkey to manage his father's shoe business, but saw a greater venture in Florida. Unlike other states, Florida provided a better opportunity for growth while still operating within state rules and regulations. This became important since Lens Express, as a company, was breaking ground for consumerism. In the 1980s the world of contact lens usage was exploding due to the growth of the soft contact lens market. However, access to contact lenses as a product was restricted as it was unsafe for people to purchase products from anyone other than the eye doctor. On April 2, 1985, WCBS-TV, New York Consumer Editor Betsy Ashton, interviewed by Meredith Vieira, reported on the optometric industry's battle against mail- order contact lens firms. Representing the American Optometric Association, Dr. Paul Farkas argued that mail order contact lenses were unsafe. Conversely, USA Lens founder Dr. Joseph Seriani extolled the virtues of his firm while arguing that many eye doctors' services were superfluous for otherwise healthy patients. The report also mentioned that certain states, including Hawaii, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Minnesota had restraint of trade laws in effect to prevent advertising for contact lenses. Launch The \\"way\\" for a mail order contact lens industry did not become clear until the Federal Trade Commission ruled in 1985, that eye doctors (Ophthalmologists and Optometrists) must provide the contact lens prescription to their patients so that the patient may shop for contact lenses as a consumer. Withholding a contact lens prescription would be considered restraint of trade. Linda J. Kaplan, MD, Ophthalmologist, a consultant to the FTC, and a liaison to the Ethics Committee for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, was an advocate for patient consumerism and joined forces with Lens Express in 1987. Under her leadership as Director of Quality Assurance the company grew into their first warehouse located in Pompano Beach. Company policy included that no contact lenses were sold to first time users, only replacement lenses were sold, all prescriptions were verified for accuracy etc. Dr. Linda Kaplan's national television and print campaign for Lens Express was directed at educating the American consumer: \\"I endorse the Lens Express program because they guarantee to deliver the exact same lenses your own doctor prescribed, while making the purchase of new, fresh replacement lenses, easy and convenient for thousands of men and women across America\\" Linda Kaplan, MD, PA, FAAO.Cosmopolitan Magazine, pg 277, May 1991 The message impact of safety, quality and convenience was strong. In the 1990s Joe Seriani filed a lawsuit against Lens Express charging that founders, Yalie Golan and Engin Yesil, used drug proceeds to start Lens Express.Case # 92-22923, FL Circuit Court, 11th Judicial Circuit, Dade County, FL filed Oct 26, 1992 It is unclear if Yalie Golan had been involved with USA Lens, but it seems the Florida Attorney General's Office did investigate that company as well. In the early 2000s, the executive Lens Express management team was designated under the leadership of CEO, Mike Lorelli, who represented the Strategic Optical Group, and CFO, Ron Kaplove who led the local management team in Deerfield Beach, FL. As a result of the charges, disruptive nature of the criminal investigation and professional threats, Dr. Linda Kaplan resigned from Lens Express and withdrew her endorsement. Concomitantly, Lynda Carter's husband, Robert A. Altman, a former attorney, made the acquaintance of Engin Yesil.{U.S. v. YESIL, 968 F.2d 1122 (1992), UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. Engin Kamil Yesil and Yalie Golan, Defendants } This lead Lens Express to procure the services of former Wonder Woman actress Lynda Carter for the new national television campaign: \\"I wouldn't trust these baby blues to just anyone!\\" In 1992 with the triad withdrawal of leadership of Engin Yesil, Yalie Golan and Dr Linda Kaplan prospects looked grim. However, Lens Express had developed a business model that could not fail.America at Night: \\"The True Story of Two Rogue CIA Operatives, Homeland Security Failures, Dirty Money and a Plot to steal the 2004 US Presidential Election – by the Former Intelligence Agent that foiled the plan By Larry J. Kolb\\" Riverhead Books The second group of Lens Express Directors included Mordechai Golan, Menderes Akdag, and Brian O'Neill. Lens Express pioneered the direct to consumer contact lens industry offering significant savings on factory sealed contact lenses. Shortly after the Alcon acquisition, the Lens Express management team consisted of CEO Mike Lorelli, CFO Ron Kaplove, Vp Sales Jeff Edelson, Vp Marketing, Debra Kania, Vp IT Sean odonahue. Ownership changes May 1996, Summit Technology acquired Lens Express for $32 million.http://sis.windhover.com/buy/abstract.php?id=199610104 In the 1990s Summit Autonomous Inc., was bereft with patent and other business litigation related to their excimer laser systems and procedures. (In 1995, they were the first excimer laser company to receive FDA approval for its excimer laser system for the correction of mild to moderate myopia in the U.S.) Their business model plan for expansion included the owning and operating of vision correction centers, via their subsidiary, Refractive Centers International, Inc. There were 19 such centers in the U.S. many of which were affiliated with prestigious national teaching hospitals. It was thought that additional to the positive cash flow of Lens Express, the acquisition of Lens Express' market base could create a channel for patient flow to convert contact lens wearers into Laser patients. May 2000 Summit Technology entered into an agreement to sell its Lens Express business unit to Strategic Optical Holdings, Inc. for $31 million cash, plus a minority equity interest in the acquiror.http://www.allbusiness.com/company-activities-management/company- structures/6478433-1.html#ixzz1k8Wei3Oj September 1, 2000 Summit Autonomous, Inc. was acquired by Alcon. and. November 26, 2002 – Lens 1st, a leading direct to consumer contact lens replacement company owned by Camelot Ventures, a Southfield, Michigan-based investment firm, acquired Lens Express. At that time, Lens Express had sold over 100 million contact lenses to over two million consumers. December 16, 2002, 1-800 CONTACTS, Inc. signed a letter of intent with Southfield, Michigan-based Camelot Ventures to acquire select assets of Lens Express and Lens 1st, the two leading U.S. mail-order contact lens retailers. Under the terms of the agreement, 1-800 CONTACTS acquired certain assets of Lens Express and Lens 1st, including databases, customer information, web addresses, phone numbers, and intellectual property rights. In addition, acquired assets included certain property, equipment, inventories and other tangible assets with an expected total value at closing of more than $5 million. The consideration to be paid included 900,000 restricted shares of common stock, $6.5 million in cash and the assumption of current liabilities with an expected value at closing of approximately $4.8 million.

He is best known for his wood sculptures but also produces jewelry and gifts. History Victor Grainger McKoy was born in Wilmington, North Carolina in 1947. After receiving an antique duck decoy from his grandmother as a child, McKoy carved his first bird out of wood - a shorebird from cypress wood. He is a graduate in the class of 1965 of Edmunds High School (now Sumter High School), Sumter, S. C. In 1965, he attended Clemson University in South Carolina and pursued a bachelor's degree in architecture, which turned into a zoology degree. After college, he took an apprenticeship under the bird carver Gilbert Maggioni. Once McKoy learned how to mold bronze and gold, he expanded his repertoire into steel, bronze, sterling silver, gold, and platinum. for these, he first carves into wood and then uses a lost-wax cast to produce metal pieces. He subsequently began creating smaller sculptures and casting them into jewelry for his wife. In 2010, a public park called Swan Lake Iris Gardens in Sumter, South Carolina, commissioned Grainger Mckoy to create an outdoor installation. \\"Recovery\\" is a stainless steel statue representing the wing of a pintail duck in flight.

At the beginning the club hosted the practise of athletics, association football, basketball, boxing, rugby union, and tennis. Sportiva Francesa was also founding member of the Argentine Basketball Federation. The rugby union team promoted to the first division in 1925. Deportiva Francesa moved from Wilde to Vicente López Partido in Greater Buenos Aires, close to the train station. The first official victory was in 1920 when Depo defeated Buenos Aires FC by 6-0. Between the decades of 1920 and 1930, the team took part in all the championships organised by the Rugby Union although the club facilities had been completely destroyed by a terrible flooding in 1921. Deportiva was promoted to first division in 1931 although the team was relegated to the second division the following year. Nevertheless, in 1947 a big group of players from Club Gimnasia y Esgrima de Buenos Aires joined Deportiva Francesa. The following year, Depo promoted to the first division where the team remained 16 seasons until 1963. Deportiva Francesa was the first Argentine rugby club to tour on Europe, where the team played 10 matches with 5 victories and 2 losses. The club played friendly games in Portugal, Spain, Italy, France and the Netherlands during the 87-day tour. In the 1950s and 1960s Deportiva played its home games in Castelar, Ramos Mejía and the city of Buenos Aires until 1957 when the club acquired the \\"Quinta Las Palmas\\", a country house located in Del Viso where Deportiva built its facilities.

The overall goal behind both sexes is reproductive success, which both male and female acquire through different techniques. For example, males do not mind dispensing their sperm into random females since their sperm are biologically less costly to produce and are found in abundance. They invest little time in the development of their offspring, and invest more energy on attaining their next mate. Male reproductive success is limited by the number of females he mates with, and not by the number of sperm that is produced. On the contrary, reproductive success in females is limited by the amount of eggs that are produced. The number of offspring created cannot exceed the number of eggs a female possesses. Unlike sperm, eggs are biologically very costly and numbered. In order for females to increase their reproductive success, they invest more time in creating high quality offspring and being choosy. Both sexes choose their mates based on favorable traits that are indicative of their mate's quality and fertility. Natural selection leads offspring to inherit favorable traits from each parent. This will make them likely to succeed in competition of resources and reproduction. However, traits that may be optimal for the fitness of one sex may not be optimal for the other. Since many organisms have a shared set of chromosomes, organisms are restricted from individually reaching optima for their individual sex. This as a result causes sex-specific reductions in fitness, and sexual conflict between males and females. Sexual conflict Conflict between the two sexes commonly arises in one of two possible situations. Members of one sex can acquire characteristics that benefit their ability to successfully reproduce, while negatively impacting the fitness of the opposite sex. This process is referred to as Interlocus sexual conflict. In genetics, a locus refers to the exact location of a gene on a chromosome. This type of sexual conflict occurs at different loci in each sex. This may result in a counter adaptation in an attempt to reduce harm in the sex that experiences reduced fitness at a different locus. For example, a female may diminish detrimental consequences of being subjected to male accessory gland proteins during mating by waiting longer to re-mate, or she may develop an opposite physical adaptation of her reproductive tract Alternatively, sex-specific reductions of fitness may occur within the same locus. These specific reductions of fitness are caused by different selective pressures that exist between the sexes. They are referred to as intralocus sexual conflict. Intralocus sexual conflict could ultimately displace the opposite sex, or both, from ever reaching a phenotypic optimum. Intralocus sexual conflict Intralocus sexual conflict occurs because many phenotypic traits are determined by a common set of genes which are found in both male and female individuals. For example, phenotypic traits such as body size, diet, development time, longevity, and locomotory activity have been suggested to underlie intralocus sexual conflict These traits may be subjected to antagonistic patterns of selection. In intralocus sexual conflict, individuals are not able to reach their evolutionary optima independently due to limitations that have been put in place by developmental systems. As a result, this type of conflict results in a negative fitness correlation between male and female individuals that have a particular trait A very good example of this can be seen in humans, regarding the selection pressures on height that varies between sexes. In nature, a negative correlation between the height of a woman and her reproductive success has been seen, with selection favoring relatively shorter women. On the other hand, men of average height are preferred, and have higher reproductive success than men who are shorter or taller in nature. Studies have been able to produce substantial evidence that concludes that higher reproductive success is obtained by females in sibling pairs that were shorter in height than males. Contrarily, reproductive success in sibling pairs of average height was much higher in males. These findings show that intralocus sexual conflict over a physical trait, such as height, can have an effect on Darwinian fitness in the human species. Development Chenowith et al. proposed a four phase model for the development of intralocus sexual conflict, in which the first phase is stabilizing selection on a trait in both sexes. Intralocus conflict then originates in the second phase when a change in physical or social conditions causes intense selection on that trait in males and/or females, and both sexes are displaced from their optimum. In the third phase, diverging selection continues on both sexes, but is attenuated. In the fourth phase, intralocus conflict is fully resolved and sexual dimorphism has occurred. Examples Intralocus sexual conflict diminishes the benefits of sexual selection. Examples of intralocus sexual conflict can be seen all throughout nature. In humans, males and females who appear to be more masculine in their physical appearance for their sex report to have brothers that score a higher mate value relative to their sisters. Similarly, individuals who are of normal weight and have higher levels of estradiol are positively correlated with higher mate values in women, and higher levels of testosterone are positively correlated with higher mate values in men. Individuals that are physically and hormonally more masculine tend to have brothers that are fairly more attractive than their sisters, while more feminine individuals have sisters that are more attractive than their brothers. This suggests that intralocus sexual conflict can mediate and determine the fitness of an individual. Human hips are another example, where females need larger hips for childbirth as opposed to smaller hips (optimal for walking) for males. The genes that affect hip size must reach a compromise that is at neither the male optimum nor the female optimum. In the Ibiza wall lizard (Podarcis pityusensis), intralocus sexual conflict exist over color. In this species, color is used as a signal of male fighting ability. Males that are more brightly colored are perceived as better fighters. As lizards in this species age, they become larger and more colorful. During mating seasons, males will typically compete for females and resources by fighting with each other. Males will select opponents based on the intensity of the color of their opponent's coat. Females of this species also possess brightly colored coats. This trait is detrimental for females, since being colorful makes them more conspicuous to males and predators. However, in males, being colorful helps males win fights and increases their reproductive success. Another example can be seen in the features of the soay sheep (Ovis aries) horns, and the length of the serin finch's (Serinus serin) tail. Males that possess larger horns or longer tails in these species have higher success during male competition and increased reproductive success. However, these features require a great deal of energy for females to possess and do not benefit females in any significant way. Intralocus genetic differences between males and females have been identified in a variety of fish species using RAD sequencing, including gulf pipefish and deacon rockfish. It has been hypothesised that some of the loci in deacon rockfish may be examples of intralocus sexual conflict but their function and evolutionary significance is currently uncertain. Resolution There have been several hypotheses made that attempt to explain possible resolutions for intralocus sexual conflict. In one proposition, it is suggested that intralocus sexual conflict can be minimized through sex-dependent gene regulation. By doing this, genes that are negatively selected may evolve sexually dimorphic traits that encourage sex- specific optima. Sexual dimorphism is thought to be an effective resolution, since it can be made irreversible under short term selection. As a result, sexual dimorphism could pose as a resolution to intralocus sexual conflict. Another proposed hypothesis suggests that intralocus sexual conflict can be resolved through alternative splicing. In this mechanism, the gender of an organism will ultimately decide the final form of the protein that is created from a shared coding region within a set of genes. Through this posttranscriptional process, RNA that is created by a gene is spliced in various ways that allow it to ultimately join exons in a variety of ways Genomic imprinting also presents as a possible resolution for intralocus sexual conflict. In genomic imprinting, genes are marked through methylation of DNA with information of its parental origin. In order for genomic imprinting to resolve intralocus sexual conflict, parents would have to imprint their genes in sex- specific matter. For example, males could imprint their genes in a way so that sexually antagonistic alleles that benefit males are not expressed in sperm that is only X- bearing However, the resolution of intralocus sexual conflict is not easy to resolve. Intralocus sexual conflict is limited by the shared genotypes that exist between the traits of males and females. As a result, these shared genotypes often result in opposite fitness outcomes for each gender References Arnqvist, Goran and Locke Rowe. 2005. Sexual Conflict. Princeton University Press.

It was adopted by Parliament the year after the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 (see Popish Recusants Act 1605). The oath was proclaimed law on 22 June, 1606; it was also called the Oath of Obedience (). Whatever effect it had on the loyalty of his subjects, it caused an international controversy lasting a decade and more. Oath The oath was proclaimed law on 22 June 1606. It contained seven affirmations, and was targeted on \\"activist political ideology\\".Patterson, W. B., King James VI and I and the Reunion of Christendom, Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 80 The oath in part read: \\"I, A.B. do truly and sincerely acknowledge, profess, testify, and declare in my conscience before God and the world, that our Sovereign Lord King James, is lawful and rightful King of this realm, and of all other in his Majesties Dominions and Countries; And that the Pope neither of himself, nor by any authorities of the Church or See of Rome, or by any means with any other hath any power or authority to depose the King, or to dispose any of his Majesty's kingdoms, or dominions, or to authorize any foreign prince to invade or annoy him, or his countries, or to discharge any of his Subjects of their allegiance and obedience to his Majesty,\\"The English Parliament under James I\\", Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs, Georgetown University or to authorize any foreign prince to invade him &c.;, or to give license to any to bear arms, raise tumults, &c.; &c.; Also I do swear that notwithstanding any sentence of excommunication or deprivation I will bear allegiance and true faith to his Majesty &c.; &c.; And I do further swear that I do from my heart abhor, detest, and abjure, as impious and heretical this damnable doctrine and position,--that princes which be excommunicated by the pope may be deposed or murdered by their subjects or by any other whatsoever. And I do believe that the pope has no power to absolve me from this oath. I do swear according to the plain and common sense, and understanding of the same words &c.; &c.; &c;\\" (3 James I, c. 4).Pollen, John Hungerford. \\"English Post-Reformation Oaths.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 19 April 2019 Papal response Pope Paul V Both Pope Paul V and Cardinal Bellarmine wrote letters condemning the oath.North, Marcy L. “Anonymity's Subject: James I and the Debate over the Oath of Allegiance.” New Literary History, vol. 33, no. 2, 2002, pp. 215–232. JSTOR On 22 September 1606 Pope Paul V condemned the formula: \\"It cannot be taken, as it contains many things evidently contrary to faith and salvation. James then asserted that his oath was not meant to encroach upon anyone's conscientious convictions. Hereupon minimizers began to maintain that the words of the oath might be interpreted by the intention of the law-giver, that the oath might therefore be taken. If King James had made his subjects swear specifically \\"in the sense by him explained\\", the oath might perhaps have been endured, but when he made them \\"swear according to the plain and common sense, and understanding of the same words\\", to what was injurious to Catholic consciences, this could not be tolerated. Catholic views The new oath of allegiance was drafted in such a way that it was bound to create divisions within the English Catholic community as to whether it could be taken in good conscience. Following the Gunpowder Plot, archpriest George Blackwell, then head of the English Catholic secular clergy, wrote to Rome and obtained a letter from Pope Paul V condemning the plot and calling on English Catholics not to disturb the peace. Blackwell had at first disapproved of the oath, but citing the Pope's call for civil obedience, advised his priests that the oath could licitly be taken. The Pope, however, condemned the new oath soon afterwards. After the pope's Brief, he disallowed it once more. Blackwell was captured on 24 June 1607 and interrogated over the following ten days was about his opinion of the oath. At the end of that period he was tendered the oath, which he took, relying on James's statement that no encroachment on conscience was intended, and recommended others do the same. The pope then issued a new Brief (23 August 1607), repeating his prohibition. Bellarmine wrote a letter (18 September 1607) to Blackwell, an acquaintance from Flanders many years previously, reproaching him for having taken the oath in apparent disregard of his duty to the pope. Blackwell's position satisfied neither the Pope, who condemned it within days of Bellarmine's letter and replaced Blackwell by George Birkhead (February 1608), nor the English government, who imprisoned him. In 1603, William Bishop, a secular priest, had drawn up a \\"Protestation of Allegiance\\" to Queen Elizabeth, signed by twelve other priests besides himself, in which they took up their stand against those who aimed at the conversion of England by political means. Ward, Bernard. \\"William Bishop.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 19 April 2019 He was later examined on 4 May 1611, he said he was opposed to the Jesuits, but declined to take the oath of allegiance, as Blackwell and others had done, because he explicitly rejected the deposing power, but refused the oath as he wished to uphold the credit of the secular priests at Rome, and to get the English College there out of the hands of the Jesuits.\\"Bishop, William\\". Dictionary of National Biography. London: Smith, Elder & Co. 1885–1900. Controversy There is a range of views among contemporary scholars about King James's intention in requiring the oath. These include: * (Programmatic) to forward a wider theological and ecumenical project (Patterson); * (Persecuting) to give grounds for bearing down on English Catholics who faced the dilemma of swearing or not (Questier); * (Anti-papalist) to target supporters of papal temporal authority (Somerville); or * (Assertive) to assert his own spiritual authority (Tutino).Stefania Tutino, Empire of Souls: Robert Bellarmine and the Christian commonwealth (2010), p. 128; Google Books. It is seen as aimed at resistance theorists as well as traitors; and a move to split \\"moderates\\" from \\"radicals\\" among English Catholics.Rebecca Lemon, Treason by Words: Literature, law, and rebellion in Shakespeare's England (2008), p. 110; Google Books. There were unintended consequences. According to W.B. Patterson, \\"James himself did not give up his vision of a peaceful and united Church at home and abroad which he had unfolded to Parliament at its opening session in 1604. But in defending the Oath of Allegiance, he allowed himself to be drawn into a bitter Europe- wide theological controversy.\\" By the beginning of 1609 it had begun to touch on a whole range of European issues: English Catholics, Rhineland Calvinists, Gallicanism in France, the aftermath of the Venetian Interdict, and the uncertain Catholic orthodoxy of the Vienna court of Emperor Rudolph II. It had repercussions for international diplomacy; and in particular the handling of the Premonition had a negative effect on diplomatic relations between Great Britain and Venice, which had been improving during the Interdict.David Wootton, Paolo Sarpi (1983), p. 92. Bellarmine drawn in Robert Bellarmine James attacked Bellarmine early in 1608 in a treatise Triplici nodo, triplex cuneus, the title of which identified it in a learned fashion as an answer to the missives sent to Blackwell.Triplici nodo, triplex cuneus. Or An Apologie for the Oath of Allegiance. In translation from Latin \\"A triple wedge for a triple knot\\", i.e., for two papal briefs and the Bellarmine's letter). It was published anonymously in English around February 1608, and was then translated into Latin and French. It was the work of James, supported by advice from Lancelot Andrewes, Richard Bancroft and James Montague. The cardinal answered with a Responsio,Responsio ad librum: Triplici nodo, triplex cuneus (1608). using the pseudonym Matthaeus Tortus (i.e. Matteo Torti or Torto, his chaplain); he portrayed James as smooth in past correspondence with the papacy, but delivering little in practical terms. This accusation raked up a matter from before James's accession to the English throne. In 1599 a letter signed by James had been sent to Pope Clement VIII, requesting him to give a cardinal's hat to William Chisholm, a kinsman of James Elphinstone, 1st Lord Balmerino, and expressing high regard for the Pope and the Catholic faith. Originally, it had been dismissed as a forgery. When the matter was brought up again in 1606, severe pressure was put by Dunbar and Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury on Balmerino to induce him to take the whole blame on himself, and on the promise that his life and estates should be secured to him he consented to exculpate the king. The account he then gave was that he had written the letter, and had surreptitiously passed it in among papers awaiting the king's signature. Balmerino was disgraced and sentenced to death, but the sentence was never carried out,\\"Elphinstone, James\\". Dictionary of National Biography. London: Smith, Elder & Co. 1885–1900 and he later retired to his estates. According to a second account of Balmerino, James was well aware of the letter's contents and had signed without hesitation. Besides the main disputants, a number of secondary writers joined the fray. On the Catholic side were: Cardinal Duperron, Leonard Lessius, Jacob Gretser, Thomas Fitzherbert, Martin Becan, Gaspar Scioppi, Adolph Schulckenius, Nicolas Coeffeteau, and Andreas Eudaemon Joannes. Robert Persons wrote his Treatise tending to Mitigation (1608).Carrafiello, Michael L.,Robert Parsons and English Catholicism, 1580–1610 (1998), pp. 124–5 No one was more closely identified with the Jesuit role in the English mission than Parsons, and he was already a central figure in the polemics around it. William Barlow made mischief by suggesting Parsons in any case was second fiddle to Robert Bellarmine.Victor Houliston, Catholic Resistance in Elizabethan England: Robert Persons's Jesuit polemic, 1580–1610 (2007), p. 173; Google Books Opposed to them were: Lancelot Andrewes, William Barlow, Robert Burhill, Pierre du Moulin, the poet John Donne (in his Pseudo-Martyr of 1610) and the Benedictine Thomas Preston, who wrote in defence of the oath.Hunter-Blair, Oswald. \\"Thomas Preston.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 19 April 2019 James' response Andrewes replied to Bellarmine in Tortura Torti (1609). James insisted that Andrewes included in Tortura Torti references to the idea that if a Pope meddled with the temporal allegiances of Catholics, this was with indication of an identification of the Antichrist of the Book of Revelation. James politicised the whole debate with his PremonitionA Premonition to Christian Princes, and an appendix on his adversaries' supposed mistakes (January 1609). in the same year, dedicated to the Emperor Rudolph II and all the monarchs of Christendom. In it James now dropped his anonymity, and posed as the defender of primitive and true Christianity. In the Premonition James shifted to a more equivocal position.Sharpe, Kevin, Faction and Parliament: essays on early Stuart history (1978), p. 48 His view was that the identification could not be required as a matter of faith. He spoke of it as conjectural; but as a belief to which he was committed, at least as long as the interference in temporal matters persisted. He balanced these statements with concessions on the Pope's spiritual status.Tutino, Stefania. Law and Conscience: Catholicism in early modern England, 1570–1625 (2007), p. 136 Half of the book dwelled on this topic, expressed in terms offensive to Catholics. James's approach seemed to be a bargaining chip, or feeler for negotiations, to the diplomat Antoine le Fèvre de la Boderie. Gallican reaction After this, Bellarmine published, now also using his own name, his Apologia pro responsione ad librum Jacobi I (1609). James opposed to this a treatise by a learned Scottish Catholic, William Barclay, De potestate papae (1609). Barclay's views were on the Gallican side, and Bellarmine's answer, Tractatus de potestate summi pontificis in rebus temporalibus (1610), gave offence to French Gallicans; it was publicly burnt in Paris by a Decree of 26 November 1610. In reply to a posthumous treatise of Barclay, Bellarmine wrote a Tractatus de potestate summi pontificis in rebus temporalibus. It reiterated his assertions on the subject of papal power, and was prohibited in France. Another prominent rejection of Bellarmine's claim of papal superior authority was made by philosopher Thomas Hobbes in the third and fourth book of his Leviathan. Francisco Suárez's answer to James was the Defensio fidei (1613), a major statement of the Catholic position, and also an important landmark in political thought.André Azevedo Alves, Jose Moreira, John Meadowcroft, The Salamanca School (2009), p. 22; Google Books. It suffered the same fate as Bellarmine's Tractatus, through an arrêt of 26 June 1614; but this decree was eventually withdrawn at the request of the Pope. It was burned in London, too, in 1613.John P. Doyle, M. W. F. Stone, Collected Studies on Francisco Suarez SJ (2010), p. 261; Google Books. Subsequent history The main years of the controversy were 1608 to 1614, but publications directly connected with it appeared until 1620.James Doelman, King James I and the Religious Culture of England (2000), p. 105; Google Books. Subsequently it remained a topic of polemics, but Charles I was little interested in continuing his father's patronage of writers who addressed it. By the 1630s authors such as Du Moulin and David Blondel on these topics could expect no reward.Anthony Milton, Catholic and Reformed: The Roman and Protestant Churches in English Protestant Thought, 1600–1640 (2002), pp. 399–400; Google Books. The oath was used against Catholics during the rest of the 17th century, for example in the cases of Robert Drury, Thomas Atkinson, John Almond, John Thulis, Edmund Arrowsmith, Richard Herst, George Gervase, Thomas Garnet, John Gavan, and Henry Heath; the last two left writings against it. George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, a Catholic, found his attempt to settle in Virginia, where the oath had been introduced in 1609, was defeated by it. His son Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, on the other hand, ordered his adventurers to take the oath, but whether he insisted on this is uncertain.Hughes, \\"Soc. of Jesus in N. America\\", pp. 260–1, 451 and passim. Charles I of England generally recognised that Catholics could not conscientiously take the Oath of Supremacy, and frequently exerted his prerogative to help them to avoid it. On the other hand, his theory of the divine right of kings induced him to favour the Oath of Allegiance, and he was irritated with the Catholics who refused it or argued against it. Pope Urban VIII is said to have condemned the oath again in 1626,Reusch, 327. and the controversy continued. Preston still wrote in its defence; so also, at King Charles's order, did Sir William Howard (1634); this was probably the future William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford. Their most important opponent was Jesuit Father Edward Courtney,vere Leedes; cf. Gillow, \\"Bibl. Dict.\\", s. v. Leedes, Edward. who was therefore imprisoned by Charles. The matter is frequently mentioned in the dispatches and the \\"Relatione\\" of Panzani, the papal agent to Queen Henrietta Maria.Maziere Brady, \\"Catholic Hierarchy\\", Rome, 1883, p.88. The Sorbonne, on 30 June 1681, shortly before approving the Gallican articles, censored the English oath, and found in it very little to object to. References Sources * W. B.

The lock flight has a staircase, and at the highest lock the remains of older narrow locks can be seen. History The locks are on a section of canal which was originally part of the Warwick and Napton Canal. When authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1794, it was intended to be a canal from a junction with the Warwick and Birmingham Canal at Warwick to the Grand Junction Canal at Braunston, and was called the Warwick and Braunston Canal. Construction began in 1795, but in August a yeoman from Barford called Charles Handley suggested that £50,000 could be saved if the canal terminated at Napton on the Oxford Canal instead of Braunston. A second act was obtained in 1796, authorising a new route from near Offchurch, where the canal crossed the Fosse Way Roman road, and the company became the Warwick and Napton Canal company. Bascote Locks are on this revised route, and would not have been built had the original route been followed. The Grand Junction Canal were building their route from London to Braunston as a broad canal, and tried to persuade the Warwick and Napton Canal to do the same, but they were convinced that most traffic would come from the Birmingham system and the Dudley Canal, and built the locks suitable for boats. The canal opened on 19 March 1800, and the Grand Junction opened to Braunston later that year. The four Bascote locks are numbers 14 to 17 out of a total of 23 locks which descend from Napton, the final one of which is called Radford Bottom Lock, and is close to where the route as built left the planned route to Braunston. Two more locks raised the level again just before the junction with the Warwick and Birmingham Canal. The Warwick and Napton Canal and the Birmingham and Warwick Canal both faced stiff competition from the railways, and declared themselves bankrupt in the early 1850s. The companies were reconstituted by the receiver, and continued to trade. From 1917, they were managed jointly, and on 1 January 1929, were sold to the Regent's Canal, and with the Grand Junction Canal, became part of the Grand Union Canal. In order to effectively compete, the new company wanted to upgrade the canals so that wide barges could be used between London and Birmingham. Their aim was to accommodate barges wide immediately, and ultimately to make the route suitable for barges. 52 locks on the two Warwick canals were converted into weirs, and 51 new locks, each were built. There was one less because the flight of six at Knowle was replaced by five. In order to give a depth of , the height of weirs were raised or lock sills were lowered. As part of the work, the top two locks at Bascote were made into a staircase pair. Although the Duke of Kent performed an opening ceremony on 30 October 1934 at the top lock of the Hatton flight, to mark the completion of the project, work continued until 1937. One boat was built, but without widening the bottom of the canal, there were many places where two such boats could not pass, and the new locks were used by pairs of narrow boats. Location In common with many of the locks on this section of the canal, the remains of the original locks can still be seen beside the newer ones. The four locks raise the level of the canal by . Below the bottom lock, the canal is level for to Welsh Road Lock, and above the top lock, it is level for to Itchington Bottom Lock. The paddles on the locks reflect the style of the Warwick and Napton Canal, and are different from those further south, where the canal was built by the Grand Junction company.

Edwin Hurlbut (October 10, 1817 – November 28, 1905) was an American lawyer, editor, politician and humanitarian. Early years Born in 1817 in Newtown, Connecticut, one of ten children of Philander and Julia Alma (Thomas) Hurlbut. The family moved to Bradford County, Pennsylvania when Edwin was seven years old. They made the trip in a covered wagon, which they lived in until they cleared the land and built a log house on their one thousand acre homestead. During the three months of winter Edwin walked four miles a day through the forests to the nearest school, which was held in a log house. The remainder of the year he aided his father in cutting timber, digging up stumps and transforming the wilderness into meadow and grain field. Edwin credits these years of hard labor to his later in life gnarled and stiff fingers and joints, which he would state were not the fingers of either a lawyer nor editor. He also attributed these early life experiences to his determination to never shrink from a task. Eight years later fifteen-year-old Edwin walked to New Jersey. He states that \\"...when quite a chunk of a boy, with light heart and elastic step I left home and walked over the mountains and through the woods to Newark, New Jersey, 100 miles distant, to visit Grandma Thomas.\\" He lived there a year and then walked back to Pennsylvania to resume an occupation as a woodchopper.R.F.Howard, Edwin Hurlbut claims to be founder of Republican Party, The Waukesha Freeman, December 25, 1902Parker McCobb Reed, The Bench and Bar of Wisconsin, history and biography, with portrait illustrations Early career Hurlbut left the Pennsylvania homestead and went West to spend a short time in Eaton County, Michigan, but soon returned East to study law at Lodi, in Seneca County, New York, where he opened a law office and married Catherine Chandler in 1840. In 1842 he began studying law with David Wilmot in Towanda, Pennsylvania., and was admitted to the bar in 1847. He lost his home to foreclosure, so in 1848 he moved his family to Mason, Ingham County, Michigan. There he practiced law, was Postmaster, District Attorney, and judge advocate for the Michigan Militia. In April, 1850 he began an immigration to California, stopping in Milwaukee and then in Waukesha where his brother James and family were living. While visiting his brother he visited Oconomowoc and said, \\"That settled me. I thought it the most enchanting spot I had ever seen. If anyone could make a living there I could, I thought, and there I made my home and the California trip was abandoned.\\" He began practicing law and was appointed attorney for the Milwaukee and Watertown Plankroad Company. It was in 1854 that his community position and influence gave him voice to call for a convention and name the Republican Party in the Madison, Wisconsin, in July, 1854. Family life Edwin Hurlbut home, Oconomowoc, Wisconsin Hurlbut was married to Catherine Chandler in 1840 and they had three daughters together, Julia Augusta, Henrietta Catherine and Kate Florabell. It was before the days of title insurance, and he lost the home he paid for to foreclosure, and traveled West looking for a new start with his wife Catherine. From nothing he built a fine reputation and income to support his family. His wife Catherine died in 1864 and he remarried the following December to Mary H. Farner of Waukesha. His third marriage was October 14, 1886 to Margaret (Margie) Spearing of New Orleans, Louisiana, and they had two daughters, Edwina (1887–1981) and Margie (1889–1979). His second family enjoyed the fruits of his youthful labors, and the daughters of his old age reflect that he and his young wife Margie (43 years his junior) had always appeared to be in love. She assisted him in the newspaper business,Wright's Directory of Waukesha County, 1899, full page photo advertisement on p,172 which she managed after his death for eighteen months until she sold it.The Eau Claire Leader, March 14, 1907, p.4 Hurlbut was referred to as a man of positive character, a self reliant, self-made man, who worked his own way through life; and as a lawyer ranked among the best talent in the state.Edwin Hurlbut Biographical Sketch, History of Waukesha County, Western Historical Company, Chicago 1880. He was a man of strong convictions, steadfast in purpose, and unwavering in his dedication to what he believed to be right. He was a staunch prohibitionist and was never known to drink alcohol, but with a twinkle in his eye, he would say he didn't drink nor smoke, but he did have one weakness — women.Mrs. Page Johnson, Hurlbut named Republican party, The Oconomowoc Enterprise, September 9, 1976, p.16, columns 6,7,8. Religion Hurlbut was originally a Baptist, and built, mainly at his own expense, a church for the Oconomowoc Baptist Society, at the cost of $5000.00. It was destroyed by a wind storm and never rebuilt. He later became a member of the Episcopalian church. He was also a 32nd degree Mason, a Knight Templar, a Noble of the Mystic Shrine, and held the office of Grand worthy Patriarch of the Grand division of the Sons of Temperance of the State of Wisconsin. Political life In 1832, before political parties were divided over slavery, Hurlbut campaigned as a Jeffersonian Democrat with his father, for the election of Andrew Jackson's second term. His involvement in the anti- slavery and freesoil causes began while in the employ of David Wilmot in Towanda, Pennsylvania. Wilmot, who later became a U.S. Congressman in 1844 and introduced the Wilmot Proviso. After the following incident in Wilmot's office in 1842, Hurlbut became a freesoiler sympathizer, making speeches and traveling by wagon with a flag inscribed \\"Polk and the Tariff\\" in 1844, and advocated for Cass in 1848: From Hurlbut's arrival in Wisconsin in 1850, he is known for the following: * 1850 the first Wisconsin state Governor Nelson Dewey signed papers making Hurlbut a notary public. * 1854 called for political rally in Madison at which he helped develop a platform and named the new party republican. * 1857 & 1859 he campaigned for his friend Governor Alexander Randall, who was governor from 1858-62. * 1858 Appointed attorney for the Milwaukee, Beaver Dam & Baraboo Railroad. * 1861 Colonel on Governor Randall's staff, actively recruiting soldiers for the Union army. * 1869 he was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly. * 1870 he was appointed by Governor Fairchild to represent him at the International Conference on Penitentiary and Reformatory Discipline. The president of the conference was Rutherford B. Hayes. * 1872 he was appointed as a delegate to the International Penitentiary Congress, which met in London, England. * 1872 he supported Horace Greeley for president, who lost to U.S. Grant. * 1873 he was elected District Attorney for Waukesha County under the Reform Party ticket. * 1874 member of the National Prison Congress held in St. Louis, Mo., and was made a trustee and on the criminal law reform committee. * 1875 a trustee for National Prison Association in New York, on the committee for discharged convicts. * 1875 bought and edited the Wisconsin Free Press, which he maintained until his death in 1905, which was devoted to his interests in the Reform Party. * through the years he held various Oconomowoc city offices including the clerk of the school board for twelve years. Colonel Hurlbut was raised and active as a Jeffersonian Democrat, but just prior to the founding of the Republican Party in Madison, Wisconsin. in 1854, he wrote the platform for the American Party, which held that all political parties should be held by Americans born in this nation, make slavery a local issue, stand for prohibition, and rule it a state issue to make rivers and harbors navigable. The publishing of the book Uncle Tom's Cabin in 1852, and the passing of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in March 1854 further polarized the nation concerning the expansion of slavery, but it was an incident in March 1854 which propelled the process of Hurlbut's naming the Republican party. This incident involved some citizens of Milwaukee, under the leadership of Sherman Booth the editor of The Free Democrat. This citizen group overpowered federal marshals who had apprehended Joshua Glover, a runaway slave, and freed Glover. Hurlbut states that while the excitement was at its height, he met with Mr. Booth and said to him: The remainder of the above conversation expressed Hurlbut's conviction that a July rally in Madison could crystallize anti-slavery sentiment and carry the state. Hurlbut actively promoted the convention and Sherman Booth printed the convention notice in his newspaper for four weeks prior to the rally. Hurlbut was the only person at the rally from Waukesha County among the crowd of 3,000. He was appointed to the resolution committee, which a)pronounced against the extension of slavery into the territories, b)against the fugitive slave law, and c)proposed that slavery should be confined to its present limits. This platform was adopted by a unanimous vote. When the question arose of breaking away from the old parties arose, Hurlbut says he feared the whole thing would come to an end unless something radical was done. He quickly wrote and offered an amendment which resolved that all political differences would be put aside until the resolutions were accomplished. His resolution was adopted, and then came the call for a name of the new party. Hurlbut then stated: He was a delegate to the first national Republican convention, which nominated Gen. John C. Fremont for the presidency in 1856, with the slogan \\"Free Soil, Free Men, Fremont\\". He continued to support the party which he had helped to form, by voice and pen until Grant's renomination in 1872, when he left the Republican ticket and supported Horace Greeley, who opposed president Grant's continuation of reconstruction. From that time he acted with the Democratic party until 1890, when he could not endorse its stand on the school question. He returned to the Republican party and continued to work for prison reform and prohibition. Who named the Republican Party? Prior to the nineteenth century, the Quakers, Samuel Sewall, Samuel Hopkins and Jonathan Edwards (the younger), were lone voices against slavery. During the Second Great Awakening in the first part of the 19th century, convictions quickly changed with revivalist preachers, including Charles Finney, decrying the evil of slavery. By the 1840s an anti-slavery and abolitionist movement had gained enough momentum for the establishment of political groups such as the Liberty Party and Free Soil Party. It was in 1842 that Edwin Hurlbut had his experience in Wilmot's office (see above). The Wilmot Proviso was in 1846, Harriet Tubman began her work, and the new Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 further propelled the slavery controversy. The publication in 1852 of Harriot Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, the publication of Appeal of the Independent Democrats, and the passing of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in early 1854 further stoked the fires against slavery. Prior to the Joshua Glover case, which motivated Hurlbut to call for the convention in Madison (see above), there were at least three similar runaway slave rescue situations since 1850, namely Shadrach Minkins, the Jerry Rescue, and Anthony Burns. The fullness of time had come for a political party which would unite anti-slavery and abolitionists in a powerful political force. In abolitionist, Liberty, and Free Soil circles the name 'republican' had been bandied around for a number of years, with even Horace Greeley using the term as early as 1852, and is credited to christening the name republican in 1854. In addition, Israel Washburn, U.S. congressman from Maine, used the name Republican in reference to forming an anti-slavery party, there were private meetings in Crawfordsville, Iowa, Ripon, Wisconsin, Exeter, New Hampshire, and the convention in Jackson, Michigan, which all claim to have first named the party republican in 1854. Research completed by Mrs. Page Johnson in 1976, agrees with the column by R.F. Howard in 1903, that Edwin Hurlbut named the Republican Party in Madison, WI., July 13, 1854. Included in Mrs. Johnson's article is a photo of the Republican float in the bi-centennial parade in Oconomowoc in 1976, on which is displayed a replica of the handbill which Hurlbut distributed in June 1854, and added signage, \\"Hurlbut Named Party Republican\\". Later Alvan E. Bovay also claimed to have named the Republican Party in Ripon, Wisconsin, and is given credit and recognition for it by sign and literature, at the Little White Schoolhouse monument in Ripon. A statement to the effect of Bovay naming the party was made in 1900,The Daily Northwestern, The birth of the Republican Party, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, August 25, 1900, p.4 to which Col. Hurlbut responded by stating that he and Sherman Booth issued the call for a mass convention to establish a new political party without knowledge or reference to the meeting in Ripon. He further clarified his assessment of the meeting in Ripon: Two years later Hurlbut further defines the differences between the small inconspicuous meeting in Ripon, and the people's mass convention in Madison: Without Colonel Hurbut's call to this \\"more important place\\", the Republican Party would not have been born and christened in Wisconsin the summer of 1854. He wrote out the notice for a July convention, which was printed for four weeks in Sherman Booth's Milwaukee Free Democrat paper and other newspapers in the state. Three thousand delegates voted on the capital building steps in Madison on Hurlbut's proposed name of \\"Republican\\". Before this convention these delegates had been Whigs, Free Soil Party, Conservative Democrats, and members of the American Party. This event made the state Capital Square the birthplace of the party. Because the name \\"Republican\\" had been in common usage among anti-slavery and abolitionist groups throughout the North, one cannot attribute that word to any one person. There were likely many small groups, like the aforementioned ones in Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin and New Hampshire, who favored the name. These isolated groups were influencing and directing, and may have called themselves \\"Republican\\", but did not name the party. As pointed out by Colonel Hurlbut, the Ripon meeting consisted of Abolitionists, and the Republican Party platform he helped develop in Madison was not pro-abolition, but anti-slavery and anti-slavery expansion. It took more than disconnected local small groups with a common name and idea, but a notable person's issue of a statewide call for a convention, followed by hard work and presenting the name \\"Republican\\" to the people. This was the effort of Hurlbut, and the fruit of his effort was the platform and naming of the Republican Party on July 13, 1854, in Madison, Wisconsin. Death Hurlbut died on November 28, 1905 at his home in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin.

Operations are determined by a board of directors but the historical society is solely managed by the president, John Waite. The museum is a private, non-profit museum completely self-funded through various events and through philanthropists. Depot building Built in 1888, the depot was originally the property of the Detroit, Lansing and Northern Railroad and later the Pere Marquette Railroad, which was a merger of three Michigan-based railway systems beginning in the late 1800s. Eventually this system become part of the C&O; Railroad. The depot served Lake Odessa for over 82 years until the last tickets were sold to passengers in 1971. The building itself is not a large structure but it is important architecturally as it is the only Russian Ornate style building like this in the state of Michigan. In 1987 the railroad sold the depot to the historical society. The Depot consists of various rooms including a ticket office, a lobby which included both a ladies and a gentleman waiting rooms, and a baggage room. An interesting exhibit in the depot is a device constructed in the 1920s by Clair Goodsell. This periscope-like device would permit the user to peer into the water and see what they were dredging up. A restored Grand Trunk Caboose Freight station building Built in 2005 and reminiscent of the original freight station building, this building houses the main section of the museum. The building is also home to the Ionia County Genealogy Society and has an extensive library housing a wealth of information for anyone interested in their family history in this area. School room In the Freight Station building you will find a re-creation of a classroom from the original Lake Odessa High School. The high school, originally built in 1888, burned down and was rebuilt in 1921. This building was torn down in the 1990s but the historical society was able to retrieve several items from the building including the gymnasium scoreboard. Also in this room you will find a library commemorating the Lake Odessa High School's Library, the Grace Nichol Library - named in honor of a teacher who worked at the school. The library consists of an extensive collection of school text books from the 1860s to the 1980s – a wonderful reference accessible to anyone wishing to study education and its history. Native American history exhibit Surrounded by three lakes - Jordan Lake, Tupper Lake, and Augst Lake, early Native Americans made their summer dwellings in this area. Several tribes frequented the area including the Potowatomi, the Ottawa and the Ojibwe before white settlers arrived in the area around 1839. The historical society has many artifacts, maps, descriptions of the Native Americans' lifestyle, traditions, and homes. Bonanza exhibit Bonanza was a small town that was a predecessor of Lake Odessa. Started in the 1870s, Bonanza continued until the railroad was constructed and passed through the area that became known as Lake Odessa in 1888. Lake Odessa was about a half- mile to the south of Bonanza, but its proximity to the railway made it the ideal location for commerce. In order to be successful, merchants literally picked up their buildings and moved them into the town of Lake Odessa. The railroad's location and the development of the village of Lake Odessa put an end to the life of the town of Bonanza but laid a strong foundation for Lake Odessa when the businessmen of Bonanza moved to the meet the railroad. Notable items: Cornerstone from the Bonanza School, rocking chair that was brought into Ionia County in the 1930s by the Dexter Family who settled in the area. Farm exhibit This exhibit depicts the area's early agricultural history and includes farming implements, tools, and engines of many types. These numerous artifacts represent the methods of our agriculture in its early years.

Prisoner of War Exhibit From 1944 to 1945, a German POW camp was established in Lake Odessa to provide workers to the Lake Odessa Canning Company and the local farms. This exhibit is of both state and national importance. Although a few other states in our nation may have remnants of POW camp buildings or other structures to exhibit, actual artifacts of a POW camp are rare. In late 1944, five German POWs escaped from the camp and were recovered about 4 miles west of Lake Odessa. After their capture, a POW hat was found by a young boy. He then saved it and donated it a few years ago to the museum. When the US Army dismantled the camp in 1945, a few remnants remained and were salvaged by area residents, including a POW identification tag found by a young boy who explored the camp area after it was closed. Some notable items of interest in this display include a wooden mailbox, labeled Briefkasten (German for mailbox); a letter sent from Fort Custer, the parent camp of this camp; detailed information on Heinz Hanft – a former POW who returned to Europe after the war, and took his wife and family out of Germany to settle in Holland, Michigan.

McKinley placed his mask in front of his face during the argument, and the outfielder later said that he was struck in the face with the mask. McKinley said that he was simply shielding his face from Noren's spittle. McKinley made a controversial ruling in his final World Series. With Bob Gibson on the mound for the St. Louis Cardinals in the sixth inning of the second game in the 1964 World Series, McKinley ruled that a Gibson pitch hit Joe Pepitone of the New York Yankees. The Cardinals protested that the pitch first struck Pepitone's bat. Later in the inning, the Yankees took the lead and they ultimately won the game by a score of 8—3. However, the Cardinals won the World Series in seven games. In 1965, a mandatory retirement rule forced McKinley to end his umpiring career at the age of 55. Personal life In 1960, two men from Washington, DC attempted to extort money from McKinley and fellow umpire Ed Runge using a photo of the two umpires with two women in a motel room. The two Washington men and one of the women (a young dancer) were brought before a magistrate on extortion-related charges. In September of that season, at their own requests, Runge and McKinley were granted leaves of absence for the remainder of the season. Death McKinley died on August 1, 1980 in Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania.

Most of it originates from traditions (hadith and historical traditions), from pre- Islamic poetry, and from early biographical accounts or from conclusions from Qur'anic statements and the aforementioned sources. According to Islamic history sources, the first wife of Muhammad, Khadija, was a prosperous business woman who proposed to Muhammad (as opposed to being proposed to). They additionally say the wife of his chief-rival, Abu Sufyan (Hind), was politically active and was present at the Battle of Badr including conflicting accounts of her personally defiling the body of one of Muhammad's uncles.  Legal status and treatment Tribe Many assumptions have been made about pre-Islamic law due to discrepancies in the understanding of how law was enacted within the Arabian society. The main functional unit of the Arabian society, the tribe, was composed of those who had connections to a common relative. The tribe itself was tied together by a mutual understanding of spoken rules which could vary considerably depending on the tribe and its economic activities, including women's roles and rights. The rules were enforced by the tribal leader who also mediated the discussion of new laws. Individual men within the tribe were allowed to suggest new rules, but they would not be enacted until a consensus had been reached by the entire group. Many of these tribes were of patrilineal descent and therefore were only formed by male links traced down from each generation. In the tribal society, women generally had no right to dictate who they chose to marry. However, the tribe did offer the woman protection if she was maltreated by her husband. During the pre-Islamic times between 3500 and 3000 BCE, many of the city- states containing the individual tribes continually changed who had the authority to dictate. Much of this change occurred due to the tribal warfare taking place among these tribes. As the governmental power continued to be overturned and replaced, the laws towards women became more limiting as time went on. For some time husbands had the right to pawn their wives and children, beat them mercilessly, or pull their hair without being penalized for these actions. The only chief right a woman had during these times was stated in the Code of Hammurabi in 1752 BCE, \\"women could obtain a divorce only with great difficulty. If a woman so hated her husband, that she has declared, 'you may not have me', her record shall be investigated at her city council\\". The quote further goes on to state that if the court does not find the wife to be at fault, then she will be allowed to return to her father's home. Veiling During pre-Islamic times, the Assyrian law clearly depicted within their written regulation who was allowed to veil. Those women who were family to \\"seigniors\\" had to veil as well as those who were previously prostitutes but now married. Laws on veiling were so strict that intolerable consequences were enacted for these women, some of which included beating or cutting their ears off. Prostitutes and slaves were prohibited from veiling. The veil was not only used to classifying women according to their status, but it also labeled them based on their sexual activity and marital status. Women of upper class status While the general population, of women in pre-Islamic Arabia did not have many rights, upper-class women had more. Many became 'naditum', or priestesses, which would in turn give them even more rights. These women were able to own and inherit property. In addition, the naditum were able to play an active role in the economic life of their community. The Samad Late Iron Age population in central Oman show archaeologically women of both high and low social rank.. Marriage practices In pre-Islamic Arabia, a variety of different marriage practices existed. The most common and recognized types of marriage at this time consisted of: marriage by agreement, marriage by capture, marriage by purchase, marriage by inheritance and Mut'ah or temporary marriage.Shah, N. (2006). Women, The Koran and International Human Rights Law. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers. pp. 32. . Family structure and motherhood Research on the family structure of pre-Islamic Arabia has many ambiguous views so it becomes difficult to know the exact structure of the family during this time period. Family structure that may have been of a typical tribe during pre-Islamic Arabia was patriarchal and the relations in the family were between other relations with men. It was vital for families to have boys rather than girls because men were viewed as superior to women. Within the family the women did not have any parental rights over their children even if the father had died, and it is claimed that women had no rights of inheritance. However, it is clear that many widows were able to inherit from their husbands and were quite wealthy, Muhammad's wife Khadija and many other early widows of Islam included, before the surahs on inheritance were given. One of the most important roles of the mother within the household was for her to give birth to children, and to produce male offspring. Even though women had little rights within the household they did partake in few roles within society. Some of the activities the women did were making meals, milking animals, washing clothes, preparing butter, weaving material for tents, and spinning wool. During pre-Islamic Arabian times the child mortality rate was very high, and it was very common for parents to lose a child in infancy or during the child's childhood due to certain diseases and ailments .If the infant survived the community would hold a social feast in celebration of the infant's survival where they would name the child, and slaughter a sheep in honor of the child's birth. Children were not at fault for the same criminal punishments as adults. During this time period, it was seen as high importance for women to produce male offspring because they were seen as superior and also as the most fundamental component to be able to fight in the difficult desert conditions. Family planning was very important and certain aspects are put into place before anything takes course, but the family planning did not apply to everyone. People were concerned with circumstances that may impact their family and or the community. The process of planning the family structure is mutually between the husband and wife. An important aspect of the family structure is determining the number of children the mother has, and spacing out the pregnancies as a way to make sure the health of the mother and children are not at risk, and also strengthen the well-being of the family. People also enforced the importance of having the mother breast-feed, which was an infant's basic right for two years. Female infanticide Accusations of infanticide in the pre-Islamic era have been passed down through generations of Arabs legitimizing these actions; however, many of the allegations are unsubstantiated and arbitrary. There is a great deal of scholarly debate concerning the prevalence of infanticide, more specifically female infanticide in pre-Islamic Arabia. The pre-Islamic era, known as the age of Jahiliya, meaning the age of barbarism, darkness, and ignorance of God's guidance comes directly from the Quran (3:154, 5:50, 33:33, 48:26). Pre- Islamic era is the time before the birth of Muhammad and the rise of Islam. The absence of reliable historical sources and factual information, aside from Islamic traditionists' sources and stories, make ascertaining the truth about the pre-Islamic way of life and culture almost impossible to substantiate. Some scholars rely on the Quran and Hadith to gain information about pre- Islamic Arabia. Since there was no fully developed system of writing in Arabia during this time period, the sources are limited to traditions, legends, proverbs and above all to poems; most of which were not recorded in writing for an additional two to four hundred years later, during the second and third centuries of the Hijrah. In rare cases we find sources of infanticide recorded in Arabic poetry. Historically, the various cultural purposes of the practice of infanticide in other societies over time has been the reduction of population numbers, removal of defectives which includes babies with physical abnormalities and sick infants, elimination of social illegitimates, manipulation of sex ratio, or reactions to the loss of the mother during childbirth. Specifically, the Quran mentions the presence of infanticide in the Arabian society during Jahiliya. Infanticide in the Quran is referred to as \\"qatl al-awlad\\" which means killing children both males and females. Outside of the Quran, namely in the Hadith-literature, it includes broader actions like coitus interruptus, called \\"wad khafiyy\\" or hidden infanticide, and abortion known as \\"ijhad\\", as well as to kill a newborn whereby the practice to bury the infant alive so no blood was shed was considered humane and hence not murder. A description is given of digging a hole next to the mother and when she gives birth to an unwanted female child, although on occasion it might also be a male child, the newborn was directly buried in the hole). Other ways of committing infanticide have been mentioned in the fiqh collections, as well the hadith reports that include hurling infants off of cliffs and drowning them in wine and leaving them in the woods for wild animals. According to interpretations of the Quran, infanticide was a means for the prevention of poverty and considered to be solution for the liability of a female child. Some sources indicate that males were considered stronger in pagan tribal societies and females were an economic burden especially during times of famine because they were less useful. The father's disappointment and fear of the female being held captive by an opposing tribe which would bring shame to the family.

It later expanded to cover studios founded by former LucasArts employees, including Double Fine Productions, Telltale Games, Autumn Moon Entertainment and Crackpot Entertainment. It was founded in 1997 by James Spafford and is among the longest-running \\"fan sites\\" on the internet. Mixnmojo once enjoyed an active relationship with LucasArts, and reviews have occasionally been quoted in the company's marketing such as on the cover of the UK release of Monkey Island Special Edition Collection.Monkey Island: Special Edition Collection cover art! featuring a quote from The International House of Mojo The site was also referenced in the book Rogue Leaders: The Story of LucasArts, and staff has been interviewed by the gaming press. Developers highlighted by the site have often reciprocated its fondness. Tim Schafer of Double Fine Productions called Mixnmojo their \\"friendly friends\\" and praised the staff for their knowledge. At E3 2003, in order to make light of an extended downtime the site was experiencing, staffers in attendance playfully cajoled then-producer Dan Pettit of LucasArts into appearing in a video painting him as complicit in the site's technical woes. The site once even received permission from LucasArts to pull an elaborate April Fools prank that announced a fictional fifth Monkey Island installment (at the time, the series only had four games) complete with fake cover art and sound files of Dominic Armato performing dialog invented by the staff. Though created as an all-encompassing LucasArts site, Mixnmojo has always favored the studio's original titles, particularly its classic graphic adventure games, over the more popular Star Wars products. This at times strained the relationship with the company. As the site featured the unregulated opinions of its contributors rather a unified editorial point of view, it quickly established an endearingly quirky, if occasionally abrasive, tone in its editorials and news posts. After the turn of the century, LucasArts began shifting away from original properties and the adventure genre in particular, culminating in the cancellation of Sam & Max: Freelance Police in 2004. In response to this, Mixnmojo began broadening its coverage to include studios operated by LucasArts alumni that they believe continue the creative spirit abandoned by the original company. LucasArts was eventually shut down soon after Lucasfilm was purchased by Disney in 2012. Its oldest fan site remains active as an information hub for LucasArts legacy titles, which have remained topical due to their continued influence, remakes and re-releases, as well as a news source for games produced by key LucasArts alumni. The LF Network At its height, Mixnmojo cultivated a very active and diverse community of LucasArts fans and hosted a number of other sites directed at related franchises and itself belonged to the now defunct \\"LF Network.\\" Another prominent LFN site, The SCUMM Bar, dedicated to the Monkey Island series, also remains active. Staff members in the video game industry A number of former Mixnmojo staffers have gone on to have careers in the game industry, both in development and journalism. Jake Rodkin, Andrew Langley, Doug Tabacco and David Eggers even had stints at Telltale Games, during which they worked on Sam & Max and Monkey Island - franchises they once covered at Mixnmojo. Rodkin, who ultimately had a project leader role on a Sam & Max title, was the webmaster of a Sam & Max fan site hosted by LFN. Rodkin, Spafford and Chris Remo, who was an editor for the online magazine Adventure Gamers for several years, collaborated to launch Idle Thumbs in 2004.

After negotiations, the Netherlands signed the New York Agreement with Indonesia on 15 August 1962, relinquishing control of Western New Guinea to the United Nations.  Background  When the rest of the Dutch East Indies became fully independent as Indonesia in December 1949, the Dutch retained sovereignty over the western part of the island of New Guinea and took steps to prepare it for independence as a separate country. The Dutch and West Papuan leaders argued that the territory did not belong to Indonesia because the West Papuans were ethnically and geographically separated from Indonesians, had always been administrated separately, and that the West Papuans did not want to be under Indonesian control.Ron Crocombe, 282 From its independence in 1949 until 1961, Indonesia attempted to gain control of Western New Guinea through the United Nations without success. Since the Indonesian National Revolution, Indonesian nationalists had regarded Western New Guinea as an intrinsic part of the Indonesian state.Audrey and George McTurnan Kahin, p. 45 They also contended that Western New Guinea (Irian Barat) belonged to Indonesia and was being illegally occupied by the Dutch. Since 1954, Indonesia had sporadically launched military raids into Western New Guinea. Following the failure of negotiations at the United Nations, the president of Indonesia, Sukarno, escalated pressure on the Netherlands by nationalising Dutch-owned businesses and estates and repatriating Dutch nationals. These actions increased tensions between Indonesia and the Netherlands led to a sharp reduction in trade between the two countries. Following a sustained period of harassment of Dutch diplomats in Indonesia, Indonesia formally severed ties with the Netherlands in August 1960. Indonesia also increased its military pressure on Dutch New Guinea by purchasing weapons from the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. Over the following years, the Sukarno government would become dependent on Soviet military support.J.D. Legge, 402 On 19 December 1961, Sukarno decreed the establishment of the People's Triple Command or Tri Komando Rakyat (Trikora) in order to annex what Indonesia called West Irian by 1 January 1963. Trikora's operational command was to be called the Mandala Command for the Liberation of West Irian (Komando Mandala Pembebasan Irian Barat) with Major-General Suharto (the future President of Indonesia) serving as its commander. In preparation for the planned invasion, the Mandala command began making land, air, and sea incursions into West Irian.Bilveer Singh, West Irian and the Suharto Presidency, p.86 As a result, Indonesia began a policy of confronting the Dutch over control of Western New Guinea. Sukarno also embarked on a policy of \\"progressive mobilization\\" to prepare the nation to carry out his commands.Soedjati Djiwandono, p. 131 While the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia sided with the Netherlands' claims to Western New Guinea and were opposed to Indonesian expansionism, they were unwilling to commit military support to the Dutch. The Netherlands was unable to find sufficient international support for its New Guinea policy. By contrast, Sukarno was able to muster the support of the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies, and the Non-Aligned Movement. In response to Indonesian claims, the Netherlands to sped up the process of implementing West Papuan self-rule from 1959 onward. These measures included the establishment of a legislative New Guinea Council in 1960, establishing hospitals, completion of a shipyard in Manokwari, development of agricultural research sites and plantations; and the creation of the Papuan Volunteer Corps to defend the territory.Wies Platje, 297–299J.D. Legge, 403  Preparation   Military  Indonesia began seeking weapons from abroad in response to the conflict with the Netherlands. Having failed to secure anything from the United States, General Nasution went to Moscow in December 1960 to negotiate what eventually turned out to be a US$2.5 Billion arms package with the Soviet government. The subsequent deliveries that arose from this deal led the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) to boast that Indonesia had the strongest air force in the southern hemisphere. The United States did not support the surrender of West Irian to Indonesia, since the Bureau of European Affairs considered it an act of trading one occupying power for another. However, in April 1961, Robert Komer and McGeorge Bundy began to prepare plans for the United Nations to give the impression that surrender to Indonesia was legal. Although reluctantly, President John F. Kennedy finally supported these plans, fearing that, without U.S support, the Indonesians would become further entrenched into the Soviet-bloc. Indonesia bought various kinds of military equipment, including 41 Mi-4 and nine Mi-6 helicopters, 30 MiG-15, 49 MiG-17, ten MiG-19 and 20 MiG-21 fighter jets, 12 Whiskey-class submarines, 12 Komar-class missile boats, and one ex-Soviet Navy Sverdlov- class cruiser which was renamed the KRI Irian). Of the types of bombers, there were 22 Ilyushin Il-28 light bombers, 14 TU-16 long-range medium bombers, and 12 maritime versions of TU-16 aircraft equipped to launch the AS-1 Kennel anti-ship missiles. Of the types of transport aircraft, there were 26 IL-14 and AQvia-14 light transport aircraft, six Antonov An-12 heavy transports, and ten C-130 Hercules tactical transport aircraft.  Airbases  To achieve air superiority, the first preparations undertaken by the AURI were to repair war-damaged airbases, which would be used for infiltration operations and normal operations on the West Irian mainland. Air bases and landing strips which were common along the borders of Maluku and West Irian, were relics of imperial Japanese presence. Such airbases and landing strips were last used in 1945, and had since fallen into disrepair. Soviet involvement Soviet support of Indonesia played a crucial role in ending the conflict over New Guinea. Due to the support of Soviet submarines and bombers, Indonesian military forces could confidently launch an attack on Dutch troops. In response to Soviet presence, the United States put pressure on the Netherlands to relinquish control of West Papua. At the height of the Cold War, it was strategically critical that Indonesia remain outside the U.S.S.R's sphere of influence, which made the U.S willing to take action to ensure a neutral or friendly relationship with Indonesia. By enforcing the transfer of New Guinea, the United States could keep the regime of Sukarno friendly, despite not supporting the Netherlands which eventually gave way to American pressure and the threat of an attack on New Guinea. The Soviet support was secret - the \\"volunteers\\" wearing Indonesian uniforms - however, the Indonesian Foreign Minister Soebandrio let the Russian willingness to actively provide military support leak to the American ambassador in Jakarta, according to Khrushchev’s memoirs.Nikita Khrushchev, Memoirs of Nikita Khrushchev: Volume 3: Statesman (1953-1964), ed.

Asser Press, 21 Jul 2017, page 91 Naval officer and Historian Matthijs Ooms has shown in his masterpaper that the Dutch naval intelligence service, MARID (Marine Inlichtingendienst), received information in the summer of 1962 that Soviet crews were manning Indonesian submarines and Tupolev bombers.Matthijs Ooms, “Geheime Sovjetsteun in Nieuw-Guinea”, Marineblad, Vol. 122, No. 5 (2012), 26.https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/45249388/Active_Soviet_military_support_for_Indonesia_during_1962_West_Irian_Crisis.docx In his memoirs, Nikita Khrushchev freely admitted that during the West New Guinea crisis Soviet personnel had been commanding Indonesian submarines and piloting TU-16s.  Diplomacy  Indonesia approached countries like India, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, United Kingdom, Germany, and France to ensure that those countries would not support the Netherlands in a potential Dutch-Indonesian conflict. In the United Nations General Assembly in 1961, the UN Secretary General U Thant asked Ellsworth Bunker, an American diplomat, to submit proposals on solving the problem of the status of West Irian. Bunker proposed that the Netherlands submit West Irian to Indonesia through the United Nations within a period of 2 years.  Economy  On December 27, 1958, President Sukarno issued Law No. 86 of 1958 concerning the nationalization of all Dutch companies in Indonesia. Nationalized companies included: # Plantation companies # Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij # Electricity companies # Petroleum companies # Hospital (CBZ) becomes RSCM While other policies were implemented, including: # Moving the Indonesian tobacco auction market to Bremen,West Germany # Dutch workers strike in Indonesia # Prohibiting KLM (a Dutch airline) from entering Indonesian airspace # Prohibiting the screening of Dutch films  General Strategy  In accordance with the development of the Trikora situation, instructions were given by the Commander in Chief of the Highest Commodity of Liberation of West Irian No. 1 to the Commander of the Mandala, which were the following: * Plan, prepare and conduct military operations with the aim of returning the territory of West Irian to the Republic of Indonesia. * Developing the situation in the Province of West Irian in accordance with the struggle in the field of diplomacy and in the shortest possible time in the West Irian Region creating de facto regions of Indonesian control. Strategies developed by the Commander of Mandala to carry out these instructions included: * Infiltration (until the end 1962), namely by deploying infantry units around certain targets to create a strong de facto free area that is resistant to destruction by the enemy and to develop territorial control by unifying the local populace. * Exploitation (early 1963), namely carrying out an open attack on the enemy military host and occupying all important enemy defense posts. * Consolidation (early 1964), namely by demonstrating the power and absolute sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia throughout West Irian.  Indonesian military operations  The disputed territory of West New Guinea In 1962, Indonesian incursions into the territory in the form of paratroop drops and the naval landings of guerrillas were used to step up Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio's diplomatic confrontation with the Dutch. Operation Trikora was to unfold in three phases: infiltration, exploitation and consolidation, all under cover of the Indonesian Air Force. The plan called first for the insertion of small bands of Indonesian troops by sea and by airdrop, who would then draw Dutch forces away from areas where the exploitation phase would stage full-scale amphibious landings and paratroop operations to seize key locations. The consolidation phase would then expand Indonesian control over the whole of Western New Guinea. On 15 January 1962, the infiltration phase of Operation Trikora began when four Indonesian Navy motor torpedo boats attempted to land a unit of 150 marines on the south coast of New Guinea near Vlakke Hoek. The force was detected by a Dutch Lockheed P2V-7B Neptune aircraft and the Indonesian boats were intercepted by three Dutch destroyers. During the subsequent Battle of Arafura Sea, one Indonesian boat was sunk and two others were badly damaged and forced to retreat. Thus, this planned Indonesian amphibious landing ended disastrously with many crew members and marines being killed, among them Commodore Yos Sudarso, the Deputy Chief of the Indonesian Navy Staff. Some 55 survivors were captured. Over the next eight months, the Indonesian forces managed to insert 562 troops by sea and 1,154 by air drops. The inserted Indonesian troops conducted guerrilla operations throughout Western New Guinea from April 1962 onwards, but they were largely militarily ineffective. At least 94 Indonesian soldiers were killed and 73 were wounded during the hostilities. By contrast, the Dutch suffered only minimal casualties. Indonesian military activity continued to increase in the area through mid-1962 in preparation for the second phase of the operation. The Indonesian Air Force began to fly missions in the area from bases on surrounding islands, with Soviet-supplied Tupolev Tu-16 bombers armed with KS-1 Komet anti-ship missiles deployed in anticipation of an attack against the . By the summer of 1962, the Indonesian military had begun planning a large-scale amphibious and air assault against Biak, the Netherlands' main power base in West Irian. This operation would have been known as Operation Jayawijaya (\\"Victory over Imperialism\\") and would have included a substantial task force of 60 ships including several which had been supplied by Sukarno's Soviet and Eastern Bloc allies. On 13 and 14 August 1962, air drops of Indonesian troops were staged from Sorong in the northwest to Merauke in the southeast as a diversion for an amphibious assault against the Dutch military base at Biak Island by a force of 7,000 Army (RPKAD) and Air Force (PASGAT) paratroopers, 4,500 marines and 13,000 army servicemen, from various military districts (KODAMs). However, the Dutch Navy's Marid 6 Netherlands New Guinea (Marid 6 NNG) signals intelligence section and Neptune aircraft detected the invasion force and alerted their command. According to Wies Platje, the Royal Netherlands Navy was responsible for the defence of Western New Guinea. In 1962, the Dutch naval presence in New Guinea consisted of five anti-submarine destroyers, two frigates, three submarines, one survey vessel, one supply ship and two oil tankers. Dutch air power in Western New Guinea consisted of eleven Lockheed P2V-7B Neptune aircraft from the Royal Netherlands Navy plus 24 Hawker Hunter jet fighters from the Royal Netherlands Air Force. In addition, Dutch ground forces consisted of several anti-aircraft artillery units, five Royal Netherlands Marine Corps companies and three Royal Netherlands Army infantry battalions. As part of the planned defence, the Dutch had considered using Marid 6 NNG to disrupt the Indonesian military's communication systems.  Aftermath  The Sukarno-era \\"West Irian Liberation Statue\\" in Jakarta On 15 August 1962, the Netherlands recognized Indonesia's resolve to take Western New Guinea. Since it was unwilling to be drawn into a protracted conflict on the other side of the world, the Dutch government signed the New York Agreement, which handed the colony to an interim United Nations administration. Consequently, Operation Jayawijaya was called off and Western New Guinea was officially annexed by Indonesia in 1963. The Dutch decision to hand over Western New Guinea to Indonesia had been influenced by its main ally, the United States. While the Netherlands was a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and thus an ally of the Americans, the Kennedy Administration was unwilling to antagonize Indonesia since it was trying to court President Sukarno away from the Soviet orbit. The Indonesian military's incursions into West Irian, plus the substantial Soviet military assistance to the Indonesian military, had convinced the United States government to pressure the Dutch to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict.Soedjati Djiwandono, Konfrontasi Revisited, p. 135. The New York Agreement was the result of negotiations that were spearheaded by the American diplomat Ellsworth Bunker. As a face-saving measure for the Dutch, Bunker arranged for a Dutch-Indonesian ceasefire which would be followed by the handover of Western New Guinea on 1 October to a temporary United Nations Temporary Executive Authority (UNTEA). On 1 May 1963, Indonesia formally annexed Western New Guinea. As part of the New York Agreement, it was stipulated that a popular plebiscite, called the Act of Free Choice, would be held in 1969 to determine whether the West Papuans would choose to remain in Indonesia or seek self-determination.J.D. Legge, 403–404 However, American efforts to win over Sukarno proved futile and Indonesia turned its attention to the former British colony of Malaysia, resulting in the Indonesian- Malaysian Confrontation. Ultimately, President Sukarno was overthrown during the Indonesian coup d'état in 1965 and was replaced by the pro-Western Suharto. The American mining company Freeport-McMoRan began exploiting Western New Guinea's copper and gold deposits.Ron Crocombe, 285 Following the Act of Free Choice plebiscite in 1969, West Papua was formally integrated into the Republic of Indonesia. Instead of a referendum of the 816,000 Papuans, they were represented by 1,022 Papuan tribal representatives for the vote. While several international observers including journalists and diplomats criticized the referendum as being rigged, the United States and Australia supported Indonesia's efforts to secure acceptance in the United Nations for the pro- integration vote. In all, 84 member states voted in favor for the United Nations to accept the result, with 30 others abstaining.Ron Crocombe, 284 Due to the Netherlands' efforts to promote a West Papuan national identity, a significant number of West Papuans refused to accept the territory's integration into Indonesia. These formed the separatist Organisasi Papua Merdeka (Free Papua Movement) and have waged an insurgency against the Indonesian authorities, which still continues to this day.Ron Crocombe, 286-91 References Bibliography  Category:1961 in Netherlands New Guinea Category:1962 in Netherlands New Guinea Category:Military operations involving Indonesia Category:Military operations involving the Netherlands Category:Netherlands New Guinea Category:Western New Guinea ","title":"Operation Trikora"},{"id":"33908812","text":"Major General Anthony Arthur Milton, (born 19 August 1949) is a retired Royal Marines officer who served as Commandant General Royal Marines from 2002 to 2004.

Collins was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm off break. He was born at Clayton, Manchester, Lancashire. Lancashire Collins joined the Lancashire Cricket Federation in its foundation year. He made his first-class debut for Lancashire in the County Championship against Hampshire at the United Services Recreation Ground in Portsmouth in August 1954. Even before making his first class debut, Collins had acted as the de facto twelfth man for England against Pakistan in the Old Trafford Test that started on 22 July 1954. Jim Parks had been chosen as the twelfth man. But when Frank Lowson got injured, Parks played and Collins acted as the emergency fielder. At this point, Collins had played for the Lancashire senior team only in a two day match against North Wales. From 1954 to 1962, Collins made 119 first-class appearances for Lancashire, with his final appearance coming in the 1962 County Championship against Sussex. He also played for the Lancashire Second XI during this period, who themselves played at that time in the Minor Counties Championship, thereby allowing Collins to represent a combined Minor Counties team against the touring South Africans in 1960, a match in which he scored 96 runs in the Minor Counties first-innings. Somerset at the Recreation Ground in 1961, Collins was awarded his county cap A hard hitting all- rounder with a reputation for quick scoring, Collins scored a total of 3,332 runs in his 119 first-class appearances for Lancashire, which came at an average of 20.44 and a high score of 107 not out. This score was one of two first-class centuries he made, alongside eight half centuries for the county. An able off spiner, Collins took 159 wickets at a bowling average of 30.70, with best figures of 6.63. These figures, one of four five wicket hauls he took, came in his best season with Lancashire in 1961. His figures of 6/63 came against Sussex on a drying first-innings wicket at Old Trafford. In the following match he scored his unbeaten 107 against Somerset at the Recreation Ground, Bath, after he was awarded his county cap. He made another century in that season, scoring a total of 858 runs at an average of 26.00, while with the ball he took 52 wickets at an average of 29.73, with that season including three of his four career five wicket hauls. He also took twice as many wickets in that season as he had in any other. The 1962 season was to be his last with Lancashire, with Collins striking 25 sixes in that season. Cheshire He joined Cheshire in 1963, making his debut for the county against Staffordshire in the Minor Counties Championship. He played Minor counties cricket intermittently for Cheshire until 1973, making a total of 49 appearances. He had left Lancashire a season before List A cricket was introduced, a format which would have suited his hard hitting batting style. He made his List A debut for Cheshire against Surrey in the 1st round of the 1964 Gillette Cup at the Ellerman Lines Cricket Ground in Hoylake. Collins top scored in Cheshire's innings with 58, before being dismissed by Michael Willett. Surrey won the match by 62 runs. He made a second List A appearance in the 1966 Gillette Cup against his former county at the Macclesfield Cricket Club Ground, scoring a single run before he was dismissed by Peter Lever, with Lancashire winning by 42 runs. Personal life Outside of county cricket, Collins played in the Lancashire League for Haslingden in 1959 and Lowerhouse from 1959 to 1968. He also played club cricket for Leek Cricket Club in Staffordshire and for Blackburn Cricket Club and Rochdale, both in Lancashire. In his forties he played for Didsbury as an amateur, later being invited to become first the chairman, then President of the club. His affection for cricket continued long after his retirement from the game, with Collins working alongside the Manchester Education Committee in setting up an indoor cricket school in Withington, which was one of the first of its kind and was used by both Lancashire and England players. He worked as a residential cricket coach for the Manchester Education Committee for 32 years. In his early years he worked for a textile company, before setting up an insurance brokers company with his wife Doris, who was the sister of Lancashire, Surrey, Worcestershire & Warwickshire cricketer and professional footballer Jim Cumbes. He continued to coach cricket well into his final years, advising schools and clubs in the Manchester area. He died suddenly on 5 November 2009.

Species These species are called aspens: *Populus adenopoda – Chinese aspen (China, south of P. tremula) *Populus davidiana – Korean aspen (Eastern Asia) *Populus grandidentata – Bigtooth aspen (eastern North America, south of P. tremuloides) *Populus sieboldii – Japanese aspen (Japan) *Populus tremula – Eurasian aspen (northern Europe and Asia) *Populus tremuloides – Quaking aspen or trembling aspen (northern and western North America) Habitat and longevity trembling aspen Aspen trees are all native to cold regions with cool summers, in the north of the northern hemisphere, extending south at high-altitude areas such as mountains or high plains. They are all medium-sized deciduous trees reaching tall. In North America, the aspen is referred to as quaking aspen or trembling aspen because the leaves \\"quake\\" or tremble in the wind. This is due to their flattened petioles which reduces aerodynamic drag on the trunk and branches. Aspen trees near Crested Butte, Colorado Aspens typically grow in environments that are otherwise dominated by coniferous tree species, and which are often lacking other large deciduous tree species. Aspens have evolved several adaptations that aid their survival in such environments. One is the flattened leaf petiole, which reduces aerodynamic drag during high winds and decreases the likelihood of trunk or branch damage. Dropping leaves in the winter (like most but not all other deciduous plants) also helps to prevent damage from heavy winter snow. Additionally, the bark is photosynthetic, meaning that growth is still possible after the leaves have been dropped. The bark also contains lenticels that serve as pores for gas exchange (similar to the stomata on leaves). Aspens are also aided by the rhizomatic nature of their root systems. Most aspens grow in large clonal colonies, derived from a single seedling, and spread by means of root suckers; new stems in the colony may appear at up to from the parent tree. Each individual tree can live for 40–150 years above ground, but the root system of the colony is long-lived. In some cases, this is for thousands of years, sending up new trunks as the older trunks die off above ground. For this reason, it is considered to be an indicator of ancient woodlands. One such colony in Utah, given the nickname of \\"Pando\\", has been estimated to be as old as 80,000 years, Quaking Aspen by the Bryce Canyon National Park Service if validated, this would be making it possibly the oldest living colony of aspens. Some aspen colonies become very large with time, spreading about per year, eventually covering many hectares. They are able to survive forest fires, because the roots are below the heat of the fire, and new sprouts appear after the fire burns out. The high stem turnover rate combined with the clonal growth leads to proliferation in aspen colonies. The high stem turnover regime supports a diverse herbaceous understory. Aspen seedlings do not thrive in the shade, and it is difficult for seedlings to establish in an already mature aspen stand. Fire indirectly benefits aspen trees, since it allows the saplings to flourish in open sunlight in the burned landscape, devoid of other competing tree species. Aspens have increased in popularity as a forestry cultivation species, mostly because of their fast growth rate and ability to regenerate from sprouts. This lowers the cost of reforestation after harvesting since no planting or sowing is required. Recently, aspen populations have been declining in some areas (\\"Sudden Aspen Death\\"). This has been attributed to several different factors, such as climate change, which exacerbates drought and modifies precipitation patterns. Recruitment failure from herbivory or grazing prevents new trees from coming up after old trees die. Additionally, successional replacement by conifers due to fire suppression alters forest diversity and creates conditions where aspen may be at less of an advantage. In contrast with many trees, aspen bark is base-rich, meaning aspens are important hosts for bryophytesThe Biodiversity and Management of Aspen woodlands: Proceedings of a one-day conference held in Kingussie, Scotland, on 25th May 2001 and act as food plants for the larvae of butterfly (Lepidoptera) species—see List of Lepidoptera that feed on poplars. Young aspen bark is an important seasonal forage for the European hare and other animals in early spring. Aspen is also a preferred food of the European beaver. Elk, deer, and moose not only eat the leaves but also strip the bark with their front teeth. Image gallery File:Large-toothed aspen leaf (Grasett Twp).JPGLeaf of Populus grandidentata.

Uses Aspen wood is white and soft, but fairly strong, and has low flammability. It has a number of uses, notably for making matches and paper where its low flammability makes it safer to use than most other woods. Shredded aspen wood is used for packing and stuffing, sometimes called excelsior (wood wool). Aspen flakes are the most common species of wood used to make oriented strand boards. It is also a popular animal bedding, since it lacks the phenols associated with pine and juniper, which are thought to cause respiratory system ailments in some animals. Heat- treated aspen is a popular material for the interiors of saunas. While standing trees sometimes tend to rot from the heart outward, the dry timber weathers very well, becoming silvery-grey and resistant to rotting and warping, and has traditionally been used for rural construction in the northwestern regions of Russia (especially for roofing, in the form of thin slats).

In November 2011 he made a notable contribution to the Leveson Inquiry where he not only confessed to a wide range of illegal activities in the pursuit of news but defended them as necessary. In his testimony he opposed the concept of privacy, despite claiming his own personal privacy being compromised, and that he had long disguised his personal whereabouts and circumstances, primarily by registering himself (for various purposes) at his parents' home address.BBC News: Leveson Inquiry: Editors 'knew phones were hacked' 29 November 2011 (Retrieved 29 Nov 2011) McMullan notably told the enquiry that \\"Privacy is for paedos\\". McMullan testified to having undertaken a wide range of illegal or unethical activities to get stories besides phone hacking: bribing police officers, stealing documents, going through celebrities' rubbish bins, and at one point posing as a \\"teenage rent boy\\" to entrap a paedophile priest. \\"[I]t was hard to think of any dubious news- gathering technique he had not confessed to,\\" wrote New York Times reporter Sarah Lyall, \\"short of pistol-whipping sources for information.\\" He defended those techniques as \\"perfectly acceptable ... if all we're trying to do is get at the truth.\\" \\"[Do] we really want to live in a world where the only people who can do the hacking are MI5 and MI6?\\" he asked. \\"For a brief period of about 20 years, we have actually lived in a free society where we can hack back\\". He scoffed at the very notion of privacy, calling it \\"the space bad people need to do bad things in.\\" Lyall commented, \\"At times he sounded like a satirist's rendition of an amoral tabloid hack\\".\\" More recently, McMullan has been a freelance journalist. He often works in Kent with KOS Media titles, including the Kent on Sunday paper. Pub owner and politician McMullan owns several properties in Kent, giving his address as the Castle Inn, Dover, when appearing at the Leveson inquiry. In January 2011, McMullan became the landlord of The Bull public house in the village of Eastry for Punch Taverns. McMullan employed a bar manager to run the pub. After residents' complaints about noise from the pub he handed in his resignation as leaseholder. The bar manager took over and the pub was under investigation by Dover District Council and Kent Police before it closed completely. McMullan owns and runs The Castle Inn, a public house near the Port of Dover, Kent.yeah-cameron- murdoch Grant, Hugh (2011) The bugger, bugged, The New Statesman, 12 April (Retrieved 29 Nov 2011) In August 2011, he tried to apply for a licence for topless barmaids in the pub. This was later refused. As part of The Castle Inn, McMullan opened a low budget hostel called Dover Backpackers, providing accommodation in dormitory-style. He stood as an independent in the 2013 Kent County Council elections for the Dover Town Ward. He originally wanted to stand as a UKIP candidate but was not supported by the party. He came third behind the Conservatives and Labour. Personal life McMullan is the father of four children, the first two from his former marriage to former News of The World journalist Maria McMullan, and the two younger children are from a more recent relationship with a Kent local newspaper editor. McMullan is often filmed and interviewed at his pub by TV companies from all over the world including Turkey, India, Europe and Australia about phone hacking and journalism. He has written a book about the News of the World phone hacking and other practices at the paper.

Her grass-roots activism helped to sustain the long boycott and inspired similar groups to begin raising money.Gingrich, Jessica, The Underground Kitchen That Funded the Civil Rights Movement, Atlas Obscura, December 31, 2018 Background Gilmore worked as a midwife in Montgomery where she lived with her six children. Although described as kind and motherly, Gilmore was also known for her fiery temper, especially in response to the racial injustices so common in Alabama during the 1950s. She would resist discrimination on buses and even confronted white men in the community if they mistreated her or her family. Gilmore also worked at the National Lunch Company in Montgomery as a cook until the bus boycott began in late 1955. Bus Boycott After Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to leave her seat on December 1, 1955, the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) declared a boycott of the bus system beginning on December 5. Gilmore, who had already refused to use the buses in Montgomery, heard of the arrest on the news and quickly joined the new Montgomery Improvement Association; this is when the boycott began. Gilmore's involvement in the boycott along with her vocal contempt for discriminatory white bus drivers resulted in her being fired from the National Lunch Company, but this only increased her participation within the MIA and the boycott later saying, \\"this new generation had decided that they just had taken as much as they could.\\" Following her dismissal from the Lunch Company, Martin Luther King, Jr. (who lived nearby) and other MIA leaders helped Gilmore set up her own restaurant in her home as a way for her to make a living. It was then that she began the boycott fund-raising effort that she called \\"the Club from Nowhere\\". Club from Nowhere Georgia Gilmore stated that \\"what we could do best was cook\\" and so, with a group of friends, began making sandwiches to sell at the mass meetings for the boycott and the MIA. The success of this venture led Gilmore and her friends to produce entire meals, including chicken dinners, cakes, and pies to sell to the boycotters. The money from these sales went toward helping the Montgomery Improvement Association and to sustain the boycott for as long as possible. Gilmore dubbed her group \\"the Club from Nowhere\\" to ensure the anonymity of the members as well as contributors (some of whom were white). In an effort to avoid any conflict, Gilmore established herself as the only officer in the Club from Nowhere; members gave her all the money they made, which she then passed to the leaders of the MIA at weekly mass meetings. The club soon began raising hundreds of dollars a week by selling their meals out of beauty parlors, laundromats, and other locations frequented by both boycotters and supporters of the movement and they would present their weekly gains at the meetings to the applause of the audience. Gilmore hoped that the success of the group had encouraged other \\"ordinary folks\\" to do the same. This organization and others like it are cited by some as what kept the boycott alive by providing money as well as grass-roots support within the community. Significance Gilmore and the Club from Nowhere show how the extensive efforts of African-American women aided and sustained the bus boycott, both in their financial contributions and in their commitment to the boycott itself. The club prompted the creation of a sister organization (called the Friendly Club) that also helped fund-raising for the MIA. Her son Mark later stated that she had \\"elevated her day-to-day work—doing the cooking—into something greater.\\" In a 1986 interview, Gilmore credited African-American women with being a driving force behind the boycott's success, saying, \\"you see they were maids, cooks. And they was the one that really and truly kept the bus running.\\" Aftermath Gilmore participated in the Eyes on the Prize documentary and her famous recipes still appear in cookbooks. While making food for commemorators at the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Selma March, she died on March 7, 1990.

Solanum evolvuloides belongs to section Gonatotrichum, a small group assigned to the Brevantherum clade of the genus Solanum. It resembles Solanum turneroides Chodat, sharing with it heterandry, and Solanum parcistrigosum Bitter, with which it shares a similar habit and pubescence. Despite these similarities, the species can be recognized by its ovate-elliptic to cordiform leaf shape and more membranaceous leaf texture than the other species in the section, and stem, inflorescence axes, and calyx vestiture mainly composed of glandular hairs. Solanum evolvuloides is known to occur only in southeastern of Bahia state, Brazil, and in a preliminary assessment of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria can be considered a threatened species.  Description  Herbs, slightly woody to woody at base, few- to many-branched, 20–40 cm tall. Stems moderately to densely pubescent with multicelled unbranched erect glandular hairs ca. 0.3–0.5 mm long, these mixed with less frequent slightly longer 1–3-celled unbranched eglandular hairs. Sympodial units defoliate, solitary or more commonly geminate, the smaller leaves up to half the size of the larger ones. Leaves simple, the blades 1–4 × 1–3 cm, ovate-elliptic to cordiform, chartaceous to membranaceous, sparsely to moderately pubescent on both sides with 1–2-celled unbranched erect eglandular hairs, these denser on the primary and secondary veins; venation camptodromous, with the primary and one pair of secondary veins emerging from the leaf base (sometimes just one, in the case of an asymmetric base), the primary and secondary veins barely visible to the naked eye, slightly prominent abaxially and less visible adaxially; base attenuate to cordate, slightly decurrent into petiole; margins entire, ciliate with hairs like those of the blade; apex acute to attenuate; petioles 0.5–2.2 cm long, with pubescence similar to that of the stems but with fewer eglandular hairs. Inflorescencessessile, lateral, extra-axillary or subopposite the leaves, unbranched, with 1–4 flowers, the axes with pubescence like that of the stems; peduncles absent; rachis very short; pedicels 6–10 mm in flower, 7–14 mm in fruit, almost contiguous, articulated at the base. Flowers 5-merous. Calyx 2–7 mm long, the tube 1–2 mm, the lobes 2–6 × 1–2.6 mm, ovate-elliptic, the apex acuminate, moderately pubescent abaxially with almost exclusively glandular unbranched multicellular erect hairs, densely pubescent adaxially with very small glandular hairs with 1-celled stalks; calyx accrescent in fruit, the lobes up to 8 mm long, equal to or exceeding the berry at maturity. Corolla 1–2.5 (-3) cm in diameter, rotate with abundant interpetalar tissue, membranaceous, white, the lobes 2–4 × 1–3 mm, triangular, acute at apex, with a few eglandular hairs abaxially, mainly on the central part of each lobe, glabrous adaxially. Stamens 4–9.5 mm long; filaments 1–2 mm long, with one much longer than the others, up to 5 mm long, glabrous; anthers 4–6 × 1.3–2 mm, connivent, yellow, the base cordate, with a small bulge dorsally, the apex emarginate, the pores directed introrsely and subapically, not opening into longitudinal slits. Ovary glabrous; style 7–9 mm long, longer than the smaller stamens, cylindrical, glabrous, curved near apex, closely appressed to the larger stamen; stigma capitate. Fruits 0.8–1.5 cm in diameter, globose berries, greenish white when immature, translucent at maturity, drying light-brown to blackish, glabrous, the mesocarp watery and held under pressure, dehiscing explosively at maturity, normally between two calyx lobes. Seeds 10–25 per fruit, 2.5–3.6 × 1.8–2.9 mm, flattened, reniform, with a small hollow where connected to the placenta, the margin flattened, forming a winged projection, the seed surface with raised projections and grooves parallel to margin, giving a netlike impression.  Distribution  This species is known only from the southeastern part of Bahia state, Brazil, occurring in the transition zone between deciduous forests and xeric formations of shrubby Caatinga (as defined by Velloso et al. 2002). See Distribution Map.  Ecology  Solanum evolvuloideswas recently recollected by the first author in the municipality of Jequié in a typical shrubby Caatinga formation, that is associated in this region with large granitic outcrops. The occurrence on the banks of the Rio de Contas near the city of Itacaré [Jardim, J.G. 1843 (CEPEC)] might be an occasional case of water dispersal by the river, which arises in a xeric environment near the center of the state in the Caatinga biome. Despite having been found in environments with marked seasonality, the species is apparently not annual, as evidenced by the woody stem bases.  Etymology  The name Solanum evolvuloides evokes the strong resemblance of this species to a sympatric species of the genus Evolvulus (Convolvulaceae).  Phenology  Flowering and fruiting material has been collected between February and August, with a flowering peak from February to May; fruiting specimens were collected from June to August. Under cultivation, flowers were observed to open only in the morning, closing during the evening. Observations of the same flower during consecutive days confirmed this pattern.  Preliminary conservation status  Endangered (EN) B1 a, b (i, ii, iii, iv). Solanum evolvuloides is known from only two localities, where the landscape has been strongly modified in the last decades due to the expansion of urban centers and extensive farming. The region has been focus of several surveys undertaken by the CEPEC group, in association with the New York Botanical Garden; despite this, only a few collections of this species have been made. Although one collection was made in a very disturbed area (Jardim 1843), the most recent collection is from a well-preserved forest fragment, and the species was not found in surrounding areas. There are no collections from within conservation units.  References  * Leandro L.

He is known as a businessman, who developed a major footwear manufacturing, tannery, and retailer in Adelaide. Early life and education Alexander Dowie was born in 1828 as the third son of John Dowie (26 November 1800 – c. 1832) and his wife Margaret (born 1 August 1802). His family included a younger brother, John Murray Dowie. His father and sister died when Alexander was around four years old. Later the boy lived in Portobello, Scotland, where he was apprenticed to learn the trade of bootmaker. Marriage and emigration to South Australia In April 1851 Dowie married Jane Cockburn (c. 1831 – 28 October 1910) and they emigrated to South Australia on the Blundell in May that year, partly sponsored by Caroline Chisholm. They arrived at Adelaide in August. He joined the gold rush to Mount Alexander, but soon returned to Adelaide, opening a bootmaker's shop and factory (\\"South Australian Boot Factory\\") This article contains useful details of the boot manufacturing trade in Rundle Street. He had his businesses in buildings at the far end of the street, then moved closer to the center, at numbers 69 and then 63. He also opened a tannery in Bowden. In 1904 Dowie transferred his business to sons Norman and (Charles) Stuart; they sold it to A. W. Barlow and Co. in 1908. His brother John Murray Dowie had followed him from Scotland to South Australia, immigrating there in 1860. His son John Alexander Dowie worked for a time in his uncle's bootmaking business. After studying theology in Edinburgh, the younger John A. Dowie returned to Australia and started serving as a minister. He married Dowie's daughter Jane. They had a family. After serving as a conventional minister, JA Dowie built a huge following for his faith healing ministry. He immigrated with his family in 1888 to San Francisco, California in the United States. By 1893 he settled in Chicago (in time for the World's Fair that year). After building his faith healing business, in 1901 he bought land and founded Zion City in Illinois, about 40 miles north of the city. He owned all the property. Alexander was a friend of John Darling, and influenced him to also emigrate to South Australia. They continued to associate: Darling hired at least one of the Dowie boys, the two families worshipped at the same church, and two Darling boys married daughters of Dowie. Dowie was appointed President of the Board of Conciliation, serving from 1885 to 1896. Religion He joined the Congregational Church before he left Scotland, and was active in the Adelaide church as Sunday-school teacher, lay preacher, and deacon.

Under the Patent Act,Patent Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. P-4. only certain categories of things may be considered and defined as inventions. Therefore, if a patent discloses an item that fulfills the requirements of novelty, non-obviousness and utility, it may nonetheless be found invalid on the grounds that it does not fall within one of the statutory categories of “invention”. Since the Patent Act, the categories of patentable subject matter have been defined and interpreted by Canadian courts. Definition and categories of invention Section 2 of the Patent Act defines “invention” as: > [A]ny new and useful art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of > matter, or any new and useful improvement in any art, process, machine, > manufacture or composition of matter.Patent Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. P-4 at s. > 2. Each of the five categories of inventions has been further defined by the Canadian Intellectual Property Office and the Canadian courts. Art Shell Oil Co. v. Commissioner of Patents defined the term “art” broadly as the application of knowledge to effect a desired result. A narrower interpretation of the term was offered by Lawson v. Canada (Commissioner of Patents): > An art or operation is an act or series of acts performed by some physical > agent upon some physical object and producing in such object some change > either of character or of condition.Lawson v. Canada (Commissioner of > Patents) (1970), 62 C.P.R. 101 (Ex. Ct.) at p. 109. Process A process is the application of a method to a material or materials.Commissioner of Patents v. Ciba Ltd., [1959] S.C.R. 378 at 383. The process may be patentable even if the process does not produce a patentable product.Canadian Intellectual Property Office, Manual of Patent Office Practice (1998 ed., updated to December 2010), c. 12.02.02. In Tennessee Eastman Co. v. Commissioner of Patents, the Supreme Court of Canada concluded that medical or therapeutic methods are not contemplated in the definition of invention as a kind of process.Crowne , Emir Aly, Methods of Medical Treatment Still Unpatentable in Canada (February 1, 2011). Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice, February 2011 Machine The Canadian Intellectual Property Office's Manual of Patent Office Practice has defined a machine as the mechanical embodiment of any function or mode of operation designed to accomplish a particular effect.Canadian Intellectual Property Office, Manual of Patent Office Practice (1998 ed., updated to December 2010), c. 12.02.03. Manufacture Manufacture implies a product made by hand, by machine, industrially, by mass production and so forth, by changing the character or condition of material objects.Canadian Intellectual Property Office, Manual of Patent Office Practice (1998 ed., updated to December 2010), c. 12.02.04. Harvard College v. Canada (Commissioner of Patents), as discussed below, has held that higher life forms, such as genetically altered mice, do not fall within the meaning of manufacture.Harvard College v. Canada (Commissioner of Patents), [2002] 4 S.C.R. 45. Composition of matter “Composition of matter” is defined as a combination of ingredients or substances – a solid, gas, or fluid – as a chemical union or a physical mixture.David Vaver, Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-Marks, 2nd ed (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2011) at 294. This definition has been taken to include enzymes, reproducible modified genes, and the cells that carry them.Continental Soya Co. Ltd. v. j.R. Short Milling Co. (Canada) Ltd., [1942] S.C.R. 187. However, Harvard College v. Canada (Commissioner of Patents) has drawn a distinction between lower and higher life forms (see below).Harvard College v. Canada (Commissioner of Patents), [2002] 4 S.C.R. 45. Where an invention is a combination of elements, the elements must produce something that is more than a mere sum of their individual effects. In other words, if each element functions independently and there is no common result, there is no inventive composition.Hunter v. Carrick, [1885] 11 S.C.R. 300 at 302. Improvements Most inventions are not pioneering inventions in a new field or industry, but are rather improvements to existing arts, processes, machines, manufacturers and compositions of matter.David Vaver, Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-Marks, 2nd ed (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2011) at 290. It has been held that a newfound medical use for a known and patented pharmaceutical compound may qualify as an improvement in an art.Apotex Ltd. v. Wellcome Foundation Ltd. (2000), 10 C.P.R. (4th) 64 (F.C.A.) at para. 86-87, 90. The elimination of an element from a previously patented composition which results in a new and useful improvement may also be patentable.Electrolier Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. Dominion Manufacturers Ltd., [1934] S.C.R. 436 at p. 441 Excluded and contentious subject matter Scientific principles and abstract theorems Section 27(8) of the Patent Act provides: > No patent shall be granted for any mere scientific principle or abstract > theorem.Patent Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. P-4 at s. 27(8). This is the only section within the Patent Act that explicitly excludes certain subject matter from patents. Practical applications of scientific principles and abstract theorems, however, are not excluded from patentability. Therefore, while Newton's law of universal gravitation may not be patentable, a patent may be granted for the practical application of the theory, such as an improved gravity pump.David Vaver, Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-Marks, 2nd ed (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2011) at 308. Higher life forms: Harvard and Schmeiser In Harvard College v. Canada (Commissioner of Patents), Harvard researchers appealed the Commissioner of Patent's rejection of their patent application for genetically altered mice that possess an oncogene, termed oncomice, as well as the process by which the oncomice were created. The Supreme Court of Canada, by a narrow 5 to 4 majority, found that the Patent Act, specifically the categories of “manufacture” and “composition of matter” did not cover higher life forms: > Owing to the fact that the patenting of higher life forms is a highly > contentious and complex matter that raises serious practical, ethical and > environmental concerns that the Act does not contemplate, I conclude that > the Commissioner was correct to reject the patent application. This is a > policy issue that raises questions of great significance and importance and > that would appear to require a dramatic expansion of the traditional patent > regime. Absent explicit legislative direction, the Court should not order > the Commissioner to grant a patent on a higher life form.Harvard College v. > Canada (Commissioner of Patents), [2002] 4 S.C.R. 45 at para. 155. Two years later, in Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser, an equally narrow majority of the Supreme Court found that a farmer, by knowingly growing a crop containing genetically modified genes and cells that was not purchased, had infringed Monsanto's patent.Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 902. Schmeiser, the farmer, argued that, per Harvard College v. Canada (Commissioner of Patents), higher life forms, such as plants, do not constitute patentable subject matter in Canada, even though Monsanto's patent was only directed to the modified gene and the cells containing the gene. This argument was rejected by a majority of the Court, which found that “[w]hether or not patent protection for the gene and the cell extends to activities involving the plant is not relevant to the patent’s validity”,Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 902 at para. 24. and since Monsanto did not claim a patent for a genetically modified plant per se, its claim of the gene and the cell was considered patentable subject matter. The distinction drawn in Harvard between higher and lower life forms has been criticized as one that is difficult to draw and has no logical basis.David Vaver, Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-Marks, 2nd ed (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2011) at 299.Crowne , Emir Aly, Can You Patent That? A Review of Subject Matter Eligibility in Canada and the United States (August 1, 2009). Temple International & Comparative Law Journal, Vol. 23, No. 2, 2009 However, after Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser, this distinction may not even matter anymore because even though, per Harvard College v. Canada (Commissioner of Patents), higher life forms such as plants or animals are not patentable, Monsanto Canada Inc. v.

This invention allowed customers shopping online to make purchases with one-click buying, which circumvents the process of entering address and billing information in the traditional shopping cart mode of online shopping. The Commissioner of Patents rejected the patent finding that the substance of the claims were directed to a \\"business method\\". The Commissioner argued \\"business methods\\" were excluded as patentable subject matter. Amazon.com appealed the matter to the Federal Court. The Federal Court rejected the Commissioner's characterization of \\"business methods\\" as an excluded category of subject matter.

He became a student in the yeshiva after his bar mitzvah, and continued to study and teach there for almost 70 years. Early life and education Tzadka was born in Jerusalem to Shaul Tzadka, a Jewish merchant from Baghdad who had immigrated to Ottoman Palestine around 1900 with his wife, Simcha, a niece of the Ben Ish Chai. The family lived in the Beit Yisrael neighborhood, and young Yehuda attended Talmud Torah Bnei Tzion in the Bukharim Quarter. After his bar mitzvah he enrolled in Porat Yosef Yeshiva in Jerusalem's Old City, which had opened a year earlier. Following the death of rosh yeshiva Shlomo Laniado, Tzadka became a student of the new rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Ezra Attiya, from whom he continued to learn for the next 45 years.Mizrahi, Moshe. \\"Protecting the Trust: Harav Yehuda Tzadka, zt\\"l - His vision, his sacrifices and the legacy he left for us, twenty years after his petirah\\". Hamodia Magazine, 21 October 2010, pp. 12-14. Tzadka was a diligent student who rose to the top of his class. He studied by day in the yeshiva and at night in the Be'er Sheva synagogue in Beis Yisrael. Every Friday night he would study in the Shoshanim L'David Synagogue, where Sephardi talmidei chachamim (Torah sages) congregated. Talmudic lecturer Geula branch of Porat Yosef Yeshiva In 1937 Attiya suggested Tzadka as a replacement for a senior Talmudic lecturer who was unable to continue teaching. Tzadka's first class included Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Rabbi Ben Zion Abba Shaul, Rabbi Yehuda Moallem, Rabbi Baruch Ben Haim, and Rabbi Ezra Ades, all of whom would go on to leadership positions in the Sephardi Torah world. Tzadka taught in classic Sephardi style, focusing on the Talmudic commentaries of the Maharsha and the Maharam. Like Attiya, he also emphasized the study of musar (ethics) texts such as Mesillat Yesharim. He distinguished himself as a teacher by his ability to gear each lesson to the level of his students. Tzadka was characterized by his love of Torah and its sages, and his desire and alacrity to perform mitzvot. He lived simply and encouraged his students to be content without luxuries. Although he was qualified to serve as a dayan (religious judge), and was asked to join a new regional beth din founded by Rabbi Reuven Katz, Rav of Petah Tikva, Tzadka preferred to keep learning and teaching in Porat Yosef. During the 1948 Arab- Israeli War, when the Jordanian army captured the Old City, Tzadka supervised groups of Porat Yosef students learning in synagogues in the neighborhoods of Geula, Katamon, and the Bukharim Quarter. After the war, he traveled to England for four months to raise money on behalf of a new yeshiva building, which was erected in the Geula neighborhood in the mid-1950s. Beyond the walls of the yeshiva, Tzadka was active throughout Israel, encouraging Sephardi families to give their children a Torah education rather than send them to secular schools. He spoke at rallies sponsored by the P'eylim organization on behalf of Torah education for new immigrants, and made the rounds on school registration days, begging parents to register their children in Torah schools. After the founding of the State of Israel, he visited absorption camps in which hundreds of thousands of Sephardi Jews who had left or been expelled from Arab countries were living, urging parents not to send their children to secular schools and encouraging established communities to open Torah schools for immigrant children. When Attiya died in May 1970, the yeshiva directors asked Tzadka to become the new rosh yeshiva. He agreed, but when he saw a new sign on the door of his classroom: \\"Rabbi Yehuda Tzadka, Rosh Yeshiva\\", he insisted that it be taken down and refused to be called by that title. Later years In 1984 he published the sefer Kol Yehuda (The Voice of Yehuda), a book of halakha and aggadah incorporating his approach to all matters of life. In his later years he suffered a series of heart attacks, but was able to recover and return to his teaching. Even while hospitalized, he continued his practice of rising at midnight for Tikkun Chatzot and praying vasikin (the sunrise service). During one hospitalization, he was visited by Rabbi Elazar Shach, who found him lying in a bed in the intensive-care unit with a sefer, engrossed in Torah study. He suffered his last heart attack during the night of the Fast of Gedaliah in 1991 and was taken to hospital. Two weeks later he suffered a stroke and lapsed into a coma. He died on 20 October 1991 (12 Cheshvan 5752) and was buried in the Sanhedria Cemetery in a family plot. He was succeeded as rosh yeshiva by Rabbi Ben Zion Abba Shaul. After the latter's death in 1998, Tzadka's son, Rabbi Moshe Tzadka, was named rosh yeshiva of the Geula branch of Porat Yosef Yeshiva. Family Tzadka married Fahima Batat, daughter of Rabbi Selim Tzalach Batat of Baghdad, in 1934. They had five sons and two daughters. Fahima died at the age of 57, after which Tzadka remarried, to Tamar Asuderi, who survived him.

Born in Irbid in the Ottoman Empire on 25 May 1899, Tal completed his elementary education in his hometown, later leaving to complete his high school education in Damascus. His rebellious and stubborn temperament would appear as early as his high school years in Damascus, when he would be exiled several times by the Ottoman authorities for participating in school strikes against their policies in the region. In his adulthood, Tal would be imprisoned and exiled several times for democratic activism or for insulting high-ranking officials by the governments of the Arab Kingdom of Syria, and, after its downfall, by the government of the Emirate of Transjordan. His first job was in Karak, Transjordan, as an Arabic literature teacher. Later Tal would be appointed as Administrative Governor of Wadi Al-Seer and Shoubak in the 1920s. After earning a law degree in 1930, he would hold several positions in the judiciary before being appointed as Chief of Protocol at the Emir's Court. Tal then was laid off from his job and imprisoned for 70 days after an altercation with a Prime Minister serving during that time. This would be the latest in a series of exiles and imprisonments he faced throughout his life. Tal became desperate and his alcoholism worsened, contributing to his death on 24 May 1949. Tal's relationship with the nomadic Dom (gypsy) community in Transjordan, which are called Nawar in Arabic, influenced much of his poetry, whereas he named his only poetry collection, Ashiyyat Wadi Al-Yabis, in reference to the festive nights he spent with the Nawar and to a Nawari woman he loved. Tal found justice, equality and lack of classism among the Nawari community, which he thought was lacking in Transjordan's cities. He reflected these views in many of his poems, as well as venerating the lands of Jordan, and at other times vehemently criticizing its government's policies. He also wrote poems dedicated to criticizing British policies which supported Zionism in Palestine along with British colonial officers in Transjordan, while other poems he wrote venerated alcohol and were about women. Tal is Jordan's most celebrated poet. The country's most illustrious literary award is named after him, and his hometown of Irbid holds an annual literary festival in his name. The house where he used to live in Irbid was turned into a museum that welcomes hundreds of visitors annually. He was married four times, two of which ended in divorce. He had ten children. His eldest son Wasfi Tal was Jordan's Prime Minister for several tenures during the late 1960s and early 1970s until his assassination in 1971. Biography Early life Mustafa Wahbi Tal was born in Irbid, Syria Vilayet, Ottoman Empire on 25 May 1899 to an illiterate father and a mother that was \\"blasphemously stubborn\\" according to his friend and biographer Ya'qoub Al-Oudat. He was named Mustafa as namesake of his grandfather and Wahbi was added to his birth name per Ottoman tradition. From a young age, Tal suffered from Rhotacism, a speech impediment characterized in the inability to pronounce 'r' sounds. His family were Sunni Muslims, descended from the Bani Zaydan tribe which migrated from Najd in Arabia to the Levant around the 18th century; his family was called Tal because a member of the tribe, Yousef Abbas, had settled in Amman, next the city's Citadel, which was built on a hill or 'tal' in Arabic. Three decades later they relocated to Irbid and remained there. The patio of Tal's family house in Irbid which was turned into a museum in 1989 after his grave was relocated there. The museum receives hundreds of visitors annually. Tal finished his elementary school education in Irbid in 1911. In 1912, Tal headed to the Anbur School in Damascus. After two or three years of studying there, he participated with his fellow classmates in a strike protesting against the Ottomans' policies in the region. During the strike, the Ottoman governor of Damascus Ismail Fazıl Pasha, the Turkish Education Principal, and State Inspector General Sheikh Abdul Jalil Al-Durrah visited the school. After the Sheikh finished his speech, Tal made his way between the students, stood in the middle of the campus and shouted while pointing at the Sheikh: \\"This man is a charlatan liar!\\" According to Al-Oudat, it was this incident and the ones that followed them that made Tal known to the Ottoman authorities of being a student fond of \\"messing around and creating chaos during lessons, so much that the Turkish teachers called him a field mouse.\\" Adulthood Tal returned for a summer vacation in his hometown of Irbid in 1916. The stubbornness he inherited from his mother was beginning to impact his relationship with his father who refused to let him return to continue his studies in Damascus. Instead his father kept him in Irbid to work in the private school which he founded, the Ottoman Salihhya School. On 20 June 1917, Tal and his friend Mohammad Subhi Abu Ghnaimeh headed to the capital of the Empire, Istanbul, for a visit. On the way, they passed by an area in Turkey named Arapgir where Tal's uncle and his friend's brother lived. Instead of heading to Istanbul, he stayed there and in 1918 he began working for the Eskişehir magazine. He became bored after five months of working at the magazine and resigned in March 1919. He returned to Irbid in April. He spent the summer there and convinced his father to send him back to the Anbur School in Damascus to complete his high school education. In 1919, he published a joke in the Damascene Brotherhood Magazine owned by Jubran Masuh: Both Tal and Masuh were arrested for this joke. Masuh later understood that Tal's joke was mocking Ali Rikabi, the Military Governor of Arab Kingdom of Syria, which was established in the Levant following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire toward the end of World War I. In another episode of Tal's rebellious and stubborn temperament, he and the students at Anbur demanded the school principal provide them with military training to fight the French authorities in Syria. The principal told them that those who wanted the military should go volunteer and those who wanted science should stay in the school. Tal told him that he wanted to make the school a military training camp to which his principal replied: \\"You want it a military training camp with a cigarette in your mouth?\\" Tal then threw the cigarette so forcefully that it burnt the tip of the principal's pants. Tal during the 1920s, colorized. Before graduating, Tal participated in another strike that ended up with his expulsion to Aleppo with his friend Abu Ghnaimeh. During Tal's time in Aleppo he mastered Turkish and learnt some Persian. Al-Oudat stated that it was during his stay in Aleppo that Tal read the Rubaiyat of Persian poet Omar Khayyam and translated Apre La Bataille from French. Tal gained his high school degree from the Aleppo Preparation School. The Arab Syrian Kingdom was toppled by the French in 1920 and an Emirate over Transjordan was then established in early 1921 by the Hashemite Emir Abdullah of the Hejaz as a British protectorate. Tal returned to Transjordan and worked as an Arabic literature teacher in the city of Karak where he met Al-Oudat for the first time. Al-Oudat wrote in Tal's biography: Political activism in Transjordan and Palestine In the 1920s, Tal became politically active in Transjordan and Palestine. He began writing articles in the Jaffa-based Al-Karmil newspaper owned by Palestinian Christian journalist Nagib Nassar. He wrote political essays, literature, translated stories and news about Transjordan. In 1922, Tal and Nassar began advocating Arab nationalism as they visited Nazareth in 1922, warning there of the dangers of exploiting religion. They also visited Karak to promote pan-Arab unity. He wrote a poem warning about the 1917 Balfour Declaration by the British government promising the Jews a homeland in Palestine Participation in Adwan Rebellion In May 1923, Tal was appointed as Administrative Governor of the Wadi Al-Seer area west of Transjordan's capital Amman. He remained in his job until being fired on 8 July 1923, the day in which he was arrested with Auda Qoussous, Shamsudeen Sami, Saleh Najdawi, Ali Sharkasi and other Transjordanian intellectuals who sided with the Adwan tribe during the Adwan Rebellion. The rebellion was started by Sultan Adwan, chief of the tribes of the Balqa (central Transjordan), who was enraged with Emir Abdullah's close alliance with the Bani Sakher tribe, the Adwan tribes' rivals. Adwan was equally angry with the staffing of the Emir's government with Syrians, Lebanese and Palestinians which gained him the sympathy of Transjordanian intellectuals. This led Tal to coin the slogan \\"Jordan for Jordanians,\\" and calls for democratization in the country. Those arrested were charged with \\"organizing a secret organization intending to overthrow the regime.\\" Tal was first exiled to Ma'an for 9 months, then Aqaba, and then Jeddah which was then part of the Hashemite Kingdom of Hejaz. After his release, he was appointed as Administrative Governor of Shoubak. Tal later wrote about his exile: Following riots in Wadi Musa village near Shoubak, he was removed from his position. He refused to interrogate the rioters and was accused by the British Representative in Transjordan of being unable to restore order. Two years later he was acquitted from these charges. Tal was appointed as a teacher in 1926 for two months. He was arrested again on the charges of displaying the Bolshevik emblem, becoming inebriated in a public bar, and publicly reciting a poem that insulted the Emir, the Prime Minister, and the law. Relationship with the Dom/Nawar community in Transjordan Tal in late 1920s. Before leaving Shoubak, he began his long-lasting relationship with the nomadic Dom (gypsy) community in Transjordan, which are called Nawar in Arabic. This friendship deepened as spent his nights at their quarters between the areas of Madaba and Ajloun's Wadi Al-Yabis valley with the Nawar's donkeys, Rebabs, dancers and singers. He was so deeply affected by the time he spent with them that he named his only diwan (poetry collection), Ashiyyat Wadi Al-Yabis, which he gifted to a Nawari woman. Tal viewed the Kharabeesh, the tent-like structures where the Nawar people lived, to be places of safety and security where he found the justice and equality that he believed was lacking in Transjordan's cities. He found the Nawar to be marginalized, simple and generous, with no classism. He reflected these views in many of his poems, such as in the following verses: In another instance, he wrote a long poem titled Al-Oubodyeh Al-Kobra (The Great Slavery) chastising the Irbid Attorney General after he expelled the Nawari community leader Mohammad Al-Fahel (nicknamed Al-Haber) from the courthouse because of his torn and dirty clothes: Opposition to the first Anglo-Transjordanian treaty Tal making a speech that discussed Transjordan's political and economic status and warned attendees of British policies in support of Zionism in Palestine which, according to him, aimed to turn it into a Jewish homeland that neglected the rights of the Arab natives during the Third National Conference on 25 May 1930. In 1927, he was appointed principal of Al Husn School for seven months before resigning due to his active opposition to the Anglo-Transjordanian treaty of 1928, which gave Britain sweeping powers over the Transjordanian state. The government of Transjordan accused Tal of inciting opposition to the treaty among the inhabitants of Ajloun. The Governor of Ajloun then sentenced him to house arrest in Amman for a few months. After he was released, Tal made a speech at the Third National Conference highlighting the Transjordan's political and economic status and warned attendees of British policies in support of Zionism in Palestine which, according to him, aimed to turn it into a Jewish homeland that neglected the rights of the Arab natives. The conference concluded with demanding an elected legislature that holds the Emir's government accountable. As civil servant In 1928, Tal was preparing to publish his own newspaper under the name of Al-Anba' (The News). He wrote most of its articles before he was banned from publishing them. Later he was appointed as Administrative Governor of Shoubak for the second time. In 1931, Tal was exiled to Aqaba for four months because of an article he published in Al-Karmil. He befriended an Afghan sheikh there, where Tal would often drink alcohol and the sheikh tea together. Tal was released after he wrote a poem apologizing to Prime Minister Abd Allah Siraj. In 1931, Tal worked as a teacher in his hometown of Irbid. During this time, Tal enjoyed a good relationship with Emir Abdullah despite their previous altercations. He accompanied him on several visits to the Badia (desert). Tal turned from working in the Ministry of Education to the judiciary after having succeeded in a legal examination at the end of 1929. He worked as the Chief Clerk of the Irbid Court of First Instance, then the Commander of the Amman Procedure Court, Chief Clerk of the Court of Appeal (1935) and finally as the Public Prosecutor of Al-Salt and its Deputy Attorney General. During the latter position, he filed a case against Transjordan's Prime Minister Ibrahim Hashem who had exiled him to Jeddah in 1923. The Court found that there was no reason to expel Tal from his job and that the charge pressed did not amount worthy of exile. Tal then became Inspector General in the Ministry of Education and then Chief of Protocol at the Emir's Court. He remained as Chief of Protocol for five months before being laid off in 1942 and jailed at the Mahatta Prison for 70 days because of an altercation with then Prime Minister Tawfik Abu Al-Huda. Death After his release from prison he worked as a lawyer. His alcoholism worsened and he began feeling overwhelmingly bitter and desperate. \\"Disease, desperation and alcohol were all destroying him and shortening his life\\", according to Al-Oudat. On 25 May 1949, a day before his 50th birthday, Al-Oudate wrote that \\"in the Amman Public Hospital, the hand of death was hard on Arar and it stabbed his beating heart. Before he grasped his last breath, he said in an innocent Irbidi accent 'ugh if I can get better and say what is in my heart... Ugh ugh if I can say an ugh that is satisfactory.'\\" Works 'Ashiyyat Wadi Al-Yabis Tal died in 1949 without publishing any collections of his poems, which he used to sign using the pseudonym Arar, a reference to the son of Amro bin Sha, a figure in Arab and Islamic history. Tal gathered his poems in 1933 and named his Diwan, poem collection, Ashiyyat Wadi Al-Yabis (The Nights of Al-Yabis Valley). The title of his poem collection was reminiscent of the times he spent with the Dom community. But Tal's friends disagree with this interpretation and insist that Ashiyyat was the name of a gypsy woman he loved rather than referring to \\"nights\\". Tal's friend Mahmoud Motlaq published Ashiyyat Wadi Al-Yabis in 1954, which included 66 poems that Tal's son Maryoud collected from newspapers and drafts. Moutlaq excluded 20 verses from publishing because he considered them to be \\"bad\\". When Tal's other friend Yacoub Al-Oudat published his biography titled Arar: Jordan's poet in 1958, it included more than 500 verses which were not present in Moutlaq's first edition of Ashiyyat Wadi Al-Yabis. But Al-Oudat admitted that he left out a couple of verses that included profanity because he said that poets shouldn't be remembered for a couple of inappropriate verses that they wrote in a fist of fury. In 1973, professor Mahmoud Al-Samra published the second edition of Ashiyyat Wadi Al-Yabis in which he included 33 verses that weren't published in the first edition. In 1982, academic Ziad Zou'bi found tens of verses in both editions of Ashiyyat Wadi Al-Yabis and Arar: Jordan's poet that were not written by Tal but by other poets. In his edition, he removed them from the main part, attributed them to the original writer and added them in an annex. Zou'bi published three more editions in 1988, 2007 and 2017. Many of Tal's poem venerate Jordan. He was the first Jordanian poet to include geographical references in his poetry. In this poem, he was talking with a preacher named Sheikh Aboud: Talal in mid 1930s. Tal also wrote poems criticizing the British colonial officials in Jordan including Frederick Peake and Glubb Pasha, Transjordan's Arab Legion commanders, and Lieutenant Colonel Henry Cox, the British Representative. In addition to Tal, Emir Abdullah was also a poet and the two men were one of the leading poets of their day, responsible for formulating alternate visions of the country through their poetry. Many of Tal's poems were about women and alcohol: Talal Tal wrote a manuscript titled Talal and gifted it to Emir Abdullah's son, Crown Prince Talal. Tal was also Talal's secretary for a short period during the mid-1930s and the two are thought to have enjoyed a close relationship. Translation of Rubayat of Omar Khayyam He returned to Khayyam's writings in 1926 but then as a critic and translator. Tal disagreed with Lebanese writer Amine Nakhlé's translations of the Khayyam, using his knowledge of Persian and Sufism. Nakhleh discontinued translating it and Tal replaced him publishing it in Beirut-based Minerva magazine. Political papers and letters Mohammad Ka'oush published Awraq Arar al-Syasya: Wathaeq Mustafa Wahbi Tal (Arar's Political Papers: Documents of Mustafa Wahbi Tal) in 1980, a collection of 33 articles written by Tal in Al-Karmil, which he used to sign his with the pseudonym \\"Monaser\\" and at other times \\"Ibn Jala\\".Mustafa Wahbi Tal with his children, early 1930s. Tal wrote essays about the political scene in Transjordan and Palestine. He corresponded with several influential figures including: Sharif Hussein bin Ali, Emir Abdullah, Jordanian activist Suleiman Nabulsi, Palestinian leader Haj Amin Al-Husseini, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa El-Nahas, American British historian Bernard Lewis and to several newspaper editors in Egypt, Syria and Palestine. Tal's other writings were published in three book by Zeyad Zou'bi: Ala Hamesh Ashiyyat (On the sidelines of Ashiyyat, 2001), Maqalat Wa Nosous Thaqafieh (Articles and Cultural Writings, 2002), and Arar Wa Khayyam (Arar and Khayyam, 2003). Legacy Mustafa Wahbi Tal is considered to be one of Jordan's most prominent poets and one of the most well-known Jordanian poets among Arab readers. The Yarmouk University in his hometown of Irbid named Jordan's most prestigious literary award after him, the Arar Prize for Literary Creativity. Irbid holds an annual poetry festival named after him. The Arar Literary Forum holds cultural events in Tal's house in Irbid, which was turned into a museum that welcomes hundreds of visitors annually. Personal life Mustafa Wahbi Tal and his son Wasfi during late 1930s. Wasfi Tal would later become Jordan's Prime Minister for several tenures during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Tal was married four times and had ten children. His first marriage was to Munifa Baban, a Kurdish woman he met during his time in Arapgir, Turkey. They were married on 25 November 1918. When Tal left his job in Arapgir and returned to his hometown of Irbid, he left his wife at his uncle's house. His first son Wasfi was born there. Wasfi later relocated with his mother to live at his father's house in Irbid when he was four years old. The couple would later have five more children: Mou'een, Maryoud, Sa'eed, Shaker and Abdallah. Tal also married Shoma Harb Dhyat in 1925. The day after their marriage he left to a faraway village to arbitrate a tribal dispute and sent her divorce papers from there. He was married again to Oufa' Al-Jabr, a Bedouin woman, in 1933 and the couple had four children: Safieh, Sayel, Alieh and Taha. He married Adwieh 'Araj, a Circassian woman, in 1943 and was divorced shortly after. When Tal was jailed and expelled from his job as Chief of Protocol in the Emir's Court in 1942 because of an altercation with then Prime Minister Tawfik Abu Al-Huda, his eldest son Wasfi was outraged and sought an interview with the Prime Minister who refused to see him. Wasfi lost his temper in the corridor outside the Prime Minister's office and launched into a tirade of abuse and curses which were overheard by Abu Al-Huda. He was jailed with his father for three months and lost his job as a chemistry teacher. Wasfi later became Jordan's Prime Minister for several tenures during the late 1960s and early 1970s until his assassination in 1971. Mustafa's other son Sa'eed would later become Deputy Prime Minister of Jordan during the 1990s.

Black Market Birth Control: Contraceptive Entrepreneurship and Criminality in the Gilded Age  Biography  Sarah Ann Blakeslee was the daughter of a Presbyterian clergyman (James Blakeslee),1850 Federal census; Nanticoke, Broome, New York who spent some time working as a missionary among people of color and Jamaican roots. She was raised in Broome County, New York and discovered at the age of twelve a passion to become a religious speaker. The purpose for her career choice had been derived from the hopes of gaining classical and medical knowledge in order to pursue a job within the medical field. Sarah wanted to aid those who suffered mentally and physically. She was characterized as a woman of courage and strength which was something that she displayed early on, by starting from bottom and guiding herself up to the top, by earning a doctor degree. Sarah had faced numerous conflicts within her life, as well as career that ultimately resulted from her gender and social class within the time period. She was a woman that wanted other woman to have a choice in their life, starting with their own body. She left the decision to prevent pregnancy up to other woman which caused this conflicting argument of whether or not her theory behind birth control was valid and if it disobeyed the churches' opinion.CHASE, MRS. SARAH BLAKELEE - Biographies - History of Homeopathy - Presented by Sylvain Cazalet  Early life  Sarah Blakeslee was raised by her father, James Blakeslee, and mother, Rachel. She had five brothers.1850 Federal Census Nanticoke, Broome, New York. She grew up in what many would describe as poverty, and her father had very little means to pay for her education. Women who wanted to seek employment often struggled due to men being prejudiced which decreased their chances. Luckily for Sarah she began working at the age of sixteen as a teacher’s assistant while still attending school. She graduated from Alfred University, in Allegheny County, New York at the age of twenty one, and decided to put herself through medical school.http://sueyounghistories.com.archives/2008/02/01/sarah-blakesley-chase- and-homeopathy/  Married life  Sarah Ann Blakeslee married Hazard D. Chase in Cleveland in 1875,The Evening World (New York) 31 May 1893 \\"Sara B. Chase On The Stand\\" and was divorced from him in December 1878.The New York Times 31 Dec 1878, pg2 Hazard was an alumnus of Michigan University. He decided to enlist in the Army, and returned to his wife four years later. Sarah Chase had a one daughter from this marriage, Grace L. On December 4, 1888 Sarah married Thomas Hookey of Denver, Colorado. \\"At exactly 9:15pm Mrs. Chase entered the parlor from the vestibule door on the arm of Judge Hookey, and the couple took their stand between the palms. There were no introductory remarks, but the judge immediately took Mrs. Chase's right hand and with a voice broken with emotion said: I take thee, Sarah B. Chase, as my lawful, wedded wife, proving to you in the presences of these witnesses to be a loving husband in sickness and in health until death do us part.\\" Mrs. Chase then said her vow. Then they signed a marriage contract and their guests signed it as witnesses.The Philadelphia Inquirer 5 Dec 1888 \\"Queer Wedding and Courtship\\"5\\\\. They Married Themselves. New York Times (8157-1922) [New York, N.Y] 05 Dec 1888:8. This marriage lasted eight months. At her manslaughter trial in 1893, Sara stated that she did not know what had become of Mr. Hookey.  Mid life  In 1868 Chase decided to go an alternate route. She then attended Cleveland Hospital College. Her new ambitions had been to maintain a career in teaching, but with a focus in physiology and sexology in order to teach it at local churches to men and women. Some believe that it was her new focus that led her to begin selling and exporting birth control. Chase first begun distributing contraceptives in 1873 and did so for four years until her first arrest. In May 1878, Chase was arrested by Anthony Comstock, chief agent in the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, for violating a federal law which banned the dissemination and distribution of contraceptives through the mail or across state lines. Chase had been set up by individuals that worked with Comstock and had been arrested on the sight of the crime. Some believe that Comstock had previous knowledge of Chase’s black market birth control but lacked the evidence he needed in order to convict her. Chase was released on a fifteen hundred dollar bail and when finally brought to trial a jury that consisted of solely men dismissed the case due to insufficient amount of evidence. After discovering that there would be no trial, Comstock had become outraged and demanded that something be done. He designed two bills of indictment that could be used against Chase but required a signature but neither the prosecutors nor judge wanted to take part. After discovering that Chase had been falsely arrested she filed a ten thousand dollar civil lawsuit against Comstock but got nowhere with it. As far as arrest, documents indicate that between the years of 1878 and 1900 Chase had been arrested five times but did not affect her practice or mentality regarding the prevention of conception. One of the justifications for her arrest had been on the basis of a death (of Maggie Manzon on Feb 12, 1893) that was caused by an abortion, not from the actual birth control, which resulted in Chase serving jail time (convicted of manslaughter in the first degree (June 1893) and sentenced to 9 years and 8 months in state prison). On June 4, 1990 she was arrested again by Comstock for the distributing of articles that provided details on the prevention of pregnancy. When brought before a jury, the charges were once again dropped. Birth control to some was looked upon as a crime, while others had a different mindset about maintaining a sense of control regarding the number of babies that entered the world. Though we only know very little about Sarah B. Chase, she was one of the first woman leaders in the black market for birth control, and her success enabled others to take a stand. For instance, Margaret Sanger fought against legal impediments to reproductive rights in the 1920s. By having a change in society, Comstock decided to take the next step in seeking to have certain laws passed. One particular law, that banned distributing any type of document that promoted the prevention of conception, was a law that Comstock had lacked in previous years as a basis for arrest in regards to Sarah Chase.Black Market Birth Control: Contraceptive Entrepreneurship and Criminality in the Gilded Age  Divorce  Historians believe that because of Sarah’s will power to succeed, her marriage had suffered drastically. On December 15, 1878 her husband, Dr Hazard D Chase, decided to sue his wife, Sarah Chase, for divorce in argument of abandonment. The case was taken to court where Mr. Chase provided that indicated that his wife’s career had taken a toll on their marriage. The defense argued that because of Mrs. Chase’s determination and aspiration it led her to become a successful physician. As a result of her accomplishment, it caused tension between her and Mr. Chase due to his constant comparison to the ideal wife to Sarah. It has created a disconnect, especially on her part which eventually led to her deciding that the best option was for her and her daughter, Grace L. Chase, to be removed from the situation. Throughout the trial, both parties spoke about the marriage and their feelings for one another but the trial went nowhere and the divorce was finalized Dec. 30, 1878.The New York Times 31 Dec 1878, pg 2Dr. Sara B. Chase sued for Divorce. New York (1857-1922) [New York, N.Y] Dec 16 1878: 1. It is unclear if she divorced her second husband, Thomas Hookey, or simply ended what had been an unconventional union. After eight months of marriage she ordered Mr. Hookey to leave and gave him a payment of $5,000 cash. Mr. Hookey pressed for alimony, which Dr. Chase refused. Dr, Chase stated that Mr. Hookey had lied about being wealthy and was in fact after her wealth.The New York Herald, August 8, 1889 However, years later she would pass herself off as Sarah T Hookey, the widow of Thomas1910 Federal census; District 0065, Kansas City Ward 5, Jackson, Missouri while living with her daughter and son in law.

In 2016 Talley's diversified into coal mining in a joint purchase with Bathurst Resources of former Solid Energy mines at Stockton, Rotowaro and Maramarua. History The rusting hull of the Janie Seddon The company's first fishing vessel was the Janie Seddon. Built in the United Kingdom in 1903, the Janie Seddon was one of two submarine minelaying vessels brought out from England to New Zealand that same year. The Janie Seddon was based in Wellington, with its twin, the Lady Roberts, based in Auckland. The Janie Seddon was used in port during World Wars I and II, and was also the examination vessel during World War II. In 1936 the Janie Seddon was purchased by Talley's Fisheries, and was their first vessel. She is now a rusting hulk on the Motueka foreshore, near the headquarters of Talley's.

It is a category B listed building. History Early history Kirkintilloch Town Hall in the early 1900s The current building was commissioned to replace the old tolbooth in West High Street which had been completed in 1815. After rapid industrial expansion and population growth in the local area, as well as a deterioration in the condition of the tolbooth, civic leaders decided to procure a purpose- built town hall: the site they selected in Union Street had previously been occupied by a school. The new building was designed by Walker and Ramsay of Glasgow in the classical style. Paid for by public subscription, it cost £11,000 to build and opened in July 1906. The design involved a symmetrical frontage with five bays along Union Street; the central section of three bays featured an unusual bowed triple-doorway on the ground floor with a frieze and cornice above; there were six tall narrow windows on the first floor. The building was renovated in 1931 and extended in 1959. Closure and redevelopment The building was closed by East Dunbartonshire Council on 30 June 2004, largely due to the anticipated expense of restoring a building constructed of notoriously crumbling soft sandstone. In response, the Kirkintilloch Town Hall Preservation Trust was established as a registered charity to preserve the Hall and restore it for community use. In November 2010 rats were sighted inside the building and concerns were expressed that the hall could be infested with them. After the local newspaper asked East Dunbartonshire Council to see inside the building, the council turned down the request on the grounds of health and safety. Campsie and Kirkintilloch North councillor Charles Kennedy said that this showed how much the premises had deteriorated and called for their demolition. In December 2011 the Kirkintilloch Herald's request for access was granted and the paper reported on the building's condition; parts of the ceiling on one side of the hall had fallen onto the floor and there was debris lying all around, considerable dampness and crumbling paintwork. East Dunbartonshire Council stated that extensive dry rot and general fabric deterioration were the main problems with the Hall. In the early summer of 2016 work began on the redevelopment of the hall into a centre for heritage, arts and culture. In July 2016, and in the course of works being done as part of the redevelopment, a number of Roman items were discovered in the building's car park, including pottery and a nail. The hall was officially reopened in November 2018.

He was also one of the most powerful men of the entire Spanish Caribbean. He owned an immense plantation of nearly 2300 acres on the northern coast of Puerto Rico, and a sugar mill with an advanced steam engine. His wealth and political connections gave him the power to convince the Spanish Colonial government in the island to split the municipality of Manati in two, and thus found the municipality of Barceloneta. The Hacienda La Esperanza steam engine has been designated a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark. Today the entire property is owned by the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust, which preserves and protects it, including some of the only coastal forest left in the region. Early years Fernández (birth name: José Ramon Fernández y Martínez) was one of three siblings born to Fernando Fernández and Francisca Martínez in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Fernández's father was a Spanish naval captain from Castile who fought against pirates and English merchant ships. In 1797, the Spanish Crown granted him large plots of land in the towns of Bayamon and Manati in recognition of his service to Spain. In Bayamon he planted sugar cane and raised cattle.Emma Stratton, \\"Hunter S. Thompson’s Puerto Rican Rum Diary\\" , Literary Traveler, 6 June 2007, accessed 5 November 2013 He named the property the \\"Santa Ana Plantation\\". Like other planters, he depended on imported African slaves for labor on the plantations. In 1804, the senior Fernández used a mixture of sugar and honey to process and distill rum. He aged his product in special barrels imported from Europe. The rum he produced was only for his own personal use and that of his family and friends, and he served it with pleasure. Fernández received his primary education in Puerto Rico. In 1819 when he was eleven years old, his father sent him to Spain for schooling and to study business. When he was seventeen, the young Fernández went to England to continue his education, where he became fluent in the English language. He went to the United States in his early twenties and continued his education in New York City. There he befriended various businessmen who in the future would help him in his commercial endeavors. Return to Puerto Rico Fernández returned to Puerto Rico in 1826 and helped his father to administer La Esperanza sugar plantation. He met and befriended George C. Latimer, the United States consul in San Juan. Together with Latimer, who was also a sugar broker, he founded Latimer & Fernández Co. The company, which was located in San Juan, was a distributor of sugar, molasses and rum, and also dealt with other commodities such as food and textiles. In 1827, Fernández ordered his 127 slaves to build an enormous windmill shaped like a tower. The windmill helped to extract the juice from the sugar canes. He still used manpower whenever the wind wasn't strong enough for to operate the windmill.Puerto Rico Herald, 2003 The senior Fernández did the same with his other plantation in Manati, which he named Hacienda La Esperanza.HACIENDA LA ESPERANZA: Steam Engine , National Historic Landmark of Mechanical Engineering, American Society of Mechanical Engineers According to Puerto Rican historian Federico Ribes Tovar, there were many instances when rival tribes in Africa would kidnap royal members of another tribe and sell them to slave traders. This was the case of one of Fernández's slave in 1832. He noticed that the slave in question received special treatment from his other slaves. When he found out about the slave's royal lineage, he sent him back to Africa.\\"Historia Cronologica De Puerto Rico: Desde El Nacimiento De La Isla Hasta El Año 1973\\"; by: Federico Ribes Tovar; Publisher: Plus Ultra Educational Publishers; page 250; ASIN: B0006CFVK6. Fernández married Clemencia Dorado y Serrano. They had four daughters, the youngest of whom died young. Their later marriages reflected the family's international connections: one daughter, Barbara, married the nephew of American George Latimer; another daughter married an Englishman. In 1834, Fernández decided to concentrate on his commercial interests instead of the agricultural ones. He established a warehouse in the town of Mayaguez on the west coast, where he moved with his family. It was for shipping to the Caribbean and Latin America. Political life Fernández became president of the \\"Partido Incondicional Español\\" (Unconditional Spanish Party), a conservative political party in Puerto Rico. He was appointed to several political positions. Because of his political views and status, he was in good political standing with Queen Isabella II of Spain and the Spanish- appointed government of the island; he favored the monarchy and the Spanish colonial government. He became involved with various businesses. In 1850, used his political influence to lobby for the establishment of a railroad line between San Juan and Arecibo, with the financial backing of Augusto de Cottes and Cornelio Kortwright. The improved transportation would help planters get their commodities to market. Marqués de La Esperanza steam engine and mill. It was designated a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1979. An 1868 uprising against the monarchs of Spain forced Queen Isabella II to go into exile in September of that year. This revolt, which deposed the queen, is known as the Glorious Revolution. It ushered the First Spanish Republic into power. After much deliberation, the new government replaced Isabella with Amadeo I, son of the Italian king.\\"Queen Isabella II\\", Women's History The new provisional government allowed its colonies to send representatives to the Spanish Court. Fernández was among those who represented Puerto Rico. On February 5, 1869, the Spanish government bestowed the title of \\"Marqués de La Esperanza\\" (Marquis of Hope, related to the name of his plantation) upon Fernández. When his father died, Fernández inherited La Esperanza, which at the time was one of the largest and the most technically advanced sugar plantations in Puerto Rico. \\"La Esperanza\\" was situated on 2,265 acres of land rich in alluvial deposits, an important element for the cultivation of sugar cane. By 1880, he controlled 80 percent of the valley. Fernández built the wealth of his plantation on the labor of ethnic African slaves who provided the manpower to cultivate and harvest the sugar cane on the plantation and to run the factory and mill. By the time of emancipation in 1873, Fernández owned 175 slaves. In the 1840s, he and his father had installed an advanced steam engine with two- flue boiler, purchased from the West Point Foundry of New York. Designated in 1979 as a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark, the steam engine is the The system includes an elaboration (Jamaican) train, conveyor belt, and four evaporators for processing of sugar cane. In a demonstration of his political influence, Fernández convinced the government to divide the municipality of Manati in two and found the new municipality of Barceloneta. This was clearly for his own economic benefit. If he used the port of Manati, Fernández would have to pay taxes for the movement of goods and slaves. In Barceloneta, he built his own port and was able to ship his commodities and products free of taxes. Legacy Fernández incurred many debts because of the money which he borrowed to mechanize his plantation. He was unable to pay his debts. When he died, his family became involved in a feud as to who was the rightful inheritor of the plantation. As two of the daughters had married foreigners (one married George Latimer's son), the third said she was the only rightful heir. As Fernandez' major creditor, the Colonial Company Ltd. claimed ownership of the land. In 1975, the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust acquired the Hacienda La Esperanza. La Esperanza is one of the most valuable assets of the Trust. The land includes varied terrain of karst, wetlands, forest, including some of the only coastal forest on the north coast, and river valley. In 1984 the conservation trust began work on the restoration of the plantation structures.Hacienda La Esperanza Rum Another of Fernando Fernández' sons inherited the property at Bayamon. His line has kept some of the property. Based on a son's education in France and learning about cognac aged in oak barrels, the family made changes to their rum-making process. In 1915, they started producing Ron del Barrilito (literally, rum from the little barrel) for commercial sales. Fernández descendants still produce this local brand of Puerto Rican rum at Bayamon.

It also housed the McGuffey Elementary Laboratory School, which came into existence in 1910, and which was and still used by the University for observation and practice teaching purposes. The laboratory school, consisting of kindergarten and twelve grades, was originally known as the \\"Normal College Model School of Miami University.\\" However within a year after it came into being (1911), the name of the school was changed to McGuffey Schools,\\" in honor of the man who organized the first teachers' training class in Ohio. The McGuffey Schools were located in the south section, and the building still was referred to as the South Pavilion of the Normal College Building. Until construction of the Central Pavilion in 1916, the South and North Pavilions were separate buildings. The North and Central Pavilions provided accommodations for work of the Teacher's College. In 1916-17 the entire Normal College Building was renamed \\"McGuffey Hall.\\" William Holmes McGuffey William McGuffey was a Miami professor of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew from 1826–32, a professor of mental philosophy, philology, and general criticism at Miami from 1832–36, and author of the famed McGuffey Eclectic Readers, which were widely used in schools throughout the nation during the last half of the 19th century.

The original building was constructed in 1909. Later additions and sections were erected years later. The use for the building was set to be the School of Education and Elementary Laboratory School. The total cost of the building was $364,000 with those funds coming from the state. The total square footage of the school is approximately 107,000 and the cubic footage approximately 1,290,000. In 1924-25 the south wing was extended eastward and a gymnasium occupied the upper two floors. Included in the building are an auditorium which seats 300, a gymnasium, a cafeteria, a library(Heckert), which contains the Alstetter Collection of Children's Books which is considered to be one of the best collections of children's books in America.

His aim was to create a song with strong melodies that would match the classics, and bring back the Christmas magic that he felt had been missing from the UK charts for decades. Haggerwood was disappointed by the yearly non- festive songs released by The X Factor finalists, and the protests that ensued which seemed more concerned with spiting Simon Cowell than bringing back Christmas songs. When writing the song, he recalled his own childhood in the early 1980s. \\"My Favourite Time of Year\\" evolves around a catchy, carol-like melody which weaves up and down the major scales of Eb and Bb. The song is piano-led with instrumentation that includes many traditional Christmas elements such as orchestral chimes, choral harmonies and string lines. The Florin Street Band Leigh Haggerwood's vision for the song included a Victorian-themed band. After several years of pitching the concept to major labels, who wouldn't compete with The X Factor, he eventually decided to fund it himself using his personal savings. He contacted his session musician friends and employed their services to record the song at Trevor Horn's Sarm Studios in London, England. He also hired The English Chamber Choir to perform the choral parts, and the song was recorded over seven days in August 2010. The large ensemble of musicians was collectively named The Florin Street Band and many of the musicians that performed on the recording also appeared in the music video. Music video Leigh's original vision for the song included a music video set in Victorian England. The intention was to depict a working class man walking through snow-lined streets looking in on the festivities, and after a long search, it was agreed that British director Nick Bartleet would direct the video. Blists Hill Victorian Town at Ironbridge Museum's in Shropshire was chosen as the location due to its authentic recreation of a Victorian street which would become Florin Street in the video. As the project evolved, respected cinematographer John Perez - known for his work on Coldplay's \\"Viva la Vida\\" and videos by Beyoncé and Rihanna - offered his services. Over 100 cast and crew gathered for the overnight shoot at Blists Hill in October 2010, and due to the tight budget, the video had to be shot relatively quickly. Reception Owing to the lack of a major record company backing, it was initially very difficult to promote the song. Mainstream radio stations were resistant to airing the record because \\"it wasn't coming from a major label\\" which is often a benchmark. However, the song and video gained minor prominence through social networking sites. Its initial release on 6 December 2010 peaked at 14 in the UK Indie Breakers Chart. In August 2011, the United States Army Band (known as \\"Pershing's Own\\") requested permission to arrange the song for their annual Christmas concerts at the DAR Constitution Hall in Washington D.C.. \\"My Favourite Time of Year\\" was requested for use in popular TV and radio shows and Leigh received requests to perform it from schools, choirs, orchestras, churches, theatrical productions and youth groups. The song has been supported by Jamie Oliver,Jamie Oliver site: Finally the festive charts get some Xmas with whom Haggerwood started a band named Scarlet Division in 1988. It won the UK Songwriting Contest Text Santa Elements of the song were chosen to accompany ITV's Christmas charity appeal, Text Santa; The producers were keen to use \\"My Favourite Time of Year\\" as the theme music to the appeal, which Leigh Haggerwood agreed to. With his experience as a media composer, he re-versioned the song and created other original music for the shows. Text Santa is a charity initiative first broadcast on UK television network, ITV, in 2011. The project aims to raise money and awareness for a selection of charities during the festive season and is heavily promoted by ITV in the form of TV shows, radio and sponsorship by brands such as Asda supermarkets and Vodafone. Follow-ups Florin Street Band released two follow-up Christmas singles with new videos prepared. The main vocals on both songs as in the case of the original song were by Leigh Haggerwood. The first song was released on 15 December 2013 titled \\"Winter Wonder\\". The music video was shot at Tithe Barn at Englishcombe.YouTube: Florin Street Band - \\"Winter Wonder\\" The song won Best Christmas Song and Best Music Video in the 2014 UK Songwriting Contest.

It is situated on the west side of the city, adjacent to Manitou Springs and south of U.S. Route 24. The park consists of a series of parallel ridges (called \\"hogbacks\\") and eroded canyons, a continuation of the same sandstone rocks of the Fountain Formation that make up Garden of the Gods a few miles to the north. Rather than being pristine conservation land, the park contains a number of reclaimed former industrial sites, including quarries, gravel pits, a gold refining mill, and a landfill. The land parcels were purchased piecemeal by John George Bock in the 1920s and 1930s, and acquired by the city of Colorado Springs in 2003 for use as a recreational site. Today the most visible scars from past exploitation of the land are the remains of the Kenmuir Quarry, which produced Lyons sandstone in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the Gypsum canyon landfill, which operated from 1970-1986 and remains off-limits to park visitors.

Indeed, unlike quisqualic acid, quisqualamine has central depressant and neuroprotective properties and appears to act predominantly as an agonist of the GABAA receptor and also to a lesser extent as an agonist of the glycine receptor, due to the facts that its actions are inhibited in vitro by GABAA antagonists like bicuculline and picrotoxin and by the glycine antagonist strychnine, respectively. Mg2+ and DL-AP5, NMDA receptor blockers, CNQX, an antagonist of both the AMPA and kainate receptors, and 2-hydroxysaclofen, a GABAB receptor antagonist, do not affect quisqualamine's actions in vitro, suggesting that it does not directly affect the ionotropic glutamate receptors or the GABAB receptor in any way.

He held a number of important offices within the colony, including Deputy, Assistant and Attorney General. He is most noted for being selected as Rhode Island's agent to England on two occasions, but never appears to have served in that role due to the indecision of the General Assembly. He played a prominent role in the affairs of the colony during an extremely turbulent time, when Rhode Island was threatened with losing its charter due to \\"irregularities\\" perceived by the English Board of Trade. Sheffield died at the age of 44, leaving a widow and several minor children.  Life  Born in Portsmouth, Rhode Island on 22 August 1661, Joseph Sheffield was the son of Ichabod Sheffield and Mary Parker. His father had been baptized 23 December 1630 in St. Peter's in Sudbury, Suffolk, England, the son of Edmund and Thomazin Sheffield. After living in Portsmouth, his father moved to Dover, New Hampshire, but returned to Newport, Rhode Island, and was buried in the Clifton Burying Ground there. Lord Bellomont was bent on removing Rhode Island from its chartered government for \\"irregularites,\\" some of which were addressed in letters which Sheffield helped draft. Joseph Sheffield is first found in the public record in 1684 when he was made a freeman of the colony, at the age of 23. He first began his public service 12 years later when he was selected as both a Deputy and an Assistant under Governor Samuel Cranston, serving in the latter role for seven years between 1696 and 1705. Sheffield was active during a critical time in Rhode Island's history, when the colony was being accused of numerous irregularities, and when it came the closest to losing its broad freedoms under the Royal Charter of 1663. The colony's irregularities were being feverishly documented by Lord Bellomont, who had collected volumes of documentary evidence. The feeling of the home government was expressed in a letter of August 1699 written by the Board of Trade in reply to a letter written by Governor Cranston in May. The language was very severe, blaming the colony, among other things, for sending only an abstract of the laws when a full copy was required. To address this deficiency, in October 1699 Sheffield and six others were appointed to make returns of the laws to satisfy the Earl of Bellomont's requests. In December 1699 a fair copy of the laws and acts of the colony was finally sent to the Earl, with a letter explaining the delay. Joseph Sheffield, as one of the Assistants, carried the letter with the purpose of being an envoy to soothe Bellomont's anger. In February 1700, Rhode Island's agent in England, Jaleel Brenton, was likely becoming overwhelmed with his responsibilities, and Sheffield was appointed as a second colonial agent. Three months later, however, the General Assembly decided that one agent in England was sufficient, so Sheffield remained in Rhode Island. Again in February 1703, with Brenton no longer in England, Sheffield was appointed as the colony's sole agent to England, and again, two months later, the Assembly saw no need for an agent there, and the appointment was delayed until the May meeting, at which time it was dropped from consideration. Another irregularity that concerned The Board of Trade in London was the extraordinary militia power of the Rhode Island colony, though this power had been conferred by the colony's charter In 1702 Governor Joseph Dudley of Massachusetts visited Newport, claiming to act under the authority of the King as \\"Captain-General of all forces, forts, and places of strength.\\" He demanded a review of the colonial militia, which was denied by Governor Cranston. In September 1702, Sheffield was appointed to a committee to draw up an address to the queen related to the colony's military forces. Using his experience of transcribing the laws of the colony, Sheffield and two others were appointed to draw up the methods and proceedings of the Court of Common Pleas in June 1703, and two years later he was on a committee to transcribe and print the laws of the colony. In 1704 he was chosen as the Attorney General for the colony, and held this position for two years, until his untimely death in February 1706. His will, written on 3 February and proved 15 days later, named his wife Mary as executrix, and named his children, who were all minors at the time.  Family  Joseph Sheffield's wife was Mary Sheriff, the daughter of Thomas and Martha Sheriff of Portsmouth. Following the death of Mary's father, her mother married Thomas Hazard, one of the founding settlers of Newport. Of Sheffield's children, his oldest daughter, Mary, married Samuel Arnold, a physician, the son of Caleb Arnold, also a physician, and the grandson of the first Governor of the Rhode Island colony, Benedict Arnold. A notable descendant of Joseph and Mary Sheffield, through their grandson, Joseph Arnold, was Stephen Arnold Douglas who debated Abraham Lincoln in 1858 before a senate race and later lost to him in the 1860 presidential election.

David Merrill,http://www.mdavidmerrill.com/ Professor Emeritus at Utah State University, is an instructional theory based on a broad review of many instructional models and theories.Merrill, M. D. (2002). First principles of instruction. Educational Technology Research and Development, 50(3), 43-59. (Click for copy from Dr. Merrill's personal website) First Principles of Instruction are created with the goal of establishing a set of principles upon which all instructional theories and models are in general agreement, and several authors acknowledge the fundamental nature of these principles.Instructional-Design Theories and Models, Volume III: Building a Common Knowledge Base (link to book site) These principles can be used to assist teachers, trainers and instructional designers in developing research- based instructional materials in a manner that is likely to produce positive student learning gains. The Principles First Principles of Instruction are described as a set of interrelated principles which, when properly applied in an instructional product or setting, will increase student learning. These principles include the following:Merrill, M. D. (2009). First Principles of Instruction. In C. M. Reigeluth & A. Carr (Eds.), Instructional Design Theories and Models: Building a Common Knowledge Base (Vol. III). New York: Routledge Publishers. (Click for copy)Merrill, M. D. (2007). First principles of instruction: a synthesis. In R. A. Reiser & J. V. Dempsey (Eds.), Trends and Issues in Instructional Design and Technology, 2nd Edition (Vol. 2, pp. 62-71). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Merrill/Prentice Hall. (Click for copy) * Task/Problem-Centered – Students learn more when the instruction is centered on relevant real-world tasks or problems, including a series of tasks or problems that progress from simple to complex. * Activation – Students learn more when they are directed to recall prior knowledge, to recall a structure for organizing that knowledge, or are given a structure for organizing new knowledge. This activation can also include a foundational learning experience upon which new learning can be based. * Demonstration – Students learn more when new knowledge is demonstrated to them in the context of real-world tasks or problems. The knowledge that is demonstrated is both informational and skill-based. Demonstration is enhanced when it adheres to research-based principles of e-learning. * Application – Students learn more when they perform real-world tasks or solve real-world problems and receive feedback and appropriate guidance during that application. * Integration – Students learn more when they are encouraged to integrate their new knowledge into their life through reflection, discussion, debate, and/or presentation of new knowledge. These principles can be used in a Task or Problem-Centered cycle of instruction beginning with Activation and continuing through Demonstration, Application, and Integration. First Principles of Instruction is similar to other task-centered instructional theories (e.g. Van Merriënboer’s Four Component Instructional Design Modelvan Merriënboer, J. J. G., Clark, R. E., and de Croock, M. B. M. (2002a). Blueprints for complex learning: The 4C/ID- model. Educ. Technol., Res. Dev. 50(2): 39–64.) in that it uses a real-world problem or task as a vehicle for instruction. Students view demonstrations of real-world problem solving examples, are given opportunities to solve real- world problems and are given feedback on their application. Students are taught new knowledge and information within the context of the real-world task or problem, which provides a context in which the knowledge is obtained. First Principles is different than problem-based-learning, however, in that it provides more guidance and demonstration to students which is reduced as students gain expertise. Research support There is a growing body of research support for Merrill's First Principles of Instruction. In one study, researchers surveyed 140 students at 89 different higher education institutions and discovered that students were 9 times more likely to report that they had mastered learning the course objectives when First Principles of Instruction were used and when they spent ample time and effort studying.Frick, T., Chadha, R., Watson, C., Wang, Y., & Green, P.

How Award-winning Professors in Higher Education Use Merrill's First Principles of Instruction. International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning, 8(5), p. 3-16).(link to article) In another study, researchers compared the effectiveness of instruction using First Principles of Instruction with more traditional instruction and found that students in the First Principles group learned significantly more and finished learning tasks significantly faster.Thomson.

After the Rhodesian Bush War ended in 1980, the Fullers moved to Malawi, and then to Zambia. Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight won the Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize in 2002, was a New York Times Notable Book for 2002 and a finalist for The Guardians First Book Award, an award given to the best regional novel of the year. Plot summary Alexandra Fuller's book tells the story of her family of white Zimbabwean tenant farmers in the years before and after Independence. These are not the wealthy landowners demonised by the present Zimbabwean government; they struggle to make a living off the land, as well as the usual hazards of the African bush, they fear landmines and attacks by guerrillas crossing the border from Mozambique. During the civil war, their parents join the police reserve. Bobo and her sister are warned not to come into their parents' bedroom in the night because they sleep with loaded guns. Then at Independence (1980), Bobo and her classmates are stunned to see black pupils far wealthier and more sophisticated than them joining their elite high school. Their farm is seized by the new government and awarded to political cronies under a land distribution programme and they move south to a much harsher ranch, where their diet is based on impala and brackish water from a borehole that is strictly rationed. From Zimbabwe, the Fullers move to Malawi, where they are closely watched by government agents, notably a houseboy who presents himself for employment and will not take 'no' for an answer. When Bobo's father jokingly describes his newly built beach hut on the shore of Lake Malawi as 'a palace', the houseboy makes his report and the carload of presidential officials who rush down to inspect it are furious to find a hut made of mud, poles and thatch. When the family moves on to Zambia, they have lived in every country in the former Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. With the resilience of childhood, Bobo takes extraordinary events in her stride. The politics and the everyday struggle to make a living from the land are mixed with family tragedy; a sister drowned, a brother dead from meningitis and another stillborn. The family handle their mother's alcoholism and insanity with the same stoicism they handle any other misfortune, though they do occasionally compare themselves to families with normal mothers, clean swimming pools, home baking and children free of worms.

Cort of the modern Indian Digambara intellectual tradition during the early 20th century. He was the founder of several schools and institutions of advanced learning including Syadvad Mahavidyalaya at Varanasi in 1905, Varanasi and Satark-Sudhataringini Digamber Jain Pathshala, now Ganesh Digamber Jain Sanskrit Vidyalaya at Sagar. Many of the Jain scholars today are products of the institutions found by Ganeshprasad Varni. Sahajananda Varni was one of his disciples. While Jinendra Varni never heard him speaking, he was deeply influenced by him and had compiled a volume \\"Varni Darshan\\" to commemorate Ganeshprasad Varni's birth centenary in 1975.  Early life  Ganesh Prasad Ji Varni was born to Hira Lal and Ujyari Devi in village Hansera in district Lalitpur (U.P.), who belonged to the Asati community. While the Asatis are mostly Vaishnava, his father had a deep faith in the Namokar Mantra.Meri Jivangatha He used to live in a Jain neighbourhood and visit the Jain temple near his house in Mandawara. Influenced by lectures there, at the age of ten, he took a vow to take meals before sunset throughout his life. During his yajnopavita ceremony, he had an argument with the priest and his mother, and declared that he will be a Jain henceforth. his He passed the middle examination at the age of fifteen. He did not have any aptitude for shop- keeping, his father's profession, and became a school teacher. He came into contact with a religious minded lady Chiranjibai of Simra through Karorelal Bhaiji, a spiritual man of Jatara. Samaj Ratna Shrimati Chironjabai Jain, PC Jain, Golalariya Darshan, Sept. 2011 She developed much affection for him and treated him like her son. She supported his desire of obtaining advanced religious education spiritual development.  Education  At that time there were no advanced scholars in the Bundelkhand region. He studied at Jaipur, Khurja, Bombay, Mathura, Varanasi and other places with great difficulty. Because of his lack of funds, he occasionally had to starve accept humiliations. he studied with Pt. Panna Lal Backliwal and Baba Gurdayal at Bombay to pass Ratnakarand Shravakachar and Katantra-panchsanndhiki examinations. There he also met Pt. Gopaldas Baraiya, with whom he studied Nyayadipika and Sarvarthsidhi after he had studied of Nyaya (logic) and grammar at Khurja. He was sometimes turned down by reputed Brahmin teachers. He studied under Pt. Ambadas Shastri at Varanasi. He then studied at Chakauti and Navadweep to acquire the Nyayacharya degree.  Establishment of Educational Institutions  Based on his experience of encountering the difficulties in obtaining advanced Jain education, he strongly felt the need for establishing Jain educational institution at Varanasi. He received a donation of one rupee from someone. He used it to by sixty-four postcards, and sent them to some potential Jain donors. With the assistance of prominent Jain philanthropists like Babu Devkumar of Arrah, Seth Manek Chand, J.P. of Bombay etc. he established the famous Syadwad Mahavidyalaya at Varanasi in 1905. Baba Bhagirath Varni served as the superintendent (supervisor) of the institution. Even though Ganeshprasad was a founder of the Syadvad Mahavidyalaya, he accepted the rules imposed by Bhagirath Varni. A number of influential Jain scholars have been a product of this institution. With the help of Pt. Motilal Nehru, he was able to get Jain studies introduced at Banaras Hindu University. Later with encouragement of Balchand Savalnavis, and the support of Kandya, Malaiya, and other families and Singhai Kundanlal etc. he helped establish the Satark-Sudhataringini Jain Pathshala which is now the well known Ganesh Digamber Jain Sanskrit Vidyalaya at Sagar.Sarvodayi Deshna, Suvrata Sagar Muni, 2011, p. 5 He also helped in establishing various institutions. After inspiring and helping establish these institutions, he left the administration to local volunteers, without bothering to remain in control, and moved on. Some of these institutions are: * Swadvada Mahavidyalaya Banares, जन्मोत्सव में बधाइयां, क्षमावाणी में केश लोंच, Bhaskar News Network, Sep 11, 2017 * Sri Kund Kund Jain (P-G) College, Khatauli, 1926. * Jain Higher Secondary School Sagar. * Mahavira Jain Sanskrit Uchchatar Madhamik Vidyalaya, Lalitpur, 1917. * Varni Jain Inter College, Lalitpur. * Shri Ganesh Prasad Varni Snatak Mahavidyalaya, Ghuwara. * Varni Jain Gurugul, Jabalpur. * Shri Parshwanath Brahmacharya Ashram Jain Gurukul, Khurai, 1944. * Pathshalas at Baruasagar, Dronagiri. * Digambar Jain mahila Ashram, Sagar इस आश्रम की बेटी काेई जज है ताे काेई आर्यिका, Patrika, Feb 2, 2017 श्री दिगंबर जैन महिलाश्रम में 76 वर्ष से दी जा रही बारहवीं तक मुफ्त शिक्षा, Bhaskar News Network, Jan 18, 2016 * Digambar Jain Udasin Ashram, Isri, जयंती पर स्कूली बच्चों ने निकाली प्रभातफेरी, Bhaskar News Network, Sep 10, 2017  Spiritual Passage  He led a simple and aesthetic life and dedicated himself to the study and teaching of Jain philosophy. He gradually adopted a life of renunciation. At Kundalpur, he took the brahmacharya vrata (celibacy), i.e. 7th pratima from Baba Gokuldas and thus came to be called a Varni. He took 10th pratima in 1944, and became a kshullak in 1947. He travelled extensively in India. He had donated his only wearing apparel, the Chadar, at a public meeting held in connection with Azad Hind Army at Jabalpur in 1945. It was immediately auctioned for Rs. 3000/- for raising the funds for the army. At the age of 87, sensing his impending end, he retired to Isri Udasin Ashram, near Sammet Shikhar which he had himself helped establish. He took the vows of a Jain Muni with the name Muni 108 Ganeshkirti. He died in his final meditation (Samadhi-maran) on 5 December 1961.Progressive Jains, Satish Kumar Jain  Works  His two-volume autobiography Meri Jevan Gatha has become a major source of information about the Jain society of his time. It is written in a fluid and very readable style. The recordings of his lectures on the Samayasar have been re-discovered and digitised. They have also been published as a book. A publishing house named Shri Ganeshprasad Varni Jain Granthmala, Varanasi, named after him has published a number of important Jain texts.

The Sun God TabletThe Sun God Tablet, BM 91000 i 24 – ii 17. of Nabu-apla-iddina relates that Ekur-šum-ušabši, the priest and seer appointed during the time of Simbar- šipak, complained that due to the “stress and famine under Kaššu-nādin-aḫi,” an intermediate monarch, \\"the temple offerings of Šamaš (had) ceased,\\" prompting Eulmaš-šākin-šumi to divert flour and sesame wine from that allocated to the god Bel and a garden in the new city district of Babylon for ongoing provisions. There is an inscribed Lorestān bronze sword and fifteen inscribed arrowheads, somewhat inappropriately inscribed with the title šar kiššati, \\"king of the world,\\" probably for use as votive offerings at temples rather than as offensive weapons.

He made his debut in 2005, reaching the top division six years later, debuting in the July, 2011 tournament. His highest rank was maegashira #8. He is now a sumo coach. Early life and sumo background At the behest of his older sister, Nakanishi started participating in a sumo club in his neighborhood from 4th grade. He later participated in inter-high school tournaments. As a student at Senshu University he won the open weight division championship. Upon graduating he joined Onomatsu stable and entered the professional sumo ring in March 2005. Professional career Nakanishi had a relatively trouble-free rise through the lower ranks. He took a 7-0 championship in both the jonokuchi and jonidan divisions in his first and second tournaments. He continued to post mostly winning records through 2005 and well into 2006, but began to struggle after reaching the higher ranks of the makushita division. He would then bounce back and forth between mid to high level makushita ranks, posting alternating winning and losing records, for the next two and a half years. He finally began to find some equilibrium in mid 2008, posting several consecutive winning tournaments. This streak was interrupted by a broken jaw that would force him to sit out the March 2008 tournament at what had been his highest rank to date at makushita #5. Though missing this tournament would send him back to makushita #45 in the next tournament, he did not let this slow him down and upon returning proceeded to post five consecutive winning tournaments, including one playoff loss for the championship in July 2009. As is often the custom, he chose his entry into jūryō to change his ring name from his family name to his current ring name of Daidō. The name he said comes from what he sees as the starting place of his way of sumo, his old junior high school, which is named Daidō. He entered the second tier jūryō division at the same time as Onomatsu stablemate in March 2010. This was the first time that two wrestlers from the same stable had been promoted to jūryō simultaneously since Kimurayama and Tochinoshin from Kasugano stable were promoted in January 2008. Daidō was the third wrestler from Senshu University to achieve sekitori status, following already retired Musoyama and Katayama, the latter of whom was also from the same stable. He made a smooth entry into jūryō posting two consecutive winning tournaments of 9-6 and 10-5. However, in the wake of an investigation by the national police into illegal baseball gambling by sumo wrestlers, Daidō was one of many wrestlers who admitted involvement. As punishment by the JSA Daidō was compelled to sit out the July 2010 tournament. This tournament would have been his highest rank yet at jūryō #2. This was an ironic repeat of his \\"debut\\" in the top ranks of makushita in 2008 where his injury had forced him to sit out. As another stipulation of the punishment, Daidō and others implicated were demoted by one division in the following September tournament. This would put Daidō back to makushita #1. He would manage a 4-3 winning record in this tournament and return to jūryō in the November tournament. He achieved three consecutive winning tournaments, interrupted only by the March tournament that was cancelled due to match fixing allegations. During this period, in the ongoing police investigation into baseball gambling, Daidō was implicated as one of four still active wrestlers who had used a gambling ring operated by then active sumo wrestlers from Onomatsu stable to place bets on baseball. The prosecutor recommended charges, but ultimately no indictments were handed down due to lack of compelling evidence. Daidō's performance was largely unaffected by the turmoil around the allegations and his successful tournaments earned him promotion to the top tier makuuchi division in July 2011. He debuted at maegashira #12, but soon ran into trouble, losing most of his early bouts. However, he improved enough during the second half of the tournament to pull out a 6-9 record. Though it was his first losing tournament since May 2008, it was a good enough result that he was only demoted to maegashira 15 for the following September tournament. An 8-7 record would return him to maegashira #12 for the November tournament where he would again achieve a winning record, ensuring a promotion to maegashira 9, for 2012's opening tournament. However, in his next three tournaments he narrowly failed to achieve winning records, with a 6–9 and two consecutive 7–8s. A disastrous 1–14 record in the July 2013 tournament saw him demoted back to the jūryō division, and he was never to return to makuuchi. Retirement from sumo Daidō dropped out of jūryō after the July 2015 tournament, and although he managed an immediate return, he lost sekitori status again after the November 2015 tournament. After scoring only one win in makushita in January 2016, he chose to retire. He remained in the sumo world as a coach at his stable, under the elder name of Onogawa Oyakata. His danpatsu-shiki, or official retirement ceremony was held on June 4, 2016 at the Ryogoku Kokugikan with 480 people in attendance. He revealed at the event that he has been married since December 2014. In January 2018, he became the owner of the Otowayama kabu, replacing ex-Otowayama Oyakata Kōbō, who had it on loan and left the Japan Sumo Association. In September 2019 he became the new Onomatsu Oyakata and head of the Onomatsu stable, swapping with ex- sekiwake Masurao who left the Sumo Association for health reasons. Fighting style Daidō preferred to fight on the opponent's mawashi or belt as opposed to pushing or thrusting. His favoured grip was migi-yotsu, with his left hand outside and right hand inside in his opponent's arms. His most common winning kimarite was uwatenage, or overarm throw, followed by yori-kiri or force out.

As a battalion commander of Royal Marines, Captain John Robyns faced enemy forces which included his counterparts of the United States Marines at Bladensburg, Washington, Baltimore, and New Orleans. In his later years Robyns served one term as Mayor of Penzance (1840–41) in his native Cornwall. Early Life and career John Robyns, the son of Thomas Robyns, was christened in the Parish of Madron, in West Cornwall, on 13 May 1780. The private christening, performed by a midwife, probably occurred soon after his birth, if not on the actual day of birth.Search Results-FamilySearch.org-Free Family History and Genealogy Records Note(a):Spelling of father's name given as \\"Thomas Robins\\"West Penwith Resources-Madron & Penzance Baptisms 1756–1888 (4)- Note(b):Spelling recorded variously as \\"Robins\\" or \\"Robyns\\"in document collection cited. It may be assumed that young Robyns received an adequate common school education that was sufficient to prepare him for a commission. He may have served in the Royal Navy or British Army prior to 1796. It is difficult to document this period of his life with precision. Robyns received his commission as a second lieutenant of His Majesty's Marine Forces in 1796. Soon afterwards he was ordered to the East Indies where he remained on station nearly five years, earning his promotion to first lieutenant in 1799. Following his return, shortly prior to the Treaty of Amiens, he was sent to Ireland where he remained on station until his promotion to captain in 1807. John Robyns was thus still a subaltern when H.M. Corps of Marine Forces was elevated to the dignity of Royal Marines on 29 April 1802. In 1808 Captain Robyns of the Marines sailed for Barbados as part of the expedition under Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane and Lieutenant General George Beckwith. Invasion of Martinique In 1809 Captain John Robyns participated in the British Invasion of Martinique, a highly successful amphibious operation.Captain H.G.

Robyns commanded a 400-strong composite battalion of Royal Marines and Royal Navy personnel in the Battle of Bladensburg, the Burning of Washington, and in the Battle of Baltimore.Crawford, p273, quoting a memo from Rear Admiral Codrington to Respective Captains dated 11 Sept 1814, which allocates the command of the marines from HMS Tonnant, HMS Ramillies, HMS Albion & HMS Royal Oak to Captain Robyns At Baltimore Robyns was severely wounded while leading his battalion on 12 September 1814. The British Army commander, Major General Robert Ross, was killed in the same action. Writing from , to the Admiralty Lords on 17 September 1814, Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane singled out the \\"frequently gallant conduct\\" of Robyns as worthy of special \\"favour and protection\\".  Battle of New Orleans  Following the defeat at Baltimore, Robyns was brevetted a major on the British Army List. Though still recovering from a wound described as \\"severe,\\" he accompanied the British expeditionary force which was sent to engage in the Battle of New Orleans. Once again charged with a composite command, he commanded a company in the \\"composite battalion\\" of 100 Marines commanded by his senior, Brevet Major Thomas Benjamin Adair (1783–1849), of the Royal Marines. Adair's 100 Royal Marines and a similar- sized party of Edward Nicolls' Red Sticks were brigaded with Colonel William Thornton (British Army officer)'s 85th Regiment of Foot (Bucks Volunteers). Thornton's Brigade performed laudably at New Orleans, overwhelming the American line on the west bank of the Mississippi.

Business model  Borrowers seeking small business or SBA loans, mortgage refinancing, line of credit or home equity loans, working capital financing, debt consolidation or other unsecured consumer loans submit “loan projects” via Weemba's website. Weemba utilizes a “social community” type format wherein borrowers are encouraged to create and populate a profile as well as their loan project and have the option to use their Facebook in relation to their profile. Weemba also uses “unique proprietary methods and state-of-the-art safeguards TO “exponentially increases the likelihood of successful financial outcomes for its members, both borrowers and lenders.” Besides the reason for and amount of a loan, borrower profiles may include information like income, education level and veteran status (individuals) to their number of employees, annual sales or revenue and articles of incorporation (businesses). Borrowers are encouraged to populate their project with as much current information as possible to increase the likelihood of attracting a lender's attention. At no times does Weemba obligate any borrower to include information they are not comfortable providing, including a credit score. Lenders search projects created by borrowers and narrow them down by credit score, amount needed, location, type of loan and other criteria. When a lender finds a loan project that interests them, the lender messages the borrower for access to their real identity and private details about the project. The lender pays Weemba a flat fee to facilitate this; borrowers pay Weemba nothing to participate. The borrower and lender then directly negotiate to create a new loan without Weemba's further involvement and outside the Weemba platform/website. Unlike peer-to-peer lending sites, Weemba's lenders are banks and professional lending institutions, not individuals. Weemba is neither a bank itself nor a lending broker. While lending brokers match borrowers with lenders and may negotiate loan terms between the parties, Weemba does not directly finance loans or hold the borrower's assets at any point.

Etymology The word \\"lithoprotection\\" originates from the Greek root \\"lithos\\", meaning \\"stone\\", and the Latin root \\"protectus\\", meaning \\"to cover\\". Definition Originally an existence of a lithoprotection had been proposed based on observations of increased plant and animal diversity in habitats with rock cover compared to habitats without rock cover in the same conditions of an arid climate and steep slopes Safarian Kh. 1960. An effect of rock-cover on the soil erosion, soil humidity and growth and development of plants. Agricultural Science Newsletter, (Teghek. Gjugh. git.), 8, pp. 25-32.Tadevosyan T.L. 2001. Lythoprotection of the Biodiversity in Arid Regions of Armenia.V-th conference of young scientist in Pushino. Biology - science of the 21st century. Puschino, p. 298. (In Russian). (Safarian, 1960; Tadevosyan, 2001). To explain this phenomenon, the author compared the life forms of plants, and the body sizes and escape strategies of animals inhabiting habitats with and without rock cover Tadevosyan, T.L. (2001): Ex Situ conservation psammophilic species of the flora and plant communities of Ararat Valley. PhD thesis. Institute of Botany, Yerevan, Nation. Acad. Sci. Rep. Arm. (In Russian).(Tadevosyan, 2001 - 2002). His conclusion was that many groups of vascular plants, including trees, shrubs, succulents, ferns, and moss species, linked to rocky substrates because they require higher than an area's average soil humidity, sometimes being shaded by a solid piece of rock, as well as strong attachment to the substrate. On the other hand, many relatively large animals (including larger lizards, snakes, some mammals and many bird species) need habitats with a dense network of shelters created by crevices and spaces between rocks in order survive overheating and predation. Thus, due to its ability to prevent the evaporation of humidity from the soil, to catch the seeds of plants, to hold trees and shrubs securely to the ground and to serve as a network of efficient shelters for many animals and shade-loving plants, rock cover lithoprotection is being considered as a protective element of a habitat biodiversity. Conservation Managing lithoprotection may be used as a measure of managing wildlife. Removal of a lithoprotection by cleaning an area of stone and rocks is a common practice in an urban landscape development. Because a lack of lithoprotection is equal to decreased biodiversity, this practice can be considered one of the core mechanisms of biodiversity loss in urban landscapes. Adding lithoprotection in contrary typically attracts wildlife and helps diversify and maintain biodiversity of a landscape (Tadevosyan, 2001). Bright examples of artificial use of lithoprotection are attractive rockeries, Japanese rock garden and other elements of a garden design.

The battle occurred at Radzymin, some north-east of Warsaw. Pre-battle Following the Battle of Raszyn on April 19, the Polish forces commanded by Prince Józef Poniatowski left Warsaw undefended and withdrew to several fortresses located nearby (most notably to Modlin Fortress and Serock). The Austrians seized the Polish capital relatively easy, but it was a pyrrhic victory, as the Austrian force was now seriously overstretched and had a still unbeaten enemy in the vicinity of Warsaw, as well as new Polish forces gathering strength behind their lines in Greater Poland. Prince Este garrisoned Warsaw with 10,000 soldiers, and split his remaining forces, sending some 6,000 troops under Gen. Johann Friedrich von Mohr to the right bank of the Vistula, and the rest towards Toruń and other targets on the left bank. Kamil Rosiak, W sto dziewięćdziesiąt lat po zgonie księcia Pepi... – część 2, Avatarea, 12/2003 The borough of Praga, located right across the Vistula from Warsaw, was initially left in Polish hands, garrisoned by a small force of 600 men. Mohr's force crossed the river near Karczew and on April 24 besieged the small Polish garrison of Praga. However, the following day the besiegers were assaulted from the back by a Polish division-sized sortie from the Modlin Fortress under Gen. Michał Sokolnicki. In what became known as the Battle of Grochów, the spearhead of the Austrian force was defeated and the Poles withdrew successfully. Simultaneously, further to the north-east, at Radzymin, a Polish force mounted yet another attack on overstretched Austrians. The town was held by relatively small Austrian forces consisting of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions from the 63rd Graf Baillet Infantry Regiment (under Ludwig Graf Baillet de Latour, younger brother of Field Marshal Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour) and a detachment of hussars. The Polish force was similar in size and consisted of a squadron of uhlans under Capt. Piotr Strzyżewski and a single infantry battalion from the 6th Infantry Regiment under Julian Sierawski. The force was supported by a single 2-gun battery of mounted artillery. Andrzej Tyszka, Robert Bielecki – \\"Dał nam przykład Bonaparte, wspomnienia i relacje żołnierzy polskich 1796–1815\\", tom I, Wydawnictwo Literackie Kraków, 1984. The Battle Overnight of April 24 the Polish force left Serock and crossed the Narew, reaching Radzymin before daylight. In the early hours of April 25 the force attacked the town from two sides and commenced a synchronised attack. The Austrians withdrew to the town's centre, but soon their cavalry was forced to retreat and the infantry battalions were now isolated. After a brief close quarters fight, the two Austrian battalions with their remaining 37 officers surrendered. Result and aftermath The losses for the Polish side were 19 killed and 27 wounded. The losses for the Austrians included approximately 2,000 prisoners of war and many killed and wounded. Although the battle was not a decisive defeat for the Austrians, it was one of a series of skirmishes they lost on the eastern bank of Vistula. Finally on May 2 and May 3 the entire corps under Gen. Mohr was defeated at Ostrówek and its pontoon bridge across the river was destroyed, thwarting any further attempts to advance further east. This gave Poles enough time to leave the Austrians locked in Warsaw to their fate and liberate much of Galicia without much opposition from the enemy.

It is located northeast of Lancefield, off Powells Track, north of Romsey and from Melbourne. Known as Wil-im-ee Moor-ring, meaning \\"axe place\\" in the Woiwurrung language, the greenstone quarry was an important source of raw material for the manufacture of greenstone ground-edge axes, which were traded over a wide area of south-east Australia.Archaeological site at Mount William Lancefield Australia, Romsey Australia Description The Mount William Aboriginal stone axe quarry comprises the remains of hundreds of mining pits and the mounds of waste rock where Aboriginal people obtained greenstone (diabase), and manufactured stone blanks for axe heads. Chipped and ground stone axes or hatchets were an essential part of Aboriginal toolkits in southeast Australia, with the Mount William greenstone being one of the most prized and extensively traded materials. The stone was quarried from the source outcrops, and roughly flaked into blanks, then taken away for finer flaking and grinding the edge.Coutts & Miller, 1977:1; Goodison, 1996:1 There are 268 mining pits, 18 of which are several metres deep,McBryde, 1984b:273-274 surrounded by at least 34 discrete flaking floors, with mounds of debris up to 20 metres in diameter and some featuring a central outcropping rock used as an anvil.McBryde, 1976:168 Mount William lies within one of six Cambrian greenstone belts in Victoria where several other greenstone quarries have also been found including Mount Camel, Howqua River, Cosgrove, Jallukar, Berrambool and Baronga on the Hopkins River; and Ceres and Dog Rocks near Geelong.McBryde & Watchman, 1976:166 However, none of the axes at Mount William have been ground and polished into finished hatchet heads.Coutts & Miller, 1977 The nearest axe grinding grooves can be found at Mount Macedon, about 29 kilometres away, where analysis of stone fragments showed they were the same diabase stone as the Mount William greenstone.West, 1972:198-200 History William Bradley appears to have been the first to describe the exchange of Mount William stone on 12 November 1838: In 1854 William Blandowski, the first zoologist at the Melbourne Museum, visited Mount William and provided the first written description: The celebrated spot which supplies the natives with stone (phonolite) for their tomohawks, and of which I had been informed by the tribes 400 miles distant. Having observed on the tops of these hills a multitude of fragments of stones which appeared to have been broken artificially. Here I unexpectedly found the deserted quarries (kinohahm) of the aboriginals... which extend over an area of upwards of one hundred acres, present an appearance somewhat similar to that of a deserted goldfield, and convey a faithful idea of the great determination displayed by the aboriginals.Blandowski, 1855:56 in McBryde & Watchman, 1976:169 William Buckley, described a hard black stone he called Kar-keen which was shaped into stone heads.Brough-Smyth, 1876:360 In the 1880s prominent Wurundjeri leader and custodian of the quarry, William Barak (who probably witnessed the final operations at the quarry) described the traditional ownership and access conventions to ethnographer, Alfred Howitt. Organised excursions were popular in the early 1900s, as when the District Teachers Association organised an excursion in 1906 and the day was \\"proclaimed a public holiday in the Shire of Lancefield (sic), so that an opportunity will be afforded to all to be present.\\"Lancefield Mercury, 1906, in Goodison, 1996:21 In the 1940s, Fred McCarthy identified a south-east Australia route associated with Mount William among his seven trunk-trade routes. In the 1960s and 1970s, Mt William drew the attention of anthropologists and archaeologists (notably including Donald Thomson and Isabel McBryde).Paton, 2005:280; McBryde, 2000:250 McBryde's study of trade systems in the 1970s included investigation of the distribution of axes from Mount William and other quarries in Victoria and New South Wales drawing on ethno-historical sources, linguistic and archaeological evidence and petrological studies (using thin section analysis for axes from archaeological sites and stone sources), to reveal distribution trends and social value.McBryde, 1984a; 1984b; McBryde & Watchman, 1976; McBryde & Harrison, 1981 McBryde showed Aboriginal exchange networks for Mount William stone extended several hundred kilometres.McBryde, 1978:355 with distribution determined by the social and political relations between the Kulin and neighbouring groups: sparsely distributed or absent in south-eastern Victoria but more widely distributed in Western Victoria.McBryde, 1984b:269, 279 Management and conservation Mount William had long been recognised as a special Aboriginal place when the first attempt was made to provide some formal protection in 1910. The Director of the Museum of Victoria, Baldwin Spencer, sought to establish a committee in association with the Historical Society of Victoria to purchase a portion of the area to form a reserve. However the landowner declined to sell.Mulvaney and Calaby, 1985: 260-261; Goodison, 1996:22 In 1917 Alexander F. Cameron, Member for Dalhousie in the Victorian Parliament considered that: Something like twenty-five acres of land could be procured at a reasonable price, and fenced in, to be held for all time as the great historic landmark of Australia, furnishing the only indication or proof that we have that this country was inhabited for hundreds of years before the white man came here,Mr Alexander F. Cameron, Member for Dalhousie Victorian Parliamentary Debates: Legislative Assembly Vol. 147: 1917; Paton, 2005:278 In 1918 Cameron sought an appropriation to purchase the land,Victorian Parliamentary Debates: Legislative Assembly vol 151 1918; Paton, 2005:278 and again in 1919.Victorian Parliamentary Debates: Legislative Assembly 1919; Paton, 2005:278 Then in 1921 Cameron reported to Parliament that a gentleman in Melbourne [offered] 300 pounds towards the purchase of that land as a reserve. He wished it to be handed over to the State or to some organisation. However, Cameron fell seriously ill shortly after and died in December 1923, so that no further action was taken.Paton, 2005: 279 In 1969, the landowner, a Mr Powell, became concerned about damage to the site, and offered to sell a portion of CA 24 to the Shire of Romsey. The Shire obtained financial support from the Victorian government in 1971 and the title was transferred in 1972. In 1976, an archaeological area was declared under the Archaeological and Aboriginal Relics Preservation Act 1972 over the council- owned land and the adjoining privately owned CA 16A to the north.Goodison, 1996:24-27National Heritage Place citation In 1997 the Shire of Romsey (now Macedon Ranges Shire Council) gifted their land to the Indigenous Land Corporation, which subsequently put the site under the management of the Wurundjeri Tribe Land Compensation and Cultural Heritage Council, It has also been included on the Register of the National Estate and the Australian National Heritage List.Australian Heritage Database National Heritage List Mount William Stone Hatchet Quarry Place ID:105936 File No:2/06/078/0002 Geographical location * Mount William * Mount William south west * Mount William north east .

Jamuna is equipped with a helicopter, a Bofors 40 mm gun, four survey motor boats, and two small boats. The ship has the distinction of being associated with relief work in the wake of the Gujarat earthquake, Tsunami 2004, as well as Operation Vijay during the Kargil war. Jamuna was also awarded a Mention in Dispatches. Ship history Built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers and commissioned into the Naval service at Kochi in 1991, Jamuna is the Indian Navy's third hydrographic survey ship of the s to have been indigenously designed and constructed. The ship is the namesake of , a sloop, which served in the Royal Indian Navy (RIN) during World War II. The new Jamuna is equipped with a range of surveying, navigational and communication systems. The next-generation surveying systems provided onboard include the multi-beam swath echo sounding system, differential global positioning system, motion sensors, sea gravimeter, magnetometer oceanographic sensors, side scan sonars, and an automated data logging system. These are designed to meet the stringent international/ISO 9002 digital survey accuracy standards required for the production of electronic navigation charts and publications as laid down by the International Hydrographic Organisation. The primary tasks of INS Jamuna include hydrographic surveys, nautical chart preparation, cartography, and training. The ship is also equipped with ROV, AUV and USV, similar to other sister ships of the Sandhayak class. Jamuna is powered by two diesel engines and is capable of sustained speeds. The ship is one of the most versatile survey vessels in the world. It can undertake a variety of tasks under trying conditions. After the tsunami of 2004, INS Jamuna undertook relief operations for the people of Sri Lanka when it was converted into a hospital ship. Search for INS Khukri INS Jamuna was instrumental in locating the wreckage of , a British Type 14 (Blackwood-class) frigate of the Indian Navy, which was the first warship sunk in action by a submarine since World War II. The ship sunk off the coast of Diu, Gujarat, India by the Pakistan Navy Daphné-class submarine on 9 December 1971 during the Indo-Pakistani War. Furthermore, it also remains the post-Independence era Indian Navy's only warship to be lost in war to date. Between 4 February and 6 February 2009, INS Jamuna was dispatched to search for Khukri. The survey ship deployed its side scan sonar, to take a picture of the bottom of the sea. One of the images obtained was of a large silt-covered hump on the seabed. This was located below the sea surface and close to Khukris last reported position. Jamunas magnetometer also confirmed the presence of steel inside this hump. The object was nearly long, had a north-east-southwest orientation and seemed to be sitting on its keel with its mast sticking out of the silt, confirming that it was the sunken ship. Survey work In 2013, INS Jamuna conducted a hydrographic survey off the Kenya coastline on the request of the Kenyan government to survey Manda Bay and Kiwaiyu Bay. Subsequently, the \\"first updated navigational charts\\" of the areas were presented to Kenyan authorities in 2014 by the Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral RK Dhowan. The ship also conducted a hydrographic survey off the Dar es Salaam port in Tanzania. Ship upgrade INS Jamuna is set for refit/upgrade by Reliance Defence and Engineering as part of the Rs 300 crores, 3 naval warship refit deal the company won in 2016. The refit is to be carried out at a facility at Pipavav in Gujarat. Apart from INS Jamuna, the two other warships to be refit are fleet tanker and offshore patrol vessel . The refit work is expected to be completed by April 2017.

The experts at WoRMS place this group of species in the family Conidae, the cone snails, but some other experts placed previously the genus in a proposed family, the Conilithidae. This is a monotypic genus. Use of this genus in the binomial name of this species was, until 2015, treated by the experts at WoRMS as an \\"alternative representation\\" of the species. (When the \\"alternative representation\\" was not used, this species was still placed in the Linnaean genus Conus.) In 2015 Puillandre et al. placed Conus californicus as the sole member of its own genus as Californiconus californicus This species has always been considered a species with unique characteristics within Conidae, because it shows diverging molecular (including toxicological) and morphological characteristics. Its generalist diet includes fish, other molluscs and worms, contrary to what is the case in other cone snail species, which have more specialized diets. Distinguishing characteristics The Tucker & Tenorio taxonomy distinguishes Californiconus from Conus in the following ways:Tucker J.K. & Tenorio M.J. (2009), Systematic Classification of Recent and Fossil Conoidean Gastropods, ConchBooks, Hankenheim, Germany, 295 pp. * Genus Conus sensu stricto Linnaeus, 1758 :: Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The basic shell shape is conical to elongated conical, has a deep anal notch on the shoulder, a smooth periostracum and a small operculum. The shoulder of the shell is usually nodulose and the protoconch is usually multispiral. Markings often include the presence of tents except for black or white color variants, with the absence of spiral lines of minute tents and textile bars. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radula has an elongated anterior section with serrations and a large exposed terminating cusp, a non-obvious waist, blade is either small or absent and has a short barb, and lacks a basal spur. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the Indo-Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species eat other gastropods, including cones. * Genus Californiconus Tucker & Tenorio, 2009 ::Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The protoconch is multispiral, the shell is turgid in profile, short, squat and rounded. The shell may be sculpted with spiral lines, but can be relatively smooth. The anterior notch is slight or absent, and the anal notch is shallow. The periostracum is smooth, and the operculum is large. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossils) :::The radular tooth is unique in that it has no basal spur, and the radula has five barbs: three barbs on the underside of the tooth, and two barbs on the topside, with one located near the blade, and the other near the shaft. A blunt shaft fold is located just posterior to the waist. The radular tooth does not have an accessory process. ::Geographical distribution :::There is one species in this genus, and it is found only in the Eastern-Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These cones are generalists. They are: molluscivorous (they prey on gastropods and bivalves); vermivorous (they prey on polychaete marine worms); and piscivorous (the also prey on fish).Duda, T.F., Jr., Kohn, A.J., & Palumbi, S.R.

(2005) Piscivorous behavior of a temperate cone smail, Conus californicus. The Biological Bulletin 209:146-153. Species list This list of species is based on the information in the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) list. Species within the genus Californiconus include only: * Californiconus californicus Reeve, 1844 Significance of \\"alternative representation\\" Prior to 2009, all cone species were placed within the family Conidae and were placed in one genus, Conus. In 2009 however, J.K. Tucker and M.J. Tenorio proposed a classification system for the over 600 recognized species that were in the family. Their classification proposed 3 distinct families and 82 genera for the living species of cone snails, including the family Conilithidae. This classification was based upon shell morphology, radular differences, anatomy, physiology, cladistics, with comparisons to molecular (DNA) studies. Published accounts of genera within the Conidae (or Conilithidae) that include the genus Californiconus include J.K. Tucker & M.J. Tenorio (2009), and Bouchet et al. (2011). Testing in order to try to understand the molecular phylogeny of the Conidae was initially begun by Christopher Meyer and Alan Kohn,Interview of Professor Alan Kohn, Professor Emeritus, Zoology and is continuing, particularly with the advent of nuclear DNA testing in addition to mDNA testing. However, in 2011, some experts still prefer to use the traditional classification, where all species are placed in Conus within the single family Conidae: for example, according to the 2011 version of the World Register of Marine Species, all species within the family Conidae are placed within the genus Conus. The binomial names of species in the 82 cone snail genera listed in Tucker & Tenorio 2009 are recognized by the World Register of Marine Species as \\"alternative representations.\\" http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=14107 Classification: Traditionally, all cone shells have been included in the Linnaean genus Conus. Tucker & Tenorio (2009) have recently proposed an alternative shell- and radula-based classification that recognizes 4 families and 80 genera of cones. In WoRMS, we currently still recognize a single family Conidae (following Puillandre et al. 2011), but Tucker & Tenorio's 80 genera classification is presented as \\"alternative representation\\".

Los Angeles artist and writer Doug Harvey notes that his paintings allow us \\"to see the places we overlook every day and to recognize that, in spite of its ominous industrial overtones, the city is shot through with a luminous, electric vitality and a psychological potency verging on the mythic.\\" Described as a \\"master of color and composition,\\" his \\"evocative, moody paintings teemed with life.\\" Early life and education Doolin was born in Hartford, Connecticut, and moved with his parents and brother to the suburbs of Philadelphia when the artist was seven. The New England landscapes he encountered summering in Vermont would later prove influential in his work. During his primary school years, as the U.S. engaged in World War II, he became fixated with images of military hardware and battle scenes. As young as ten years old, the artist \\"worked through foreshortening issues\\" [with wing positions in aerial dogfight drawings] and \\"mastered the principles of perspective.\\" Complex perspective would become a dominant motif throughout his career. His father, a successful insurance salesman, wanted his son to follow him in a business career, but in 1950, Doolin applied to the University of Vermont with the intention of pursuing a liberal arts education. However, a teacher encouraged him to apply to Philadelphia's University of the Arts and he was awarded a full scholarship. The University of the Arts \\"provided him with a strong foundation and a new attitude about the value of art\\" and he credited the school with fostering his individual style. Travel and influences The wide open spaces and vast scale Doolin encountered on a cross-country trip to the Rocky Mountains in his late teens opened the artist to new possibilities and experiences, and sparked three successive summers of hitchhiking excursions to Chicago and California, respectively. The latter two trips enabled him to assimilate both the natural beauty of Yosemite and the colorful and sometimes gritty cityscapes of San Francisco. In 1954, stationed in Germany with the U.S. Army, Doolin enjoyed his first taste of Europe. This included visits to Munich's Haus der Kunst and Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Discharged from the army in 1957, Doolin moved to New York and worked as a freelance commercial artist in advertising for the next four years, creating art in his limited spare time. Despite the cultural stimulation New York offered, Doolin was unsatisfied professionally and artistically, and took on extra work to save money for an extended trip to Europe in 1961. Doolin subsequently embarked on what might best be described as a cultural pilgrimage to some of the major art and historical centers of Europe. The artist was particularly influenced by works of Dutch and Italian Renaissance masters and contemporary abstract artists. Re-energized, Doolin settled into a rented a house on the island of Rhodes and painted, inspired by the mosaics he had viewed throughout southern Europe, and most notably, Ravenna, Italy. His work during this period featured jewel-like patterns and bright colors. The \\"frontal structure\\" and \\"flattened space\\" of these smaller paintings would become enduring influences in his later work. While in Greece, Doolin met and later married Leslie Edwards, a young Australian woman. The artist, returning to New York stimulated by his marriage and extended stay in Europe, was now \\"fiercely determined to be a painter.\\" Artificial landscapes Returning to New York, Doolin again worked as a commercial artist, painting in his spare time. Inspired by Al Held and other Hard-Edge painters, he began working on a series of \\"geometric abstract paintings that would become known as Artificial Landscapes.\\" These landscapes dealt with man-made as opposed to natural environments, and \\"related directly to the streetscapes of his [Greenwich Village] neighborhood - road signs, building walls, darkened doorways, and billboards from the semi-industrial area close to the docks.\\" These works were \\"often divided horizontally and compartmentalized into blocks of geometric patterns to reflect the flat, bold forms within the urban landscape.\\" The artist achieved a greater sense of artificiality using \\"harsh, inorganic colors absent from nature.\\" In 1965, at the suggestion of his wife, the couple and their two sons moved to her native Melbourne, where the artist took a teaching position and where in 1966, at Gallery A, he secured his first solo exhibition. The critical response was largely unfavorable. Doolin fared much better in Sydney, a city at that time more receptive to the New York-inspired aesthetic of the period, with a well-received exhibition of his Artificial Landscapes at Central Street Gallery in 1967. Wanting to further his education in order to secure a better teaching position in the future, the Doolin family moved to Los Angeles shortly after his Sydney show, and Doolin soon enrolled in the MFA program at the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1968, he was asked to participate in The Field, the inaugural exhibition for the reopening of the National Gallery of Victoria. He sent three new paintings which were highly praised by several critics, and subsequently acquired by Australia's three principle art museums. In 1969, he began painting a new series of \\"luminous and ethereal\\" Artificial Landscapes with a \\"minimalist aesthetic\\" known as the Arch Series. Central Street Gallery contacted Doolin in 1970 to mount a second show, and he sent nine of his new Artificial Landscapes. This show was an unqualified critical and financial success. Western landscapes In Los Angeles, Doolin's work became more representational, following his desire to create \\"more 'traditional' illusionistic paintings from direct observation.\\" The artist spent much of his two years at UCLA \\"painting illusionistically -- observed reality, dreams, fantasies, and memories.\\" The following year, he became an instructor at the university while furthering his exploration of illusionistic painting. Photorealism and Conceptual Art had emerged to become two of the dominant styles during this period, and both of these movements influenced the artist's epic work Shopping Mall. Doolin spent four years (1973–77) working on this piece, \\"a large-scale, detailed aerial view of the intersection of Arizona Avenue and Third Street in Santa Monica -- which established his reputation as an important contemporary interpreter of the Western landscape.\\" The artist \\"spent the first two years sketching and photographing the site from every possible rooftop vantage point, then constructed a highly detailed diagonal composition of a busy intersection.\\" The painting was the principle work of a solo exhibition at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery at Barnsdall Park in 1977, garnering enthusiastic reviews. The piece was then sent on a national tour of Australia in 1978, with stops in seven cities. In 1980, on the heels of this latest success and the dissolution of his marriage, Doolin was awarded a three-year Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship, which allowed the artist to relocate to a remote stretch of the Mojave Desert to paint. \\"The austere beauty of the desert had fascinated him since his hitchhiking trips west in the 1950s\\" and he found inspiration for his art during this period by drawing on the unique elements of the desert landscape. He returned to the urban environment of Los Angeles in 1983, and by the 1990s he had begun documenting the city, painting many of his best known works. In his signature rendering of \\"negative social spaces -- bus stops, empty billboards, the dry trough of the L.A. River, the concrete islands between freeway onramps,\\" the artist achieved an unlikely marriage between the \\"lurid sublimity of California landscape tradition\\" and \\"postindustrial apocalyptic melancholy.\\". Collections, awards and reputation Doolin's art work is included in many public and corporate collections and is also represented in numerous books on America.\\" He was the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and three National Endowment for the Arts grants in 1981, 1986, and 1992. Throughout his career, Doolin struggled against \\"the L.A. art establishment's prejudice against pictorialism and regionalism,\\" but he eventually earned the respect of critics, collectors and fellow artists. Australian writer Peter Carey noted that Doolin was a \\"risk- taker, [whose] choice of subject matter was often unfashionable.\\" Upon Doolin's death, artist Carl Cheng described him as a West Coast Edward Hopper, capturing \\"both the beauty and the alienation of our time in Los Angeles.\\" After his masterful, incandescent painting Psychic headlined the traveling exhibition \\"Representing L.A.,\\" (2000–2002) and the San Jose Museum of Art held a retrospective of his work in 2001, his reputation as a major Los Angeles artist solidified.

A secondary aspect of their business was focused on providing location-aware coupons and curated to users in Atlanta. The site provided deals to local food and drink venues as well as shops. History Local Deals Scoutmob was founded in 2010 by David Payne and Michael Tavani as an offshoot of another Atlanta-based company that provided customized wifi accounts to local businesses. The company started providing the local deals portion of their business in Atlanta and quickly expanded to other cities in the United States. In April 2011, it was announced that the company raised $1.5 million in financing. The funding was led by New Atlantic Ventures and it and the company planned to use it to expand to more cities and hire more individuals. Prior to this investment from New Atlantic Ventures, the company had received funding for various angel investors in the Atlanta area. The site has been described as a mix between other coupon websites like Groupon and Living Social, but also combining location-based dynamics like FourSquare. Emergence of Shoppe In 2012, the company launched Shoppe by Scoutmob, \\"an ecommerce marketplace showcasing locally-made goods and the creators behind them.\\" The site offers curated content from independent makers, whose products range from clothing and accessories to home goods and food. Prompted by Shoppe's growth, Scoutmob shifted its primary focus towards the ecommerce site in 2014. During the transition, the company was forced to \\"trim its workforce, as the company pivots from commoditized daily deals to artsy e-commerce\\". After the success of Shoppe, Scoutmob's local deals portion scaled back, but continues to provide coupons and curated experiences to users in the Atlanta area under the name Scoutmob Atlanta. Business Model Scoutmob differentiates itself from sites like Living Social, a deal-of-the-day website that features discounted gift certificates usable at local or national companies and Groupon, a deal- of-the-day website that features discounted gift certificates usable at local or national companies. by providing users deals on their mobile phone and by being instantly redeemable. Deals are presented daily and have a \\"limited time discount\\". After choosing the deal, users have the option to have a notification be sent to their email or to have it be directly sent to their mobile phone. Smartphone owners can also redeem the deals on the Scoutmob app. The user can redeem it at their convenience. Although deals move quickly, once claimed, users can take their time to use it. Maker Movement Scoutmob’s emphasis on “celebrating the independent makers by seeking out their inspired goods and crafted experiences\\" places the company at the forefront of the maker movement in the 2010s and Maker culture. Notable Partnerships In 2015, Scoutmob launched a new marketplace on Handmade by Amazon, \\"a new store on Amazon.com for invited artisans to sell their unique, handcrafted goods to our hundreds of millions of customers worldwide\\" Many of the goods sold on Scoutmob's own website are now also available on their Amazon site as well. As of 5 August 2015, the marketplace hosts 357 products.

Unlike the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), which assists homeowners who are in danger of foreclosure, this program benefits homeowners whose mortgage payments are current, but who cannot refinance due to dropping home prices in the wake of the U.S. housing market correction. Background Millions of borrowers found themselves in a difficult predicament after the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2008. As inventories soared nationwide, home prices plummeted. Many new homeowners saw the value of their homes drop below the balance of their mortgages, or nearly so. Later, these same homeowners were prevented from taking advantage of lower interest rates through refinancing, since banks traditionally require a loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of 80% or less to qualify for refinancing without private mortgage insurance (PMI). Take for example a house that was purchased for $160,000 but is now worth $100,000 due to the market decline. Further, assume the homeowner owes $120,000 on the mortgage. In this scenario, the loan-to-value ratio would be 120%, and if the homeowner chose to refinance, he would also have to pay for private mortgage insurance. If the homeowner were not already paying for PMI, the added cost could nullify much of the benefit of refinancing, so the homeowner could be effectively prohibited from refinancing. Program The Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) was created by the Federal Housing Finance Agency in March 2009 to allow those with a loan-to-value ratio exceeding 80% to refinance without also paying for mortgage insurance. Originally, only those with an LTV of 105% could qualify. Later that same year, the program was expanded to include those with an LTV up to 125%. This meant that if someone owed $125,000 on a property that is currently worth $100,000, he would still be able to refinance and lock in a lower interest rate. In December 2011, the rule was changed yet again, creating what is referred to as \\"HARP 2.0\\"; there would no longer be any limit on negative equity for mortgages up to 30 years - so even those owing more than 125% of their home value could refinance without PMI. Also, the program was expanded to accept homeowners with PMI on their loan. Finally, any new mortgage lender was guaranteed not to be held responsible for fraud committed on the original loan. This greatly expanded the willingness of lenders to participate in the program.Glink, Ilyce. What HARP 2.0 can -- and can't -- do for you, CBS MoneyWatch, August 13, 2012. Qualifying criteria Certain criteria must be met to qualify for HARP. While there may be additional criteria imposed by the mortgage servicer, the government requirements are as follows: * The mortgage must be owned or guaranteed by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. Many homeowners are unaware that their mortgages are linked to one of these organizations, since neither Freddie Mac nor Fannie Mae deals directly with the public. * The mortgage must have been acquired by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae on or before May 31, 2009. * The homeowner must not have a previous HARP refinance of the mortgage, unless it is a Fannie Mae loan that was refinanced under HARP during March–May 2009. * The homeowner must be current on their mortgage payments, with no (30-day) late payments in the last six months and no more than one late payment in the last twelve months. * The current loan- to-value ratio (LTV) of the property must be greater than 80%. * The homeowner must benefit from the loan by either lower monthly payments or movement to a more stable product (such as going from an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) to a fixed-rate mortgage). HARP 2.0 and PMI Many people who purchased their home with a down payment of less than 20% of the purchase price were required to have private mortgage insurance (PMI). This is common practice with Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae loans. Having PMI attached to a loan made that loan easier to sell on the Wall Street secondary market as a \\"whole loan\\". PMI hedged the risk brought by the high loan-to-value ratio by offering insurance against foreclosure for whoever owned the \\"whole loan\\". Although HARP 2.0 allows homeowners with PMI to apply through the Making Home Affordable Refinance Program, many homeowners have faced difficulty refinancing with their original lender. HARP requires the new loan to provide the same level of mortgage insurance coverage as the original loan. This can be difficult and time- consuming, especially in the case of lender-paid private mortgage insurance (LPMI). As a result, many lenders are reluctant to refinance a PMI mortgage. Fortunately, HARP 2.0 enables homeowners to go to any lender to refinance, so the mortgage holder is not stymied if the original bank is unwilling to pursue a HARP refinance. Occupancy type HARP 2.0 refinancing is allowed on all occupancy types: primary residence (owner-occupied), second home, or investment (rental) property. However, HARP 2.0 refinancing of investment properties by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has higher mortgage rates than for owner-occupied properties. Appraisal waiver Another feature of HARP is that applicants can forgo a home appraisal if a reliable automated valuation model is available in the area. This can save the borrower time and money, but is subject to the discretion of the mortgage servicer. HARP 3.0 As part of the 2012 State of the Union Address, President Barack Obama referenced a plan to give \\"every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage\\". Within the mortgage industry, this plan is being referred to as HARP 3.0. The plan has not passed. HARP 3.0 is expected to expand HARP's eligibility requirements to homeowners with non-Fannie Mae and non-Freddie Mac mortgages, including homeowners with jumbo mortgages and Alt-A mortgages, those whose original mortgages were stated income, stated asset, or both. Deadline Although the HARP program was originally scheduled to end on December 31, 2016, the Federal Housing Agency announced in August 2016 that it would be extended though September 2017. The program was extended again on August 17, 2017 through December 2018.

It is the racemic counterpart to norlevorphanol. The dextrorotatory stereoisomer of the compound is an active metabolite of dextromethorphan, dextrorphan, and 3-methoxymorphinan, and similarly to them has potent neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects on LTS- and MPTP-treated dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway, but notably without producing any neuropsychotoxic side effects (e.g., dissociation or hallucinations) or having any anticonvulsant actions. It does not seem to bind to the NMDA receptor, and instead, its neuroprotective properties appear result from inhibition of glutamate release via the suppression of presynaptic voltage-dependent Ca2+ entry and protein kinase C activity. In any case, as such, the compound has been investigated as a potential management of Parkinson's disease medication (antiparkinsonian agent). A prodrug, GCC1290K, has been developed on account of 3-HM's poor bioavailability (18%), and a New Drug Application has been approved for it by the United States Food and Drug Administration. It is currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It does not have a Controlled Substances Act 1970 schedule, ACSCN, or annual aggregate manufacturing quota and may not necessarily be controlled, whilst norlevorphanol is; none of the dextrorotary derivatives of the dromoran and norlevorphanol sub-families of morphinan derivatives are controlled as they do not have opioid activity but the other racemic compounds are. 3-HM's levorotatory stereoisomer, norlevorphanol, in contrast to (+)-3-HM, is an opioid analgesic.

The latter cardinal is denoted 2^{\\\\aleph_0} or \\\\mathfrak c. A variety of such cardinal characteristics arise naturally, and much work has been done in determining what relations between them are provable, and constructing models of set theory for various consistent configurations of them.  Background  Cantor's diagonal argument shows that \\\\mathfrak c is strictly greater than \\\\aleph_0, but it does not specify whether it is the least cardinal greater than \\\\aleph_0 (that is, \\\\aleph_1). Indeed the assumption that \\\\mathfrak c=\\\\aleph_1 is the well-known Continuum Hypothesis, which was shown to be independent of the standard ZFC axioms for set theory by Paul Cohen. If the Continuum Hypothesis fails and so \\\\mathfrak c is at least \\\\aleph_2, natural questions arise about the cardinals strictly between \\\\aleph_0 and \\\\mathfrak c, for example regarding Lebesgue measurability. By considering the least cardinal with some property, one may get a definition for an uncountable cardinal that is consistently less than \\\\mathfrak c. Generally one only considers definitions for cardinals that are provably greater than \\\\aleph_0 and at most \\\\mathfrak c as cardinal characteristics of the continuum, so if the Continuum Hypothesis holds they are all equal to \\\\aleph_1.  Examples  As is standard in set theory, we denote by \\\\omega the least infinite ordinal, which has cardinality \\\\aleph_0; it may be identified with the set of all natural numbers. A number of cardinal characteristics naturally arise as cardinal invariants for ideals which are closely connected with the structure of the reals, such as the ideal of Lebesgue null sets and the ideal of meagre sets.  non(N)  The cardinal characteristic non(\\\\mathcal N) is the least cardinality of a non-measurable set; equivalently, it is the least cardinality of a set that is not a Lebesgue null set. Bounding number \\\\mathfrak b and dominating number \\\\mathfrak d We denote by \\\\omega^\\\\omega the set of functions from \\\\omega to \\\\omega. For any two functions f:\\\\omega\\\\to\\\\omega and g:\\\\omega\\\\to\\\\omega we denote by f\\\\leq^*g the statement that for all but finitely many n\\\\in\\\\omega, f(n)\\\\leq g(n). The bounding number \\\\mathfrak b is the least cardinality of an unbounded set in this relation, that is, \\\\mathfrak b = \\\\min(\\\\\\\\{F : F\\\\subseteq\\\\omega^\\\\omega\\\\land\\\\forall f:\\\\omega\\\\to\\\\omega\\\\exists g\\\\in F(g leq^*f)\\\\\\\\}). The dominating number \\\\mathfrak d is the least cardinality of a set of functions from \\\\omega to \\\\omega such that every such function is dominated by (that is, \\\\leq^*) a member of that set, that is, \\\\mathfrak d = \\\\min(\\\\\\\\{F : F\\\\subseteq\\\\omega^\\\\omega\\\\land\\\\forall f:\\\\omega\\\\to\\\\omega\\\\exists g\\\\in F(f\\\\leq^*g)\\\\\\\\}). Clearly any such dominating set F is unbounded, so \\\\mathfrak b is at most \\\\mathfrak d, and a diagonalisation argument shows that \\\\mathfrak b>\\\\aleph_0. Of course if \\\\mathfrak c=\\\\aleph_1 this implies that \\\\mathfrak b=\\\\mathfrak d=\\\\aleph_1, but HechlerStephen Hechler. On the existence of certain cofinal subsets of {}^\\\\omega\\\\omega. In T. Jech (ed), Axiomatic Set Theory, Part II. Volume 13(2) of Proc. Symp. Pure Math., pp 155–173. American Mathematical Society, 1974 has shown that it is also consistent to have \\\\mathfrak b strictly less than \\\\mathfrak d.  Splitting number \\\\mathfrak s and reaping number \\\\mathfrak r  We denote by [\\\\omega]^\\\\omega the set of all infinite subsets of \\\\omega. For any a,b\\\\in[\\\\omega]^\\\\omega, we say that a splits b if both b\\\\cap a and b\\\\setminus a are infinite. The splitting number \\\\mathfrak s is the least cardinality of a subset S of [\\\\omega]^\\\\omega such that for all b\\\\in[\\\\omega]^\\\\omega, there is some a\\\\in S such that a splits b. That is, \\\\mathfrak s = \\\\min(\\\\\\\\{S : S\\\\subseteq[\\\\omega]^\\\\omega\\\\land\\\\forall b\\\\in[\\\\omega]^\\\\omega\\\\exists a\\\\in S(b\\\\cap a=\\\\aleph_0\\\\land b\\\\setminus a=\\\\aleph_0)\\\\\\\\}). The reaping number \\\\mathfrak r is the least cardinality of a subset R of [\\\\omega]^\\\\omega such that no element a of [\\\\omega]^\\\\omega splits every element of R. That is, \\\\mathfrak r = \\\\min(\\\\\\\\{R : R\\\\subseteq[\\\\omega]^\\\\omega\\\\land\\\\forall a\\\\in[\\\\omega]^\\\\omega\\\\exists b\\\\in R(b\\\\cap a<\\\\aleph_0\\\\lorb\\\\setminus a<\\\\aleph_0)\\\\\\\\}). Ultrafilter number \\\\mathfrak u The ultrafilter number \\\\mathfrak u is defined to be the least cardinality of a filter base of a non-principal ultrafilter on \\\\omega. KunenKenneth Kunen. Set Theory An Introduction to Independence Proofs. Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics vol. 102, Elsevier, 1980 gave a model of set theory in which \\\\mathfrak u=\\\\aleph_1 but \\\\mathfrak c=\\\\aleph_{\\\\aleph_1}, and using a countable support iteration of Sacks forcings, Baumgartner and LaverJames Earl Baumgartner and Richard Laver. Iterated perfect-set forcing. Annals of Mathematical Logic 17 (1979) pp 271–288. constructed a model in which \\\\mathfrak u=\\\\aleph_1 and \\\\mathfrak c=\\\\aleph_2. Almost disjointness number \\\\mathfrak{a} Two subsets A and B of \\\\omega are said to be [almost disjoint] if A\\\\cap B is finite, and a family of subsets of \\\\omega is said to be almost disjoint if its members are pairwise almost disjoint. A maximal almost disjoint (mad) family of subsets of \\\\omega is thus an almost disjoint family \\\\mathcal{A} such that for every subset X of \\\\omega not in \\\\mathcal{A}, there is a set A\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A} such that A and X are not almost disjoint (that is, their intersection is infinite). The almost disjointness number \\\\mathfrak{a} is the least cardinality of an infinite maximal almost disjoint family. A basic resultEric van Douwen. The Integers and Topology. In K. Kunen and J.E.

One small building was set on fire during the incident and several people were injured. The Iranian government publicly condemned the violence.The Guardian, Iranian opposition student groups condemn storming of British embassy, 1 December 2011 Background The British government had imposed numerous sanctions on Iran regarding concerns over the nature of Iran's nuclear program. Following the release of a November 2011 International Atomic Energy Agency report that documented weaponisation elements of Iran's nuclear activities, the British government banned all financial institutions in the United Kingdom doing business with their counterparts in Iran, including Iran's central bank. Iran responded by approving a bill to downgrade its ties with the United Kingdom, including a requirement for both countries to withdraw their respective ambassadors. This was not the first time that Iran has called for downgrading ties with the United Kingdom. Incursion About 1,000 people gathered near the embassy to demand that the British ambassador be sent home immediately. The rally began quietly, but some participants stormed the building, breaking down the door, throwing around papers and replacing the British flag with an Iranian one. The Iranian security forces initially did not intervene as protesters entered the British Embassy. Protesters removed the mission's flag and ransacked offices. The protesters chanted, \\"Death to America\\", \\"Death to England\\" and \\"Death to Israel\\", among other slogans. According to the British Ambassador to Iran Dominick Chilcott, protesters rampaged through the embassy building, destroying paintings and furniture, spraying graffiti, smashing windows and starting fires. Seven embassy staff were seized by protesters but were eventually escorted out by police. The protesters also stole mobile phones and computers. British Prime Minister David Cameron described the incursion as \\"outrageous and indefensible\\" and demanded that Iran immediately ensure the safety of all British Embassy personnel. Foreign Secretary William Hague said the \\"irresponsible action\\" had put the safety of diplomats and their families at risk and caused extensive damage to embassy property. Protesters also targeted Gholhak Garden, a British diplomatic compound in northern Tehran whose ownership has been a source of contention between Iranian and UK officials, pulling down a portrait of the Queen and burning an embassy vehicle, as well as British, US and Israeli flags. Iran expressed regret over the attacks and police arrested 12 protesters. Perpetrators Iranian state media agencies and certain international news sources described the protests as a reaction of students against Britain's anti-Iran policies. The demonstrators themselves issued an official statement, declaring, \\"Our actions are a spontaneous reaction of revolutionary students and were not ordered by any state organ.\\" In a statement to the House of Commons on 30 November, Foreign Secretary William Hague said: \\"Iran is a country where Opposition leaders are under house arrest, more than 500 people have been executed so far this year and where genuine protest is ruthlessly stamped on. The idea that the Iranian authorities could not have protected our Embassy or that this assault could have taken place without some degree of regime consent is fanciful\\". Some analysts, media sources and Iranian opposition groups assert that the attack was orchestrated by the Iranian authorities, hence the strong British reaction. Al Jazeera's correspondent in Tehran, Dorsa Jabbari, reported that the Iranian police and various ministries had prior knowledge of the protest, which was organised by the student arm of the Basij. Police reportedly \\"stood back and let the protestors make their way into the compound\\". In the words of The Economist, \\"This was the centre of the capital city . . . If the police had wanted to stop this, they could have flooded the compound with officers and rescued the British. The police, and whoever was pulling the strings behind the attack, chose not to intervene for a long while\\". Jabbari stated, \\"Any such action of this scale can never be independent in the Islamic Republic\\". Dominick Chilcott told the BBC, Iran is a country in which such action is only taken \\"with the acquiescence and the support of the state\\". Effect on international schools The École Française de Téhéran (Tehran's French school) is located on property of the British embassy and had its classes in session as the embassy attack occurred. Several windows at the German Embassy School Tehran (DBST), near the British embassy, were destroyed. The French school, the German school, and the British School of Tehran (BST) closed indefinitely.Ya'ar, Chana. \\"International Schools Close in Tehran\\" (Archive). Arutz Sheva (Israel National News). 12 June 2011. Retrieved on 16 September 2015. The school board of trustees of the BST voted to have the school permanently disestablished, with the end date being 31 December 2011. The DBST acquired the assets of the BST and established an international section in the former BST buildings.\\"To the Friends, Staff, Parents and Children of the British School, Tehran\\". British School of Tehran. April 28, 2012. Retrieved on September 17, 2015. Reactions Within Iran Iran's Foreign Ministry expressed regret over the attack, calling it \\"unacceptable\\" and said that it happened \\"despite the efforts made by the Iranian Law Enforcement Police and reinforcement of the embassy guards\\". Iranian police arrested 12 protesters in connection with the attack. Two Iranian opposition student groups, Tahkim Vahdat and Advar Tahkim, issued statements criticising the attack. Tahkim Vahdat said that those behind it were \\"not true representative of Iranian students, they were affiliated with the authorities in power\\". Iran's Deputy Police Chief Brigadier General Ahmad Reza Radan announced that police have started investigations into the details of the protests, in which angry self-driven protesters raided and occupied the British embassy and its garden in Northern Tehran. Iranian MP Parviz Sorouri, a senior member of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said that \\"the British government's hasty decision to close down the Iranian Embassy in London has created a new situation for both sides. But the Iranian government will do its utmost to stand up for the rights of Iranian citizens living in Britain through the establishment of an interests section in London\\". Subsequently, the Sultanate of Oman agreed to act as a protecting power, representing the interests of Iran through its embassy in London. Within the United Kingdom British Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned the attacks. Following the incident, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office issued a statement saying that \\"we are outraged by this. It is utterly unacceptable and we condemn it\\". Later that evening David Cameron described the Iranian Government's failure to protect the embassy as a \\"disgrace\\". On 30 November 2011, during a speech to the House of Commons, Foreign Secretary William Hague announced that the Iranian Ambassador to the Court of St. James's, his ambassadorial staff and other Iranian diplomats had 48 hours to leave the United Kingdom. The foreign secretary also announced that he had closed the British Embassy, and its staff and dependants had left Tehran. This brought the United Kingdom's relations with Iran to their lowest level, and both the Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister had warned of far more \\"serious consequences\\" towards Iran, for its failure to uphold its international obligations in line with the Vienna Convention. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg told the BBC's Sarah Rainsford that the UK's relationship with Iran had \\"taken a very serious knock\\" but that \\"It doesn't mean we're cutting off all diplomatic relations with Iran. It doesn't mean we are in any way lessening our determination to try to find a diplomatic solution to the nuclear question, which is immensely important to Europe and the whole world, and we will continue to work tirelessly to find a negotiated solution\\". In November 2013, Iran and the UK agreed to end the protecting power arrangements of Sweden and Oman and appointed non-resident charge d'affaires to conduct bilateral relations between London and Tehran. In June 2014, the UK announced that it intended to reopen its embassy in Tehran once practical arrangements had been completed and predicted that Iran would reopen its embassy in London. United Nations The United Nations Security Council condemned the attacks \\"in the strongest terms\\". United States United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described the attacks as an \\"affront\\" to the international community.UK: \\"Serious consequences\\" for Iran attack. CBS News. 30 November 2011. Retrieved 30 November 2011. US Vice-President Joe Biden said he had no evidence the attack on the British embassy in Tehran was orchestrated by Iranian authorities, but it was another example of why the country was a \\"pariah\\". EU member states France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands recalled their ambassadors to discuss the diplomatic matter, with Austria stating they are considering a similar decision. While not recalling its own ambassador, Sweden summoned the Iranian Ambassador to the Swedish Foreign Ministry. Germany offered to act as a protecting power for the United Kingdom's diplomatic duties in Iran; Sweden took on those diplomatic duties as of July 2012. Hungary declined to recall its Ambassador to Iran following a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on 1 December, saying it would cripple normal day-to-day operations due to its limited staff. However the Hungarian government joined its European allies in condemning the incident. Russia and China Russia condemned the attack, stating that the actions were \\"unacceptable and deserve condemnation\\". China did not criticise Iran by name but stated that \\"the relevant action runs counter to international law and basic norms of international relations and should be handled appropriately.\\" Canada On 7 September 2012, Canada closed its embassy in Iran and declared all remaining Iranian diplomats in Canada personae non gratae, ordering them to leave the country within five days. Reopening of the Embassy In August 2015, nearly four years after the closure of the British Embassy in Tehran, and only weeks after reaching a nuclear deal with Iran, it was announced by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in a joint press conference with British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond at the Foreign Ministry in Tehran that the embassy will be reopened as soon as possible. The new round of relations between the two nations are on the account of the JCPOA and in anticipation of strategic relations in the course of coming years. However, a number of Iranian students and people protested against the reopening of the British embassy on Sunday morning in the presence of Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond according to Fars News Agency.

Biography Soepomo was born in Sukoharjo, Central Java, Dutch East Indies on 22 January 1903. He came from a noble family; his maternal and paternal grandfathers were high-ranking government officials. Soepomo began his schooling at the Europeesche Lagere School in Boyolali in 1917, later studying at a Meer Uitgebreid Lagere Onderwijs in Surakarta beginning in 1920. In 1923 he moved to Batavia, where he studied at the Bataviasche Rechtsschool. After graduating, he initially took a job at a court in Surakarta, later going to Leiden, Netherlands to spend three years studying at Leiden University under Cornelis van Vollenhoven. He graduated in 1927, with his thesis, entitled \\"Reorganisatie van het Agrarisch Stelsel in het Gewest Soerakarta\\" (\\"Agrarian System Reform in the Surakarta Area\\"), containing both a description of the agrarian system in Surakarta and veiled critiques of Dutch colonialism. After his return from the Netherlands, Soepomo became a court employee in Yogyakarta, later being transferred to the Justice Department in Jakarta. While serving at the Justice Department, he took a side job as a guest lecturer at the Institute of Law there. He joined the youth group Jong Java, and wrote a paper entitled \\"Perempuan Indonesia dalam Hukum\\" (\\"Indonesian Women and Law\\"), which he presented with Ali Sastroamidjojo at the 1928 Women's Congress. As the Japanese occupation of Indonesia was drawing to a close, Soepomo became a member of the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence and the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence, working to frame the constitution together with Muhammad Yamin and Sukarno. After independence, Soepomo served twice as Minister of Justice, from 19 August to 14 November 1945 and from 20 December 1949 to 6 September 1950. Dr. Supomo visit to the Netherlands in 1951 After his terms as Minister of Justice, Soepomo became a lecturer at Gadjah Mada University, as well as the Jakarta Police Academy. He was also President of the University of Indonesia. From 1954 to 1956, Soepomo was Indonesia's ambassador to the United Kingdom. Soepomo died in Surakarta on 12 September 1958. Honours On 14 May 1965, Soepomo was posthumously declared a national hero of Indonesia by President Sukarno.

It is operated by the Pan-Atlantic University in Lagos, Nigeria, the parent body of the Lagos Business School. The virtual museum went live in the second quarter of 2011, although preliminary work had already started. The initiative was by Jess Castellote, a Spanish architect, and the Virtual museum is managed by Akinyemi Adetunji. It has four virtual floors and over a dozen gallery rooms, each of which is dedicated to a specific period or to a given school. The interactive website now features about 800 works from different artists, including pioneering Nigerian artists such as Aina Onabolu and Bruce Onobrakpeya, and emerging artists such as Richardson Ovbiebo and Babalola Lawson. Some of the objects are held in private collections and are on public display for the first time. The virtual museum complements the Nigerian National Museum, opened in 1957 in the city of Lagos. While the National Museum has an excellent collection that includes works from 900–200 BC, it lacks contemporary work; the virtual museum fills this gap. Castellote has said that he hopes the virtual museum will help unknown Nigerian artists who have produced great works to become better known. He acknowledges that there may be problems, such as ensuring authenticity and accuracy of information, but describes the site as a work in progress that will constantly evolve and improve. The sections of the website resemble rooms and are modelled after major art schools and styles in Nigeria, with the exception of a few rooms dedicated to masters like Ben Enwinwu and Bruce Onobrakpeya, an octogenarian print artist. Featured in the virtual museum are approximately 80 artists, randomly distributed among the rooms. The list is subjective, though prominence and impact on contemporary Nigerian art is a yardstick employed in the selection. The Virtual Museum started small, but plans to build into one of the top educational resources on Nigerian art. The virtual museum will help disseminate and add to the body of existing knowledge on contemporary art in Nigeria. The artwork online are spread to accommodate all themes, styles and type of works (painting, sculpture, materialism, etc.) with major focus currently centred on painting and sculpture. The Virtual Museum is working with Nigerian artists and collectors to pool these works. For protection of artists’ and collectors’ rights, all reproductions/representations of artwork identify the artist who created them and the collection the works belong to; moreover, these artworks are reproduced in low resolution (72 dpi) so as to render them of little commercial use. Adequate consent and permission is requested before works are displayed. The website also provides external links to articles, papers, journals, or other domains providing added information on a subject or artist; this helps users gain a rounded knowledge.

He was an adoptive nephew of Li Keyong's, and served Li Keyong both before and after the destruction of Tang Dynasty.  Background  It is not known when Li Sizhao was born. He was originally a son of a family named Han in Taigu (太谷, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi). When he had just been born, the warlord Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), which included the area, happened to be on a hunt and went near the house. Believing that the house was exuding an unusual aura, he conversed with Li Sizhao's father, who indicated that he had just had a son. Li Keyong purchased the infant by giving his father gold and silk, and took the infant back. He gave the child to his younger brother Li Kerou (), who adopted the child as a son. Li Sizhao's original personal name was Jintong, but was later changed to Sizhao. As he grew, he became a brave soldier even though he had a diminutive stature. He initially favored drinking, but after Li Keyong gave him a mild rebuke, no longer drank for the rest of his life. Li Keyong favored Li Sizhao for his carefulness and tolerance, and made Li Sizhao a commander of his guard corps, often having Li Sizhao accompany him on campaigns.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 36.  Service under Li Keyong  The first campaign in which historical sources described Li Sizhao as himself leading an army was in 897, when Li Keyong's ally Wang Ke the military governor of Huguo Circuit (護國, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) was attacked by his cousin Wang Gong the military governor of Baoyi Circuit (保義, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), who was allied with Li Keyong's archenemy Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan). Both Li Keyong and Zhu sent forces in support of their respective allies, with Li Keyong's army commanded by Li Sizhao. The Xuanwu generals Zhang Cunjing () and Yang Shihou were initially able to defeat Wang Ke and put Huguo's capital Hezhong Municipality () under siege, but Li Sizhao was able to then defeat the Baoyi forces at Yishi () and then at Zhangdian (張店, both in modern Yuncheng) and lift the siege on Hezhong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. In 898, when Wang Ke was set to marry a daughter of Li Keyong's and went from Hezhong to Hedong's capital Taiyuan Municipality to do so, Li Keyong sent Li Sizhao to defend Huguo in Wang Ke's absence. Later in 898, when Li Keyong sent Li Sizhao and Zhou Dewei to try to recover three prefectures east of the Taihang Mountains that he had previously lost to Zhu (Xing (邢州, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), Ci (磁州, in modern Handan, Hebei), and Ming (洺州, also in modern Handan)). However, they were defeated by Zhu's general Ge Congzhou, who subsequently cut off their escape path back into the Taihang. It was due to the effort of Li Keyong's adoptive son Li Siyuan in fighting through Ge's blockade that the Hedong army was able to escape. Yet later in the year, Wang Gong made another attack on Huguo, but when Li Sizhao went to Wang Ke's aid, Li Sizhao was able to repel Wang Gong. Around the new year 899, Li Keyong's subordinate Li Hanzhi the prefect of Ze Prefecture (澤州, in modern Jincheng, Shanxi) seized Lu Prefecture (潞州, in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), then turned against Li Keyong and submitted to Zhu. Li Keyong ordered Li Sizhao to attack Li Hanzhi, and Li Sizhao was able to immediately capture Ze and take Li Hanzhi's family members captive, sending them to Taiyuan. However, Li Keyong subsequently diverted Li Sizhao to try to aid Luo Shaowei the military governor of Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan), who was then under attack from Liu Rengong the military governor of Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing). However, as Liu was subsequently repelled by the Xuanwu generals Ge Congzhou and He Delun () (as Luo also requested aid from Zhu) before Li Sizhao could arrive in Weibo territory, Luo again cut off relations with Hedong, and Li Sizhao withdrew. In Li Sizhao's absence, Li Keyong sent Li Junqing () to attack Li Hanzhi at Lu Prefecture, but Li Junqing was defeated by the Xuanwu generals Zhang Cunjing and Ding Hui. Li Keyong executed Li Junqing and again commissioned Li Sizhao to attack Li Hanzhi. Li Sizhao first recaptured Ze (which Ding had captured) and then put Lu under siege. With Ge having been recalled by Zhu by that point, He Delun abandoned Lu, allowing Li Sizhao to recapture it for Li Keyong. Li Keyong commissioned Meng Qian () as the acting military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered at Lu Prefecture). In late 899, Zhu sent Ge to launch a punitive campaign against Liu, putting Liu's son Liu Shouwen under siege at Cang Prefecture (滄州, in modern Cangzhou, Hebei). In spring 900, Li Keyong sent Li Sizhao to attack Xing and Ming Prefectures to try to relieve the pressure on the Lius. Subsequently, though, Zhu recalled Ge, as Wang Rong the military governor of Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) mediated the dispute, and Ge's army was also itself stalled by rainstorms. By that point, Li Sizhao had captured Ming Prefecture. Zhu sent Ge against Li Sizhao, and subsequently arrived himself with reinforcements. Li Sizhao withdrew, but suffered substantial losses.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. In fall 900, Zhu himself launched a major attack on Chengde and Yiwu Circuit (義武, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei), whose military governor Wang Gao was an ally of Li Keyong's. He first forced Wang Rong to submit, and then attacked Wang Gao. When Zhu defeated Wang Gao's uncle Wang Chuzhi, Wang Gao abandoned Yiwu and fled to Hedong. The Yiwu soldiers subsequently supported Wang Chuzhi to take over the circuit and sue for peace with Xuanwu by submitting to Zhu. During Zhu's campaign, Li Keyong tried to relieve the pressure on Yiwu by sending Li Sizhao to attack Zhu's Heyang Circuit (河陽, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan). Li Sizhao quickly captured Heyang's Huai Prefecture (懷州, in modern Jiaozuo, Henan) and then put Heyang Circuit's capital Heyang under siege. However, he was subsequently repelled by the Xuanwu officer Yan Bao () and forced to withdraw. In spring 901, Li Sizhao recaptured Ze, which had again fallen to Xuanwu forces. However, in a subsequent major attack by Xuanwu forces, commanded by Shi Shucong (), against Hedong, the Xuanwu forces advanced all the way to Taiyuan and put it under siege. The city almost fell, and it was said that it was due to nightly counterattacks by Li Sizhao and Li Siyuan that the siege was unsuccessful. With Xuanwu forces bogged down by rain and running out of food supplies, Zhu recalled Shi. Further, Zhaoyi Circuit was, for the time being, lost to Zhu, as Meng surrendered to Xuanwu forces during the campaign. Zhu commissioned Ding as Zhaoyi's military governor. Later in the year, Li Keyong did send Li Sizhao and Zhou to capture Xi () and Ci (慈州, both in modern Linfen, Shanxi, not the same prefecture as the one east of the Taihang Mountains) Prefectures, which had become under Zhu's control when Zhu conquered Huguo earlier in 901. Later in 901, the powerful eunuchs at the Tang imperial court at Chang'an, believing that then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong of Tang and the chancellor Cui Yin were able to slaughter them, forcibly seized Emperor Zhaozong and took him to Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), then reigned by the eunuchs' ally Li Maozhen. Cui, who was allied with Zhu, summoned Zhu to attack Fengxiang. Li Maozhen wrote Li Keyong to request aid. Li Keyong sent Li Sizhao to attack Jin Prefecture (晉州, in modern Linfen), and Li Sizhao defeated Xuanwu forces at Jin Prefecture. Subsequent battles in spring 902 in which Li Sizhao and Zhou engaged Shi and Zhu's nephew Zhu Youning (), however, could not produce conclusive Hedong victories, and Shi was eventually able to defeat Li Sizhao and Zhou at Pu County (蒲縣, in modern Linfen). They tried to withdraw, but the Xuanwu forces chased them. In the subsequent engagement, Li Keyong's son Li Tingluan () was captured by Xuanwu forces, who then again advanced to Taiyuan and put it under siege. The situation became so dire that Li Keyong, under the advice of his adoptive son Li Cunxin, considered abandoning Taiyuan and fleeing to the north; only at the urging of his wife Lady Liu, as well as Li Sizhao, Li Siyuan, and Zhou, did Li Keyong resolve to defend the city. Li Sizhao and Li Siyuan again led nightly counterattacks against the sieging Xuanwu forces, and eventually, the Xuanwu forces withdrew. Even though Hedong forces were in fact then able to further recapture Ci, Xi, and Fen (汾州, in modern Linfen), it was said that Li Keyong did not dare to again engage Zhu for several years. (Li Maozhen was subsequently forced to sue for peace by surrendering the emperor to Zhu.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. In 903, Li Keyong's officer Wang Jinghui () the prefect of Yun Prefecture (雲州, in modern Datong, Shanxi) rebelled against Li Keyong and submitted to Liu Rengong. Li Keyong sent Li Sizhao and an adoptive son, Li Cunshen, to attack Wang. Liu Rengong sent an army to aid Wang, forcing Li Sizhao and Li Cunshen to hold off on their attack and allowing Wang to take his army and flee to Liu. Even though Li Sizhao and Li Cunshen subsequently defeated another officer who rebelled against Li Keyong, Qibi Rang (), who then committed suicide, and retake Zhenwu (振武, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia), which Qibi had seized, Li Keyong was still angry at them for allowing Wang to escape. He caned them and, for the time being, stripped them of their offices.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. In 906, Luo Shaowei, who distrusted the Weibo headquarters guards corps – as they had a history of assassinating or rebelling against past military governors – slaughtered the headquarters guards with support from Zhu. The other troops were outraged by this slaughter, and the officer Shi Renyu () rebelled and occupied Gaotang (高唐, in modern Liaocheng, Shandong), seeking aid from Li Keyong and Liu Shouwen. He was soon under attack by Xuanwu forces. Li Keyong sent Li Sizhao to attack Xing Prefecture to try to relieve the pressure on Shi, but Li Sizhao was unable to capture Xing, defended by Niu Cunjie (), and was forced to withdraw. Xuanwu forces was then able to capture Gaotang and slaughter Shi and the population of Gaotang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265. Later in 906, Zhu advanced north and again put Liu Shouwen under siege at Cang Prefecture. Liu Rengong sought aid from Li Keyong to try to save Liu Shouwen. Under Li Keyong's demand, Liu Rengong sent troops to join Hedong forces under Li Sizhao and Zhou in attacking Lu Prefecture, to try to recapture Zhaoyi Circuit. When the joint Hedong/Lulong forces reached Lu Prefecture, Ding, who had been mourning Emperor Zhaozong (whom Zhu had assassinated in 905 and replaced with his son Emperor Ai), surrendered Lu to them. Li Keyong made Li Sizhao the acting military governor of Zhaoyi. However, a subsequent attack by Hedong forces on Ze Prefecture was unable to capture it, and therefore only Lu Prefecture was in Hedong hands by that point. In 907, Zhu forced Emperor Ai to yield the throne to him, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang with him as its Emperor Taizu. Li Keyong, along with Li Maozhen (whose territory became Qi), Yang Wo the military governor of Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) (whose territory became Wu), and Wang Jian the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) (whose territory became Former Shu), refused to recognize the Later Liang emperor, and thereafter was effectively the ruler of his own state of Jin (as he had been previously created the Prince of Jin by Emperor Zhaozong). Shortly thereafter, the Later Liang emperor sent the general Kang Huaizhen () to put Lu Prefecture under siege. After a conventional siege failed to capture the city after half a month, Kang built a centipede-like encampment around the city to try to starve it while also using it defensively against any Hedong relief troops. Li Keyong subsequently sent Zhou to command a relief army to try to lift the siege, but while both Li Sizhao and Zhou were able to disrupt the siege operations, Kang's encampment held, and Zhou was unable to lift the siege. By spring 908, with Li Keyong having fallen gravely ill, Zhou withdrew to Luanliu (亂柳, in modern Changzhi). Li Keyong entrusted his oldest biological son, Li Cunxu, whom he designated as his heir, to his brother Li Kening, the eunuch monitor of the army Zhang Chengye, the officers Li Cunzhang and Wu Gong (), and the secretary Lu Zhi (). Before dying, he stated to Li Cunxu:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. Li Keyong, knowing that there was a rivalry between Li Sizhao and Zhou, also told Li Cunxu: Li Keyong then died, and Li Cunxu succeeded him as the Prince of Jin.  Service under Li Cunxu  It was said that, because of the siege, Lu Prefecture was in a precarious position, with its supplies nearly exhausted. During the siege, on an occasion when Li Sizhao held a feast on the city walls for his officers, a stray arrow hit Li Sizhao's foot, but Li Sizhao, without expressing any commotions, quietly removed the arrow, such that no one realized that he was injured. Several times, Later Liang's Emperor Taizu, who had himself joined the siege, sent messengers with his edicts to try to persuade Li Sizhao to surrender; each time, Li Sizhao executed the messenger and burned Emperor Taizu's edict. Eventually, Emperor Taizu, believing that Lu Prefecture would fall anyway soon without aid (as Zhou Dewei had by that point withdrawn back to Taiyuan, to pay tribute to the new prince), left the siege, and further had his general Liu Zhijun return to the Qi front, where Liu had been stationed. Li Cunxu himself had, immediately after becoming prince, had to deal with a conspiracy by Li Kening and an adoptive son of Li Keyong's, Li Cunhao (), to overthrow him, but after executing Li Kening and Li Cunhao, he prepared for a campaign to save Li Sizhao. He put Ding Hui in nominal command of the operation, while he himself, Zhou, and Li Siyuan led the main attacks against the Later Liang centipede encampment. They attacked it under the cover of fog, and the Later Liang forces collapsed and fled. When Zhou subsequently arrived at the city walls and announced that the siege had been lifted, Li Sizhao initially did not believe him, but when Li Cunxu subsequently arrived, wearing white armor (thus signifying that Li Keyong had died), Li Sizhao realized what had occurred and fell into deep mourning before opening the gates to let Li Cunxu enter. (Before the battle, Li Cunxu had told Zhou what Li Keyong had said before his death, and Zhou, in response, fought particularly fiercely during the battle. After the battle, he relayed what occurred to Li Sizhao, and the two reformed a friendship.) In the aftermaths of the siege, it was said that Lu had lost over half of its population due to cold and hunger, and the economy had collapsed. Li Sizhao, in response, encouraged farming and caring for silkworms, and lessened the tax burden on the people. It was said that within several years, Lu was back to prosperity. In fall 908, Li Sizhao and Zhou attacked Later Liang's Jin Prefecture and put it under siege. Later Liang's Emperor Taizu personally went to aid Jin Prefecture, and when Li Sizhao and Zhou heard that the Later Liang emperor would be soon arriving, they withdrew.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. In 914, after Li Cunxu had conquered the territory (then known as Yan) of Liu Rengong's son and successor Liu Shouguang, he advanced south to attack Xing Prefecture. Li Sizhao took his army and joined Li Cunxu in the attack. However, when Yang Shihou arrived to aid the Later Liang garrison of Xing, the Jin army withdrew.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. In 916, while Li Cunxu was in a standoff with the Later Liang general Liu Xun at Wei Prefecture (魏州, Weibo's capital, which had by that point fallen to Jin), the Later Liang general Wang Tan () launched a surprise attack on Taiyuan, which was caught without preparation and nearly fell, escaping that fate only due to the effort of the retired officer An Jinquan (), who commanded a group of retired officers' family members in defending the city. When Li Sizhao heard that Taiyuan was under attack, he immediately sent his officer Shi Junli () with a detachment of cavalry soldiers to head for Taiyuan to aid in its defense. Shi arrived within a day and announced that Li Sizhao's main army was on its way, and then conducted raids on the Later Liang army with An. The next day, Wang withdrew, allowing Taiyuan to remain uncaptured. In 918, Li Sizhao accompanied Li Cunxu during a major battle at Huliu Slope (胡柳陂, in modern Heze, Shandong), in which Jin forces were initially crushed by Later Liang forces (with Zhou killed in the battle), but subsequently, under advocacy by Li Sizhao, Li Jianji (), and Yan Bao (who had surrendered to Jin by that point), he counterattacked, with Li Sizhao and Li JIanji leading the charge, crushing Later Liang forces, allowing the battle to be an overall draw in which both armies lost two thirds of their soldiers. In the aftermaths, Li Cunxu initially sent Li Sizhao to Lulong (where Zhou had been serving as military governor) to oversee it, before later taking the military governorship of Lulong himself and having the eunuch Li Shaohong overseeing the Lulong headquarters.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. In 920, Later Liang forces under Liu Xun attacked Zhu Youqian the military governor of Huguo, a Later Liang general who had recently submitted to Jin. Li Cunxu sent Li Sizhao, Li Cunshen, Li Jianji, and Li Cunxian ()While the Zizhi Tongjian called this individual Li Cunzhi, the real Li Cunzhi was already dead in 908. The description of Cizhou prefect (慈州刺史) matches that of another adopted son, Li Cunxian perfectly. to aid Zhu Youqian. Jin forces defeated Liu's army, causing him to withdraw with substantial losses. In 921, Wang Rong, who had by that point become independent of Later Liang as the Prince of Zhao and was allied with Li Cunxu, was assassinated by his adoptive son Wang Deming, who then took over his domain and changed his name back to the birth name of Zhang Wenli. Li Cunxu, wanting to avenge Wang Rong, launched a campaign against Zhang. Zhang sought aid from the Khitan's Emperor Taizu (Yelü Abaoji), who quickly advanced into Jin's Lulong Circuit. Li Cunxu himself headed north to engage the Khitan emperor, but his army, terrified at the Khitan cavalry strength, had low morale, and Li Cunxu considered, pursuant to some officers' request, lifting the siege on Zhao's capital Zhen Prefecture () and withdrawing. Li Sizhao pointed out that doing so would merely cause the army to collapse. Li Cunxu therefore resolved to engage the Khitan army head-on, and defeated the Khitan army in a battle in which Li Sizhao led successful Jin cavalry maneuvers to save Li Cunxu when Li Cunxu was, at one point, surrounded by Khitan's Xi soldiers. Meanwhile, Li Cunxu had put Yan Bao in command of the siege of Zhen Prefecture, but after Yan suffered a defeat by Zhang Wenli's son and successor Zhang Chujin (Zhang Wenli's having died at the start of the siege), Li Cunxu sent Li Sizhao to replace Yan. Li Sizhao initially had success against raids by Zhang Chujin's soldiers, but during one encounter, a Zhao soldier fired an arrow and hit Li Sizhao in his head. Li Sizhao, who was out of arrows at that point, pulled the arrow off his own head and fired it at the soldier, killing the soldier. However, that night, he died from the wound. Under his final order, the Zhaoyi soldiers at the siege remained under the command of his secretary Ren Huan, and the Zhao army did not find out about Li Sizhao's death. Meanwhile, Li Cunxu, who was mourning Li Sizhao's death, ordered that Li Sizhao's sons escort Li Sizhao's escort back to Taiyuan for burial. Li Sizhao's son Li Jineng (), however, disobeyed the order, took several thousand Zhaoyi soldiers, and headed back to Lu Prefecture with Li Sizhao's casket. When Li Cunxu sent his brother Li Cunwo () after Li Jineng to get him to change his mind, Li Jineng and his brothers not only refused but threatened to kill Li Cunwo, causing Li Cunwo to flee. Subsequently, Li Sizhao's son Li Jitao took control of Zhaoyi Circuit. After Li Cunxu later declared himself emperor of a new Later Tang (as Emperor Zhuangzong), he posthumously created Li Sizhao the Prince of Longxi. Yet later, after Li Siyuan succeeded Li Cunxu (as Emperor Mingzong), he ordered that Li Sizhao be worshipped at the temple for Emperor Zhuangzong.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 52.

He is the author of Out of Shadows, the 2010 Costa Children's Book of the Year. Early life and education Wallace was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, South- West England.Jason Wallace Website Retrieved 28 October 2011. He has quite an interesting family tree as he is a descendant of Lord George Sanger, a world- famous Victorian circus owner, an International English cricketer, and he is also loosely related (through a marriage in the family tree) to J.R.R. Tolkien. Jason lived in London, England in his younger years with his family before residing and attending Peterhouse Boys' School, a boarding school in 1983 in Zimbabwe, Africa. The family emigrated after his mother remarried. At the age of seventeen he aspired for a career as an author and although determined he knew it would be a challenging ambition. Jason spent any free time he had writing and in his younger years he read many non-fiction books and comic books . He was a fan of comic books such as The Adventures of Tintin and Asterix and authors including Dr.Seuss and Richard Scarry. In his childhood, among some of his favorite books were James and the Giant Peach and Danny the Champion of the World. In his adolescent and adult life, he was a fan of Stephen King and James Herbert. Ironically, his least favorite types of literature were history and politics - something he now enjoys reading in great quantities. His experiences in a Zimbabwean boarding school following the Zimbabwe War of Liberation / Rhodesian Bush War laid the building blocks of his first and Costa Children's Book Award winning novel Out of Shadows. Career Jason Wallace had a challenging journey to becoming a published author. Jason Wallace stated that \\"getting published didn't happen overnight, and writing had to become \\"the other job\\" for which I didn't get paid while life continued\\". Jason Wallace's natural talent as a writer was motivated through education. He says he had \\"always had a fertile imagination, but as far as I'm concerned it's the school I need to thank for inadvertently nurturing my will to write through strong discipline (there was no such thing as an excuse. Out of Shadows Out of Shadows was published on 28 January 2010 by Andersen Press. The novel has received extensive recognition (international rights currently sold to USA, Norway, Turkey, Brazil and France) and has established him as a successful published author. Out of Shadows took one year and six months to complete. While he attended a boarding school in Zimbabwe not too long after the Rhodesian Bush War/Zimbabwean War of Liberation ended, Jason Wallace wanted to write a story of what he had seen or experienced. The political scene in Zimbabwe was declining and troubled. This inspired Jason Wallace and he began writing fictional stories of what he was encountering. Though the characters in the novel are not real they served to demonstrate the attitudes or personalities \\"a very few people\\" were portraying. Wallace notes that he \\"came up with the idea of \\"What if...?\\" and took it from there\\" when he was writing Out of Shadows. There may be many similar aspects that his story may share with real life but they are very general details and there is nothing very specific. Out of Shadows is set Zimbabwe during the 1980s and is historically accurate due to the experiences Wallace shared in the novel. It is set after the war when Robert Mugabe has come to power offering hope, land and freedom to black Africans. It is the end of the Old Way and the start of a promising new era. For Robert Jacklin, it's all new: new continent, new country, new school. And very quickly he is forced to understand a new way of thinking, because for some of his classmates the sound of guns is still loud, and their battles rage on... white boys who want their old country back, not this new black African government. Boys like Ivan. Clever, cunning, wicked Ivan. For him, there is still one last battle to fight, and he's taking it right to the very top...\\" Wallace focused on several themes in the novel Out of Shadows such as bullying, racism, politics and morality. The book is cross-over novel, written for both adults and a younger audience of 13+ due to some difficult topics that are being dealt with. Encounters Jason Wallace's second novel, Encounters, was published on 4 May 2017 by Andersen Press. The novel is also set in Zimbabwe, but is very different from Out of Shadows. It was inspired by true events in the 1990s. Personal life Wallace currently resides in South West London, England.

At the end of the Edo period, Tahara Castle was home to the Miyake clan, daimyō of the 12,000 koku Tahara Domain.  History  Tahara Castle is located on a small hill in the city of Tahara, near the root of the Atsumi Peninsula extending into Mikawa Bay. The location was formerly surrounded by inlets, which enhanced its defensive position, and its ability to extend control over shipping in the area. In 1480, Toda Munemitsu (1439–1508), virtually independent warlord of the Atsumi Peninsula during the Sengoku Period, erected the predecessor of Tahara Castle. Threatened by the growing power of the Matsudaira clan under Matsudaira Kiyoyasu to the north, the Toda pledged loyalty to the powerful Imagawa clan based in Suruga. When Matsudaira Hirotada was forced to send his son, the future Tokugawa Ieyasu to Sunpu as a hostage to the Imagawa, he turned to the Toda clan for assistance, but the Toda sent Ieyasu as a hostage to Oda Nobunaga instead, in exchange for a monetary payment. The outraged Imagawa attacked and captured Tahara Castle in 1550. After the defeat of the Imagawa at the Battle of Okehazama 10 years later, Tahara Castle came under the control of the Tokugawa, who used it as a subsidiary fortification to Toyohashi Castle. From 1565 to 1595, Honda Hirotaka and Honda Yasushige served as castellans. Following the Battle of Odawara in 1590, Toyotomi Hideyoshi assigned the Kantō region to Tokugawa Ieyasu and the Toda were dispossessed of their holdings, which were given to Hideyoshi's vassal, Igi Tadatsugu, who rebuilt the moats and stonework. Following the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, Toda Katatsugu was raised back from hatamoto status to a 10,000 koku daimyō, and allowed to return to Tahara Castle, which was now the administrative center of the newly- created Tahara feudal domain in 1601. In 1664, his son Toda Tadamasa was transferred to Amakusa Domain in Bungo Province with an increase in revenues to 21,000 koku and Tahara Domain was reassigned to the Miyake clan, who remained in residence until the Meiji Restoration. Little remains of the original castle aside from portions of the moats and stonework, as all castle buildings were destroyed in 1872 in accordance with the new Meiji government. Within the central keep of the former castle is a Shinto shrine to the ancestors of the Miyake clan, and another dedicated to the famed local scholar Watanabe Kazan, as well as the local Tahara City Museum. When the Tahara City Museum was reconstructed in 1990, a faux yagura and gate were reconstructed.

After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British occupied the whole Indian subcontinent. They introduced a new policy of divide and rule to sustain their occupation in this region. According to this policy, society was divided into two parts, i.e. agricultural and non-agricultural castes. The skilled and educated persons of the community were designated as small castes, or non-agricultural castes. Their real castes were removed from the records and the profession was avowed as their caste. Feudal system This was a feudal system made to keep the youth of society away from learning such skills. According to this system the skilled persons became slaves to the feudal landlords and the agricultural castes, who were rewarded with lands and territories as they were loyal to Britain rather than their own people. The assets of these skilled persons were seized or awarded to feudal Chiefs and their relatives. The people belonging to these castes were deprived of some rights like government jobs, sale and purchase of property (exceeding a particular limit), education, etc. Due to this act the respectable became the most reviled in the society. Their profession became their caste for more than two centuries. So the title of small caste was given by the British to the skilled persons of the society belonging to the major castes of the society. After independence Although the British left after 1947, this plant is rooted so deep that it has had bitter effects till now. It is supposed to be the major cause of division in Pakistani society. But after Independence from the British and Dogra Rules the AJK Government has changed this policy by announcing equal rights. Members of these Castes were also allowed to enlist with their real caste. List of small castes The following Castes were included in Small Castes: *Tarhan: Carpenters *Qamyar: Potters *Lowar: Will forge *Kassaï: Butchers *Mirassi: Travelling musicians, troubadours *Mautchi: Shoemakers **Tobi: Launderers *Darzi: Dressmakers *Jalaye: Tisserands *Lahari: Dyers *Mashqi: Water carriers *Teli: Oil Tycoons *Balwalai: Messengers *Naï: Hairdressers; they are also able to make small operations, they circumcise the newborn ones and are cooks during the festivals and the marriages References Category:Indian caste system ","title":"Small castes"},{"id":"33911906","text":"Main Building of the Institute of Solid State Physics Institute of Solid State Physics is one of the physical institutes at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, currently known as the Georgi Nadjakov Institute of Solid State Physics.
